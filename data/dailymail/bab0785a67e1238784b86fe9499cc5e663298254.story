Christmas television has become as important to the modern festive season as roast turkey and gift giving.

But audiences this year will be left with a distinct feeling of déjà vu, with nearly two-thirds of programmes on the country’s major channels being repeats, believed to be the highest total ever.

Across BBC1, BBC2, ITV and Channel 4, 63 percent of programmes during the two week period from December 20 and January 2 will have been seen before, including vintage hits such as Dad’s Army, The Vicar of Dibley and Morecambe & Wise. This is up from a reported 47.5 percent for the same period last year.

The broadcasters will show a combined total of 670 hours, or nearly four weeks’ worth, of repeats in the fortnight between December 20 and January 2, even recycling episodes of game shows such as Pointless

But it was the BBC which found itself facing particular criticism yesterday after it emerged 62 percent of the festive output on BBC1 and BBC2 will be repeats. Campaigners claimed people do not pay the licence fee to watch programmes ‘for the umpteenth time’ and said the corporation must deliver better value for money.

The 315 repeats broadcast by BBC1 and BBC2 in the two-week period total 331 hours of reused content and include Only Fools and Horses, Eastenders, Blackadder and even repeats of game shows such as Pointless.

The worst offender was again BBC2 - with 74 percent of programmes being repeats, a figure equivalent to last year - prompting accusations the corporation is failing licence fee payers by not providing enough new shows. On Saturday, December 20, Christmas University Challenge and Rik Mayall Lord of Misrule are the only original shows in the channel’s 21 hour schedule.

Last night, a spokesman for The TaxPayer’s Alliance said: ‘“Viewers will be left wondering why the cost of a TV Licence is not coming down when they are being subjected to more and more repeats. Amusing as it is, Licence fee payers will question why it costs £145 a year to watch Dad’s Army for the umpteenth time - if they wanted to watch it on endless repeat, they could buy the DVDs. The BBC has to focus on delivering better value for money or sympathy for the TV tax will continue to wane.’

The Royle Family is one of the 315 repeats broadcast by BBC1 and BBC2 in the two-week period total 331 hours of reused content

ITV are broadcasting vintage sitcom Birds of a Feather 

Excluding news bulletins, between Saturday December 20 and Friday January 2, 62 per cent of the corporation’s output will be repeats, up from just under sixty percent last year, with 315 of the 511 scheduled shows having been seen before by audiences.

Among the tried and tested family favourites will be The Two Ronnies, Mrs Brown’s Boys, and old episodes of Antiques Road Trip and Flog It!

These figures compare to 57 percent for ITV and 72 percent for Channel 4, where viewers will be able to almost daily re-watch comedies such as The Simpsons and Fraiser.

Broadcasters are also delving into the back catalogue for films keep families entertained, with the likes of Sister Act, Calendar Girls and The Eagle Has Landed filling the BBC schedules, with only 18 of the 112 films set to air on BBC1 and BBC2 having not appeared on the channels before.

Despite mounting concerns they are failing to provide enough new programming over the festive period, the broadcasters said they had ensured peak-time viewing hours were dominated by new shows.

A BBC spokesman added: ‘The BBC invests more in television at Christmas than any other UK broadcaster. Well over 90% of programmes in peak time on BBC1 will be brand new, including Roald Dah’s Esio Trot, Harry Hill’s Professor Branestawm and the final two episodes of Miranda, plus specials from Doctor Who, Call the Midwife, Mrs Brown’s Boys and Still Open All Hours. There are some carefully chosen repeats in the mix including family favourites and much loved treats from previous years including Royle Family and Vicar of Dibley.’
