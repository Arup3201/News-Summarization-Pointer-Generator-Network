Recovery plan: Chancellor George Osborne

The longest pay squeeze in history will end next year, with many finally getting a pay rise that beats inflation, experts predicted yesterday.

For five years, the average worker’s wage increases have been well below the rate of inflation, leaving them struggling with rising energy and food bills.

But yesterday the Office for National Statistics said that inflation dropped to 2.1 per cent in November, the lowest rate for four years. 

While the cost of living might rise 
again next month because of increases in energy bills, it is widely 
expected to fall next year to, or even below, the Government’s target of
 2 per cent.

Private
 sector bosses predict they will typically hand out pay rises ‘in the 
region of 2.5 per cent’ in 2014, according to a survey by analysts Xpert
 HR.

If
 inflation – measured according to the consumer prices index – falls to 2
 per cent, this would mean workers finally getting a pay rise that is 
higher than the rate at which the cost of living is rising.

Samuel Tombs, of consultants Capital Economics, said: ‘An end to the squeeze on real earnings is finally in sight.’

Bank
 of England governor Mark Carney said: ‘Inflation has fallen back to 
within a hair’s breadth of the 2 per cent target and the recovery has 
finally taken hold.’

But for public sector workers, who typically earn more than private sector workers, the pay pain continues.

Those
 on salaries of £21,000 or more have been hit by a two-year pay freeze, 
followed by a two-year cap on pay rises at an average of just 1 per 
cent.

The ONS says the average salary is £27,000 – but would be £29,600 if pay had kept up with CPI inflation in recent years.

Bills for many essentials, such as food, are still rising sharply. Food prices are 3 per cent higher than last year

The
 news comes as the economy is growing at the fastest pace since the 
recession began, with business lobby group the CBI hailing the 
‘recovery’.

Last
 week, Chancellor George Osborne told MPs on the Treasury Select 
Committee: ‘As the economy recovers, that is the route to a sustained 
increase in the living standards of the people who live in that economy.

You can’t pretend that the two aren’t connected – that you can have a living standards plan without an economy plan.’

On target: Consumer price inflation is hovering just above the Bank of England's target rates of 2 per cent, official figures showed today

Unchanged: Despite the fall in consumer price inflation retail prices remained unchanged in the month, the ONS said.

Overall, the ONS figures show that the rate of inflation has been falling for the last three months, from 2.7 per cent in September to 2.1 per cent  in November.

However, none of the recently announced energy price rises are included in the figures, with most of the increases coming into effect this month and next month.

Bills for many essentials, such as food, are still rising sharply. Food prices are 3 per cent higher than last year.

Unions have promised to fight for better rises next year if bosses are not generous.

Falling prices: The fall in the cost of food, previously a strong contributor to inflation in recent years, helped inflation lower in November

Frances O’Grady, the general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, said recently: ‘Strike action is always the last  resort. But people are feeling frustrated.

‘If the economy is on the road to recovery then people will want their fair share of the rewards. They’ve been told to tighten their belts for years now. They are looking to have a fair share of that recovery.’

Bob Crow, general secretary of the militant Rail Maritime and Transport Workers’ union, said that it will fight ‘with every tool at our disposal for pay awards and improvements in working conditions.’
