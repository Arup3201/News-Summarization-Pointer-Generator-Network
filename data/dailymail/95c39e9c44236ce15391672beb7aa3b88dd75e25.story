The executions of Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumuran would not stop Prime Minister Tony Abbott from holidaying in Bali.

Many Australians have called for a boycott of the island paradise in anger at the imminent killings. The island hosts more than a million Australian tourists each year, including the prime minister.  

But Mr Abbott told WSFM's Jonesy and Amanda on Friday that he would not boycott Bali. 

'I am one of those Australians who has been several times to Bali on holidays,' Mr Abbott said. 'I've got to say I love my time there.'

'It's a beautiful island with friendly people. It's a magnificent place to stay. 

'I hope over time that more Australians will travel to Indonesia. I hope over time more Indonesians will travel to Australia.

'The short answer is yes I would (still go to Bali). 

'I would hate to think that our understandable dismay and disappointment and even anger at the prospect of these executions... would permanently blight the relationship, because it's too important to both our countries.'

Mr Abbott provoked anger from Indonesian officials in February after he publicly reminded them the Federal Government had donated $1 billion of aid to the country following the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami.

The tsunami devastated the country's Aceh province and the Australian government deployed military personnel to assist in humanitarian relief operations.  

Mr Abbott's aid statement was dismissed by an Indonesian foreign ministry official - who told reporters 'no one responds well to threats'.

It also sparked a social media movement in Indonesia, 'Coin4Abbott', calling on the Indonesian government to return the funds to Australia.  

'Take Back All Money & S**t You Gave Us!' one Twitter user said, posting a picture of a jar of coins. 

Mr Abbott said on Friday that he hoped to make more progress with Indonesia with private, rather than public conversations. 

He requested a phone conversation with Mr Widodo on Thursday but that has not gone ahead yet.  

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has lobbied her counterparts for an exchange of three Indonesian prisoners in Australia for Mr Chan and Mr Sukumaran.

But the Australian Associated Press reported on Friday that Mr Widodo 'laughed' after being questioned by reporters about the issue. 

'No way,' he said.
