There's a lot of talk about England’s midfield diamond but Roy Hodgson could have played any formation and still beaten San Marino and Estonia.

England have not been properly tested since the World Cup but there were positive signs. Jack Wilshere had a good game and I was impressed with his range of passing.

Jack’s not a natural defensive midfielder, but Roy can’t go and buy one — at the moment Jack’s the best man for that role. Jordan Henderson and Fabian Delph also covered well. They are both selfless midfielders and recognised that whenever Wilshere went forward, they had to cover for him.

That all leaves whoever is playing at the tip of the diamond — Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling or Ross Barkley when he’s back — freedom to roam.

The only worry I have is that against better teams we could be outnumbered. At times with Wilshere, Delph and Henderson rotating, they left some gaps. Against 10-man Estonia that’s not a problem but against a good side the ball can change hands quickly and all of a sudden they spring on you.

England are still learning but the good news is that Hodgson now has so many midfield options. The diamond has been fine so far and it allows you to play two up front. It’s in vogue but it’s not the only way to play — just look at Chelsea and Manchester City.

Fabian Delph also did well for England in the midfield engine room and covered Wilshere well on Sunday

If England stay as they are, I would keep the same midfield that started against Estonia with Barkley challenging for the attacking role when he returns. 

Alternatively, we could get more midfield numbers by playing a three, but that changes the dynamic of the strikers — is Roy bold enough to leave out Daniel Sturridge, Danny Welbeck or even his captain, Wayne Rooney?

Both systems leave some talented players on the bench but it’s good to see England now have a real range of attacking options.
