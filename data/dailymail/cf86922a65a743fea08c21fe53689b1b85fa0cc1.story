One in four of the crimes ‘solved’ by Britain’s largest police force last year involved the offender accepting a ‘slap on the wrist’, it emerged last night.

Nearly 30,000 cautions were handed to criminals in London for offences including robbery, drug smuggling and even rape.

They made up a quarter of the 118,000 crimes counted as solved by police in the capital during those 12 months.

Lenient: Hundreds of serious crimes are punished by nothing more than a warning from police in London

Critics said the public and police are being short-changed by a rampant ‘cautions culture’ which lets off serious criminals.

The figures, revealed by a Freedom of 
Information request, showed the Metropolitan Police issued 28,998 
cautions and youth warnings last year.

Among the cautions were 5,843 for
violent attacks, 165 for sexual offences and, astonishingly, five for 
rape.

A total of 180 offenders were 
cautioned for grievous bodily harm or wounding, 131 for robbery and 318 
for drug trafficking.

Police handed out 205,700 cautions nationwide in 
the 12 months ending in September 2012, according to the Ministry of 
Justice.

Among them were 40,148 for drug offences, 13,466 for violent assaults, 2,726 for burglary and 1,422 for sex attacks.

The figures represented a 12 per cent 
decrease compared with the previous 12 months, and a 44 per cent fall 
from 2007 when cautions peaked at 367,300.

Last month, Policing Minister Damian 
Green announced a review of guidelines for issuing police cautions as 
part of a wider crackdown. Mr Green said the Government’s goal was to 
see the use of cautions restricted to ensure serious criminals would 
never escape punishment.

The review, due to report next month, 
will examine whether cautions should  be banned for some offences. 
There  are fears that victims of violent and even sexual crimes are 
subject to a postcode lottery where attackers in some areas  are more 
than twice as likely to escape with a caution.

Ministers are also concerned at the way repeat offenders receive cautions for multiple crimes.

Crackdown: Ministers are hoping to discourage the use of cautions by Scotland Yard and other police forces

Tony Arbour, a Tory politician in 
London who uncovered the data, said justice was not being done and those
who receive cautions ‘escape punishment’.

A Met spokesman said the force follows
national guidance and cautions are issued only in the case of serious 
offences after discussions with prosecutors.

He said the force ‘supports’ the use of cautions, which are mostly used to deal with first-time offenders.

He added: ‘A caution is a serious matter, which can have significant consequences for the person’s future employment.’
