Contact: A source reporting directly to the FBI had more than one meeting with Osama bin Laden in 1993 and 1994- contradicting earlier government reports

Newly-released court documents have revealed that an FBI source had a meeting with former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden in 1993.

The meeting between the informant that the FBI worked with and the now-dead terror chief produced such specific intel for the FBI that they were able to thwart an attack against a British cruise liner and another in Los Angeles.

The previously-unknown meeting came to light because Bassem Yousssef, a disgruntled FBI agent, filed a discrimination lawsuit against the agency, and during the court hearing, one of his bosses told of the agent's successes at the bureau.

The Washington Times reported that former FBI official Edward Curran testified on Mr Youssef's behalf in the 2010 discrimination case.

Mr Curran told the court how Mr Youssef was able to cultivate a source who was closely-tied to another al Qaeda leader, Omar Abdel-Rahman, commonly known as the 'blind Sheik' who was responsible for the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center.

The source, who was described as being 'very in tight, close' with the al Qaeda leadership, was reportedly in regular contact with the FBI when he met personally with bin Laden at some point in 1993.

As a result of that meeting, the FBI was given enough information to stop planned attacks on a Masonic lodge in Los Angeles and helped reveal two previously-secret terror cells in California.

'It was the only source I know in the bureau where we had a source right in Al Qaeda, directly involved,' said Mr Curran, who headed the FBI's office in Los Angeles at the time.

The Washington Times revealed no further details about the British cruise liner that was reportedly suggested as a potential target.

The news of the FBI's source meeting with bin Laden on more than one occassion in 1993 and 1994 will make waves because it comes in direct contrast to previous testimony that was used as the 'accepted' timeline of events leading up to the September 11 attacks.

The 9/11 Commission Report described the FBI's intelligence on bin Laden at the time as being 'at best cloudy' and made no mention of a source who had direct contact with the terrorist.

Leader: The source was close with 'blind Sheik' Omar Abdel-Rahman, the al Qaeda official who was reportedly behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center

It is unclear why the courtroom revelations- which were initially made in 2010- were not unearthed until now but the former head of the 9/11 Commission argues that the source was not directly related to the plot against the World Trade Center.

'Both the commission and the U.S. government compiled a fair amount of evidence about the activities of the set of groups later best known as al Qaeda during [the early-1990s], when the group was settling into Sudan. We did not delve as deeply in this period because it was so distant from the plotting that led directly to the 9/11 attack,' Philip Zelikow, the 9/11 Commission's executive director, told The Washington Times.

The discrimination case came after Mr Youssef filed a suit against the bureau saying that he was sidelined after September 11 because his colleagues thought he was an Arab Muslim.

Those assumptions were incorrect, as the highly decorated agent is actually Coptic Christian.
