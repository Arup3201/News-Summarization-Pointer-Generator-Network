Free: Paedophile Gary Karn 48, sexually assaulted two girls aged seven and eight on an allotment but has been spared jail

A man who sexually abused two little girls as they picked fruit at his allotment has avoided jail because a judge ruled it would be unfair to the attacker’s own family.

Gary Karn, 48, inappropriately touched his victims, aged seven and eight, after inviting them into his greenhouse to help themselves  to raspberries as they played at nearby allotments owned by one of their fathers.

But he escaped with a suspended sentence after a judge decided that it would cause ‘suffering’ for his family.

The father of one of the girls, who both had to give evidence to Norwich Crown Court, said the judge’s decision showed no recognition of the impact the assault had on his eight-year-old daughter.

‘He talks about the effect on the offender’s family, but what about the effects on my family?' he said.

Father-of-three Karn, a food processing factory worker from Norwich, was found guilty of three counts of sexual assault against  a child.

The court heard he invited the girls on to his allotment. He told them that he needed to brush spiders off them then put his hands up the top of one girl, and down the trousers of the other.

He was also charged with six counts of possession of extreme pornography and one count of possession of indecent photographs of a child.

Judge Mark Lucraft decided not to proceed with these offences but took them into consideration.

He gave Karn an 18-month suspended sentence, saying an immediate jail term would unfairly affect his family.

‘I have to consider the impact on 
them – people who are not in any way at fault yet might suffer serious 
hardship from your actions,’  he said.

Jude Durr, defending, had told the judge: ‘Imprisonment will almost certainly lead to him losing his job.

If he loses his liberty and they lose
 their house, that would have pretty devastating consequences on the 
family circumstances.’

The decision outraged the victims’ 
families, who said the girls have been left traumatised from both the 
incident and the ordeal of having to give evidence in court.

The father of the eight-year-old added: ‘I find it all very disgusting. The judge has been too lenient.’

He told how the two girls were 
playing on his allotment last September when Karn invited them to pick 
vegetables and fruit on his plot.

The next morning the mother of one 
the girls overheard the pair saying they ‘didn’t want to talk to the man
 down the allotment’ again.

The girls then told what had happened
 after breaking down in tears when preparing a salad using vegetables 
from Karn’s allotment.

The father added: ‘I feel totally let down. The judge lives in cloud cuckoo land.

‘It has caused arguments between me and my wife – it happened on my watch. It has caused a lot of anguish and grief.’

He added: ‘I told my daughter that 
she wouldn’t have to see that man ever again and it is all over and done
 with and now he is going to be walking around – how do you explain that
 to an eight-year-old? It will just confuse her.

‘We have put her through this –and ourselves – and for what? If I had known the outcome I would not have bothered.’

He continued: ‘I’ve worked with 
people who have lost their livelihoods when they’ve had points deducted 
from their licences and been banned from driving for minor driving 
offences yet a paedophile is allowed to walk the streets? It is 
ridiculous.’

Talking about how it has affected his
 daughter, the father added: ‘There are noticeable little differences. 
She won’t stay upstairs in bed any more if her mum gets up and she 
carries her teddy everywhere as a comfort toy.

‘What scares me is that I am one of 
those parents who encourages my children to talk to people and 
acknowledge them when they are spoken to. The allotment is the last 
place I would have expected this to happen.’

Judge Lucraft suspended Karn’s sentence for two years and banned him from working with children for five years.

He was also ordered to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and was given a five-year sexual offences prevention order.

Karn last night insisted that he is innocent and said his wife Jane was standing by him.

He said: ‘I was not guilty, but I was
 done for it and there is not much that I can do about it now.  I don’t 
want to stir things up too much more, now I am on a suspended sentence.

‘I didn’t get off lightly because I 
didn’t do anything to start with. I was just brushing spiders off the 
girls and now I am getting hammered for it.’
