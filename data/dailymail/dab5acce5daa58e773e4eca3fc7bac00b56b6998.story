A little-used airport which is 70 miles from the capital has been renamed London Ashford ahead of work to transform it into a busy passenger hub 

Construction work on a 965ft extension of the runway at Lydd airport in Kent, which once handled more passengers a year than Gatwick, will begin this year and will eventually lead to a new terminal being built.

This month pre-qualified contractors will be invited to submit offers for the runway work at Lydd.

The £25 million development at Lydd will enable the airport to handle aircraft up to the size of Boeing 737s or Airbus A319s.

At present, the runway is only long enough to cope with smaller aircraft on short flights, with Lydd Air running services to Le Touquet in France.

The start of the runway extension ends years of uncertainty for the Kent airport. 

A long planning process finally ended in April 2013 when the Government gave the go-ahead for the runway extension and the terminal.

The development had been subject to a public inquiry which lasted from February to September 2011.

Plans had been submitted as early as the year 2000 and were agreed in 2010 by Shepway District Council before the decision was taken to hold a public inquiry.

Lydd opened in 1954 and for a time there were daily servies to Le Touquet and Ostend.

 In 1958 a total of nearly 223,000 passengers passed through Lydd - nearly 37,000 more than at Gatwick.

By the 1960s Lydd had become an internationally-recognised airport with film stars such as Gregory Peck and Humphrey Bogart regularly flying in and out.

But the expansion of Gatwick cast a shadow over Lydd and its influence waned.

Now the airport's chief executive Charles Buchanan is looking forward to showcasing Lydd's plans at international aviation events this year.

He said: 'We look forward to spreading the word about our ambitious investment plans with airlines, tour operators and other travel businesses attending these events.

'These events attract high-level decision-makers and buyers from across the travel and aviation industries worldwide and provide an excellent platform for us to explore new business opportunities.

'London Ashford Airport is the perfect base for airline operators. 

'Our runway extension will enable regional jet aircraft to fly a full payload of passengers to a wider range of destinations across Europe.

'We are also providing much-needed additional airport capacity in the south east of England.

'We offer easy access to the motorway network, just 20 minutes to Ashford which also has a high-speed rail link that gets you into central London in just 38 minutes.' 

Oxford Airport is also known as London Oxford Airport, despite being 61 miles from the capital.
