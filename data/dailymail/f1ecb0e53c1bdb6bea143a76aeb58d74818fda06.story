A science-fiction fan who collects giant film props is selling a giant Star Wars replica after his girlfriend said she'd had enough it it.

But Martin Fillery, 42, says he will use the proceeds from the sale of the £10,000 Imperial Scout Walker to buy more toys.

And the musician from Ston Easton, outside Bath, has his eye on the Ectomobile ambulance from the hit 1984 film, Ghostbusters.

Mr Fillery's two-legged machine - full name All-Terrain Scout Transport - appeared in 1983 hit Return Of The Jedi, where evil Stormtroopers used a fleet to attack the forest moon of Endor.

He bought the wood and metal replica a few years ago and kept it outside, but his girlfriend, who does not want to be named, has run out of patience with the 16ft contraption that dwarfs their pretty stone cottage, and so Mr Fillery has put it on internet auction site eBay.

The Imperial Walker comes complete with blasters as well as a trailer to cart around the iconic piece of Star Wars imagery.

He hopes the AT-ST - known by fans as a 'chicken walker' because of its bird-like body and long legs - will go to a good home.

Mr Fillery, a musician, said: 'I bought it about six months ago from a group of Star Wars enthusiasts up north who built it.

'They had run out of money, so I jumped at the chance to buy it - I've now had about as much fun as I can have from it.

'Just imagine having a giant Imperial Scout Walker parked outside your house - you'd never get visits from double glazing salesman.'

Mr Fillery, whose collection includes a Tardis, and Incredible Hulk, several Ewoks and a Batmobile, initially bought the AT-ST to use as a stage prop with his Star Wars themed band, Hollywood's Finest.

He said: 'I think my girlfriend is starting to get a bit worried about me. I've always been a bit mad, and I love sci-fi stuff, but my spending on props is going through the roof.

'We've got well over £100,000 worth of kit and costumes, I got someone to build me a full-size loader from the film Aliens. I paid him £400 a week to build it.

'The Scout Walker is amazing, but I realised pretty quickly that it was just too big to use as on stage, so I'm selling it so I can get more toys.'

He added: 'I'm going to use the money to get two different versions of the Batmobile, and Echo1, the Ghostbusters ambulance. I do love my toys.'

Mr Fillery, who estimates his collection of film props to be worth more than £100,000, admits 'I am mad'

The Imperial Walker, which towers over Mr Fillery's west country cottage, is for sale for £9,800 after six years
