Terror: Shopworker Rajbar Kaur, 31, was behind the till at the Lucky Superstore, in Abertillery, South Wales, when the man came in and held a gun to her head

Shock: Rajbar Kaur was behind the counter when the masked robber casually walked in and pulled out the revolver. She said what shocked was how casual he seemed when he walked in

During the ordeal the raider pointed the handgun at Rajbar's temple and said: 'I can shoot you.'

Rajbar said: 'It was really scary. When I remember it I still shiver. He just said: 'Open the till'. I thought somebody was joking with me.

'He had the gun on me and he said: 'I can shoot you.' I knew there was not much in the till. As soon as he opened it he said: 'Where is the rest of the money?'

'I can shoot you': During the ordeal the raider pointed the handgun at Rajbar's temple and said: 'I can shoot you'

Getaway: After not finding any money in the till, the robber stole some cigarettes and Ms Kaur's handbag and left through the door

Child present: Incredibly, Ms Kaur's six-year-old nephew was in the shop at the time of the attack and walks into frame just as the robber leaves

'Then he used the F word, he said 'Move, I need the cigarettes' and he took my handbag.

'What shocked me is he came into the shop in a very casual way.'

Family friend Julie Paget, 63, from Blaina, South Wales, said: 'It's unbelievable. We live in the Valleys, not in a city.'

Rajbar said: 'I believe this is the safest place to live. I still do. We have faith in this place.'

Police are appealing for information about the robbery.

The man wore a blue hoodie and spoke with a local Welsh accent. Anybody with information is asked to call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
