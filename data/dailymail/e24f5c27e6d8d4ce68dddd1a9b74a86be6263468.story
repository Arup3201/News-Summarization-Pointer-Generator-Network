Women should start their family by the age of 35, leading fertility experts have advised

Women should start their family by the age of 35, leading fertility experts have advised.

The medics and IVF researchers said that family planning shouldn’t be just about avoiding pregnancy - it must also tell women about the risks of delaying motherhood.

Without such information, those who are left childless could be ‘haunted’ by their decision to wait.

The Newcastle University experts also said women shouldn’t necessarily use their career as an excuse to delay motherhood – as working life doesn’t get easier with age.

And they questioned whether today’s couples are less willing to put up with financial hardship than previous generations.

Professor Mary Herbert, one of Britain’s leading reproductive biologists, said: ‘The most important message is for women to have their babies before the clock strikes 12.

‘I would be getting worried about my daughter if she hadn’t had a child by 35.’

The stark message, delivered at the British Science Festival comes as growing numbers of women wait to start a family.

Nearly half of all babies are now born to women aged 30 and older and the number of children born to women in their late 30s has almost trebled in recent years.

Britain’s biggest science conference heard that while some women will be lucky enough to become pregnant in their 40s or 50s, many face heartbreak.

Fertility also falls sharply after the age of 35 and IVF far from guarantees a couple a child.

Those who do fall pregnant, face greater health risks than younger women – as do their unborn babies.

Older mothers are more likely to miscarry, as well as have complicated pregnancies and deliver babies that are underweight or premature.

Stillbirths are more than twice as common in over 35s than younger women, while deterioration of their eggs with time also leaves them at greater risk of having babies with Down's syndrome and other genetic disorders.

Finally, their age makes them more prone to arthritis, depression, cancer and heart attacks as they bring up their children.

Professor
Judith Rankin, who specialises in the health of mothers and their 
children, said: ‘The big message is that I don’t think women understand 
the risks.’

Jane Stewart, an IVF doctor at the Newcastle Fertility Centre, said that although the message isn’t new, not enough women are aware of it.

She said that family planning should involve planning as well as contraception.

‘We all plan families now, use contraception.  Family planning is often seen as a way of avoiding teenage pregnancies, avoiding people being pregnant when they don’t want to be because it doesn’t fit in with their life or social life or whatever else.

‘But family planning has to include when you are going to have your children as well.’

Dr Stewart said that if women are not made aware of the risks of delaying motherhood, they may later bitterly regret their decision.

She said: ‘If you look back and regret it, it will haunt you.

‘The risk is that you will always be troubled by the “what if”.’

Dr Stewart, who is secretary of the British Fertility Society, also stressed that IVF is far from failsafe.

Official figures show that just one in four of the 40,000 women who have it each year have a baby. 

And, just like natural conception, it becomes less successful with age.

The fertility doctor said: ‘I find it heartbreaking when people come to my clinic and say that they put it off for such and such and now it’s not happening and actually I can’t help them either.

‘We can’t get away from the age-related decline in fertility.’

The all-female panel acknowledged the cost of childcare and some companies’ reluctance in allowing women to work part-time.  But they also questioned some women’s reasons for delaying starting a family.

Professor Herbert said: ‘From talking to young women, it’s about getting my career established, but in a sense I find that misguided because there is no career that gets less busy as you go on.’

Dr Stewart said: ‘Couples feel they want to be established. They want to own their house, they want to be in good jobs before they start a family.  So the idea of bringing up children is perhaps frowned on in a way that people didn’t think about before.’

Natika Halil, of the Family Planning Association, said: ‘Conversations about planning a family are important as is accurate information about contraceptive choice.

‘Women are mindful of their fertility and any discussion should be done without scaremongering.

‘Fertility doesn’t disappear after 35 and doesn't stop overnight. ’

Josephine Quintavalle, of campaign group Comment on Reproductive Ethics, congratulated the Newcastle team for speaking out.

She said: ‘Well done to Newcastle for underlining something that should be very obvious. 

‘It is sad that we have to point out the obvious but it is a basic message of nature that fertility is time limited.’
