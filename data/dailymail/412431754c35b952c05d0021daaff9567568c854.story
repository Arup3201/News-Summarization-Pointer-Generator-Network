A 19-year-old man was arrested on Friday after allegedly admitting to drowning his pregnant girlfriend and trying to burn her body to get rid of the evidence. 

The body of suspect Courtney Hyriease Velasques'  18-year-old girlfriend Dawanna Thomas was found in a field on Valentine's Day, as firefighters tried to extinguish a blaze. 

She was four months pregnant with a baby girl at the time of her death.

Thomas' body was found partially burned on Valentine's Day in a field in Bexar County, Texas 

Bexar County Sheriff's Office officials arrested her 'jealous' boyfriend Velasques at his home less than a week after her body was found.

They say he confessed to drowning his girlfriend in Salado Creek before trying to burn her body in a field off Schuwirth Road. 

'He stripped her, put her in a bag, he put a log over the bag in the middle of a creek, and then moved the body, he moved it to another location,' Rosanne Hughes with the Bexar County Sheriff's Office told Fox San Antonio.

Thomas' mother Tear Bedford  confirmed to News 4 San Antonio that the unborn child was Velasques'.  

Velasques allegedly admitted committing the crime to officers, saying he drowned his girlfriend in a creek before trying to burn her body to rid the evidence 

She says the couple had been dating for about six months but that they had a toxic relationship  

'He's always been violent, take her money, take her phone, break her phones, every month break her phone,' Bedford said. 

She says she tried to warn her daughter - but to no avail. 

'This dude is gonna kill you, and that's just what he did,' added Bedford. 

Now she wants Velasques put to death for killing her daughter.  

'I still want to see justice even though he's locked up. To me, that's not justice served. I'm seeking the death penalty for whoever had hands in it,' Bedford went on to say.

Velasques faces the death penalty if convicted. He has a criminal record as a juvenile but the multiple capital murder charges are his first as an adult.
