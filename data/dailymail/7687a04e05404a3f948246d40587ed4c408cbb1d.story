China and South Korea yesterday condemned the Japanese prime minister for visiting a shrine that honours war dead including convicted war criminals.

Beijing called the visit ‘absolutely unacceptable’ while government officials in the South Korean capital, Seoul, told of their ‘regret and anger’.

Japan’s neighbours see the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo as a symbol of Japanese militarism.

Yesterday US officials said they were ‘disappointed’ by the visit and warned it would ‘exacerbate tensions’ in the region.

Currently
 Japan, China and South Korea are at loggerheads over the ownership of 
certain islands in the East China Sea. Some analysts fear the unstable 
totalitarian regime in North Korea could also be dragged in to the row.

Prime minister Shinzo Abe said his Boxing Day visit, which was televised live, was an anti-war gesture.

But
 China and South Korea see the shrine as a symbol of Tokyo’s aggression 
during the Second World War, when Japan occupied large areas of China 
and the Korean peninsula.

Japan entered an unwritten agreement with China in the 1970s which suggested that serving leaders would not visit the shrine.

Mr Abe's visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi went there in 2006

Mr
 Abe’s visit to Yasukuni was the first by a serving Japanese prime 
minister since Junichiro Koizumi in 2006. Wearing a morning suit and 
grey tie, Mr Abe spent 15 minutes at the shrine to show what he said was
 his opposition to war.

Television
 cameras recording the visit were not allowed into the inner shrine, 
where he paid his respects to the war dead. Immediately afterwards Mr 
Abe said he ‘prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their
 precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace’.

‘I
 chose this day to report (to the souls of the dead) what we have done 
in the year since the administration launched and to pledge and 
determine that never again will people suffer in war,’ he said.

Hoping
 to dampen the growing protests about the visit, Mr Abe added: ‘It is 
not my intention at all to hurt the feelings of the Chinese and Korean 
people.’

The prime minister’s aides said his visit was in a private capacity.

Despite
 Mr Abe’s attempts to keep the peace with his neighbours,  Chinese 
foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said: ‘We strongly protest and 
seriously condemn the Japanese leader’s acts.’

The Yasukuni shrine was built in 1869 under Emperor Meiji in memory of the country’s war dead.

The
 shrine contains the remains of some of those commemorated, but is 
mostly a symbolic destination for relatives. However the souls of 
hundreds of convicted war criminals are also enshrined there.

They include Second World War leader General Hideki Tojo, who was put to death for war crimes in 1948.
