The secret waiting list scandal that led to a national focus on the problems plaguing the Veterans Affairs administration is 'just the tip of the iceberg,' Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn said today in issuing a report on the department's history of misconduct.

'This report shows the problems at the VA are worse than anyone 
imagined,' Coburn said in a statement. 'The scope of the VA’s incompetence – and Congress’ 
indifferent oversight – is breathtaking and disturbing.'

The Republican senator conducted a year-long investigation into 
the VA and found that more than 1,000 veterans died over the last 
decade as a result of the VA's incompetence, and taxpayers footed the bill for $845 million in medical malpractice payments.

The VA has a long history of mismanagement, dating back to president George W. Bush's administration, but the appetite for reform ripened only after a retired physician at a VA hospital in Phoenix, Arizona, came forward earlier this year with allegations that more than 40 veterans in the Phoenix area had died while waiting for care.

Veterans at that hospital were routinely put on secret waiting lists, the whistleblower, Dr. Sam Foote, said, to cover up to cover up how long it was actually taking VA doctors to see vets for the first time.

Official documents showed that veterans were being seen within two weeks to a month of requesting an appointment, as required by VA guidelines. In reality, they were waiting months on end.

Around the time of the Phoenix revelations, other VA whistleblowers came forward, reporting similar behavior at their facilities. The Office of the Inspector General was subsequently compelled to launch a system-wide investigation into the VA's facilities across the country.

The VA launched it's own investigation, spearheaded by the White House, as well, and two VA officials, including Secretary Eric Shinseki, stepped down.

The department's internal audit of 731 medical facilities was released last Thursday. It showed that more than 56,000 veterans waited more than 90 days for their initial appointments.

More than 10 percent of veterans seeking care faced wait times of more than 30 days, the report said, contradicting government claims the week before that only 4 percent of vets weren't seen in a timely manner.

Many VA schedulers were motivated to lie about wait times in order to receive goal-based bonuses, the audit discovered.

A scheduler at the Phoenix hospital confirmed to CNN in an interview that aired Monday night that she was told to put new requests for appointments on a 'secret list' in a drawer instead of in the VA's appointment scheduling program.

The scheduler, Pauline DeWenter, said she decided to report her hospital to the authorities after she called a veteran's home to follow-up on an appointment request and found out he had passed away.

DeWinter said she'd note in a veteran's records if he had died before receiving care, and on at least seven occasions, someone went back and changed the information to cover up the death.

'So if you change
 that to, "entered in error" or, my personal favorite, "no longer 
necessary," that makes the death go away. So the death would never be 
reported then,' she said.The Office of Special Counsel told President Barack Obama in a letter on Monday that the VA's behavior shows a 'troubling 
pattern of deficient patient care' and its Office of Medical Inspector repeatedly ignored the testimony of whistleblowers.

'This approach has prevented the VA from 
acknowledging the severity of systemic problems and from taking the 
necessary steps to provide quality care to veterans,' U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said.

Sen. Tom Coburn's report noted that a lack of funds isn't the VA's problem, it's waste and abuse of taxpayer resources. In 2011 the VA held a conference at the Orlando World Center Marriott and attendees were treated to lavish spreads of cheeses and breakfast sandwiches yet still received meal reimbursements from the government

The VA held an 11-day conference at the DoubleTree Paradise Valley Resort in Scottsdale, Arizona, for 40 employees in 2011 to the tune of $220,000

Likewise, Coburn said his own investigation 'found the problems at the VA are far deeper than just 
scheduling.' The criminal behavior at the VA is 'pervasive' he said.

Among the examples included in his report was a nurse at Lexington, Kentucky's Veterans Affairs Medical Center hospital who was charged with murder after she gave a veteran too much morphine and he died. The nurse pled guilty to involuntary manslaugher, but was only sentenced to time served eight days. Two other patients of the nurse 'died under suspicious circumstances' involving morphine, as well, according to a local news report.

The head of security at the Bedford VA Medical Center pleaded guilty to 
charges 'two sadistic kidnapping, rape and murder conspiracies,' 
according to the FBI.

A male neurologist at the Colmery-O’Neil Medical Center in Kansas was placed on paid administrative leave for two years after five female veterans filed sexual misconduct charges against him. It took the VA two months after his arrest to suspend him without pay and a year to terminate his employment. The neurologist eventually admitted to 'conducting inappropriate pelvic and breast examinations on patients.'

Another doctor who worked at Colmery-O'Neil at the same time was hired within two years of being acquitted of sexual harassment charges by 16 former patients.

A social worker at an Oregon VA hospital was paid for a year after she was placed on leave for having sex with one of her patients and 'socializing with five clients.' She was paid $65,000 a year in salary before she was fired and 'stripped of her license' by the Oregon Board of Licensed Social Workers.

'In these cases, paid administrative 
leave is the equivalent of disciplining a misbehaving child by 
suspending his chores while continuing to pay him an allowance,' Coburn 
said.

Just as troubling is that Coburn's report is based on information on information readily available to the VA - and the public.

The 124 page document is merely a compilation of Government Accountability Office and Office of the Inspector General reports and accounts of the VA's bad deeds in local and national newspaper.

This is how backed up one VA office is on processing veterans claims, Coburns report said

'The vast majority of VA employees are dedicated public servants who 
demonstrate genuine passion to care for veterans and their families 
every day. At VA, we depend on the service of VA employees and leaders 
who place the interests of veterans above and beyond self-interest,' the
VA said in a statement on Tuesday.

Coburn released his report as members of the House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees were convening for a joint conference on similar bills passed by their respective chambers that would allow veterans to go to hospitals outside the VA network to get care.

The House's bill bans bonuses for VA 
employees until the end of 2016, while the Senate's bill only bans 
scheduling-based bonuses.

The bills would also give the VA permission the money to open 26 to 27 new hospitals in order to meet growing demands for appointments.

Coburn says that a lack of funding  is not the VA's problem, however, it's waste and abuse.

The department spent $220,000 on an 11-day conference at a Scottsdale, Arizona resort in 2011. The cost for 40 employees who attended to stay at the Doubletree Paradise Valley Resort was more than $90,000, and the contractor who organized the event was paid upward of $100,000.

The same year the VA spent a total of $6.1 million on two conferences in Orlando, Florida. Attendees handsomely rewarded with artisan cheese spreads and SWAG like notebooks and water bottles and were treated to karaoke and daily recap videos of the conference that cost $16,500 to produce.

'As is typical with any bureaucracy, the excuse for not being able to 
meet goals is a lack of resources.  But this is not the case at the VA 
where spending has increased rapidly in recent years,' Coburn said.
