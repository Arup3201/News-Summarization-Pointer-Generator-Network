Found: Police acting on a tip tracked down missing schizophrenic mother of two Catherine Hoggle, 27, in Germantown, Maryland 

The missing paranoid schizophrenic mother from Maryland was found and taken into custody Friday night, but the search for her two children continues.

Police said just after 11pm they received a call from a Germantown resident saying that Catherine Hoggle was spotted walking near Century Rock Boulevard and Crystal Rock Drive.

Officers were dispatched to the area and were able to quickly track down the missing woman, but her two children, 2-year-old Jacob and 3-year-old Sarah, were nowhere to be found.

The woman, who reportedly suffers from paranoid schizophrenia and had gone off her medication, was taken to police headquarters for questioning, wUSA9 reported.

Officers remained on the scene in Germantown overnight, scouring the streets and a nearby apartment complex with K-9 dogs in search of the missing toddlers.

'Thank you to this caller. We remain concerned for the children's welfare and ask that people still call 911 with information and tips,' Montgomery County police tweeted. 

Earlier in the day, authorities released a video showing Hoggle sneaking out the back of a Chick-fil-A in Germantown Monday, just moments after lying to her common-law husband, Troy Turner, about the whereabouts of their two children. 

Hoggle was then captured on video again at the Germantown Commons shopping center on Tuesday morning around 4.30am. The children are not seen in the video.

Getting away: Catherine Hoggle, who has been missing along with her two children since earlier this week, is seen here sneaking out of a restaurant after lying to husband Tory Turner about the location of their children

On the loose: Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Hoggle's two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, (left) and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle (right), who were not with her 

Turner contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing.

The couple had stopped at the fast found restaurant Monday on their way to the police station, as Turner was concerned about the children and felt Hoggle was 'not forthcoming' when he suggested the two go pick them up at daycare.

Moments later, Hoggle went out the back door and walked to the Germantown Transit Center.

'I want it over with, I want my children here with me,' said Turner, who has been distributing and posting  flyers all over town in hopes of finding his wife and children.

Montgomery County police have obtained a warrant for  Hoggle's arrest, charging her with child neglect, a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of 5 years and $5,000, according to ABC 7.

On Sunday, police said Hoggle took the children to her mother's house in Clarksburg.

She said she was  going to take her son Jacob for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later, she did not have him with her.

Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police said Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since.

Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job.

Sarah was last seen on Monday at Hoggle's mother's home.  

Hoggle and Turner also have another son together, whose whereabouts is known.
