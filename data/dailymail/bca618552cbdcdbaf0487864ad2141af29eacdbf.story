Horrific injuries: Mark Laird, 28, was blasted by a shotgun on his back and arm by his friend Murray Gracie, 18. 22 shotgun pellets had to be picked out of his back

A 'shotgun-mad' teenager blasted his friend on his doorstep in an unprovoked attack.

Murray Gracie, 18, shot Mark Laird as the victim’s partner and seven-month old daughter were inside his property in Carluke, Lanarkshire in Scotland.

Gracie then went on to fire at the home of his ex-girlfriend before chasing after terrified police officers with his double barreled shotgun.

His rampage ended after firearms officers followed him to a retail park during an eight-mile pursuit.

Gracie - who was on probation at the time - appeared at the High Court in Glasgow where he admitted to a string of charges including assault and other gun-related offences.

Prosecutor Kath Harper told how, as far back as March 2010, Gracie had spoken about getting hold of a gun and shooting at police.

He later had 'on-going pre-occupying thoughts' of sourcing a firearm.

The court heard how electrician Mr Laird was shot outside his family home on January 8 this year.

Gracie had texted his friend earlier that evening to ask where he was and Mr Laird said he was in his house.

Around 11.20pm, the 28 year-old dad was outside having a cigarette when he heard a car and then saw Gracie walking towards him.

Mr Laird said: 'What’s happening, Murray?' Gracie replied: 'I don’t know - what is happening?'

Mr Laird then spotted the teenager was armed with a sawn off double-barreled shotgun.

He quickly turned back towards his front door before hearing a loud bang and then feeling a searing pain in his body.

Miss Harper said: 'The noise was heard by a number of witnesses in his houses nearby and by Mr Laird’s partner Emma Donnelly who was woken from her sleep.'

Gracie fled in his car while Mr Laird managed to alert his girlfriend that he had been shot.

Police nearby heard the gun blast and arrived to find the injured victim in the hallway of his house.

The dad was rushed to hospital, where a total of 22 shotgun pellets were picked out of his back.

Gracie meantime drove to the nearby home of his ex-partner Laura Donnelly - the sister of Mr Laird’s girlfriend.

The couple had split months earlier after a falling out.

Miss Donnelly had grown fearful of Gracie after he had become 'increasingly obsessive' about her.

Miss Donnelly was going to her bed around midnight on January 8 when she ended up covered in broken glass following another loud bang.

Her family heard her screams before noticing Gracie fleeing the scene.

Police also soon arrived there and spoke to Gracie who had contacted Miss Donnelly’s brother.

One officer asked was he fine and a laughing Gracie replied: 'Mate, I’m listening to f****** (singer) Jack Johnson - do I sound like I am alright?'

The court heard a total of 16 fired pellets were discovered in the hallway.

Around 1am, other officers on the hunt for Gracie spotted him getting out of his car and running at their vehicle with the shotgun.

The constables reversed at speed while Gracie returned to his motor and sped after them.

A firearms unit was alerted to the drama and they followed Gracie until he eventually stopped his car at a retail park in Hamilton, Lanarkshire.

The shotgun was found in his vehicle. Gracie - who was wearing body armour - claimed he would have fired more shots had the barrel of the weapon not been broken.

His family home was later searched and a bullet cartridge was discovered inside a toy car while a similar item was discovered in his bedroom and the garage.

Advocate depute Miss Harper said it was accepted that Gracie’s family were unaware of any gun-related equipment being stored at the property.

The court was told Mr Laird required surgery for injuries that were potentially life-threatening.

Medics said he could have suffered a fatal infection had he not been treated in time.

Gracie admitted to the charges at the high court on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Miss Harper said Gracie had a history of mental illness and that his actions at the time were affected by “an abnormality of mind”.

Judge Lady Stacey imposed an interim compulsion order for the teenager to remain at The State Hospital in Carstairs.

Gracie will return to the dock in December.
