It seems that Spain's favourite style icon has been taking note of the SS14 catwalks.

Queen Letizia, who is yet to make a fashion faux pas, stepped out for today's royal engagement embracing the season's hottest colours: yellow and white.

The Spanish monarch looked chic and stylish as she and husband King Felipe delivered scholarships at Iberdrola Foundation at Casa America in Madrid.

Showing a glimpse of a fashion wild side, the 41-year-old accessorised with snakeskin stilettos - a design she's been favouring in recent weeks.

The all-white look is here to stay if 3.1 Phillip Lim and Prabal Gurung's offerings were anything to go by this season. The look has been updated with clever tailoring, clean silhouettes and feminine accents to give it the most minimal effect and the Queen of Spain seems to have nailed the look.

Happy to be here! While she and her husband have been attending events nearly every day since coming to the throne, they didn't show any signs of fatigue

Adding a pop of colour to her outfit, she teamed her smart blazer with colourful yellow trousers.

The bright canary hue was the colour du jour at fashion week and whether it was sherbet, buttercup or lemon, it couldn't be missed.

It's already been a busy week for the newly appointed Queen, just yesterday she and her husband were on a visit to the Spanish Design and Innovation Awards in Valladolid.

On Tuesday, the pair met the Pope. King
 Felipe VI and Queen Letizia, wearing white as is standard protocol for a
 queen visiting the pope, were greeted by Francis in the papal library.

Teamwork: The royal couple, who work very closely together, glanced over some documents at the event in Madrid

Radiant: She may be 41 but the Queen shows no signs of her age and looked fresh and radiant on her engagement today

Last week Queen Letizia flaunted a new hairstyle, which gave the appearance of a
 swish bob, at the Prince of Girona Awards ceremony held at the Palacio
 de Congresos of Girona in Catalonia.

It wasn't clear whether the glamorous Royal had gone for the chop and cut 
off her luscious locks - or whether she was fooling us with clever 
styling, and had simply twisted her flowing hair under, and pinned it.

Today and yesterday's appearances proves that it was just a nifty stylist trick as she 
showcased her usual flowing caramel hair on a visit to meet Pope Francis
 at the Vatican.

Francis
 had met Felipe's parents, King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia, on several 
occasions, the last time during the April 27 canonizations of Saints 
John Paul II and John XXIII. Juan Carlos abdicated earlier this month.

It
 has been a busy few weeks for the 41-year-old. Since becoming Queen she
 has attended numerous public events. She showcased her good taste once 
again last week as she joined 
her husband to attend an audience with the Social Solidarity Association
at El Pardo Palace in Madrid. 

For that occasion, she wore tailored navy trousers and a tweed blue jacket.

Letizia Ortiz, from Asturias in the north
west of Spain, married Prince Felipe de Borbon ten years ago at 
Cathedral Santa María la Real de la Almudena in Madrid.

The
couple began their relationship in November 2002 when they encountered 
one another while she was on assignment, covering a story about an oil 
spillage in Northern Spain. Felipe – who had met Letizia before at a 
dinner party – was there representing the Spanish royal family, and the 
two started a romantic relationship.

Letizia shops at the supermarket and champions Spanish high street 
fashion brands such as Zara and Mango, as well as couturiers such as Felipe Varela and Lorenzo Caprile.

She regularly tops best-dressed lists in her own country and worldwide.
