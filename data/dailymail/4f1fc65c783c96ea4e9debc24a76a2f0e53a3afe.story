Intimate details of the affair between a married MP and his blonde Russian researcher were exposed last night as she was cleared of spying for Moscow.

In her diary, Ekaterina Zatuliveter, then 20, described her love for 'her darling Teddy Bear' Mike Hancock, who is 40 years her senior.

She wrote of her desire to feel him 'with all my naked body', and nicknamed the Liberal Democrat her 'King Louis', thought to be a reference to the ape from Disney's The Jungle Book.

Success: Miss Zatuliveter, 26, smiles with flowers outside the Immigration 
Commission hearing today where she won her case against deportation

Details from the diary proved crucial 
in convincing the tribunal that she was not a honeytrap sent to access 
defence secrets while working in the Portsmouth MP's Parliamentary 
office, as MI5 claimed.

The Special Immigration Appeals 
Commission described the diary as 'compelling' evidence of her innocence
and concluded the pair's four-year liaison was 'enduring and genuine on
both sides'.

The panel said: 'However odd it might seem, she fell for him.'

Appeal: Katia Zatuliveter told a hearing her affair with MP Mike Hancock was based on love, not espionage

Last night Miss Zatuliveter admitted 
she was 'surprised' to win her case and accused the security services of
being 'unprofessional and paranoid'.

She added: 'I went through an 
extremely unfair process. If I can describe it in war terms it would be 
me on a horse with a sword against tanks and aircraft.'

And she confessed she felt she had no choice but to reveal intimate details of her private life to prove she wasn't a spy.

She said: 'I had two options. I would 
be forever branded a spy, but will be  able to keep my private life 
private; or I had to give all of this out to the press and to the public
but be able to prove that I am not spy.

'And for me, it was more important to prove that I am not a spy.'

The former international relations 
student was arrested last year as the Government sought to deport her to
Russia, claiming her presence was a threat to national security.

The 26-year-old, known as Katia, was 
accused of seducing Mr Hancock, who has been married to his wife 
Jacqueline for more than 40 years.  

Government lawyers pointed to a string
of affairs she had with older men in sensitive positions, including a 
Nato official and a Dutch diplomat.

The journal emerged at the start of 
the tribunal – despite Miss Zatuliveter's claim in her first witness 
statement that she had never kept a diary.

It purported to cover a period from November 2004 to April 2007, including the start of the affair with Mr Hancock in 2006. 

She wrote of clashes with her sister Polina who told her she was 'wasting her youth on an older man'.

The panel said the diary showed Miss 
Zatuliveter to be an 'immature, calculating, emotional and self-centred 
young woman'. In it she describes four men she wishes to date as 
potential 'victims'.

In April 2006, she wrote: 'Mike Hancock, MP wants both to help me and to sleep with me.

True love: Miss Zatuliveter, 26, wrote in 
her diary like a 'love-struck teenager' after meeting 65-year-old 
Liberal MP Mike Hancock, right, at a conference in St Petersburg in 
2006, the hearing heard

'He offered me to go with him to Strasbourg at the end of June. I said yes. Is there any danger in it?'

Then in June, after the affair began, she wrote: 'I am in love... And he's gone to Iraq today.

'I worry a lot, don't know what to do,
what to do with myself. Yes, he had told me that most probably he won't
be able to either call or to write me.

'I wish there were at least some news. I stay at home all day. What if he calls me? My darling Teddy Bear.

'I so want to see you, to feel you 
with all my naked body. Let the moment of our next meeting come the 
soonest possible. I love you, my King Louis!'

The tribunal said the entry about Iraq
was a 'revealingly false statement'. While Miss Zatuliveter thought Mr 
Hancock was in Iraq on a committee visit, he was actually in Paris. The 
panel, chaired by Mr Justice Mitting, accepted this could be a 
'subsequent fabrication' but concluded Mr Hancock had lied to her.

Their ruling states: 'The picture 
painted by the diary entries is inconsistent with the Security Service's
assessment that she was, most likely, tasked actively to pursue the 
offer of a relationship with Mr Hancock.

'The most likely explanation, and one 
which we find to be proved on the balance of probabilities, is that, 
however odd it might seem, she fell for him.'

Last night security officials insisted
they were not in any way 'embarrassed' by the ruling and insisted their
identification of Miss Zatuliveter as a potential threat to national 
security was correct.

The ruling said: 'We are satisfied that it is significantly more likely than not that she was and is not a Russian agent.' 

However, it added: 'We cannot exclude 
the possibility that we have been gulled – but, if we have been, it has 
been by a supremely competent and rigorously trained operative.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'The 
court ruled that there were ample grounds for suspicion. We are 
therefore very disappointed by the court's judgment.'
