Millionaire homeowners at the exclusive Sandbanks resort say rowdy stag and hen parties renting luxury mansions are making their lives a 'misery'.

Angry residents launched a campaign after several multi-million pounds holiday homes in the exclusive beach-side destination in Dorset became popular as weekend 'party houses'.

Some of the properties were being rented out for up to £1,000 a night - and because they are so big, groups of up to 30 partygoers were staying in them for nights out in nearby Bournemouth.

Residents in neighbouring properties said they were regularly having to endure noise from all-night parties while some reported having to ask revellers to remove sex dolls tied to their verandas.

But that could all be set to change after a court ruling that could see landlords and letting agents fined up to £20,000 if they allow guests to run riot at their properties.

In the first decision of its kind, a judge upheld a noise abatement notice handed to letting agent Michele King following a string of complaints about a property managed by her Deluxe Holiday Homes business.

Mrs King appealed the notice handed to her from Poole council, arguing she could not be held responsible for the noise coming from the property as she was not the one staying there.

But District Judge Stephen Nicholls dismissed the appeal, stating that Mrs King should be accountable for the disturbances.

The ruling means landlords and lettings agents will now be held accountable should complaints be made about groups staying in their houses, and could be liable for fines of up to £20,000 if they flout noise abatement orders in future.

Residents declared the judge's decision 'a significant victory' but warned it only protects them against large groups making excessive noise

Residents declared the decision 'a significant victory' but warned it only protects them against large groups making excessive noise.

Steve Cameron, a 55-year-old IT consultant, formed the Party House Action Group with his wife Jen after the property next door to theirs became a party house.

He said: 'We have been fighting this ever since the first noise abatement order was issued on a party house three years ago.

'Living next door to one has been sheer misery for us and our neighbours.

'From spring through to autumn each year we have been unable to sleep with our windows open and we have been constantly woken up in the early hours by large groups coming back from nights out.

'While this ruling is not the complete answer it's a step in the right direction because it means letting agents and landlords who specialise in short-term rentals can now be held accountable for the behaviour of their guests.

'They face a £20,000 fine for flouting the noise abatement order so hopefully that will be enough to encourage them to take responsibility for what goes on at their properties.

'What it doesn't do is prevent these houses being rented out to huge groups of people in the first place, it only stops them from making noise deemed excessive.

'It also takes a long time to go through the application process to get a noise abatement order.'

Terry Stewart, president of the Branksome Park, Canford Cliffs and District Residents' Association, added: 'We are very glad of the court's ruling.

'Neighbours of the party houses have really suffered over the last three years.'

Cllr Xena Dion, a spokesman for environmental health at Poole council, said: 'We are truly pleased with this decision. The council takes the issue of noise disturbance very seriously as it is extremely distressing for neighbours. 

'This case has caused a huge amount of distress to local residents and officers have dedicated a significant amount of effort to resolve it. 

'The court's verdict means we can now continue using this legislation to tackle any similar incidents in the future.'

Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of its property

Located on a small peninsula stretching across the mouth of Poole Harbour in Dorset, Sandbanks is known for both its picturesque beach and the high value of property.

By area Sandbanks and surrounding Lilliput, Branksome Park and Canford Cliffs, nicknamed 'Britain's Palm Beach', boast the fourth highest land value in the world and the UK's largest concentration of expensive properties outside London.

Sandbanks' popularity is attributed to its seclusion, and every home in the community is within just a few minutes' walk of the beach, with most of them enjoying stunning views over the harbour or out to the English Channel.

Houses were first built on Sandbanks in the late 19th century, but it was not until the 1960s when a property boom saw the peninsula - measuring less than half a square mile - become more and more built-up, turning into a Millionaires' Row filled with luxury beachfront mansions.

The property market on the peninsula has shot through the roof in the past few years, with many houses being demolished and replaced with cutting-edge new properties to meet demand.

In July 2009 a 1,393-square-metre (14,990 sq ft) empty plot of land on the peninsula was put up for sale for £13.5 million – the equivalent of nearly £10,000 per square metre.

Earlier this year a bungalow bought for just £1,000 almost a century ago (around £40,000 in today's money) and now a luxury holiday home was reported to be worth £5million - a 500,000 percent increase in value.

In April, a tatty 1950s three-bedroom Sandbanks bungalow which would be worth just £200,000 in most other parts of the country went on sale for an eye-watering £2.25million.

In March, an empty plot on the exclusive enclave went on sale for £3million - double what it had sold for before its old bungalow was knocked down.

Last year, 15 homes were sold for a combined total of £80million as Sandbanks' s reputation has continued to grow.

Notable residents include a number of well-known names in football such as Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis, former player and manager Graeme Souness, Queen's Park Rangers manager Harry Redknapp and his son Jamie. Computer magnate Sir Peter Ogden is also said to have a home there.

The five-bedroom house she was given the noise abatement notice for is advertised on her website under the heading 'live the Sandbanks dream' and says it sleeps up to 20 people over three floors.

Her website also offers to organise stag and hen dos and provide naked butlers for those staying at her houses. Mrs King declined to comment after her appeal was dismissed.

Houses in Sandbanks, a tiny sandy peninsula at the mouth of Poole Harbour, can sell for as much as £10million.

Two football managers own property in the Sandbanks area - QPR boss Harry Redknapp, who owns a harbour-front mansion, and former Crystal Palace manager Tony Pulis.

Graeme Souness, the ex-Liverpool player and manager and now Sky TV pundit, has a home in nearby Branksome Park as does former Tottenham player Darren Anderton.

Up until recently, cricket legend Geoffrey Boycott owned a house on Sandbanks.
