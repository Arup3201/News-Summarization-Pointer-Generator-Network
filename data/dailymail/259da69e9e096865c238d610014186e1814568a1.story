Anti-royalist: Sam Bracanov,74, was arrested

A 74-year-old anti-royalist protester was arrested moments before Prince Charles and Camilla arrived to greet thousands of people as part of their New Zealand tour.

The pensioner was named by One News as Sam Bracanov and they reported he was arrested after he was allegedly captured on CCTV in downtown Auckland preparing to commit an assault.

Bracanov has admitted planning to throw a bucket of horse manure over the Prince and Camila.

'I was going to mix it with water, stir it around and make it easy to throw and then throw it at them,' he said.

'Royalty smells, so what difference does it make if I hit them?'

But if he tries anything like it again he will go straight to jail for disobeying a magistrate's order to stay at least 500 yards from the royal couple.

When Charles and Camilla arrived they made their way along the crowds shaking hands and a small group of protesters could be seen holding up placards.

One read 'Get a Job Royal Bludgers' - New Zealand slang for someone who avoids work.

A statement on the New Zealand Police
website said the man from the Mangere suburb of Auckland was arrested 
at 12.40pm - around 50 minutes before the royal couple arrived.

It added: 'Arresting officers had identified 
the man as a known anti-royalist who was, when arrested, at a royal 
itinerary venue although neither of the royal visitors was in the 
vicinity at the time.'

Royal encounter: Prince Charles meets Dame Kiri Te Kanawa at a Diamond Jubilee Trust reception in Auckland during the last leg of their tour marking Queen Elizabeth II's diamond jubilee

Close enough: The pair have a slightly awkward peck on the cheek at the reception

The Prince and Duchess are on a seven-day Diamond Jubilee tour of New Zealand.

Meanwhile Prince Charles had some 
close encounters during the final stop on his and the Duchess of 
Cornwall's Diamond Jubilee Tour.

The Royal couple are on the last leg 
of their tour visiting New Zealand where The Prince of Wales broke 
protocol by hugging a rugby player.

However
later the same evening Charles behaved with royal grace and kept his 
distance as he greeted Dame Kiri Te Kanawa at a reception and dinner for
the Diamond Jubilee Trust in Auckland.

Earlier today the Prince of Wales had a much closer encounter with a female rugby player during a visit to New Zealand's national training center for high performance sports, in Auckland.

Upon meeting Charles, Linda Itunu ignored protocol and took an unconventional approach to the standard handshake and curtsey and hugged the Prince.

The 27-year-old sportswoman was delighted when Charles hugged her back but had to help him wipe his forehead once they let go and apologised 
to the royal for leaving him a little damp.

As Camilla chatted to Olympic medallists 
Charles headed over to the women’s rugby sevens team and held out his 
hand to Ms Itunu but got a hug instead.

The sportswoman, who is a prop in the New Zealand women’s rugby sevens team, said: “I just saw him and he looked like he needed a hug.

'I said to the Prince, "Can I give you a hug" and he said he didn’t mind.'

Before Charles left the rugby player said she issued an ultimatum to the royal: 'I told him he better be supporting us - not England.'

As Charles walked away he joked with the women telling them: 'If you don’t win I shall be very disappointed.'

The
royal couple toured the sporting complex where the local community and 
top athletes alike have access world-class facilities, training and 
healthcare services.

Charles
and Camilla also tried their hand at netball when they met some of New 
Zealand’s top women players who towered over the royals.

They
both hit the rim a number of times as they tried in vain to score a 
goal and netball player Maria Tutaia, 25, who is 6ft 2ins tall, joked: 
'Let’s just say he’s pretty good with a crown on his head but his 
shooting needs some work. But it was good he had a go and nice to see 
him speak to all the athletes as he went round.'

After their workout the Royal pair met
well-wishers in Auckland city centre where huge crowds had gathered 
despite and despite the torrential rain which started soon after the 
royals appeared.

The hugging
theme continued when the Prince came across a person in fancy dress 
wolf costume, arms open wide for a hug, but Charles simply laughed and 
walked on.

As the royals 
made their way along the crowds shaking hands a small group of 
protesters held up placards, one read 'Get a Job Royal Bludgers' - New 
Zealand slang for someone who avoids work.

Charles later wielded a handheld rug 
making machine as he learned about a special project to create a wool 
rug featuring his coat-of-arms.

He
was handed the tufting machine that resembled an electric drill by Sam 
Maloney, 30, who has been contracted to make the textile artwork.

The
half-completed coat-of-arms rug was hung from a large frame and just 
outside the border of the piece Charles tried sowing tufts of wool into a
thread mesh.

The Prince 
joked with Mr Maloney and said 'I’ll write my name', but his first 
attempt left a tangled mass of wool but he soon perfected the technique 
and wove a couple of straight lines.

Charles’
efforts came as he toured an exhibition showcasing a diverse range of 
wool products in his role as patron and founder of the Campaign for 
Wool, a project launched in 2010.

In a speech Charles joked: 'I don’t know if you also realise according to GQ magazine I am a fashion icon.'

In an article written for
the December issue of GQ Australia, he admits it’s funny to be back in 
fashion at his age, but said it seems to happen every 25 years.

He
also unveiled that he does not make an effort to keep up with new 
styles, but waits for it to come around and catch up with him again 
after 
every two decades or so.

But he added that one commentator had
recently called him ‘beyond fashion’, which added to his confusion. ‘I 
am still not sure if he she meant it as a compliment.'

‘Clothes have to combine style with 
sustainability and I find good tailoring more than meets that challenge,
much to the amusement of my staff who are sometimes surprised to find 
that what I’m wearing turns out to be as old as or even older than they 
are.’

In the GQ piece the Prince laments about being listed on both
the Best Dressed and Worst Dressed lists over the years, but reveals 
that it’s his body shape more than anything which dictates his style.

‘I simply had to go my own way and stick to what I felt suited me,’ he writes.

‘As that happens to involve what many
once considered to be old-fashioned double breasted suits, I can only 
expect to be considered unfashionable.’

In today's speech he referred to his double breasted suit made from New Zealand wool saying: 'I am a walking demonstration of the ability of New Zealand wool to disguise a rapidly disintegrating and ageing body.'
