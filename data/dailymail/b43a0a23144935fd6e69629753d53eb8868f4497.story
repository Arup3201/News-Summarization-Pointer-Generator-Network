He can trace his ancestry back to the Duke of Wellington, has a handsome trust fund and owns a portfolio of properties.

She has far humbler origins, eight children from a disastrous marriage, and is ten years his senior.

But Richard Wellesley, a great-great-great-great nephew of the famous Iron Duke, and Paula Carton became unlikely lovers, had two children – the first when he was 17 – and set up home together.

Paula Carton cheated the taxpayer of more than £100,000 in housing benefits while living with Richard Wellesley, a descendant of the Duke of Wellington

Despite all that aristocratic Mr Wellesley had to offer, however, troubled Carton still fiddled more than £100,000 in benefits.

Posing as a single mother, she claimed £107,705 in housing benefits and 
income support over ten years while they shared a £250,000 detached 
Victorian house bought for them by his mother.

Her fraud and their surprising relationship were laid bare in court when
Carton, 49, was spared jail as Mr Wellesley, 39, promised a judge he 
would pay back every penny she had cheated from the taxpayer.

Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, set up a trust fund for his descendants including Richard Wellesley, his brother's great-great-great grandson

He receives £38,400 a year from trust funds set up for descendants of 
Arthur Wellesley, the original Duke of Wellington, who became a hero 
after defeating Napoleon in the Battle of Waterloo in 1815.

Mr 
Wellesley’s great-great-great grandfather was a brother of the duke.

The court heard Mr Wellesley plans to use an advance on the funds held 
by Coutts, the Queen’s bankers, to make the repayment.

Carton, who 
appeared at Cardiff Crown Court walking with the aid of a crutch, had 
pretended Mr Wellesley was her landlord and she paid rent to him.

Council investigators became suspicious because utility and Sky TV 
subscription bills were in his name at their address in the village of 
Abersychan, near Pontypool, South Wales.

Gareth James, prosecuting, said: ‘After she was investigated by fraud 
officers she admitted, “He is a little more than a landlord”.’

He added that she would not have been entitled to any of the money 
because of Mr Wellesley’s lineage and wealth. The court heard Carton had
a difficult life after being abandoned by her mother to be brought up 
in an Irish convent.

At 16 she married a man of 49 with whom she had an 
abusive relationship, eight children and two miscarriages.

She formed a relationship with Mr Wellesley when she was living on a 
farm in Ireland owned by his mother. In 1995, Mr Wellesley began to 
study at Aberystwyth University and she and her children followed him to
Wales.

She went on to receive income support of £54,817 and housing 
benefit of £52,888 by claiming she was a ‘lone parent living with ten 
children’.

Carton had pretended Mr Wellesley was her landlord of the big property, pictured, and she paid rent to him

Andrew Gregg, defending, said: ‘She found it difficult to define her 
relationship with Mr Wellesley and that is why she began claiming these 
benefits.’

Carton has ‘physical conditions and depression’ and is awaiting an operation on her back, he added.

After leaving university Mr Wellesley earned meagre wages working at a 
builders’ merchant and did not receive money from the trust funds until 
the death of his mother three years ago, Mr Gregg said. Carton, whose 
children are aged between 32 and 19, admitted four charges of benefit 
fraud.

The court heard Mr Wellesley owns at least three houses, taking 
£1,800-a-month rent from one property in Bristol.

He is paid £700 a 
month from one trust fund and £7,500 a quarter from another.

He gave an undertaking under oath from the witness box that the cash 
advance on his trust fund would be used to repay taxpayers.

He and 
Carton will appear at the same court on Friday when the judge could jail
her if the money has not been repaid.
