Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is today labelled as a problem in society, with diagnoses surging by as much as tenfold in some countries.

But it may not have always been considered as something that needs treating. In fact, one scientist claims ADHD may have helped the human species survive.

New York-based Professor Richard Friedman argues that nomads who were adventurous, hyperactive and impulsive were more likely to survive in their harsh surroundings.

These traits are similar to ones associated with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), a condition that affects around five per cent of the population.

'Having the profile of what we now call ADHD would have made you a Paleolithic success story,' Weill Cornell Medical College psychiatry Professor Richard Friedman wrote in the New York Times.

Scientific studies seem to back up this theory. Professor Friedman points to a study conducted several years ago on the Ariaal tribe in Kenya.

The research, led by of Northwestern University, analysed part of the tribe that had settled into an agricultural community. The rest of the tribe remained nomadic.

The tribesmen were tested for DRD4 7R, a genetic variant that the study said, 'has been linked to greater food and drug cravings, novelty-seeking, and ADHD symptoms.'

Those tribesmen who had the ADHD-linked gene variant tended to be better nourished. However, in the settled group, people with DRD4 7R were underweight, reported Business Insider.

The study suggests certain characteristics linked with ADHD may have helped some people survive under conditions similar to those experienced by early nomads.

'Nomadic Ariaal, with short attention spans and novelty-seeking tendencies, are probably going to have an easier time making the most of a dynamic environment, including getting more to eat,' wrote Professor Friedman.

'This same brief attention span would not be very useful among the settled, who have to focus on activities that call for sustained focus, like going to school, growing crops and selling goods.'

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a group of behavioural symptoms that include inattentiveness, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. 

ADHD can occur in people of any intellectual ability, although it is more common in people with learning difficulties. 

People with ADHD may also have additional problems, such as sleep and anxiety disorders.

Symptoms of ADHD tend to be first noticed at an early age, and may become more noticeable when a child's circumstances change, such as when they start school.

Most cases are diagnosed in children between the ages of 6 and 12.

The symptoms of ADHD usually improve with age, but many adults who are diagnosed with the condition at a young age will continue to experience problems.

Around three to seven per cent of children, or 400,000, are believed to have ADHD in the UK, with many being prescribed drugs to try and improve their concentration at school.

In the US, around five per cent of children are thought to have ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD in US adult is at around three to five per cent.

Professor Friedman says the lower value society places on ADHD traits may account for why more children are being diagnosed with the condition each year.

'Digital life, with its vivid gaming and exciting social media, is a world of immediate gratification where practically any desire or fantasy can be realised in the blink of an eye,' said Professor Friedman.

'By comparison, school would seem even duller to a novelty-seeking kid living in the early 21st century than in previous decades.

'The comparatively boring school environment might accentuate students' inattentive behaviour, making their teachers more likely to see it and driving up the number of diagnoses.'

There remains controversy surrounding the condition. Last week, experts said the global surge in ADHD diagnosis has more to do with marketing than medicine.

Diagnosis rates and prescriptions of stimulant drugs are soaring compared with five years ago. 

However, Professor Peter Conrad, of Brandeis University claims ADHD is 'more of an economic and cultural plague than a medical one'.
