Aston Villa have offered teenage sensation Jack Grealish a new four-year deal at the club.

The 19-year-old has attracted interest from Chelsea and is in the final 12 months of his current contract at Villa Park.

Grealish was handed his first-team debut at the end of last season against Manchester City after impressing on loan at League One outfit Notts County, where he featured 38 times.

Rising star: Villa are keen to tie Grealish to a new long-term deal

The winger has forced his way into Paul Lambert's first-team plans and featured as a substitute in the Premier League wins against Stoke and Hull City.

Grealish has also represented the Republic of Ireland at Under 21 level and his representatives recently held talks with Martin O'Neill about his international future.

The Bodymoor Heath academy graduate has been with the club since the age of six and Villa are keen to tie down his long-term future.
