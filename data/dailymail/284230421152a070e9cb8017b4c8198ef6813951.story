Swansea City manager Garry Monk has insisted there were no internal issues with the Spanish contingent that has been broken up this summer.

Michu has joined Napoli on loan, while the transfers of Chico Flores and Pablo Hernandez to Qatar were completed on Thursday. Jose Canas is also set to leave the club after being told he is surplus to requirements.

Monk said: 'I spoke to Pablo and had good discussions with him. It comes down to the player himself. I wanted him to be here, but he was in the last year of his contract. He had a longer term offer from abroad and it was what he felt the right decision for him and his family.

No issues: Swansea manager Garry Monk has said there were no internal problems with the contingent of Spanish players that are leaving the club this summer 

Loan move: Striker Michu has been sent on a season-long loan to Italian side Napoli 

New challenge: Chico Flores has left to join Qatar side Lekhwiya, who are managed by former Swans boss Michael Laudrup

'Michu, Chico, Pablo were all in the same situation. They wanted new challenges and I wasn’t going to step in the way because I only want players who want to be at Swansea.

'I spoke to all of three. They are quality players and were part of my plans. But this happens many times at all clubs. You try to show their future can be here. 

'Sometimes for different reasons players want something else. Pablo wanted security of three or four years that we couldn’t offer. That made his mind up. Michu felt he needed a new challenge after last season. I wanted all three to stay.

'I don’t care what nationality people are, for me it’s all about the football.'

Middle East move: Pablo Hernandez has joined Qatar side Al-Arabi 

Almost done: Swansea are close to sealing a deal for Argentina defender Federico Fernandez 

Monk also confirmed that Napoli defender Federico Fernandez is on the verge of joining Swansea for a fee of more than £7m.

He said: 'We have had good chats with Fernandez. Fees have been agreed with the clubs and hopefully he’ll be here for medicals this week. Not in time for Saturday (against Manchester United), though. 

'He brings that pedigree of playing for Napoli and Argentina. He is at a good age for us and will suit Swansea City. We want players who add quality to the squad and he will.'

Monk added: 'Two or three more players would be nice.'

Strikeforce: Bafetimbi Gomis and Wilfried Bony train for Swansea before their Premier League opener

Captain: Swansea captain Ashley Williams has lost his centre-back partner, Chico, who has moved to Qatar

Depleted: Swansea have lost Chico, Ben Davies and Michel Vorm from their defence this summer

Lineup: It is not yet clear whether Gomis and Bony will play together in attack, or if Bony will play alone

Tactics: Gary Monk will have his work cut out this weekend when he faces Manchester United

Stretch: Swansea players do their stretches during preparation for Saturday's match

Signings: Gary Monk has brought in six new player this summer, including former Swan Gylfi Sigurdsson
