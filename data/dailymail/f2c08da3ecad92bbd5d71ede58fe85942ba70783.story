Cheeky: Lulu, a new women-only mobile app that allows users to anonymously rate their male Facebook friends, is being sued in Brazil

A 28-year-old Brazilian man is suing the creators of an app which allows women to anonymously rate men.

Lulu was launched in Brazil just two weeks ago and has already overtaken WhatsApp and Facebook to become the country's most-downloaded app.

Its women-only network piggybacks on Facebook to allow users to rate their male friends on their character, appearance and sexual performance.

But Felippo de Almeida Scolari, 28, from São Paulo, was 'disgusted' after he learned his profile had been reviewed with comments including '#Doesn'tCallTheNextDay', '#ShouldComeWithAWarning' and '#CheaperThanBreadandButter'.

After finding out he scored 7.7 out of 10 on app, he has decided to sue its creators, claiming that allowing anonymous and disparaging comments about a person is unconstitutional under Brazilian law.

Mr Scolari told The Telegraph: 'I was disgusted because I didn't authorise my details to be used by this app. I have a girlfriend and she learned about it because a mutual friend sent it to us.

'She was annoyed because she didn't like seeing this kind of thing written about me.'

Available as a mobile app for Android and iPhone, Lulu describes itself as 'a private network for girls to express and share their opinions openly and honestly'.

It syncs with users' Facebook profiles to allow them to anonymously rate the sense of humour, manners, ambition, commitment level and appearance of their male friends on the social network by answering multiple-choice questions.

'We created Lulu to unleash the value of girl talk and to empower girls to make smarter decisions on topics ranging from relationships to beauty and health,' its creators boast on the app's website.

But Mr Scolari, who is a legal academic, feels differently about the software. 'It's a question of privacy on the internet,' he sad. 'I want to see the app no longer allowing people to comment anonymously and Facebook no longer giving personal details to any app.'

Some Brazilian commentators have likened Lulu to mere bar gossip, a comparison rubbished by Mr Scolari in a statement he released to journalists.

'A conversation in a bar is to Lulu as a bottle of water is to the ocean,' he said, adding that the app's impact must be seen in terms of 'undue exposure, range and potential harm.'

Mr Scolari's case is set to go to court on March 26. He is suing the company behind Lulu for R$27,120 (£7,000) in damages, which he says he will donate to a support group for children with cancer.

A spokeswoman for Lulu said: 'We are aware of this lawsuit and that the judge said he would not grant an injunction because there is an automatic tool that men can use to remove themselves from Lulu.  It is available at company.onlulu.com/deactivate.

'The tool allows guys to ensure that they do not appear on the Lulu app and blocks them from being reviewed by their female friends. Interestingly, one-third of guys who use the removal tool reactivate themselves within a week.

'The Lulu app is not available in the UK or Europe but we receive requests daily from women who want to be able to use Lulu, like the millions of women elsewhere.'

Lulu's chairman, Alexandra Chong, denied that the app violated Brazilian law.

'We designed the Lulu in order to comply with local laws in the United States and Brazil, and we have an excellent team of lawyers and consultants. I'm not aware of any case in Brazil,' she told Brazilian magazine Epoca.
