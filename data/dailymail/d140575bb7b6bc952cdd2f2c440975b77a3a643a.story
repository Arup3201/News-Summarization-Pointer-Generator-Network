Tottenham Hotspur took to the training ground ahead of Thursday night's Europa League Group C clash with Greek outfit Asteras Tripolis.

Mauricio Pochettino's men continued their preparations for matchday three of the competition at Tottenham's Training Centre complex in Enfield.

Amid rumours Belgian defender Jan Vertonghen could  move away from the London club, Pochettino claimed the subject has never been discussed between the pair.

'(Hearing) rumours and information and different situations... for me it’s easy I don’t read ever', the Argentine said.

'I know the players are affected and they call me about the rumours, but Jan is a very important player for Tottenham and for me.'

On the possibility of the Belgian starting against Asteras on Thursday, Pochettino was honest: 'Kaboul and Fazio worked very hard here and are fresh and I give them the opportunity to play, but I haven’t changed my view on Jan. He is a very good player and a key player for us.'

But with rumours surrounding Vertonghen's future at White Hart Lane the Spurs boss remained confident. 'He has four years on his contract. It’s a very long contract and he is happy inside. We have a very good relationship', he said.

'I never hear from Jan he wants to leave or change something. After (all) it is impossible to trust in other people than him because for me it is impossible when we have a chat inside my office. Jan never told me he wants to leave.

Harry Kane has been vital for Tottenham's Europa League campaign, scoring in qualifying against AEL Limassol and again versus Besiktas

'I have trust in my player and Jan never told me about that. He is happy at Tottenham. Maybe sometimes he wants to play more but my decision is to take a decision. He is happy and I’m happy with him.'

Spurs go into the game against Asteras at White Hart Lane after a demoralising 4-1 defeat to Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday, despite some promising spells against the Premier League champions.

Spurs have been equally underwhelming in Europe this season. They could only manage  a goalless draw at Partizan Belgrade in their opening Europa League match, and then dropped a further two points after a Demba Ba penalty saw them draw with Besiktas  earlier this month.

Algeria midfielder Bentaleb picked up an ankle niggle on international duty, which ruled him out of the trip to Manchester City. Right back Walker remains absent after abdominal surgery while fellow full back Naughton is sidelined with an ankle injury.

The north London side's return to Europa League action kicks off a gruelling three games in six days at White Hart Lane, with Spurs hosting Newcastle United in the Premier League on Sunday and Brighton & Hove Albion in the League Cup next Wednesday.
