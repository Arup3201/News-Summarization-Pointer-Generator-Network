David Cameron is now less popular with voters than the Tory party, a new poll shows for the first time.

There has been a ‘noticeable shift’ against the Prime Minister in recent months, according to polling by former Conservative donor Lord Ashcroft.

The Tory party has also been damaged by recent rows over gay marriage and Europe, with only one in four voters now believing Mr Cameron’s party is united.

Popularity: Voters are now feel more favourable towards the Tories than David Cameron personally, reversing a long-term trend that saw the Prime Minister outpoll his party

Months of Tory in-fighting has hit the party’s reputation with voters while also tarnishing Mr Cameron’s own standing.

Strategists had argued that the Prime Minister was more popular with the public than the Conservative party as a whole.

It was seen as a key rebuttal to those in the Tory party who calling for a change in direction or even a change in leader.

But
 the polling shows that 22 per cent of those questioned said they were 
more favourably disposed towards the Conservative Party as a whole while
 only 18 per cent were more positive about Mr Cameron.

Lord Ashcroft said it was the first 
time this had happened in his polling. He blamed the Tory setbacks on 
the party putting people off by ‘talking amongst ourselves’ about 
peripheral issues like Europe and gay marriage rather than focusing on 
voters' core priorities.

He
 issued a warning to the party's leadership that there was ‘no time to 
waste’, and said it was vital for Chancellor George Osborne's spending 
review later this month to show that Tories are doing what the public 
want from them.

In 
particular the Tories have lost ground on key issues like crime, 
immigration, welfare reform and the economy over the early months of 
this year.

Overall, 37 per 
cent of those questioned said they would vote Labour, 27 per cent 
Conservative, 15 per cent the UK Independence Party and 9 per cent 
Liberal Democrat.

Switch: Voters are now more favourable towards the Tory party generally than David Cameron, polling by Lord Ashcroft shows although the Labour party received the best reaction

Words: Pollsters asked were asked which words they most associated with the three party leaders here

It gives Ed Miliband's party a comfortable 10-point lead, but Lord Ashcroft noted that this was ‘not much of a score for an opposition party expecting to sweep to power in 23 months' time’.

Mr Miliband was hugely out-polled by the Labour party, by 38 per cent to just 10 per cent.

A majority still said they would prefer to have Mr Cameron than Mr Miliband in Downing Street, and the Prime Minister and Chancellor retained their lead over Mr Miliband and Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls as the best team to manage the economy.

A Labour candidate in a key target seat has criticised the party's leadership.

Sharon Taylor, hoping to over-turn a 3,500 Tory majority in Stevenage, complained that under Tony Blair in 1997 the party was able to capture 'a very broad electorate'.

Speaking at a meeting of the Blairite think tank Progress, she said the party had to do more to explain what it would do in government.

'We’ve got to both oppose and 
propose an alternative.'

The leader of Stevenage Council also questioned the party's economic strategy with shadow chancellor Ed Balls.

She added: 'We’ve let the Tories and others get away with blaming Labour for the economic crisis, and we urgently need to counter that.'

The Government's lead over Labour on the economy widened by several points if Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was named in the question as one of a three-man team alongside Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne.

Writing on the ConservativeHome website, Lord Ashcroft said: ‘The Prime Minister's Europe speech (in January) was supposed to clear the decks and allow us to talk about the things we were elected to do. So much for all that.

‘My poll shows the last six months to have been a missed opportunity to make progress on all the things that will determine who wins in 2015... This is the price we have paid for spending half a year talking amongst ourselves.’

For the Tories, the first half of the year was ‘a time of stagnation that we could hardly afford’, said the Tory peer, adding: ‘The spending review later this month makes it all the more necessary to show we are doing what people expect of us. There is no more time to waste.’

Voters were asked whicvh words and phrases they associated with the three party leaders.

Mr Cameron was branded 'out of touch' but also a leader who 'stands up for Britain'.

Mr Miliband is seen predominantly as 'weak' and 'out of his depth', while Mr Clegg is 'weak', 'out of his depth', and 'out of touch'.

The poll found that only 28 per cent of voters see the Conservatives as ‘united’, against 48 per cent for Labour.

Some 38 per cent trusted Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne to manage the economy, compared with 33 per cent for Ed Miliband and Ed Balls.

But 40 per cent trusted Mr Cameron, Mr Osborne and Mr Clegg with the economy, against 26 per cent for the Labour team, suggesting that Lib Dem influence on the coalition's economic policy is welcomed by voters. Of those questioned, 24 per cent said they were satisfied with the job Mr Cameron is doing as PM, and a further 33 per cent say they are dissatisfied but would prefer to have him in Downing Street than Mr Miliband.

Only 30 per cent would rather see the Labour leader in Number 10.

Some 40 per cent said they expect a Labour government after the next election, while 29 per cent forecast a Conservative government, 13 per cent another Conservative-Lib Dem coalition and 18 per cent a Labour-Lib Dem pact.

Some 2,060 adults were interviewed online and 1,007 by telephone between May 31 and June 2.
