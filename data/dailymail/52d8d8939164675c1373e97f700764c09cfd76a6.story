Gus Poyet will need to crack the curse of Sunderland’s Monday malaise if they are to emerge from the relegation zone at Crystal Palace.

The Black Cats have not won in 20 attempts on a Monday in the Premier League, a wretched run stretching back to April Fools’ Day, 2002.

Poyet is the ninth permanent boss who has failed to reverse the trend. He lost at home to West Ham and at Spurs last season and now takes on another London opponent in desperate need of victory.

Sunderland boss Gus Poyet wants his side to 'finish' their 'terrible' Monday night record against Palace 

SUNDERLAND XI (4-1-4-1): Pantilimon; Reveillere, Vergini, O’Shea, Van Aanholt; Cattermole; Buckley, Rodwell, Larsson; Johnson; Fletcher.

‘It’s not a nice record. It’s difficult to accept,’ said the Uruguayan.

‘It’s not normal because probably in those 20 games we’ve played home and away, and against top teams and small teams.

‘Maybe the players don’t like to play on a Monday night. Maybe we should ask the FA to let us play at another time. Maybe Friday!

‘But it’s a terrible stat and it doesn’t lie. I suppose it’s a great chance to finish it. Let’s see if we can do it.’

Poyet and his team face trial by television at Selhurst Park as they look to recover from back-to-back defeats which have plunged them in to the bottom three.

The boss, though, insists he is not concerned by a national audience.

‘I like the telly, that’s where everybody can see you. You need to perform,’ he said.

‘I prefer to take a risk and show everybody what we can do on TV. That way everybody can see how we respond after the 8-0 hammering against Southampton.’

Poyet was in charge of Brighton when they met Palace in the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2013.

The Eagles eventually won promotion to the Premier League but Poyet left Brighton that summer amid the lingering row over excrement smeared in Palace’s dressing-room at the AMEX Stadium.

And Poyet, who was furious about the incident, said: ‘I can’t explain it, no. It would be nice if one day someone could explain it to all of us because we still don’t know what happened. Seriously. Nothing.’

He added: ‘I’ll probably get a hostile reception. I like that as well. When nobody cares about you, that’s when you feel rubbish.’

Poyet, meanwhile, will include Steven Fletcher after the striker trained over the weekend. There had been fears the two-goal top scorer had broken a metatarsal during the 2-0 defeat to Arsenal but he is fit and will lead the line.
