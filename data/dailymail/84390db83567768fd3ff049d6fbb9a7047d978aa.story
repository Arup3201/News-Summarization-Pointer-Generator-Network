The £16million signing is keen to play a part in the club's title ambitions and was put through his paces by the club's coaching staff while the rest of his new team-mates had a rest day following their 3-1 Premier League defeat to Manchester City on Monday night.

He told Liverpoolfc.com: 'When I first played three or four games with Inter Milan, when I was young, I had No 45 because the numbers for young players were from No 36 to No 50.

'I took No 45 because I was joking that four plus five is nine - and I scored in all four games.

'It brings me luck and that's why I've always kept No 45.'

All smiles: Balotelli has chosen the No 45 at Liverpool as it has brought him luck in the past
