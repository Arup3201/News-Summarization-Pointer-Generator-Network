Asbo: Stacey Salder, 18, is pictured leaving King's Lynn Magistrates' Court after being banned from the town of Holt, Norfolk

This is the face of the 18-year-old who 'terrorised' a Georgian market town patronised by royal figures including the Duchess of Cambridge and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall.

Stacey Sadler repeatedly swore at officers, kicked a police car's wing mirror and threw soup around her cell after she was arrested.

She was often seen drinking on the streets of Holt, not far from the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

Sadler was arrested and bailed after a confrontation with officers, but breached her conditions by walking down the street days later with a bottle of wine.

She was today given a two-year Anti-Social Behaviour Order (Asbo), which bans her from the town and prevents her from drinking in public anywhere in Norfolk.

She is also banned from 'causing alarm, annoyance or distress to others'.

Magistrates warned her that she could be jailed if she broke the terms of the order and was brought back to court.

Sadler, from Hempstead, near Holt, was fined £400 for threatening behaviour and breaching three conditional discharges, but was told she does not have to pay the fine as she had already spent seven days in custody.

She was also ordered to pay £450 of her benefit payments to police for three acts of criminal damage to two police cars and a cell. Sadler admitted all the charges.

Holt has become increasingly popular with members of the Royal family in recent years.

The Duchess of Cambridge, who is set to move into nearby Anmer Hall with Prince William, has been spotted browsing in the town’s antique shops.

The Duchess of Cornwall has also become a regular visitor, often choosing to buy Christmas presents for Prince Charles at several shops including Holt’s antiquarian bookshop.

The court heard that Sadler had committed ‘numerous’ offences of anti-social and threatening behaviour in Holt in recent months and had been in court several times.

Prosecutor Alison Cotterill said: 'There have been efforts to make her improve her behaviour, but month after month after month she has been before the court. Drink has been recognised as a problem leading her to behave in a certain way.'

She said that police considered Sadler to be ‘a central figure’ in a group of youths involved in anti-social behaviour.

Miss Cotterill added: 'They did make stringent efforts to intervene including drawing up an "acceptable behaviour contract" for her not to drink in public or cause a nuisance.

'That was arranged at a meeting, but afterwards she became drunk and was arrested in Holt. The police have tried to address her behaviour, but there has been little or no response. They feel the time has come for an Asbo.'

The court heard how police were called to a deal with a group of rowdy youths in the town’s market place early in the evening on November 20.

Sadler, who was in the group, was seen hurling a bottle of cider which smashed in the road near family with young children, said Miss Cotterill.

When officers approached her, she screamed abuse, shouting: 'F*** off, you c***s. F*** off, I am going to kill you.'

Sadler was arrested for a public order offence and ended up struggling with an officer in front of several witnesses. She kicked a Ford Mondeo police car as she was being taken to a police van, causing £300 of damage to the door.

Sadler was restrained and taken to 
the Aylsham police investigation centre, where she hurled a mug of soup 
against her cell door.

When asked why she had done it, she replied, "Because you lot f***ed me off". She later made no comment in police interview.

Sadler appeared in court the next day, charged with threatening behaviour and criminal damage.

She
was bailed as long as she stayed away from Holt, but police saw her in 
the town again on November 23, walking along the street and drinking a 
bottle of wine.

She 
was later arrested for breaching her bail, said Miss Cotterill, but when
officers arrived to speak to her, she asked to go outside for a 
cigarette and ran away.

Neil Meachem, defending, said Sadler came from a good family and had never been involved in trouble before an incident earlier this year which left her ‘upset and angry’ led her to start drinking heavily.

He added: 'It is almost like a cry for help. She has been drinking to black out what happened. She needs counselling, help and support.'

Presiding magistrate Barbara Dennis said the Asbo was necessary to protect the people of Holt from her behaviour.

She told her: 'You can’t go around, taking it out on other people and resorting to alcohol. It is not the answer. You are 18 and you have got your life in front of you and you should not go out terrorising people.

'The people of Holt have got a right to be protected and live without being put in fear. The police are also not here to be insulted and threatened.'
