Glamorous in a black lace gown and a sparkling diamond tiara, Spain's Queen Letizia was every inch the royal style icon as she arrived for a state dinner in Madrid last night.

The event, which was held to honour Michelle Bachelet, the visiting President of Chile, took place in the Zarzuela Palace.

Ms Bachelet, who was elected in March, also chose a glamorous lace get-up, albeit in elegant grey rather than dramatic black.

Earlier, Letizia, 42, and husband King Felipe, 46, had welcomed the Chilean president in a lavish ceremony that included taking a salute from a guard of honour outside the El Pardo Palace.

The encounter with the Spanish couple is not, however, Ms Bachelet's first brush with a royal since taking the helm.

In June, Ms Bachelet, a socialist, was left beaming after Prince Harry made a state visit to the country and met with her at the Palacio de La Moneda in Santiago.

This time around, the president, who seems to be at risk of becoming a monarchist, was left smiling after a chat with King Felipe during the ceremony and was seen beaming broadly later on during the state dinner.

Ms Bachelet is in Spain for high level talks aimed at boosting trade relations between her South American nation and the EU.

Letizia, meanwhile, is fresh from a successful trip to Austria where she made a speech at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna.

The speech, which was made partly in German and in English, was to art fans during the launch of an exhibition dedicated to the Spanish artist, Diego Velázquez.

Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe.

Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.

It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood.

 Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita.

Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, last week, joined King Felipe for the launch of a new Spanish language dictionary.

Much of her time has also been spent travelling, with successful visits to the UN in New York and to King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima in the Hague alongside King Felipe, among her most recent trips.

Dramatic: The smartly uniformed honour guard formed a dramatic backdrop for the welcome ceremony

Esteem: Unusually, the ceremony was held at the grand El Pardo Palace instead of the Zarzuela

Stylish: As is her wont, Queen Letizia cut a glamorous figure as she made her way down the El Pardo's steps
