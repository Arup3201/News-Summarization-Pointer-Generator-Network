It's well-known that marijuana will get you high, but a lesser known side-effect is that it can alter our response to negative emotions and images.

A recent study has taken a look at the brain’s functioning in the presence of tetrahydrocannabinoid (THC) to understand how marijuana can affect the way we process emotions.

THC is the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant.

The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week

The European Neuropsychopharmacology journal has published a study that has confirmed the positive effect of THC to negative stimuli.

The study, which was undertaken at the University Medical Center Utrecht in the Netherlands, claims that THC activates the endocannabinoid system naturally found in the brain to alter our response to negative images or emotions.

With this discovery, the study argues that marijuana may now be touted as a cure to depression and other mental ilnesses.

The research tested a group of men who were active users of marijuana. To qualify they had to have taken the drug four times or more in a year but not more than once a week.

THC was administered to one group while another was given a placebo.

The men were then asked to mimic images of facial expressions either 'happy' or 'fearful'.

According to the study, people who had THC in their bloodstream were less accurate in matching the fearful facial expressions.

However, they were able to perfectly copy those that looked happy.

The results were confirmed by MRI scans of the men’s brains that revealed a beneficial effect of THC on emotion-processing cerebral regions.

'THC administration reduces the negative bias in emotional processing,' said the report.

'This adds human evidence to support the hypothesis that the endocannabinoid system is involved in modulation of emotional processing.'

Scientists claim more studies  - such as those using scans (pictured) - are needed to understand the long-term impact of cannabis in adolescence

A study published last month 
found that teenagers who regularly smoke cannabis suffer long lasting 
brain damage and are in much greater danger of developing schizophrenia.

American researchers 
said the drug is particularly dangerous for a group of people who have a
 genetic susceptibility to the mental health disorder - and it could be 
the trigger.

Asaf Keller, of
 the University of Maryland School of Medicine, said the results 
highlight the dangers of teenagers smoking cannabis during their 
formative years.
