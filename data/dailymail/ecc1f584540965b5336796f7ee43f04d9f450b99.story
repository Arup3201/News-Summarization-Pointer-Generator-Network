Former Liverpool managing director Christian Purslow has joined Chelsea's board to run their global commercial activities.

In a boardroom shake-up following the departure of chief executive Ron Gourlay last week, Purslow has been appointed with chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia assuming Gourlay's executive responsibilities.

Purslow was appointed Liverpool's managing director in June 2009. He oversaw the sale of the club in 2010 and remained on their board as a non-executive director until February 2011.

A statement on Chelsea's website reads: 'Chelsea football club is pleased to announce that Christian Purslow is joining the club to run our global commercial activities. Mr Purslow's appointment is effective ‎immediately.

'The club has ambitious plans to build the Premier League's most pioneering global commercial programme, partnering with innovative and market-leading organisations from around the world. The club believes Mr Purslow has the vision and the leadership qualities to help us achieve these plans.

‎'Chelsea does not expect to announce any other senior appointments in the near future.'

Ron Gourlay had been Chelsea's chief executive from September 2009 but left the club to pursue other business opportunities. 

Purslow fills part of the void created when Ron Gourlay left his role last week after five years as chief executive.

Gourlay's non-commercial activities will be assumed by Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia, who are both members of the club's board.
