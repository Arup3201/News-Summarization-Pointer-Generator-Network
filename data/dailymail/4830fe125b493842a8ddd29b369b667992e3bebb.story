Liverpool's poor start to the season is down to 'a dark cloud hanging over Anfield'  according to former Reds star John Toshack.

Brendan Rodgers side lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Champions League on Tuesday night and have now won just six of their 16 games in all competitions. 

Toshack, who played for the Merseyside club for eight years, believes his old side are struggling for form because they have not yet recovered from narrowly missing out on the Premier League title last term.

Rodgers' men lost 2-0 at home to Chelsea on April 27 before throwing away a three-goal lead at Crystal Palace to draw 3-3 with the Eagles just over a week later. 

Those results allowed Manchester City to swoop in and land their second title in three years on the final day of the season, something Toshack feels the Reds have not yet forgotten.

Speaking to BBC Radio 4 on Wednesday, Toshack said: 'I still think there is a hangover there from what happened at Crystal Palace last season, a bitter pill to swallow.

'At the moment, obviously Liverpool I think need to get some silverware on the table pretty quickly.

'I think what happened at the end of last season... I've seen situations like that myself and it can hang around for a while. I still think there is a bit of a dark cloud hanging over Anfield from what happened.

'They went so close after being so long without winning that championship. I still think they are feeling the effects of that I think.' 

Liverpool's Champions League hopes are hanging by a thread after Tuesday night's defeat at the Bernabeu, a result which means they could miss out on qualification to the knockout stages.

Asked if the club would finish in the top four this season and get another chance in Europe's elite club competition, Toshack said: 'Well it's still very early with the changes they have made. They have lost a player (Luis Suarez) who is key to everything they did last season and then it's not always easy to replace people like that.

'Maybe people who have come in haven't delivered as quickly as they would have liked.

'They don’t look to be firing on all cylinders at the moment to me.'
