Most people enjoy a game of Jenga in the kitchen on a rainy Sunday afternoon, but these American farmers decided to play the big game - by knocking down a silo.

The video starts as the man has knocked down nearly half of the concrete panels, and the demolition process is near an end.

The construction, which appears to be a concrete stave silo, would previously have been used to store grains or food for livestock.

The man behind the camera can be heard shouting that he has never 'dropped' a silo before, and the ensuing near-death experience proves it.

Seconds later, the man with the hammer whacks away the last bearing panel, and has to run for his life as the entire concrete tower comes down from above.  

Bringing down the house: When the video begins, the man had already taken down a significant portion of the silo's panels

Let's play Jenga! The unidentified man swings a sledgehammer and whacks away at the concrete panels on a silo

Getting there: The man takes the concrete panels down one by one to see which one will be the final 'straw' for the silo

Timber! As the man lifts the sledgehammer to hit again, the silo begins to give way

Time to run: The man drops his hammer as he realises that his life is at stake if he stays put

Smash and dash: The man comes up to the cameraman as he runs from the falling silo and the debris coming off it

Destruction: Although their project carried a high risk, it cannot be argued that it is an effective way to bring down a silo

Hammertime: As the dust settles the men look out over the debris, high-five and congratulate themselves on a job well done, before agreeing it is probably best 'not to tell Diane'
