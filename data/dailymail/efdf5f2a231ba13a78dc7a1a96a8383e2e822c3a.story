If a dog becomes trapped in icy water, owners are always advised not to follow them in.

And this video shows why it really is best to leave it to the experts.  

The footage, captured in Poland, shows a black dog clearly in distress as it clings onto a ice sheet, having fallen into the water. 

The fireman puts his own safety on the line for the desperate dog who was trapped in an icy river

After struggling to get its legs going on exit, the dog soon scampers off after being pulled free

The action is shot by a pedestrian on a bridge above the stranded pooch, who barks and whines, and is clearly in a perilous position.

But a group of firemen come up with an ingenious way to help rescue the dog before it perishes due to the cold. 

One brave firefighter edges down the ladder, before extending a hooked stick forward towards the shivering canine to snare the collar.

Soon the dog is pulled from the icy water - the lack of balance in it's legs on exiting demonstrating how the cold has affected its muscles.

The watching audience break out into a round of applause for the successful rescue effort, and the dog scampers off.
