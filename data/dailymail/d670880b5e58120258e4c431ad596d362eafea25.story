Traditional British cooker manufacturer AGA, favoured by TV chefs Mary Berry and Nigella Lawson, has today launched in China with a brand new feature: a wok burner.

Taking the leap into the new market is arguably the biggest gamble the firm, which has been selling ovens in Britain since 1929, has ever made.

Most Chinese kitchens have just two gas hobs and, if they have an oven at all, it is usually cheap and the size of a microwave.

Gamble: AGA has been selling cookers in Britain since 1929 and launching in China is seen as a big gamble. Daniel Wong (front), AGA’s director of business development in China, said shifting eating habits among the country’s rich influenced the company’s decision to launch there

But AGA is targeting the country's new middle class and chief executive William McGrath told MailOnline he was confident he could convince people to spend between £5,400 and £27,000 on the British favourite.

The launch was announced in 2012, but due to China’s unfamiliarity with ovens and  laws about accreditation for them, it was derailed.

Accreditation rules have been re-drafted by authorities and now, three years later, AGAs are finally available to order.

Mr McGrath, speaking in Beijing ahead of the official launch event, conceded that the cookers could just become popular with a ‘small niche market connecting with expats in China’.

However, he said that it was worth the risk because if they prove popular with the country’s 1.35 billion population it will be a ‘game changer’ for the firm.

‘We’re quietly confident, and that comes from talking to people in the industry as well as consumers,’ he said. 

‘The answer to whether it’ll work seems to be, “It’s definitely worth a go”. But nobody is saying this is definitely going to work.’

AGA products are synonymous with cosy comfort food such as Sunday roasts and Victoria sponges. The Prince of Wales, David Cameron, Delia Smith and even Jeremy Clarkson, who was dropped by the BBC this week, own one.

Despite the company's rich British history, it has teamed up with China-based firm Beijing Hi Seasons for the rollout and Mr McGrath said he’s hoping that  families in China will use the cookers to make traditional Chinese food.

As such, the RedFyre AGA models being launched in China resemble those available in Britain but with a crucial difference: a wok burner on top.

China’s new moneyed middle class has a huge appetite for western luxury brands, from Chanel clothes to Land Rovers.

Daniel Wong, AGA’s director of business development in China, told MailOnline that shifting eating habits among the country’s rich also influenced the company’s decision to launch there.

‘Five years ago in China, when people got money they just dined out in expensive restaurants,’ he said. 

‘But affluent people have started cooking at home more, showing off to friends, saying: “I can cook”. We’ve seen a rise in cooking schools and sales of cooking magazines.’

Nobel Prize-winning physicist Dr Gustaf Dalén invented the world's first heat-storage cooker in 1922.

After a failed experiment cost him his sight, the doting husband wanted to make a better appliance for his wife Elma.

According to the AGA website, Dr Dalén created a cast-iron cooker capable of every kind of cooking simultaneously, with two large hotplates and two ovens. 

The AGA was invented and by 1929, manufacturing was underway at the AGA Heat Ltd factory in Smethwick.

AGAs are now made at the company's Shropshire foundry in Coalbrookdale and are still made by pouring molten iron into moulds. However the modern cookers contain state-of-the-art technology.

A cascade of recent high-profile food safety scandals in China has also contributed to a rise in home cooking, as confidence in restaurant standards has dropped.

Although AGA sales were up in 2014 in the UK, the company is reaching near saturation point in the country – after all, you’re only likely to buy an AGA once. 

Last year the company, which produced its millionth Rangemaster cooker this month, released a slimline City60 model aimed at UK city dwellers in an attempt to find new buyers.

Mr McGrath denied that succeeding in China was essential for the company but added: ‘We want to win some away games. 

'China and Germany, where we’re also expanding, are fascinating because they’re outside of our comfort zone.’

Consumer analyst Paul French recently told the Financial Times: ‘In China, if you have the kind of money to spend on an AGA, you generally have someone who cooks for you.’

But Mr Wong and Mr McGrath said that the AGA is billed as a family-orientated product and this would chime well in the country.

‘Now, in China, the generation that earns money doesn’t just leave behind their parents,’ Mr Wong said. 

‘They bring them back home. So we see families with one kid, two kids, together with grandparents, and Chinese love family gatherings.’

Another potential pitfall for the AGA is the risk of copycat manufacturers ripping them off and undercutting them. 

Trademark, copyright and patent abuse in China is often flagrant, and it seems inevitable that if AGA takes off, knock-off products with similar names will start popping up.

‘We’re just going to concentrate on pushing our brand really hard,’ said Mr McGrath. 

‘We know those stories [of rip-off products] are a concern for everyone, but you’ve got to go with what you know. This brand has stood for 90 years because it stands for something.’

While it’s hugely ambitious to try to get a generation of Chinese to ditch cooking traditions that stretch back generations, Mr McGrath said that if the gamble pays off, he’ll set his sites on conquering the rest of Asia.

‘China could be an entry point to Asia,’ he said. ‘If it works here it’d obviously follow on to look at other markets here.’
