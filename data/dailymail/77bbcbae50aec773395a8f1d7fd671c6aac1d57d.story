Billionaire media mogul and founder of CNN Ted Turner is selling his private island off the coast of South Carolina for $23.7milllion - because his family does not use it enough.

The 75-year-old entrepreneur and philanthropist, who is reportedly worth more than $2billion, bought the 4,680-acre St. Phillips Island in 1979, adding to his giant portfolio that has made him the largest landowner in the United States. 

The property, which is southeast of St. Helena Island near Port Royal Sound, is only reachable by boat, with a huge network of surrounding docks, while residents can only travel around in an SUV.

The main house - set on a dirt road four miles from the island's dock - has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a large screened-in porch. The island is also self-sufficient, with its own water tower, solar panels and generator.

Turner, who used to own the Atlanta Braves, told The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday he was selling the island because it isn't used enough. Previously his family had enjoyed sailing, fishing and entertaining visitors there during vacations. 

On the property's listing, he wrote: 'My family and I have owned St Phillips Island along the South Carolina coast for many years now. While we have enjoyed the island and made so many memories there, we, unfortunately, are not able to visit as much as we would like. Therefore, we have chosen to sell the property in an attempt to pass on St. Phillips Island to another family who will enjoy this natural oasis as much as we did.'

Secluded: Ted Turner, the media mogul who founded CNN, is selling St. Phillips Island off the South Carolina coast for $23.7million. The main house on the private island has five bedrooms, five bathrooms and a closed-off porch 

Holiday home: He purchased the property, which is southeast of St. Helena Island near Port Royal Sound, in 1979 and ever since his family have enjoyed fishing, sailing and entertaining visitors there during vacations

Transport: It is only accessible by boat, but is surrounded by a large network of docking systems. Once on the island, visitors or residents generally use an SUV to get around, or can enjoy the scenery on foot

Vast: According to the Plantation Services, the estate agents based in Albany, Georgia who are selling the island, very few off the South Carolina and Georgia coast are totally private and have such a large amount of land 

Landscape: Marsh and Creeks North End (pictured) offers stunning views of the Atlantic. Turner said one of the reasons he was selling the space is because his family could not visit it as much as they would like 

Picturesque: As the sun sets over St. Phillips Island, residents can still see the other Barrier Islands in the distance. A walkway allows you to look out across the ocean 

Essentials: There is a separate home for the caretaker or the island's management (left). The property is also completely self-sufficient with its own water tower and system of solar panels

Inside: The interior of the main house is decorated with fishing memorabilia and also has a widescreen television. The philanthropist hopes that the new owners will 'enjoy the natural oasis as much as we did'

Views: One of the jetties stretching out into the sea has a collection of loungers enabling residents to enjoy the Atlantic coast sunshine 

Media mogul and philanthropist: Turner is responsible for setting up CNN, the world's first 24 hours news station, and WTBS which began the concept of a superstation. He is also the largest landowner in the United States
