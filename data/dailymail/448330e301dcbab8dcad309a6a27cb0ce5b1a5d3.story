It's all the fault of the Women's Institute. Since the good ladies of Rylstone WI stripped off for charity in 1999, the public has been assailed by a flood of naked calendars.

We've seen naked firemen, semi-clad carpenters, stripped butchers, bare bakers - in all probability, there is a calendar somewhere that features a bunch of unclothed candlestick makers, coyly covering their bits with tapers.

Now, we have the ladies of the Camp Hill Rugby Club, who have just launched their own black and white effort. And it's quite possibly the worst yet.

The girls of the Camps Hill Rugby Club get their kit off for January as a man - a coach, perhaps? - checks their studs

Team manager Jessica Ham said: 'We're pleased with the way it came out; we wanted it to be fun and tasteful'

The all-female team got their kit off to raise money for their club. Perhaps keen to save pennies, they appear to have neglected to engage the services of a professional photographer and shot the pictures in a dingy pub and what appears to be their club changing rooms.

Lighting is also an issue. No-one looks good under a harsh, fluorescent bulb, least of all a naked rugby prop forward.

The girls are seen sprawled over pool tables and a sticky-looking bar top in the grotty drinking den.

In a grimy corridor one girl is laid out on a stretcher in almost complete darkness whilst four other semi-clad ladies surround her.

In one particularly disturbing scene, the girls are posed with bottoms facing camera as a man lurks in the gloom, bending down to check their boots.

May features a line of smiling lovelies - rugby boots at the ready, naturally. Spoilsport locals have asked the girls NOT to release a calendar for 2015

'I
 think it's a brave thing that they've done but they can't seriously 
think it looks any good,' says disgruntled local resident, June Birchall, 43

Not that the team, based in Shirley, Birmingham, thought that there was anything wrong with the calendar.

Team manager Jessica Ham said: 'We're pleased with the way it came out; we wanted it to be fun and tasteful.'

However not everyone agrees.

'I
 think it's a brave thing that they've done but they can't seriously 
think it looks any good,' said local resident, June Birchall, 43.

The women's team, known as the Chargers, did the calendar to raise money for their club. 'We're a self-funded club and there's no money in women's rugby so we need to be inventive when fund-raising,' said Jessica, the team manager

'Maybe
 if they had hired a professional to do the pictures and not picked 
their local pub as the location it wouldn't look so bloody terrible.'

However local residents continue to be unimpressed and have called on them not to release one for 2015.

'I think we've seen enough of them to last a lifetime.'

The girls of Camp Hill Rugby Club in Shirley, Birmingham have raised eyebrows in their neighbourhood, with some saying they've seen rather too much of the ladies

March sees the girls on their shorts, rugby socks pulled up to their knees - and not much else!
