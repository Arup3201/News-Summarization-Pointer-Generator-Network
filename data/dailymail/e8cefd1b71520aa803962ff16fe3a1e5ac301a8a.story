Troubled Olympic swimming legend Ian Thorpe was taken to hospital today after he was discovered 'acting oddly' in the street near his parents' home.

Police were called to the street in Panania, south of Sydney, at around 3.15am by a neighbour who had seen a man behaving oddly near a vehicle.

According to a report, officers found Thorpe, 31, sitting in his car a short distance away. He was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. 

Neighbours called police after seeing a man behaving suspiciously in the street: Officers discovered Ian Thorpe and he was taken to hospital

Back to the start: After spending nearly 18 months in Switzerland, Mr Thorpe returned to Australia just before Christmas and has been staying with his parents in Sydney

A police spokesman said: 'Emergency services were called to a home in Panania about 3.15am after concerns were raised about a man seen near a vehicle.

'Police spoke to a man (who) was taken to hospital for a medical assessment. No official complaint has been made and no further police action is anticipate.'

Thorpe has spoken of his battle with depression and alcohol and last week an Australian newspaper claimed that he was in rehab.

However, his management later said that this was not true and he had been treated in hospital for a shoulder injury. 

‘Following a fall at home on Tuesday, Ian was admitted to hospital after sustaining an injury to his shoulder,' said a spokesman. 'He underwent surgery on Wednesday and was discharged the following day.'

The spokesman went on: 'On Sunday (Australian time) Ian was taken to Bankstown Hospital and then onto a rehabilitation clinic after being found disorientated and trying to get in to what he thought was a friend’s car.

'Ian had been on a series of pain killers and anti-depressants following surgery on his shoulder. No alcohol was involved and Ian was admitted to rehabilitation for his ongoing struggle with depression.'

The five-time Olympic gold medallist wrote about his battle with 'crippling depression' in his 2013 biography.

He revealed that at some of the worst times he turned to alcohol in a bid to quell the thoughts running about his head.

Success: Thorpe, seen with his gold medal after winning the 200-meter freestyle at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian

The 31-year-old dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years after winning his first World Championship in 1998, aged 14

The swimmer said he also felt the need to stay silent about his depression, thinking it was a 'character flaw'.

'Not even my family is aware that I've spent a lot of my life battling what I can only describe as a crippling depression.’

He admits in the book that he is ready to speak to his parents about his depression, but this is the first time he has been reported to have sought treatment.

‘Yes, it's serious but there's not a lot I can or want to add,’ broadcaster Alan Jones, a close friend of Ian Thorpe told the Herald Sun.

‘Ian is a beautiful person but he has difficulty recognising his problems.’

After becoming the world's youngest male World Champion in the 1998 Perth World Championships, he dominated the shorter freestyle distances for several years.

He still holds the records of most Olympic gold medals won by an Australian (five) and became the first person to win six golds in one championship in 2001.

He took a break from swimming in 2004, after the Athens Olympics, but failed to make a comeback two years later due to illness and chose instead to retire.

He attempted a comeback ahead of the London 2012 Olympics but only made it to the second day of Australia's Olympic Trials in Adelaide, and instead worked as a pundit for the BBC during the games.

Shortly after London 2012 he moved to Switzerland, but returned to Australia in December last year.
