Former Manchester City striker Robinho is suing an Italian newspaper over claims that the footballer was involved in the alleged gang rape of an 18-year-old girl. 

The 30-year-old Brazil international strongly denied the claims on his personal website and announced that he was taking legal action. 

The Corriere Della Sera said the former Manchester City player, who signed for the club in September 2008 in a £33 million deal, was under investigation over an alleged sexual assault.

Robinho said he was taking legal action against an Italian newspaper who printed the allegations 

The Mirror reported that the player was 'outraged' by the allegations and said he was taking legal action.

According to the statement: 'With regard to reports involving the footballer Robson de Souza (Robinho) irresponsibly circulated by the Italian media and picked up in Brazil without any attempt at verifying the truth, Robinho denies any involvement in the said incident.'

Robinho spent two years at Manchester City and was sold to AC Milan for just £15 million and has since returned to Brazil where he plays for Santos. 

As a teenager, Robinho was regarded as 'the new Pele' by Brazilian football fans but his move to Europe has been regarded as a failure. 

He has scored 27 times for the national team over 95 appearances.
