Sarah Palin has lashed out at the disgraced Secret Service agent who joked about protecting her in a post on his Facebook page.

David Randall Chaney, a 48-year-old supervisor, wrote that he was 'really checking out' the vice-presidential candidate when he guarded her during the 2008 election campaign.

But Ms Palin last night hit back at the married agent who lost his job in the wake of the Colombia prostitution scandal, calling his conduct 'pretty embarrassing'.

Scandal: David Randall Chaney, right, said he was 'really checking out' Sarah Palin when he guarded her during the 2008 election campaign

'This agent was kind of ridiculous in
 posting pictures and comments about checking someone out,' she said on 
Fox News. 'Well check this out, bodyguard - you're fired! And I hope his
 wife... sends him to the dog house.'

'A
 lot of people will say this is boys being boys, and boys will be boys, 
but they shouldn't be in positions of authority. I think it's pretty 
embarrassing,' the 48-year-old added. 'I've had enough of these men being dogs and not being responsible.'

Palin said it was 'a symptom of government run amok'. 'It's like, who's minding the store around here?' she told Fox News.

'The 
president, for one, he better be wary, there, of when Secret Service is 
accompanying his family on vacation. They may be checking out the first 
lady instead of guarding her.'

Proposal: Dania Suarez is at the centre of the Secret Service prostitution scandal after claiming an agent refused to pay her $800 for sex as they had agreed

Eleven Secret Service employees have so far been put on administrative leave following the incident in Colombia that involved at least some agency personnel bringing prostitutes to their hotel room.

The scandal, which involves as many as 20 Colombian women, broke last week after a fight over payment between a prostitute and a Secret Service agent spilled into the hotel hallway.

At least three more officers were expected to lose their jobs today, according to a federal official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he or she was not authorized to disclose the news ahead of the announcement.

The other named supervisor who has been 
forced out of the service has been identified as Greg Stokes, who was in
 charge of the K-9 division of the agency.

Both Stokes and Chaney have worked at the agency for around two decades, and have been involved with protecting the President.

Chaney,
 who is based in Washington, DC and lives in Ashburn, Virginia, wrote about working with Ms Palin on Facebook, according to the Washington Post.

He posted numerous pictures with her in the foreground and him standing in the background wearing a suit and dark glasses.

After a friend suggested that Chaney had 'real chemistry' with the Alaska governor, he replied: 'I was really checking her out, if you know what I mean?'

Summit: The scandal occurred while the Secret Service was preparing for President Barack Obama's trip to a conference of world leaders

Chaney, whose father was also a 
Secret Service agent, joined the agency in 1987 and was supervisor of 
the department which supports the force's work internationally.

It is not known what role he played in the incident which saw the police called to a Colombian hotel to resolve an argument between a prostitute and an agent who she claimed owed her money.

The scandal, which occurred while the Secret Service was preparing for President Obama's trip to a conference of world leaders, has proved embarrassing to the agency.

Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said he would 'clean house' by removing agents more concerned with 'their personal play time' than protecting the President.
