A dentist is suing a man and a woman for posting a negative review of his business on Yelp.

Elise Golbert and her then-husband Jeff Cullen branded Dr Parsa Zedah a 'butcher' and a 'crook' in a 357-word review of the Beverly Hills surgery.

Golbert, a professional model, was told she needed $30,000 surgery to align her jawbones if she wanted to eliminate her persistent neck pain.

Review: Her then-husband Jeff Cullen took to review site Yelp to brand Dr Zedah a 'butcher' and a 'crook'

But when she emerged, she claimed, she 'had bigger teeth than any man around me'.

Infuriated, her husband took to the reviewing site, where millions of people give stores, restaurants, bars, cafes and landmarks a star-rating plus a few comments.

Now, four years later, the pair are being sued for libel despite removing the review.

However, it comes just weeks after Governor Jerry Brown sanctioned the 'Yelp law', or Assembly Bill 2365, which bans companies from fining customers for online reviews.

Dr Zedah insists the review contained lies and false allegations.

'It was nothing other than, 'Folks, this is our experience. Watch out,'' Cullen told ABC7.

'The last thing I need in my life is to have to go to court over something as ridiculous as this.

'This the First Amendment. This is your right as an American to voice your opinion. I wasn't out to slander,' Cullen said.

Golbert is enraged as she claims she had nothing to do with the review.

'I'm not even the one who wrote the Yelp review. I don't know what he's suing me for. I really don't,' Golbert said.
