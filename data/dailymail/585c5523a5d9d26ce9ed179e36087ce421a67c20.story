As a teenager she was demoralised by cruel taunts about her body.

But today Lizzie Haines, 31, is happy to showcase her curves after being crowned plus size model of the year by lingerie firm Curvy Kate.

The self-employed wedding photographer, beat 400 other hopefuls in the annual 'Star in a Bra' competition and has since been parading her  size 14 body and 32H bust down the 
catwalk.Â 

5ft 4.5in Lizzie felt 'fat and frumpy' because of her large 
bust and as a result resorted to wearing baggy clothes

For years,  5ft 4.5in Lizzie felt 'fat and frumpy' because of her large 
bust and resorted to wearing baggy clothes.

As she approached her thirtieth birthday she finally decided to confront her hangups and entered the national modelling competition 'on a whim'.

To her surprise she scooped first place with 64,000 votes, and was awarded the Plus Size Model of the Year award at the 100 per cent 
people Plus Size Awards 2011.

Lizzie, 31, from Uppingham, in Rutland, revelling in her recent achievements, said: 'At 31, it is a real level of acceptance.

Transformation: Now with a newfound confidence Lizzie 
has modelled at shows in Paris and across the UK

'I entered the competition on a whim 
last year. It was a turning 30 crazy act. I just thought what the heck, 
I'll go for it. It's been really great.

'To begin with it was really surreal. Standing in your pants was not something I thought I would ever do.'

Since school Lizzie had been embarrassed by curvaceous figure, which attracted unwanted attention.

She said: 'I was a later bloomer. When my boobs
 came in, boy did they come in. There is a sort of stigma. It seems acceptable that people can talk about your boobs.

'People would yell at me in the street. I was brought to tears. It can be really destructive.

'There is a fine line. I have never dressed provocatively. I never showed off my cleavage. Most of the time I got attention I was covered up.

'The clothes I had to wear did not 
fit well. Everything hung from my boobs, which made me feel really fat 
and frumpy.'

Now with a newfound confidence Lizzie has modelled at shows in Paris and across the UK, wearing a selection of revealing designs.

She has just finished shooting the 
new winter catalogue and has been recruited as a judge and mentor 
with the lingerie firm this year.

Lizzie, who lives with her 
boyfriend of two years Alex, 29, said: 'The level of acceptance I have got comes with age. I have had a massive turn about but I struggled when I was a teenager.

'I wouldn't walk with my back 
straight because it looked like I was showing off my boobs and being 
arrogant so instead I slumped and walked with my arms across my chest.'

To keep in shape Lizzie enjoys swimming but never diets because it makes her 'miserable' and she loves food too much.

Lizzie added: 'I have no idea where it will take me but 2011 has been a year of highs.'
