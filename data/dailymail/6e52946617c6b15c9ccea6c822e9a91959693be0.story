A female former MP has been accused of abusing a schoolboy at a drug-fuelled Westminster sex party in the 1980s.

Her alleged victim has claimed he was forced to perform a sex act on the woman politician at one of a number of parties, where it is alleged that children as young as 13 were abused.

Andrew Ash, now 45, has claimed that as a teenager he was regularly taken to London from northern England, where he was in care, to attend the depraved parties.

Allegations: Andrew Ash, now 45, has told Scotland Yard that he was abused by a former female MP at a drug-fuelled Westminster sex party

Mr Ash told the Sunday Express newspaper that he has passed the name of the former MP, who can not be named for legal reasons, to the Metropolitan Police.

He has alleged that the depraved parties were organised by a paedophile ring involving David Smith, Jimmy Savile's  former chauffeur who was found dead on the day he was due to stand trial for child sex crimes uncovered by Operation Yewtree.

Mr Ash said that a number of politicians and celebrities, including Savile, attended the parties, where drugs such as cocaine and speed would be supplied to revellers, as well as bottles of champagne.

He said that the woman MP had been drunk at the time of the assault, and had been laughing as she carried out the abuse.

'I didn’t really know what was going on but the others around her were goading her on', he told the Sunday Express, adding that he felt 'humilated'.

Last year police were believed to have seized video footage and photographs allegedly taken at a sex party from a well-known paedophile.

Mr Ash claimed that there is footage showing a senior male MP in the same frame as him, although no abuse can be seen taking place. 

He said he had been interviewed for 70 hours by the Met Police’s Paedophile Unit, both at a safe house in Bridlington, East Yorkshire and in London, but said he is frustrated by a lack of action.

Mr Ash said he was molested by the male MP on another occasion, who abused him an a garage behind a Rolls-Royce.

'Another politician turned up with a video camera but the man abusing me just smirked and joked, "OK, OK, I’ll vote any way you want" as if he was being blackmailed. What I want to know is why they haven’t arrested him yet if they have this evidence,' he said.

Mr Ash said that as well as speaking to police officers during his interviews, he believes that intelligence officers, who had been made aware of the high-profile names he had accused, were also present.

Dutch officials also sat in on at least one interview as Mr Ash claimed to have been taken to Amsterdam several times to be abused by paedophiles including convicted child killer Sidney Cooke.

He says Cooke, now 84, made him film the abuse of another young boy.

Mr Ash also told police he was abused by a famous celebrity.

He said: 'This particular person was able to get youngsters into glitzy nightclubs in the West End. After one evening he invited me and a young girl back to his house where he made us have sex before joining in.'

A spokesman from the Met Police said the force would not be commenting on the allegations.
