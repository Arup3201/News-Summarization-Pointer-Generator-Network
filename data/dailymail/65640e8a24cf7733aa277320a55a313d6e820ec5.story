Paul Ince 
was a much-talked about footballer during his time playing for 
Manchester United, Liverpool and England - and now he has become an 
internet sensation for his waving technique.

While 
appearing on ITV's All Star Mr and Mrs on Wednesday with wife Claire, 
Ince was introduced by presenter Phillip Schofield and he performed a 
windscreen-wiper wave to the camera with an over-zealous smile for close
 to six seconds.

The video has been turned into a Vine and has been shared many times on social networking sites.

Ince revealed how much he loved chocolate chip ice cream during the programme.

He has been married to wife Claire for 24 years after they met at school.

The now 46-year-old was first named England captain in 1993 against the USA in Foxboro,
 Massachusetts and he was the first black manager to wear the armband.

Ince represented his country 53 times, scoring twice, and retired from international football after Englandâ€™s Euro 2000 exit.

The
 ex-midfielder started his career at West Ham United before moving to 
Manchester United, Inter Milan, Liverpool, Middlesbrough, Wolverhampton 
Wanderers, Swindon Town and Macclesfield Town.

He
 went on to become a manager with Blackburn, Macclesfield, Milton Keynes Dons and, most 
recently, Blackpool.

His son, Tom Ince, is an England U21 international who has played for Liverpool, Notts County, Blackpool and Crystal Palace.
