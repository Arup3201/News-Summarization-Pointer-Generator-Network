The teenager behind a Washington state school shooting last month that left five people dead 'turned dark' the week before he opened fire, texting friends and family threats and messages about his own funeral, and writing to one girl: 'Bang bang I'm dead.'

Moments before Jaylen Fryberg, 15, shot his fellow students - all friends - on October 24 in the Marysville Pilchuck High School cafeteria, he texted more than a dozen relatives, describing what he wanted to wear at his funeral and who should get his personal possessions, a detective's search warrant affidavit has revealed.

The boy asked relatives to apologize to the families of his friends 'who get caught up in the (expletive) tomorrow' - referring to the day after the shooting. 

He also sent texts in the days leading up to the shooting to a female friend saying she will regret not talking to him and that he has 'set a date' for his funeral.

Killer: Five teenagers, including the perpetrator, were killedat Marysville Pilchuck High School in Washington on October 24 when popular freshman student Jaylen Fryberg (pictured) opened fire at a group of friends

Lured: Jaylen Fryberg texted his five closest friends saying to meet him in the cafeteria where he shot them. A detective's search warrant affidavit has now revealed the ominous texts he sent in the lead up to the shooting

The popular teen - who was named a prince on the school's homecoming court one week before the killing spree - fatally shot four friends he had invited to lunch and wounded a fifth teen before killing himself.

The victims were Gia Soriano, Zoe Galasso and Shaylee Chuckulnaskit, all 14, and Andrew Fryberg, 15.

All were shot in the head. 

Nate Hatch, 14, was shot in the jaw and is recovering.

Andrew Fryberg and Hatch are the shooter's cousins.

Investigators have found no evidence to support a rumor that students had expressed concerns about Jaylen Fryberg to school authorities before the shooting, police spokeswoman Shari Ireton said Wednesday.

The Daily Herald of Everett obtained the Everett police detective's affidavit, which provided details of the boy's last text messages, but not their full contents. 

The detective had been seeking a judge's permission to examine the boy's cellphone. 

Multiple agencies are investigating the shooting and are sifting through hundreds of text messages and social media posts.

Only survivor: Nate Hatch was the only member of the group to recover from his injuries

While the boy had publicly posted some angry messages on social media starting in late July, his posts otherwise were 'pretty normal,' the detective wrote. 

The change began October 18.

Detectives learned that he had been upset by something that happened between him and a 15-year-old identified in the affidavit only by her initials and described as a 'close friend.'

Investigators know what happened between the two but decided against including specifics in the search warrant documents to protect her identity, court papers said.

Previous reports have suggested he was upset over 14-year-old victim Zoe Galasso, who had recently started dating his cousin Andrew Fryberg.

The shooter's Twitter feed was full of vague, anguished postings, like 'It won't last ... It'll never last,' and 'I should have listened. ... You were right ... The whole time you were right.' 

On October 18, Fryberg texted: 'Ohk (sic) well don't bother coming to my funeral.' 

The girl stopped responding and ignored other text messages. 

On October 22, the boy texted: 'I set the date. Hopefully you regret not talking to me', 'You have no idea what I'm talking about. But you will,' and 'Bang bang I'm dead.'

When the friend asked Fryberg to stop, he replied: 'No. You don't care. I don't care.'

When she stopped responding, Fryberg tried to reach her through another friend. 

The morning of October 24, Fryberg used Facebook to send that friend a picture of a gun sitting between his legs, court papers said. 

Respect: Flowers, newspapers and written tributes are seen pinned outside Marysville-Pilchuck High School

He told the friend to have the girl 'call me before I do this.'

That message was sent minutes before the shooting started.

The detective met with two of Fryberg's uncles the day of the shooting, the Daily Herald reported. 

One man said he and 13 other relatives received a text from the boy minutes before the gunfire. 

The message was titled: 'My Funeral (expletive).'

Detectives later searched the boy's room.

'My hope was that we could find a note or something that would help explain what happened,' the detective wrote. 

'Nothing of evidentiary value was located in Jaylen's room.'
