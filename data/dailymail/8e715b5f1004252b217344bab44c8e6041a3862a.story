Brendan Rodgers did not want to expose Raheem Sterling to the coarse climes of Sunderland, where temperatures barely touched 3C and wild winds whipped litter around the stadium.

Instead, the player he believes will fire Liverpool to the top four was in Jamaica, relaxing and posting selfies amid the 30C surrounds of his ‘winter break’.

Rodgers has made an exception with Sterling, allowing him to enjoy a 10-day rest period while his team-mates have negotiated an FA Cup tie at League Two AFC Wimbledon and a narrow victory at Sunderland.

Sunderland have won just once at the Stadium of Light all season and have the worst home record (nine points) in the Premier League. 

But the Reds boss sees the 20-year-old as an exceptional talent, and one which will make the difference in his side’s quest for Champions League football.

‘Raheem was brilliant in the second half of last season. If we put him and (Daniel) Sturridge in that team now, with that way of working, it will be fantastic,’ said Rodgers, whose side have lost just one in nine in the Premier League and are up to eighth.

‘We are aiming for the top four, absolutely.’ Sterling was back on Merseyside on, and Rodgers will be expecting the England forward to reward him for keeping to the promise he made in the summer.

‘After the World Cup I felt he needed a break but we had the Champions League and a lot of games,’ he explained. 

‘We had a plan that this was going to be the best time, after the Christmas period. 

‘He will come back now and mentality it will freshen him up. It is not just the physical fitness but the mental fitness that he needs. 

‘We have put so much on him since he came into the team as a 17-year-old. He has not had a break and has progressed through to being a full international player.’

It was perhaps best for sorry Sunderland that Sterling was not at the Stadium of Light. For the crisp packets and sweet wrappers did not distract from the rubbish they served up on the pitch, especially during the first half. It was easy for Liverpool.

The only surprise was that they did not add to Lazar Markovic’s ninth-minute opener, a close-range poke after a forceful burst into the penalty area. Emerging as the match-winner, however, at least afforded the Serb the headlines which will be hoped serve as a confidence boost.

The 20-year-old has struggled to impact since his £20million arrival from Benfica, but Rodgers said: ‘He is a top young talent. It shows more what a difficult league this is for any player to come in, let alone a very young player. Then add the fact that he is coming to one of the biggest clubs in the world, so it takes time.

‘But a lot of our young players are starting to bed into our philosophy and the way we play. You will see them develop and come on a lot in the next six months.’ 

He added: ‘I had a chat with Lazar a while ago about his aggression and he got sent off in the next game. But I want him to be aggressive with and without the ball. He is a talent which is why he is at Liverpool and his performance was very good.’

The same cannot be said about the hosts, whose display was lacking in energy and invention. They were arguably better after Liam Bridcutt was sent off early in the second half following a soft second booking for a trip on Emre Can, but they never truly threatened parity.

Poyet is frustrated that his team are not playing out the identity he has tried to impose and was alarmed at the manner in which they stood off the visitors.

When asked about their lack of urgency and aggression, he said: ‘Only one Sunderland team has shown those characteristics – the team of Kevin Phillips and Quinn. 

‘The rest of the teams of Sunderland did not have any characteristics. They were rubbish. They were playing for relegation and suffering. I am trying something. But we are miles away to a point that it worries me a little bit.’ 

Worry, however, is not an emotion troubling Rodgers right now. Rather, his mood on a windswept and chilly Wearside was one of excitement. Liverpool’s season might just be hotting up.
