The convertible red Bentley that took pride of place in Elton John's Cold War hit Nikita has emerged for sale with an estimate of £70,000.

Bought by Sir Elton  from new, the plush Bentley Continental was used for the video of the 1985 hit single about a beautiful female Russian border guard called Nikita.

It featured Sir Elton sat in the luxury motor taking photos of Nikita from afar before making several failed attempts to drive it through her checkpoint.

The song, from the album Ice on Fire, was a number one around the world and charted at number three in the UK. The album was Sir Elton's first in almost 10 years and despite Nikita's success was not critically acclaimed.

Sir Elton bought the Bentley  in February 1985, and it appeared in the music video with it's original B120 WYM registration plate. 

He went onto change the registration for personalised plates of B20 ELT, which remain on the vehicle to this day, before he sold the Bentley some time after.

The singer bought the red convertible in 1985 which took a starring role in the video for Nikita - which reached number three in the UK music charts - before he sold it sometime later

In 2008 the Bentley was bought by a classic car collector from Venice, Italy, who has kept it in top condition.

It boasts a huge 6.7-litre V8 engine capable of propelling the car to a top speed in excess of 120mph, and has less than 40,000 miles on the clock.

Painted in a fetching 'Tudor red', it has a red-piped beige leather interior and matching hood as well as a walnut coloured dashboard.

It is being sold with a UK registration document and the original stamped service book showing Elton John as the first owner.

The Bentley is tipped to fetch £70,000 when it goes under the hammer at auctioneers Bonhams.

Gregor Wenner, a motoring specialist at Bonhams, said: 'This is a fantastic example of a Bentley engineered during the brands mid-eighties revival period.

'The luxury marque attracted the interest of renowned motoring enthusiast and celebrated musician, Sir Elton John, who purchased the car new and later used it for the music video of his 1985 hit song Nikita, which reached number one in many European countries and number three in the UK singles chart.'

The auction will take place in Paris on February 5.
