It's not easy being one of the world's richest men and top philanthropists.

But with the fame and fortune of billionaire Stewart Rahr are numerous stories of tantrums, violence and pay-offs - all of which he denies.

Rahr, one of the world's richest men who sold his pharmaceutical supplier company Kinray for $1.3billion in 2010, is known for his mountain of photos with top celebrities, including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Mark Wahlberg, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix.

The New York Post reported that Rahr was willing to hand over a million dollars in an effort to get accepted at ultra-exclusive Sebonack Golf Club in Southampton, Long Island.

Security aficionado Bo Dietl told the Post: 'The guy was dying to get in there. So he actually handed me a blank check for a million dollars for the owner to give to a charity of his choice. I told [club founder Michael Pascucci], "Don’t let this douchebag in."'

Dietl added: 'I've known him for 20 years. He buys everybody.'

But Rahr tells a different story, saying that 'he came to me eight months later and wanted the check back. I said, "Forget it."'

Another incident stemmed from a dispute between Rahr and professional gambler RJ Cipriani.

Allegations: Professional gambler RJ Cipriani and his wife Greice Santo, have accused Rahr of trying to force his way into her hotel room

Cipriani told the Post that he was flying to Las Vegas recently with his wife Greice Santo and Rahr, and Rahr promised to look after his wife after he was unexpectedly called away to Los Angeles.

Santo claimed that Rahr grew angry with her after she refused to meet him and friends for dinner at the Wynn Hotel in Las Vegas.

She said that Rahr tried to force his way into her room at the hotel, and would not leave when she asked him to.

But Rahr again denied any wrongdoing, telling the Post: 'I tried to help the guy. I wish I’d never met him.'

Last week, it was reported that Rahr pulled a gun on an elevator operator at New York's Trump Tower after an altercation with the man.

When police arrived, Rahr was found to have a gun, which was confiscated by officers. He  claimed it wasn't loaded.

Earlier this month, Rahr was banned from top New York restaurant Nobu after the staff said that he allegedly threatened to kill the manager when he didn't get his favorite table.

Rahr reportedly sent a email of complaint to Nobu owner Drew Nieporent.

Rahr admits having a disagreement with a female manager but denied threatening to kill her after she ignored his phone call, according to the Post.

The paper reports that after the face-to-face confrontation with the manager, he sent a caps-locked tirade to Nieporent and CC'ed a group of his famous friends including Mark Wahlberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Alicia Keys, Andre Agassi and Joaquin Phoenix.

Three other recipients have some political pull, including NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, Rahr's 'buddy' Donald Trump, and Robert DeNiro who co-owns the restaurant chain with Nieporent.

The dispute stems from an incident where the 66-year-old allegedly got into a verbal altercation with restaurant manager Sharon Hofstetter when Rahr tried to get his favorite table on the night of his wife's surprise birthday party.

He reportedly walked up to an occupied
table and asked the group who was dining there to move so that he could
have 'his' table.

A bartender told the paper that the group refused and he offered to pay their bill if they would agree.

Rahr, who calls himself 'Stewie Rah 
Rah- the No. 1 King of Fun', then left an irate message for Hofstetter, 
who was not at the restaurant at the time of the interaction.

She did not call him back immediately so he went to the restaurant on 57th Street to have it out with her in person. 

'He called me the c-word and said he would kill me,' Hofstetter told The Post.

Rahr claimed that Hofstetter was supposed to meet him at his office to plan the party in question, so he went to the restaurant to give her a piece of his mind.

'I told her "I can't stand you. You're despicable." Did I curse at her or threaten to kill her? No true- please. I would never say that,' Rahr told the paper.

Feeling like his message may not be clear, Rahr decided to send the email to Nieporent and copy his A-list pals.

'I GUESS THAT U R MUCH TOO BUSY TO 
CALL BACK AN UPSET CUSTOMER. I HAD TOLD U THAT I HAD A MAJOR PROBLEM 
& A VERY UNCOMFORTABLE EXPERIENCE CONCERNING A SURPRISE PARTY FOR A 
VERY VERY CLOSE FRIEND THIS PAST WEDS,' he wrote in the email.

Rahr,
who owned drug manufacturer Kinray until he sold it for $1.3billion in 
2010, went on to talk about his wealth in the email, using it as an 
unexpected way to rub his business savvy in Nieporent's face.

Upset: Stewart Rahr took issue with how he was treated at Nobu57 in Manhattan

'I
HAD ONLY 3 employees & revenues of only $40,000... WHEN I RECENTLY 
SOLD MY company last year I EMPLOYED almost 2,000 employees n REVENUES 
of $5,000,000,000 (thats what 5 BILLION (W AN 'B' AS IN BOY NOT AN 'M' 
AS IN MAN...' he wrote in the angry- and typo-laden- email.

Now, Rahr is no longer welcome at any of the 25 international Nobu locations.

Given
his affinity for self tanner and trademark uniform of purple t-shirts 
and yellow Ray Ban sunglasses, it would be easy to spot him if he tried 
to sneak in.

This is far from the first time that Rahr has used his connections to make a point, as he was described in a New York Observer profile of showing off his hundreds of photos with various celebrities.

And
he has no problem expressing his distaste for others: He openly 
bad-mouthed Tiger Woods, calling him 'the most selfish guy I know out of
the 500 celebrities on this wall', and had a PR back-and-forth over a 
slight to comedian George Lopez.

But
others in the celebrity world paint a different picture of Rahr, a man 
they say donates generously and has made a huge impact on the charities 
close to the rich and famous.

Among
them is Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, who told the Post that he 
has 'nothing but great things to say about [Rahr] and his generosity. 
Stewie Rah Rah has got a soft spot for those in need.'
