With her blonde hair, long limbs and Amazonian physique, German model Veruschka was the Kate Moss of the 1960s.

Now rare photographs of the model, taken during the early days of her career, have been released in a new book, Veruschka.

In one dramatic black and white shot, the willowy model smoulders in a delicate beaded black dress, while one simple portrait shows off her enormous blue eyes to maximum advantage.

Striking: The 6ft 3" beauty became one of the most iconic models of the 1960s

The new book, which includes some of the most iconic photographs ever taken of the model, is the result of a collaboration between LA-based photographer David Willis and Veruschka, now 74, herself.

Along with musings and anecdotes from Veruschka, real name Vera Gottliebe Anna, Countess von Lehndorff, the text also includes interviews with some of the 20th century's greatest fashion names, among them Diana Vreeland and Grace Mirabella.

Although both Vreeland and Mirabella had fascinating careers, most interesting of all is Veruschka's own story.

Born in East Prussia in 1939, the future supermodel endured a dangerous childhood. Her father, Count Heinrich von Lehndorff, joined the German resistance, reportedly after witnessing Jewish children being beaten and murdered.

Later, Count von Lehndorff was executed for his involvement in the 20th July plot - a bid to assassinate Hitler in his East Prussia field headquarters which were located in the grounds of the von Lehndorff family home.

Afterwards, her mother was imprisoned and the four children were put into a camp for children of resistance fighters. By the time the war ended, Veruschka and her family had lost everything.

Homeless, she and what was left of her family drifted around Europe. Eventually, Veruschka found herself in Florence and hoped to become an artist, but all that changed when she was scouted at the age of 20 by Italian photographer, Ugo Muglas.

Glamorous: Veruschka eventually commanded modelling fees of up to $10,000 (Â£6,000) a day

Must read: The new book is a joint collaboration between photographer David Willis and Veruschka herself

He took her to Paris, where she was introduced to Eileen Ford, head of the Ford Modelling Agency, who immediately spotted her potential.

From there, her rise was swift and lucrative, with the model commanding fees of up to $10,000 (Â£6,000) at the peak of her career.

She also appeared in several films, among them cult 1966 film Blow Up, and most recently in 2006 Bond film, Casino Royale.

And despite being well into her 70s, she hasn't given up her modelling career either, making a guest appearance at Melbourne Fashion Festival in 2000 and taking a spin on the Giles catwalk during London Fashion week in 2010.
