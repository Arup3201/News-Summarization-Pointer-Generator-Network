Scientists and art experts have found a hidden painting beneath one of Pablo Picasso's first masterpieces, The Blue Room, using advances in infrared imagery to reveal a bow-tied man with his face resting on his hand.

Now the question that conservators at The Phillips Collection in Washington hope to answer is simply: Who is he?

It's a mystery that's fuelling new research about the 1901 painting created early in Picasso's career while he was working in Paris at the start of his distinctive blue period of melancholy subjects.

What lies beneath: The Blue Room, one of Pablo Picasso's first masterpieces, under a microscope at The Phillips Collection, Washington. Scientists and art experts have found a hidden painting beneath the painting

Curators and conservators revealed 
their findings for the first time to The Associated Press last week. 
Over the past five years, experts from The Phillips Collection, National
 Gallery of Art, Cornell University and Delaware's Winterthur Museum 
have developed a clearer image of the mystery picture under the surface.
 It's a portrait of an unknown man painted in a vertical composition by 
one of the 20th century's great artists.

'It's really one of those moments that really makes what you do special,' said Patricia Favero, the conservator at The Phillips Collection who pieced together the best infrared image yet of the man's face.

'The second reaction was, "well, who is it?" We're still working on answering that question.'

Who is he? Patricia Favero, associate conservator at The Phillips Collection, points to the image found beneath The Blue Room, a bow-tied man with his face resting on his hand, with three rings on his fingers

The Blue Room beneath the microscope: Conservators long suspected there might be something under the surface of The Blue Room, which has been part of The Phillips Collection in Washington since 1927

In 2008, improved infrared imagery 
revealed for the first time a man's bearded face resting on his hand 
with three rings on his fingers. He's dressed in a jacket and bow tie.

A
 technical analysis confirmed the hidden portrait is a work Picasso 
likely painted just before The Blue Room, curators said. After the 
portrait was discovered, conservators have been using other technology 
to scan the painting for further insights.

Conservators
 long suspected there might be something under the surface of The Blue 
Room, which has been part of The Phillips Collection in Washington since
 1927. Brushstrokes on the piece clearly don't match the composition 
that depicts a woman bathing in Picasso's studio. A conservator noted 
the odd brushstrokes in a 1954 letter, but it wasn't until the 1990s 
that an x-ray of the painting first revealed a fuzzy image of something 
under the picture. It wasn't clear, though, that it was a portrait.

'When he had an idea, you know, he just had to get it down and realise it': Curator Susan Behrends Frank told the AP that Picasso could not afford to buy new canvasses every time he had an idea he wanted to pursue

'When
 he had an idea, you know, he just had to get it down and realise it,' 
curator Susan Behrends Frank told the AP, revealing Picasso had 
hurriedly painted over another complete picture.

'He could not afford to
 acquire new canvasses every time he had an idea that he wanted to 
pursue. He worked sometimes on cardboard because canvas was so much more
 expensive.'

Scholars are 
researching who this man might be and why Picasso painted him. They have
 ruled out the possibility that it was a self-portrait.

One possible 
figure is the Paris art dealer Ambrose Villard who hosted Picasso's 
first show in 1901. But there's no documentation and no clues left on 
the canvas, so the research continues.

Masterpiece: Curators are planning the first exhibit focused on The Blue Room as a seminal work in Picasso's career for 2017. It will also examine the revelation of the man's portrait beneath the painting

Favero
 has been collaborating with other experts to scan the painting with 
multi-spectral imaging technology and x-ray fluorescence intensity 
mapping to try to identify and map the colors of the hidden painting. 
They would like to recreate a digital image approximating the colors 
Picasso used.

engagement with other artists.

For now, The Blue Room is part of a tour to South Korea through early 2015 as the research continues.

Hidden treasures: Dorothy Kosinski, the director of The Phillips Collection, said new knowledge about Picasso and his process can be discovered through the high-tech collaboration among museums

Hidden
 pictures have been found under other important Picasso paintings. A 
technical analysis of La Vie at the Cleveland Museum of Art revealed 
Picasso significantly reworked the painting's composition. And 
conservators found a portrait of a mustached man beneath Picasso's 
painting Woman Ironing at the Guggenheim Museum in Manhattan.

Dorothy
 Kosinski, the director of The Phillips Collection, said new knowledge 
about Picasso and his process can be discovered through the high-tech 
collaboration among museums.

'Our
 audiences are hungry for this. It's kind of detective work. It's giving
 them a doorway of access that I think enriches, maybe adds mystery, 
while allowing them to be part of a piecing together of a puzzle,' she 
said.

'The more we can understand, the greater our appreciation is of its
 significance in Picasso's life.'
