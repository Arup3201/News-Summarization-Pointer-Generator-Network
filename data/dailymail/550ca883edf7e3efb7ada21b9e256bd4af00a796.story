Stuart Lancaster insisted his England side is on track ahead of next year’s World Cup following a forward-dominated win over Australia at Twickenham.

Ben Morgan and Courtney Lawes shone as England recorded their first win in seven attempts over the southern hemisphere’s big-three sides to leave Australia without a Test-match victory on their European tour.

George Ford kicked 16 points while No 8 Morgan claimed the man-of-the-match award and afterwards Lancaster hailed his side’s powerful performance which went some way towards easing the pain of their opening QBE series defeats to New Zealand and South Africa.

Asked if he thought his injury-hit side were on course ahead of the World Cup, Lancaster said:

‘Absolutely. It is always difficult going into an autumn series playing the world champions with limited preparation time.

‘We felt we competed well. We felt in the South Africa game we actually generated the opportunities for them rather than the other way round.

‘We have not got everything right by any stretch of the imagination, there’s still a lot of work to do.

The England scrum will cause Michael Cheika many sleepless nights in the coming months 

‘But it feels better having won the last game. In certain areas the progression of key players has been a real bonus for us. We have got seven British Lions missing at the moment and they are all getting back fit now so progress up front, the scrum was very good.

‘Look at the quality of the players missing from the pack: (Joe) Launchbury, (Geoff) Parling, (Tom) Youngs, (Billy) Vunipola, (Alex) Corbisiero, (Dan) Cole, (Tom) Croft. What’s pleased me most is the emergence of the Kieran Brookes and the Matt Mullan and the contribution that George Kruis has made.’

The packed Twickenham crowd paid a moving tribute to fallen Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes before the game but Australia were unable to deliver the victory their nation craved as England completely dominated the set-piece 10 months before the sides will meet again in the World Cup pool.

‘We wanted to make a statement in the final game of the campaign and I think we did that. It was a strong performance and we got the result,’ Morgan said.

‘It was important to sign off with a win and good performance. It will help us build into the Six Nations and gives everyone a positive feeling for the next few months.

‘The Six Nations is the last big tournament before the World Cup so it’s crucial we keep improving and moving forward.’
