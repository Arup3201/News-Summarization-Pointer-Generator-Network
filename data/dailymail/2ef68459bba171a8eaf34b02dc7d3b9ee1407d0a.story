Denied: Mary Stanton has been refused life-saving chemotherapy

A grandmother has been ‘left to die’ by the NHS after being refused life-saving chemotherapy - because her cancer is not ‘exceptional’ enough.

After waiting eight months for the treatment using ‘anti-cancer’ drug Ofatumumab, Mary Stanton, 69, was told she was not eligible for it and there was nothing more doctors could do for her.

The grandmother of four says she was given no explanation from the Cancer Drugs Fund – which is overseen by NHS England - except that her condition was not ‘exceptional’ enough.

She was given the devastating news by her oncology consultant, Dr Richard Murrin, at Birmingham’s City Hospital, who was also baffled by the decision and vowed to appeal it.

Mrs Stanton who was already ‘distraught’ with the news, was then handed a ‘My Life’ pamphlet by a hospital nurse advising her on what provisions to make when she becomes ‘too ill’ to carry out her wishes.

Now Mrs Stanton - who is a full-time carer for her daughter Angela, 48, who has Down’s Syndrome and Crohn’s Disease - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for NHS England to change their mind.

But if their appeal doesn't work, she said she will have no choice but to sell her house to pay for the £40,000 treatment.

‘It's the only option I'll have,’ she said. 'But then where would I go? I'd have nothing left.'

‘After I retired seven years ago I looked after my daughter.

'I saved the NHS thousands doing that and now they can't be bothered to fund my treatment.'

She questioned how she can be refused a potentially life-saving treatment when some doctors are living ‘champagne lifestyles’ and being paid as much as £1,500 to work in A&E units at night – as revealed in the Daily Mail on Saturday.

Speaking from her home in Nechells, Birmingham, yesterday she said: ‘It feels as though I have been given a death sentence.

‘I have been left dangling and keep getting fobbed off. No one is giving me any answers.’

Despair: Mrs Stanton - who is a full-time carer for her daughter Angela, who has Down's Syndrome - can only wait while she and her doctor fight for NHS England to change their mind

Mrs
 Stanton, who worked since the age of 18 as a barmaid and shop assistant
 until she retired, said her doctor recently secured funding for another
 patient with very similar circumstances.

Ofatumumab, or Arzerra,  is a treatment used for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia when the cancer drugs fludarabine and alemtuzumab are no longer working.

The drug is what's known as a type of monoclonal antibody.

Monoclonal antibodies are made in the lab and used for targeted cancer treatment. They recognise and find specific proteins on the outside of cancer cells.

Ofatumumab targets part of a protein called CD20 on the surface of the chronic lymphocytic leukaemic cells.

The ofatumumab sticks to all the CD20 proteins it finds. Then the cells of the immune system pick out the marked cells and kill them.

‘It feels diabolical. I don’t feel like I’m ready to die.

‘How can they give one patient with the same condition treatment, but not me?’

Having already endured a 14-month wait for the drug, and with her health quickly declining, Mrs Stanton has endured two blood transfusions in the past three weeks in an attempt to keep her immune system strong.

She has been previously treated with three rounds of chemotherapy, but could benefit from Ofatumumab - also known as Azerra - as it can help patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, when other drugs are not working.

The mother of three said her main concern is for her daughter and mother who rely on her care and support.

‘I
 have had to stop looking after Angela because of this, and that will 
cost the NHS money as she has had to go into a residential home,’ she 
said.

‘I have people who rely on me, my mother also has dementia, the situation makes me so scared for them if I'm left to simply die.

‘You see all these people who do nothing, and the people who come into this country brand new and they get treatment on the NHS.

Happier times: Mrs Stanton on her 50th birthday. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma seven years ago - and says the latest decision feels like 'a death sentence'

‘Then I come along, having funded it all my life and they say no and leave me to die.’

Mrs Stanton said Dr Mullin has approached the drug companies directly to see if they will give his patient the treatment on 'compassionate grounds'.

‘If my doctors didn't think I had a chance they would have told me, they would not be fighting so hard now,’ she said.

‘Dr Murrin has been a great support and has done all he can to try to secure the funding, but there's only so much he can do.’

A
 spokesman for NHS England said: 'Like any treatment, the decision on 
whether to approve the use of a treatment from the Cancer Drugs Fund is 
always based on clinical evidence of its effectiveness and clinical 
benefit for each patient.

Mrs Stanton aged 33, with her son Richard. She now fears that without funding for her life-saving treatment, she will be forced to sell her house

'Each case is considered on an individual basis and has to meet set criteria, which includes exceptional clinical circumstances.

'When the decision is taken that a treatment is not of benefit for an individual we understand how distressing this can be. The decision is, however, based on whether the treatment will be effective and benefit the individual.

'There is an opportunity for the patient and their clinician to appeal against the process.'

A spokeswoman from the Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust said: 'We are reluctant to comment on individual cases.

'However we can confirm that we have applied so far unsuccessfully for exceptional funding. We continue to discuss options with our patient, and apologise unreservedly if discussing her care created an impression that there was only one option.'
