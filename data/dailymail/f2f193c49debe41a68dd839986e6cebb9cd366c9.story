A south African man has become the first person in the world to be convicted of killing a great white shark after he hooked one while fishing from the shore.

Leon Bekker, of George, Western Cape, 
pleaded guilty to contravention of the Marine Living Resources Act which
includes attempting to kill, disturb or be in possession of a white 
shark without a permit.

Bekker pointed out that he had no 
idea at first that he'd hooked a great white shark but he pleaded guilty so 
as not to waste the court's time.

But in a landmark decision Mossel Bay Magistrate's Court handed him a fine of R120,000 (£8,550)  or a 12-month prison sentence, suspended for five years.

The unprecedented case is the only great white shark conviction in a South African court to date - the first country to impose legislation in protecting great white sharks.

Great white sharks have been protected 
in South African waters since 1991 and no person is permitted to catch 
them, or even to attempt to catch them.

Penalty: In a landmark ruling, Bekker was fined £8,500 under the Marine Living Resources Act

But for years anglers who landed the sharks were able to successfully argue that they had not been targeting great whites.

Environmentalists believe the ruling 
sets a new precedent in that anyone using heavy-duty fishing tackle in 
an area where white sharks are known to inhabit is effectively
breaking the law.

Shark scientist Ryan Johnson, who appeared as an expert witness in the case, welcomed the verdict.

He told the Cape Times: 'A lot of law
enforcement officers were reluctant to prosecute because they knew it 
was difficult to prove the anglers had targeted white sharks.

'This prosecutor analysed the law and
said as anglers fishing with heavy equipment in an area known for white
sharks, they would have a reasonable expectation of catching great 
white sharks, and so just by fishing with that equipment in that area 
they are in effect breaking the law.'

Photographs of Bekker giving a 
thumbs-up sign after hauling the shark onto the rocks, sparked an angry
outcry after they were published in the paper two years ago.

However photographs of anglers posing with dead great whites are not uncommon and there is an on-going illegal trade in great white shark body parts such as jaws, which fetch a very high price.

Department of Agriculture, Forestry 
and Fisheries spokesman Lionel Adendorf said: 'This is the first great 
white shark case and conviction in any South African court. We are 
certain that the sentence will serve as a deterrent.'

Although great white sharks have been protected in South Africa since 1991, there is evidence to suggest that they continue to be targeted by recreational fisherman as a trophy species

The World Wildlife Fund welcomed the 
ruling. Spokesman Dr Eleanor Yeld Hutchings said: 'This is the first 
legal case, and conviction, around the catching of a white shark in 
South Africa.

'For 
authorities to take such clear action is an excellent indication of 
their commitment to upholding protected species status.'

The not inconsiderable sentencing of Leon Bekker will hopefully be a deterrent to these practices in South Africa.

As far as I am aware, this is also a world first in terms of prosecution for harming a white shark.'

No person is allowed to trade in, or have possession of any parts of a white shark, even their teeth, without a permit.

In Australia, while Great White 
Sharks are also protected species in Australian waters, legislators have
recently approved a plan to kill sharks that venture too close to 
people in the water.

There 
were five fatal shark attacks in Western Australia in the past year, 
with many residents calling for a more aggressive shark management 
plan.

South Africa sees it's fair share of great white attacks. one particular hotspot is Capetown's Fish Hoek beach which has seen three attacks in the last eight years.

In September last year, British tourist Michael Cohen was attacked with a
shark biting off his right leg above the knee and part of his left leg.

That followed two fatal attacks including that of Zimbabwean tourist Lloyd Skinner who was pulled undewater and dragged out to sea in 2010. Only his diving goggles were found.

And in November 2004, a 77-year-old Tyna Webb, was attacked and killed by a shark while doing the backstroke.

City officials are now considering installing a 355-metre long net across a stretch of  the beach to create a safe swimming area.
