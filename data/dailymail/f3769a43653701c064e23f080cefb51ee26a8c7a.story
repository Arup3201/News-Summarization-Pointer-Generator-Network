At first glance, these pretty dresses look like just the sort of summer attire you’d have hanging up in your wardrobe.

They are an off-white, almost grey colour (a big trend this season) and are in frilly, boho-style that has become so popular.

But, on close inspection, you will see that the lovely dresses are, in fact, made of marble – sculpted over eight months by Edinburgh-based artist Alasdair Thomson.

Good enough to wear: This gorgeous dress, titled Elizabeth, is actually made of marble

So pretty: The Carrie dress took months to make. 'There are four more as yet unpublished garments,' says artist Alasdair Thomson

His Identity collection, as seen on his website, includes six dresses, each named after each given a woman’s name.

Aisling
 is a loose-fitting-style smock sculpture. It looks exactly like a boho-style dress which was a huge trend in the
 mid-noughties.

Greta is a short dress with thin straps, frills on the skirt and a belt carved over where the waist would be.

They're the tops! Amazing marble sculptures by Edinburgh-based artist Alasdair Thomson

Lucy is more of a smock, with incredibly 
intrinsic frills around the neckline. Carrie is a short-sleeved dress, 
Hannah another smock and Elizabeth a beautiful short dress.

Alasdair
 used Carrara marble to make the sculptures, which he has been working 
on for eight months. The white or blue-grey material is popular for 
building and sculptures.

‘These
 works take varying lengths of time, depending on size and complexity, 
but let's just say I've made 10 of these dresses since last September,’ 
Alasdair tells Mail Online.

'I'm flattered that people really like this work,' says Alasdair of his works of art such as the Greta pictured here. 'It really resonates with people, which is lovely. People identify with them'

‘There are four more as yet unpublished garments that will also be included in the collection.

‘I'm flattered that people really like this work. It really resonates with people, which is lovely - people identify with them.’

Alasdair
 achieved his degree in Art History from the University of Edinburgh in 
2004, and his diploma in sculpture from the Senese Scuola Edile in Siena
 in 2010.

He won the 
People's Choice Award at Edinburgh's Royal Scottish Academy 2013 Open 
Exhibition, and is the recipient of a residency with the Carving Studio 
& Sculpture Centre in Rutland, VT, due to be undertaken in the 
summer of 2014.
