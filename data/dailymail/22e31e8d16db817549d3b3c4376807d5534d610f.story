Logan Crawford, 7, died when he fell from cliffs in Ballycastle, Northern Ireland on Sunday

A seven-year-old boy has died after falling from cliffs off the coast of Northern Ireland, police said.

Logan Crawford was last seen playing with friends near to a seaside caravan park near Ballycastle in County Antrim.

A major search operation, involving two RNLI lifeboats, a police helicopter and a helicopter from nearby RAF Prestwick, was triggered after the child was reported missing.

The boy was airlifted to Causeway Hospital in Coleraine after he was found at the foot of the Ballycastle cliffs.

He later died of his injuries, the Belfast Coastguard confirmed.

A Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) spokesman said the force was investigating.

They added: 'Shortly before 7.15pm, it was reported that the boy fell from a cliff into the sea.

'Northern Ireland Coastguard recovered the boy from the sea and he was airlifted to a nearby hospital, but later died as a result of his injuries.

A spokeswoman from the Belfast Coastguard said: 'About twenty past seven last night we were alerted by both the police and the ambulance service that a child was missing in the vicinity of Silver Cliffs caravan park in Ballycastle and having possibly fallen off the cliff.

'We had a large multi-agency response initiated with specialist cliff-trained coastguard rescue teams from Ballycastle and Coleraine, lifeboats from Portrush and Red Bay a Royal Navy rescue helicopter, police and ambulance personnel.

'The area was thoroughly covered by our rescue teams and it was the Royal Navy rescue helicopter from the air who spotted the child at the bottom of the cliff.

'They initiated their winch procedures, 
put their winchman down at the scene, lifted the child into the 
helicopter and transported him to the Causeway Hospital in Coleraine.'
