Swathed in a ruffled cream gown and a silk bow, he could be the latest addition to the Royal Family.

But this creepy Prince George lookalike is actually a porcelain doll.

The hand-painted creation, designed for distribution firm Bradford Exchange, is on sale for £129.95.

And it looks eerily similar to the future King - with detailed features, fair hair and moveable limbs.

The 20-inch doll is is even dressed in a replica of the gown worn by Prince George at his christening at the historic Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in October.

The toy - dubbed the Prince of Cambridge Commemorative Baby Doll - was created by artist Fiorenza Biancheri for the company in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.

The first batch of the dolls has already sold out - with Ms Biancheri currently working on a second batch for diehard fans of the royal family.

Jane Smith, 44, from Swansea, said she was planning to purchase one of the sinister-looking dolls as a late 'Christmas present' to herself.

'I love the royal family very much,' she said. 'They make our country what it is - proud and extremely envied.

'He will be an absolute delight and a welcome addition to our family.'

A Bradford Exchange spokesman said the real Prince George - born on July 22 - is 'destined to captivate generations for royal watchers'.

She added: 'The interest we have received for the Prince of Cambridge Commemorative Baby Doll has been immense - so much so that we have had to make sure we will have enough hand-crafted dolls in January to meet the demand.

'Fiorenza Biancheri's signature award-winning style provides the beautifully sculpted, exact likeness of Prince George.

'This is a Christmas item to honour and celebrate the momentous Royal birth of Prince George.'

Each doll is hand-numbered and comes with a matching Certificate of Authenticity form.
