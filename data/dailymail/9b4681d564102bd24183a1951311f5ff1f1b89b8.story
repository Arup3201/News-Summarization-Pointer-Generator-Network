French president Francois Hollande has opened-up about his troubled love life, speaking of his 'ordeals and pain', following the publication of a book by his former girlfriend that has further dented his sinking reputation.

At a press conference yesterday, Mr Hollande reluctantly, and briefly, responded to questions about the bestselling book by journalist Valérie Trierweiler.

The book portrayed the president as a power-crazy hypocrite, who pretends to dislike the rich, but in fact loathes the poor. It was published after Mr Hollande and Ms Trierweiler broke-up following revelations he had a liaison with actress Julie Gavet.

French President Francois Hollande, seen here earlier this month, has finally addressed 'my ordeals and pain' over accusations made against him by his spurned lover Valérie Trierweiler in a book

When asked about the book, The Telegraph reports that Mr Hollande said: 'I have already expressed myself on this
 subject and I have already said what I felt about my ordeals and pain. I
 will give you no further response.'

The book's accusations, hugely damaging to a socialist, came as Mr Hollande's approval ratings sat at a record low 13 per cent and as employment rates continue to rise, and the economy remained stagnant.

While vowing to see out his term in office which ends in 2017, Mr Hollande acknowledged France was 'asking questions about its future in a climate of deep distrust'.

He said voters should reserve their judgement about his performance until the end of his term, saying, although his policies hadn't prompted a quick recovery, 'today we have all the conditions to succeed'.

He said his government could rise to the challenge of improving France's economy, slashing debts and reducing unemployment.

While dismissing further questions about Ms Trierweiler's book, Mr Hollande spoke widely about a wide range of issues including Iraq, the Ebola crisis, Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

Mr Hollande dismissed rumours of a rivalry with pro-business prime minister, Manuel Valls, who he appointed saying: 'I am not a candidate, I am president. I will be president right to the end.'
