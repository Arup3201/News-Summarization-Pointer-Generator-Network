Just one in four students leave university with the highest levels of reading and writing, according to a new international study. 

While increasing numbers of people are going on to higher education, the majority do not  reach the highest standards in literacy, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s, annual education report.

Andreas Schleicher, the organisation’s director for education and skills, said the findings show that while more people in the UK are gaining qualifications, this is not being matched by improved skills in reading and writing. He suggested this was similar with numeracy.

The latest Education At A Glance study reveals that a student in the UK is now more likely to go to university than they are to finish their education on leaving school.

In 2012, around two in five 25 to 64-year-olds (41per cent) held a degree or equivalent qualification, while 37per cent stopped studying after gaining their GCSEs or A-levels.

It also shows that in 2012, the last year for which data is available, 48per cent of UK young people aged 25 to 34 had been to university or college, compared to 33per cent of 55 to 64-year-olds.

But while more people are continuing their education, the report suggests that this is not reflected in better basic skills.

The data, which draws on international tests conducted by the OECD, shows that just 25per cent of graduates in England and Northern Ireland have the highest levels of ability in literacy.

Study:  Literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school, before they go on to higher education, and universities may assume that students already have these abilities

In many high-performing countries, including Australia, Finland, Japan, the Netherlands and Sweden, more than a third of graduates are performing at this level.

'On the one hand in the UK you can say qualification levels have risen enormously, lots more people are getting tertiary qualifications, university degrees, but actually not all of that is visible in better skills,' Mr Schleicher said.

'In the UK, it’s at best a middle position,' he suggested. 'I think that’s something, quality and degrees do not always align.'

He added: 'There’s also a big distribution in outcomes. What’s interesting is when you look at people with tertiary qualifications, there’s a lot of variability in the skills those people have attained.

'Not all further education qualifications really deserve that name because often those individuals are not actually better skilled than people who have just come out of school.'

The figures cover not just university degrees, but any type of higher level, or 'tertiary' qualification.

Mr Schleicher said that he would have expected the UK to perform better at the highest levels of literacy.

'UK universities have a very strong reputation - you would have expected this stronger prevalence among the most highly skilled people.'

In general, literacy and numeracy skills can reflect what a student has learnt at school, before they go on to higher education, Mr Schleicher said, adding that universities may assume that students already have these abilities, when they could be improved.

The latest report shows that around a third of 25 to 34-year-olds in England and Northern Ireland have achieved a higher level of education than their mothers and fathers, but adds that parents’ level of education still has a strong influence on a child’s educational achievement.

An individual in England and Northern Ireland whose parents hold a degree is more than six times more likely to go into higher education than someone whose parents did not gain their GCSEs.

It adds that greater access to higher education does not necessarily lead to better social mobility - essentially more poorer students going on to study for a degree. Social background is still a key factor in going into higher education, it is suggested.

The OECD also found that the UK is one of very few countries to have worked out a sustainable approach to funding higher education, through fees and loans. However, this is based on the old system, before fees were tripled to a maximum of £9,000 per year.

Education and childcare minister Sam Gyimah said: 'We are committed to providing flexible, affordable and good quality childcare, giving parents more of a choice about where they send their children, so that they can get the best start in life.

'As a result of our plan for education more families than ever before are now eligible for free childcare, including 15 free hours a week for all three and four-year-olds and, from next year, tax free childcare of up to £2,000 per child.

'The benefits of good quality childcare can last a child a lifetime and are especially crucial for children who are from more disadvantaged backgrounds to stop them falling behind their peers.

'This is why we’ve also extended free childcare to the 40% most disadvantaged children and introduced the Early Years Pupil Premium.'

Big classes 'mean better teachers': Bigger UK class sizes mean teachers are better paid 

Class sizes in the UK are bigger than many other countries, but this may be because there is more focus on the quality of teachers.

There are around 21 pupils per teacher in UK primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development’s annual education report.

This is higher than the OECD averages of 15 children per teacher in primary education and 13 students for every teacher in secondary education.

Numbers: There are around 21 pupils per teacher in UK primary schools and 16 students for each teacher in secondaries, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development

It means that the UK effectively has larger class sizes than many other countries including Australia, France, Germany and the United States.

But Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, said that nations may have to make a 'trade-off' between smaller classes and paying teachers more, and many high-performing countries choose the latter.

'You can spend your money only once, so if you have a fixed amount of money that’s the kind of trade-off you have to make,' he said.

He added: 'Basically smaller classes limit your capacity to pay teachers better, and that’s the trade-off you can see in the data.'

Mr Schleicher said that as far as the UK was concerned, in upper secondary education, decisions over class sizes and teachers are consistent with what is seen in many high-performing countries.

'Finland will be doing the same, Japan will be doing the same, Singapore, Korea. All those countries prioritise teaching and teachers over infrastructure and class size.'

The report also shows that in the early years, or nursery education, there are around 19 children per teacher, higher than the OECD average of 14 pupils per teacher.

The figures cover teachers only, and do not include teaching assistants or other school and nursery staff.

Mr Schleicher said that the UK uses a lot of non-teaching staff in nursery schools, adding that in many other countries there are more teachers in early years education.
