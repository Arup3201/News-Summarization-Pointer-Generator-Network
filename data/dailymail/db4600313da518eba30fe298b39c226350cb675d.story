New Hampshire police have released a sketch of a man they believe may be connected to the disappearance of a 15-year-old, who went missing for nine months.

Abigail Hernandez went missing on October 9 last year as she walked home from school just days before her 15th birthday.

Police believe the man in the sketch may have driven the schoolgirl away in a blue pick up truck. She was safely reunited with her family Sunday.

Safe: Abigail Hernandez has been reunited with her family nine months after she disappeared on her way home from school

Wanted: Police have released a sketch of a man suspected of driving away with the then 14-year-old Abigail

Based on information provided by Abigail, police say they are looking for a slightly overweight man with darkish skin, brown eyes, and stubble. He was described as being slightly taller than the 5ft 4in teenager.

Few details have been released about Abigail's disappearance and where she has been for the past nine months.

The only contact she had with her family was a letter believed to have been sent by the schoolgirl to her parents in the weeks after her disappearance.

Although it didn't provide details on what had happened to her, the letter gave parents Zenya and Ruben Hernandez some hope that Abigail was at least still alive.

Police are investigating whether the man in the sketch, or anyone else, was involved in the disappearance, and whether Abigail was taken against her will, or enticed away, and where she was kept for the past nine months.

The bright schoolgirl was just 14 when she went missing, and had no means to provide food, shelter or other necessities.

Hope: Abigail's frantic family received a letter from the teenager after she went missing, giving them faith that she was still alive

Missed: Abigail's family and New Hampshire community had been searching for the schoolgirl for months

Contact: Abigail Hernandez's mother Zenya, pictured left with the teenager's sister Sarah, wrote a Christmas letter to her daughter begging her to come home in December. She has now safely returned

New Hampshire police said it was a felony for any person to remove, detain or conceal a child under the age of 18, who is not a relative.

If it is found that Abigail was removed against her will, or under the circumstances described by police, then appropriate charges will be brought.

Attorney 
General Foster said: 'We are all pleased Abigail was returned safely to 
her family. Law enforcement officers must now obtain satisfactory 
answers to the questions surrounding the facts and circumstances of 
Abigail’s disappearance and nine-month absence.'

He added: 'The
 individual or individuals who were involved with her disappearance and 
absence will now have to face the consequences of any unlawful actions.'

On a Facebook page that was set up to try to help find Abigail, a statement was released asking supporters for their patience while the investigation continued.

Returned: Abigail Hernandez, pictured in security footage on the day she disappeared, returned home Sunday

'Many people have been requesting specific answers and details as to exactly what happened to Abby. While we appreciate the desire for answers, this is still very much an ongoing law enforcement investigation and no details can be released that could jeopardize the integrity of their work,' the post said.

Previous details about the case, including details of the letter the Hernandez family had received, were also delayed to protect the investigation.

Officials delayed information about the letter so it could be thoroughly analyzed in order to be certain that it was actually written by the teenager.

Law enforcement officials said at the time that although the letter had given them hope, they feared deeply for Miss Hernandez's safety.

One FBI investigator had even suggested that Abigail could face a similar danger to the young women in Cleveland, Ohio, who escaped after being held for ten years by Ariel Castro.

When Abigail unexpectedly returned Sunday, her parents were overjoyed, with Mrs Hernandez saying they were 'the happiest people on earth'.

Anyone who recognizes the man depicted in the sketch is asked to contact New Hampshire police at (603) 271-3636 or the Conway Police Department at (603) 356-5715.
