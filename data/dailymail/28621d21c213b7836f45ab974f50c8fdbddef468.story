Every government contract with the two security firms accused of overcharging for tagging criminals is being reviewed to see if the taxpayer has been ripped off across Whitehall.

Ministers ordered wholesale checks to be carried out after it emerged taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country.

G4S received £1billion in revenue from UK Government contracts last year, while Serco made £2billion.

Taxpayers could have overpaid two private companies for their work tagging criminals

The Serious Fraud Office has been asked to examine charges made by security giant G4S, which together with rival company Serco is accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which did not exist.

Business Secretary Vince Cable today said ‘something bad’ had happened after it emerged up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the government was billed for every day were not real.

Multi-million pound contracts across Whitehall are now being scrutinised to see if the problem is more widespread, including in the Business department.

Mr Cable said: ‘We are reviewing them. We haven't yet identified any contracts that are a problem, but certainly we are going through this very carefully now.

‘The Government has been looking very carefully at how it gets value for money and has judged that there is some overcharging taking place and we are trying to get down to competitive costs.

‘So there is now very tough auditing of funding and these companies [Serco and G4S] have been found to be overcharging and we are doing something about it.’

The tagging revelations have raised fresh doubts about government plans to outsource more state work to private firms.

But Mr Cable insisted: ‘There are lots of success stories that you don't hear about, but where there is bad practice and lack of care then obviously we've got to tighten up.

‘I think one of the good side-effects of the financial crisis is that the Government has been forced to look much more carefully at public spending across the board and squeeze out value for money in every corner.

‘That's what we are now doing and we've identified these areas where there were bad contractual arrangements and they are being toughened up.’

However, there are growing questions about the role of senior civil servants for failing to spot the problem with the tagging contracts sooner.

The Government spent more than £394 million on contracts with security giant G4S last year.

The
figure soared by more than £65 million in a year, leading Labour MP 
Barry Sheerman (Huddersfield) to brand G4S the 'private army' of the 
state.

Most of the increase
was down to a £51 million hike in spending by the Ministry of Justice, 
the department now facing questions over its contracts for electronic 
tagging.

Mr
Sheerman uncovered the figures in a series of parliamentary questions 
and received answers from all departments apart from the Department for 
Communities and Local Government.

Here
is a summary of Government department spending on G4S contracts in 
2012/13 (excluding the Department for Communities and Local Government 
and departments who did not spend any money on G4S contracts):

A disciplinary investigation has been 
launched into former officials in the Ministry of Justice  after 
discovering contract managers were aware of billing issues in 2008, but 
‘nothing substantive was done’.

The scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales.

Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005.

In
some cases private contractors charged the Government for years after 
tagging had stopped and cases included being charged for tags for dead 
people.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling yesterday condemned the 'wholly indefensible and unacceptable state of affairs'.

In May it emerged auditors had been 
called in to examine payments to Serco and G4S, which monitor around 
20,000 criminals at any one time.

But Mr Grayling told the House of 
Commons that G4S has refused to take part in an additional audit so the 
Government can rule out the possibility that that dishonesty was 
involved in any of the contracts, while Serco has agreed to this demand.

He added: ‘It included charges for people who were back in prison and had had their tags removed, for people who had left the country and those who had never been tagged in the first place but who had instead been returned to court.

'There are a small number of cases where charging was known to have continued for a period where the subject was known to have died.

'In some instances charging continued for a period many months and indeed years after active monitoring had ceased.’

The use of firms like G4S have been thrown into the spotlight after it failed to provide thousands of guards to provide security for the London Olympics, leading to the arm to be called in.

A Downing Street spokesman said the row would not lead the Government to give up the practice of outsourcing public service activities to the private sector.

'This hasn't changed the overarching view that when it comes to reforming public services, it is important to look at the best way to deliver public services, whether by the state, private sector organisations or voluntary sector organisations,' he said.

The revelation is potentially embarrassing for Mr Grayling as he prepares to roll plans to hand out up to 70 per cent of probation services over to the private sector or charities.

An urgent review of contract management across the Ministry of Justice's major contracts has also been launched and will report by autumn.

Ian Lawrence, general secretary of the National Association of Probation Officers (Napo) trade union, said: 'We've long maintained that these companies are unfit for purpose when it comes to holding important public contracts.

'The outcome of the initial investigation into G4S and Serco suggests a good deal of malpractice has been discovered.'

Labour's shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan said the ‘revelations are truly shocking’.

‘Given the scale of the allegations, the Government must immediately call in the police and the Serious Fraud Office to investigate both companies as fraud has potentially taken place.

'There can be no cosy relationships with either company if we are to truly get to the bottom of these very serious allegations. If it was anyone else the police would be asked to investigate potential criminality. Why isn't this happening now?'

G4S, which saw its shares fall nearly 4 per cent after the announcement, is no stranger to controversy after its London 2012 Olympics contract fiasco.

It was left nursing losses of £88 million after it failed to provide all of its 10,400 contracted employees last year, prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap.

G4S group chief executive Ashley Almanza said: ‘We place the highest premium on customer service and integrity and therefore take very seriously the concerns expressed by the Ministry of Justice.’

Serco group chief executive Christopher Hyman said: ‘Serco is a business led by our values and built on the strength of our reputation for integrity. We are deeply concerned if we fall short of the standards expected.’
