Speaking out: Soldier Andy Julien, pictured, survived a friendly-fire attack and has accused Ministers of covering up the Army's failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues

A soldier who survived a friendly-fire attack has accused Ministers of covering up the Army’s failure to issue equipment that could have saved the lives of his colleagues.

Andy Julien has made his claims ahead of a landmark court ruling that could pave the way for wounded servicemen or grieving families to sue the military over ‘avoidable’ deaths or injuries.

The former trooper was in a Challenger II tank when it came under fire from another British Challenger II on the fourth day of the 2003 Iraq War.

Corporal Stephen Allbutt and Trooper David Clarke died in the attack, while Trooper Julien and Lance Corporal Dan Twiddy suffered severe injuries. All four were serving with the Queen’s Royal Lancers attached to 1st Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers.

Court papers seen by The Mail on Sunday show that the Ministry of Defence had leased 47 state-of-the-art satellite recognition sets from the US which were capable of tracking friendly tank movements, but it failed to deploy them in the conflict.

The surviving servicemen and Cpl Allbutt’s widow Debbi claim the Government tried to cover up this failure by denying them information.

They allege they were obstructed from seeing witness statements by other tank crews that revealed breakdowns in communication.

Later this month the Court of Appeal will rule on whether 27-year-old Mr Julien – who was medically discharged from the Army in 2004 – L/Cpl Twiddy and Mrs Allbutt have the right to sue the MoD for negligence. 

Mr Julien, from Manchester, who is now an accounts manager and is speaking for the first time about the friendly fire incident, says there was a lack of equipment, ranging from the high-tech tank-identification units to simple desert combat uniform.

He remembers how, after he was injured, a corporal delivered a brutal assessment of his condition: ‘The good news is you are still alive but the bad news is that I can see your bones protruding through both your legs.’ And he can recall in vivid detail the horror and confusion as the first round struck his tank while he and  L/Cpl Twiddy were resting on top of the vehicle because of the heat.

‘People were shouting, “Get in the tank,” ’ he said. ‘Someone was saying, “Come on, quick get in the tank, he’s dead, he’s dead.” I suspect they were making reference to me because I couldn’t move and I couldn’t talk.

‘I just remember a buzzing noise in my ears and loads of screaming and shouting around the tank. I couldn’t hear Stephen [Allbutt, who had been inside the tank with Trooper Clarke] any more. I was just hearing Daniel [Twiddy] shouting and screaming.

‘I was on the back deck of the tank at that point. I wasn’t in any pain but I knew there was something up with my legs because there was like a warm sensation. Daniel shouted at me and called my name.’

Then he remembers his attention turning to the tank, where the turret was engulfed in flames. ‘I was focused on Trooper Clarke and Stephen [Allbutt]. I started calling their names but there was no response. While I was trying to crawl off the tank I remember hearing an explosion, like a second round, which blew me off the tank and caused me an injury to my head.’

As he lay on the ground he could see another tank coming towards him. ‘If I had remained there the likelihood is it would have run over me. I just had to crawl out of the way of the tank. There was a third round, which hit our tank.

‘This one exploded right near the hull, near the hatch, which then caused all the ammunition in the tank to go up. At first I thought we were under enemy attack but then a sergeant said, “It’s friendly fire, it’s friendly fire.”

‘I thought it was the Americans. When I heard it was another British tank I was really angry, because all this training that they said they were supposed to provide, plus the kind of tank we were in, someone should know how to spot one of those tanks at night-time.

‘There was a lack of equipment, even standard gear like desert combats. We were going out in green combat gear. Friendly identification tracking equipment was not in place although it was available.’

The American army was actually using it. There was other equipment that was readily available, which came to light after further investigations by his solicitors that could have been provided – identification and orientation equipment.

‘It has always been a struggle to get information and documents from the MoD. While I was in the forces it was, “Anything that happens in the Army stays in the Army.” Everything has taken place behind closed doors.

'When I was trying to get information on the equipment, there were people who had expertise in that field who could provide that information but weren’t able to do so because they had contracts with the MoD.’

Mr Julien’s allegations were echoed at Stephen Allbutt’s inquest in 2007, in which coroner Andrew Walker concluded the deaths and injuries were ‘completely avoidable’ and blamed the Army for poor communication.

The injured soldiers and Mrs Allbutt were given permission by a High Court judge to bring a claim of negligence against the MoD.

But the Government has instructed top barristers, at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds, to block this in the Court of Appeal.

The claimants also now fear that controversial plans to bring in ‘secret courts’ to hear cases involving sensitive material will serve only to further obstruct their fight for justice.

Shubhaa Srinivasan, of Mr Julien’s solicitors Leigh Day & Co, said: ‘Families of soldiers are frustrated in their attempts to seek truth and justice at the very outset under the Army’s Board of Inquiry rules, which preclude victims and their families from participating.

‘In the Allbutt inquest the soldier’s family and the two injured soldiers were not provided with a full unredacted copy of the Board’s findings and an accompanying explanation. This is fairly common.’

She said that at the inquest the MoD had taken an obstructive approach by censoring nearly all of the Board of Inquiry material and other relevant investigations. Accusing the MoD of ‘a lack of openness and transparency’, she said: ‘We had to fight hard to get crucial material unredacted and it was only done after the coroner also insisted.

‘For example, the Royal Military Police had interviewed several soldiers [who were the crew in the firing tank] as they had been investigated for gross negligence.

‘The interview transcripts were withheld under the pretext the MoD needed to get permission from the soldiers before providing them.  

‘Although such documents were ultimately provided, this was very late in the day. The victims are left with a feeling that they need to fight for every bit of information.’

The MoD, which declined to comment on the case, argues that the questions surrounding military equipment and operational deployment are matters for Parliament rather than the courts.

It also says that if the court finds in favour of Mr Julien and the others, it will have a damaging effect on morale.
