These pictures of a surfboard with a large chunk missing are testament to a terrifying shark attack that left a 25-year-old man with wounds up and down his torso.

The unidentified man was attacked off the coast of North Jetty in South Bay, California, and rushed to hospital for surgery.

His board shows how lucky he was in the shark attack with a large bite mark taken out of the center of the board.

Fortunately for the victim there was an off-duty EMT nearby and he jumped into action, using his body to compress the wound until the ambulance could take him away.

He told NBC Bay Area: ‘He was really gashed up and he had four or five serious gashes from his nipple down to his hip, and was bleeding out pretty good.'

The surfer was rushed to St John’s Hospital where he underwent surgery on Tuesday. He remains in fair condition today.

Witnesses told the Eureka Times-Standard that the attack occurred around noon on Tuesday at Samoa Beach, near Eureaka.

One witness, Jason Gabriel, saw the surfer coming out of the water, with 12-inch gashes along his ribs.

‘He was going, “Oh my God, oh my God”,’ Mr Gabriel said.

Only last week, 39-year-old surfer Francisco Javier Solorio Jr. was attacked by a Great White shark in front of his friend in Santa Barbara.

An expert has determined that Mr Solorio was killed by a 15- to 16-foot Great White shark which bit in to his upper torso in the waters off Surf Beach on Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Mr Solorio died at the scene despite his friend's desperate efforts to save him.

Solorio's friend who was surfing with him witnessed the shark bite or hit the man, said sheriff's Sgt. Mark A. Williams.

The friend ended up swimming over and pulling him from the water onto the beach, where he received first aid. The friend started first aid while another surfer called for help.

Paramedics who arrived on the beach took over the CPR, but the 39-year-old man was pronounced dead at the scene.

Officials said a shark bit Solorio in his upper torso.
