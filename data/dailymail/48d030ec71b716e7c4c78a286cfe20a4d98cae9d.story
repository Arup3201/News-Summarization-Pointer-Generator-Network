A homophobic family in New Jersey has refused to tip a gay marine-turned-waitress, scrawling on the check that they 'do not agree with her lifestyle.'

Dayna Morales said she was offended and hurt by how the couple, with two small children, treated her while she served them at Gallop Asian Bistro in Bridgewater Wednesday.

She sent the receipt to Have A Gay Day and the LGBT Facebook Group posted it online, where it has since garnered hundreds of supportive comments.

Morales said the judgement began as soon as she introduced herself to the family.

The mother, shocked by her short hair, allegedly exclaimed, 'Oh, I thought you were gonna say your name is Dan! You sure surprised us!'

But it got worse when, after the family had paid the $93.55 check, she discovered they had left a note on the receipt.

'Sorry, I cannot tip because I do not agree with your lifestyle and the way you live your life,' the comment read.

In an email, Morales said she was upset she'd served in the marines to protect such ignorant Americans and was concerned about the example the couple were setting for their children.

'Never in a million years did I think this would happen,' she told Have A Gay Day.

'I am THOROUGHLY offended, mad, p***ed off and hurt that THIS is what her kids will grow up learning and that I served in the Marines to keep ignorant people like them free.

'Sorry lady but I don't agree with YOUR lifestyle and the way you're raising your kids but you didn't see me throwing that in your face and giving you shitty service.'

Morales' story was met with an outpouring of support online, with a heterosexual Facebook user commenting, 'as a member of the heterosexual community, I beg your forgiveness for these ignorant people' and another wrote 'I hope those parents get publicly humiliated enough to never leave their house again! I feel sorry for their kids.'

Morales later responded that it took every fiber of her being not to spit in the couple's food, but her faith in humanity was now restored.

'You all have put the BIGGEST smile on my face tonight and made me realize that there are more good people in the world than bad,' she wrote.
