Boris Johnson has dropped in on Washington's Smithsonian Air institute during his six-day jaunt to the U.S., but not before taking a swipe at George Osborne and suggesting Americans still wish they were ruled by the Queen.

The London mayor yesterday called on the Chancellor to hand massive financial powers to cities to help 'detoxify' British politics.

He further claimed that Westminster was going through a 'very rocky period' and devolution would help to 'electrify' the political scene.

Later that day, after catching a train from New York to Washington, he visited the Smithsonian Air institute where he was pictured gazing at exhibits ranging from early Boeing models to the Apollo  space missions.

The Boeing Milestones of Flight Hall also captivated the mayor during his six-day jaunt to the U.S.

Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington DC, Mr Johnson insisted the Treasury had 'nothing to fear' from reforms - and insisted such a move would have had the support of Winston Churchill. 

Mr Johnson said: 'To get it done you simply have to get the Treasury to understand that they make more money out of this.

'They have nothing to fear. Even a Labour mayor couldn't possibly make a hash of this. Winston Churchill would have got it done.'

Mr Johnson said devolving fiscal powers would give cities a mandate to push growth policies instead of having to go 'begging for penny packets of funding'.

The move would be fiscally neutral so would be a 'no lose' move for the Treasury, the mayor insisted.

He added: 'When you look at the state of politics in Britain there is no question that it is going through a very rocky period. Politicians are not thought generally to be in touch with people, there's a lack of communication, people don't feel the politicians are answering their needs. Devolution is obviously the way forward.'

He will today return to New York for talks with his counterpart in the city as he completes his U.S. trade mission.

Bill de Blasio pulled out of a meeting with the London mayor earlier this week citing ill health, despite attending an event at New York University the same evening.

The left-wing New York mayor is expected to be well enough after recovering from a cold to discuss ways of boosting links between the two cities at the rescheduled talks this evening.

After arriving back in city, Mr Johnson will head straight to the 9/11 memorial then tour the New York Fire Department. 

Meanwhile Mr Johnson has used his six-day, £25,000 jaunt to the US to present himself as an international statesman.

But he has got some way to go to raise his profile stateside, after revealing he was stopped in the street by a New Yorker who thought he was another tousled- haired blond: American tycoon Donald Trump.

The London Mayor is trying to woo investors to the UK capital, but risked raising hackles with a claim that Americans secretly wish they were still ruled by the Queen of England.

Mr Johnson has defended his globetrotting against claims he is a 'part-time mayor', arguing he is boosting business back home in London.

He started in Boston at the beginning of the week and has been in New York meeting fashionistas including Alexa Chung.

Appearing on LBC radio from the Big Apple, he was questioned by a New Yorker about his infamous mop of unruly blond hair.

He insisted he has it styled that way, before revealing how it meant it was mistaken for Mr Trump during his visit.

'It's better than the other question I was asked by… I was walking down the street and then somebody was taking my photograph and a young woman stopped and she said, 'Is that Trump?' So! I think she meant, 'Is that Donald Trump?'

At 68, Mr Trump is almost two decades older than the 50-year-old London Mayor, who joked he was more famous and wealthier than the businessman, thought to be worth $4billion.

There was a sense that Americans are not taking Mr Johnson entirely seriously yesterday when his political ambitions were mocked by U.S. presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton today.

Mrs Clinton, the former Secretary of State who is expected to be the Democratic nomination for president in 2018, asked whether U.S.-born Mr Johnson had turned his sights to the White House.

She said: 'Is he announcing for president? Which one do you think he'll be, Democrat or Republican?'

The jibe comes followed criticism of Mr Johnson's 'promotional tour' of the United States, amid claims he is using it to boost his chances of being the next Conservative leader.

The U.S. jaunt is his third long-haul mission in the last three months, having already visited Iraq and Far East.

Taking questions from Americans on the radio, Mr Johnson was repeatedly asked about his dealings with the Queen, from the names of her Corgis to what they chat about. 

He joked that America's fascination with the Queen is a mark of a secret desire to be reunited with Britain in a 'commonwealth of English-speaking peoples', reversing the declaration of independence from the British empire made in 1776.

Three out of four questions to the mayor from Americans on his LBC radio phone-in related to the Royal Family, with Mr Johnson asked when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called.

Mr Johnson said: 'What does this show you? That deep down, in a primal way, they regret the fundamental schism of 1776 and they wish that we were in a single commonwealth of English-speaking peoples again united under Her Majesty. That's what they secretly want.'

He added: 'What do they want? Royalty. They have been deprived of it too long, that blissful pride that goes with a hereditary monarchy.'

He was grilled about his dealings with the Queen, but was unable to say when he last spoke to the Queen, what kind of sandwiches were eaten at Buckingham Palace, and what Her Majesty's pet corgis were called

However, Mr Johnson proved incapable of answering any of the requests for information about the royals.

On the sandwiches served in the Palace, he joked: 'I don't know. Ham from Bucking?'

And on the corgis' names, he said: 'I haven't got the faintest idea what they are called. Basil? Eric?'

Mr Johnson revealed that he had not spoken to the Queen since shortly after the 2012 Olympics, when she asked about her cameo appearance alongside James Bond actor Daniel Craig, which ended with a lookalike parachuting into the stadium.

'She very innocently wanted to know whether people thought it was funny and I said it was brilliant,' said Mr Johnson.

Asked whether he had really not spoken to the Queen since then, he replied: 'I don't get to see the Queen that often. What do you think I do? Spend my whole time round Buckingham Palace sucking up to the monarchy?'
