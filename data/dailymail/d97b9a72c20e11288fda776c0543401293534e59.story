An animal lover has served up a Christmas turkey feast for forty dogs with all the trimmings including sprouts, roast potatoes and even pigs in blankets.

Claire Nash spent hours making the dinner and dishing it up to the animals at the Cardiff Dogs Home.

The mother-of-four then watched in delight as the abandoned dogs wolfed down and enjoyed their Christmas treat.

Mrs Nash, 44, made the animals a turkey dinner with all the trimmings including sprouts, roast potatoes and even pigs in blankets 

The mother-of-four is a volunteer at the kennels and spent £70 on food for the dogs before cooking it and serving it up for them in their bowls 

Mrs Nash said: 'Everyone deserves to be spoilt at Christmas and I'm happy to share a bit of festive spirit with all the dogs who don't have an owner to treat them this Christmas.

'It just makes me so sad knowing these dogs won't be curled up in front of a roaring fire being cuddled and petted, so I decided to make Christmas special for them.

'Some people think I'm barmy feeding dogs all this sumptuous food instead of humans but I like caring for the dogs who have no one else.'

For the dogs, Mrs Nash prepared stuffing, Yorkshire puddings, six different types of vegetables and home made gravy made with pork dripping 

Mrs Nash is a regular volunteer at the dogs' home where she can often being found walking the abandoned pets or cleaning out the kennels.

She decided the homeless dogs and abandoned strays deserved a Christmas dinner and spent £70 buying food for them.

The 40 Christmas dinners Mrs Nash served up for the dogs. She even defrosted the turkey two days before cooking it to make sure the dogs didn't end up feeling unwell

She even made sure to defrost the turkey two days before cooking it to make sure the dogs didn't end up feeling unwell.

Mrs Nash added: 'It is costing me some money but I really don't mind. I am a dog lover and volunteering is a real passion of mine.

'They deserve a proper Christmas feast to enjoy.

'It is so satisfying to see them have a big stretch after their meal and fall into a restful sleep.'

Mrs Nash made the Christmas dinner for the dogs a couple of days early so she can concentrate on her own family festive meal.

But after cooking for her husband and children on Christmas Day, she plans to go and visit the dogs at the pound.
