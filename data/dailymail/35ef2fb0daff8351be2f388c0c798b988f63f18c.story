A couple of newlyweds who sued Carnival Cruises following the ill-fated Triumph voyage earlier this year were not actually on board at the time, it was revealed.

Luke Cash and Ami 'Summer' Gallagher's attorney filed a lawsuit last week after the couple allegedly suffered 'deplorable, unsafe and unsanitary conditions' on the February cruise.

However they were most definitely on dry land at the time in Kemah, Texas where they told a reporter for the Houston Chronicle that their upcoming wedding plans had been ruined by the ill-fated trip.

Luke Cash and Ami 'Summer' Gallagher were not on the stranded Carnival cruise ship in February but have still filed a lawsuit to claim damages after their wedding plans had to be changed

Carnival also confirmed on Tuesday that the couple, from Houston, were not on board the February 9 cruise.

More than 3,000 passengers spent five days stranded in the Gulf of Mexico following an engine room fire on the ship.

There were limited toilets, no air conditioning and lack of food, with the incident quickly becoming a PR disaster for Carnival.Â 

The couple's lawyer John Bruster Loyd admitted that the couple had not actually been on board the crippled cruise ship. He told chron.com: 'I screwed up.'

He said that he last spoke to his clients around six or seven months ago and had forgotten a significant point. He emphasized that his clients had not misled anyone.

Mr Loyd added: 'They
told me the correct thing but so much time had passed since we last 
spoke about the case I forgot the biggest detail, that they hadn't been 
on the boat.'

The attorney has since amended the lawsuit. The couple are still suing Carnival for 'breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and fraud'.

The Cashes released a statement today where they said that they were suing Carnival as they had not made good on their promise of reimbursement and they were thousands of dollars out of pocket for their rescheduled wedding.
