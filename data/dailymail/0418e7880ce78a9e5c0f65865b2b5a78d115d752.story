Sergio Aguero was a goal away from joining the elitist of Premier League clubs on Saturday - but did become Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. 

The striker scored all four goals in  City's thumping 4-1 victory over Tottenham at the Etihad, but also missed a penalty. He has now scored 61 Premier League goals - moving ahead of Carlos Tevez's in City's all-time list.

Had the 26-year-old scored his second spot kick – he took three during the match, scoring two – he would have become only the fifth player to score five goals in a Premier League match.

Nonetheless, Aguero did add his name to the list of players to score four goals in a game in what proved a memorable performance.

Aguero opened the scoring after 13 minutes for the hosts, before Christian Eriksen replied almost instantly for Spurs after a slip from Fernando let the visitors in.

The Argentine then went on to restore City's lead as he slotted home from the spot, before missing another penalty before the break.

Aguero then netted another penalty and scored another impressive strike after the interval as City ran out convincing winners.

Last season Manuel Pellegrini suggested Aguero was behind only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo among the world's best players and, now he has apparently overcome the numerous injuries that have plagued him ever since, the City boss is again of similar opinion.

Pellegrini said: 'It was not easy for Kun last year when he had too many injuries. You can't put in performances like he did today when you're not 100 per cent fit.

Sergio Aguero's four-goal haul against Tottenham makes him Manchester City's all-time top Premier League scorer. 

Sergio Aguero - 61 goals (95 games)

Carlos Tevez - 58 goals (113 games)

Edin Dzeko - 48 goals (115 games)

Yaya Toure - 42 goals (141 games)

Nicolas Anelka - 37 goals (89 games) 

'But now he's working very well. Maybe he will not score four goals in a game again but he will demonstrate why everyone says he's one of the best players in the world.

'I have said before he could be a Ballon d'Or player.

'I have known him a lot of years. I saw his career in Argentina and Spain before he came to England and that's why I say he'd one of the three or four most important strikers in the world - not (just) because he scored four goals.'
