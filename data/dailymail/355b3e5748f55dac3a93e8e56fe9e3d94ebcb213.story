For anyone who can claim to have scaled America's tallest mountain this news may come as a bit of a disappointment.

According to a new map published by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Mount McKinley is not as tall as previously thought.

New technology used by USGS has revealed the Alaskan mountain, also known as Denali, tops out at 20,237 feet, 83 feet short of the 20,320 feet usually given.

Mount McKinley is still the highest peak in Northern America despite a survey revealing it is 83 feet lower than previously thought

The new data comes from a 2012 survey done using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, a technology designed to track very small geographic changes. The last published measurement was taken in 1952.

In a statement on its website, USGS said that the change could be down to more precise technology, different methods of compilation, or climate.

Climbers need not worry about their 
bragging rights, however, as the peak is still far taller than Mount 
Saint Elias, America's second tallest, which tops out at 18,009 feet.

Mount McKinley, whose Alaskan name is Denali, was named as a patriotic gesture for the then Presidential candidate William McKinley

The first men to successfully climb Mount McKinley were four amateurs in 1910 lead by Peter Anderson and Billy Taylor who made it to the lower North summit using homemade equipment and carrying donuts and hot chocolate.

The so-called Sourdough Expedition completed the climb as a bet rumored to have been made with a local bar owner who said it would never be climbed.

After three months on the mountain the team planted a 14 foot spruce pole topped with an American flag to mark their success in the hope it could be seen with a telescope, but their story was widely doubted.

The first man to set foot on the summit was Walter Harper in 1913, an Alaskan native, who reached it along with Robert Tantum in a team lead by Harry Karstens and Hudson Stuck. Along the way they spotted the spruce pole, verifying the earlier attempt.

The mountain was named McKinley after the then Presidential candidate William McKinley who became the 25th US President, though it is also referred to as Denali which is its traditional Alaskan name.
