Bayern Munich star Arjen Robben has backed his former manager Louis van Gaal to turn Manchester United into a European force.

Robben, who was on Van Gaal’s list of summer transfer targets, has no doubt his Bayern and Holland boss will do the restructuring job that is required at United. 

‘I was very happy for him that he won the game against QPR last weekend,’ said Robben.

‘If you are not winning, you get the pressure but the management at United know what sort of coach they have got and I am very confident he will be successful there.

‘I have worked with Van Gaal at Bayern as well as with Holland, so I have known him for a very long time. He is one of the few coaches who can make teams play better. He makes players better.

‘He will get United back into the Champions League next season, where they belong.’

Robben, who returned from injury to play in Bayern’s 1-0 Champions League win over Manchester City on Wednesday night, says City face a fight to qualify for the next phase after Roma beat CSKA Moscow 5-1.

‘Roma had a big win and it was a surprise. I looked up at the scoreboard after 20 minutes and saw it was already 3-0, so they are flying,' he says.

‘It’s hard to say (if City will go through). We are only thinking about ourselves and we want to go through, we want to win our games and be top of the group. We will give everything to do that.’
