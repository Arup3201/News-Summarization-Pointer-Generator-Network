The country’s biggest energy firm will today hit millions with an inflation-busting hike in prices.

Nearly 8million British Gas customers face a 10.4 per cent rise in electricity prices and an 8.4 per cent increase in gas rates.

The increase, which comes as temperatures across the UK are set to drop to almost zero, will add £131 to the average family’s fuel bill, pushing it to an eye-watering £1,444 a year.

A week ago, another of Britain’s Big Six suppliers, SSE, raised prices by 8.2 per cent  on average, affecting around 7.3million customers.

Five of the major providers have so far announced higher than inflation price rises, which will have an impact on almost every household in Britain.

The remaining increases will take effect in December and January, the coldest months of the year. Only German-owned E.ON has yet to announce a rise – but it has warned tariff hikes are ‘increasingly likely’.

An estimated 24,000 people die every winter from the cold, with the elderly particularly at risk. More than 6million fear they will not be able to heat their homes, according to data from charity Age UK.

Adam Scorer, of consumer watchdog Consumer Futures, said: ‘Millions of households will go into winter genuinely afraid of the costs of keeping warm. Fuel poverty is already close to epidemic proportions and it is set to become even more commonplace.’

Clare Welton, of campaign group Fuel Poverty Action, said: ‘British Gas’s steep price rises are sure to send a shiver down the spine of millions of their hard-up customers, particularly in the knowledge that Centrica, their parent company, reported £1.58billion operating profits in the six months to June this year.

‘High bills and price rises will force millions of households to choose between heating and eating this winter.’

Tom Lyon, of comparison site uSwitch, said: ‘British Gas  customers have had the rug pulled from under their feet and I suspect that many will be feeling let down and betrayed. Adding a further £131 to an already sky-high energy bill will leave many buckling, but the real damage will be to trust.’

EDF gave the lowest increase of 3.9 per cent, still significantly higher than inflation, after pledging not to pass on soaring green levies to customers.

British Gas, SSE and npower have all vowed to reduce price hikes if the Government moves the burden of green costs from energy to general taxation. Energy bills, which have consistently risen faster than wages, have climbed the political agenda as more and more families struggle with the cost.

Ed Miliband has pledged to freeze bills after the next election if Labour win power.

But energy experts warned the move could choke off vital investment in power stations.

Britain needs to raise £110billion by the end of the decade to improve ageing infrastructure.

Swathes of coal power stations, which are being shut down to comply with EU rules on carbon emissions, must also be replaced.

Critics said relying on gas power, the Chancellor’s preferred tactic, will leave the UK more reliant on international gas prices, which are notoriously volatile.

Britain has traditionally been sheltered from international power prices because of gas flowing in from the North Sea.
