Former miners' leader Arthur Scargill was today awarded £13,000 in damages after he sued the union he led
for 20 years.

Mr Scargill, 74, sued the National Union
of Mineworkers Yorkshire Area Trust Fund (YATF) over a range of expenses he
claimed he was owed when he worked for them in a £26,000-a-year role after he
retired as NUM national president.

Today, a judge at Sheffield County Court
rejected the former union boss's claim that he should have had his telephone
costs reimbursed by a trust of the union.

But Judge Robert Moore ruled that Mr
Scargill was entitled to a car allowance substantially more than the £50 the
trustees eventually offered him.

He awarded him £12,000 in damages. The
judge also awarded Mr Scargill a further £1,000 in damages because he was
denied membership of the NUM for ten months during the dispute.

Judge Moore told the court that when the
trustees began to question Mr Scargill's contract, 'there was a clear agenda
both to disown him and to pay him as little as possible'.

Mr Scargill's barrister Timothy Pitt-Payne
QC said the trust treated his client 'in a thoroughly shabby way and in a way
that was quite inappropriate, given his long and distinguished career within
the union'.

The court heard that Mr Scargill took up a
role with the trust after he retired from his £70,000 post as national
president of the NUM in 2002.

Despite two trustees of the fund claiming
they did not realise he worked for them, Judge Moore said in his judgment that
Mr Scargill's work over the last decade was 'meaningful and considerable'.

The judge outlined how the former
president's expertise was used in relation to the preparation of a range of
legal cases.

He said these included an aborted attempt
to reclaim £8million from the union's former solicitors, a long-running
property dispute relating to union offices in central Sheffield, and former
miners' compensation claims regarding the condition vibration white finger, a repetitive stress injury.

The trustees disputed Mr Scargill's claim
that he was entitled to an allowance towards a new car.

The court heard that he understood this
was a benefit which carried over after he changed jobs in 2002 and was
calculated using a complex formula but amounted to 80 per cent of the cost of a Ford
Mondeo over a four-year period.

This amounted to about £14,500.

The judge was told that Mr Scargill was
paid this allowance in 2005 when he last changed his car.

But five years later, when he inquired
again, the trustees began to question the very basis of his employment contract
with YATF.

Mr Scargill, wearing a dark suit with a
red tie, sat behind his QC in court.

The case continues this afternoon when the
judge will resume his assessment of costs.
