She's the former TV journalist turned princess who is set to become Queen of Spain within weeks. But Princess Letizia is famous for more than simply being the wife of the Spanish king-in-waiting.

The 41-year-old mother-of-two has also carved out a name for herself as a royal style icon and even, on one memorable occasion, managed to outshine the ultra-glamorous Carla Bruni.

Her current wardrobe of tailored sheath dresses, sky-scraping court shoes and eye-catching jewels is all a far cry from her early days as a newsreader, when she embraced the bland Armani suit and was rarely seen in public wearing anything else.

Style reinvention: From boxy ill-fitting blazers
 to on-trend city suits, Letizia, pictured above this afternoon, has 
come a long way since her days as a newsreader

Bland:
 Before marrying in to the Spanish royal family, Letizia's newsreader 
job meant she clung faithfully to grey tailored trouser suits

But since 
marrying Felipe, Prince of Asturias, Prince of Gerona, Prince of Viana, 
Duke of Montblanc, Count of Cervera and Lord of Balaguer, in 2004, her 
wardrobe has undergone a remarkable transformation.

Out
 went grey suits and in came a more colourful, feminine style - 
although, as a recent appearance at the a reception for members of the 
Patronage of the Prince of Asturias Foundation at the Royal Palace in 
Madrid revealed, she's yet to give up the black.

So what 
are the secrets of Princess Letizia's enviable style? Like the Duchess 
of Cambridge, she knows what suits her lean body shape and is 
partial to a knee-length shift dress and a bracelet sleeve.

She
 adores a leg-lengthening nude heel and is almost as addicted to her 
Magrit suede tan court shoes as Kate is to her nude patent L.K Bennett 
'Sledge' heels.

Not so nice: In the early years of her marriage, Princess Letizia favoured frumpy jackets in unflattering pastel hues combined with big, bouffant blow dries

Old-fashioned: For her first official portrait in 2005, the then 32-year-old Letizia sported an unflattering boxy jacket - a hangover from her newsreader days

Colourful: As this 2007 photo with Morocco's Prince Muley Rachid and his sister Princess Laila Meriem reveals, Letizia has begun to embrace bright colour

All change: Letizia has admitted to having surgery on her nose in 2008, which the Palace claimed was to fix respiratory problems (pictured left 2003 and right in 2011)

The Spanish queen-in-waiting also shares
 another trait with the UK's future queen: a penchant for homegrown 
labels and the high street. In Letizia's case, that means slim-fitting 
sheath dresses picked up in Mango, Zara and Uterqüe - many of which she 
wears time and time again.

That, however, doesn't mean she won't splash out on a more expensive frock should one catch her eye. Her favourite piece is reportedly a black guipure lace dress by local designer, Felipe Varela, which she wore on a state visit to Portugal in 2012, again for her 40th birthday party and again in March this year.

Another favourite is a softly fitted yellow and royal purple print dress by Hugo Boss which made its first appearance in summer 2012 before being dusted off the following year and spruced up with a black blazer.

Off duty, the Princess' style becomes markedly more relaxed, with cropped trousers, billowing shirts and even the odd pair of jeans making up the bulk of her wardrobe.

But as her occasional foray back into grey Hugo Boss tailored trousers reveals, some style habits die hard - Queen-to-be or not.
