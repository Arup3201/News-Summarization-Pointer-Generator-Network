These are the first pictures of the victim of the South Wales measles epidemic, which has so far infected 808 people and left 77 in hospital.

A 25-year-old from Swansea, named locally as Gareth Williams, died at his home on Thursday morning.

Health officials confirmed yesterday that he did die from measles.

A statement released said: 'Public Health Wales laboratory tests have today confirmed a diagnosis of measles in a 25-year-old male from Swansea who died on Thursday 18 April.

'The tests confirm only that the deceased had measles at the time of his death. 

'Further investigations are being undertaken by the Swansea Coroner to establish the cause of death.'

The victim lived in Port Tennant Road area of the city, which is in the middle of a measles epidemic.

Confirmation of the cause of death will not be known until the results of a post mortem examination are released - possibly not until next week.

Latest figures revealed there are 808 confirmed cases of the disease in the Swansea outbreak which is starting to spread countrywide.

Health officials are investigating the death in an epidemic which has already infected more than 800 people in South Wales

The news comes as two million children risk catching  measles as a result of the MMR scare, doctors have warned.

They said the outbreak in Wales could spread to London, where nearly half of the capital’s children are not vaccinated.

The disease has already infected around 800 children in Swansea.

Dr Helen Bedford, of University College London’s Institute of Child Health, said: ‘There are about two million children who are susceptible because they haven’t been vaccinated. London is a particular case of point.’

Ten years ago, 45 per cent of five-year-olds in London failed to have the required two doses of vaccine. Last year the figure was 81 per cent.

Teenagers aged between 13 and 15 are more likely to be susceptible to measles because of the controversy over the since-discredited report about MMR jabs being linked to autism in the late 1990s.

Dr Bedford told a science conference 
in London: ‘There’s a simple message that parents need to be encouraged 
to find out if their children have been vaccinated and if not, go out 
and do it.’

Today Dr
Marion Lyons, Director of Health Protection, said: 'Public Health Wales
is aware of a death being investigated by the Swansea Coroner.

'A
diagnosis of measles has not yet been confirmed. Testing the deceased 
for measles is forming part of the investigations being overseen by the 
Coroner.

Epidemic: Doctors are urging parents to get their children immunised as a matter of urgency

'My sympathies are with the family at such a tragic time. We should not be surprised if, as the outbreak grows, we start to see deaths in Wales.

'Measles is a potentially fatal disease and around one in every 1,000 people who contracts measles in developed countries will die.'

Neighbours on the Swansea estate where Mr Williams lived in a flat learned of the potential measles link to his death this afternoon.

'I think people were under the impression that he died from an asthma attack, that is what I heard,' said one female neighbour, who did not wish to be named.

Typical symptoms of measles include fever, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash.

Complications are quite common, even in healthy people, and about 20 per cent of reported measles sufferers experience them.

These can include ear infections, vomiting and diarrhoea, pneumonia, meningitis and serious eye disorders.

'He was somebody you rarely saw, to be honest. He often used the back way into his flat so you would not even see him coming or going.

'But it was only when the police and TV cameras turned up that and it was reported on the news that anybody heard anything about measles.'

Earlier in the week, Meirion Evans a consultant epidemiologist, expressed her fears over the outbreak and said: 'There is a very real concern that we might get a death.'

She added that the number of measles cases is expected to double in the coming weeks.

Extra clinics are expected to be opened at hospitals around Swansea this weekend with health officials anticipating a rush of parents and children wanting the jab.

Health workers have also visited local schools to immunise hundreds of children.

Health officials said over 1,700 jabs were administered in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board area, which includes Swansea, Neath, Port Talbot and Bridgend.

Since the beginning of the outbreak, a total of 77 people have been hospitalised because of the contagious disease.

Many of those being treated are babies and teenagers, with the latter said to be most at risk.

The Government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Mark Walport, said it was ‘vital’ parents vaccinated their children against measles.

Referring to the scare over the safety of the triple MMR jab he said: ‘Frankly that was about a piece of extremely bad science.

It is an example of how people forget the danger of diseases such as measles, they become complacent when it appears to have disappeared.

‘But it’s just, I think, very clear evidence of the huge importance of vaccination. It was and has been one of the major interventions in public health and it’s absolutely vital that people vaccinate their children.’
