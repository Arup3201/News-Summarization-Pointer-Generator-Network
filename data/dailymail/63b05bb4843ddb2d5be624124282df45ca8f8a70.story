With his Clark Gable moustache and dishevelled wartime appearance, he may look like any other prisoner of war.

Leslie Bull's story, however, is much more remarkable, as the British Flight Lieutenant was the real prisoner upon which Steve McQueen's character is based in The Great Escape.

While the iconic scene from the 1963 film shows McQueen's PoW Virgil Hilts attempting to cross the Swiss border on a motorbike, the reality saw British officer Bull imprisoned by the Gestapo and murdered on Hitler's orders.

In the U.S. war film The Great Escape, 
McQueen's character attempts to jump a barbed wire fence at the Swiss 
border before his capture and return to a Nazi PoW camp in World War 
Two.

The details for the film's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for Flight Lieutenant Bull and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the Czech town of Most.

Unpublished images have since been found by an historian of Briton Bull, along with his other three failed escapees Squadron Leader John 'Willy' Williams, RAF Flight Officer Jerzy Mondschein and RAAF Flight Lieutenant Reginald 'Rusty' Kierath.

Movie interpretation: The Steve McQueen filmed showed his character attempt to escape the camp on a motorbike, though this was added for artistic license

Inspiration: Just like in the 1963 film (pictured) Lt Bull and fellow escapees pulled on a rope outside the camp to alert other PoWs about the nearby patrolling guard

In the pictures taken shortly after their capture, the four men all stare defiantly at the camera. Just 24 hours later they had all been executed.

Their plight does have a certain resemblance with the events of the Great Escape, however.

Research has shown that, just like in the American film, Bull sneaks out of the tunnel near the Stalag Luft III, trailing a rope so he can signal to men behind him when the patrolling guard is at a safe distance.

Guy Walters, an historian writing a book about the Great Escape, found the pictures in a war crimes file at the National Archives at Kew.

Executed: RAAF Flight Lieutenant Reginald 'Rusty' Kierath, Squadron Leader John 'Willy' Williams,  and RAF Flight Officer Jerzy Mondschein were also captured and killed along with Bull by the Gestapo

Memorial: The details for the film's inspiration emerged yesterday as a memorial for Flight Lieutenant Bull and the three fellow escapers who were killed alongside him was unveiled in the Czech town of Most

He said: 'The photos show them as terrified men.

'Within 24 hours of these photos being taken they were lying with bullet holes in their heads.'

Sombre: Soldiers flank a memorial gravestone

Allied
 airmen including Lieutenant Bull executed in cold blood after 'The 
Great Escape' breakout will be honoured on Saturday at the place in 
Most.

A Czech Air Force fly
 past is to mark the unveiling of a permanent memorial in the northern 
Bohemian city of Most on the 68th anniversary of the daring escape by 
RAF men.

Relatives of these
 four men will then follow in their footsteps, retracing their famous 
escape from Stalag Luft III to the Czechoslovakian border, where they 
were intercepted and then secretly murdered on Hitler's orders.

The
 memorial — which brings the four men’s families together for the first 
time — is the initiative of a Czech commercial pilot, Michal Holý, who 
says the men should have been recognized 'many years ago.'

'This was deliberate, calculated murder, not death on a battlefield in war,' he said.

After the war, tribunals in Hamburg and Nuremburg sentenced 20 former Gestapo officers to death for the murders and jailed many more.

However, no one was ever located or brought to justice for the execution of the four pilots near Most.
