Technically, it made no difference. Liverpool were still going to need to beat Basle, either way. Yet as Georgi Terziev rose to head in an 88th-minute equaliser, a little bit of the hoped-for Red revival died.

They couldn’t hold the lead. Again. They couldn’t get it over the line. Again.

Forget the permutations, the blow was psychological. If Liverpool take the lead at Anfield in their final group game next month, there will be no great confidence that it will be maintained. And a draw puts Basle through. One can almost feel the dread from here.

On the bright side, Liverpool are still in there fighting. Maybe they would have settled for that, coming out of the 3-0 defeat by Real Madrid. They could have gone out, too. So could a lot of teams. Ludogorets are useful.

Not one of the storied European names. Not Real Madrid; not even Liverpool. But the elite have been travelling to tricky corners of Europe like this for decades and occasionally coming unstuck. The Soviet era national stadium. The iconic oblong floodlights. Bitter cold and a horrible pitch. A classic eastern location.

We used to watch grainy footage of Liverpool in action on nights like this in the days when the competition was called the European Cup. They were never easy games. And neither was this.

Liverpool had held their lead for close to an hour when the mounting Ludogorets pressure told.

It was a corner, one of a number late on. This one found Terziev, a Bulgarian international who once had an unsuccessful trial with Newcastle United, powering his header past Simon Mignolet. At that point the hope that this would be a watershed night evaporated. Far from building confidence, it became further evidence of Liverpool’s frailty.

Mark Lawrenson got sent off here, at the Vasili Levski Stadium, in what might be termed the good old days. Now he watched from the press box, quietly anxious about the way Liverpool were being pressed back deeper by Ludogorets’ ambition. What Liverpool would give for a defender of his composure on nights like this. For a goalkeeper like Ray Clemence or even Bruce Grobbelaar, too.

From the third minute, when they fell behind, to the very end as Ludogorets pressed and pressed, Liverpool were nervy at the back.

They rode their luck a little, too. It may have been a penalty when Glen Johnson fouled Mihail Alexandrov in the second half, but referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz of Spain gave it outside the box.

Sadly, Mignolet, whose penalty save against Stoke City was a catalyst for the run that took Liverpool to within touching distance of the title last season, is no longer part of the solution, but a large slice of the problem. He was at fault for the first goal here, even if it was Kolo Toure’s initial mistake that put Liverpool on the back foot.

Toure cleared the ball straight to Marcelinho — one of five Brazilians in the Ludogorets squad — and he struck a low shot from just outside the area. It was powerful but straight and should have presented little problem for a top-class goalkeeper.

Mignolet’s attempt to gather it into his body was pitiful. The ball rebounded off his chest and striker Dani Abalo, late of Celta Vigo in Spain, was first to react, prodding it into the net from close range.

It was not the only time Mignolet’s handling caused concern. Every shot he faced he reacted to as if it had exploded out of a jack-in-the-box directly in front of him. The pitch was partly to blame for that, calling into question Liverpool’s decision to train at Melwood rather than out here. No goalkeeper will ever get used to an inconsistent bounce like this, but Mignolet might not have looked so startled each time it happened.

These were not the only nasty instances. Mignolet completely missed a cross into his box in the first half — and thankfully so did everybody else — while Toure almost put a low ball from Alexandrov into his own net.

Liverpool can only advance to the round of 16 if they beat Basle at Anfield on the final matchday.

Remaining games: December 9 - Liverpool vs Basle, Real Madrid vs Ludogorets.

In the 33rd minute, a shot from 30 yards by Fabio Espinho pitched in a rough patch and almost biffed Mignolet on the nose as he sought to collect it. By then, Liverpool were wobbling.

This being a charmed week for English clubs in Europe, however, eight minutes before half-time, Brendan Rodgers’ team were ahead.

Ludogorets had probably edged the action, but like Manchester City against Bayern Munich, fortune favoured the English and Ludogorets let them back into the game with two errors: the second a lapse, but the first a real horror show.

Jordan Henderson played a long, rather aimless, ball into the box, but it seemed to catch goalkeeper Vladislav Stoyanov and defender Cosmin Moti in two minds — and neither of them were worthy of an application to MENSA.

Moti dawdled, Stoyanov froze and Rickie Lambert popped in between them and sent a header on a gentle trajectory into the far corner. It was the sort of goal that had the whole stadium looking to the linesman, expecting to see the flag that had signalled for play to stop. There was none.

Ludogorets were truly that dozy: and five minutes after going behind, Liverpool were level again. They created little after that, though, and a shot from Raheem Sterling that rose high over the bar seemed to sum up the difference in form from last season.

Yet with 37 minutes gone, Liverpool got the goal that should have changed the dynamic of their campaign. It came around the time that, over in Basle, Cristiano Ronaldo was giving Real Madrid the lead to greatly improve Liverpool’s chances of progress — and while Henderson could not have known the news, he responded to Sterling’s cross with an urgency that implied he did.

Henderson has never scored for England and one might ask why, considering the Lampardesque energy he displayed to arrive at the far post here, timing his run perfectly and finishing from a tight angle to give Liverpool a gasp of breathing space.

The marking could have been tighter, but that was true at either end. For Liverpool, however, the defensive problem is growing. The starting point against Basle is a clean sheet — yet who has any confidence of the night finishing that way?
