A whistleblower broke down in tears today as he described the 'terrible' moment he witnessed a professor allegedly viewing child porn in first class on board a flight.

Kurt Wade was sitting behind University of Utah professor Grant Smith on a Delta flight from Salt Lake City, Utah to Boston on Saturday.

He says he was stunned when Smith began scrolling through images of naked girls as young as five - and immediately alerted a flight attendant.

'Terrible stuff': Kurt Wade, pictured, speaks out about witnessing a fellow first-class passenger viewing child porn. He immediately alerted authorities

He even took a picture of the 47-year-old looking at his screen as proof.

'He kept scrolling through the pictures 
and they became sexual and explicit,' he told Fox News.

'Little by little they were 
semi-nude, then completely nude. Just terrible, terrible stuff.

'It was kind of sad. Tough stuff to see.'

Smith, of Cottonwood Heights, Utah, was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport.

The father of two appeared 
in court on Monday and pleaded not guilty. He has been held on $75,000 cash bail.

Emotional: Wade said he could not get the horrific images out his head

Mr Wade said the experience was extremely distressing.

'Even as I was trying to explain it [to an air steward], I broke down. I couldn't contain it. So disturbing what was going on.'

He added: 'When I was in the interview room with forensic computer police down the
 hall, they confirmed for me there were other images of sexual activity 
with grown ups.'

When asked if he considered himself a hero, he added: 'No. I think any common sense person would see this and understand what was going on.'

Speaking to the Associated Press, Wade added: ‘I feel bad for a lot of people but mostly for these innocent girls. He’s got two young kids and these kids are innocent victims of their father’s behaviour.’

During the court appearance on Monday, the prosecutor described the events leading to Smith's arrest.

In court: Grant Smith, 47, is pictured in court on Monday as he's arraigned. He allegedly watched child porn on his university issued laptop while flying first class

'Disturbing': Professor Smith is the father of two children. He has been put on leave by the University of Utah, where he has worked for 14 years

He said a flight attendant confronted Smith and told him to shut off his laptop - bought by a 
grant from the university.

Smith then allegedly tried to delete the offending images from his computer.

The images were mostly of girls between eight and 10 years old, naked or nearly naked, engaging in simulated sex acts.

'These
 weren't photos of a child in the bath that a parent might keep,' 
Suffolk County District Attorney Daniel Conley said of the images.

'These were explicitly sexual and extremely disturbing.'

Some of the pictures were of children as young as six, the prosecutor said.

Accused: Smith was arrested at Boston Logan International Airport where police allegedly found images of naked girls as young as five on his laptop

State Police met Smith’s flight and 
allegedly discovered 'disturbing images of child pornography' on the 
laptop, according to State Police spokesman David Procopio.

Attorney and victim's advocate Wendy 
Murphy told WCVB: 'The notion that someone would be so bold as to view 
it in public is extraordinary and I'm not sure what the explanation is.

'What we have is the equivalent 
of a confession. Someone who not only sees it but is smart enough to 
take a picture of it is very solid evidence.

'Reporting
 it immediately to law enforcement, law enforcement then being able to 
do their own immediate investigation - that's a very strong case - at 
least at this point.'

Investigators from Massachusetts State 
Police told NewsCenter 5's Cheryl Fiandaca that Smith was travelling to Boston to attend a 
conference for the Material Research Society.

Smith, a materials 
science and engineering professor, has two bachelor’s degrees and a doctorate, and has worked at the university for 14 years.

Forced out: The University of Utah, where Smith has taught for 14 years, has put him on leave. If the allegations prove true, he will be dismissed

On his court appearance, he stared 
into the distance and did not speak. His lawyer entered the not-guilty 
plea before Judge Kenneth Desmond.

The University of Utah has placed Smith on administrative leave pending the criminal investigation.

'Professor Smith deserves a full and fair investigation into this issue,' the statement said.

'The
 University of Utah, however, has no tolerance for the viewing or 
possessing of child pornography by any of its employees, regardless of 
where it occurs.'

If the allegations prove true, he will be immediately dismissed.

Smith has a pretrial hearing set for December 27.
