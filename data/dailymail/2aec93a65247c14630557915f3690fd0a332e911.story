A city trader who conned more than £316million from wealthy investors to fund a luxurious lifestyle has been jailed for 13 years.

Nicholas Levene, 48, ran a 'Ponzi' fraud scheme which he spent on private jets, super yachts, a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot and on hosting £10,000-a-day pheasant shoots.

The smooth-talking son of an electrician, nicknamed Beano because of his love of the comic, tricked some of Britain's most successful businessmen into parting with cash.

But in the end it all came crashing down.

In a letter to the court, Levene's own father described his son's lifestyle as 'beyond comprehension and 
understanding explained only by that monster, greed'.

The city-boy's fraud was brought to and end when investors started legal proceedings resulting in his bankruptcy and arrest

Among his victims were Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, who lost £10million.

Richard Caring, owner of the Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in London, was also tricked into handing over the same sum, although it is unclear how much, if any, he recouped.

Levene told clients he would make them huge profits, claiming he had access to shares which were unavailable to ordinary investors.

He would from time to time give them 
smaller sums of cash to maintain the illusion that he was delivering 
them profits. In total, he took £316million.

The Serious Fraud Office discovered he lost £32million of that between April 2005 and September 2009. 

With interest and potential profits taken into consideration, the clients are believed to have lost out by £101.6million. 

Levene,
 a former deputy chairman of Leyton Orient Football Club, spent more 
than £18million on his playboy lifestyle, habitually chartering private 
jets and yachts, staying in the penthouse suites of five-star hotels and
 buying properties for family members.

The
 fraudster spent £588,000 on his second son's Bar Mitzvah celebration, 
which featured a performance by girl band The Saturdays.

His
 main house was a £2million eight-bedroom property in Barnet, North 
London, where he lived with his wife Tracy and their three children.

He also owned a £5million villa in 
Israel which he decorated with fine art, including at least one work by 
modernist painter Chagall.

He used £58.5million of his clients' money to place huge bets on the stock market.

Frivolous: Levene also bought a £150,000-a-year box at Ascot (pictured) and gambled large amounts on sport

Stagecoach co-founder Ann Gloag was one of the high profile victims of Levene's fraud

He also gambled large amounts on sport, once losing £720,000 on a single Twenty20 cricket match in 2008.

During
 the economic boom years he was able to pay clients, but when the stock 
market crashed he resorted to duping new investors.

Commonly known as a 'Ponzi' scheme, his type of scam repays investors out of their own money or that of subsequent investors.

The fraud was brought to an end when investors started legal proceedings which resulted in his arrest and bankruptcy.

Levene had already pleaded guilty at a previous hearing to 12 counts of fraud, one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception, and one count of false accounting.

Jailing him at Southwark Crown Court yesterday, Judge Martin Beddoe told Levene he had carried out a 'determined and utterly dishonest course of offending for your own aggrandisement'.

'You were truly addicted to greed and a lifestyle that you did not really have the skills or imagination to achieve,' he said.

'The sums are staggering...it has involved so many acts and moments of betrayal of people who... clearly believed they were your friends.' 

The £316 million that Nicholas Levene conned from people was made up of cash from some of the UK's most influential and successful people.

Among his victims were Stagecoach Group's co-founders, brother and sister Sir Brian Souter and Ann Gloag, who lost £10million.

And Richard
 Caring (right), owner of the Ivy and Le Caprice restaurants in London, was also
 tricked into handing over the same sum and he may not have got any of it back.

Caring is nicknamed ‘the coat hanger king’ and lives in a vast 
Hampstead house dubbed ‘the Versailles of London’.

His club Annabel’s in Mayfair is the only nightclub which can boast it once had the Queen as a guest.

His wealth was valued at around £450 million, and he is close to being in the 100 wealthiest people in Britain.

He made his money from flooding high street fashion chains 
with clothes made in the Far East, supplying, among others, his great friend, Topshop boss Sir Philip Green.

Despite having no experience in 
restaurants, he then built up a collection of some of the most famous 
dining rooms in Britain.

In 2005, he paid £31.5 million for Signature Restaurants, which owned
 The Ivy, J Sheekey and Le Caprice.

The group also operates the 
relaunched Scott's, as well as Daphne's, Bam-Bou and the Rivington 
Grill. He went on to buy Annabel's nightclub, along with Harry's Bar and
 Mark's Club when he bought the Birley Group for £102million last June. 
In January, he completed a £105 million deal to take a Soho House chain.
