Porn could come to Google Glass as early as this week, with the first X- rated app set to be launched for those who have the Â£1,000 gadget.

Porn directors last week announced plans to use Google Glass eyewear for X-rated films to explore the 'full potential' of the technology.

Now the Android adult app store MiKandi has reportedly confirmed it is already making content to be viewed on the wearable computer, and it could ready within the next few days.

Excited: Porn directors are looking forward to trying out Google Glasses as a new way to shoot adult films. Here Google co-founder Sergey Brin poses in a pair the highly coveted technology

It is likely to be another 
embarrassing revelation for Google, which has faced somewhat of a 
backlash over their latest technology.

Cafe owners, cinemas and strip clubs 
in the US have already announced they are banning the technology from 
their premises out of respect for customer's privacy.

MiKandi produces hundreds of 'not safe for work' (NSFW) and adult apps.

CNET reports it is seeking to create 
content with Glass as well as for Glass, and the company said users can 
expect to see the first Glass app as soon as this week.

MiKandi told ZDNet - CNET sister site: 'Google Glass Porn has been making its rounds, and while studios are intrigued, no one seems to be doing anything about it.

'So I wanted to let you know that we picked up our Glass and, yup, we're making content for it.'

Chiefs from the adult film industry 
last week said they were interested in using the wearable computers for 
point-of-view shots.

They said it would allow them to operate in a 'truly hands-free fashion' as opposed to having one hand on the camera.

Google
 Glass has caused concern because it has a camera next to the wearer's 
eye which can take photos or record video without a red light or a 
shutter sound to tell others that it is working

Casinos
 said they could help cheaters to win unfairly and cinemas said that 
they could be used to illegally record films and sell pirate copies.

Parks
 departments and banks across America are also waiting to see how the 
new technology is used before deciding whether or not to ban them.

Google's
 chairman Eric Schmidt once admitted that the aim with technology like 
Google Glass was to 'go right up to the creepy line and not cross it'.

But
 the public clearly feels differently and in France those wearing Google
 Glass style specs have been subjected to 'cyber discrimination'.

University
 of Toronto computer engineering professor Steve Mann was at a 
McDonald's restaurant in Paris when he claims an employee tried to 
physically remove a similar gadget he designed from his head.

Amateur producers are also said to be especially keen
 to get their hands on a pair as they shoot high quality video and make 
it even easier to film home porn movie.

Google Glass costs $1,500 a pair and is currently on limited release to 2,000 people.

It will be more widely available later this year or in 2014.

Q
 Boyer, a spokesman for porn film makers Pink Visual, said last week: 
'To really know their full potential, we'll need to get a pair to play 
around with, but we're already dreaming up ways to use the glasses to 
get shots (sex-related and otherwise) that just aren't feasible using a 
traditional camera setup.

'Obviously
 a device that allows you to shoot high-quality video in a truly 
hands-free fashion will make shooting point of view (POV) porn that much
 easier'.

Porn actress Alana Evans has already said it would spark a 'huge drive' in POV filming.

And
 Missy Martinez, another porn actress, has said it could lead to a slew 
of 'gonzo-style' movies from amateurs with no experience.

Dave
 Meinert, the proprietor of the 5 Point Cafe in Seattle, has said the 
those wearing the specs will have to take them off if they want to come 
in.

He has placed a sign on the wall which reads: 'Respect our customers' privacy as we'd expect them to respect yours'.

Cinemas have said they do not want the technology as people may be able to film new releases and distribute pirate copies.

And Lap dance clubs said that they would treat those wearing the Internet-connected specs the same as anyone caught filming a stripper with a cameraphone - and would kick them out.
