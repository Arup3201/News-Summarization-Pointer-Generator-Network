One of the teenage victims of the Zanzibar acid attack still has to wear a pressure bandage on her agonising wounds for 23 hours a day, it was revealed yesterday.

Kirstie Trup, who has started university, will have to wear the bandages for a year to ease the pain and control scarring.

But four months after the assault, the  culprits remain at large.

Liquid from car batteries, including highly corrosive sulphuric acid, was hurled at Kirstie and Katie Gee, both 18, while they were volunteering as teachers at a Anglican-affiliated orphanage on the African island.

The North London teenagers were 
targeted by two men on a moped as they walked back from a restaurant on 
the predominantly Muslim island on August 7.

Yesterday
 Kirstie’s father, Marc Trup, and Doug Morris, the partner of Katie’s 
mother Nicky Gee, told of their frustration at the slow progress in the 
case. They called for the Government to put more pressure on the 
authorities in Tanzania, which has overall control of the 
semi-autonomous island.

Mr 
Trup, 51, a multimillionaire dental surgeon and property developer, said
 his daughter was ‘progressing well mentally and physically’ after 
suffering severe burns to her shoulder and back.

He told Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘Kirstie is doing well, she’s moved to university. 

Still recovering: Miss Trup, left, suffered chemical burns to her shoulder and back from the acid attack; Miss Gee, right, was more badly hurt, suffering burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her torso

‘She
 is still having treatment at the local hospital. She has to wear a 
pressure garment over her burns, which she has to wear 23 hours a day 
for one whole year.

‘She 
goes once a week to hospital for physiotherapy on her burns, but she’s 
progressing well physically and mentally – she appears to be moving 
well.’

But he added that she still has ‘difficult times’.

Mr
 Morris said he expected the Foreign Office to ‘move hell and high 
water’ to bring the attackers to justice but that there did not seem to 
be ‘any sense of urgency to conclude matters’.

Mr Trup added: ‘I’m particularly upset with the Tanzanian authorities. I think they just hope this  will go away.

‘The
 Foreign Office do send us emails, but the emails say the same every 
single time and they seem  to imply that the British Foreign Office has 
clout, it has a voice, but clearly none of that is working because we 
are not getting any progress whatsoever.

‘I
 would like to see whoever threw that acid brought to justice. I don’t 
blame the country, I don’t blame the religion. I blame the person. He 
needs to be brought to justice.

‘Above
 all, the girls want to know why he did it and we would like to know why
 he did it. Was it racial, was it a religious thing? We have no idea why
 this person did it.’

Police
 in Zanzibar have interviewed several people, including eyewitnesses, 
and are believed to have identified a possible culprit.

But Mr Trup said there is still confusion over how to get a photograph of a suspect to their daughters for identification.

‘The
 photograph cannot be sent in the correct format that is acceptable by 
Interpol, or the British authorities, and as a consequence of that 
nobody has seen the  photo,’ he said.

Mr Morris said Katie is ‘remarkable … very strong mentally and just coping with the process of healing’.

He added: ‘This crime can’t go unpunished, for the girls’ sake as much as anything else.

‘What sort of message is that, that you can do something horrific, you can do something horrible, and you can get away with it?’
