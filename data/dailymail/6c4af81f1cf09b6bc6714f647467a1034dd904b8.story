A bus carrying more than 50 wedding guests was swept away by a flooded stream in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir and all but three of the passengers are missing, officials said.

Police officer Rajesh Kumar said the three swam to safety and told rescuers that about 50 others were trapped in the bus.

Rescuers were searching for the bus but have not been able to locate it in the gushing waters. New landslides and heavy rains blocked access to the area, Mr Kumar said.

Some people were forced to take refuge on the roof of their home as the flood waters continued to rise following the worst rains in the past 22 years 

Within a matter of minutes, the flood waters rose up to chest height, forcing the evacuation of large areas of Srinagar with more than 5,000 people fleeing to safety 

Officials earlier said the bus was carrying about 70 people. 'There is a lot of confusion,' Mr Kumar said.

The Press Trust of India news agency said the bride and bridegroom were among the missing people who were returning home from a wedding ceremony in a village in the Rajouri region, about 110 miles south west of Srinagar, the main city in the Indian-held portion of Kashmir.

The region's wedding season has been disrupted by heavy rains and the worst floods in 22 years, and many ceremonies have been postponed.

At least 18 people have died in the past two days, and authorities have closed schools and stopped train services in the Kashmir valley. Meteorologists said the heavy rains were likely to continue for another two days.

Police officer Imtiyaz Hussain said the 18 victims were swept away by floodwaters or buried by mud from mountain slopes - 14 in the Jammu region and four in the Kashmir valley. They included a paramilitary officer whose bunker collapsed on him.

Soldiers and rescue workers used boats to move thousands of people to higher ground. At least 100 villages across the Kashmir valley were flooded by overflowing lakes and rivers, including the Jhelum river, which was up to four feet above its danger level, officials said.

Landslides and floods are common in India during the monsoon season, which runs from June through September.

Parts of Srinagar were also flooded. In Bemina, a large neighbourhood, thousands of residents waded through ankle-high water that entered their homes.

Authorities evacuated 5,000 people from the neighbourhood and 100 others were believed to be stranded there.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan and claimed by both. They have fought three wars, two of them over control of Kashmir, since winning independence from Britain in 1947.
