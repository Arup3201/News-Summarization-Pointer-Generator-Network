More than 600 devastated relatives and friends today paid their respects to a UPenn track star who jumped to her death from a parking garage as she struggled with the pressures of school work.

Mourners comforted Madison Holleran's father, James, as he left the snow-covered Guardian Angel Church in Allendale, New Jersey after the funeral service on Tuesday.

Other relatives and friends - some of whom had taken a bus chartered from Penn in Philadelphia - were seen sobbing as they struggled to come to terms with the popular student's passing.

During the mass, Mr Holleran said that his daughter used to rally her team by saying: 'Now is a time to be strong.' He added: 'Today, we all have to be strong for Madison.'

He then urged the congregation to learn from the loss of an 'iconic' young woman: 'Please seek therapy if you need it. This is not a weakness, but a struggle.'

He also led them in the Serenity Prayer, saying: 'God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can and the wisdom to know the difference.'

Madison's older sister Ashley struggled to contain her tears as she called her sister 'the best snuggle buddy I could have asked for'.

'Even though she was my little sister I looked up to her as a mentor,' Ashley said, NJ.com reported. 'I only wish I could have flown up to her at UPenn and helped her.'

Her teammates from high school walked beside her casket as it was carried from the church, The Record reported.

Ahead of the funeral, her family asked well-wishers to donate to 
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention in lieu of flowers. She will be cremated.

The death of the 19-year-old sports star rocked the UPenn community and Allendale, where she grew up with four siblings.

Her father old the New York Post that she had been struggling with her school workload while a family friend 
revealed her supportive parents told her she could stay home or transfer
 at Christmas.

But sadly the determined teen insisted on going back.

On Friday evening, she posted an image of a sunset over Rittenhouse Square to 
her Instagram account - but an hour later, she plunged from the roof of a parking garage to her death.

Her
 father said that she killed herself because she was 
overwhelmed with schoolwork at UPenn.

'There
 was a lot more pressure in the classroom at Penn,' Mr Holleran tearfully told 
the Post. 'She wasn't normal happy Madison. Now she had worries and 
stress.'

Mr Holleran said that she had told her parents in December that she was feeling suicidal and was seeing a therapist.

'We
 knew she needed help,' he said. 'She knew she needed help. She had lost
 confidence in academics and she also lost confidence in her track 
abilities.'

On the day that 
she jumped to her death, her father texted her that morning encouraging 
her to see a therapist for some anti-depressants, and she said she 
would.

But just hours later,
 she took her life. She left her parents a note and gifts for her family
 on top of the parking garage before she jumped. Her family would not 
detail the contents of the note.

Mr Holleran said that he did not blame the school for his daughter's suicide but that he wanted to warn other parents.

Family friend Bob Weckworth said the high-achiever ultimately couldn't cope with the expectations she'd set herself.

'People
 talked to her within hours of her act of suicide and there were no red 
flags, warning signs, nothing,' he told the Daily News.

'There
 were no mental health issues in her background. It was just the last 
two, three weeks where they saw a change in her. Something snapped.'

He added that while she had achieved a 3.5 GPA in her first semester, she did not see that as good enough.

'She
 was not happy at Penn,' he added. 'The parents had told her then, 
"Don't go back. We'll transfer. We'll look at other schools. There's no 
reason to go back, it's OK".'

Holleran
 was a member of the university's varsity track and field team at UPenn.

'The
 entire Penn community is deeply saddened by the death of Madison 
Holleran,' Penn president Amy Gutmann said in the statement.

'She
 was bright and well-liked with an incredible future ahead of her. There
 are simply no words that can properly convey the sense of heartache 
that we all feel at such a tragic loss.'

Holleran,
 who was majoring in philosophy, politics and economics, had been a 
standout track and soccer athlete in her high school.

She originally planned to play soccer at Lehigh University before switching her mind, and choosing to run at Penn.

She had been named to the 
New Jersey Star-Ledger's all-state girls track team last year, while the Record 
named her its Spring Athlete of the Season and Girls Indoor Track Athlete of the Year in 2013, the Star Ledger reported.

Northern Highlands Girls Varsity Soccer, for which Holleran had played, tweeted: 'RIP
 Madison. You are our beloved NHGS sister forever and always. You have 
and always will be such a special person. We love you.'

The tragedy is the third undergraduate death at UPenn since the start of winter break, the Daily Pennsylvanian reported.

Senior
 Kevin Zhao died while traveling with his family in China over the break
 while junior Pulkit Singh died last Sunday in his off-campus house.
