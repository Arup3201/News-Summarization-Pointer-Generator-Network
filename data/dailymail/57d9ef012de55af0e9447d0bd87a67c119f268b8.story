A couple who wed shortly after running last year's Boston Marathon have paid a touching tribute to those killed and injured in the atrocity by naming their newborn baby after the site of the double bombing.

Robert and Kelli Watling from Dallas, Texas, wore trainers and their marathon medals when they married in a city park just four hours after completing the race.

But just moments after the ceremony began the two bombs exploded leaving three people dead and injuring an estimated 264 others.

Tribute: Marathon runners Robert Watling and Kelli Johnston, marry just hours after completing last year's Boston Marathon. Yesterday they announced the birth of a baby daughter

Despite confusion all around, the couple and their families decided to go ahead with the wedding.

And yesterday they celebrated the birth of a baby girl who they have named Alexandra Copley Watling.

Copley Square was the site of the finish line where the two pressure cooker bombs exploded.

'At that time, we still weren't sure who did this or why. If it was a terrorist act, we certainly weren't going to let them derail our plans,' Kelli told NECN earlier this year.

The couple, who ran the Boston Marathon again this year, met at a coffee shop in 2011 and have completed many races together since

The couple had both crossed the finish line before the bombs went off 12 seconds apart on Boylston Street at around 2.50pm.on April 15th last year.

The blasts claimed the lives of three people, including eight-year-old Martin Richard.

Despite the scenes of carnage, the couple opted to go ahead with their low-key ceremony at 6.20pm in the park.

The devoted runners - who ran a 5K together on their first date - had been planning the ceremony since Mr Watling popped the question after they completed the Chicago Marathon.

Mr Watling had the engagement ring with him during the race but waited until a few hours after the race to propose on the advice of friends.

Alexandra was born on September 16 at 10:26am weighing a healthy 5 pounds, 6 ounces.
