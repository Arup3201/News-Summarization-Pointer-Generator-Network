NHS nurse Mark Preece who took time off work sick so that he could work as an extra in an action movie

An NHS nurse who acted like he had a bad back in order to moonlight as an extra in a Hollywood blockbuster has been prosecuted.

Film-lover Mark Preece, 33, told hospital managers he had a back injury which prevented him from carrying out his duties as a community nurse.

But a court heard that while on fully-paid sick leave, starstruck Preece took a part as an extra in the action movie 'Wrath of the Titans' starring Liam Neeson.

Instead of caring for the sick, Preece
was rubbing shoulders with the famous cast including Ralph Fiennes and 
Avatar star Sam Worthington.

And
as well as picking up his NHS sick pay, Preece was also paid by the 
casting company for his role as a soldier in the battles scenes.

Prosecutor Ruth Hale said: 'He even lied to a doctor so he could get a sick note to cover for the days he spent on set.'

Preece went on the sick after he found 
out the film was being made in a quarry at Trefil, near Tredegar, South 
Wales, less than 20 miles from his home.

Magistrates heard how he filmed epic 
battles for the box office smash - and spent days clambering around a 
quarry shooting scenes for the fantasy romp.

But instead of the Wrath of the Titans, Preece faced the wrath of his bosses after they were tipped-off.

He was sacked from his job as a community nurse and prosecuted for fraud.

Preece of Ebbw Vale, Gwent, pleaded 
guilty to fraud by false representation, fraud by failing to disclose 
information and obtaining services dishonestly.

He
was also sentenced to 180 hours unpaid work and ordered to pay £400 
investigative costs and £100 prosecution costs at Caerphilly Magistrates
Court.

After the trial a spokesman for his 
former employers, Aneurin Bevan Health Board said: 'The general public 
may feel that there is a humorous element to this case.

'But the reality of the matter is that this individual’s conduct defrauded funds from the public purse.

'Any such loss of funds could ultimately have a detrimental impact on patient care and patient services.

'This
type of conduct on the part of an NHS employee is dishonest, 
indefensible and unacceptable and the NHS will take appropriate action.'
