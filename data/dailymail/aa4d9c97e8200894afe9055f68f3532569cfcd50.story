Paul Lambert had just finished holding court when he spun on his heels and made his way out of Anfield’s press auditorium.

Aston Villa’s manager grabbed at the handle of the first door he saw and immediately marched through it before he had to abruptly halt. The door in question led into a pantry and, with a wry smile, he was forced to double back. It was the only wrong move he made all day.

In the moments beforehand, Lambert had conducted himself with class and dignity. There was no boasting or revelling in a triumph over Liverpool but it was clear from spending time in his company that this was a man bursting with pride at a job well done.

No wonder. Lambert enjoys visiting Anfield — in five trips with Celtic (as a player), Norwich and Villa, he has yet to be beaten — but there was more to this than merely savouring Gabby Agbonlahor’s solitary strike. Here, he felt, was a performance to show his side are coming of age.

‘These young players have become men this season,’ said Lambert, extolling the displays in particular of Nathan Baker and Ashley Westwood. ‘If they can grow together and we get one or two back from injury we’ll be really strong.’

The last few years have been fallow at Villa Park and Lambert has had to ride some punches but, suddenly, things appear to be falling into place.

Liverpool might have dominated possession but Lambert had Villa immaculately drilled.

Baker, for one, marshalled his defence, Westwood held the midfield together with exemplary passing and, around him, Tom Cleverley, Kieran Richardson and Andreas Weimann buzzed with intent.

‘It is early days but the chairman’s come out and said what he’s said (about selling),’ Lambert continued. ‘Everybody knows the situation and that’s helped. It’s galvanised the supporters who’ve been brilliant since I’ve been here.

‘Since the start of the season we have been fantastic. This is another clean sheet. But it’s a long road. ’

Retaining perspective won’t be an issue. Lambert deals in pragmatism, while his assistant, Roy Keane, emerged from the dugout at key moments, growling at Villa’s midfielders to retain their focus.

If all was right in the world for Lambert, the same could not be said for Brendan Rodgers. Liverpool’s defending continues to alarm and questions persist over the suitability of Simon Mignolet and Mamadou Sakho to this project.

Gabby Agbonlahor's goal early in the first half was enough to give Aston Villa a well-deserved victory

The goal Liverpool conceded was wretched, a sequence of errors — first from Sakho conceding a corner, then from Dejan Lovren — allowed Philippe Senderos to cause havoc before Agbonlahor pounced. If they are to progress domestically and in Europe, they must be more robust.

‘We have to defend better,’ said Rodgers. ‘Just defend — don’t try and be clever. The worst-case scenario when we have days when we are not creative we get a point and move on. It’s disappointing we didn’t.’

Super Stat: This was a rare victory for Villa’s defence in front of the Kop — the first time in 14 visits that they have kept a clean sheet.
