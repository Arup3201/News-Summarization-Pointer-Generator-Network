Breaking into a hotel room in Majorca as its occupants slept seemed like a good idea to thief Mohammed Boujida.

Unfortunately he woke the guests â€“ three British policemen.

Moroccan Boujida, 21, had forced open the officers' hotel window before climbing in and sifting through their belongings.

After a struggle - in which the thief attempted to flee and fainted in the process - he was handed over to Spanish colleagues, who were not hard to find as the hotel in the Santa Ponsa area was packed with police taking part in an international football tournament.

The event is now in its second year and attracts more than 1,000 officers from 28 countries including those from Italy, the US and Britain - the latter of which is fielding six teams.

It transpired that those targeted by the thief work for the British Transport Police.

A
source said: 'The officers involved have managed to see the funny side 
of things. The thief definitely targeted the wrong room and the wrong 
town that night.'

Boujida pleaded guilty to attempted burglary in a court in Palma and was sentenced to eight months in prison.
