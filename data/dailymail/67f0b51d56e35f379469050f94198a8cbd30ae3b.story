Drama in the writer's room: Aaron Sorkin (pictured) kicked a writer out of a script-writing session after she protested a sub-plot about campus rape which aired in this week's penultimate episode of The Newsroom 

A writer on Aaron Sorkin's soon-to-end HBO series The Newsroom, says she was kicked out of a script-writing session when she objected to a controversial story line about rape on college campuses which aired on this week's episode. 

And now Sorkin, who came to fame writing A Few Good Men and The West Wing, says he's 'disappointed' writer Alena Smith violated the privacy of the writer's room. 

Sunday night's penultimate episode featured a sub-plot about a news producer dispatched to Princeton University to pre-interview a rape victim for the fictional nightly news show.

The sub-plot's subject matter was especially sensitive considering the timing of the episode, airing just days after Rolling Stone issued an apology for their 'misplacement of trust' in a University of Virginia student, whose account of being gang raped at a campus fraternity is now in question.

The Newsroom scene follows show producer Don Keefer (played by Thomas Sadoski) speaking with a female student who set up a website that lets rape victims like her report their attackers' names anonymously.

Their conversation largely covers how campus rape is under-prosecuted by law enforcement and universities alike, and the journalistic ethics of reporting a rapist's name when the suspect has not been charged. 

While Don told the victim he believed her story, he finished the interview by urging her against coming on the show since he was 'morally obligated' as a journalist to consider the rapist innocent until proven guilty in a court of law.

Viewers and critics were mostly aligned online, in their tweets criticizing Don's extreme care in covering both sides of the story, which ends up silencing the victim.

Apparently The Newsroom writers had a similar debate when they were writing the story months ago. 

Writer Alena Smith, who joined the show's writing staff for the third and final season, revealed on Twitter that she had been kicked out of a script-writing session when she disagreed with show creator Aaron Sorkin's decision to push forward with the rape story.

'So when I tried to argue, in the writers' room, that we maybe skip the story line where a rape victim gets interrogated by a random man...I ended up getting kicked out of the room and screamed at,' Smith wrote.

'I found the experience quite boring. I wanted to fight with Aaron about the NSA, not gender. I didn't like getting cast in this outdated role,' she added, referring to another plot line in the episode about NSA leaker Edward Snowden. 

Sorkin himself later responded to Smith's comments, and admitted that he did 'excuse' her from the writing room. 

'I heard Alena’s objections and there was some healthy back and forth. After a while I needed to move on (there’s a clock ticking) but Alena wasn’t ready to do that yet. I gave her more time but then I really needed to move on. Alena still wouldn’t let me do that so I excused her from the room,' Sorkin told Mediaite. 

However, Sorkin says he was surprised to hear Smith's unhappiness about the episode, since he went on to write another draft of the script that she allegedly gave her 'enthusiastic support'. 

He added that he was disappointed that Smith broke the confidentiality of the writer's room by tweeting about the episode. 

'It was a room in which people felt safe enough to discuss private and intimate details of their lives in the hope of bringing dimension to stories that were being pitched. That’s what happens in writers rooms and while ours was the first one Alena ever worked in, the importance of privacy was made clear to everyone on our first day of work and was reinforced constantly. I’m saddened that she’s broken that trust,' Sorkin said. 

This isn't the first time Sorkin has made the news, with his show about the news. When The Newsroom debuted in 2012, he was largely criticized for his one-dimensional portrayal of female characters - especially a gossip reporter character he allegedly modeled off a woman he dated who worked for the New York Post's Page Six.

Finale: The Newsroom, which follows a team of journalists putting on a fictional nightly news show, will air it's final episode next Sunday. Above, main character Will McAvoy, played by Jeff Daniels
