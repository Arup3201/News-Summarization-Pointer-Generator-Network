A collection of never-seen-before photographs chronicling JFK's presidential campaign and time in office has come to light half a century after he was assassinated.

Key moments caught on camera include his first meeting with US Army leaders after his election to president in 1961 and an informal meeting with journalists in the Oval Office.

A series of candid snaps document a visit from British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan to the White House, a trip that began a close friendship between the two leaders.

The collection also features photos from Kennedy's campaign trail including a barbecue with supporters in Omaha and a civil rights rally in Los Angeles.

The revealing images were taken by Jacques Lowe, JFK's personal photographer, from his time as a senator in 1958 through his presidency to his untimely funeral in 1963.

They feature in a new book My Kennedy Years, a collection of more than 250 photos capturing the personal and political life of one of history's most famous characters.

Lowe was hired by JFK after impressing the Kennedy family with his photographs of elder brother Bobby in the late 1950s.

He passed away in 2001 aged 71, leaving his vast archive to his daughter Thomasina.

Tragically a cache of thousands of his negatives were destroyed just months later in the September 11 attacks in New York.

The book has been put together in honour of Lowe's work and released to mark 50 years since JFK's death.

My Kennedy Years is published by Thames and Hudson and costs 24.95 pounds.

Thomasina, 45, who lives in Kentish Town, London, said: 'Through the casual nature of my father's photos it feels like you're sat there at the table with the Kennedys.

'They were very trusting with him and put no restrictions on what he could photograph.

'Despite being welcomed into the Kennedy family my father was very modest about his relationship with them.

'When I was a child Ethel Kennedy would phone our house but dad would get very annoyed if we thought of them as celebrities.

'He would pick his moments to talk about his time with JFK.

'Even years after JFK and Bobby were assasinated he found it very hard to come to terms with it.

'However he did describe it as one of the most exciting and exhiliarating times of his life.

'My father left this great body of work behind that he wanted me to make sure was out there.

'I feel very proud of this book and of my father's work.'
