Human remains have been found at the site of the wreck of the Costa Concordia, a week after the cruise liner was wrenched from the sea-bed.

Divers have been combing the ship and surrounding areas for the bodies of Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Indian crew member Russel Rebello since the ship was judged sufficiently secure for investigation on Tuesday.

Mrs Trecarichi and Mr Rebello are presumed to have drowned along with 30 others when the vessel capsized off the Italian coast in January 2012.

Searching: Italian Fire Brigade Divers meet yesterday for an operational briefing to search for Costa Concordia victims

Missing: Yesterday the search resumed for the missing bodies of Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Russel Rebello, whose bodies were never found after the Costa Concordia capsized on January 13

Last week, following a 19-hour 
operation to right the ship, the families of the two remaining missing 
victims arrived on the island of Giglio in the hope that their loved 
ones' remains would be found.

Franco
Gabrielli of Italy’s civil protection agency said the bones had been 
discovered in an area that had previously been identified as of major 
interest.

He said: ‘On first impression they seem to be the remains of the people we are looking for.’

DNA tests are yet to begin, with the Civil Protection agency saying the identification process will take at least a week.

The bones were found beneath the ship on the seabed this morning, sources told news agency Adnkronos.

As it was: The Costa Concordia lay on its side for more than a year before rescuers were able to move it

Salvage: The capsized cruise liner was brought pulled from the sea bed into its original floating position, shown here in three stages, during the a lengthy 'parbuckling' operation outside Giglio harbour in September.

Righted: Crews have been able to go to work on the crippled cruise ship after the 19-hour operation

Moving in: Overseen by Italian police, divers have now been able to access the part of the seabed where the ship once lay

Determined: Ennio Aquilino, the Search Operations Director for Costa Concordia victims co-ordinates the search and rescue effort

Captain Francesco Schettino, pictured leaving a court in Grosseto earlier this week, is charged with manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship before all aboard were evacuated

Police
and coast guard divers were in the water between 9am and 11am UK time, 
but returned without the remains to inform the prosecutor. They planned 
to return to bring up the body or bodies on Thursday afternoon.

The brother of Indian waiter Rebello said his entire family was praying that he had been found.

He said: ‘I’ve been waiting for a week since they began work on the ship. I’m trying to control myself but I’m very emotional.

‘I’ve
already warned my sister-in-law and my mother and they are praying that
the remains turn out to be those of my brother. It’s important to have a
place to cry and a place to pray.’

Mrs Trecarichi, the last remaining missing passenger, was on the cruise to celebrate 
her 50th birthday with her friend Luisa, her daughter Stefania and her 
daughter’s friend. The two young people survived.

As
the ship sank, Mrs Trecarichi rang her husband, but in a heartbreaking 
twist of fate he failed to answer, having gone to bed early.

She had not got onto a lifeboat with her daughter because she had returned to her cabin to get a warm jacket.

The Sicilian mother-of-one then rang a friend, saying that Stefania was on a boat and she was waiting for the next one.

The phone call was then interrupted by a shout: 'My God my God we are sliding into the water.'

Her grieving husband Elio Vincenzi spoke last week of his hope that he will finally be able to bring his wife home.

He said: ‘I want to bring her home back to Sicily, her homeland. I think only of her.'

The successful parbuckling operation had given him new hope of closure, he said.

Stefania,
18, is now competing in the Miss Italia beauty pageant in her memory of
her mother, who had always encouraged her to enter.

The ship's captain Francesco Schettino is currently on trial accused of manslaughter, causing the 
shipwreck and abandoning ship.
