A fed up father left his entire £2million estate to his two daughters – because his two sons refused to stop smoking.

Businessman Dawid van Vuuren, 87, who had suffered from cancer, warned his sons Daniel, 60, and Marius, 55, that unless they quit the habit they would not get a penny from him.

Marius said: 'My brother had told me what our father said but we thought it was a joke. We didn't take it seriously.'

Two sons have been disinherited for not giving up smoking when their father told them to do so in his will

The two contested the will, saying that their father, from Pretoria, South Africa, had only written it as a warning, but had then died suddenly, leaving it the only signed will in his possession.

The children only discovered the will, which was handwritten on a piece of paper, after their father's death last year. 

At the High Court in Pretoria, Daniel said he and his brother spoke about this prior to their father's death, but they laughed about it as they thought it was funny

He said: 'The truth is my father did admonish me on many occasions during his life that he would disinherit me if I did not stop smoking. 

'I never took his threat seriously and I was shocked when it appeared that he actually carried out his threat.'

The brothers claimed it was then implemented by lawyers against their father's wishes. However, it was ruled by Judge Cynthia Pretorius to be Mr van Vuuren's true will.

Judge Pretorius said it was clear no other testament could be found, except for this paper. Dawid's secretary signed it as a witness, as required by law. 

She had worked for him for 18 years and confirmed his signature was genuine.
