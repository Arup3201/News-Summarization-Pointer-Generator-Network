Sex assault suspect Freddie Starr claims he has lost £1million in earnings as venues cancel his show amid the abuse allegations surrounding him.

Starr, 69, says theatres are 'too scared' to book him after Karin Ward, 52, accused him of trying to grope her in disgraced DJ Jimmy Savile's dressing room in 1974, when she was 14.

The comedian told the Sunday People: 'No one will take me in the theatres because of it. It's ruining my life and my career.'

Ruin: Comedian Freddie Starr and his 34-year-old fiancee Sophie. He says the sex abuse allegations made against him have crippled him financially as bookings dry up

Beautiful setting: The £900,000 house is surrounded by trees and fields in a leafy part of Warwickshire. He is selling it and downsizing with his fiancee.

He was quizzed for two days after he was arrested by detectives earlier this month investigating Jimmy Savile’s decades of paedophilia. He has pledged to prove his innocence.

He told the newspaper he is planning a book about the allegations. He said: 'My life has been turned upside down and I'm up for a fight with anyone at the moment.'

Earlier this week he put his four-bedroom detached mansion up for sale for £900,000.

The luxuriously decorated home is set in the Warwickshire countryside.

Complete with conservatory, games room and bar the home also boasts a detached log cabin in the garden.

It his thought he shares the home with his children and fiancee Sophie Lea.

He reportedly hit rock bottom after he was banned from being left alone with his own children by social services while the abuse claim against him is investigated.

The former television star, 69, was bailed earlier this month and has not been charged with any offence.

Starr had denied meeting his accuser 
but a video later emerged of the pair of them together on Savile’s show 
‘Clunk Click’ in 1974.

Warwickshire
social services has now ordered him to only spend time with his 
children when his fiancee Sophie Lea, 34, is with them at their home.

A council will always act in this way when an individual is subject to sexual assault claims.

Starr was taken into custody at a 
police station near his home earlier on November 1 as part of Operation 
Yewtree - Scotland Yard's inquiry into alleged child sexual exploitation
by the late Jim'll Fix It presenter and others.

He
voluntarily returned to speak to officers for further questioning the 
next day following his release on bail in the early hours of the 
morning.

Starr was then released for the second time on November 2 with officers saying he had been 're-bailed to a date in December'.

Luxuriously refurbished: The home is decked out with a bar and lounge area overlooking the lush garden

Spacious: The home offers a comfortable living area - with room for large group to watch television together

Decadent: Drapes are hung over the large guest bed and a chandelier takes centre place

Every comfort: The mansion boasts four bedrooms, each uniquely decorated with their own colour schemes

Regal colours: The bedrooms each have views of trees and nature and have ample storage space

Perfect for a little princess: The fourth bedroom is decorated in pink and white

Unique feature: To the back of the house is a log cabin with three rooms and attic space

On
the same day officers raided his home, seizing his computer, hard 
drive, his old address books, old photographs and his iPhone, he says.

Earlier this month, Starr cancelled a show to concentrate on defending the sex abuse allegations.

Fans were expecting to see the comedian perform his Back From The Jungle Tour at the Wyvern Theatre in Swindon, Wiltshire.

But Wyvern Theatre director Derek Aldridge said the show would not go on, following discussions with Starr and his team.

He
said: 'Following the weekend, we have held further discussions with 
Freddie Starr and his management team and have agreed that the show will
no longer take place at the Wyvern Theatre on Wednesday, November 7.’

Idyllic: The house is set amid trees and fields in Warwickshire

English country garden: The house back out on to fields and has a decked area for admiring the view

Spacious: The kitchen has enough space for three people to sit and eat - without getting in the way of the cook

Neutral tones: The master bedroom has an ensuite shower room decorated in granite tiles

Fully refurbished: The second bathroom is fitted with a free-standing bath and red carpet

Leafy terrace: The home has an outdoor area with heaters perfect for eating outside in the evening

Difficult time: Freddie Starr has spoken of his anger at being dragged into the Jimmy Savile scandal after he was arrested
