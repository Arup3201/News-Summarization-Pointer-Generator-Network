Swiss Super League side Sion have been attempting a rather unorthodox way of placating travelling fans - by offering them free tickets and local delicacies before games.

Last Sunday, around 600 supporters of away side Luzern were treated to white wine and grilled cheese with pickles from the Valais region in Switzerland where Sion are based. 

And it must have worked in some way as the home side went on to win 3-1, their third victory in five home games.

In July, Sion sent out the following press release: 'Valais has a reputation for acceptance and friendliness. We want to honour this image and make a step in your direction, in the spirit of sport and fair play.

'The move is the idea of club owner and president Christian Constantin, who has become somewhat infamous for his regular disposal of managers - sacking 28 of them during his 10-year reign at the club so far. 

But, despite the show of good nature, he also added a layer of threat to away fans at the end of the  press release, saying: 'And if it doesn’t work out, then I’ll close the away stand after the winter break.'

Some Luzern fans, however, were clearly not won over by the idea, setting off flares in the away section of the Tourbillon stadium.

But in a home game in August, fans of Basel went even further, when about 1,000 of them chipped in 10 Swiss Francs each per head - approximately the same cost of a ticket - and gave the collection back to Constantin with the message: 'Mir löhn uns nid kaufe', translating as: 'We won’t allow ourselves to be bought.'
