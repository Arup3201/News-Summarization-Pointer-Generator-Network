A Christian school teacher who was caught semi-naked in his car with a 14-year-old student  has admitted to having sex with her multiple times and sending her explicit photos and videos.

Eric Beasley, 25, a former biology teacher at Zion Lutheran Christian School in Deerfield Beach, Florida could serve 20 years in federal prison under the plea deal with prosecutors, his lawyers said.

He pleaded guilty on Monday to a federal charge of persuading or enticing the girl to have sex with him and he plans to plead guilty this week to sexual battery, his lawyers told the Sun Sentinel.

Beasley, who reportedly had a girlfriend at the time, was arrested on April 1 after police responded to reports of a suspicious vehicle behind a strip mall and found him inside the car with the young girl.

Beasley scrambled to get his clothes on, while the girl was naked from below the waist, the officers noted in their report. It was still daylight at the time and the window was partially blocked with clothes.

The girl initially claimed that she was 19 and that they were consenting adults who had met online but she later confessed to being in his ninth-grade biology class at the $11,000-a-year school.

Beasley admitted to authorities that he had sex multiple times with the girl since Valentine's Day.

He told officers that on three occasions that he engaged in inappropriate behavior during school hours, including kissing during the victim's lunch breaks, according to a police report.

The pair also texted each other naked photographs, while Beasley sent the teenager a video of him masturbating, authorities discovered.

'I miss you,' he wrote in one text. 'But we have to remain cautious and vigilant. Every meeting is a risk. l won't let that stop me from seeing you altogether, but we should be cautious about how many risks we take.'

In another message, he added: 'I want to feel you. lnside and out. Not want. Need. l require physical intimacy with you. Kissing you feels as essential as breathing.' 

He was initially freed on $92,000 bond but a judge later ruled he should stay behind bars, saying that he could be a danger to the community.  

The school, where he was just a second-year teacher, suspended Beasley immediately after he was arrested.

He had previously been warned by staff not to spend time alone with the girl after a student and a parent reported their concern over the pair's relationship in December 2013. 

Administrators said the school had obtained state and federal law enforcement background checks on Beasley before hiring him, as it does before all new hires work with students.

Fired: He was suspended from his job at the Zion Lutheran Christian School following his arrest

His lawyers say he had sincere feelings for the girl and still cares about her, the Sentinel reported.  

Prosecutors and the girl's parents will recommend that he is sentenced to 20 years behind bars, his lawyer said, but he could also be placed on supervised release for the rest of his life. He will also have to register as a sex offender.

The girl's parents have also filed a civil lawsuit against Beasley, the school, church and Evangelical Lutheran church organizations and officials.
