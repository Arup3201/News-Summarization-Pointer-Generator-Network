It is often said by sports fans that they would move heaven and earth to ensure victory for their team.

But on Saturday the earth literally moved for fans of the Seattle Seahawks as they celebrated a fourth quarter touchdown by Marshawn Lynch in the playoffs against the New Orleans Saints.

Three seismographs set up around the CenturyLink Field stadium measured tremors which scientist think could be equivalent to a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake.

Earthquake: Fans of the Seattle Seahawks managed to cause a magnitude 1 or 2 earthquake while celebrating a fourth quarter Marshawn Lynch touchdown

Star player: Lynch ran in two touchdowns during the playoff game against the New Orleans Saints but it was his second 32-yard score which nearly brought the house down

Experts from The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network say the shaking could have been greater than the famous Beast Quake in 2011 which happened after another Lynch touchdown, but they will not know for sure for a few days.

On that occasion a seismograph placed a block away from the stadium picked up the impact after Lynch ran in a 67-yard score, also against the Saints.

Lynch's touchdown yesterday sealed a 23-15 win for the top-seeded Seahawks which puts them through to the NFL championship game for only the second time in the franchise's history.

Running back Lynch also scored in the first half with a 15-yard touchdown, running a total of 140 yards during the game, while Steven Hauschka kicked three field goals.

Scientists from The Pacific Northwest Seismic Network measured the crowd tremor on three seismographs around the stadium and tweeted the results

The researchers tweeted the results and later added that the shake could have been larger than the famous Beast Quake of 2011, which was also caused by Seahawks fans after another Lynch touchdown, also against the Saints

The Saints scored two fourth quarter touchdowns, including this one by Khiry Robinson, but it was too little to late to save them from defeat

While the Seahawks offence ran riot, their defence was equally impressive, keeping the Saints off of the scoreboard until the fourth quarter.

New Orleans flourished late, with two fourth quarter touchdowns, but it was too little too late.

The Seahawks will be looking to bring the noise again this Sunday against the san Fransisco 49ers, who beat the Carolina Panthers 23-10.

Four sacks on Panthers quarterback cam Newtown and two one-yard stops ensured a trip to Seattle for the 49ers who are hoping for a return trip to the Superbowl where they were beaten by the Baltimore Ravens last year by just three points.
