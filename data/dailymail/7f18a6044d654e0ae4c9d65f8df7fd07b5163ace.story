A driver has been arrested after a 70-year-old man collapsed and died - during a fight over a car parking space.

The victim, who has not named, was rushed to hospital after keeling over, after suffering a suspected heart attack, in the Tyseley Community Centre car park in Birmingham just before 2pm yesterday.

The centre is near a children's play are where his grandchildren were playing at the time.

A 44-year-old man from the Billesley area of the city was arrested at the scene in connection with the death, West Midlands Police said.

Officers attending to the dying grandfather tried to resuscitate him at the scene, but in vain.

West Midlands Police Detective Inspector Warren Hines said: 'We understand there was a verbal altercation in the car park - it’s not yet clear what sparked the argument or whether there was any physical contact between the men.

'One of the drivers, a man believed to be in his seventies, collapsed at the scene and sadly was pronounced dead later in hospital.

'I’m keen to speak to anyone who was in the park at the time or around Tyseley Community Centre and may have heard the argument or witnessed what prompted it.'

The area was busy at the time of the row, as worshippers were arriving to attend afternoon prayers at the mosque.

Police came to collect CCTV footage of the scene earlier today as they continue to try and piece together exactly what happened.

Anyone who witnessed the incident in the car park in Formans Road is asked to contact West Midlands Police on 101.

The altercation happened in the community centre’s car park, next to Reddings Lane children’s play area, although the building manager said there had been no activities on the day.

Manager Ellen Foche, who has worked at the community centre for more than 20 years, said the man’s death was 'a tragedy'.

She said the car park, which is covered by at least two CCTV cameras, was used 'by a lot of the community' because of its location next to the park, the local mosque, a school and the centre.

Amjad Ahmed, principal of Al-Furqan Community College opposite the car park, said he heard an elderly Asian man had been involved in a row.

He added that evening prayers were said for the man at the nearby Mahmudsabir Masjid mosque, where Mr Ahmed is also a trustee, on Sunday.

'I heard that an elderly gentleman was in an argument with a taxi driver and he fell and the next thing, police were called and an ambulance was sent,' he said.

'One of the school workmen said police were trying to resuscitate him, but sadly we heard later he had passed away. It’s tragic, and I also understand his grandchildren were playing in the park at the time as well.'
