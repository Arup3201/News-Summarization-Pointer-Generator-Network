A Massachusetts state senator is hoping to keep sex offenders from winning huge sums in the lottery they can then use to pay off their victims after a serial child predator took home $10 million.

'Should someone on the sex offender list purchase a ticker and win, I think we should find a way from preventing them from enjoying the proceeds,' state Sen. Richard Moore told the Boston Herald.

'This doesn't smell right to start with....There’s a lot of questions we need to resolve, but I think we can do it fairly quickly.'

Snay, a Level 3 sex offender who won a $10 million state lottery prize in 2008, has been arrested on charges that he sexually abused a boy for several years and showed him pornography

Moore's concerns came after a Level 3
 sex offender who won a $10 million state lottery prize in 2008 has been
 arrested on charges that he sexually abused a boy for several years and
 showed him pornography.

Daniel
 Snay, 62, of Uxbridge, Mass., was arrested on Friday and charged with 
indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of 14 – a 
subsequent offense, reckless endangerment of a child, enticement of a 
child and dissemination of pornography to a minor, police said.

Uxbridge
 police are working with police in Connecticut and Rhode Island as some 
of the alleged offenses occurred in those states.

Uxbridge police Chief Jeffrey A. Lourie said he was in favor of a change.

'Having access to large sums of money gives individuals an ability to do good, and in this case, to do bad,' he said.

In 2008, Snay bought a $20 scratch ticket 
at a Cumberland Farms in Hopedale and won $10 million.

Police believe he used his lottery windfall to groom and gain favor with people.

'Snay
 was the recipient of a $10 million dollar lottery award and that 
windfall aided the commission of the crimes,' said Chief Jeffrey 
Lourie. 

He is being held at the police station without bail and will be taken to Uxbridge District Court on Monday for arraignment.

The alleged crimes occurred over a four-year period, reports Telegram.com.

Police
 said they had been receiving reports from concerned residents that Snay
 was in close contact with young children, but it wasn't until recently 
that someone came forward, Chief Lourie said.

Snay was convicted six times of indecent assault and battery in the 1970s and 1980s.

In 1974 he received a one-year suspended sentence for indecent assault and battery on a child under 14. He violated probation and was sent to jail for a year.

Then two years later in 1976, Snay was sentenced to serve five to seven years in state prison after he was convicted of indecent assault and battery on a child under 14.
