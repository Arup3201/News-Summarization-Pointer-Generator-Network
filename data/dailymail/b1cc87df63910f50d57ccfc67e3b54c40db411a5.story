Attack: Millionaire Lord Fink said that cutting tax relief for donations would discourage people from giving

The Conservative party treasurer turned on George Osborne today in a growing revolt over plans to cut relief on charitable donations.

Millionaire Lord Fink, one of the country's most generous supporters of good causes, said the plans would inevitable reduce the value of donations.

The tax relief cap, set at 25 per cent of a donor’s income if he or she is giving more than £50,000, is due to come into effect next April.

Lord Fink told the Sunday Times: 'If you have to pay out of your capital the tax on your income you give, it will put people off.'

As the backlash continued against the policy, announced by Chancellor George Osborne in last month's budget, a group of leading benefactors also warned it would act as 'a brake on philanthropy'.

Senior Conservative backbencher Zac Goldsmith said he was 'ashamed' that his party appeared to have 'declared war' on the very people who should be at the heart of the Government's Big Society project.

Someone earning £1million will be able to donate £250,000 to charities without paying tax on it.

However, any further income given above that threshold will be taxed - reducing the amount good causes receive.

Defending the scheme, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was 'not right' that some super-rich individuals were able to exploit the reliefs to cut their income tax bills 'to almost nothing'.

'There's been a lot of controversy about plans to cap charity tax relief. But it is not right that some wealthy individuals can use them without limit to reduce tax bills to close to zero,' he told the Sunday People.

'Tax without friends': George Osborne is under growing pressure to perform a U-turn over plans to cut tax relief on charitable donations

Amid reports that the Treasury was considering alternatives to the £50,000 cap, a spokeswoman said it was in talks with philanthropists to find ways to limit the impact on charities that rely on big donations.

'We support charitable giving and the vast majority of donations will be completely unaffected,' she said.

Ed Miliband has said he would be happy to publish his tax return, adding he felt that enhanced transparency was 'inevitable'.

But he said limits should be agreed to stop details emerging such as medical records or spouses revealing their tax details.

David Cameron and George Osborne have said they are happy to publish their details and would consider making it a requirement for people seeking high office.

Mr Miliband said today: 'I'm perfectly happy (to publish). I sort of think it is kind of inevitable it is going to come.

'I challenged David Cameron and George Osborne on the day of the Budget, I said to them do you benefit from the 50p tax cut? I thought a lot about this, whether it was fair to do it.

'The reason I did it was if you're coming along with a Budget which raises taxes on pensioners, raises taxes on working families, raises taxes effectively on charities, if you're personally getting a benefit only a few people are getting, I think it is a fair enough, legitimate question.

'I didn't call for the tax return to be published, but if that's the way things are going I'm perfectly happy to do it.'

Critics have questioned why the tax system, rather than a charity sector watchdog, is being used to tackle what the Government says is a problem with bogus charities being used as vehicles by a small number of individuals.

Senior Tory MP David Davis told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show it was a 'tax without friends' and said he expected the cap to be dropped and replaced with an alternative method to tackle the issue.

The Sunday Telegraph said the main option under consideration was a US-style 'lifetime legacies' system that allowed individuals to 'donate' assets to institutions and charities but continue to benefit from their assets during their lifetime.

In a letter to the paper, 46 wealthy donors including members of the Sainsbury family, urged a rethink.

'The proposal in the Budget to cap charity tax reliefs is a brake on philanthropy that may deter future donors.

'It is confusing and dispiriting, and we urge the Prime Minister and chancellor to think again,' they wrote.

'None of us view tax relief as a primary motive, although it may substantially increase our donations.

'But
it is an important signal that the decision to use wealth to help 
others, rather than to enrich ourselves, is recognised, encouraged and 
supported by society.'

Prime
Minister David Cameron said last week that he would listen 'very 
sympathetically' to charities concerned that philanthropic giving will 
decline as a result of the change.

Mr
Goldsmith said: 'I am ashamed that a Conservative Chancellor has not 
only announced measures that will undoubtedly depress giving in this 
country; he has spun a narrative in which philanthropists are now the 
enemy.

'His intention to cap tax relief on donations to charity could well prove to be this Government's single costliest mistake.'

Former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy 
Ashdown said there was a problem with the very rich selecting charities 
to fund in lieu of paying tax for public services.

He
told the BBC Andrew Marr programme: 'There is a problem here but it is 
simply not open to the kind of simplistic solution that Labour grabs 
hold of for opportunistic reasons.

Dropped: David Davis MP, pictured on the BBC's Andrew Marr show today, said he expects plans for the charities tax relief cap to be axed

'I'm president of UNICEF UK, I know exactly how this hits big and small charities.

'But
there is a problem. What is the Government trying to do? It's trying to
make sure the rich pay their taxes and don't dodge them.

'Just
imagine everybody did this, that everybody said I'm not going to pay my
taxes, I'm going to donate to a charity of my choice.

'No taxes - no hospitals, no schools,
no welfare. There is a sensible balance to be struck here. If the 
Government has to recalibrate, retreat if you like, to find that balance
that is right and proper they should do so.'

Shadow
chief secretary Rachel Reeves said: 'The Government have talked about 
some people giving money to dodgy charities. If that's happening then 
the Charities Commission need to investigate.

'We've got our major charities, universities, and arts organisations in this country saying it is going to cost them.

'Yes we want to make sure people are paying their fair share of tax but the people who seem to be losing out from this change aren't tax avoiders - it's the charities and people who rely on the charities.'

Senior Liberal Democrat Sir Menzies Campbell told the Sky News Murnaghan programme he had written to George Osborne about the impact on charities in his capacity as Chancellor of St Andrew's University.

He said: 'The proposals the Chancellor has made could easily hit the kind of targets we need to seek out ourselves in order to persuade people, such as former graduates, to make generous donations.

'The Government is obviously accepting it has got to go back and look at this again.

'Very rich people should pay their fair share of tax and that is why the tax regime, and it's been Liberal Democrat policy, to take the poorest people out of tax altogether. Everyone should pay what they are assessed to pay.'
