Chelsea fans might doubt whether Fernando Torres will have much of an impact on the coming World Cup. But the Spain centre-forward has made a habit over recent years - at international level at least - of proving his critics wrong.

When Atletico Madrid’s Diego Costa was declared fit to make the final 23 man squad it seemed likely that Torres, who is also now set to be replaced by Costa at club level, would miss out on Brazil.

The now 30 year old was however included – and now travels to try and win his fourth consecutive international tournament.

That is quite some record - especially considering that for many supporters in England Torres has long been a busted flush. Serious thigh and knee injuries meant he was already on the decline at Liverpool before his move to Chelsea in January 2010. Since then eight Blues managers have tried - and failed - to spark a return to the form which persuaded Roman Abramovich to pay the huge 50 million fee.

Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque has been more patient than most but even he had lost faith by February 2012. Torres - who had gone 20 Chelsea games without a goal - was then dropped for Spain’s final friendly before the squad was named for that summer’s European Championship finals in Poland and Ukraine.

A few months later the situation had changed again. Del Bosque’s first choice David Villa had not recovered from a broken leg. Torres had also scored at Barcelona’s Camp Nou on the way to winning that season’s Champions League.

So ‘El Niño’ went to Poland and Ukraine, 
where he started just two games. But still scored four times and ended 
the tournament with both another winners’ medal and the ‘golden boot’.

This time around the story looks pretty similar. Torres has not had a good campaign at club level, with current Stamford Bridge boss Jose Mourinho clearly not a fan.

And the now 30 year old was not picked in any international squad during the 2013/14 season, with Costa, Fernando Llorente, Alvaro Negredo and last summer’s big Tottenham signing Roberto Soldado all rated better by Del Bosque.

That was until fate again intervened - Costa was hamstrung, Negredo and Soldado woefully off-form, and Llorente not seen as a fit with Spain’s tiki-taka style.

So Torres returned for last Friday’s warm-up friendly against Bolivia in Seville, where he snatched at a number of presentable goal chances, but also converted a penalty to move to 37 goals in 107 international caps. The following morning he was confirmed in Spain’s squad for the tournament.

It still seems most likely that Cesc Fabregas will be Spain’s central attacker for their opener against Holland in Curitiba on June 13.

Costa looks first choice should Del Bosque opt for a traditional number nine later in the tournament. But given past experience nobody should bet against Torres making another mark at some point over the next six weeks.
