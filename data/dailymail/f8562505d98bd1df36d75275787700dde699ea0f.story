If you have always wanted to swim with fish in a colourful reef, but lack the time or money for an exotic holiday, a new virtual reality headset could be for you.

Swimmers will soon be able to wear the snorkel-meets-headset to feel as if they are diving in Caribbean or Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, when they are only floating in their local swimming pool.

Called the Nautilus VR, the waterproof device is designed to work with a smartphone and has a built-in snorkel for an immersive experience so swimmers don't have to think about breathing underwater.

Swimmers can wear a snorkel-meets-VR headset to feel as if they are diving in Caribbean or Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, when they are only floating in their local swimming pool

It will allow wearers to swim alongside a blue whale or 100-year-old turtle as well as look at virtual coral and even encounter icebergs or sharks.

The waterproof 'mask' fits over a person's face and has two eye holes to let them see the screen. 

The head mounted display has a slot for a smartphone, which provides the visual trickery, in a similar way to Google’s Cardboard or Samsung’s Gear VR.

It relies on the Nautilus Platform app so users can choose different scenes.

The headset relies on the Nautilus Platform app so users can choose different scenes, including island Isla Mujeres in Mexico, the Great Barrier Reef, lost city of Atlantis or icebergs. An example is shown

Materials: hypoallergenic silicone, polycarbonate and polypropylene

Case: Waterproof with certificate IP67

Compatibility: Works with smartphones with screen of 4.7inches to 5.2inches

Features: Natural breathing system and anti-fog crystal lenses

Price: Earlybird price of $69 (£47) via Kickstarter.

‘You will access a fascinating underwater experience with interactive virtual environments and high quality 360 degree videos in an open and collaborative platform,’ the company said.

Discover the island Isla Mujeres in Mexico, immerse yourself in the Great Barrier Reef, explore the lost city of Atlantis or dive like never before under giant icebergs.’

While some may worry that using the immersive device in water could be dangerous, the firm shows it being used in a controlled environment like a swimming pool. 

Remotte, the Californian company behind the device is raising money on Kickstarter to put it into production.

It claims that the device is compatible with ‘most’ smartphones, including the iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S5 and Sony Xperia Z3. 

The app will run on iOs, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Oculus devices and will be compatible with Google Cardboard, meaning it doesn't have to be used by swimmers wearing the headset

The firm’s founders were inspired to create the device having experienced the Oculus Rift and wanted to ‘bring the mysteries of underwater worlds to children’ in a bid to teach them to love and respect the environment.

‘They will be able to find detailed information on species and their natural habitat.

‘The platform is available in a special version that can be adapted to tablets, allowing the whole family to find complete information on marine life,’ they added, meaning that the headset doesn’t always have to be used in water.

The app will run on iOs, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry and Oculus devices and will be compatible with Google Cardboard.

‘Naturally you will not have the same sensations as if you were underwater, but you will be able to enjoy the amazing underwater world unfolding before your eyes,’ the firm said.

The Nautilus VR Platfrom is designed to be open and it’s hoped that artists and developers will use it to create their own underwater worlds.

The headset, with access to the app, can be pre-ordered on Kickstarter for $69 (£47) with estimated delivery in December.

A motorbike brand in Minnesota is offering a virtual reality sit-and-ride experience.

Victory Motorcycles is allowing motorcycle enthusiasts to sit on a bike and go for a ride, by wearing an Oculus Rift headset, Mashable reported.

Riders go on a simulated journey through the Badlands on Needle Highway - a famous stretch of road cutting though the desert in South Dakota.

They sit on a real bike and can use the control as if they were on a real journey, as well as lean from side to side. 

There is even a 'tactile transducer; to recreate the vibrations of a bike.

The experience, created by digital agency space150, is designed to attract visitors at trade shows and make a model feel more appealing 

'If you sit for a ride, you’re more likely to own one of our motorcycles, according to internal studies,' said Lisa Grimm, director of public relations and emerging media at the agency.

'So we wanted to use technology to create something immersive and solve a business challenge.'
