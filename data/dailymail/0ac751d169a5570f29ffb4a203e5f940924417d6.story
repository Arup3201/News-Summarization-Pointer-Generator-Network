Attacked: Anthony Power, 78, died from the injuries he sustained

A successful businessman was punched and kicked to death in a park by a man who took the keys to his Bentley, prosecutors have told a jury.

Anthony Power, 78, was found covered in blood and with several fractures after the vicious attack in October last year.

He never recovered from his injuries, which included 'catastrophic' brain damage and died in hospital two weeks later.

Suspect Imran Khan, 30, was found sitting in the driver's seat of Mr Power's luxury car after attacking the pensioner, Sheffield Crown Court heard.

Khan went on trial today accused of murdering Mr Power - the founder of the international lingerie firm, Panache.

The 78-year-old businessman was found seriously injured in High Hazels Park, in the Darnall area of Sheffield, on October 8 last year.

The attacker had taken the keys to his car, his iPhone and cash after beating and kicking him in the face and chest.

He was attacked near his £180,000 Bentley Continental after arriving in the park to look for his elderly brother.

His brother Thomas, known to his family as Noel, suffers from dementia and had left his nearby house.

After Noel had been located safely, members of the family then went looking for Mr Power, who had not returned.

Simon Waley, prosecuting said: ‘Officers attended and at 9pm found Anthony lying on the grass near the footpath in the park.

‘His head was covered in blood and his face was already beginning to swell up.

‘He was conscious but could not speak or communicate in any way.’

Mr Power had suffered bleeding and bruising to his brain resulting in ‘catastrophic brain damage’.

He had fractured ribs, multiple fractures to his face - especially his eye socket and nose - and lacerations to his face and head.

He was put on a ventilator but this was turned off on October 26 last year, and he died, the jury heard.

Khan, of Darnall, Sheffield, has denied murdering Mr Power and assaulting two other people on the same night.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
