Prospective buyers will have to kiss goodbye to £1.5million in order to buy the historic home of Admiral Lord Nelson’s captain Thomas Hardy that has come up for sale.

Portesham House was home to Vice-Admiral Hardy up until 1807, two years after he had sat at Nelson’s deathbed during the Battle of Trafalgar.

As the naval hero lay dying after being fatally shot, he is said to have famously uttered the words ‘Kiss me, Hardy,’ to his long-time friend.

On the market: The historic home of Admiral Lord Nelson's captain, Thomas Hardy, is on sale for £1.5million

The Grade II listed, 500-year-old house is set in 1.2 acres of land in the quaint Dorset village of Portesham, where Hardy’s family owned an estate.

The village is overlooked by a 65ft monument of Hardy, one of Dorset’s most famous sons, alongside legendary author Thomas Hardy, who was no relation.

The plush house boasts seven bedrooms, four reception rooms, two bathrooms and a grand Roman pillared front door.

It also features a stunning walled garden with mill stream and ornamental canal, and a separate coach house and stables.

Peter Lane, from estate agents Savills which is now selling the property, said: 'This property is a quintessential Georgian village house and a little slice of British history.

'It is one of the most historically important houses in Dorset. It is thought to be of Tudor origin and was remodelled in the Georgian period.

'It features many original features including a fine reception hall and staircase, several fireplaces.

'The house has also undergone comprehensive and sympathetic improvements which include the addition of a utility room, a store room and a magnificent kitchen and breakfast room providing access to, and extensive views of, the gardens.

'It is a very special house indeed.'

Nelson was killed by a bullet from a musket but Hardy survived, returning to Britain with his friend’s body.

Although Hardy moved out of Portesham House in 1807 following his marriage to Lady Louisa Berkeley, the house remained in his family until the 1930s when the Portesham estate was broken up.

Hardy went on to become First Naval Lord in 1830 and was offered the chance to become an MP but refused.

He died in Greenwich, London, in 1839.
