Eman Abdou is the head of an organisation which has been accused of sending funds to terror group Islamic State

A registered not-for-profit group is denying it has ties to an extremist group in the Middle East, despite its members' association with Islamic State militants.

Mothers and Children Fundraiser for Syria has been accused of sending its funds to the Middle East to aid the activities of the al-Qaeda off-shoot.

The group is registered with Consumer Affairs Victoria and among its membership is Susan Dahman - the sister of a Northcote suicide bomber - and a sister-in-law of another Australian on the frontlines in the Middle East serving under the Islamic State flag, according to the Herald Sun.

It is believed 18-year-old Adam Dahman, from Melbourne's inner city suburb of Northcote, was one of the people who killed five others at a market in Iraq in July by strapping explosives to his body.

The Melbourne-based charity group aims to raise funds for medical equipment, educational supplies, food and water through fundraising auctions and dinners.

The woman who heads the group, Eman Abdou, told the Herald Sun she was not able to reveal which organisations the money was benefiting.

But on social media she said the money was being put to good use the children who were left disadvantaged by the conflict.

Ms Abdou said as a mother herself she felt something needed to be done to help them.

'I woke up and decided enough is enough and I am going to do what little I can to help these children,' she wrote on Facebook.

'I have helped in a few charity events that have opened orphanages in Syria, I am also a proud sponsor of a syrian (sic) orphan.

She said as a mother she felt compelled to help children displaced by the conflict and had helped open orphanages in Syria

'My children and I went to Palestinian rallies and raised our voices for the innocent people in Gaza, raised funds for medical supplies to help the doctors cope.

'Have I done enough I haven't, but im (sic) trying we are all humanitarians and human rights activsts.

'We all care, we all weep, we all pray for peace, we all try to help.

'After all we are humans, our hearts beat the same regardless of skin colour or religion.

'I will continue to support the innocent people in Syria and Palestine and everywhere that humanitarian aid is needed.'

The National Security Legislation Monitor believes more than $20 million received by terrorist groups fighting in the Middle East in 2012-13 came from Australian shores, the Herald Sun reported.
