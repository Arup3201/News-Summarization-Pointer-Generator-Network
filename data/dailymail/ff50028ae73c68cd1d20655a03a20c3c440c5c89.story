Marnick Vermijl, Reece James, Saido Janko. Not names you would familiarise with playing for Manchester United. In fact, Louis van Gaal's stance of playing the youngsters against MK Dons on Tuesday night will warrant him a piece of unwanted history.

For United can only play a maximum of 46 games this season after being dumped out of the Capital One Cup, which will be their lowest in at least 27 years.

Van Gaal inherited a team that was out of Europe and could only focus on domestic competitions, so it was somewhat bewildering that the Dutch boss elected to rest several first-teamers when travelling to Stadium mk. Especially when he is still trying to implement his 3-5-2 formation.

Right move? Louis van Gaal played the youngsters against MK Dons and subsequently lost 4-0

Battle: Marnick Vermijl struggled to come to terms with the physical nature in the Capital One Cup

Dejection: United will play a maximum of 46 games this season, their lowest in at least 20 years

Including all FA Cup replays and Community Shield

Manchester United 46

Chelsea 65

Manchester City 66

Everton 67 

Arsenal 68

Tottenham 69

Hull 71

United's possible fixtures lists are dwarfed by their Premier League rivals. Manchester City may play 66, including the Charity Shield, Chelsea and Liverpool could take to the pitch 65 times. Everton 67, Arsenal 68, Tottenham 69, even Hull City could reach the 71 game mark should they make all their finals.

The figures gathered take into account every game, including replays, a team could face in the 2014/15 season. Now, United can only look forward to the league and the FA Cup. This is not what they're used to.

The Red Devils have not dipped below playing 50 games a season since the 1995/96 campaign, while the last time they played 46 games was in '81/82. You have to go as far back as 1958/59 to find what United's realistic total could be this year, 43.

No stopping us: Chelsea and Manchester City should play over 60 games this season

Over the last 10 years, United's lowest season total was 53 in 2011/12, while they managed 66 in '08/09. That season included a Champions League and Capital One Cup final, a Club World Cup, and an FA Cup semi. How times have changed.

There could be the argument that Van Gaal's side could flourish playing less games while their so-called rivals are on their European venture in the week. United won't even play a midweek fixture until December.

But should their strength in depth be so weak? The likes of Angel di Maria and Marcos Rojo will certainly improve things at Old Trafford with their ability to operate in different positions, but against MK Dons, these were the man backing up the first team.

Fresh legs: United only played 46 games in the 1987/88 season, including all fixtures

History: You have to go as far back as '58/59 to the last time United played this season's realistic total

Experienced: But several of Van Gaal's go-to men on Tuesday night failed to deliver at Stadium mk

Danny Welbeck, Javier Hernandez, Shinji Kagawa and Adnan Januzaj all went to the World Cup in the summer. None of them could trouble David Martin in the hosts' goal. Meanwhile, City and Chelsea in particular can rely on a star-studded bench in a trusted system to ease past lowly position.

Van Gaal has made his mind up that the Premier League and the FA Cup is the way to go this season. Time will tell whether this courageous decision at such a huge club will be vindicated.
