A woman has been charged with the assault of an 80-year-old Sikh man in an attack filmed on a mobile phone.

Police arrested 19-year-old Coral Millerchip on Friday, after the elderly man was punched in the face and shoved to the ground in Coventry city centre in broad daylight last Saturday.

Millerchip, from the Wyken area of the West Midlands city, has been charged with one count of assault and has been remanded in custody.

The man, 80, was punched in the face and shoved to the ground in broad daylight in Trinity Street in Coventry city centre last Saturday

A police statement said: 'Millerchip was arrested from an address outside of the West Midlands yesterday after police received reports that an 80-year-old man had been attacked in the city centre last Saturday.'

The 19-year-old was arrested on Friday after police traced her to an address in Gloucester.

She was taken to a West Midlands Police station where she was questioned about the attack.

The elderly victim was punched in the face and shoved to the ground leaving him with a bloodied nose and black eye.

A video of the assault, recorded by a 
passer-by on their mobile phone, was widely circulated on social media.

The attack happened at around 8.30pm next to a city centre supermarket.

Police are still keen to hear from people who witnessed the incident and moments leading up to the attack and have urged anyone who shared the video or still images of the assault to remove them from social media accounts as they could hinder the inquiry.

Anyone with information should contact West Midlands Police on the 101 number or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555111.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
