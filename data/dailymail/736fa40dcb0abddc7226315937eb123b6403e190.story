Controversy: Mark Kelly filling out paperwork at a gun shop before buying an assault rifle

Gabby Giffords' husband has had his purchase of an assault rifle cancelled after the gun shop where he bought it concluded that he only wanted the weapon as a political stunt.

Mark Kelly, a leading advocate for gun control since his wife was wounded in the Tucson shooting which left six dead two years ago, bought the AR-15-style rifle three weeks ago to show how easy it is to acquire lethal weapons.

Yesterday the owner of Diamondback Police Supply, in Tucson, announced that he had returned Mr Kelly's money because he was not buying the gun 'for his personal use'.

Doug MacKinlay said that he plans to raffle off the gun to raise funds for law enforcement, and donate the value of the rifle to a firearms safety organisation.

Mr Kelly was accused of hypocrisy for buying the same gun he is lobbying to ban, but he insisted that he was only doing so to make a point and said he would hand the weapon in to police.

Because the rifle was second hand, the former astronaut had to wait 20 days to take possession of it - and during that period Mr MacKinlay decided to cancel the deal.

'While I support and respect Mark Kelly’s 2nd Amendment rights to purchase, possess, and use firearms in a safe and responsible manner, his recent statements to the media made it clear that his intent in purchasing the Sig Sauer M400 5.56mm rifle from us was for reasons other then for his personal use,' the store owner said in a statement.

'In light of this fact, I determined that it was in my company’s best interest to terminate this transaction prior to his returning to my store to complete the Federal Form 4473 and NICS background check required of Mr Kelly before he could take possession this firearm.

'A full refund was sent to Mr Kelly, via express mail, on Thursday of last week.'

He added that the gun would be given 
to the Arizona Tactical Officers Association, who will raffle it off to 
buy equipment for the state's SWAT teams.

Mr MacKinlay's business will also 
donate $1,295, the price of the rifle, to the Eddie Eagle GunSafe 
Program, which teaches schoolchildren what to do if they come across a 
weapon.

Earlier this month, Mr Kelly posted a
photo on Facebook of him filling out paperwork at the gun shop, along 
with a statement setting out his reasons for buying the rifle.

He
said that the background check for the purchases took only a matter of 
minutes to complete, and added that he dreaded to think people can buy 
similar guns without background checks at gun shows or on the Internet.

The
AR-15 is among 157 military-style weapons that would be banned under a 
bill pending before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.

Mr
Kelly and Ms Giffords started the Americans for Responsible Solutions 
gun control group amid the wave of mass shootings in recent months and 
have been touring the country in recent months in support of expanded 
background checks for gun purchases.

Ms Giffords, then a U.S. 
Representative, was among 13 people wounded in a January 2011 shooting 
as she met with constituents outside a Tucson supermarket. Six were 
killed.

She resigned from Congress last year as she continues to recover from her injuries.

Mr MacKinlay earlier said Mr Kelly never revealed 
to the store's staff why he was buying the guns and added that it would 
be wrong to refuse to sell a gun to someone because of their personal 
views.

'He is a U.S. citizen, an Arizona 
citizen and expressing his Second Amendment right to purchase and own a 
firearm,' Mr MacKinlay said.

Todd Rathner, a lobbyist for the 
National Rifle Association's affiliate in Arizona and a national NRA 
board member, questioned the point that Mr Kelly was trying to make in 
buying the guns, saying a model citizen like him should be able to 
buy a gun relatively quickly.

He also noted that such a purchase could have been a good investment as the value of those types of weapon soars amid heightened demand from gun owners.

'If you believe him, it's a cheap publicity stunt,' Mr Rathner said. 'If you don't, then he was speculating on the value of the rifle because he knew the prices would be inflated.'

Mr Kelly told CNN that it was important for him to have firsthand information on the ease of buying guns such as the AR-15 and that he looks forward to buying a firearm at a gun show in the future.

The high-profile couple have long been supporters of gun rights and owned handguns themselves.
