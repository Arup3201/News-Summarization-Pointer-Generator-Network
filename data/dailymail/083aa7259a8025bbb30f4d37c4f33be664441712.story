A pregnant police officer from Florence, Kentucky, has been told she has to stay on patrol during her pregnancy - or take unpaid leave and lose her health benefits.

Lyndi Trischler, who became a Florence Police officer in 2012, last year gave birth to a daughter and was given office work so she could cope with the phyiscal strains.

However, for this pregnancy the department says they are unable to move her position because of a change in the rules so she'll have to stay on patrol or take the time as unpaid leave

If Trischler stays on unpaid leave, by the time she gives birth to her son she will no longer have medical insurance which is a problem because her son suffers from a rare bone disorder, reports WFSB.

'I was told that I would need to use all the time that I had saved, vacation and sick time. Once that time was all used up, I would need to go on unpaid leave,' said Trischler.

'The time I had saved would be about six weeks I think and from the time I needed to come off the road I wouldn't have made it even close to my delivery so I wouldn't have health insurance by the time I delivered so that was really scary,' she continued.

Trischler, who has a master’s degree in criminal justice, says she is doing her best to work while pregnant but says the weight of the gun is pulling at her stomach and her bullet proof vest no longer fit.

The young mom has now filed a complaint against the city of Florence alleging discrimination.

“I worked very hard to get to this point. This is the career I’ve really wanted. I just want to get back to work,” she told Today.

Forced to choose: Trischler doesn't want to have to choose between being a mother and having a paycheck

'No one should have to choose between their health and having a family and their paycheck,' said Elizabeth Gedmark, staff attorney for the advocacy group A Better Balance.

The city's attorney Hugh O. Skees issued a statement outlining their side of the story saying, 'The city has reviewed the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) complaint filed by officer Trischler. The city does not agree with the allegations of the complaint, but respects the rights of the officer to bring this proceeding before the EEOC.  The city will follow the process in that form and present its defence.'

'I don't think the department would have handled it this way. I think they were just given a policy from the city and I don't think my department had any choice,' said Trischler.

Trischler does not blame the Florence police department and enjoys working as a member of their team.

'I just want to work and earn a pay check so I can take care of the daughter I already have and keep my health benefits,' said Trischler.
