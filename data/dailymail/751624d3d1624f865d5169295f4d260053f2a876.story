Adders are now an endangered species because their hibernation sites are being destroyed, snake experts have warned.

Scientists say Britain's only poisonous snake is in more urgent need of help than any other reptile or amphibian species in the UK.

A conference of conservationists met at the Greenwich University campus in Chatham, Kent, at the weekend to discuss ways of saving the once common snake.

It backed a plan to create a website for a survey project in which volunteers monitor snake numbers at their local sites.

Adders are rapidly declining in numbers and the species is already extinct in some counties, including Nottinghamshire and Warwickshire.

One of the biggest threats is damage to hibernation sites, such as rabbit holes and tree roots.

Herpetologist Dr Chris Gleed-Owen told the Daily Telegraph: 'The adder is an enigmatic snake, steeped in history and folklore, from the druids to Shakespeare and Arthurian legend.

'It would be tragic to see it disappear.'

Despite the drop in numbers, there is anecdotal evidence among vets of an increase in people and pets being bitten by adders this year.

In July, two dogs died in Essex after being bitten by poisonous adders that were out in unusually large numbers because of the hot weather.

There have been 14 known fatalities among humans in Britain since 1876.

The last was a five-year-old child who died in 1975.

Several
anti-venoms are now available which limit the effects to nausea and 
drowsiness, followed by severe bruising and swelling around the bite.

Dogs
and other pets are more susceptible to the venom because they are 
smaller than humans.

And treatment is often delayed because owners often
don't realise what is wrong at first.
