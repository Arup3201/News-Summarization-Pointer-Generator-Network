A pickpocket who targeted young clubbers in a popular nightspot was found with more than 40 mobile phones stashed down his trousers.

Club bosses at Warehouse Project in Trafford Park, Manchester, were tipped off that a number of revellers had lost their phones and arranged for police to search everyone leaving the venue.

They were astonished to find Iulian Cojocaru, 28, with 44 phones stashed in a pair of Lycra cycling shorts under his trousers, including iPhones, Androids and BlackBerry handsets.

Cojocaru, of Dagenham, East London, was arrested and charged with 25 counts of theft.

He pleaded guilty at Trafford Magistrates’ Court and will be sentenced at crown court later this month.

Detectives are continuing to try and trace remaining victims.

Warehouse Project director, Sacha Lord-Marchionne, said ‘dipping’ was becoming a big problem at his and other city venues.

He said more than £40,000 had been spent on security and police patrols in and around his venue since September.

Mr Lord-Marchionne added: 'People are stood touching each other on the dance floor so it is ideal for pickpockets to operate.

'We give advice to vulnerable young people telling girls to keep their handbags zipped up and telling boys to keep their phones in their front pockets.'

Det Insp Debbie Oakes, from Greater Manchester Police, said: 'We work closely with the event organisers who will continue to operate a tight security operation where searches take place on entry and exit.'
