Used to be friends: Kimberly Hayes (pictured) was found dead on a dirt road last month and more than a month later police have arrested her four roommates in connection to the murder

Investigators believe a 35-year-old mother was murdered and set on fire last month in a custody battle over her roommates' newborn baby.

A water district employee on his way to work when he found Kimberly Hayes' body still smoldering on a dirt road the morning of March 9.

Now, more than a month later, authorities have arrested four suspects they believe carried out and kept her murder a secret.

On April 18, police arrested 29-year-old Jessi Mendoza at a hotel in El Cajon on charges of murder and arson and he is currently being held on $2million bail at the San Diego County Jail.

Mendoza's girlfriend and two other roommates were also arrested. Couple Matthew Williams, 30, and Lauren Huett, 33 were arrested at the same hotel while girlfriend Jennifer Stein, 31, was arrested the next day at the Santee Sheriff's Station.

'They were aware of the plan to kill her beforehand, and then the three of them did attempt to conceal the murder crime afterward,' said Lt. Glenn Giannantonio with the sheriffâ€™s department.

Williams was arrested on suspicion of murder and held on $1million while his girlfriend Huett was charged with conspiracy and accessory. Stein was released on bail Monday afternoon after being booked Saturday.

Authorities believe Hayes was killed because she was trying to gain custody of Mendoza and Stein's newborn baby. Why she believed she was entitled to parenting rights remains uncertain, but it is believed that the victim and four suspects 'informally' lived together in the same apartment.

'I canâ€™t go into any details about that except to say Ms Hayes was attempting to gain custody of Stein and Mendozaâ€™s child,' Lt Giannantonio said. 'From what I know, it was by legal means.'

Hayes seemed to be on good terms with Mendoza and his girlfriend Stein as recently as February 3 when she shared pictures of her recently inked hand tattoo which reads 'Trust no man' between the left fingers.

'Thank you Jessi Mendoza lovin my new tats!!!' Hayes wrote. 'Thank you to you and Jennifer Stein u guys always seem to be there when I need a shoulder to cry on !! I may need to lean on u guys for a hot min as im so close to the edge [sic].'

According to investigators, Hayes was murdered at that apartment on March 8 and her body was moved the next morning to the dirt road where it was burned.

Mendoza went on to distance himself from his social networking sites following Hayes' death.

On April 14, just four days before his arrest, Mendoza wrote on Facebook: 'Well I'm tired of the fb drama n unecessarry bs that comes with it so Ima deactivate for a Lil bit if u know me well enug u got my # or kno how to reach me [sic].'

The victim's father Harvey Hayes, 77, from Clovis, told U-T San Diego that his daughter lived a troubled life.

He says she had been released from jail just six days before she was killed.

Hayes had a 14-year-old daughter of her own who she sent to live with her father several years ago due to her long hours working as an EMT at Scripps Hospital Emergency Room.

Lately she had been out of work however, because of a wrist injury and subsequent surgeries.
