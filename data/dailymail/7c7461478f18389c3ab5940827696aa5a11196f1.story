The number of Britons living in million-pound homes will soar to 500,000 by the end of the year as rising demand and foreign investment leads to a boom in the housing market.

Almost 9,000 homes a month will top the £1million mark between now and December, meaning there will be 50 per cent more property millionaires than in October 2007 when the recession began.

Around 35,000 homeowners have already been elevated into the millionaire's club so far this year, with the vast majority of those being in London.

The number of Britons living in home worth £1million is set to increase by 9,000 every month until 2015

So far this year 35,000 British homeowners have already seen the value of their homes top £1million, with the vast majority of those being in London (pictured)

However, in signs that the house-price recovery is moving out of the capital, the south east and south west recorded large rises in the number of property millionaires, with Wales and Yorkshire also seeing small increases.

According to research conducted by property website zoopla.co.uk for The Telegraph, the total number of homes valued at more than £1million grew by 34,374 in four months to the end of April to a total of 427,501.

More than half of that total, 271,000, were in London, where average prices have risen to £414,490 meaning that 31,000 extra people are now inhabiting million-pound homes.

The average cost of a three-bed family home in 'prime' areas of the city is now £1.67million and expected to rise to £2million by 2015, with the definition of 'prime' now includes Battersea and Clapham, not traditionally rich places.

High demand and foreign investment is largely behind the spike in prices. Earlier this week an Eastern European buyer paid £140million for a penthouse at One Hyde Park (pictured), a record for a flat in Britain

The average cost of a three-bedroom home in 'prime' areas of London is expected to be £2milllion by 2015. This flat in Grosvenor Square in the most expensive per-square-foot in Mayfair, and costs a whopping total of £18million

In the UK as a whole, the average house now costs £180,000, a jump of 7.9 per cent since December last year and the largest annual rise since October 2007.

The cost of an average home is now at its highest level since June 2008. In February 2013, the average price was £163,468.

While demand for property is causing house values to peak across the South, the North and Midlands saw falls in the number of million-pound houses.

The spike in property values is being caused by demand far outstripping supply, with foreign investors also driving values up.

It is not just London that has since houses jump in price, with values rising across the south. Actress Vivien Leigh's home in Sussex recently went on sale for £3.5million

Former cricketer Graeme Swann also put his home in Lincolnshire on the market for £1.2million recently. Nearby Yorkshire and the Humber saw million-pound properties rise slightly in the last 12 months

Earlier this week Penthouse D at One Hyde Park became the most expensive flat ever sold in the UK after a wealthy Eastern European snapped up the unfurnished property for £140million.

Despite the apartment having no walls or floors, it was snapped up for a record-breaking price tag, with some experts speculating it was used as a safe way for a billionaire to get money out of Russia or Ukraine as the crisis there escalates.

In other cities such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester, many new-build flats were being sold directly to Chinese investors for 25 to 30 per cent above market value .

Experts have warned that such growth is not sustainable. This week the Bank of England deputy governor warned that a housing price bubble is the biggest threat to the UK recovery.
