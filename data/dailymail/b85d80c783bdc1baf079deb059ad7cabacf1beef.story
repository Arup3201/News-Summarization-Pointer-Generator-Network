A farmer’s wife admitted burying her husband and hiding his death from the authorities so she could carry on claiming thousands of pounds of his benefits.

Widow Rebekah Sturdey, 56, hid her husband Geoffrey's body on their remote farm in Beth Berith near Tregaron, West Wales, and collected more than £70,000 of state handouts until she was caught in 2012.

Mr Sturdey was 60-years-old when he was last seen alive in October 2008, but his body was only discovered by police last year after the Department of Work and Pensions became 'concerned about the farmer’s welfare'.

Cover-up: The body of Geoffrey Sturdey was hidden by his wife Rebekah on a remote farm in West Wales

Swansea Crown Court heard how the Iranian-born Mrs Sturdey took disability and pensions allowance in her spouse's name for four years.

She pleaded guilty to preventing the lawful and decent burial of her husband and was told she could face jail.

Two other women - the farmer’s carer Boqer-Ore Adie, 43, and friend Carmel Adie, 24 - also admitted the same charge.

Boqer-Ore Adie’s daughter Hazel Adie, 20, pleaded not guilty which was accepted by the prosecution.

The four women lived together at the isolated smallholding with Mr Sturdey.

Mrs Sturdey helped on her husband’s 20-acre farm when he became disabled and employed Boqer-Orie Adie as his full-time carer.

Prosecutor Jacqui Lis told an earlier hearing: 'All four women were arrested after inquiries had been made by the Department of Work and Pensions as to Mr Sturdey’s whereabouts.'

Sturdey and Boqer-Ore Adie admitted fraud by failing to notify authorities they were in receipt of disability allowance and pension credits in the farmer’s name.

The court heard Sturdey and Boqer-Ore Adie had claimed £21,700 in disability allowance and £36,000 in pension credits.

Boqer-Ore Adie claimed a further £9,400 in carer’s allowance and £10,100 in income support for Mr Sturdey.

Judge Keith Thomas adjourned the hearing until next month after telling all three women they could face jail.

He said: 'All options, including prison will be open to me.'

Sturdey and Boqer-Ore Adie were remanded in custody and Carmel Adie was released on bail.
