Target has released a Merida doll who, with her glossy, wavy hair and dainty features, looks more like a Barbie than the feisty Scottish princess from Pixar's Brave.

The unrecognizable toy is being launched just days after Disney sparked controversy for giving Merida a 'sexy' make-over - a decision that was criticized in a 200,000-strong petition, prompting the company to remove the image from their website.

In contrast to Merida's untamed curls and endearing looks in the movie, this new doll, part of Target's Ultimate 
Disney Princess Collection, has a polished, styled haircut, disproportionately thin limbs and nondescript facial features that could seemingly belong to any other princess.

Even the Target doll's baby blue dress is nothing like the real number she wears in the movie.

Writer Laura Beck expressed her dismay at the doll: 'This 
Merida is completely unrecognizable as anything other than a 
conservatively dressed Barbie with a weird belt on,' she wrote on Jezebel.

Other critics voiced their opinion that the new depiction of Merida is a bad role model for young Disney fans.

'This is really annoying,' wrote one woman of the new, thinner doll.

'They wonder why girls end up freaking out about
their weight and looks starting at a young age!'

It's not the first time a conventionally prettier depiction of the spunky heroine has caused an outcry.

Merida made headlines earlier this month when Disney gave her a 'sexy' make-over in the lead-up to her 'coronation' as one of the 11 official Disney princesses.

A picture of the updated princess on 
Disney's website showed her with a smaller waist, bouncier curls and 
higher cheekbones, a far cry from the frizzy mop of red hair and 
authentic teenage looks she sports in the movie.

Not just a pretty face: Both the Disney and Target make-overs strip Merida of her unique red curls and fuller and more realistic body shape, as well as her trusty bow and arrow

A 200,000-strong petition called for Disney to revoke the 'sexist' make-over, which was seen as 'a tremendous disservice to 
the millions of children for whom Merida is an empowering role model.'

The original Merida, who rode through the Scottish Highlands shooting arrows with conviction, 'speaks to girls' capacity to be change agents in the world rather than just trophies to be admired,' stated the petition.

Shortly after the petition was launched, Disney quietly removed the controversial picture from their website.

However, executives at the company have since defended the make-over.

'It's designed to match the look of the other Disney Princess characters - to make them all appear as if they stepped out of the same world instead of differing across decades of artistic styles,' explains a statement on Disney news website, InsideTheMagic.

And Catherine Connors, editor in chief of Disney Interactive Family, explained on her blog: 'These are fancified depictions of Merida, not a new Merida.

'The gussied up Merida on the coronation invitation is Merida gussied up for one of the most important events of her princess career,' she continued.

'That she's a little more sparkly for the party is not a heresy against her independent and spirited self.'
