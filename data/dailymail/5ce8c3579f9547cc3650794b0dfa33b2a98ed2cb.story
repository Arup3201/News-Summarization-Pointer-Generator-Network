When Paula O'Brien and Abbey Donohoe first met at a party thrown by a mutual friend four years ago in Bettendrof, Iowa, the other guests were struck by how alike they both looked.

The comparisons even went as far as calling 29-year-old Abbey and 39-year-old Paula sisters - but incredibly, a Facebook posting from last week revealed those first impressions to be not so far from the truth.

On Wednesday, March 6th, Paula sent out a heartfelt post recalling how her brother gave up his daughter for adoption almost 30-years-ago, which set in motion a chain of events which revealed that Abbey was in fact that child - Paula's niece.

The accidental discovery ended almost three-decades of wondering for Paula and her family - and amazed Abbey, who had never even searched for her biological parents.

On September, 19th, 1982, when Paula was ten-years-old, her brother and his girlfriend at the time gave up Abbey because they could not bring her up in the way they wanted.

'On Sept. 19, 1982, my very first niece was born and given up for adoption,' reads Paula's March 6th post.

'I know it wasnâ€™t an easy decision for my brother to make, but it was the right one for that baby girl. Hope you can take a moment to read this & be thankful for the selfless sacrifice of adoption.

'I know many families whose hearts are full because of it.'

The Facebook post that started it all last week: Paula made this heartfelt statement and soon after Abbey joined the dots

Paula was ten-years-old when her niece Abbey was given up for adoption by her brother - and the family celebrated her birthday every year in her absence

Abbey Donohoe had a happy childhood and never felt the need to try and contact her biological family

Back at home, Abbey read this post and matched up the date, which she knew to be the date that she was given up for adoption.

Abbey commented on the post writing, 'You sure it wasn't 1983? Because that's my birthday & I was adopted...crazy!'

Immediately, Paula sent Abbey a private message with her parent's names and asked her to check.

'She e-mailed back and said - 'Oh my goodness, it sounds like you're my Aunt!' said Paula to WQAD.Com.

Reunited with her biological family, Abbey has spent the past week being introduced to relatives that she has never met and her grandmother is due to visit from Arizona to meet her for the first time.

'This is truly a miracle,' said Paula to WQAD.Com. 'We just feel like our prayers have been answered.'

'It was really hard for my entire family to deal with,' said Paula to WQAD.Com.

'We experienced that loss and we never forgot about that baby. We never gave up her. We observed her birthday every year. It never left our minds.'

Having known each other through their Bettendorf theater group, the two women were stunned to discover that they were related.

'It was just a surreal,' said Donohoe to KWQC.Com. 'Did I really just accidentally find my birth family?'
