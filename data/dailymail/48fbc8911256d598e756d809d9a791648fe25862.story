An 86-year-old World War II veteran was recovering Tuesday after being attacked by a mugger outside a southwest Ohio hospital where he was visiting his ailing wife, authorities said.

Police arrested 30-year-old Craig Phelps on charges of robbery and other counts including that he had a needle for heroin use. Phelps was being held Tuesday in Hamilton County Jail on $25,000 bond.

Police said Phelps tried to steal 86-year-old Paul Browning's wallet outside Good Samaritan Hospital Sunday.

Ambushed: Mr Browning was leaving Good Samaritan Hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio, Sunday, when he was jumped by a man trying to steal his wallet 

Browning was at the hospital visiting his wife of 65 years, 89-year-old Ilda Browning, who has been recovering from an operation. Family members say the two met in Italy during World War II.

Phelps is accused of 'slamming the victim against a wall, causing severe physical harm to his face,' a police affidavit stated. 

Family members say Mr Browning was left severely bruised and swollen and required stitches in his mouth, and was expected to be hospitalized a few days.

Browning's son, Marvin Browning, said he got jumped just after leaving the hospital to go to his car.

'After he beat him down to the ground and tried to take his wallet, my dad let him know he wasn't going to get his wallet. Then he reached down and helped lift him up and told him he was sorry and that he thought he was somebody else,' Marvin Browning told the station WLWT. 

Aftermath: The octogenarian was left with a badly swollen cheek and cuts in his mouth that required stitches

Fearing that Phelps might come back for him, the brutally beaten veteran then got into his car and drove himself home. 

Mr Browning's family later brought him back to the hospital for treatment.

Police officers who apprehended Phelps in the hospital parking lot led him into Mr Browning's room to be identified as he was receiving medical attention.  

The victim's relatives described the octogenarian veteran as tough, and said that he is expected to recover. However, while treating the veteran for his injuries, doctors discovered that he was suffering from irregular heartbeat.

Mistaken identity: The 30-year-old suspected mugger allegedly helped his elderly victim up after the beating and apologized, saying that he mistook him for someone else  

The 86-year-old Mr Browning is now expected to undergo surgery on his heart.

'He's like dad always is, he'll be OK,' his son said. 'That's just what he says, "Everything's OK."'

Phelps is being held on $25,000 bail. He is due back in court September 10. 

On his Facebook page, the 30-year-old father of a young daughter listed his occupation as a foreman for a contractor. His online photo album contains multiple images of Phelps posing with assault rifles, handguns and tactical gear.
