Mark Clattenburg will take charge of this weekend's top-of-the-table clash between Chelsea and Manchester City at Stamford Bridge.

The 39-year-old, who took charge of West Brom's 2-1 FA Cup win against rivals Birmingham on Saturday, is yet to referee league leaders Chelsea this season. 

In October 2013, Chelsea accused the referee of using ‘inappropriate language’ after a 3-2 defeat at home to Manchester United, when Ramires claimed to have heard Clattenburg aim a racist insult at team-mate John Obi Mikel.

The referee was removed from the match-list but soon cleared by the FA and police dropped their investigation.

Nigeria international Mikel was banned for three games and fined £60,000 for entering the referee’s room after the game.

Clattenburg made his first return to Stamford Bridge in April 2014 as Chelsea defeated Swansea 2-0 courtesy of goals from Oscar and Frank Lampard.

Meanwhile, Clattenburg has refereed Manchester City twice during the current 2014/15 campaign.

The Premier League official shared the field with City's top stars during their 2-2 draw with Arsenal back in September and 3-1 Boxing Day victory against West Brom.

Clattenburg has not handed out a red card since September 21, when he was forced into sending off Manchester United defender Tyler Blackett during Leicester's incredible 5-3 win.

Chelsea's home match against City is expected to be a lively affair as just five points separate the two Premier League heavyweights.
