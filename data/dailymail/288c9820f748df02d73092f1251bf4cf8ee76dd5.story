Two teenage girls have been sentenced to six to 23 months in prison for savagely beating a disabled woman in front of her apartment in Chester, Pennsylvania.

Jasmir Womack, 17, of Philadelphia, pleaded guilty on Thursday to charges of conspiracy to commit aggravated assault and conspiracy to recklessly endanger another person. Rahmiiyah Henderson, 16, pleaded guilty to the same charges on Tuesday in the September 25, 2012, attack.

The girls are among six teens who 
allegedly kicked and beat the mentally ill woman on her front steps and 
then continued the violence inside after she tried to escape.

Both teens were also sentenced to two years of consecutive probation, according to the Delaware County Daily Times.

Investigators used a cell phone video of the beating that was uploaded on YouTube to identify the defendants. The four juveniles in the case were charged as adults.

In court yesterday, Womack's attorney, Tracie Burns, described the incident as 'a very bad act.' According to the Daily Times, Burns said it was 'a poor, poor, poor exercise in judgment that resulted in injury to somebody else.'

But she blamed comprehension and foresight difficulties that mean Womack is unable to understand the consequences of her actions.

The teen said sorry for her part in the beating and said she hopes the victim is OK. The girls will attend school and anger management classes in addition to serving out their sentences.

Three other defendants - Jamia Davis, 15, Janyea Bell and Anye Dennis, both 16 — have hearings scheduled for March 11 and could still be tried as juveniles.

Takia Nicole Edwards, 19, who is the sole adult in the case, is due in court on February 26.

The six teens were arrested on September 28 for allegedly brutally beating a mentally disabled woman 'just for fun,' and then posting a video of the savage attack on Facebook.

The attack on the 48-year-old woman shook Chester, a city just outside Philadelphia.

Grave allegations: Anye Dennis, 16, left, Takia Nicole Edwards, 19, right, were charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and a host of other counts in connection with the attack

Anye Dennis, 16, Henderson, 16, Jamia Davis, 15, and Janyea Bell, 16, were charged with aggravated assault, simple assault, burglary, reckless endangerment and harassment charges, according to Philadelphia Inquirer.

They have been held in the Delaware County Prison on $50,000 bail each.

According to police, the suspects attacked the woman, whom police described as 'mentally challenged' at random as she sat on the stoop outside her home on September 25.

The victim was punched, kicked and hit with a shoe and chair, and suffered cuts and bruises but no broken bones, authorities said. Her name was not released.

'It appears just for fun,' Chester police Detective James Nolan said at the time. 'There hasn't been a discernible explanation as to why.'

Police Commissioner Joseph M. Bail Jr.
said the victim treated for 
lacerations and abrasions but survived the attack without serious injury.

Chester Police Detective James Nolan said that the girls initially showed no remorse.

'It was a big party and they're still 
defiant,' Nolan said. 'There's no discernible reason for what happened 
other than fun, sport.'

The video, in which the teens 
approached the 48-year-old woman outside her 
home, was uploaded onto Facebook.

A
concerned parent saw the video and notified the Philadelphia police, 
who were able to identify the six girls who carried out the brutal 
attack, which took place at 9:15 p.m.

The video begins as the six teens stand at a street corner in the Chester neighborhood of the city.

They laugh and joke with one another before turning their attention on the woman sitting on her stoop a few feet away.

'Talk to her first. Talk to her first,' one of the girls can be heard saying in the cell phone video.

They approach the woman, saying something indiscernible, and she responds. Then, without warning, one of the teens punches the woman, the others following her lead.

The woman crawls inside her home, but the girls follow her, kicking and hitting her the whole way. The victim climbs to her couch but the teens crawl on top her, one even hitting her with a chair.

Throughout the whole ordeal, the girls laugh and complain that the woman's home is 'stinky.'

The attack lasts about 90 seconds. The girls can be seen running out of the home when they are through.

'We out. We out. We out,' one of the girls says.

The woman sought medical attention after the incident, but never told authorities.

Remorseless: Police said that the random attack was carried out 'just for fun,' and even in jail the teenage girls do not feel sorry for their actions

'Her face is all beat up, swelling,' neighbor Ken Worly said to ABC.

Detective Nolan said it was rare to have proof of such an attack.

'This is something that occurs in the city that normally we don't have evidence of,' he said. 'You hear about things like this, but you generally don't see them firsthand, as in this account.'

District Attorney Jack Whelan said he 
did not hesitate to charge the teenagers as adults.

'The message is clear, if you are 
going to act violently, if your behavior is equivalent to animalistic 
behavior, then we will treat you accordingly, we will treat you as 
adults in the criminal-justice system,' he said.

Enrique Latoison, the attorney for one
of the 16-year-old girls, denied the teens were not feeling remorse in the days following their arrest.

'She's 16, never been in trouble a day
in her life. She's in good standing in school,' Latoison told ABCNews.com. 'She's very upset about the situation.'

Latoison said his client was 'very upset and crying' when he visited her in jail in September.

He added that his client was present 
during the beating, but never touched the woman. Latoison said that the 
teens and the victim knew each other.
