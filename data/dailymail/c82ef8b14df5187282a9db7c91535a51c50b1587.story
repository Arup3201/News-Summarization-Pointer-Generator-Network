A six-year-old boy whose mother forced him into a dog cage then poured syrup and kitty litter on him was rescued after neighbors heard him screaming, 'Do you love me?' to his abuser, authorities said.

The boy's mother, Crystal Jean Hostetter, 24, and her long-term girlfriend, Sarah Elizabeth McClain, 30, allegedly abused the boy - who has psychological issues and does not like sticky substances - for two hours on Saturday. Neighbors witnessed the treatment and alerted authorities.

The two women, from Douglasville, Georgia, appeared in front of a Douglas County Magistrate on Thursday, where they were both charged with cruelty to children.

'Cruel': Crystal Hostetter, left, and her girlfriend, Sarah McClain, right, allegedly forced Hostetter's six-year-old son into a dog cage and poured syrup and kitty litter on him and forced him to hold up a brick

They allegedly forced the boy into a small crate, covered his feet and hands with syrup and kitty litter and also made him hold a brick above his head for 15 minutes, police told the Douglas County Sentinel.

The boy was heard screaming, 'Please don't kill me!' and 'Do you love me?', police said.

Hostetter carried out the treatment to punish her son and told cops she poured syrup on him because she knew he did not like it, Douglasville Police Sgt. Todd Garner said.

'He
 acts out based on the things that they have diagnosed him with and she 
doesn't like that so she has issued these forms of punishment,' Garner 
said.

'She has also gone to the point of taking his bed out and making 
him sleep on the floor because he slept on the floor one night. So she 
said, "If you don't like your bed, you cannot have it".'

'Sick': The couple allegedly used the treatment as punishment for the boy (pictured), who suffers from psychological problems. They chose syrup because they knew he hates sticky substances

He added that the child is supposed to be on medication, but Hostetter has failed to collect them.

'Heâ€™s supposed to be on three different medications that 
she has not filled or given him,' Garner said. 'In our conversation, I asked her, "You 
just think that you know more than the doctors?" She said yes.'

He
 did not detail the extent of the boy's psychological issues, but said 
that he had been hospitalized earlier this year in Pennsylvania.

According to police, a neighbor witnessed the boy being abused on Saturday and called the Department of Children and Family Services hotline, but when they could not get through, they contacted the boy's school and police were called.

Jailed: The women were arrested after a neighbor witnessed the treatment and alerted authorities, and the boy is now in the custody of an adult caregiver

When police arrived, they found the home covered in fleas from the couple's three cats.

Hostetter and McClain admitted to the 
alleged crimes after a DFCS worker came to their home on Monday 
evening, the County Sentinel reported.

The youngster is now staying at the home with an adult caregiver, while the women are being held without bond in the Douglas County jail.

The couple, who have been dating for three years,
 moved from Pennsylvania in March and 
police are looking into whether there have been reports in Pennsylvania 
of similar treatment.
