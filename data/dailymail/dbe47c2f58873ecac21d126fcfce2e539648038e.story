When she stepped out at the Serpentine Gallery Summer Party 
last week dressed in a royal 
blue L’ Wren Scott dress, she won a place on Vogue.com’s coveted 
best dressed list for the first time.

And Princess Beatrice continued to show off her style credentials as she headed out in London last night to enjoy an evening with friends at exclusive nightclub Cirque le Soir.

The flame-haired young Royal donned a quilted leather skirt, black top and black court shoes, which she teamed with a sparkly pink Anya Hindmarch clutch bag.

Style credentials: Princess Beatrice has been showing off her more stylish side lately and last night stepped out in all all black ensemble on a night out in London

She looked like she has been making the most of the British sun as she showed off a radiant tan.

The party-loving princess appeared to be flying solo and her boyfriend Dave Clark, who she is usually seen out and about with, was nowhere to be seen.

But in the absence of her beau, who is working on a Virgin Galactic space tourism project, she shared a warm embrace with a male friend outside the prestigious nightclub.

The princess, 24, has been dating
Dave - who was introduced to Beatrice by her cousin and his school 
friend Prince William - since 2006.

Black out: The young Royal donned a quilted leather skirt, black top and black court shoes, which she teamed with a glitzy pink clutch bag as she partied with friends at Cirque le Soir

Who's your friend? Bea's long-term boyfriend Dave Clark was nowhere to be seen

As well as being a favourite of the young Royals Cirque le Soir attracts a galaxy of stars including Lady Gaga, Leonardo
DiCaprio, Rihanna, Kanye West, Madonna and
Nicole Scherzinger.

Guests inside the circus-themed nightclub are treated to shows from magicians, clowns, 
sword-swallowers, fire-eaters, burlesque angle grinders and snake 
charmers, among a host of other weird and wonderful entertainment.

Her appearance at the celebrity haunt
is just the latest in a string of late nights for the Princess, who partied until the small hours last week at the Serpentine summer party as well as at 
members-only club LouLou’s in the last fortnight.

Roll up: The Cirque le Soir website promises guests the 'most exclusive circus in London'

Cuddles: Bea shared an embrace with her friend as she left the nightclub- a hangout regularly frequented by the young Royals

Beatrice has been looking super stylish of late and using date nights with her boyfriend and nights on the town to put her new-found fashion choices to the test.

Her and her sister Eugenie's new look is down to the ‘Mary Poppins’ of the style world, Sarah Hogan, who was brought in by the Duchess of York to be her daughters’ fashion mentor.

Ms Hogan does not disclose her fees, but given that she is on the speed dials of some of the best-dressed women in London and New York, her services will not come cheap.

Meanwhile, Beatrice and Eugenie do not accept any discounts, paying full price for all their outfits.

It is an expensive commitment and proof, if it were needed, of their wish to take on a more prominent role.

Getting it right: Bea has developed a new sense of style with the help of Sarah Hogan, she even topped Vogue's best dressed list for her outfit at the Serpentine party (L)
