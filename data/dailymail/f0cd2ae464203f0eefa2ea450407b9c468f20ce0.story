Police are searching for a top ranking officer who went missing from his home at the weekend.

Tim Frohwein, 48, who is currently Chief Inspector at Chesterfield, was last seen around 2pm in Buxton, Derbyshire, on Sunday.

Last night, as mountain rescue teams called off their search in the Goyt Valley near Mr Frohwein's home, his younger son Joel, who will be 19 tomorrow, wrote on Twitter that he wished he could turn the clock back to before his father went missing.

Derbyshire Police said officers are becoming increasingly concerned for the wellbeing of Tim Frohwein because he is recovering from recent knee surgery

Joel Frohwein wrote: 'The things I would do to take time back to Saturday.'

His father, an experienced police officer who covers Amber Valley
and Chesterfield in Derbyshire, was previously head of roads policing.

Derbyshire Police said officers are becoming increasingly concerned for his wellbeing because he is recovering from recent knee surgery.

Assistant Chief Constable Dee Collins said: 'This is totally out of character for Tim and I'm extremely concerned about him, particularly as the weather was so cold last night.

'We have carried out extensive searches, with the assistance of the local Mountain Rescue teams who have given us their full support, as they always do.

'I would be very grateful if anyone who has seen Tim since he went missing could contact us. And I'd also like to appeal to Tim himself to get in touch. His family are very worried about him.'

Mr Frohwein, who joined the police force in 1987 aged 22, has worked for the Kent, Cheshire and Derbyshire police forces in roles as uniform, sergeant and inspector.

He is also a trained hostage negotiator, and spent five years working as international development director for MxM, an NGO with offices in the US, UK, Cyprus and the Middle East.

Mr Frohwein is married to Susan, 54, and has sons Christian, 21, and Joel, 19 tomorrow.

Mr Frohwein, who studied physical education and economic geography at University College, Chester after attending Kingham Hill boarding school in Oxfordshire was last seen wearing a three-quarter length dark coat, pale blue shirt and brown jeans.

He has short dark hair and wears glasses, and may be carrying a walking pole.

Anyone who sees a man matching this description, or who has information as to his whereabouts, should call police on 101.
