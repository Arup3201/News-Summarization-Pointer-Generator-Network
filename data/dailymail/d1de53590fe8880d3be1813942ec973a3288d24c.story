Jesse Lingard's chances of impressing Louis van Gaal in the coming weeks have suffered a blow after the Manchester United midfielder was pictured leaving hospital on crutches and with his right leg in a brace.

The 21-year-old made his Premier League debut against Swansea on Saturday but lasted just 24 minutes after being injured in a challenge with Ashley Williams.

Lingard received treatment on his leg while on the pitch but was unable to continue. He eventually limped off and was replaced by Adnan Januzaj.

The severity of Lingard's injury remains unclear, but he looks certain to miss Sunday's trip to Sunderland.

The former Birmingham and Brighton loanee, who needed crutches to leave Bridgewater Hospital in Manchester on Sunday, becomes the latest name to join Van Gaal's list of injured players.

Jonny Evans, Rafael, Luke Shaw, Antonio Valencia, Danny Welbeck, Anderson and Michael Carrick all missed the 2-1 defeat by Garry Monk's side at Old Trafford.

Lingard was employed in an unfamiliar right wing back role as United's new boss implemented his preferred 3-5-2 formation in his first Premier League match in charge.

The injury leaves Van Gaal short of options for the clash with Gus Poyet's side, although he is still pursuing a deal for Sporting Lisbon defender Marcos Rojo.
