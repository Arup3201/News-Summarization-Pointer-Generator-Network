The families of the two British Gurkhas killed by a policeman in Afghanistan yesterday have paid tribute to the 'brave' servicemen.

Lieutenant Edward Drummond-Baxter, 29, and Lance Corporal Siddhanta Kunwar, 28, were shot by a man wearing Afghan police uniform in Nahr-e-Saraj, Helmand province.

This latest ‘green-on-blue’ attack brings the number of British servicemen killed by Afghan soldiers or police to 11 this year.

The pair, of 1st Battalion The Royal 
Gurkha Rifles, were praised by their commanding officer for their 
bravery and commitment to the force.

The
incident occurred yesterday when L/Cpl Kunwar from Pokhara, Nepal, and 
Lt Drummond-Baxter, of County Durham, were attending a meeting with Afghan police at a check point in Nahr-e Saraj.

It is believed that one of the men wearing police uniform opened fire, the
Ministry of Defence said.

Edward Drummond-Baxter was on his first deployment to Afghanistan and had only arrived on September 30.

Inside attacks: The deaths of Lt Drummond-Baxter and L/Cpl Kunawar brings the total number of fatal 'green-on-blue' attacks within NATO's International Security Assistance Force to 56

His family paid tribute to the ‘fiercely loyal and totally sincere’  the 29-year-old Psychology graduate today.

His
mother Helen, father David and sister Emily said in a statement: ‘He loved the Gurkhas
and died among friends doing the job that he wanted to do.’

Lt Drummond-Baxter was born in Peterborough and was an active member of his local 
Territorial Army regiment during his studies at University College 
London.

He subsequently spent two years working for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, before joining the British Army.

After attending Sandhurst military college, he was commissioned into the 1st Battalion The Royal Gurkha Rifles in December 2010.

Lieutenant
Colonel David Robinson, commanding officer 1st Battalion The Royal 
Gurkha Rifles, said: ‘Our battalion has lost a character, a true 
gentleman and an inspirational leader in Lieutenant Edward 
Drummond-Baxter.

'His 
Gurkha soldiers noticeably responded to his dedication to them but also 
to his great wit and humour. They would follow him anywhere.

‘His
natural empathy and rapport for his soldiers was evident to everyone. 
It was never a surprise to find him spending additional time with them, 
whether seeking to further their professional development or just 
enjoying their company. The tragedy of his loss is beyond words.

‘He
was also utterly courageous and had already proved himself such a calm 
and steady leader under fire that his men knew they were in the best of 
hands.

‘Edward 
Drummond-Baxter was a Gurkha officer in the finest tradition and his 
loss will be deeply felt by all those who had the privilege and honour 
of knowing him.’

Corporal Hirabahadur Phagami said: ‘Throughout my career Lieutenant Drummond-Baxter was one of the best platoon commanders.

‘He was always calm and caring to all of us. Always a smile on his face no matter how difficult the task was.

‘May his soul rest in peace. I will forever remember him. May God bless his family.'

Lance
Corporal Kunawar was on his third tour of Afghanistan with the Gurkhas 
and was a role model for younger soldiers, Lt Col Robinson said.

‘Strong
and highly experienced, he stood out from the crowd, not only as a 
highly capable sniper but also for his smile and sense of fun, whatever 
the situation he found himself in.

‘The younger soldiers responded greatly to his guidance and experience but also to his caring nature.

‘Siddhanta was a proud soldier and was immensely proud to be a Gurkha.

‘He
was one of the cornerstones of the Sniper Platoon, where he was part of
a close-knit team who were justifiably confident in their ability.

‘He would have done anything to support his comrades and friends around him. I know they will miss him deeply.'

The family of L/Cpl Kunwar spoke of their shock and disbelief of their loss.

‘He enjoyed immensely his profession and was fully committed towards it,’ they said in a statement.

’He has made us proud and the whole family misses him dearly.’

The
shooting of the troops by an Afghan they believed to be on their side takes the number of 
British servicemen and women killed in 'green on blue' insider
attacks to 11, and the total number within NATO’s International
Security Assistance Force to 56.

An Afghan police official in the southern province of Helmand said efforts were underway to apprehend the policeman involved.

The deaths of Lieutenant Drummond-Baxter and Lance Corporal Kunawar take the total number of 
UK service members to have lost their lives since operations in 
Afghanistan began in October 2001 to 437.

Last week it was revealed two British 
soldiers shot dead in Afghanistan may have been the victims of a revenge
attack by local police.

Corporal Channing Day, 25, of 3 
Medical Regiment and Corporal David O’Connor, 27, of 40 Commando, Royal 
Marines, were previously thought to have been caught up in a so-called 
‘friendly fire’ incident.

But
after interviewing witnesses and recovering fragments of ammunition, 
Royal Military Police investigators have ruled out the theory that the 
pair were shot by British Forces.

A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed that the deaths were caused by ‘a third party... not UK personnel’.

And
Defence Secretary Philip Hammond – asked whether the British personnel 
had been killed in a ‘green on blue’ attack, when Afghan personnel turn 
on their British partners – said: ‘There is a possibility that that is 
what has happened but it is not clear at this stage.’
