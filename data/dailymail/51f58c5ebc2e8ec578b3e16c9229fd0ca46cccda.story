What do Jennifer Lopez, Ashton Kutcher and David Hasselhoff have in common?

They all swoon over the Koalas at Sydney Wild Life Zoo. This week, Media Animal TV has featured the superstar Koalas at the popular attraction.

Despite sleeping for 85 per cent of his day, these mellow marsupials still manage to hang with more stars than Opera Winfrey.

'We've had all sorts of celebrities here. I saw David Hasselhoff run through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas, just to get there in time to have his photo taken,' says Kylie Hackshaw, the zoo mammal keeper.

'We had Susan Boyle, who was ecstatic and giggly to see our koalas. We've also had Kings Of Leon from the rock front, who were just as excited and they were just lovely when they came in.'

So what is it that magnetises Hollywood icons to these koalas?

Maybe between all the meet-and-greets and exclusive nightclubs, celebs want to hang with someone who can help them unwind.

Few animals know how to relax like the Koala. Media Animal TV also explored a day in the life of Aaron, an adolescent koala who sleeps for 20 hours a day.

Baywatch star David Hasselfoff, who zookeeper Kylie Mackshaw says 'ran through the entire zoo before he got to the koalas, just to get there in time to have his photo taken'

Hackshaw says the koalas job is 'just to sit there and look cute'

'Some people think he might be a bit sloth like, but that's just a typical Koala' Hackshaw says.

'He's a pampered little Koala. He gets the best leaves twice a day and fresh water every day.'

'His job is just to sit there and look cute.'

Sadly, it seems like all the celebrity attention could be going to their heads. Earlier this year, we learned the Sydney Wildlife Koalas were infatuated with taking selfies after a collection of pouting snaps from inside their enclosure made a splash online.

It seems all that time rubbing shoulders with the stars has started to make them conceited, but in the end of the day, who can blame them?
