A pair of student lovebirds who met in their first week of university got engaged just three months later.

Doting 19-year-olds Kate Wood and James Carter plan to spend the rest of their lives together after their eyes first locked over a badminton net in their freshers' week.

Three months later, James got down on one knee, produced a diamond ring and proposed to Kate during a romantic getaway.

Kate Wood and James Carter met at the University in East Anglia and got engaged three months later 

James and Kate met whilst playing badminton during freshers' week 

James proposed to Kate in January whilst the couple were on holiday in Istanbul, presenting her with this pretty diamond ring

The students at the University of East Anglia, in Norwich, are to move out of their halls of residence and into a flat together.

Politics student Kate told student newspaper The Tab how they met on 3 October: 'We were playing badminton and we got talking and at first neither of us were really trying but then we got to talking more and we didn't really want to ever stop.'

She added: 'When I got home I told all my flatmates that I had met someone really special. 

'The next day we went down to the lake near campus and sat for about four hours doing nothing but talking. We went out together that night and it went perfectly.'

The couple spent nearly every day together before they took a trip to Istanbul, where Kate is from, in January.

It was there that computer science student James, from Berkshire, popped the question at 1am on 3 January - three months after they had met.

Kate said yes and admitted she struggled to hold back the tears during the romantic moment. 

The couple clearly like to joke around with one another as Kate wore this T-shirt which reads 'Property of James' and includes arrows pointing to her breasts 

James and Kate got engaged on the 5th of January and announced it on Facebook, pictured, but don't plan to marry until they graduate

The couple have announced their engagement on Facebook and admitted it did come as a surprise to their parents.

Kate said: 'Our friends are not surprised and our parents are over the moon but at first they found it a bit weird but they knew straight away things were different between us.'

She said they are not bothered about people who may criticise them for getting engaged so soon into their relationship as she says people can't judge them if they don't know them.

She added that 'the ring and the engagement are symbolic of our commitment to each other' but they do not have any plans to actually tie the knot for the foreseeable future.

They don't intend to marry until after they have both graduated and Kate said they have no plans to start a family till after then either.
