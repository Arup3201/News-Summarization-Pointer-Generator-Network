A bus carrying passengers has been rescued by a crane after it was engulfed by a huge crack which appeared suddenly in the road.

The bus sunk into the gaping pothole with 31 passengers on board near a construction site in Nanjing, in China's Jiangsu province today.

The passengers were evacuated and no one was injured in the sinkhole incident near the construction site for the city’s subway, it was reported.

Suddenly sunk: This bus, carrying 31 passengers, was engulfed in a huge pothole today in the city of Nanjing, east China

The Nanjing Metro Authority said initial investigations indicated that the movement of 'quicksand' underground could have caused the collapse.

As an emergency strategy, sand was poured into the hole to secure the underground structure, the authority said.

Evacuated: No one on board the bus was injured but nearby streets were closed

Building to blame: A crane was used to rescue the bus which sunk in the hole next to the construction site for the city's subway

Nearby streets were closed as people gathered to witness the unusual scene but the subway remained in service.

Due to the size of the vehicle, it only partly sunk unlike a minibus in the city of Guilin, in south China which was completely engulfed without warning in a 16ft-deep pit in June as it was driven along the Fuxing Road in the city’s Qixing district.

According to reports the pit, which was about 13ft long and 8ft wide, came after heavy rains weakened the eroded the road's asphalt surface.
