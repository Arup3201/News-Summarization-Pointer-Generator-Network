Damage to the British economy from trade sanctions against Russia would be a 'price worth paying', William Hague said yesterday.

Travel bans and asset freezes against Moscow's 'bullying' behaviour towards Ukraine were planned, the Foreign Secretary said.

America has admitted that the sanctions will have more impact on the EU than on the US – Europe buys much of its gas from Russia – and many fear London, where Russian oligarchs have invested billions, will suffer.

Foreign Secretary William Hague has said travel bans and asset freezes against Moscow's 'bullying' behaviour towards Ukraine were planned

Mr Hague said that despite this 'more far-reaching measures' were being prepared that would have a fundamental impact.

He told Sky's Murnaghan programme: 'It would be a price worth paying if this situation continues to deteriorate... history teaches us that we have to stand up to such bullying behaviour from one state on to another.'

Any fresh sanctions made against Russia will be targeted to hurt those closest to Vladimir Putin and to have a significant impact on the Russian economy.

Those expected to be penalised include the companies controlled by the Russian President's inner circle and the Russian defence industry.

David Cameron has suggested that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich could be hit by sanctions because of his association with Mr Putin.

Alex Salmond says he admires Vladimir Putin – despite the Russian President’s crackdown on Ukrainian sovereignty.

Scotland’s First Minister said Mr Putin had restored a ‘substantial part of Russian pride’.

His remarks to a magazine were made on March 14, just two weeks before Russian soldiers annexed Crimea.

Praising ‘certain aspects’ of Mr Putin, Mr Salmond added: ‘You can see why he carries support in Russia.’

Patricia Ferguson, Scottish Labour’s external affairs spokesman, said the comments were ‘insensitive and ill-judged’.

Last night neither Downing Street nor the Foreign Office would be drawn on who could be on the latest sanctions list, ahead of talks today.

In Washington, Republicans have called for the West to send 'shockwaves' by hitting Gazprom and Russian banks with sanctions. Financial markets have plummeted by more than a fifth in Russia since the start of the year, with the value of the rouble at an all-time low.

President Barack Obama said that Mr Putin would be deterred from further aggressive acts in Ukraine if he saw the world was unified in punishing Moscow.

He accused Mr Putin of failing to lift a finger to persuade pro-Russian militants to comply with the  Geneva deal intended to defuse  the situation.

One of a team of European monitors seized by pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine was freed last night. The man – believed to be Swedish – was released on medical grounds.

He was one of eight monitors detained in Sloviansk on Friday accused of being Nato spies.

Three bloodied and blindfolded Ukrainian men accused by separatists of being spies were allowed to be filmed. They were caught while on a mission to detain a Russian suspected of killing a Ukrainian MP.

Pro-Russian armed groups seized the main TV and radio station in Donetsk yesterday.
