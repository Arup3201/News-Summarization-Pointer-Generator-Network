Americans were united in their grief last night as they attended vigils to remember the 26 victims of the Sandy Hook shooting.

Many people lit candles as they stood in the dark clutching candles while silently reflecting on the tragic events of last Friday.

Paper lanterns were released into the night sky during a vigil in Omaha, Nebraska.

Last night hundreds of people huddled in a miserable drizzle as they waited in line at Newtown High School to see President Barack Obama preside over an interfaith worship vigil.

Families lined up started as early as 3.30pm or 4pm, even though President Obama did not take the stage until shortly before 8pm.

Several members of the audience clutched red cross blankets around their shoulders as they huddled together, many of them breaking down in tears throughout the service.

The same blankets were handed out while the attendees waited in the long line that wrapped around the building and snaked through the parking lot before heading inside to get settled for the service.

You are not alone in your grief. Our world too has been torn apart,' President Obama said.

'All across this land our world too 
has been torn apart. All across this land we wept with you and pulled 
our children tight. Newtown, you are not alone.'

In one of the most religious speeches
of his presidency, Mr Obama talked about how the ultimate goal for a 
society is to protect their children.

'If we don't get that right, we don't
get anything right. By that measure, can we truly say as a nation that 
we are doing our obligations?' he said.

A particularly poignant moment came 
in the speech when Mr Obama read the first names of all 20 children who 
died in the shooting.

'We can't accept events like this as 
routine. Are we really prepared to say that we're powerless in the face 
of such carnage?' he said, referring to the four other mass shootings 
that have taken place since Mr Obama was elected.

Deep sobs and sniffles filled the 
room throughout the service - but tears did not truly begin until Jason 
Graves took the podium to offer a Muslim prayer on behalf of the Al 
Hedeya Islamic Center of Newtown.

Mr Graves' voice choked and crackled as he assured the mourners that God's love was there for anyone asked for it.

Adults and children sitting in the 
audience, who initially turned their faces away as a prayer was recited 
in Arabic, were reduced to deep sorrowful cries.

Just three days after the young 
children were gunned down in their classrooms, a half-dozen of their 
bodies are now being prepared for coffins as the first funerals will be 
held today.

The first funeral today is that of Noah Pozner, the youngest of the 16 six-year-old victims.

The funeral for his friend Jack Pinto
will be held at the same time at a Newtown facility, and a wake will be
held for James Mattioli, also 6-years-old, later this afternoon.

James and fellow Catholic student 
Jessica Rekos will both have funeral services at St. Rose  of Lima 
Church on Tuesday, and Rachel D'Avino is going to be buried in 
neighboring Watertown that same day.

The first adult victim's funeral will
take place on Wednesday when the 27-year-old heroic teacher Victoria 
Soto has her service. Student Daniel Barden will have his funeral on the
same day.

Those are just six of the 20 funerals
for the student victims that the town's clergy need to coordinate and 
host in the coming week, a task so daunting that 100 funeral directors 
from across the state have volunteered to help the process.

Some have donated use of their 
hearses and time, while coffin manufacturers have given 
heart-wrenchingly small child-sized caskets for the victims.

Warmth in cold times: The Red Cross provided blankets for attendees to wrap around themselves and stuffed animals for many of the children who were in the audience
