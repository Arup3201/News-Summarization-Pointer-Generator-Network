Two Maryland men have been arrested after allegedly stealing the car of woman in labor at gunpoint as she and her boyfriend were trying to get to hospital.

Devery Kelley, 24, and Cornell Robinson, 44, were apprehended by police in Annapolis after they ditched the stolen car and attempted to flee on foot in the early hours of Sunday morning.

A third man is believed to have escaped in an unidentified car.

The woman was transported to Anne Arundel Medical Center but it is not known if she has delivered her baby.

A witness called 911 after seeing two people being held up in the 1800 block of Copeland St at 4:30am.

The men were armed with two shotguns and a handgun.

The Baltimore Sun reports that one of the men told the pregnant woman, 'Open the door. Go get the money. Do you want to die? Do you think we playing?'

The woman told police that the men kept asking: 'Where's the key?'

She handed it over and Kelley and Robinson fled in the vehicle as police arrived on the scene.

WBAL-TV reports that they threw a handgun out the window during the chase which has since been recovered.

The pair ditched the car and attempted to escape on foot but were caught by police after a brief chase.

Kelley is being held at the Jennifer Road Detention Center on $275,000 bond and Robinson is being held without bond.
