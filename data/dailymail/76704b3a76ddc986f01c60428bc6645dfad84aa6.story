A new cardboard wine bottle has been created by a Californian-based team that is made from compressed recycled cardboard with a plastic liner inside.

PaperBoy is the brainchild of packaging company Ecologic Brands and Truett-Hurst winery, and claims the carbon footprint of their 'molded pulp' bottles is 67 per cent smaller than that of its glass cousins, and weighs a whopping 85 per cent less.

'Campers, hikers, and fishermen can carry this lightweight package and enjoy premium wine from a 750-mL bottle almost anywhere,' CEO Phil Hurst explains in a statement to Fastco Design.

Booze it up while saving the planet! Eco-friendly PaperBoy wine is packaged in compressed recycled cardboard, and is 85 per cent lighter than glass bottles

'From mountaintops to impromptu pool parties. Heck, even the final frontier - space,' PaperBoy's website reads.

Mr Hurst adds that the bottle is also collapsible, so it can easily be retained and returned to a recycling site following use.

And while you are right in thinking that glass wine bottles are recyclable too, they only actually end up in recycling plants 28 per cent of the time, compared to paper, which has a 91 per cent recycling rate.

Sleek design: 'From mountaintops to impromptu pool parties', PaperBoy wine is fully collapsible after use, so can be easily recycled

Ready to go! Although glass bottles are recyclable, they only end up in recycling plants 28 per cent of the time, compared to paper, which has a 91 per cent recycling rate

And there's more. Mr Hurst says that if the 207 million cases of wines shipped around the country each year were packaged in the light-weight PaperBoy bottle, it would save roughly 50 million gallons of diesel and 560,000 tons of CO2.

The concept was originally dreamed up up by London-based designer Kevin Shaw, at packaging firm Stranger & Stranger. Mr Shaw coined the name and the Twenties-era styled cartoon design.

'How to save the planet with a paper bottle!' the label reads.

Now that's something we can all drink to.

PaperBoy is available in 44 states and sells a 2012 Paso Robles Red Blend and a 2012 Mendocino Chardonnay, both $14.99.
