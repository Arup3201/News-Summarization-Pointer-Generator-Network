A glamour model who has struck up a relationship with a married professional rugby league player has defended herself after receiving a barrage of abuse from Twitter users.

Irate people have inundated Holly Henderson with abusive Tweets after reports that she has begun a relationship with Warrington Wolves prop Paul Wood.

The athlete, who famously lost a testicle during a match earlier this year has reportedly left his wife and two children for Miss Henderson, who used to date Manchester City footballer Mario Balotelli.

Paul is reported to have left his wife of six years and two children to be with Holly, who says she has no bad feeling towards Shelley

The pair were spotted shopping on New Years Eve in Wigan after he had collected his belongings from the family home.

The 34-year-old was seen getting into the 
car of her new man after he appeared to move out of the house he shared 
with his young family.

The 
31-year-old was said to have told his wife of six years Shelley that he 
was leaving her on the day after Boxing Day, it was reported in The Sun.

Holly, whose real name is Jeanette Worthington, received comments that are too obscene for the Mail Online to publish, and says she will contact police if threats against her continue.

One accused her of being a being a 'filthy home-wrecker' and another of her looking like a 'rough scrubber'.

She said: 'I'm truly disgusted at the reaction from members of the public on my twitter feed.

'Couples break up all the time, just because we have different jobs, people think they have the right to send vile uneducated tweets.

'I have no bad feelings towards Shelley Wood, and wish that people would just leave us to be happy. 

'I
have received threats from the 'Rugby wives' banning me from 'match 
days' and threats of violence if the abuse continues I will be 
contacting my legal team and the police.'

Mrs Wood is believed to have been in tears as he left after visiting their children - George, four, and Darcey, 20 months - on Saturday.

A family friend told The Sun: ‘How Paul could walk away from his wife and two kids at Christmas is staggering.

‘No one can believe he’s left the woman he’s loved for so long for a porn star.'

Wood said his marriage ended before he started seeing Miss Henderson, 34, and did not leave his wife for the glamour model. But he declined to say when he started seeing her.

He has not yet responded to comment from MailOnline for a request to comment.

Dating: The pair got together two months ago while he was recovering from his horrific injury and have been seen in bars in Stockton Heath in Warrington, Cheshire, according to The Sun

Tight-lipped: Miss Henderson, pictured on her Twitter account, confirmed today that she was 'romantically linked' to the Warrington Wolves prop

Glamour model: Mother-of-two Miss Henderson has appeared on porn channel Bluebird TV and starred in Channel 4 reality show Sex, Lies and Rinsing Guys

The rugby star suffered a ruptured 
testicle after being kneed in the groin by Leeds Rhino player Kallum 
Watkins during the Super League Grand Final in October.

Remarkably, he played on for 40 minutes before calmly heading off to hospital to have it surgically removed.

The Sun claims Wood met up with Holly, a mother-of-two who has appeared on porn channel Bluebird TV, after flirting on Twitter.

They
got together two months ago while he was recovering from his horrific 
injury and have been seen in bars in Stockton Heath in Warrington, 
Cheshire, according to the paper.

Miss
Henderson confirmed that she was 'romantically linked' to the 
Warrington Wolves pro.

On her Twitter account today, a user told her: 'love u to babe u n paul r lush love how happy u are x'

To which, she replied: 'only get 1 life ay x'. She told another poster: 'thanks hunny, we're happy xxx'.

Pain barrier: Wood 
carried on playing for 40minutes after being kneed in the groin during the Super League Grand Final (above) in October, an injury that meant he needed to have his testicle surgically removed

Finding fame: Miss Henderson, 34, has previously dated Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli (right)

Mrs Wood has also declined to comment.

Miss Henderson found fame after she started seeing Balotelli, 22, and went on to star on Channel 4 reality show Sex, Lies & Rinsing Guys, where glamorous girls use their charm, beauty and glamour to get ‘gifts’ from men.

She also claims to be related to Manchester United and England striker Wayne Rooney, but has not not elaborated on the family connection.

Speaking after the 26-18 defeat to Leeds at Old Trafford, Wood was able to see the funny side of his injury.

Referring to his team-mates, he previously said: ‘I know they’ll be taking the mickey.

‘Even when I was in hospital (on the night of the match) they were sending me texts saying: “You worked your b***s off tonight!” Lucky I’ve got a sense of humour.’
