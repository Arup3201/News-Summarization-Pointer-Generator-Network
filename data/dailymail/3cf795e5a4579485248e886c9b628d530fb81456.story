Oscar Pistorius yesterday appeared 
before a packed court and categorically denied murdering his model 
girlfriend, insisting he had been deeply in love with her.

The 26-year-old Blade Runner said he 
mistook Reeva Steenkamp for an intruder and shot her through the locked 
door of a toilet in his mansion home.

He said he thought she was in his bed 
when he opened fire. ‘I kicked the door open, I tried to help her but 
she died in my arms,’ he said in his first account of what happened on 
the night 29-year-old law graduate Miss Steenkamp died.

Account: Pistorius claimed he mistook his girlfriend for a burglar and is back in court today to argue for bail

Compeling: In a statement read out to Pretoria magistrates court, the Paralympic athlete said he had been on the balcony of his house when he heard noises from the bathroom

Decision: The judge said he will consider downgrading the charge but the news brought Pistorius to tears

Pistorius sobbed uncontrollably as 
Barry Roux, one of South Africa’s leading defence lawyers, read the 
athlete’s statement to Pretoria magistrate Desmond Nair, asking that he 
be allowed bail.

The hushed court also heard a 
statement from a close friend of Miss Steenkamp who said the model and 
law graduate had told her ‘she would marry Oscar Pistorius if he asked 
her. She said he was intense but she loved him’. He treated her ‘like 
gold’.

Prosecutor Gerrie Nel painted a very 
different version of the events in the early hours of Valentine’s Day. 
He said Pistorius had shot his cowering girlfriend in cold blood. ‘She 
couldn’t go anywhere,’ Mr Nel said. ‘It must have been horrific.’

Listening:  His brother and sister were in court today. The sportsman was accused of grabbing his gun and strapping on his prosthetic legs before walking seven metres and shooting dead the model

Difficult hearing: Oscar Pistorius's brother Carl Pistorius and sister Aimee arriving at the Pretoria Magistrate Court this morning before listening to the grim details

Mission: Her brother, Adam Steenkamp, said after the service: 'We're going to keep all the positive things that we remember and know about my sister and we will try and continue with the things that she tried to make better'

Statement: Pistorius said that he was 'deeply in love' with his girlfriend and that she had bought him a Valentine's Day present

As Pistorius's relatives supported him in court, the distraught family of Miss Steenkamp attended her funeral in Port Elizabeth.

Her brother Adam said that her death had 'left space missing inside all of the people that she knew.'

But there was also anger. Gavin Venter, an ex-jockey who worked for 
Reeva's father, called for the harshest of sentences for Pistorius.

In court the prosecutor told the bail hearing the couple 
had had a shouting match and Miss Steenkamp fled to the bathroom and 
locked herself in. She was an ‘unarmed, innocent woman’. But Mr Roux 
insisted there was no evidence to substantiate a murder charge. ‘There 
is no concession this is a murder,’ he said.

It was theme underlined by Pistorius 
in his affidavit. He said: ‘I fail to understand how I could be charged 
with murder, let alone premeditated murder because… I had no intention 
to kill my girlfriend.’

He said on the evening of February 13 they had decided to stay in and had gone to bed.

‘I’m acutely aware of people gaining 
entries to homes to commit crime, I’ve received death threats. I sleep 
with my 9mm under my bed.’ He said he heard a noise in the bathroom 
after getting up to close a sliding door. ‘I was scared and didn’t 
switch on the light.

Protesting: 'Rot in jail, was the message from women's groups outside the hearing

Tensions running high: Women protest outside the Pretoria Magistrates court, during the bail application hearing

Pistorius has applied to the central firearms registry as collector to these firearms.

Six applications are pending, but any charge of violent crime will make it unlikely that firearm licenses will be granted.

‘I got my gun and moved towards the 
bathroom. I screamed at the intruder because I did not have my legs on I
 felt vulnerable. I fired shots through the bathroom door and told Reeva
 to call police.

‘I walked back to the bed and realised
 Reeva was not in bed. It then it dawned on me it could be her in there.
 It filled me with horror and fear.’ He put on his prosthetic legs, 
tried to kick down the door, then bashed it in with a cricket bat to 
find Miss Steenkamp dying.

‘She died in my arms,’ he said. ‘I am absolutely mortified at the death of my beloved Reeva.’

As Mr Roux read the statement, 
Pistorius wept and Mr Nair halted proceedings for several minutes. ‘You 
need to concentrate on what’s going on,’ he told Pistorius. 

Statements from four friends were also
 read to the court which painted a picture of a ‘humble’ man who was 
considering building a future with Miss Steenkamp.

Mr Nair ruled that Pistorius should be
 charged with premeditated murder, a ‘category six’ offence that will 
make it very difficult for him to be granted bail.

Last night lawyers for Pistorius took 
the unusual step of releasing his full statement. Describing the moment 
he thought an intruder had broken in, the statement said: ‘I felt a 
sense of terror rushing over me. There are no bars across the bathroom 
window and I knew contractors had left ladders outside.’ The statement 
told how the toilet was in cubicle within the bathroom. ‘On my way to 
the bathroom I screamed words to the effect for him/them to get out of 
my house and for Reeva to phone the police. It was pitch dark.

‘I noticed that the bathroom window was open. I realised that the intruder was in the toilet.

‘I thought he or they must have 
entered through the unprotected window.’ He said he then opened fire 
believing his girlfriend was still in bed. The hearing was adjourned.

The BBC has apologised after the 9am bulletin on Radio 6 Music, featuring a report on Pistorius, was followed by a song about a man shooting his girlfriend – the Jimi Hendrix Experience version of Hey Joe.

The track includes the lines: ‘Hey Joe, where you going with that gun in your hand? I’m going out to shoot my old lady, you know I caught her messing around with another man.’
