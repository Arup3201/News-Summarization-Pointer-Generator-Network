Geraint Thomas has come out swinging in the wake of a report detailing that doping is still rife in the professional world of cycling, branding the findings as ‘insulting’.

The Team Sky rider was reacting to claims made in the Cycling Independent Reform Commission report, which was published on Monday.

In it one ‘respected cycling professional’ is said to believe that 90 per cent of the peloton are still benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs. 

Geraint Thomas has taken aim at CIRC's report into doping in elite cycling, branding the findings as insulting

The report alleges that the UCI acted favourably to Armstrong to protect the sport and that doping still takes place in the sport. However, unlike in Armstrong's days, its says riders now have a choice to dope or not

That, according to Thomas, is rubbish.

‘I think it’s a hell of a lot cleaner,’ he told the BBC. ‘I didn’t race back then, but some of the stories you hear… it’s certainly not like that now.

‘Whole teams were doing it back then.

‘It’s insulting when people say it [cycling] is really filthy and saying I’m doing something wrong. I dedicate everything to this.

‘You look at older riders – they are the most cynical about it all because they don’t know any other way.

‘Look at Brad [Wiggins] and [Chris] Froome. I’d put all the money I have on them being clean.’

Thomas said he'd bet that former Tour de France champion Chris Froome is a clean rider
