Upmarket BMW bucked the German trend and was fourth from bottom with its X1 small-car, followed by  the  Ford Ka,  Fiat Grande Punto / Punto Evo, Citroën C4,  the Smart Fortwo, Ford Fusion and  Citroën C1 in 100th place.

What Car? said of the worst-rated 109th-placed Chevrolet Spark: ‘Problems affect nearly every aspect of the car from its ventilation system to its engine.

The biggest complaints are aimed at the poor radio reception and a particularly cheap interior feel. Problems with the  gearbox and starting the engine have been reported too.’

The results are based on customer satisfaction ratings compiled this year among , more than 15,000 motorists based on models registered between January 2011 and December 2012.

Britain’s Jaguar and Japan’s Lexus equal took top honours among manufacturers  with Mercedes-Benz third, Skoda fourth and Volkswagen fifth. They were followed in the top ratings by Honda, Volvo, Toyota, Korean car-maker Kia, Mazda and Britain’s MINI.

Worst rated manufacturer was  Chevrolet  a budget  brand that is leaving Britain -  followed by  Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Suzuki,  Citroën and Renault.

Owners were asked to judge their vehicle on a number of criteria including vehicle appeal, upkeep costs and dealer service quality.

What Car? editor Jim Holder said: ‘The Volkswagen Group deserves special congratulations.

‘It is clearly building cars that have showroom appeal and, even more importantly, deliver in real life. Cars that perform in customer satisfaction surveys are a great recommendation for car buyers and act as a great barometer to a car's quality’.

The What Car?/JD Power study measures customer satisfaction is based on evaluation of numerous attributes grouped and marked against  in four key measures: vehicle appeal which includes performance, design, comfort and features (31 per cent); vehicle quality and reliability (22 per cent);  ownership costs which includes fuel consumption, insurance and costs of service/repair (25 per cent),; and dealer service satisfaction (22 per cent).
