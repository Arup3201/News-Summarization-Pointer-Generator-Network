Times are tough in the property market with prices tumbling everywhere - and the biggest house in America is no exception.

The 30-bedroom mansion in Windermere near Orlando, Florida, which is modelled after France's Palace of Versailles, has had its price slashed by $10million to $65million.

You might think for that money, you would be ready to move in at a moment's notice.

But the gaudy mansion is only two-thirds finished and there is an estimated $30million (£17million) of work still to do.

It is also now on offer in a completed state for $90million, down from the previous $100million asking price.

An
 unlikely victim of the economic downturn in America, it boasts its own 
bowling alley, roller skating rink and Olympic-sized swimming pool.

Owners
 David Siegel, 77, and his former beauty queen wife Jackie, 46, are the subjects of new 
documentary film Queen Of Versailles, which was to chronicle the 
building of the largest family home in the U.S.

However,
 the movie ends up showed how the economic downturn forced them to 
stop building their dream home, a sort-of Las Vegas version of a French 
chateau, for four years.

Construction on 
the 'palace', which many have described as the epitome of trashy bad 
taste, was brought to a halt in 2010 when the Siegels, who have eight 
children, first experienced the pangs of recession.

Self-made
 time-share mogul Mr Siegel brought work to a halt and put the property 
up for sale so he could reinvest the money in his business.

He has since claimed, earlier this year, that his business has recovered and work has now recommenced on the mansion.

Grand ambition: The gaudy mansion is only two-thirds finished and there is an estimated $30million of work left

Unfinished: The 120ft-long Grand Hall will be the centrepiece of the mansion

Artist's impression: When it is complete, the hall will feature two staircases and a massive central chandelier, hanging beneath a 30ft stained-glass dome

It
 should take two years to complete and, if the mansion remains on the 
market, the Siegel family will move in. They currently live in another 
giant home nearby.

Whether 
it will sell or not is another matter. Estate agents have previously 
said that there has already been interest from Russia and the Far East 
for the property in Windermere near Orlando, Florida.

As well as 30 bedrooms, the home will have 23 bathrooms with spectacular views over Lake Butler, about 20 miles outside Orlando.

All
 23 full bathrooms will have full-sized hot tubs, and 160 triple-pane 
windows and Brazilian mahogany French-style doors promise plenty of 
light.

The hand-built windows for the house cost more than £2million and other luxuries included a ballroom and children's theatre.

No expense has been spared on the construction, with materials flown in from around the world

Elegant: This stained-glass dome promises to transfix the mansion's occupants on sunny days

Breakfast bar: One of the mansion's smaller 11 kitchens

Living large: Mr Siegel doesn't do things by halves. Here he is with a lion friend

Jet-setting: The family travel en masse in one of Mr Siegel's private planes

There
 are three swimming pools, a large boat house, formal gardens, a 
one-storey gatehouse with an apartment - and an underground garage with 
enough space for 20 cars.

There
 is also: a baseball field; two tennis courts; a 60ft by 120ft Grand 
Hall with a 30ft stained glass dome; two grand staircases; a 37ft by 
30ft 'master' kitchen; ten satellite kitchens, a two-storey wine cellar;
 and a rock grotto with three separate spas behind an 80ft waterfall.

There is also a His and Her office space with a 12ft two-sided aquarium.

The property was called Versailles as the entrance was modelled after the Palace of Versailles in France.

Mrs
 Siegel,  who won the Miss Florida beauty title in the 1990s, is well 
known on the social circuit in the state. She has a team of nannies to 
help her look after her children, aged from six to 17.

'Fixer-upper opportunity': With 30 bedrooms, three swimming pools, 11 kitchens and 90,000 sq ft of floor space, you probably won't even notice that there is still major construction work going on

Upstairs: The upper level has the lion's share of the bedrooms, as well as the children's theatre

Floorplan: The main level has offices, a media room, the Grand Hall, pool deck and outdoor 'summer kitchen'

Downstairs: The lower level has a 20-car garage, skating rink, bowling alley, games arcade and indoor pool
