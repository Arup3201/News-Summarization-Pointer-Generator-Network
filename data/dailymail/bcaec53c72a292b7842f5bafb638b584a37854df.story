Lukasz Fabianski has promised Swansea City will recover from their worst home defeat in 24 years against a Chelsea side he expects to win the Barclays Premier League title.

Polish goalkeeper Fabianski was a helpless spectator as leaders Chelsea underlined their title credentials with a 5-0 victory at the Liberty Stadium on Saturday - Swansea's heaviest home defeat since a 6-1 loss to Wigan Athletic in April 1991.

'We have to bounce back, there is no other way.' Fabianski said.

'We did not give ourselves a chance. Games like that are a motivation for the next one and we have to use it.

'We all know we were very poor and that should give us motivation to prepare ourselves for the next one.'

Fabianski was beaten inside the first minute by Oscar's 20-yard shot and things got quickly worse for Swansea as Chelsea were 4-0 ahead by half-time, with the Brazilian midfielder and Spanish striker Diego Costa both scoring twice before substitute Andre Schurrle added a late fifth.

'We put ourselves in a very difficult position against a great team,' said the former Arsenal goalkeeper.

'After that first goal it felt like we lost the focus on the game plan and let Chelsea dominate and take advantage of the mistakes we made.

'Obviously it is difficult when every five minutes you see players coming at you at full speed and sometimes you think 'what is happening?'

'That has not been happening this season, even in the game we played away at Chelsea.

'We have been solid but right from the first minute here it was weird and strange.

'But hopefully we can come to some smart conclusions because we owe it to the fans as they were fantastic, even though we were struggling.'

Swansea were severely weakened by the absence of key midfielders Leon Britton, Jonjo Shelvey and Ki Sung-yueng - a point that Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was quick to highlight after the game - on the back of top scorer Wilfried Bony's midweek departure to Manchester City.

However, there was no denying Chelsea's brilliance on a day when every player was at the top of his game and Fabianski believes they are the best team in England right now.

'If I am completely honest, comparing them to Manchester City who are up there with them, I think they are stronger,' Fabianski said.

'Their attacking force is something really different, they are very sharp, quick and technical.

'They are always trying to surprise you, they make great runs and are always in good positions.

'After the last goal when they were playing around our box, I looked back and there were three players already celebrating with Schurrle and I could not believe how quickly they had got to him in our six-yard box.

'It was because they were all in there. So from a physical and technical point of view they are very, very strong.'
