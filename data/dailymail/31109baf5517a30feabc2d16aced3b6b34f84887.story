Liverpool striker Fabio Borini could be on his way back to Italy, after reports in his homeland confirmed AC Milan have made enquiries about the striker. 

According to Gazzetta dello Sport,  Milan have made contact with the Reds over a possible loan deal for the 23-year-old.

The Rossoneri are in need of a striker after selling Mario Balotelli to Liverpool for £16million on Monday.

Return to Wearside? Borini spent last seaon on loan at Sunderland but is unsure about a permanent deal

Milan's approach for Borini will  interest Sunderland, who have been linked with the striker throughout the summer, after he spent last season on loan at the club.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has been frustrated by the delay on the deal's completion however, and said on Monday: ‘I think we’re getting close to a final decision either way because it’s been a bit too long.

Promise: Borini scored 10 times while on loan at Sunderland, and has attracted interest from AC Milan

Alternative? Milan have approached Chelsea about Fernando Torres, but Borini would be a cheaper option

‘It’s time now that it’s a yes coming or a no as we need to move on.’ 

A loan deal is reportedly Borini's preference, which may mean he opts for AC Milan rather than a permanent move to Sunderland.

A deal for Borini to Milan could also have implications on the Italian side's interest in Chelsea striker Fernando Torres. 

Milan have been in talks with Chelsea over a loan move for the Spaniard, but Gazzetta dello Sport claims the Italians see Borini as a cheaper alternative to Torres.
