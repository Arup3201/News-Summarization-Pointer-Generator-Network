Aids campaigners, including actor Bill Nighy, have urged world leaders to follow the UK Government's lead and continue to help fund worldwide treatment for the disease.

On the eve of World Aids Day, aid agency Oxfam has issued a stark warning that nearly seven million HIV sufferers around the globe are at risk due to a lack of funding to pay for their treatment.

The charity has released video footage of ambassador Nighy visiting Malawi to highlight the plight of almost one million people living with the disease in one of the poorest countries in the world.

A massive £1billion shortfall in the Global Fund to fight aids, TB and malaria has been left by international donors leaving nearly half of HIV sufferers in poverty-stricken countries - includingan estimated 1.4million children - without access to Antiretroviral therapy (ARV).

Around 650,000 people in Malawi alone are going without the treatment - which costs just 23 pence per day to provide - with only enough funding to provide a third of sufferers with free treatment.

The aid agency fears that the funding shortfall risks undermining the significant progress which has been made to halt the number of new infections worldwide, because people with HIV not taking ARVs are more likely to transmit the disease to others.

Nighy said: 'So many people aren’t getting the medicines they need through no fault of their own, simply because they drew the short straw geographically. I met people who had been literally rescued from death by medicines which cost only 23 pence a day.

Criticism: The actor hit out at 'armchair cynics' who disagree with funding AIDS treatment

'I choose not to listen to the armchair cynics, whose philosophical opposition to aid bewilders me.

'I choose to listen to Mara Banda, a lady I met in Malawi who is living with the HIV virus, who told me quietly and simply that she would be dead if it were not for medicines paid for by our aid.'

Ahead of the Chancellor’s Autumn statement on Wednesday, Oxfam has welcomed the UK government’s commitment to meet its aid promises and is urging it to encourage other international donors to do so.

Oxfam Chief Executive, Barbara Stocking, said: 'It is heartbreaking that seven million lives are still on the line today, when world leaders promised that they would ensure everyone in the world would have access to HIV prevention, care and treatment by 2010.  

'UK aid is helping to improve healthcare in countries like Malawi, but there is still a very long way to go and millions of lives globally are still at risk.

'Now more than ever it’s crucial that international donors follow the UK’s lead and increase their commitments to aid, which for many really does mean the difference between life and death.'
