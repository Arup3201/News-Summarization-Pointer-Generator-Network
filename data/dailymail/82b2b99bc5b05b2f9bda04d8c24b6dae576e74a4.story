Metereologists call it a a 'bombogenesis' - a mid-latitude cyclone whose surface barometric pressure drops by 24 or more millibars in a 24-hour period.

But the easiest way for the rest of the us to understand it is as winter bomb, and one that is headed for the northeast U.S. from early next week, despite the calendar saying it's spring.

Experts say to prepare for a wintry mix of rain and snow from the Carolinas to Maine and into Canada as a mass of cold Arctic air descends over the Northeast and East Coast.

Models suggest the storm will rapidly intensify Tuesday night and Wednesday, qualifying as as an 'explosive development' or bombgenesis.

According to Alex Sosnowski, a senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, the storm is moving from the Gulf of Alaska and will travel southeastward into British Columbia and the northern Rockies over the weekend. 

On the move: The winter 'bomb', descending south from Canada, is expected to turn eastward early next week, dropping spotty snow, rain and a wintry mix over the central states

The snowstorm already hit Montreal on Saturday. A low pressure system in the area is moving rapidly eastward toward Maine

On Tuesday the storm is expected to either slam or shoulder New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England. 

Residents of these areas can expect strong winds and windswept snow Tuesday night and Wednesday.

Coastal cities should look out for possible flooding with high tide Wednesday morning.

'The storm will spin up as eastbound disturbances from the Midwest and the Gulf of Mexico interact over the East Coast and Western Atlantic,' according to Weather.com. 

'These disturbances, initially relatively weak, are expected to merge into a much more powerful low-pressure system just off the East Coast.'

The storm may then either slam or graze New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, New York and New England with windswept snow and strong winds Tuesday night through Wednesday

Initially meteorologists said up to six inches of snow could fall, but with the way the storm is moving it is hard to tell.

The storm hit Montreal on Saturday and contined to move south toward Maine on Sunday.

Experts said the weather patters seemed more January than they did March.

Hopefully, they say, it is the last blast of winter for this half of 2014.

The snow and big freeze will be accompanied by strong winds that could lead to coastal flooding.

As well as creating treacherous driving conditions, the late-season storm is likely to create other hazards.

'Where heavy wet snow falls on areas where trees are budding and blossoming in the South, there is a greater risk of downed tree limbs and power outages with the storm,' AccuWeather's chief operating officer Evan Myers said.
