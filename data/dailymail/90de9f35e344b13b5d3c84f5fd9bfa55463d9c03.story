Luckily for fullback Derrick Coleman of the Seattle Seahawks he got his missing Super Bowl ring back despite leaving it in the back of his rental car.

NFL agent David Mulugheta, who rented the car next, found Coleman's ring after his wife noticed a Tiffany's box under the seat of the vehicle.

'Driving around in my @Enterprise rental car today & my wife looks under the seat & finds @DC2forlife Super Bowl Ring,' tweeted David Mulgheta.

Lucky find: David Mulugheta found this Super Bowl ring in the back of his new rental car and tweeted this image along with a message to Seattle Seahawks player Derrick Coleman

Legally deaf: Derrick Coleman of the Seattle Seahawks is the first legally deaf player ever in the NFL 

Mulugheta is an agent for one of Coleman's teammates Earl Thomas and he promised he'd give it to Thomas to return it to Coleman.

‘@DavidMulugheta you my hero' that's what's happens when you show kids the ring then hide it in your car!' wrote a very thankful Coleman.

Coleman was showing the ring to his children who hid his prized possession under the back seat.

'@DC2forlife no problem. Happy to be able to return it to you. #GotsToBeMoCareful,' responded Mulugheta.

Derrick Coleman has been in the spotlight before outside of his game and that's because he’s the first legally deaf offensive player in the NFL.

Hero for the day: Derrick Coleman thanked Mulugheta for finding his Super Bowl ring and says he left it when he passed it to the back seat to show to his kids 

Messenger: Mulugheta is the NFL agent for player Earl Thomas and he promised to give the ring to him so that he could return it to Coleman
