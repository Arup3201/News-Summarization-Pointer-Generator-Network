Former Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood has hit out at a section of fans campaigning for current boss Arsene Wenger to be sacked.

Despite earning a hard-fought victory against West Brom on Saturday, travelling fans displayed a banner which read, 'Arsene, thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye'.

The Arsenal fans may have grown tired of watching their side battle for fourth place each season, but the man who appointed Wenger 18 years ago believes calls for the Frenchman to be sacked are 'ridiculous'.

Hill-Wood told the Daily Star: 'Thoroughly ignorant people seem to have a say nowadays.

'It is a few hotheads jumping up and down thinking they are being clever.

'It is the most ridiculous way to behave really because normal people are forever saying boards act too hastily when they get rid of a manager.'

Hill-Wood believes Arsenal fans shouldn't be calling for Wenger to be sacked

Despite a slow start to the 2014-15 Premier League campaign, the Gunners still find themselves within two points of fourth spot, but the Emirates faithful will argue that playing for a Champions League place isn't enough.

Hill-Wood added: 'Here we have a really good one with the team sixth in the league and into the last 16 of the Champions League for the 15th consecutive season

'I don't take too much notice of it and it isn't going to influence the board, I am sure of that.'

Hill-Wood appointed Wenger as Gunners boss 18 years ago and was the club's chairman for 31 years
