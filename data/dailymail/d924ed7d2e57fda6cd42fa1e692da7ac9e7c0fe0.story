Victoria's Secret has released behind-the-scenes footage of its rigorous fashion show casting process, two weeks after it announced the models for this year's upcoming spectacle.

A succession of lithe hopefuls are seen strutting their stuff clad in skimpy black underwear and sky-high heels, having trained for months ahead of their '30-second' chance to impress the New York-based casting directors.

'Every year it gets more competitive,' says Victoria's Secret's chief marketing officer Ed Razek. 'They're all working out, so many of them are boxing, so many of them are doing Pilates.'

Pick me: Victoria's Secret has released behind-the-scenes footage of its rigorous casting process (pictured) ahead of its December 2, fashion show, which will take place in London

Speaking about what it takes for a fashion model to become a Victoria's Secret runway girl, the show's executive producer Monica Mitro says: 'We're looking for well-proportioned, beautiful skin, great personality, which is quite unique and rare.'

Sophia Neophitou, the show's head stylist, looks for someone 'captivating' and 'memorable,' while casting director John Pfeiffer is seeking to be 'inspired.'

It's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes some of the gazelle-like auditionees rise above the rest, but a vivacious energy seems to be paramount.

Model Blanca Padilla, who ended up being selected to walk the show, certainly has the recipe down, remarking: 'Victoria's Secret is all about the power of a woman, about attitude, about feeling confident, about feeling sexy, about feeling beautiful.'

And she certainly wasn't the only one exuding confidence and beauty at the casting call.

'It's going to be hard to do the edit because I've never put so many A's on a page before,' Mr Razek says.

Full package: Producer Ms Mitro explains, 'We're looking for well-proportioned, beautiful skin, great personality, which is quite unique and rare'

Beaming: It's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes some of the gazelle-like auditionees rise above the rest, but a vivacious energy seems to be paramount

Personality: Stylist Ms Neophitou looks for someone 'captivating' and 'memorable,' while casting director Mr Pfeiffer is seeking to be 'inspired'

Stripped down: All the models wear the same skimpy black uniform 

Among their few criticisms, the judges turned girls down who were 'too serious,' 'too petite' and 'too fast.'

Model Bridget Malcolm explained: 'It's such a hard process to get in. It's not only the casting.

'You're working out for months before, training hard and eating right. It's a combination of a LOT of work.'

Agent Heather Hughes of Women Management preps her models for the casting call every year, and says: 'To walk in the Victoria's Secret Show is the most competitive. You cannot compare it to anything else.'

High-standard: Mr Razek noted, 'It's going to be hard to do the edit because I've never put so many A's on a page before'

Dig my jig? Ms Braga goes that extra mile to entertain the judges with an impromptu Samba dance

Say cheese: Smiling from ear-to-ear is a prerequisite at the Victoria's Secret auditions. Pictured (left) a model who failed to make the cut and (right) Maud Welzen, who was selected

Not this time: Among their few criticisms, the judges turned girls down who were 'too serious,' 'too petite' and 'too fast'

Time is of the essence: The girls have, on average, only a 30-second slot to prove themselves 

Big deal: The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show castings are world-renowned as the most competitive in the whole fashion industry

One model who stood out, and not just for her beauty credentials, was Grace Mahary, who was praised for being fully 'invested' in the job and for turning up for the casting two minutes early.

Ms Mahary also made it through and will walk the show next month, along with blonde stunner Romee Strijd and Brazilian beauty Daniela Braga, who all feature in the casting footage.

Notable models who did appear in the casting footage but who didn't make the cut include Hilary Rhoda and Jessica Stam.

As for winged Angels who will take center stage at the show, the line-up includes Adriana Lima , Karlie Kloss, Alessandra Ambrosio, Lindsay Ellingson, Behati Prinsloo, Candice Swanepoel, Douzten Kroes and Lily Aldridge.

According to Vogue, this year's show will open in a blaze of gold as the models take to the runway for the 'Gilded Angels' section.

Set to the sound of Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Hozier and Ed Sheeran performing live, other sections of the show will be based on fairy tales - which will see the eight official Angels and 19 other girls becoming pixies and other mystical creatures.

Meanwhile an 'Exotic Traveller' section will be inspired by 'Mongolian, Asian and Indian' styles and a 'Dream Girls' theme will be based on the quintessential fifties pin-up look.

Rounding off the show will be a fun urban section showcasing Victoria's Secret offshoot 'Pink' which is aimed at younger women, and finally a black and white grand finale titled the 'Angel's Ball'.

The show, which attracts millions of viewers and a celebrity packed audience every year, is to be held in London for the very first time.
