Fernando Torres has likened his struggles during his time at Chelsea as to 'swimming with wet clothes on'.

The striker had a torrid time at Stamford Bridge following his £50million move from Liverpool, scoring just 20 Premier League goals over three-and-a-half years before being sent out on loan to AC Milan last summer.

Torres failed to impress at the San Siro and, after the Italian club bought him outright, they loaned him to Atletico Madrid where he is yet to score in nine La Liga appearances, though he has scored three in four Copa del Rey matches.

The Spain international told El Pais: 'The worst part of not playing is when you think you're prepared and ready to do it. I tried to get minutes at Chelsea and seize opportunities, but things do not always go the best way, and can drag on for weeks or even years.'

Torres added: 'It was like swimming with wet clothes on. Now I know how I am, and I'm fine. At the end those doubts about your quality eventually disappear.' 

Atletico, who reached the last eight of the Champions League after beating Bayer Leverkusen on penalties, are currently fourth in La Liga with 56 points from 27 games, nine behind the pace of table-toppers Barcelona.

Now, on loan back at his first professional club Atletico, Torres feels he has regained some of his confidence
