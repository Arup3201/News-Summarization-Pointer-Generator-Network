Defiant congressional Republicans attacked President Barack Obama's agenda from all sides Tuesday, ignoring the five veto threats he has issued in a week's time and pushing bills to uproot his policy agenda.

Immigration, Wall Street, the Canada-to-Texas Keystone XL oil pipeline and a sweeping reboot of how the White House enacts costly regulations are all on the chopping block, and the president's insistence on his way has some in the GOP steamed.

'I'm a member of Congress; I'm not a potted plant. I don't take my orders from the White House,' Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Charlie Dent told the Associated Press after GOP members met behind closed doors to discuss their strategy.

'There's a new sheriff in the Senate, and so he's not going to have a compliant majority leader in the Senate who's going to bottle up and bury everything,' Dent said.

That was a nod to new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Republicans had complained in the first six years of the Obama presidency that former leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, frequently refused to bring any bill to a vote if the White House opposed it.  

Obama invited his antagonists to the White House for their first face-to-face meeting since the new Republican-controlled Congress convened.

But their show of cordiality for the cameras did little to mask the partisan hostilities between Capitol Hill and the White House.

'The key now is for us to work as a team,' said Obama, despite his prolific veto warnings. 

He cited taxes, trade and cybersecurity as areas for potential cooperation.

Back at the Capitol, the Senate debated legislation to force Obama's administration to green-light the Keystone project, and the House moved toward a vote late Tuesday on a regulatory reform bill that the White House says would impose 'unprecedented and unnecessary' requirements on agencies trying to write rules.

It would require more justifications and notice, particularly for regulations that would cost the treasury millions of dollars.

That may be followed Wednesday by votes on two other bills.

One would alter a key section of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in a way that would help banks; the other would block Obama's executive actions on immigration, including removal of protections for immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children.

The Keystone bill passed the House last week and is expected to clear the Senate next week and head to Obama's desk.

Vetoes almost surely await, although the White House's official policy statements are couched in language that guarantees only that the president's aides will recommend he reject the legislation.

Far from cowed, with the Senate in GOP hands for the first time in eight years Republican lawmakers are ready to make him uncap that veto pen.

COOPERATION: White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest's role this week is to promote the talking point that the president has his arms open and is willing to work with Republicans

WORK AS A TEAM? Obama charmed legislators on Tuesday but did little to assuage Republicans' suspicion that he's playing political games

While the president mouthed words of cooperation, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest openly criticized Republican lawmakers during a daily press briefing, painting Obama as the only non-obstructionist with any meaningful power in Washington. 

The GOP's approach to the opening days of the new Congress, Earnest told reporters, raises questions 'about how serious they are about trying to work with the president.'

'In the first five days that they've been in session, they've advanced five pieces of legislation all the way to the Rules Committee that they already know this president strongly opposes,' he said.

Republicans have no plans to stop there.

Citing the terrorist attacks in Paris, GOP senators proposed on Tuesday to restrict how Obama can transfer terror suspects out of the federal prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, for the remainder of his term.

That move would make it far more difficult for him to fulfill his 2007 campaign promise to close the facility.

They seem intent on forcing Obama to uncap his veto pen and take a stand on issues where they perceive the public is on their side
