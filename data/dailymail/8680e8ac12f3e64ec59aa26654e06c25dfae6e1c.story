The city of Chicago claims to be dealing with a feathery problem by deporting scores of pigeons to Indiana.

Social worker Steffeny Smith told CBS Chicago how she witnessed two men netting a group of around 70 birds from her office window last Friday.

The catchers told Smith they were taking the pigeons to a farm in Indiana, a claim which has been confirmed by a local politician. But no further details are forthcoming.

Chicago social worker Steffeny Smith was disturbed by what she witnessed from her office window. Two men trapped 70 pigeons in a large net and then told her they were taking them to Indiana

Smith was shocked and disturbed by what she saw in the Uptown neighborhood of the city, as the trapped birds were clearly in distress.

The woman told CBS: 'I threw the window open because I was really triggered by it, it was just so horrifying.

'You could hear the pigeons crying. They were like smashed into the ground,' Smith added. But when she went down to question the men she was surprised by their answer.

'He said they're carrying them off to Indiana,' Smith explains. 'You've got to be kidding me. You really are telling me that I'm supposed to believe that? Like, really?,' she explained with large degree of skepticism.

Pigeons have long been a nuisance to the residents of Chicago

Chicago Alderman James Cappleman verified the claim that the pigeons were being relocated. 'An Indiana farmer contacted us and offered to capture and take pigeons to his farm. He wanted them alive,' said the statement from his office

Despite Smith's disbelief, the pigeon 'relocation' was backed up by a local politician.

James Cappleman, Aldermann for Chicago's 46th ward, has already expressed his wish to remove some of the birds from the city's streets.

In May 2012, he was assaulted by a local resident known as 'Pigeon Lady' when he tried to sweep away the breadcrumbs she had left for the birds.

In December he proposed fines of up to $1,000 for persistent pigeon feeders in the area.

And this week Aldermann took responsibility for the physical capture and removal of the birds to the neighboring state.

'An Indiana farmer contacted us and offered to capture and take pigeons to his farm,' Cappleman spokeswoman Tressa Feher said. 'He wanted them alive.'

Other than the fact that the farmer in question had visited Chicago four times, this is all Aldermann's office were prepared to say.

Smith was shocked by the episode. 'It was so bizarre and so disturbing, it couldnâ€™t even compute to me,' she told CBS. But there's very little in the way of legal pigeon protection.

The state of Illinois classifies pigeons as a nuisance. As such, the birds are not protected by any laws, so these 'removals' may continue for some time.
