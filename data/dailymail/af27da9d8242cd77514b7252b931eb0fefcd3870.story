Looking out over the Arizona wilderness, balanced only on a two ince wide piece of wire suspended between two rock outcrops.

For some this is a nightmare scary enough to make you wake up in a cold sweat.

But to others it is all in a day's work.

These pictures show four thrill-seekers as they walk the line, risking life and limb on a highline stretched 80ft wide and anchored 100ft in the air between two rock outcrops in the Sedona wilderness, in northern Arizona.

What a view: Wilson Cutbirth of Cornville, Arizona, walks across a slackline 100ft high over the Sedona wilderness

Scary moment: Zac Timmons tries to land a trick jump but misses the landing

Amazing balance: Fortunately the highliners are tethered on to the wire in case they are ever failed by their sublime skill

In these pictures, highliners Zac Timmons, Wilson Cutbirth, Brendan Adair and Eli Wexler, all from Arizona, masterfully show the sport off in all its glory.

One of the images however shows the heart-stopping moment Timmons attempts to land a trick jump but misses his footing.

Fortunately participants of the highlining are tethered to the line so that they don't fall.

Highlining is a form of slacklining, which is the art of balancing on two inch wide nylon webbing tensioned between to points. 

The sport is similar to walking a tightrope, only the webbing used in highlining has more slack. 

Sedona is situated on the county line between the Coconino and Yavapai counties in the northern Verde Valley region of the state of Arizona.

Careful chaps: Timmons, left, recovers from failing to land his attempted trick jump, while to the untrained eye at least Wilson Cutbirth doesn't look too comfortable on the wire

Tough as old boots: Eli Wexler's feet look like they have become used to the demands of a highliner

The major attraction of the town, which has a population of 10,031, is its red sandstone formations, known as the Red Rocks of Sedona.

The rocks appear to glow in brilliant orange and red when illuminated by the rising or setting sun and are the home to activities ranging from extreme sports to spiritual pursuits.

Rope walking has been around in various forms for thousands of years, but the origin of slacklining is usually attributed to rock climbers Adam Grosowsky and Jeff Ellington from their time at Washington's The Evergreen State College in 1979.

Watchful eye: Baja the dog looks on as Brendan Adair walks across the slackline in Arizona
