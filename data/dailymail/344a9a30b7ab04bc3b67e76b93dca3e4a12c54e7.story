A postal worker claiming disability benefits after injuring herself on the job has been accused of being a liar after she appeared on The Price is Right and spun the 'big wheel' twice without difficulty.

Cathy Wrench Cashwell, a grandmother from Fayetteville, North Carolina, said that she was unable to lift trays of mail after she hurt her shoulder while at work in 2004.

But she pleaded guilty to fraud in federal court on Monday after an indictment claimed she appeared physically well while on the game show in September 2009.

Caught: Cathy Wrench Cashwell, pictured with her husband, allegedly claimed disability benefits for an injured shoulder even though she was seen spinning the wheel twice on The Price is Right

It explained that she 'raised her left arm above her head and gripped the handle with her left hand' during her first spin of the wheel, WRAL reported.

On the second spin, she 'raised both arms above her head and gripped the same handle with both hands', the September 2012 indictment added.

But the game show, where contestants guess the prices of items and then spin the wheel for more money, was not the only time Cashwell was caught allegedly swindling her employers.

In August 2010, she allegedly went zip-lining on a Carnival Cruise vacation, and in 2011, she was seen lifting furniture and bags of groceries with both of her arms.

Despite this physical activity, Cashwell wrote on worker's compensation paperwork in 2011 that she could not 'stand, sit, kneel, squat, climb, bend, reach or grasp', WRAL reported.

'I've seen every kind of case you can see,' said private investigator Allison Blackman.

'Sometimes you have to get in the woods and bushes. The secret is you've got to have your camera up, when they do what they're doing.'

Cashwell will be sentenced in September.
