Louis van Gaal has revealed he wants his Manchester United team to play in the same style as Sunday's opponents Everton as he once again prepared to be without a raft of players this weekend.

United boss Van Gaal said this afternoon he will be without nine first team players for the visit of Roberto Martinez's side from Merseyside and revealed that central defender Paddy McNair will be selected once again after his debut against West Ham last week.

But the Dutchman continues his quest for following football and believes Everton and their Spanish coach are a fitting template.

Despite the glowing praise of Everton, Van Gaal still insists he wants United to dominate the Premier League fixture

Van Gaal said: 'I have to say that I like Everton because they want to play football like I want to play football. It shall be a very interesting game.

'I know Manchester United lost to them twice last year so they're a difficult opponent.

'I hope we can dominate the game but they want to dominate the game also. They are more allowed to play on the counter than we are so that's also the difficulty.'

Van Gaal will be hoping his car trouble isn't a bad omen for him ahead of Manchester United's clash with Everton this weekend.

The Red Devils boss suffered a flat tyre while out and about driving and signing autographs on Thursday.

United have several players back in training but Van Gaal has revealed that players like Marouane Fellaini are not yet ready for 90 minutes.

'It's difficult to explain but you can be fit but not match fit, that's the big difference,' he added.

'So, for example, Herrera is fit but he can't play because of his rib fracture. He's fit. But he can not play. So, for example Fellaini has trained one week but he's not fit to play 90 minutes.

'We have eight injuries and one red card so nine players are not available to play. 

'I believe we still have three central defenders injured so McNair shall play. He's the only player that can play in that right central defender position. I have chosen him last week.

'For a player like him it's very difficult to maintain that level. That is his biggest challenge.' 

Van Gaal also revealed that he has spoken to executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward about playing midweek exhibition games and has given the go-ahead.

He said: 'I agree with that. I said that also.

'We have spoken last week with each other and Ed Woodward so I fully agree.

'I'm used to playing midweeks but I have said in the first three months we have to wait because it's difficult enough for the players to adapt and adjust to the new play organisation and style and they shall honour that also but we shall play midweeks.

'It's good because I like to play games against high level opponents.'
