In the battle to be the most extravagant mega yacht on the seas, it takes a lot to really impress.

While helipads, waterslides, and movie theatres are commonplace additions to the yachts of the super wealthy, a stylish Italian vessel is making waves for being the first  to feature a floating drive-in garage.

J'ade, by Ferretti group company CRN, features a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water.

Innovative: The 196-foot yacht has a hydraulic-operated hatch which can store an eight-metre speedboat without the use of a tender lift to hoist it out of the water

Floating fortress: While swimming pools and helipads are commonplace on many a mega yacht, J'ade features the world's first floating garage

Glide in: The internal basin floods and empties 18,000 litres of water in just three minutes, allowing the boat to enter the yacht without the use of a crane

The internal basin, which holds 18,000 litres of water, floods and empties in just three minutes, enabling the boat (a 27ft Riva Iseo) to enter the yacht without using a crane.

When the speedboat is not being stored inside, the basin can also be utilised as an indoor ocean pool, accessible from the lower-deck terrace.

Completed last year, the 60-metre yacht was the star attraction at last week's Monaco Yacht Show, where it was a finalist  for the Best Interior award, only to miss out on the prize to the brand-new Perini Navi motor yacht Grace E.

J'ade made its debut at the annual yacht show last year, and also won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show.

Honey, I'm home: The one-of-a-kind  garage enables the owner to access the yacht from their speed boat internally, via the vessel's plush lower deck

Multi-purpose: When the speedboat is not being stored, the basin can also be used as an internal ocean pool, located just behind this luxury terrace

Beauty: The vessel won the World Yacht Trophy at the 2013 International Boat Show and was nominated for Best Interior at the 2014 Monaco Yacht Show

The privately-owned yacht was created by Studio Zuccon International Project, and is designed to feel 'at one with the sea'.

The 196-foot vessel can comfortable accommodate 10 guests in four cabins and the owner suite, and 13 crew members. Aside from the impressive 'garage', J'ade also features a gymnasium, hammam room and aquarium.

Across the four decks, materials for the interiors are Canaletto walnut and polished rosewood. The hardwood floors are made of wide Afromosia strips and the cabins and owner suite are fitted with white Tai Ping carpets. There are jade green accents throughout the interior.

A life of luxury: Guests on board the J'Ade can also soak up the sun on one of the vessel's comfy lounging areas, located across all four of the  decks

Pool on board: If a swim in the ocean becomes a bit daunting for those on board, guests can take a dip in this on-deck plunge pool

Spa: The mega yacht also features a gymnasium and mosaic-tiled hammam room (pictured), where guests can sit back and unwind after a day at sea

No expense spared: The privately-owned yacht was designed for the owner's specific tastes, and includes a round bath in the boat's marble master suite

Made for entertaining: Guests on board the vessel, created by Studio Zuccon International Project, can be sure of a place to sit at several indoor and outdoor living areas

The centrepiece of the yacht is the central stairwell with a crystal lift. A white Yamaha piano sits in the living area.

‘CRN is experimenting,’ Luca Boldrini, CRN’s sales director told Boat International. 

‘We’re experimenting in design, in sizes, and in features. Each of the yachts in build has special features in development, and we hope the next step will be to mix and match all these new features in one or two new concepts so future owners can not only have a beautiful, seaworthy and safe vessel, but they can have special features that nobody else has. 

'These will not be special features that are just an experiment, but features clients can touch and feel in other vessels under construction or already floating.’

'At one with the sea': Oversized windows were purpose-built to take advantage of the sea views, and anyone lucky enough to stay in this cabin can also enjoy a balcony terrace, giving them an even better panorama across the ocean

Musical tastes: Got musical guests on board? They can tinkle the ivories on this stunning white Yamaha piano, which takes pride of place in the living area

All at sea: The well-appointed living area combines elegant sofas with driftwood coffee tables and shell-inspired sculptures and bowls to give the room a nautical flavour

Anyone for dinner? The formal dining table comfortably seats 12 guests, while after dinner guests can relax with a digestif on the adjacent seating area

Informal: When the dining table is a bit too formal, breakfast and lunch can be taken on the terrace, with this round table comfortably seating nine people

Guest quarters: The vessel can accommodate 10 guests split across four cabins, plus the owner suite, as well as 13 crew members to cater to those on board
