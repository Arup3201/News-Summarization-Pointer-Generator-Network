Another day and more disappointment from the effect that poor officiating is having on this Premier league season. 

Chelsea, Manchester City and West Ham who were all in the top 5 before play started were all victims whilst close rivals Southampton and Arsenal were beneficiaries. 

Penalties, dives and offsides were called incorrectly as we reached the halfway point of a wholly unsatisfactory season from too many select group officials.

Chelsea players, in particular Cesc Fabregas, were rightly upset with Anthony Taylor's decision on Sunday

Alex Song and Andy Carroll complain to referee Neil Swarbrick after Song's strike was disallowed

Joe Hart let's George Boyd's flick slip through his hands, but the Burnley man should have been flagged offside

Craig Pawson inexplicably missed Papiss Cisse's elbow on Seamus Coleman during Newcastle vs Everton

Cisse went on to score Newcastle's first goal, which made it 1-1, but is likely to face a ban for the violence

Whilst the Papiss Cisse incident does not affect the top 6 it was the worst offence of the day for which he will be banned retrospectively by the Football Association for his outrageous elbow. 

The more times you see what can only be described as an assault by the Senegalese striker the worse it gets but had Pawson seen it, and I wonder how he didn’t, he would have dismissed him and a standard ban applied which is what the FA must apply.

The most controversial was the caution for Cesc Fabregas who will have that yellow card against his name which could result in a ban and the football association must be pressed to review this process. 

Cesc Fabregas is clearly caught by Matt Targett, causing him to go down in the Southampton penalty area

Fabregas cannot believe the decision to deny him a penalty and book him for diving - the FA should overturn it

I have called for referees to be given more training and advice regarding simulation which needs to come from within the game as players and managers understand this offence far better than officials.

West Ham’s ‘goal’ from Alex Song provides the best debate for the day. It was a superb strike from Song which Wojciech Szczesny cannot see due to a cluster of players from both teams. 

There were three West Ham players in offside positions as Song kicked the ball but all three were running out, ‘disassociating themselves from play’ and so not deemed to be interfering with play. 

Song's strike should have been given as the West Ham players were 'disassociating themselves from play’

Diafra Sakho, who ran over the ball, was clearly not in Wojciech Szczesny's line of sight when Song shot

The ball travels towards the corner of the goal where Diafra Sakho jumps over it and as he is not in the line of sight of the goalkeeper he is not interfering with the ‘keeper. 

Replays from behind the goal show that Andy Carroll could be in Szczesny’s line of sight hence the assistant’s raised flag but it’s a goal that I would have wanted to stand.

So, not a great day for officials although to be fair Phil Dowd was correct with bot dismissals at Hull as was Martin Atkinson in sending off Fabian Delph for an over the top tackle at Villa Park so it wasn’t all bad.

Martin Atkinson was right to send off Aston Villa's Fabia Delph for a tackle than went over the ball

Phil Dowd was spot on with both his red cards, dismissing Paul Konchesky and Stephen Quinn

Remember that on Boxing Day QPR were denied a clear penalty (Gibbs on Zamora), Sunderland should have had two penalties for handball against Hull (Bruce and Quinn), Ivanovic should have been cautioned for diving, Newcastle should have had an early penalty when Mata tripped Gouffran and Stoke’s Jon Walters should have been dismissed for pulling Everton’s Leighton Baines when clean through on goal.

Cesc Fabregas booking for diving against Crystal Palace was a travesty

@highlight

West Ham were very unlucky to see Alex Song's wonder-strike ruled out

@highlight

Papiss Cisse should have see red for his elbow on Seamus Coleman 

@highlight

Cesc Fabregas was clearly tripped by Matt Targett and should have been awarded a penalty; instead he was cautioned by Anthony Taylor which was a travesty.

@highlight

Alex Song scored a superb goal which was disallowed by referee Neil Swarbrick under advice from his assistant, Matthew Wilkes.

@highlight

Manchester City were comfortably 2-0 up when Burnley scored a goal to get themselves back into the game but the scorer, George Boyd was clearly in an offside position.

@highlight

Everton will rue referee Craig Pawson somehow missing Papiss Cisse clearly and viciously elbow Seamus Coleman whilst waiting for a corner at St James’ Park – Cisse, who was offside in the build up to the next corner, then scored the first goal for Newcastle.

@highlight

Jon Moss missing Wayne Rooney clearly holding Tottenham’s Harry Kane to prevent him from competing for the ball at a set piece. A clear penalty which could have led to the only goal of the game.
