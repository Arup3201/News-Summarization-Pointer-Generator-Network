A 24-year-old woman was arrested on Tuesday for having sex with her jailed boyfriend's 15-year-old nephew.

The boy was staying at his family's home in Hialeah, Miami, on November 25, when Caridad Munoz entered his bedroom and allegedly solicited sex.

The 15-year-old had a condom in his wallet which they used. Munoz apparently took the wrapper and used condom and put it in her purse after the act.

According to a police report she also performed oral sex on the boy.

The Miami Herald reports that Munoz had allegedly been smoking marijuana before the pair engaged in intercourse.

The police report says that Munoz offered drugs to the boy who said no. She also allegedly asked the boy where she could find marijuana, molly, and cocaine.

It adds: 'Since he was a virgin he felt intimidated by the defendant.'

After questioning, Munoz admitted to having sex with the minor.

NBC Miami reports that Munoz now faces charges of lewd and lascivious battery of a minor, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

NBC spoke to Hialeah Police spokesman Carl Zogby who said, 'He cannot legally consent to having sex with an adult. She's 24, he's 15, and now, she's in trouble for that. If convicted, she could serve up to 10 years and have to register as a sex offender.'

Munoz does not appear at this time to have a previous criminal record. Her bond is set at $32,000.
