Life asked 'Who wants to go for walkies?' and one pooch couldn't say no.

In a video posted to YouTube, an injured terrier in a cast hops through the door to her house and walks around on her hind legs before popping out again.

This pooch's owner says she broke both her front legs after an ill-advised leap off a six-foot-high deck but the daredevil dog refused to take it lying down.

Dog gone: A pup learned how to walk like a human on her two hind legs after being injured in a leap off a porch

Daredevil: The terrier couldn't be stopped by her casts or her cone, and can be seen jumping in and out of the house

In the video posted by her human, the dog shows off an impressive walk that might just become her preferred way of travel.

If you've been putting off your running regimen, this pup will put you to shame.
