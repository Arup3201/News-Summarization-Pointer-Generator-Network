A culture of ruthless mis-selling at Lloyds Bank was laid bare yesterday as the State-backed lender was fined a record £28million by the City watchdog.

In an explosive report, the Financial Conduct Authority revealed how Lloyds salesmen had been promised ‘champagne bonuses’ for ripping off customers by selling them products they did not want or need.

In some cases workers were told their pay would be halved if they did not hit targets for selling the worthless products.

Sale fail: Lloyds Bank has been handed a record £28million fine by the Financial Conduct Authority for ripping off their customers

One salesman was so desperate to meet his target he sold insurance to himself, his wife and a colleague to prevent his salary from being cut.

Last night MPs called for chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio to be stripped of his £2.5million bonus, awarded last month, saying it was ‘an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers’.

They said the bank – which was bailed out with £20billion of taxpayers’ money in 2008 – had failed to learn from the payment protection insurance mis-selling scandal, which has saddled it with an £8billion compensation bill so far.

The report came on a day of shame for Britain’s State-backed banks, with RBS separately handed a £62millon fine in America for making illegal deals with Iran.

Shamed: MPs have called for Lloyds' CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio to be stripped of his £2.5million bonus, awarded last month

The Financial Conduct Authority’s shocking findings included:

The fine given to Lloyds dwarfs the previous record of £10.5million, jointly held by HSBC and credit card insurer CPP.

Tracey McDermott, the FCA’s director of enforcement and financial crime, said: ‘Customers have a right to expect better from our leading financial institutions and we expect firms to put customers first. But firms will never be able to do this if they incentivise their staff to do the opposite.’

Retired nurse Kathleen Coackley is a victim of Lloyds’ bonus-driven culture.

The 67-year-old from  Cheadle in Cheshire walked into a branch of the bank simply to ask about a loan to buy a car.

But during her visit an adviser pulled up her bank details and pressured her into putting the £27,000 she had saved to fund her retirement into a complex investment linked to the stock market.

She was told it was no-risk and she would make a big profit, but when the investment matured she received just £100 profit.

Mrs Coackley would have received more by putting her cash into an ordinary savings account.

She said: ‘I have never changed banks and have trusted them implicitly with my salary and savings over the years. Not for a moment, despite all the banking horror stories, did I think they would cheat me.’

After initially fobbing off Mrs Coackley’s complaint, Lloyds agreed to pay her £4,000 in compensation.

The wrongdoing occurred between January 2010 and March 2012, when Lloyds embarked on a major push to sell more insurance products because they were so profitable.

These included critical illness policies, that are supposed to pay out a lump sum if a customer is diagnosed with a serious illness.

The probe did not include payment protection insurance, which Lloyds stopped selling in July 2010.

The FCA’s investigation also focused on sales of risky stock market investments, such as shares Isas, as well as highly complex investments called structured products.

During this period, advisers from Lloyds TSB, Halifax and Bank of Scotland – all part of Lloyds Banking Group – sold 1.1 million of these products to more than 690,000 customers.

To boost sales, the bank changed the way it paid its staff so they were encouraged to sell as many of these policies as possible.

This included introducing ‘variable basic salaries’ where salesman who hit their targets could automatically be promoted and get a pay rise.

Those who fell short would automatically be demoted and get a pay cut.

The FCA said ‘the risks to customer’ posed by advisers struggling to hit their targets were ‘particularly acute’.

But the rewards for those who did make the grade were handsome, with Lloyds TSB salesmen receiving bonuses of up to £6,389 a month.

These protection products were also hugely lucrative for the bank, which earned £600 commission for each sale.

Seven in ten Lloyds TSB advisers received their monthly bonus even though the bank had identified that many of their sales were unsuitable.

Last night Conservative MP Mark Garnier said: ‘Clearly the embedded culture of mis-selling has not been cleared away since the financial crisis. The evidence is Lloyds has learned nothing from the PPI mis-selling crisis.’

And the bank came under pressure to strip Mr Horta-Osorio of his £2.5million shares bonus – awarded last month for his work in 2012.

Labour MP John Mann, a member of the Treasury select committee, said: ‘There won’t be a taxpayer in Britain who thinks he should get this money.

'He should pay every penny back. This is an extraordinary award for gross incompetence and fleecing his own customers.’

Lloyds has been ordered to review sales to all these customers and pay compensation where necessary. It has set aside £100million to pay the fine and compensation, as well as the cost of the review.

In a rare move, the FCA said it had increased the bank’s fine by 10 per cent because it had ignored a warning about its sales culture a decade ago from the previous watchdog, the Financial Services Authority.

A bank spokesman said: ‘The Group recognises that its oversight of these particular schemes during the period in question was inadequate and apologises.’
