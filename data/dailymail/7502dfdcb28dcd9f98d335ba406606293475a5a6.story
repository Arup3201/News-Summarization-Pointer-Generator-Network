A curious toddler who climbed a chest of drawers because he wanted to reach his toys was crushed to death in a 'horrific' accident, an inquest has heard.

Mason Tipping, aged 22 months, who was described by his devastated parents as being 'full of life', started climbing up the drawers at his home in Colchester, Essex when he was unable to reach a toy.

But the drawers, which weighed more than three-and-a-half stone, toppled over and crushed the little boy to death.

Mason Tipping, who was 22 months, was crushed to death after a chest of drawers on which he had tried to climb fell on top of him

At an inquest into Mason's death, the court heard how his parents had screwed the bottom two drawers shut to stop their son from using them as steps.

But, tragically, their bid to make the drawers safer made the furniture top-heavy.

Essex Coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said the Mason's death, which took place in December 2012, was a 'tragic' accident.

She said: 'Really, the chest of drawers was a bit top-heavy.

'It was a horrific, tragic accident. He was a much-loved little boy with probably a bright future in front of him.'

The inquest was told how Mason's mother Christine Tauchert, 42, raced into the room when she heard her daughter crying.

After seeing her son beneath the drawers, she shouted for Mason's father, Adrian Tipping, to come and lift the furniture off him.

But despite Mr Tipping's efforts to give his son first aid, Mason died shortly afterwards at Colchester General Hospital. The cause of death was given as 'positional asphyxia'.

Mason's parents, who have two other children, Keira and Faye, have 
previously warned other parents about the hidden and unexpected 
dangers which can be lurking through the home.

After the accident, Mr Tipping said: 'I hope no-one else has to go through this and I hope parents 
will take the time just to attach cabinets to walls.

'For
 the sake of a bracket that will cost a few quid, it could make all the 
difference as we don't want anyone else to have to go through this.'

Detective Constable Lee Pollard told the inquest he went to the couple's flat on November 9, 2012 as part of routine inquiries following a death.

Mason's parents had screwed the bottom two drawers together to stop their curious son using them as steps, which made the chest of drawers top heavy

He said there was no evidence of anything suspicious surrounding Mason's death.

He said: 'It was explained to me that Mason had previously tried to climb the drawers in order to get to the toys.

'The bottom two drawers were shut, leaving access to the top three drawers which contained clothing.'

Mr Tipping, 31, paid tribute to their son after the accident, saying : 'Mason was so full of 
life, he was always climbing and nothing would faze him.

'That's why the drawers had been fastened shut. It keeps running through my mind that what I did caused the drawers to fall.'

Speaking after the inquest, he added: 'We are happy with the outcome. We could not have expected anything else.'

His mother, who is a carer, said: 'I had taken Mason to baby massage classes and he had joined the local group for toddlers. I did everything I could to spend time with him. He was a gentle giant.'
