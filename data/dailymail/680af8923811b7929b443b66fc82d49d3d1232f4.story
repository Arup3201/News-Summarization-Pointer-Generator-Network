An alleged mob boss who pleaded to be released on bail on grounds of his diabetes has reportedly been eating junk food including Pringles and Hershey candy bars while in jail.

Thomas 'Tommy D' DiFiore had applied to be released on $4m bail at a hearing in Brooklyn Federal Court last month, claiming his Type 2 diabetes was out of control.

But prosecution witness Dr Robin Edwin said the 70-year-old's commissary purchases revealed he had been buying food which would not have helped the condition.

DiFiore, of Commack, Long Island, was said to have been purchasing foods including Ramen-flavoured chili noodles, six-packs of Hershey candy bars, peanut butter and Pepsi cola, according to The New York Daily News.

Dr Edwin reportedly told the court: 'These all would cause his sugars to go up quite high and it would be very hard to control diabetes while they're consuming these foods.'

Federal Judge Allyne Ross denied DiFiore's bid for release, ruling he was a danger to the public. He was arrested on extortion charges in January.

DiFiore's lawyer Steve Zissou said the commissary purchases were for other inmates and were not consumed by his client.

DiFiore was one of five alleged high-ranking members of the Bonanno organised crime family arrested and charged in January, including Vincent Asaro, 78, a suspect in the 1978 Lufthansa heist at JFK which inspired the film Goodfellas.

Asaro was charged with the theft of $5 million in cash and $1 million in jewellry from the Lufthansa Terminal at JFK airport on December 11, 1978.

At the time, it was the biggest cash heist ever in the U.S. The stolen $5 million would be worth $17.9 million in 2013 dollars, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

During a brief hearing at a Brooklyn 
court in January following the arrests, Asaro, the alleged leader of the
 Bonanno organized crime family, pleaded not guilty to robbery charges.

DiFiore and three other men, who prosecutors claimed were members of the New York-based gang, were arrested for other crimes.
