A high-flying estate agent has been told she faces jail after stealing £1.3million from her firm and used it to fund a luxury lifestyle of private planes and exotic holidays. 

Karen Chin, who worked as the financial controller of upmarket estate agents Hurford Salvi Carr in Clerkenwell, central London, diverted clients' money into her own account between 2008 and 2013.

The 45-year-old, who earned £38,000-a-year, stole a total of £1.3million after making 304 payments into her own bank accounts - taking an average of £260,000 a year over a five year period.

Blackfriars Crown Court heard how Chin, who lived in a £1.5million house in Highgate, north London, spent the money on flash watches, handbags, clothes and jewellery - as well as luxury holidays.

The court heard how she even chartered a private plane as well as splashing out £35,000 on a luxury family holiday to Mauritius.

David Markham, prosecuting, said Chin had worked at the firm since 1999, but was sacked in June 2013 after she was suspected of stealing from client accounts.

'She was trusted with the company chequebook and all the online payments, but an audit report revealed she had been dishonestly siphoning off client account funds into her own accounts,' he said.

'She was authorised to make payments and transfers and was a co-signatory with the directors of the company.'

Chin is accused to moving the cash to 'secret accounts' after she was sacked - and now faces an investigation to locate the missing money under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

Judge David Richardson told Chin, who admitted nine counts of fraud between February 2008 and February 2013, that she was facing an 'inevitable prison term'.

He told her: 'You are plainly going to prison and the only question is for how long. I want to know what you have done with the money and if it is true you have been shifting assets.'

He remanded her in custody ahead of sentencing on February 13, telling her: 'I have no intention of leaving you outside prison where you may cause further mischief in relation to your assets.'

A spokesman for Hurford Salvi Carr said: 'An audit carried out in 2013 identified a number of accounting irregularities.

'These were reported to the police and have culminated in a former employee pleading guilty to nine counts of fraud at Blackfriars Court. No financial losses were incurred by clients, tenants or third parties.'
