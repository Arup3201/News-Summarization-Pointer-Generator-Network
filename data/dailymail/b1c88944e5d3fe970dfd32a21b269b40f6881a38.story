The domination of apps such as Whatsapp, Viber and Facebook Messenger is continuing to grow, according to a new report.

Researchers at Deloitte claim the average person sends seven text messages a day, compared to 46 instant messages.

And, by the end of the year, they predict more than 300 billion instant messages will be sent in the UK alone.

Research from Deloitte has revealed the average person sends seven text messages a day, compared to 46 instant messages. Experts predicts the number of instant message will reach 300 billion by the end of the year, and almost a quarter of smartphone owners use five or more messaging apps, such as Whatsapp (pictured)

The findings come from the Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2014, which polled more than 3,600 people in May this year. 

A recent poll from computer-tracking software firm RetinaX studios discovered the peak sexting hours are between 10am and noon on Tuesdays.

The study, which polled 4,800 people, also revealed iPhone users sext almost twice as frequently as Android users.

University of Michigan researchers recently studied the sexting behaviour of 3,447 men and women aged between 18 and 24. 

They discovered that nearly half of the study respondents participated in sexting.

Most people who reported receiving sexts also reported sending them, which the study claimed suggests sexting is reciprocal and likely happens between romantic partners.

If correct, this prediction would mean instant messaging has almost doubled in popularity in just a year, up from 160 billion last year, and 25 billion in 2010. 

Text messages are still the most popular form of communication, but instant messaging leads on the number of messages sent.

And Deloitte is also predicting that 2014 will be the first year texting will decline since it was invented in 1992.

‘During different phases of your life. You talk more and are more social,’ Deloitte’s head of technology, media and telecommunications Paul Lee told the MailOnline.

‘And generally when you’re younger and you’re looking for a relationship, you talk with more people.

If correct, Deloitte's prediction would mean instant messaging has almost doubled in popularity in just a year, up from 160 billion last year, and 25 billion in 2010 (plotted on this graph). The findings come from the Deloitte Global Mobile Consumer Survey 2014

‘This has always been the case, it’s just text messaging replaced phone calls, and IM messages are having a similar impact on texts.

‘Instant messaging also offers new ways to communicate, so whereas before we would send a sentence to express our sentiments, people now exchange emoticons and images.’

When asked why texts and instant messages are seen by smartphone users as being so different, yet are fundamentally the same, Mr Lee said that it’s down to habits and cost.

Text messages are still the most popular form of communication (as seen in this graph) but instant messaging leads on the number of messages sent overall. Deloitte is also predicting that 2014 will be the first year texting will decline since it was invented in 1992

‘Around 10 years ago, teenagers would visit internet cafes and send hundreds and thousands of IMs to each other.

‘That behaviour hasn’t changed, it’s just moved onto smartphones. In the same way emails are now accessible on phones.

‘Also, IMs don’t have a marginal cost, so people can be quite wasteful with the amount of IMs they send.

'Individual text messages, traditionally, came at a cost and even though the price is now lower, and in some cases is free on unlimited plans, this perception is difficult to change.’
