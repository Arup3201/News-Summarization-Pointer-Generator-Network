A former police detective battered his partner senseless with a baseball bat in front of their two young children after a petty row over a missing baby changing bag.

Peter Foster, 36, bludgeoned police constable Heather Cooper and then stabbed her in the throat just weeks after she had given birth.

He then drove her body to a wood and buried the 33-year-old in a shallow grave before sending a series of texts from her mobile phone to try to create an alibi.

Killer: Foster is led away from Lewes Crown Court after today's sentencing

When he was eventually arrested for 
the murder – described by a judge as ‘wicked, savage and senseless’ – 
Foster led officers to her body but insisted he had acted in 
self-defence.

But after an agonising eight-month wait for her family, his flimsy explanation was yesterday exposed as pure fiction.

The former detective constable, who 
left the Surrey force in disgrace after receiving a suspended jail 
sentence for drink-driving in 2010, changed his plea to guilty as a 
result.

Foster was jailed for life and ordered
 to serve at least 17 years by Judge Richard Brown at Lewes Crown Court 
who described him as an ‘extremely dangerous individual’.

In a victim impact statement Miss 
Cooper’s parents, James and Caroline Cooper, said the murder had an 
unimaginable impact on the two children who witnessed the attack.

Joshua, who is now three, and Isabel,
 who was only three months old at the time, had been handed a life 
sentence by the loss of their devoted mother, they said.

On the day of the murder Joshua, a 
‘normally playful’ little boy, was asked where his mother was. Subdued 
and quiet he simply replied: ‘Sleeping.’

‘Joshua was present when his mother 
was brutally murdered. We cannot envisage what he is experiencing and 
what is going on in the mind of this three-year-old,’ they said.

The court was told how the couple had
 been to a christening on October 16 when an argument started about a 
missing baby changing bag.

They sat with their backs to each 
other in the church and left early without attending the reception, 
Benjamin Aina QC, prosecuting, said.

The row continued when the couple returned to their £700,000 home in Haslemere, Surrey.

Foster, who was known to have a ‘short
 fuse’, later claimed Miss Cooper, an ‘exceptional’ officer with Surrey 
Police, swiped at him with a knife while he was carrying Isabel.

He told police that, in self-defence, 
he hit her once with a baseball bat. She then left the room and he later
 found her with a knife through her throat.

In reality, Miss Cooper had been hit 
more than ten times with the bat, whilst the stabbing had happened after
 she was unconscious, post-mortem results revealed.

Foster had, in fact, taken time to 
clean up the blood-soaked crime scene and taken Miss Cooper’s body to 
Blackdown Woods, near Lurgashall, West Sussex, where he covered it with 
bracken.

He also made several trips to the home
 of his grandmother, Marguerite Halkins, where he had left his two 
children. Foster later contacted Miss Cooper’s mother by text, 
pretending to be her daughter and reassuring her all was well.

He then told his cousin, David Foster,
 some of the details about what happened and he alerted police. When 
officers arrived at Miss Halkins’ home, Foster told them: ‘You should 
arrest me’. When they asked him what for, he replied: ‘Murder’.

Philippa McAtasney QC, mitigating, 
said Foster had expressed ‘genuine remorse’. ‘He knows he has ruined all
 of their lives and knows that nothing he can say can undo the pain and 
the hurt that everyone feels,’ she said.

The home Miss Cooper shared with Foster in Haslemere is just four miles away from the spot in Blackdown Woods where her body was found

She said he left the police after a 
nine-year career after he was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment, 
suspended for a year, for drink-driving and danger- ous driving.

Miss Cooper, who grew up in York, 
joined Surrey Police in 2003 and worked in the Public Protection 
Investigation Unit based at Guildford.

During her career she received several
 letters of praise from senior officers for her work on various crimes 
and in 2009 was given a commendation by the force for her 
‘professionalism, dedication and commitment’.
