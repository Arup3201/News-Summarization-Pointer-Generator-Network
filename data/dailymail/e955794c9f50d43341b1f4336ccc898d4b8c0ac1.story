Gary Lineker took a cheeky swipe at Bradford City as Phil Parkinson's side fell to a 3-0 FA Cup quarter-final replay defeat against Reading on Monday night.

The BBC has come in for criticism after overlooking the League One club despite their stunning upset of Chelsea in the last 32.

Bradford's Twitter account also posted a tweet aimed at Lineker and fellow BBC presenter Mark Chapham following the club's 2-0 giant killing against Sunderland in the next round.

Along with a 'Bradford 1-0 BBC' image, the Bantams tweeted: 'See you in the next round @GaryLineker @markchapman Don't stand us up this time....' 

And with Bradford finally being given their time to shine with live coverage on BBC One, Lineker joked that he wasn't sure why the Bantams had made 'such a fuss'.

He tweeted: 'Not sure why Bradford made such a fuss about not being on the BBC.' 

First-half goals from Hal Robson-Kanu and Garath McCleary gave the home side an impressive early lead before Jamie Mackie added a third goal to set up a Wembley semi-final against holders Arsenal.
