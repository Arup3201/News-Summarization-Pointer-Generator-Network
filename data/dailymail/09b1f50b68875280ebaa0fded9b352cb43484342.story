A suspect who has been on the run from the police for more than two months is bragging about his fugitive status on Facebook.

Anthony Swinburn, 28, boasts of enjoying a top-of-the-range Sky TV package and his girlfriend’s alleged cannabis habit.

He has mocked police efforts to find him by posting his own ‘Wanted’ poster on the website.

Anthony Swinburn uploaded the Wild West-style wanted poster onto his Facebook page. He has been on the run from West Midlands Police since November

Last night it appeared the crook even had a sense of humour.

After news of his Facebook page hit 
the media, Swinburn changed his name on Facebook to ‘Bonnie Clyde’, a 
reference to the Depression-era American outlaws Bonnie Parker and Clyde
Barrow.

Swinburn appears as one of 103 
suspects on West Midland Police’s website page of ‘wanted’ fugitives.

He
went missing after failing to appear at Warwick Crown Court on November
9 on charges of common assault and theft.

But for weeks, Swinburn has been 
bragging about his life on the run via a string of appallingly written 
updates on Facebook. Recent entries mention the snowy weather, bets on 
football matches and even his efforts to lose weight.

His Facebook page states that he 
currently lives in his home city of Coventry, and that he has been ‘in a
relationship’ with Stacey-Leigh Williams since April 29, 2012.

In one message he described  how he was about to tuck into a steak, onion rings, chicken wings and fries.

Swinburn failed to appear at Warwick Crown Court and has since regularly updated his Facebook profile

Police said they will investigate after being told about Swinburn's messages and wanted poster

Another, written in ‘text speak’ on 
January 13, says: ‘Aint seen snow 4 a while so I’ve woke the household 
up, put the xmas tree bk up and dancin around like a big kid with my 
poor lil tierd princess who has had jus about enuff ov my energetic 
burstz ov energy at silly o’clock in the morninz.’

The following day, he wrote: ‘Chicken stew and dumplinz wiv princess stacey and then chill-time 2 watch abit ov t.v.’

In one of his latest messages to 
friends, he described how he was about to have Sky TV ‘with every 
channel’ installed. Swinburn even posted pictures of himself at home, as
well as another snap of himself on a train and drinking a can of cider 
in a garden.

He mocked up his own ‘Wanted’ poster 
before Christmas. It features a grinning picture of himself wearing a 
blue baseball cap and sporting a tattoo on his throat.

The suspect used to live in a terraced
house on the outskirts of Coventry city centre with his family. The 
current occupant said: ‘I remember him.

‘He lived here before me but moved to Nuneaton.

‘The police turned up a couple of months ago looking for him.’

West Midlands Police yesterday said they would investigate Swinburn’s online activity.
