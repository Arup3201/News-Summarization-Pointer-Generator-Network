Quiet kid: Darion Aguilar is the suspected gunman who shot two dead before turning the gun on himself at a Maryland mall Saturday

A Maryland mall shooter who killed two skate store employees last weekend wrote about killing people in his journal and said he was ready to die, police revealed Wednesday.

Darion Aguilar did not mention targeting specific people or locations in his writing, according to Howard County Police, but rather expressed 'a general hatred of others' and acknowledged he had a mental illness.

The 19-year-old is believed to have shot dead young mother, Brianna Benlolo, 21, of College Park, and Tyler Johnson, 25, of Mount Airy, in a Zumiez skate store at the Mall in Columbia and then took his own life.

Detectives have as yet failed to find a motive in the shootings, but they said the pages of his journal, which had sporadic entries over a one-year period, show he 'knew he was having mental health issues.'

'Aguilar mentions killing people, but in general terms. he does not mention the victims, or any other specific person,' Howard County police said through Twitter.

'(He) indicates he thought he needed a mental health professional but never told his family. He also mentions using marijuana.'

He also apologized to his family for what he was planning to do and said his 'plan was set' without referring to what the plan was, police said.

Also on Wednesday, new details were released about how Aguilar prepared for the horror shooting.

Aguilar carried the disassembled 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun into the mall in a backpack and put the shotgun together in a dressing room at the Zumiez skateboard store.

'Police believe Aguilar exited the Zumiez dressing room, shot the two victims and then himself,' they said.

Earlier, investigators had said that Aguilar had spent at least an hour in the mall before initiating the spree.

The skate store itself had no video cameras so there is no footage of the shootings.

Another
 victim, who was shot in the foot on the upper level of the mall, was 
identified as Susan Kay Straumanis, 49, from Hanover.

Shooter Darion Marcus Aguilar, 19, from College Park, had no criminal history as an adult, Howard County Police Chief Bill McMahon said at a Sunday press conference.

He said the troubled teen bought the gun used to commit the murders legally early in December.

McMahon
 revealed at the conference that investigators had seized a journal from
 the home of Aguilar which expressed unhappiness with his life.

The
 Prince George's County Police Department said it received a missing 
persons report for Aguilar at about 1:40 p.m. Saturday, more than two 
hours after the mall shooting.

Officers
 went to Aguilar's home to speak with his mother about 5 p.m. and saw 
Aguilar's journal. The portion the officer read made him concerned for 
Aguilar's safety, the department said.

Police began tracking Aguilar's phone and soon discovered it was at the mall.

Howard
 County Police Chief William McMahon said the journal expressed general 
unhappiness, but at that point, he did not give any specifics about the 
writings.

'There are a lot of unanswered questions,' McMahon said Sunday.

McMahon
 said the police investigation has not revealed any relationship between
 the victims and the shooter, but Benlolo and Aguilar lived close to one
 another.

'So far, our 
investigation has not shown a relationship. I'm not saying that it 
doesn't exist. We are focusing on any potential relationship, not one 
victim over the other,' he said.

McMahon
 said detectives have interviewed family and friends of the victims and 
the gunman but still do not have a motive for the crime.

The
 mall reopened for business on Monday, but McMahon said 'Nothing's going
 to go back to normal. This mall is going to be different because of 
what happened.'

Aguilar can been seen on surveillance footage arriving at the mall at 10:15 a.m.

He
 took a taxi to the Mall in Columbia in suburban Baltimore on Saturday 
morning and entered the building near Zumiez, a shop that sells 
skateboarding gear.

He 
went downstairs to a food court directly below the store, then returned 
less than an hour later, dumped the backpack in a dressing room and 
started shooting, police said.

His dumbfounded mother described him as 'a gentle, sweet kid' who has never been interested in guns.

'If
 you were to go in his room you would see what a gentle sweet kid he 
was,' she said, adding that he was a vegetarian because he was concerned
 about animal welfare.

'I 
don't know what happened, I really don't. It's so unusual, you can talk 
to any of his friends and find out what a gentle person he was.

'I
 don't know, he's never had a gun before, never been interested in guns 
or anything like that. I just don't know what happened, I just don't 
know what happened.'

The 
woman, who didn't give her name, told reporters she didn't believe her 
son knew his victims, contradicting earlier local radio reports that he 
had dated Benlolo.

'I feel for those other parents, I do,' she added, sobbing.

When
 asked if she knew he had bought the 12-gauge shotgun in December, she 
said: 'We have no guns in our house, we've never had guns in our house.'

The
 shooting baffled investigators and acquaintances of Aguilar, a quiet, 
skinny teenager who graduated from high school less than a year ago and 
had no previous run-ins with law enforcement. Police spent Sunday trying
 to piece together his motive, but it remained elusive.

Aguilar,
 who had concealed the shotgun in a bag, fired six to nine times. Victim
 Brianna Benlolo, lived half a mile away from Aguilar in the same 
College Park neighborhood, but police said they were still trying to 
determine what, if any, relationship they had.

The other employee, Tyler Johnson, did not know Aguilar and did not socialize with Benlolo outside of work, a relative said.

Although
 they lived close to Maryland's largest university, neither was a 
student there. Aguilar was accepted last February to Montgomery College,
 a community college in the Washington suburbs, but school spokesman 
Marcus Rosano said he never registered or attended.

His friend, Ellis Cropper, told ABC News that Aguilar worked at a local Dunkin Donuts where he'd just got a promotion and was planning on enrolling in college.

'Darion
 was a good kid,' he said. 'I don't know what happened ... Darion is 
quiet, kept to himself. Nice, normal, calm demeanor.'

The
 teen lived with his mother at a rented two-story wood-frame house in a 
middle-income neighborhood called Hollywood, just off U.S. Route 1.

A person who attended the high school with Aguilar told The Associated Press that he was an avid skateboarder.

Tydryn Scott, 19, said she was 
Aguilar's lab partner in science class and described him as tall, skinny
 and quiet. She said he was interested in skateboarding and hung out 
with other skaters.

She said she was stung by the news that he was the shooter.

'It
 was really hurtful, like, wow — someone that I know, someone that I've 
been in the presence of more than short amounts of time. I've seen this 
guy in action before. Never upset, never sad, just quiet — just chill,' 
Scott said. 'If any other emotion, he was happy, laughing.'
