Harassment: Walter Kershaw, 72, has admitted to stalking his ex for five years after she dumped him

A street artist dubbed ‘Britain’s original Banksy’ stalked his former partner for five years after she broke up with him.

Walter Kershaw, 72, admitted to harassing Catherine Mitchell with gifts and phone calls, leaving her fearing for her safety.

Celebrated painter Kershaw, of Littleborough, Rochdale, also admitted to stalking Ms Mitchell's mother after he became infatuated with her daughter.

Bury magistrates’ court heard how Kershaw would wait for Ms Mitchell and her mother Marjorie while they attended their local church and trail them around the supermarket.

He would also regularly turn up outside Mrs Mitchell’s house to get in touch with her daughter.

The court heard that Kershaw would blow the women kisses in the street and follow Ms Mitchell while muttering ‘you look beautiful today’ under his breath.

Kershaw and Ms Mitchell began a relationship several years ago, after she requested the artist paint her portrait, the court was told.

The relationship ended after 12 months when Ms Mitchell was involved in a serious accident, which left her with brain and leg injuries.

Robin Lynch, prosecuting, told the court that Ms Mitchell found Kershaw to be unpredictable and controlling during their relationship.

She also said he had been violent on a number of occasions, including one altercation where he slapped her.

In a statement read out in court, Ms Mitchell said: ‘I honestly believe he is capable of anything.

‘I worry for my own safety. From what he’s said to me I know he has no respect for authority. I want him to stop so I can live my life in peace.’

Kershaw admitted to being smitten with
Ms Mitchell but said he felt members of her family had been influencing
her decisions since the accident.

The court heard that he had promised faithfully to stop the harassment and said it would never happen again.

The
painter, who is a father to 11-year-old twins, reached international 
fame as a pioneer of street art and is still in work today painting 
large-scale, outdoor murals.

Paul Kidd, defending, said Kershaw had received verbal warnings from the police twice in 2009, and twice in 2010.

He suggested that if the police had gone further at this point, the harassment may have been stopped earlier.

In
a statement read out in court, Mrs Mitchell said that she and her 
daughter had been forced to cross the road and even plod across muddy 
fields to avoid Kershaw.

She added: ‘Since 2008, going into our town and attending church has been stressful. We want assurances that the years ahead are free from this predatory man so we can live our lives with freedom.’

District Judge Mark Hadfield said he was concerned the harassment had continued over such a long time.

He added: ‘It is worrying that despite numerous warnings from the police he doesn’t heed them. I would hope that at 72 he would understand that this relationship was over.’

The case has been adjourned for sentencing until December 16.
