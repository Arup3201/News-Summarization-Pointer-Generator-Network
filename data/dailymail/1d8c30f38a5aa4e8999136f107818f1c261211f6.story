A naked woman has been arrested at a massage parlor after police raided a Houston spa on Monday that was suspected of breaking licensing rules.

Casey Wright, 37, was charged with being nude in a business and failing to obtain a sexually oriented business permit.

A second woman, Juan Wei Fu, also faces charges of failing to obtain a sexually oriented permit, according to Harris County officials.

Crackdown: An undercover detective arrested the two women at Oasis Spa in Harris County

The pair were arrested during a compliance inspection, when an undercover detective visited the Oasis Spa near Ella Boulevard.

The officer was allegedly offered a massage, but claimed the spa and staff were not licensed to perform the service, according to the Houston Chronicle.

Harris County has been clamping down on unlicensed massage parlors for about two years, after more than 100 residents voiced concerns.

Stricter regulations banning sexually orientated businesses from operating within 1,500ft of schools, churches, day care centers and parks has driven the spas to the outskirts of the city.

'Weâ€™ve arrested every girl in a massage parlor, and the next day the business opens up again with a whole new set of girls,' Vice Squad agent Chris Montemayor told Your Houston News in 2011.

Wright is being held on $10,000 bond and Fu had her bond set at $1,000.
