The British sons of Guantanamo Bay detainee Shaker Aamer pleaded for his release yesterday – as his supporters marked the 13-year anniversary of his detention.

In their first interview, Mr Aamer’s young sons told how their hopes for their father’s freedom had been raised and dashed during years of delays in which he has twice been cleared for release.

The father-of-four has been held without charge in the notorious US-run detention camp for exactly 13 years today.

Shaker Aamer's young son Faris and Michael spoke of their hopes their father would be released from Guantanamo Bay soon

His youngest son Faris was born on the day Mr Aamer arrived at Guantanamo and has never met his father, whose case was raised by Prime Minister David Cameron during White House talks with Barack Obama last month. 

President Obama promised to treat it as a priority but Faris will today mark his 13th birthday without his father at his side.

He told Sky News: ‘It’s upsetting and quite shocking that I’ve never met him in my entire life.’

His older brother Michael, 15, said the family had hoped their ordeal was over when Mr Aamer was cleared for release, first by the Bush administration in 2007 and then by Mr Obama in 2009.

Michael said: ‘We thought there might be a chance for him to come home, but it just kept getting delayed.

‘We just felt more sad because nothing happened. We’ve seen other people with their parents… seen how they enjoy themselves, how they’re so close to them.

‘It’s like there is a part of our heart that is missing because we’ve been yearning for him to come home for many years and nothing’s happened yet.’

Mr Aamer has now been held at Guantanamo for 13 years without justice

Human rights campaigners Amnesty International have branded Mr Aamer’s 13-year detention without charge or trial as ‘disgraceful and inexcusable’.

Its chief executive Kate Allen said: ‘We keep being told that Shaker’s case is being “raised” or “prioritised”, but he’s still sitting in a cell in Cuba, 5,000 miles away from his family back here in Britain.

‘It’s abundantly clear that the US long ago gave up any pretence of bringing Shaker to justice. They must stop toying with this man’s life and put him on the first plane back to London.’

Saudi-born Mr Aamer moved to London almost 20 years ago and his wife and their four children are British citizens.

In 2001, he was detained in Afghanistan and he claims he was tortured at a secret ‘black site’ prison before he was sent to Guantanamo in February 2002.

Campaigners say he has been held in solitary confinement for long periods and that his mental and physical health have deteriorated, and that he has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

The US authorities say he is a terrorist with links to Al Qaeda but Mr Aamer has insisted he travelled to Afghanistan ahead of the 9/11 terror attacks to work for a humanitarian charity.

Guantanamo spokesman Lt Col Myles Caggins said: ‘In 2009 Shaker Aamer’s detention status was reviewed. As a result he was placed in a category we call “eligible for transfer”.

‘At some point in the future we will find a new home for him to be repatriated or resettled to.

‘We make these moves after a rigorous inter-agency process between our security officials, law enforcement and intelligence officials to ensure that transfer will be to a place that can maintain security assurances and human rights protections for those former Guantanamo detainees.’

Mr Aamer’s son Michael said: ‘I feel very sad because the man [Lt Col Caggins] said they were going to try to find him a home. But his home is here in London with his family.’

In recent years, the family have been able to communicate with Mr Aamer via Skype calls organised by the Red Cross.

His supporters, including Pink Floyd musician Roger Waters, took a giant Valentine’s card to the US Embassy in London to protest against his ongoing detention.

The card read ‘Please tell the President we want Shaker returned to his loved ones in London now’, and was signed by supporters including MPs, human rights campaigners and celebrities.

The US administration has said it is ‘aggressively pursuing’ the transfer of the remaining 122 Guantanamo inmates.

But the US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel, who must give the final authority to transfer any of the men, has confirmed Mr Aamer’s file has not crossed his desk.
