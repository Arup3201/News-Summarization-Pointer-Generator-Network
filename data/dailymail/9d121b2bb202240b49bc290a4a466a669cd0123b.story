Tara the cat, who saved a four-year-old boy from a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera is to 'throw first pitch' at a minor league baseball game next week.

The famous feline will be accompanied by her owner's son Jeremy at a Bakersfield Blaze home game at Sam Lynn Ballpark on Tuesday in Bakersfield, California.

On
 Wednesday, she became the nation's most beloved cat when surveillance 
footage emerged showing her saving their son Jeremy by pouncing on the 
neighbor's dog as it attacked him.

Tara the cat, who saved Jeremy, four, from a vicious dog attack that was caught on camera, threw the first pitch at a minor league baseball game

Yesterday Tara's owners said she has been best friends with Jeremy since he was born.

She followed Erica and Roger Triantafilo home from a park about six years ago and has been a member of the family ever since, they said.

On Thursday, Jeremy snoozed his way through his first live interview on the Today show as his parents described their shock at Tara's act of bravery.

'It's pretty amazing to see just a cat 
take on a dog and selflessly put herself out there,' Roger Triantafilo said. 'That dog did not 
even know what hit him.'

Erica explained that she had been near to the house watering a tree when the neighbor's dog, an eight-month-old male Labrador-Chow mix, escaped and grabbed her son by the leg.

'I'd never seen a dog just shake a child like that so violently,' she said. 'I just remember hearing him and the next thing I know, I see my cat flying out of nowhere and getting to this dog.'

Loved: The cat happily lets the little boy kiss her as he calls her a hero who saved him from a 'mean dog'

After the attack, Tara can be seen chasing the dog away before returning to Jeremy's side.

In an interview with the Bakersfield Californian,
 his family said she had always been protective over their oldest child 
and slept in his crib when he was a baby. They also have younger twin 
boys.

They added that Tara became part of the family in 2008 when she followed them home from a nearby park - and they accepted her into their home, even though Erica is allergic to cats.

She 'really just adopted us from there,' Mrs Triantafilo said.

They named her Tara after 'Zatara', which was the name given to Edmond Dantes in The Count of Monte Cristo by smugglers. They told him it means driftwood.

'We named her driftwood because she's our little cat that followed us home,' Triantafilo said. 'She's our little driftwood. She's amazing.'

She said that even though her three boys tug at Tara, she sits there and takes it.Â

To the rescue! Tara runs towards her owner as Scrappy shakes him. The dog was euthanized after continuing to show aggression during a 10-day assessment

'She's the most mellow cat you've ever seen,' she told Today. 'All our boys love her... and she loves them right back.'

The video had shown 
Jeremy sitting on his bicycle outside his family's home on Tuesday when 
the dog escaped its home through an open gate and crept up on him from 
behind.

Surveillance footage, which Jeremy's father uploaded to YouTube, shows the dog grabbing the boy's leg and pulling him to the ground before violently shaking him with his teeth clamped tight.

Then suddenly, an unlikely hero bounds towards him - the family's cat, Tara.

The
 video shows the fearless feline jumping on the dog with enough force to
 push him away from the boy. Tara then chases the dog away from the 
driveway with its leg between its tail.

And don't come back! Tara follows the dog to make sure it has left, before returning to check on Jeremy

The neighbor, who had been pulling out of their gated driveway when the dog escaped, called 911 for the boy and his mother, KERO reported.

The boy, who has mild autism, needed 1- stitches to the deep wounds on his legs but is otherwise fine.

'He's just bouncing back from this,' she told Today. 'He
 tells us it feels better.'

Speaking to Kero, he said: 'Tara is my hero!'

The dog was taken by Bakersfield Animal Control and could be rehabilitated at the neighbors' but home but also faces being euthanized.

Relief: Jeremy's parents, Erica and Roger, pictured, said they were relieved his injuries were not worse

The 
encounter was caught on surveillance cameras outside the home and 
uploaded to YouTube by the boy's father, Roger Triantafilo, on 
Wednesday.

'My cat 
defends my son during a vicious dog attack and runs the dog off before 
he can do additional damage,' Triantafilo wrote beneath the video. 
'Thankfully, my son is fine!'

The
 boy's mother said on Facebook: 'We aren't upset with our neighbors, 
we're just thankful our son wasn't injured more... Our cat is my hero!'

'Whoever said cats don't love their owners!' one YouTube viewer said.
