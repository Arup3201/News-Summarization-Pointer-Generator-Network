Stuart Gulliver, chief executive officer of HSBC Holdings Plc, is to be handed allowances worth £32,000-a-week to avoid the bonus cap imposed by Brussels

The boss of global banking giant HSBC 
is to be given allowances worth £32,000 a week, in addition to his salary of
 £1.2million, in a bid to avoid a bonus cap imposed on Brussels.

The
 bank was yesterday under fire for handing an £8million pay package, including bonuses, to 
its chief executive Stuart Gulliver in 2013 and giving £1million awards to 
239 staff – up from 204 in 2012 and 192 in 2011.

And
 it became the first bank to reveal detailed plans to avoid a bonus cap 
imposed by Brussels.

The bank is providing Mr Gulliver with a £1.7million 'fixed pay allowance', which will be paid in shares every three months in addition to his salary, The Guardian has reported.

This will mean he is paid at least £4.2million a year, compared to the £2.5million he earns now.

The shares, which cannot be sold for five years, will also be handed as allowances to 111 of the top bankers at HSBC.

Extra payments in cash are also expected to be handed to another 554 staff.

The EU rules 
introduced in January ban banks from paying bonuses of more than one 
year’s annual salary – or up to two years if shareholders approve.

Cathy
 Jamieson MP, a Labour Treasury spokesman, said: ‘We’re once again 
seeing bumper payouts with bonuses up this year at Lloyds, Barclays and 
now HSBC.

‘HSBC haven’t so 
much circumvented rules on bonuses as driven a coach and horses through 
them. The only way to rein in bankers’ remuneration is to make banks pay
 their fair share to society.’

Frances O’Grady of the Trades Union Congress said the payouts were another example of boardroom greed.

She
 added: ‘It would be great if banks put the same effort into lending to 
small businesses and investing in infrastructure as they do to getting 
round EU rules on boardroom bonuses.’

And
 Luke Hildyard of the High Pay Centre said: ‘HSBC are obviously not 
remotely bothered what ordinary people think. For all their bleating, 
the banks have not provided any evidence to prove that they would lose 
staff to rivals from outside the EU if pay and bonuses were reduced.'

Mr Gulliver has also sounded the death knell for traditional high street banking, after saying his staff will in future cater for ‘higher 
value activities’ such as mortgages and share trading instead of 
handling cash and cheque payments.

He also predicts that city areas will have the lion’s share of a reduced number of branches.

Insisting that most younger people bank online, he said: ‘You won’t be offering a branch walk-in facility for what can be described as a banking facility because the footfall won’t be there.

‘You will end up with a smaller number of branches than today but you will still have branches.

‘They will be in different parts of the country to reflect demographic changes that have taken place.’

The chief executive’s views sparked a furious reaction from campaigners, who accused HSBC of prioritising profitable customers and betraying its claim to be the world’s ‘local bank’.

Caroline Abrahams of Age UK said: ‘Being able to access your cash and pay bills are essential services which must be easily available to everyone.

‘The shrinking number of high street bank branches combined with the industry’s growing reliance on online services mean access has become  increasingly difficult for many older people.’

Over a third of pensioners have mobility problems that make travelling to their nearest branch difficult, according to the charity.

Derek French, of the Campaign for Community Banking Services, said: ‘HSBC has already been closing branches at a faster rate than its three main competitors in the UK and  leaving rural communities and market towns without any banking presence at all.

‘This disregard for the needs of 
vulnerable individuals and loyal small businesses on the part of HSBC, 
one of the world’s largest and most profitable banks, is appalling.

Barclays angered politicians and shareholders this month when it confirmed it had hiked its bonus pool by 10 per cent to £2.38billion, despite a fall in profits.

The Treasury has sided with the banks and launched a legal challenge against the EU pay curbs.

Announcing its latest financial results, HSBC posted a 9 per cent boost in profits to £13.6billion last year.

It has set aside an extra £450million in the final three months of the year to compensate customers mis-sold PPI, taking its total bill for the scandal so far to £1.9billion. The banking group, which owns the First Direct and M&S Bank, has 16million customers in the UK and 1,150 branches. It closed 47 last year.

Mr Gulliver is the latest financier to fuel fears that branches will become much less common on high streets.

This month Antony Jenkins, who is chief executive of Barclays, was criticised for claiming that shutting down branches and moving more customers to online banking would lead to a ‘better customer experience’.

There are fears that up to a quarter of his bank’s 1,560 branches are under threat.
