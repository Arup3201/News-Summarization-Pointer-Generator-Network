Internacional have confirmed the signing of Manchester United flop Anderson on a four-year contract. 

United have cancelled Anderson's contract to allow the midfielder to join his hometown club in a deal understood to be worth £25,000 per week after tax.

Anderson ended up costing United £25.7million after Sir Alex Ferguson signed him from Porto in 2007, and made a total of 181 appearances for the club during his eight years at Old Trafford.

2015-NOW: Internacional (0, 0) 

Anderson was back in his native Porto Alegre on Monday to undergo a medical before the signing was confirmed the day after by the Internacional's official website.

They wrote: 'The Sport Club Internacional concluded on Tuesday (03/02) the procedures to announce the signing of midfielder Anderson. He signs four-year contract.

'The official presentation will be at 18 hours, in the conference room of the Beira-Rio stadium.'

United had hoped Anderson would grow as a player  but his time in Manchester proved disappointing. It quickly became apparent he would not feature in Louis van Gaal's plans.

Anderson's final appearance for United was for their under-21 side as they beat Liverpool 2-1 at Leigh Sports Village in the U21 Barclays Premier League.

On leaving United, the midfielder took to Instagram to say goodbye.

'Thank you so much to Manchester United It is truly the best club in the world, I love it so much and have enjoyed every year I have spent there,' he wrote.

'Thank you to all the team who work at United and especially all the boys, I have made some amazing friends, all of whom are great players and will continue to do great things. 

'And one massive thank you to all of the fans, for your continuos love.. The best.' [sic]
