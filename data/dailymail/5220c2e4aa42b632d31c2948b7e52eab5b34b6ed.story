Senior Tories last night warned David Cameron of the dangers of state regulation of Britain’s free Press ahead of the publication of the Leveson report on media standards next month.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said that Britain’s international reputation was due, in part, to a vibrant Press exposing corruption and incompetence.

And John Whittingdale, Tory chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee, warned he would not support any statutory restrictions on newspapers and websites.

He criticised the Government for giving Lord Justice  Leveson too broad a remit and expressed concern that the inquiry looks unlikely ever to examine the culture of phone hacking at the News of the World – which triggered the inquiry in the first place – because of  criminal investigations.

Both were speaking to mark the launch of the Free Speech Network, a campaign which argues that a vibrant free Press is essential to any democracy.

The Government is preparing to receive the Leveson report, amid growing speculation that it may recommend at least a ‘backstop’ in law to a new system of media regulation.

Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to push ministers to accept whatever Lord Justice Leveson recommends.

But there is growing alarm among senior Tories.

Mr Johnson said: ‘One of the reasons London is regarded as the greatest city on Earth to live and invest in is because we have the stability that goes with, not just the rule of law, but a system of government that is almost entirely free from corruption and criminal activity, at virtually every level.

And that is very largely thanks to the free, dynamic, irreverent and independent media that we have and is one of the glories of this country.

‘We have got to fight to keep it that way.’

Mr Whittingdale, whose committee conducted its own inquiries into phone hacking, told an event in Westminster: ‘We should hold back from statutory regulation.

'At the end of the day this matter is so important it should be Parliament that decides what to do, not a judge – however eminent.’

He told the audience he believed statutory regulation would be ‘incredibly dangerous’ and urged Lord Justice Leveson to give a ‘chance to the much stronger independent regulatory body being established’ by the industry.

He said the new regulator would have the ‘teeth’ lacking from the Press Complaints Commission. ‘We should give the body a chance and we will step in if it’s not seen to be doing a good job, but I don’t want to legislate now because I think that represents a step that’s incredibly dangerous,’ he added.

‘The suggestion newspapers might be held back from a legitimate investigative role would be a considerable danger.’

The MP also claimed that it was clear the terms of reference of the Leveson Inquiry were ‘too wide’.

And he expressed concern that the two main issues – how the News of the World allowed journalists to tap into mobile phone voicemails and why the police failed to act – appeared unlikely to be examined because of criminal inquiries.

Tim Luckhurst, professor of journalism at Kent University, insisted that a new regulatory Press body must be independent from Government, Parliament and the state.

He told the event, attended by campaigners for state regulation of the Press, including comedian Steve Coogan, that any form of Government  intervention would give succour to dictators in countries such as Zimbabwe who seek to shackle free speech.

In the House of Lords yesterday, however, several Labour peers urged tighter regulation.

Witness: Actress Sienna Miller was among a host of public figures who gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry

Lord
Sugar, host of The Apprentice, said erring journalists should be barred
‘from practising their profession in the same way a lawyer or  doctor 
would be struck off if they had acted improperly’.

Lord
Stevenson of Balmacara, a shadow minister and former aide to Gordon 
Brown, said: ‘Labour supports a strong and free Press that can hold 
politicians to account, which is essential in a democracy, but a strong 
and free Press must have responsibilities too.

‘Most
other professions including judges are regulated and there don’t seem 
to be many problems there. It is unhealthy for any industry to be its 
own judge and jury.’

Viscount Younger of Leckie, a Government minister, said the status quo was ‘not an option’.

‘As
the Prime Minister has recently commented: We don’t want heavy-handed 
state intervention but the status quo is not an option,’ he told peers.

Steven
Barnett, professor of communications at Westminster University, said 
the proposals for self-regulation put forward by Lord Hunt and Lord 
Black sounded ‘admirable’, but that it had to be underpinned by legislation to ensure that publishers could be held to account.  Professor Barnett said Press freedom had to be weighed 
against the rights of individuals.

Professor
Barnett was part of the advisory committee for the Media Standard Trust’s 
submission to the Leveson Inquiry.
