A group of mothers staged a nurse-in at their local Friendly's this weekend after one woman was asked to cover up while breastfeeding her eight-week-old daughter there.

Tabitha Donohue of Norwich, Connecticut, told Fox CT that she was dining at the fast food restaurant on Friday and nursing her daughter Rune when a manager approached her to say she was making the other customers uncomfortable.

'Management came over and told me to cover it up or stop feeding her,' she explained. 'And I told them I didn't want to do either of those things.'

Protest: A group of mothers staged a nurse-in at their local Friendly's this weekend after one mom, Tabitha Donue (right) was asked to cover up while breastfeeding her eight-week-old daughter there

Group effort: On Saturday afternoon, about 50 mothers accompanied by their spouses and other family members brought their babies to the restaurant, where they proceeded to breastfeed

Liz Linehan, a mother-of-three from Cheshire, Connecticut, read about the incident on Facebook and helped Ms Donahue organize a nurse-in to protest the restaurant's attitude toward breastfeeding.

She was motivated to take a stand after reading some hurtful comments on Facebook. 'There were a ton of responses saying that nursing moms are just trying to get attention and that we're vulgar and that nursing is pornographic,' she said.

So on Saturday afternoon, about 50 mothers accompanied by their spouses and other family members brought their babies to the restaurant, where they proceeded to breastfeed.

Other supporters lined the streets carrying signs that read: 'I make milk. What's your super power?'

Incident: Ms Donohue was nursing her daughter Rune on Friday when a manager approached her and said she was making the other customers uncomfortable

Know the law: The issue arose because the Friendly's employee was not aware of a state law that requires no restrictions or limitations may be placed on a mother's right to breastfeed a child

Change of attitude: 'In America, there's been an over-sexualized culture of the breasts,' said Liz Linehan, who helped organize the nurse-in. 'We have to remember, breasts are made for feeding babies'

In it together: Mothers sit on a the curb nursing outside Friendly's

It seems the issue arose because the Friendly's employee was not aware of a state law that says no restrictions or limitations may be placed on a mother's right to breastfeed a child.

'Unfortunately, the manager didn't know anything about the law,' explained Ms Linehan, adding that society's perception of nursing is at fault.

'In America, there's been an over-sexualized culture of the breasts. We have to remember, breasts are made for feeding babies.'

Take a stand: Some supporters lined the streets carrying signs that read: 'I make milk. What's your super power?'

Upsetting: Ms Linehan said when she read about Ms Donahue's experience on Facebook, 'there were a ton of responses saying that nursing moms are just trying to get attention and that nursing is pornographic'

Friendly's has since issued a statement that reads: 'We are a family restaurant and want all of our guests to be comfortable while dining with us.

'We honor each state's laws and welcome all breastfeeding moms and their children. We enjoyed serving all the moms who came into our Norwich restaurant today.

'We will use this as an opportunity to train all of our team members in Norwich, and all of our restaurants, as to how to appropriately accommodate breastfeeding Moms.'
