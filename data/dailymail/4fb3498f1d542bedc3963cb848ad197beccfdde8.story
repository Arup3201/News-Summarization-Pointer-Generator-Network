Furious people took to Facebook to vent their anger over the recent profiling of shoppers in the New York retailer, Barneys.

This comes as a fourth person has come forward with similar claims, this time against Macy's - the second in a week.

Art Palmer says four plainclothes cops questioned him three blocks away from the flagship store after he bought $320 worth of Polo dress shirts and ties in April.

The latest accusation echoes those by Trayon Christian and Kayla Phillips against Barneys and by actor Robert Brown against the same Macy’s.

Palmer, a 56-year-old exercise trainer from Crown Heights, Brooklyn, said he made the purchase without incident, using both his Macy’s platinum card and his American Express card.

He was walking to a gym on Park Avenue when police surrounded him and demanded to see his ID.

The officers said they were suspicious because they had lost sight of him on the store’s surveillance cameras, he said.

When asked if he believed he was racially profiled, he told the New York Daily News that there was 'no other reason'.

He was allowed to continue on his way after he showed his receipt for the duds and the cards with which he purchased them.

When Palmer returned to the store the next day to complain, a Macy’s manager blamed it on the cops and said officers frequently come into the store to monitor surveillance videos without permission, according to Palmer.

Two black Barneys customers said this week they were detained by police after making expensive purchases, while last week actor Robert Brown said he was paraded through Macy’s Herald Square store in handcuffs and detained for an hour after being racially profiled and accused of using a stolen credit card to buy his mother a $1,350 watch.

Brown, one of the stars of HBO show Treme, was released after being in cuffs for about 45 minutes without any charges.

He’s suing the store and the NYPD, charging cops racially profiled him and violated his constitutional rights.

Fashion megastar Tyson Beckford, 42, told PIX11 on Thursday that he frequently gets judged on the color of his skin in Barney's and other places.

'I
 might have the most recognizable face in the world. I still get 
followed all the time, any time I go to a store,' Beckford said outside 
Barney's.

Kayla Phillips, 21, 
said she was surrounded and interrogated by police after purchasing a 
$2,500 handbag from Barneys in February.

On Barneys' Facebook wall, users have posted their opinions, said the New York Daily News.

'Love these shoes ... but having dark skin, my hard earned money may not be enough to allow the purchase at this establishment,’ Facebook user Amelia Rios Alex wrote on the page, which features glitzy photos of shoes, perfume, jewelry and apparel.

Barneys' menswear ad was bombarded with angry comments

An ad for a John Varvatos suit with the tagline, Modern Monochrome, attracted 72 people to vent about the profiling scandal.

‘Modern racism,' said John Renaud.

‘Monochrome is right. Whites only’, according to David Nieves.

‘Will I get arrested if I buy this?’ asked Ramona Morgan.

‘Do handcuffs [come] with this or are they sold separately?’ said Facebook user Glenny Lennox.

Civil rights activist Reverend Al Sharpton has
 threatened protests against Barneys and a possible 
boycott for 'upscale racial profiling'.

'In major cities like New York, blacks 
and Latinos not only worry about being “stopped-and-frisked” by police, 
but they also fear the embarrassment of being “shopped-and-frisked” in 
retail stores,' he said in an opinion piece for the New York Daily News.

'Perhaps
 all retailers need a friendly reminder of the immense buying power of 
blacks and minorities. We will definitely remember those who welcome us 
and those who would rather profile us, and we will speak loudly with our
 dollars — bottom line.'

we 
ever naively believe that our work is done?' Sharpton wrote.

Time for action:The Rev. Al Sharpton has condemned 'shop and frisk' at Manhattan stores and called for a boycott of Barneys

Sharpton said it was a 'travesty' that police and retailers interrogate black people who buy expensive items.

'Barneys,
 a high-end retailer with stores in major cities, must answer for this 
pattern of biased behavior, as must the NYPD,' he wrote.

'Our
 National Action Network (NAN) Brooklyn chapter President Kirsten John 
Foy said it best when he called Barneys’ behavior schizophrenic. On the 
one hand, they want to expand their brand to the urban market, but then 
they turn around and see us as suspects rather than prospects.

'Barneys
 and other retailers that openly discriminate against us must be held 
accountable. Simply apologizing isn’t enough; we need to see a plan of 
action as to how they are going to rectify their ways.'

Sharpton has demanded
 a meeting with Barneys CEO, Mark Lee, and is 'currently mobilizing 
activists for peaceful direct-action against the store and the NYPD.'

Earlier this week, Lee said the company had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures and offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies'.

'Barneys
 New York has zero tolerance for any form of discrimination and we stand
 by our long history in support of all human rights,' Barneys said in a 
statement.

In his comment piece, Sharpton also highlighted the experiences of 'Treme' actor, Rob Brown, and Oscar-winning actor Forest Whitaker.

Brown claimed he was paraded through 
Macy’s Herald Square in handcuffs and placed in a holding cell because 
an employee suspected that his credit card didn’t belong to him in June,

Whitaker said he was accused of stealing and patted down after leaving a store in Morningside Heights.

'When international celebrities can be 
disrespected and mistreated in such a humiliating manner, how can we 
ever naively believe that our work is done?' Sharpton wrote.
