A bee attack during a baseball game in Utah forced players and spectators to flee, sending one man to the hospital and injuring several others.

St. George Fire Capt. Robert Hooper says the man was stung between 200 and 300 times late Friday morning at Elk's Field in St. George.

But he told the Deseret News the man didn't exhibit any signs of a severe reaction, and was alert and talking to emergency responders. 

Hooper said an established underground beehive near a telephone pole at the baseball field was disturbed just after 11 a.m.

Attack: One man was seriously injured and several other people received minor injuries when over 1,000 bees swarmed Elks Field in St. George, Utah, about 11am Friday after their underground hive was disturbed

The victim's name wasn't immediately released, however he is said to be in his eighties, according toKCSG.

Several other people were treated for stings at the scene.

Lone Peak High School baseball coach Matt Bezzant told The Spectrum newspaper of St. George that the bees came from a dugout and players were chased by as many as 70 bees at one point.

Fire crews doused the dugout area with a chemical foam to combat the bees. 

It's not known exactly what caused the bees to become so aggressive but fire officials say it's not uncommon for bees to begin migrating and colonizing at this time of year

Plugging holes: It appears the bees came from an underground hive that was somehow disturbed

Emergency: Fire crews were able to kill the bees using a special chemical foam and water

Casey Lofthouse, a local beekeeper and a member of the Washington County Search and Rescue team, told the St. George News that 'bees will protect their home'.

'Both Africanized or European honeybees will protect their hives. The main difference is that the Africanized bees are more aggressive,' he added.

Lofthouse said in the event of a swarm of bees, cover your head and neck as best as possible and vacate the area, preferably going indoors.   

Back to it: After the emergency, the baseball was able to reconvene
