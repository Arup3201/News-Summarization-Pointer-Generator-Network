'Monster': Samuel Cabrera, 27, is accused of murdering his 3-month-old son by beating the child to death

A Philadelphia man has been arrested after police say he beat his 3-month-old son to death and then tried to make it look like an accident.

Samuel Cabrera, 27, has been charged with murder in the death of Samuel Cabrera Jr, who passed away after suffering a slew of internal injuries.

Last Tuesday, the toddler was rushed from his family's home in the 600 block of North 63rd Street to the Children's Hospital in critical condition.

Doctors say all of the boy's internal organs had been crushed, and the toddler also had two broken bones and a ruptured spleen, NBC News reported.

When Mr Cabrera and the victim’s mother had been questioned by police, the couple's stories did not match up.

The mother, who has not been charged in the killing, allegedly told investigators that she and her boyfriend found little Samuel pale and unconscious. According to the woman, the boy suffered bruises after she and Cabrera pounded on his chest while performing CPR.

The 27-year-old father, however, offered a different version of events, telling police that he was trying to get the family dog off he coach when he accidentally hit the baby.

NBC 10 sources claimed that Cabrera eventually confessed to killing the boy.

Besides little Samuel, the couple have been living with Cabrera's 15-year-old daughter and his girlfriend’s three children from a previous relationship. All four children are currently staying with relatives.

Detectives say they spotted bruises on the suspect’s teenage daughter and are now trying to determine if she was also abused by her father.

Mr Cabrera is due in court for a preliminary hearing May 1.

Heartbreaking outcome: Little Samuel passed away at the Children's Hospital from what doctors described as crushed internal organs and ruptured spleen
