Arsenal have been given a boost after QPR manager Harry Redknapp admitted that in-demand striker Loic Remy wants to move to a club playing Champions League football.

The France international has attracted interest from a host of Premier League clubs including  Liverpool, Tottenham and Newcastle - where he spent a successful loan spell scoring 14 goals in 26 games for the club last season.

Despite QPR's return to the top-flight, Redknapp accepts that the 27-year-old - who is understood to be available for £8million - is likely to be playing elsewhere next season.

'I think he really wants to play Champions League football next year somewhere,' Redknapp told talkSPORT.

'We gave him time off after the World Cup but I think he’s really looking to move. I would be surprised if he was at QPR at the start of the year.

'If he goes to the right team, he’s capable of scoring 15 to 20 Premier League goals next season.'

'If nothing comes along I'm sure he will be back here. He had a contract, a good
contract, here.'

In-demand: Loic Remy's successful loan at Newcastle has attracted interest from Arsenal and Liverpool

Arsenal have long been considered favourites to land the forward but have reportedly failed to match his personal terms.

Meanwhile, Liverpool have expressed an interest in the striker and have money to spend following the £75million sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

Tottenham would also rival their North London rivals for his signature since Spurs’ chief talent-spotter Ian 
Broomfield, who played a key role in bringing Remy to Loftus Road, is a 
long term admirer of the striker and has recommended the 
club launch a move.
