Tottenham's move for Mateo Musacchio is being complicated by a row over his economic rights and percentage sell-on.

Mauricio Pochettino has identified the Argentina international centre-back as a potential signing and talks are underway over a deal.

However, his former club River Plate are in dispute with Villarreal not just over Musacchio but over deals involving other young players. Villarreal own 35 percent of the player, River Plate have 35 per cent and his agent has 30 per cent.

Wanted: Tottenham are closing in on a deal for Mateo Musacchio, who is rated at £20million

Villarreal have tried to buy out River Plate's percentage before but the Argentine club have not budged.

As a result, Villarreal want at least £21million from Tottenham to cover the cost of replacing the 23-year-old.

President Fernando Roig does not wish to lose the defender but Musacchio has had his head turned by the prospect of playing for countryman Mauricio Pochettino and a salary which would almost treble his current £20,000 a week.

Tottenham have interest from Lazio in Younes Kaboul, 28, but are yet to receive a formal bid, they will listen to offers for Michael Dawson while Vlad Chiriches, who has attracted interest from Roma, is one of the names being proposed to Southampton as a potential makeweight in a deal for French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin.

Tottenham, meanwhile, have no interest in free agent striker Samuel Eto'o.
