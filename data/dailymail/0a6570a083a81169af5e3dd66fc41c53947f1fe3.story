A 78-year-old woman who was reported missing after she failed to show up to an event at a nearby library was found stuck in quicksand, authorities said.

Grand County sheriff's deputies said the woman had water and was in good condition when she was found the night of July 9, about 14 hours after one of her legs sank up to the knee.

Deputies said they searched a bike path at the Courthouse Wash in Arches National Park, where the woman was known to walk.

Investigators found her car in a 
parking area first, then heard her calling out to them and discovered 
her about a quarter mile up the wash.

Sharon
 Brussell, who works at Arches, said about four people helped dig her 
out and struggled because the quicksand kept filling back in.

The woman was tired but 'extremely grateful' for rescuers, who carried her up to her car in a litter, Brussell said.

It's
 rare to get stuck in quicksand, but it can happen when sandy areas 
become saturated with water, said Brussell, who recalled a similar 
rescue involving a stuck cow.
