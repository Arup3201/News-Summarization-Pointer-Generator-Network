An Asda customer  found a rat's head inside a bag of frozen spinach as she was cooking dinner for her mother.

Terri Powis noticed something unusual protruding from the greens as she began steaming a batch for her and her 60-year-old mother to have with their chicken dinner.

The 33-year-old soon discovered the foreign object was the 'fresh, pink' head of a rodent, wrapped in a clump of green leaves.

The 33-year-old only made the discovery of the 'fresh, pink' head as she was steaming the spinach for dinner

She said: 'It didn't even cross my mind that it was the head of a rat. I was poking around with it because I didn't know what it was. 

Ms Powis bought the vegetables from her local Asda store in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire

'I was gobsmacked when I realised what it was - it was horrible.

'It was very fresh and really pink. It was a bit squashed but intact and must have been frozen soon after being severed.'

Ms Powis, an accounts assistant, had bought the 98p Asda-branded bag of whole leaf spinach from her local branch in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire.  

After the discovery on January 19, she phoned Asda to complain and received an apology.

But she claims the chain did not take her complaint seriously.

She said: 'The way they handled it was like it happened every day.

'They said sorry but it was just a "yeah, bring it back to the store". I felt it should have been dealt with more seriously.'

Wycombe District Council has been notified and is now investigating the incident.

An Asda spokesman said: 'We'd like to apologise for any upset caused to Ms Powis, and we will work closely with the local authorities whilst they conduct their investigation.'
