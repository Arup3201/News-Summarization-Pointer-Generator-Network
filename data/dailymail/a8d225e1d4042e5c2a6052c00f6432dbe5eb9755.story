A father is launching a landmark legal battle against Facebook after suggestive photographs of his 12-year-old daughter allegedly appeared on the website.

In the ground-breaking writ, he claims that ‘photographic images and literary content’ on the site have put his daughter in danger of being targeted by paedophiles.

If his claim is successful, the  company – which is valued at £17.5billion – could face a massive compensation payout.

Facebook, which has more than 750million users across the world, requires its members to be over 13, but relies on children to be truthful about their age and doesn’t ask for verification.

Last night the girl’s father, who cannot be named in order to protect his daughter’s identity, revealed his fears that she may be enticed to run away by sex abusers who use the social networking site. He told how one picture of the girl lifting her top had been removed, but said another showing her wearing a low-cut top and make-up is still visible.

In the writ, filed last night, he warns he will seek an injunction ordering Facebook to close down her account and to take steps to ensure she isn’t able to open another account.

If that doesn’t happen, he will seek an injunction to stop Facebook operating in Northern Ireland.

The writ says the site is ‘guilty of negligence’ and has created ‘a risk of sexual and physical harm’ to the vulnerable child.

It also claims she has received text messages of an inappropriate nature from adult men who were asking her to post sexual messages and photographs of herself on Facebook.

The child from Country Antrim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, is in care and suffers from behavioural problems. She allegedly posted the photographs and sexually explicit material on the site herself, giving personal details of her life, including the area where she lives and the school she attends.

Her father said: ‘I’m taking this case against Facebook as a last resort. I was horrified when I saw the photographs my daughter had posted of herself on the site.

‘She is far too young to understand what she is doing. She suffers  problems and engages in self-destructive behaviour. She is currently receiving counselling.’

The girl’s father claimed her current profile picture on Facebook was sexually suggestive, adding: ‘She is wearing make-up and a low-cut top. It’s completely inappropriate to show such a picture of a 12-year-old.

‘I am worried sick even thinking about the danger she could be in. There was another picture on Facebook of my daughter lifting up her top but thankfully that has been removed.’

The man also revealed his daughter had a history of running away. ‘She has done so several times,’ he explained. ‘Once she was found in a derelict house. My grave concern is that she would go off with someone she met on Facebook.’

The father’s solicitor, Hilary Carmichael, has set up Childrenonfacebook.com, a website for parents who believe their youngsters may be at risk on the social network.

She said: ‘I believe Facebook isn’t suitable for under-18s but the company isn’t even able to uphold its own policy of keeping under-13s out. If a child goes into an off-licence to buy alcohol or a shop to buy cigarettes, they’re asked for ID to prove their age.

‘Yet a child can join Facebook – and be exposed to a bigger population than that of the entire EU – without any ID being requested. An age check, like asking for a passport number, would be a simple measure to implement.’

The writs lodged in Belfast High Court are against Facebook Ireland and Facebook headquarters in California. A writ has also been lodged against the health and social care trust in whose care the girl is residing. It alleges that the trust has been negligent for failing to prevent the child accessing Facebook.
