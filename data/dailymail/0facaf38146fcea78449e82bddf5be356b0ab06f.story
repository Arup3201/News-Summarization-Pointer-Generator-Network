With an average cost of Â£5,000 for a breast implant operation in Britain, it's perhaps unsurprising that 43 per cent of people say they would travel abroad to have cosmetic surgery.

But the risks associated with surgery abroad can be huge, as Claire Hawker, a 29-year-old beauty therapist from Reading, discovered.

Hoping to get a bargain boob job, she travelled to Prague in the Czech Republic in 2009 but was left implants that became so badly infected that part of her own breast tissue was eaten away.

Agony: Claire Hawker, 29, from Reading, was left in excruciating pain after a budget boob job went wrong

'Flying to Prague, I was very confident and happy about the surgery I was going to have,' she explains.

But her confidence didn't last long. On arriving at the clinic, she found that the surgeon could barely speak English and offered only a minimal consultation.

'He just said, "What size would you like to go?", and I said a couple of sizes bigger and I'd like an uplift. So he drew the lines and said, "See you in an hour".

'I did have doubts but I just wanted nice breasts and I thought it would all be fine.'

But when Ms Hawker woke up from the operation, she found herself in excruciating pain.

Nevertheless, a few days after surgery, she flew home - without raising the issue with her surgeon.

'I definitely felt something wasn't right
 when I got on the plane,' she adds. By the time she reached home, the pain had become extreme and disaster was about to strike.

Falling out: According to Claire's mother Jan, it appeared as if the infected implants were falling out

Operation: Since the botched boob job, Claire has had to have six different operations to repair her bust

'I got them out [to show friends and family] and they all were saying, 
"Oh wow, they're so nice" and then suddenly, this stuff started leaking 
out of my left boob.'

'She pulled her top up and I'm not a 
surgeon, but I'm 99 per cent sure the implants were falling out,' adds Ms Hawker's mother, Jan Coker.

'They 
were green, awful, heartbreaking. I'd never seen anything so ugly.'

Horrified, Mrs Coker rushed her daughter straight to hospital where she saw a plastic surgeon who immediately decided to remove the implants.

With infections raging through both breasts, it took another four operations before her breasts began to heal and another two months before the wounds sealed up.

'The surgeon said, "You could have died if you'd just ignored it,"' adds Ms Hawker. '[Afterwards], my boobs looked ugly and I just thought my whole body looked ugly... I hated it.'

Beautiful: Czech capital Prague is the perfect spot for a holiday but apparently not for boob jobs

'The moral of this story, really, is that I would caution people about going abroad to have boob jobs,' comments leading plastic and reconstructive surgeon, Dr Nick Percival.

'Most people 
who go abroad know nothing about the person doing the operation and 
that's very dangerous. So you might be saving money but you might have 
to spend a lot more in the long run.'

For Ms Hawker, the consequences of her budget boob job included uneven breasts, with the left smaller than the right after the infection ate away her breast tissue.

The bungled operation also left her Â£4,000 out-of-pocket and facing the prospect of another two operations, one to even up her breasts and another to reduce the scarring.

Four years on and several operations later, Ms Hawker is almost healed and insists she won't make the same mistake again.

With one last operation to go, she adds: 'This is the last bit now... It's just been a roller coaster!'

One that she, happily, will soon be able to get off.
