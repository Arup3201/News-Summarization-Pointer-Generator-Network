A picture of a woman who was charged with assaulting a police officer after she squirted breast milk at her during a strip search has emerged.

Perth's Erica Leeder appeared in Fremantle Magistrates Court on Wednesday and will remain in jail after she was not grant bail, 9News reported.

Western Australia police allege the 26-year-old took hold of her breast and squirted milk on to the female officer who was performing the strip search on Leeder.

Erica Leeder, 26, was charged after she squirted breast milk at a female police officer during a strip search

The milk hit the officer on the forehead, arms and clothing while Leeder was naked from the waist up, according to Perth Now.

The alleged incident occurred while the officer was rearranging clothes on Leeder's body.

It was confirmed to Daily Mail Australia Leeder was arrested about midday on Tuesday in relation to an outstanding warrant before she was taken to Rockingham police station, about 50 kilometres from Perth.

She was then charged with assaulting a public officer. 

It is alleged Leeder covered the female officer's face, arms and uniform in milk during the alleged incident

She was not granted bail and a mental health assessment will be carried out on Leeder 

The magistrate did not grant her request for bail because she had previously assaulted another police officer.

A mental health assessment will be carried out on her and she will return to court next week.

If she is convicted, Leeder could be jailed for up to 18 months or fined $18,000. 

Posts on Leeder's Facebook page paint a picture of a woman who loves and is devoted to her children.

She is seen posing in many photos with a baby boy.
