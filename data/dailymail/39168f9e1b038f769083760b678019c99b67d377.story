Diego Maradona’s lovelife appears to have taken a turn for the better as he was filmed serenading his girlfriend in Dubai.

The legendary footballer sang an impromptu love song to his on-off partner Rocio Oliva, 24, during a product launch.

This comes just two weeks after a video emerged appearing to show the 54-year-old physically assaulting Ms Oliva.

Bizarre: Diego Maradona interrupted a product launch to serenade his 24-year-old on-again girlfriend

Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’.

Maradona, whose infamous Hand of God goal helped Argentina knocked England out of the 1986 World Cup, then looks lovingly at Ms Oliva, whom he has been dating on and off since the beginning of last year.

The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone.

Ms Oliva secretly filmed the 53-year-old walking towards her spluttering: 'You still looking at your phone.'

She retorted: 'Can't I look at it?' before begging him: 'Stop Diego, calm down, stop hitting.' as he allegedly tried to strike her twice with his right hand.

Forgive and forget: The 54-year-old seemed to have patched things up with his young love following the release of a video where Ms Oliva secretly filmed what appeared to be Maradona assaulting her

It's back on: Maradona decided to pull the bizarre stunt while on stage in the UAE to promote a sports drink, claiming afterwards it was ‘part of the show’

The serenade follows the disturbing 30-second video which allegedly shows Maradona hitting the 24-year-old after becoming upset over her using her mobile phone 

The video was broadcast on a lunchtime TV programme in Argentina, after which the Hand of God insisted he had only knocked the phone out of her hands.

He told a journalist: 'I sent the phone flying but I swear I've never hit a woman. The story starts and finishes there.

'I admit I knocked the phone out of Rocio's hands but there's nothing more to it. The situation didn't continue.'

Maradona and Ms Oliva have broken up and reunited several times during the course of their relationship, and the couple were even engaged for a short time before breaking it off.

In May last year Maradona allegedly had a row with her on an airplane that got so heated that fellow business class travellers and air stewardesses allegedly had to step in to try to get him to calm down.

In July this year, Ms Oliva was arrested in Brazil after Maradona accused her of stealing watches and jewellery worth nearly £250,000 from his mansion in Dubai.
