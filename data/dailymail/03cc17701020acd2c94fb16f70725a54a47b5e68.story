Two boys who died in a house fire thought to have been started by their father have been described as 'a shining light' at a funeral service attended by hundreds of people.

Talented musician Jack Sykes, 12, and his aspiring athlete brother Paul, nine, died after a blaze at their father's home in Penistone, South Yorkshire, last month.

Today, family and friends packed St John's Church, in the Pennine town, and scores more braved atrocious weather outside to form a 'circle of love' in the churchyard.

The funeral of tragic brothers Paul, nine and Jack, 12 Sykes of Penistone, South Yorkshire, has taken place at St John the Baptist Church in Penistone. Pictured is the boy's mother Claire Sykes

There was silence and tears in the town centre as the two white coffins, one slightly smaller than the other, were carried into the church with the boys' mother, Claire Sykes, 42, leading mourners behind.

During the funeral she was led to the matching coffins and rested her hands on each for a moment, and bowing her head.

The hour-long service had no hymns, but was instead packed with tributes, stories and songs, including 'Sing' by Gary Barlow, 'Wonderful World' by Louis Armstrong and 'I Had A Dream' by Abba

'Yes, Jack and Paul's lives were cut short but I think we'd be doing both them and Claire a disservice if they were to be remembered for the tragic nature of their death,' Andy Platt, the head of Springvale Primary School - where Paul was a pupil and Jack a former pupil - told the congregation.

'Instead, let's try and remember the shining light that was their lives.'

The two boys' coffins are taken into church. The head of their primary school said: 'They were children who stood out, children who other could take a lead from'

He added: 'In many ways he was a marvellous role model for all his peers, Jack was a friend to everyone and everyone's friend.

'He had a real passion for music and was a standout trumpet player.

'He clearly had a lot of natural talent but it was his commitment, his hard work and his practice that allowed him to make the most of his talent.'

He described Paul as a talented athlete who showed a real aptitude for running and won many medals.

Mr Platt said: 'He was a character was Paul, he was a joker and a real enthusiast.

'He was a really powerful role model to his peers, dealing with victory and any disappointment with dignity

Firefighters paid their respects at the funeral, struggling to contain their emotions

Their primary school head teacher said: 'Let's try and remember the shining light that was their lives'

'For different reasons Paul and Jack were children with a high profile in school, they were children who stood out, children who others could take a lead from.

'They were two terrific boys.'

Speaking of their mother, he said: 'Claire is a lady of great fortitude and empathy and her children were built in the same mould.'

As requested many members of the funeral party and mourners came dressed in bright colours - Ms Sykes, 42, wore a patterned dress and red cardigan.

Jo Higgins, principal at Penistone Grammar School ALC, said there were so many pupils and teachers who wanted to attend the service today it wasn't logistically possible - so they held a simultaneous service at the school.

Ms Higgins read out many memories of Jack from fellow pupils and became emotional at the end of her tribute.

The teachers were met with a round of applause when they finished.

Jo Hamer, the boys' aunt, regaled the congregation with tales of the brothers dancing at her birthday, going to funparks and baking cakes.

In his address, Rev Hopkin spoke of the brothers looking forward to Christmas, he said: 'These boys, as you might expect, were looking forward to Christmas, the two Argos catalogues are still were they left them under the TV and apparently their Christmas list was endless.'

He said the last words spoken by the boys were words of love to their mother, as she dropped them of she said 'love you' and they responded 'to infinity and back'.

The two boys were rescued from the house in Penistone, along with their father, Darren Sykes, on October 22.

But Paul and Mr Sykes, 44, died later the same evening.

Jack was taken to a specialist unit in Manchester but died almost a week later.

Detectives have confirmed the fatal fire was started deliberately but said they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the investigation.

Mrs Sykes said on a specially set-up Facebook page that her estranged husband, the boys' father, had murdered them.
