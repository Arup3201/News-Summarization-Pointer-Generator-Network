World Cup debutants Bosnia-Herzegovina were stunned by lowly Cyprus in the first round of Euro 2016 qualifiers. 

They came from behind to win 2-1 in Wales's Group B. 

Stuttgart striker Vedad Ibisevic gave Bosnia, ranked 19th and a massive 121 places higher than their opponents in the world rankings, an early lead.

But Cyprus came back strongly and goals at the end of each half from Demetris Christofi turned the game on its head and earned the island nation a shock victory. 

Bosnia's misery was complete when Roma star Miralem Pjanic saw his penalty saved by Antonis Georgallides.  

It will come as a boost to Wales, who laboured to a 2-1 victory at minnows Andorra. They are joined in Group B by highly-fancied Belgium and Israel. 

Swansea midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson was the star of the show as Iceland thrashed Turkey 3-0 in Reykjavik. 

Iceland came close to qualifying for their first ever major championship last year, narrowly losing out to Croatia in a World Cup play-off, and started where they left off in Group A. 

Jon Dadi Bodvarsson scored a first half goal to put the hosts in charge. 

Sigurdsson and Kolbeinn Sigthorsson added strikes within a minute of each other to clinch the points.

Luka Modric celebrated his 29th birthday in style with a fabulous goal to set Croatia on the way to a 2-0 victory over Malta in Group H. 

The Real Madrid playmaker smashed in a 30-yard effort just after half-time and Andrej Kramaric sealed the points with his first international goal nine minutes from time.

In the same group Ventsislav Hristov's 87th minute winner for Bulgaria saw off stiff resistance from Azerbaijan, claiming a 2-1 win.

Bulgaria took the lead through Iliyan Mitsanski. Dimitrij Nazarov equalised before Hristov's late intervention.  

Italy won 2-0 in Norway in the group's other match.
