Women are half as likely as men to be in a job paying more than £50,000 a year, new figures show.

One in 15 female full-time workers earns over £50,000 a year, compared to one in seven men, according to figures that show a widening gender pay gap.

A separate survey claims the pay gap is such that women effectively work for free for 57 days a year.

To mark Equal Pay Day today, The Trades Union Congress (TUC) released new analysis of data from the Office for National Statistics.

It showed full-time female workers earn on average £28,000, compared to £33,000 for men, a difference of £5,000, or 16 per cent.

This gap is even greater in some jobs, widening to 27 per cent in the financial sector and 26 per cent for sales jobs – meaning women routinely earn just three-quarters of men’s wages.

Women working full-time as senior education professionals earn £13,000, or 22 per cent less, while full-time female solicitors earn £10,000, or 20 per cent, less.

The TUC said it showed that the glass ceiling was ‘stronger than ever’.

They said thousands of women were still being paid less money for the same job or being passed over for promotion.

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘Four decades on from the Equal Pay Act women are still losing out on pay and career opportunities.

‘It feels like the glass ceiling is getting stronger not weaker and we need a much tougher approach to stop future generations of women from suffering this pay penalty.

Labour's shadow minister for women and equalities Gloria De Piero said the party would call on big companies to publish their gender pay gap

‘Even when men and women are doing similar level jobs there is still a significant pay gap.

‘It seems that far too many women are also being passed over for promotion and are not receiving just reward for their hard work and talent.’

Separate data by The Fawcett Society found that the gender pay gap means women will effectively ‘work for free for the next 57 days of the year’.

The campaigning group decides when to hold Equal Pay Day based on the point in the year at which women effectively stop earning because they are paid less than men.

It said the day had to start three days earlier this year because the pay gap is growing.

Last year, ONS data showed the pay gap was widening for the first time in years.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) announced last month found Britain had dropped eight places in their worldwide gender equality table to 26th place - lagging behind Latvia, Burundi, South Africa, Rwanda and Nicaragua.

Yesterday, Labour called on big companies with more than 250 staff to publish their average hourly pay gap each year to expose whether men and women are being paid differently for doing the same work, and whether too few women occupy senior positions.

Gloria De Piero MP, Labour’s shadow minister for women and equalities said: ‘Women are working an extra three days for free this year because the pay gap is back on the rise.

‘Women shouldn’t have to wait another 50 years for Equal Pay which is why Labour will be calling a vote in Parliament to get big companies to publish their pay gap.’
