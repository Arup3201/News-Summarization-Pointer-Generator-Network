A woman whose ‘controlling’ ex-husband spanked her with a plimsoll as punishment for an affair says she hopes her case will help other domestic violence victims to come forward.

Graham Jones, 45, admitted hitting his primary school teacher wife Sarah on the bottom as punishment after learning of the relationship.

After he was sentenced to eight months, suspended for two years, yesterday she said: ‘Domestic abuse goes on in hundreds of houses.

It is a very isolating and lonely thing. It is very difficult to get out of once you are in it.

‘If just one other person is able to go to the police because of this case it will be a good thing.’

Before
 the assault in April last year, Jones had shown his 48-year-old wife 
two pie charts and a bar chart detailing how her affair had hurt him.

He took her into their cellar where he spanked her bare bottom four times with one of  their son’s gym plimsolls.

He bent her over the tumble dryer – which was on to drown out the noise of her crying.

She
 escaped to the kitchen but he followed, saying she must have eight 
spanks – one for every day he had known about the affair to ‘equal out’ 
his pain.

He pulled her pyjamas down again and gave her four further spanks with a spatula.

When police interviewed Jones after his wife complained the following day, he claimed she had consented to being hit.

He
 said the couple had engaged in adventurous sexual behaviour before and 
that she had texted him two days earlier suggesting she wanted to be 
spanked.

But he pleaded guilty to assault last month at Mold Crown Court in North Wales.

Last
 night, Mrs Jones said her ex-husband, a former headteacher, had ‘made 
up’ that she had suggested spanking in a text. ‘It was him who suggested
 it, not me.’

But 
outside court, Jones claimed: ‘Only 32 hours beforehand I received a 
text from her telling me she had been naughty, deserved to be punished 
and she consented to spanking as she has done over the years.’

The
 couple had initially had a successful marriage, but it ran into 
problems after Jones was forced to leave his job when he was caught 
having an affair, viewing porn on a school laptop and sending bullying 
emails to staff.

He 
resigned as head of Trelogan Primary School, in Flintshire, and was 
later suspended from working as a teacher for four months.

Jones found out about his wife’s affair when she accidentally sent him a text intended for her lover.

Sentencing,
 Judge Peter Hayward said he did not ignore that the spanking was the 
sort of behaviour they had practised in the past.

But the incident in question had occurred without her consent, he said.

Jones,
 from, Wrexham, was also ordered to attend a domestic violence course 
and made the subject of a two-year restraining order.
