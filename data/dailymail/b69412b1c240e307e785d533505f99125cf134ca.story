Bloodied and dazed, David Porter waits for urgent treatment on a bus commandeered by the emergency services.

Mr Porter, 63, had been sitting directly below the fallen section of the Apollo’s ceiling and was among the most seriously injured of the 76 casualties.

Yesterday he said it was ‘miraculous’ that he had survived - and that it ‘beggared belief’ that more people had not been seriously hurt.

David Porter and his wife Valerie were injured as they watched the performance on Thursday

Chaos: Mr Porter inside the theatre shortly after sections of the ceiling caved in

He said: ‘If you look at the pictures of the inside of the theatre there is a pile of debris exactly where I believe we were so it seems really miraculous that we walked out of it alive.

‘My wife did say she heard some cracking from above but I didn’t hear anything, I was focused on the stage so it all came completely out of the blue.

‘I had no inclination whatsoever that anything was wrong.

‘I felt a very hard blow to the head and one to the arm, my wife says I just took her hand, stood up and walked out but I don’t remember anything.

‘The next thing I knew we were in the foyer and there were police everywhere.’

He and his wife Valerie, 61, from Needingworth, Cambridgeshire, had been given tickets to the play as a present to mark their ruby wedding anniversary and had been enjoying the ‘best seats in the house’ before their evening took a dramatic turn for the worse. 

Wounds: Mr and Mrs Porter were recovering at home today after the incident

When the ceiling began to collapse they were pelted with rubble and plaster from above.

After being treated on the double decker bus commandeered by the London Ambulance Service to take the walking wounded to hospital, the couple were taken to Guy’s and St Thomas’ in Southwark.

Mr Porter was left with a suspected broken arm and a deep gash to his head. He was eventually discharged at 4am with 12 stitches in his head and another five in his arm.

He said: ‘The cut in my head was very deep and it 
was full of debris so it took the doctors a really long time to clean it
 all out. It was 4am by the time they said we could go home,’ he added.

Mrs Porter, a former ladieswear assistant, escaped with minor injuries and, although badly shaken by the experience, did not require hospital treatment.

Gash: It took doctors until 4am to remove all the debris from Mr Porter's head, leaving him with 12 stitches

The couple were collected by two of their three grown-up sons who rushed down from Cambridgeshire to drive them home.

Speaking about seeing the pictures of his bandaged and bloodied head in the news Mr Porter, a retired corporate sales manager said he didn’t initially realise how bad his injuries were.

Recovering at home yesterday he added: ‘I wondered why everyone was staring at me, it hurt a lot but I must have been in shock because I didn’t realise how bad it was.

‘I’m very sore today and have a terrible headache but I suppose that is to be expected.

‘It’s ironic because the tickets were given to us as a gift by my wife’s brother. If I had bought the tickets we would have got the cheap ones up in the stalls and we would have been alright, so they are feeling very guilty indeed.

‘We come down to go to the theatre once or twice a year so although this is not the sort of thing you expect when you book tickets I don’t think it will put us off.

‘The emergency services were superb and coped extraordinarily well under the circumstances.

‘It just seems to me that we were very lucky with how things went, it beggars belief how much worse it could have been.’ ‘It just seems to me that we were very lucky with how things went, it beggars belief how much worse it could have been.’

A total of 76 people were injured when a 10 square metre patch of the 112-year-old theatre’s ceiling collapsed during a packed out performance of the play The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.

In under an hour the 720-strong audience had been evacuated or rescued by emergency services.
