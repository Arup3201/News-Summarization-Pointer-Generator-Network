Brazil legend Ronaldo thinks the 2002 World Cup squad he was part of is better than every other Selecao team ever – apart from the side that won the trophy in Mexico in 1970.

Though many people believe the side that lost in the 1998 World Cup final against France was one of Brazil’s best teams ever, the striker disagrees.

‘The 1998 
team wasn’t as solid [as the 2002 side],’ Ronaldo told FourFourTwo. ‘I 
dare to say that team of 2002 was better than all the others Brazil sent
 to a World Cup, except for the 1970 team.

‘That 2002 team was very balanced: it had great defenders and great strikers. We could stop anyone and we could score at any time, against any team. There was jogo bonito and there was strategy.

‘It wasn’t as brilliant in 1994. Much less in 1998, although we did pretty well before the final. The 2002 team earned Brazil credibility, especially after our win over Belgium in the round of sixteen.’

Dejection: The Brazilian looks devastated in 1998

The 2002 tournament was Ronaldo’s third World Cup, though it was the first time he was able to show his best form in a final.

He was 
called up to the 1994 World Cup squad as a 17-year-old, but did not play
 any part as Brazil won the trophy for the fourth time in USA.

Four years
 later the stage looked set for the striker to lead his nation to 
victory in France, but he suffered convulsions and lost consciousness 
for several minutes before the final against the hosts.

The 
initial team sheet did not include the forward because of the episode, 
though he did play as Brazil were thrashed 3-0, with Ronaldo some way 
from his brilliant best.

In 2002, 
Ronaldo was able to get redemption, winning the Golden Boot and scoring 
twice in Brazil’s 2-0 win over Germany in the final.

Speaking of that win, he said: ‘No one slept from take-off in Japan to landing in Brazil.

‘There is a connection in the middle and I can’t remember where exactly because the party was in full-flow by then.

Surprise! Ronaldo has guest-edited the latest FourFourTwo

‘But we deserved it! After we arrived in Brazil, the celebrations went on for two more days. We were so worn out in the end.’

Ronaldo 
started all five of Brazil’s games at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, 
scoring three goals to become the leading all-time scorer in World Cup 
tournaments.

Brazil 
lost to a Zinedine Zidane-inspired France in the quarter-finals, though 
Ronaldo’s goalscoring record has remained until this year.

Miroslav 
Klose equaled the Brazilian’s tally of 15 during Germany’s group 
matches, and could surpass the former Real Madrid star with Germany into
 the quarter-finals after beating Algeria in extra-time on Monday.

To celebrate its 20th birthday, football magazine FourFourTwo asked Ronaldo to guest-edit a special edition.

Ronaldo worked with the FourFourTwo team to deliver the edition, which includes a special birthday photoshoot, as well as an in-depth feature on the great man’s life.

And he wrote about his role in an editor’s letter at the front of the special edition.

‘It was no picnic. I had to do things I’ve never done before, like suggest ideas for stories and get people for interviews (Ronaldinho, you’re my man!).

‘I can now say that scoring goals is easier than editing a magazine!'
