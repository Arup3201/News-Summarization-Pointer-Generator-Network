Eleanor Roosevelt was named the greatest first lady of the United States in a survey of historians released on Saturday, while Michelle Obama, in fifth place, edged out Hillary Clinton in sixth.

Roosevelt, whose husband, Franklin, served as president from 1933 to 1945, has come up number one each of the five times the survey has been conducted by Siena College Research Institute since 1982.

In the top finishers after Roosevelt were Abigail Adams, Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolley Madison.

First among first ladies: Eleanor Roosevelt in 1933

President Harry S. Truman later called Eleanor Roosevelt the 'First Lady of the World' in tribute to her human rights achievements, which include civil rights activism and playing a role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

She was the first presidential spouse to hold press conferences, write a syndicated newspaper column, and speak at a national convention.

Second: Abigail Adams, voted second, was the wife of John Adams, the second president of the United States

Popular: Dolley Madison was noted for her social skills, which helped boost her husband James Madison's popularity

Fashionable: Jacqueline Kennedy set the bar for stylish first ladies

'Whatâ€™s surprising is the incredible consistency this poll has shown for 32 years,' Don Levy, director of the Siena Research Institute in Loudonville, New York told the Christian Science Monitor. 'Still, Eleanor Roosevelt is far and away the top-rated first lady.'

'Itâ€™s not even close,' he says.

Least impressive, according to the survey, was Jane Pierce, the wife of 14th U.S. president, Franklin Pierce.

Although historians disagree over exactly when the title of first lady came into common usage, it has traditionally been given to a president's wife and is an unofficial, but potentially powerful, role.

Pollsters asked 242 historians and 
political scientists to rate 38 presidents' wives in 10 categories such 
as 'courage,' 'integrity,' 'value to the country' and 'accomplishments.'

New entry: Michelle Obama was voted fifth and is admired for 'being her own woman'

Political career: Potential future president Hillary Clinton was voted the sixth-best first lady of all time

Current first lady Michelle Obama scored particularly high in the categories of 'being her own woman' and 'value to the president.' Her weakest area was seen to be in her capacity of 'being the White House steward.'

Hillary Clinton was voted as the former first lady with the most presidential potential.

Rounding out the top 10 after Clinton were Lady Bird Johnson, Betty Ford, Martha Washington and Rosalynn Carter.

Respondents voted Laura Bush, Pat Nixon, Mamie Eisenhower, and Bess Truman as the first ladies who 'could have done more' while in the unofficial office.
