Recovering: Rio Negro, the racehorse who was poisoned by crooks days before he was due to run - a crime blamed on illegal gambling syndicates

One of Venezuela's most-popular race horses is struggling to regain his strength after he was poisoned by an underground gambling ring.

The attack on four-year-old stallion Rio Negro has shone a light on a criminal underworld where millions of dollars in bets are made under the table.

The horse's dramatic plight has underscored the growing brazenness of the well-organised betting rings in Venezuela, who many say threaten to destroy the sport entirely.

Rio Negro had been heavily favoured to win the Army Day derby until criminals injected him with a near-fatal overdose of cortisone sometime in June - police aren't exactly sure when.

His trainers say he nearly collapsed and began urinating frequently during a training session four days before the June 22 race. He lost almost a fifth of his weight, his black-colored skin broke out in welts and he was diagnosed with temporary diabetes.

'It was painful to watch,' said vet Julio Lobo.

Rio Negro is now kept in a dark, cold stable that looks more like a prison with iron bars and proliferation of security cameras to ward off intruders.

Like many of its neighbours, Venezuela has long-suffered lawlessness and violence. But the country's situation has been badly exacerbated by civil divisions caused by the leftist policies of its longstanding socialist government.

Since the death of hugely popular former president Hugo Chavez the country has been riven by unrest, with many middle class areas erupting into open revolt for a time earlier this year.

Despite the country's massive oil wealth, after nearly 15 years of socialist policies the economy is in recession, there are shortages of basic goods, annual inflation is running above 60 per cent and crime rates are sky high. The approval ratings of Chavez's hand-picked successor, Nicolas Maduro, a former bus driver, have plummeted to just 35 per cent.

But few in Venezuela are willing to return to the situation they faced before Chavez. Then it was one of the most unequal countries in the world, politically dominated by a mainly white ruling elite and with rates of poverty almost double current levels.

And many Venezuelans are deeply sceptical of the opposition's democratic credentials after a failed 2002 coup against Chavez which was backed by the U.S. Nevertheless, the country is very sick.

Authorities have arrested nine people in connection with the poisoning of Rio Negro, among them former police officers and a horse owner linked to betting rings.

But it's unknown if the investigation, an outcry from top government officials and beefed-up security at La Rinconada track in Caracas can control the rings that some racing officials call 'mafias.'

Gambling on horse races is legal in Venezuela, but the socialist government tightly controls betting at the country's four racetracks and 1,200 off-track bookies.

Illegal gambling is driven by the government's limit of 1,000 bolivars on bets, which converts to about $10 (£6.20) at the black market rate.

Last year, the industry in Venezuela handled about $120million in legal bets, according to the Paris-based International Federation of Horseracing Authorities.

But Jaime Casas and others who follow the local horse racing industry say the real money is in illegal betting, especially now as Venezuelans try to boost the value of their bolivars in the face of 60 per cent inflation and a plunge in the currency's value on the black market.

The illegal operations known as 'offices' can frequently be seen operating in plain view from inside the state-sanctioned gambling halls by so-called 'bankers' who receive bets in person and by phone.

Venezuela's state-run National Institute of Hippodromes declined to comment on the illicit operations.

Mr Casas, who runs the Hipicomputo 2000 website that tracks race results, estimated that illicit betting rings move between 50 and 60 times the legal market for gambling.

The state-run horse racing agency says that on any given Sunday the government's take from wagers at La Rinconada can surpass $3million.

Mr Casas said violence has also increasingly encroached on the sport through the kidnapping of and threats against jockeys.

'Illegal betting has existed in every part of the world for a long time,' he said. 'But here it was allowed to flourish with so much freedom and impunity.'
