Atletico Madrid president Enrique Cerezo has ruled out making moves for Fernando Torres, Javier Hernandez or Santi Cazorla this summer.

Chelsea's £50million striker has been linked with a return to his boyhood club while Diego Simeone has admitted he is keen on Manchester United poacher Hernandez.

Cazorla has also been linked with the La Liga winners but Cerezo insists none of the Premier League trio are on Atletico's radar, while also dismissing transfer speculation regarding Napoli's Jose Callejon.

Staying put: Atletico Madrid won't move for Fernando Torres, Javier Hernandez or Santi Cazorla

Spokesman: Enrique Cerezo was speaking upon the signing of Antoine Griezmann for £24million

'Many names have been mentioned, but none of those players, neither Cazorla, Callejon, Torres nor Chicharito (Hernandez) are on our agenda,' Cerezo told Radio Marca.

'If we sign another player, it won't be any of them.'

The Primera Division champions have endured a busy transfer window this summer, waving goodbye to Diego Costa, Filipe Luis, Thibaut Courtois, David Villa and Adrian Lopez.

Meanwhile, the club have added striker Mario Mandzukic, goalkeeper Jan Oblak, defender Guilherme Siqueira and forward Antoine Griezmann to their squad, with Argentinian full-back Cristian Ansaldi next to join.

Cerezo, however, rubbished reports that Brazilian centre back Joao Miranda could join Filipe Luis, Courtois and Costa at Stamford Bridge next season.

'I know nothing about that at all, and if I haven't heard about it it's because he's going to stay, I'm almost certain of that,' he said.
