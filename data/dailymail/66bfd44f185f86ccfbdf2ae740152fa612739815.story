'Just a kiss': Shawna Baudet, 25, revealed the truth behind the allegations, denying that she and her boss at MEC Greg Shickle had sex

As one of London’s leading advertising agencies, MEC might have thought that all publicity was good publicity.

But it will be feeling rather differently after a damning resignation email sent by one of its employees caused an internet sensation.

In the email, sent to the whole company, senior account manager Kieran Allen makes a series of salacious allegations against his boss.

He alleges that his 36-year-old boss 
‘took a female colleague out for a drink on the day he interviewed her, 
then later took her back to the MEC offices that night and had sexual 
relations with her in the meeting rooms on the 3rd floor’.

To
the astonishment of MEC’s 5,000 employees, Mr Allen, who has worked for
the company for more than two years, said he wanted to ‘expose the 
failings’ of supervisor Greg Shickle.

He claimed the allegations were ‘common knowledge’ among the 30-strong team Mr Shickle leads in his role as Head of Performance.

Soon
after Mr Allen sent the email on Tuesday morning, it had gone ‘viral’, 
becoming a main trend on Twitter and appearing on news websites 
worldwide.

Yesterday, a blonde MEC employee called Shawna Beaudet was revealed as being the infamous interviewee.

However,
the 25-year-old former boarding school pupil revealed the truth behind 
the allegations, denying that she and Mr Shickle had sex.

Canadian-born Miss Beaudet told the Mail: ‘I didn’t sleep with him. I kissed him.

'It was possibly slightly inappropriate.

'I had been to the pub with Greg for an informal interview for a job.

'It was a kiss in the foyer whilst waiting for taxis. We were both single at the time.’

She said she read the email when she 
came into work earlier this week, and colleagues said to her: ‘Er, you 
might want to check your emails.’

‘It has been a crazy week,’ she said. ‘I thought it was hilarious until I read the part about me.

'I even said to Greg he should say, “I did not have sexual relations with that woman”, like [Bill] Clinton said.’

'You might want to check your emails': After the message from Kieran Allen was leaked it spawned a storm of comment on social messaging site Twitter under the hashtag #shicklegate

Miss Beaudet, who lives in Fulham, West London, said: ‘It was a bit presumptuous of Kieran to write that email.

'I
feel bad for Greg because he’s a good guy. The other things Kieran said
in the email are not true. I mean they were just said in jest.’

Miss Beaudet, who has worked for MEC 
for a year, insists that she did not get her present job as account 
manager because of kissing Mr Shickle.

In the email, Mr Allen claimed that at
first he had been rewarded with bonuses and promotions, but in the last
eight months, his workload had tripled and doctors had warned him he 
was on the brink of an ‘imminent breakdown’.

MEC said they were investigating the allegations.

The company added: ‘We are sad that one of our employees has chosen to share their personal views in such a public way and has left the company with such bad feeling.’

Yesterday, Mr Shickle worked from home.

He said he was consulting lawyers over the allegations.

‘You can’t just take an unsubstantiated email from a disgruntled employee and make a comment on it,’ he added

Mr Allen was not available for comment.
