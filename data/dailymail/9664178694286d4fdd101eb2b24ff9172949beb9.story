George Ford knows when it became obvious Toby Flood’s presence at Leicester Tigers became an obstacle to his dream of playing in next year’s World Cup — prompting him to sign for Bath 18 months ago.

‘It was when I wasn’t playing,’ he said this week. ‘I was getting in the 23 but only getting five minutes here and there. There were a run of games where I hardly played and just did a hell of a lot of training.

‘I just felt to progress I needed to play. Floody was playing quite well at the time but I felt there were opportunities throughout that couple of years where I felt I could have been given more of a shot.

The Bath fly-half holds no animosity towards Flood but felt he had to leave Leicester for the sake of his career

‘I probably understand why I wasn’t but I made the decision to move to give myself the best chance of playing.’

It was a bold decision for a 20-year-old. But it was a decision driven by a desire to deliver on the promise that had already seen the Oldham-born youngster become the first 16-year-old to play professional rugby union in England in 2009 before being named the International Rugby Board young player of the year the following season.

But there’s no inkling of resentment towards Flood, who earned the majority of his 60 England caps during his time at Welford Road.

George Ford found opportunities limited at Leicester due to Toby Flood’s presence, so the youngster moved to Bath to boost his chances of an England call-up.

FORD AT LEICESTER (2010-13)

Matches (starts): 26 (15)

Points scored: 163

Tries: 1

Conversions: 19

Penalties: 39

Drop goals: 1

England caps: 0

FORD AT BATH (2013-present)

Matches (starts): 27 (26)

Points scored: 334

Tries: 3

Conversions: 50

Penalties: 70

Drop goals: 3

England caps:2

‘We always kicked together so we spent a lot of time away from team sessions together,’ said Ford, 21.

‘I remember in the World Cup season (2011) we had a bad losing streak. Toby came back from New Zealand and we sat down and had a good chat about my performances.

‘He kept emphasising that I just had to go out and be myself, prepare well and have confidence in myself. Everything else will take care of itself. Don’t stress too much. He was very much a calming influence.’

The advice has paid off as richly as Ford’s move to Bath. This week — with Flood unavailable for selection after moving to Toulouse in France in the summer — the Bath No 10 was selected as one of three fly-halves alongside Owen Farrell and Stephen Myler in England’s 33-man squad named by head coach Stuart Lancaster for next month’s QBE autumn series.

With Farrell inked in as first-choice for next year’s World Cup, and Ford still without an international start following his late withdrawal with a shoulder injury from the summer tour to New Zealand, it is inconceivable he won’t be handed a lead role in at least one Test next month. A strong showing on Saturday for the No 10 against Toulouse and his former club rival in the European Champions Cup at the Recreation Ground would be the perfect way for the youngster to sign off before the autumn Tests.

‘I didn’t think I could be any more hungry,’ he said. ‘But to miss the tour, and be sat there at home in a sling watching the three Tests, it really made me realise how much I want to get to that level and come back in the summer, try to train as hard as I can and get my shoulder as fit as I could and start the season as well as I could at Bath.

‘I obviously want to be playing at that level and do everything I can to try to get there. I don’t know too much about international rugby yet — but I can only find out by playing. I definitely feel that if Stuart gives me a shot I’ll be ready.’

Their impressive start to the Aviva Premiership campaign, which has seen them chalk up 22 tries in six games, has convinced Lancaster that Ford is not the only Bath player ready. The England head coach named no fewer than seven in his squad with Semesa Rokoduguni, Jonathan Joseph, Dave Attwood, Rob Webber and David Wilson all starting on Saturday as the West Countrymen face one of the biggest games in the club’s recent history.

Bath’s back-to-back defeats at Wasps and last week away at Glasgow, in their opening Cup clash, have put even more emphasis on Saturday’s game against the four-time tournament winners. 

‘We had some honest meetings on Monday when a lot of good things were said,’ Ford admitted. ‘A lot of people put their hands up and said it (the Glasgow performance) was unacceptable. We need to turn that around and quickly. The intensity of the training session we had on Tuesday was brilliant.

‘It wasn’t meant to be a full contact session but it turned out a bit like that because of the reaction we need and the intensity we need to get to at the weekend. People were on the edge. We need to be like that against Toulouse. The game has been built up and rightly so. We haven’t played a game this big for three or four years at the club. It is a massive challenge but we will give it our all this week.’
