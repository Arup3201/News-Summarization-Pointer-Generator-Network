The number of homeowners under 35 has collapsed in the last two decades as first-time buyers struggle to get on to the property ladder.

Analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows home ownership has roughly halved for younger age groups, only rising among pensioners.

In 1991, one in three Britons aged 16 to 24 owned their own home – a feat unimaginable by 2011 when it had fallen to just one in ten.

The number of homeowners aged 25 to 34 has also dropped sharply, from two-thirds to less than half.

Even older age groups are struggling to save for deposits and obtain mortgages, according to the ONS.

Between 1991 and 2011, the number of homeowners aged 35 to 44 fell from three-quarters to two-thirds, while there was a small drop for those aged 45 to 64.

By contrast, home ownership increased among the over-65s during the same period, rising from just over half to almost three-quarters. The ONS said one contributing factor behind the decline in the number of young buyers was the rise in the value of deposits needed to secure a mortgage.

The date reflects soaring house prices and tougher lending rules, which have made it harder to secure a home loan with a small deposit (file picture)

This reflects soaring house prices and tougher lending rules, which have made it harder to secure a home loan with a small deposit.

House building has also been in long-term decline since 1980, dropping off significantly following the recession. This has put pressure on housing stock, pushing up prices.

The report said: ‘House prices have been increasing and first-time buyers are finding it more difficult to get on the property ladder, while home ownership among younger age groups generally has declined.’

But despite the doom and gloom, prospects for first-time buyers seem to be improving.

Separate figures reported yesterday estimated that more than 300,000 people took their first step on the property ladder last year.

According to the data, released by Halifax, 2014 saw the highest number of first-time buyers since 2007.

The Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) also revealed that an estimated £205.6billion-worth of mortgages were granted last year to all types of borrowers – the largest sum lent since 2008.

The overall value of home loans advanced during 2014 was 17 per cent higher than the £176billion-worth of deals handed out in 2013, it said.

CML economist Bob Pannell said the 300,000 first-time buyers were a ‘key driver’ of last year’s market recovery.

He admitted that it was still a ‘far cry from the half million that we might regard as normal’, but said it was a step in the right direction.
