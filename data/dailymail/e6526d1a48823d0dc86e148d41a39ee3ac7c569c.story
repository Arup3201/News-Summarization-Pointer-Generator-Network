An Australian shooter has claimed he is being discriminated against because he cannot share a room with his athlete wife, while gay couples can.

Russell Mark said was sent an email by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) which explained that he and wife Lauryn, also a shooter, were forbidden from sharing a room while competing at this month's London 2012 Olympics.

The decision has angered the couple who claimed they know of many same sex couples who have been given permission to share a room.

Daft: Russell Mark said was sent an email by the Australian Olympic Committee (AOC) which explained that he and wife Lauryn, also a shooter, were forbidden from sharing a room while competing at this month's London 2012 Olympics

Russell has also caused controversy in recent weeks by saying he takes sleeping tablets in order to help him perform better as an athlete and hit out at officials who banned them at the Olympics

It is believed the decision was made by 
Shooting Australia but the couple believe the AOC has singled them out 
because of a raunchy photo shoot Lauryn took part in and Russell's 
stance on sleeping pills.

Australian athletes are banned from using sleeping aides at the Olympics but Russell recently caused controversy and she they were essential in helping him perform better.

His wife Lauryn is also thought to have angered officials by taking part in a photo shoot for Zoo magazine.

Dressed in a green and gold bikini, and toting a shotgun, she is featured in an Australian edition of the lads mag.

However, the couple now believe their actions have caused Australian Olympic chiefs to discriminate against them and were told they would have to leave the Olympic village and rent a hotel if they wanted to stay together.

'The stupid part of this, which I have argued to them, is that there are tons of gay couples on the Olympic team who will be rooming together so we are being discriminated against because we are heterosexual,' Russell said to news.com.au.

'They are p***ed with my stance on sleeping tablets and what p***ed them more than anything else is the photo shoot.'

Russell Mark said Olympic chiefs were discriminating against him and his wife because they did not agree with his views on sleeping tablets and did not like his wife taking part in a sexy photo shootntally challenging sport like ours,

Russell added that it was obvious that officials had a problem and were punishing them for it.

Lauryn said she hoped the photo shoot for Zoo, which is released in Australia today, would be a positive thing for the sport and said the proceeds were being given to the Royal Children's Hospital.

She also said she was 'frustrated' by the AOC's decision because same sex couples were allowed to share rooms if they were both competitors.

The couple also claim they have been allowed to stay in the same room while taking part in major championships around the world.

The AOC was not available for comment.
