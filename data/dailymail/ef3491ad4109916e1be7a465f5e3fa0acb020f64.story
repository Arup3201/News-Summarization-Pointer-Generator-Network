Tour operators have paid out more than £5.5million in compensation to almost a thousand British tourists hit with food-poisoning while on holiday at the same hotel in just one year.

First Choice today agreed a £1.9m settlement of claims brought by over 400 holiday-makers, 60 of them children, who stayed in 2007 at the Bahia Principe resort, in San Juan, Dominican Republic.

The deal comes on top of settlements previously reached with Thomas Cook, My Travel and Thomson in hundreds of other cases of tourists who claimed there were struck down by severe gastric illnesses including Salmonella, Shigella and Campylobacter.

The claimants' solicitors, Irwin Mitchell, say weddings, honeymoons and birthday celebrations were ruined by food-poisoning outbreaks which at one stage saw a fleet of ambulances ferrying guests to hospital daily.

According to the firm, the damages paid by the tour operators in 963 cases relating to a single year - 2007 - now exceed £5.5million.

Irwin Mitchell says it has also pursued other claims relating to guests at the same hotel between 1997 and last year.

Guests staying at the hotel in 2007 told lawyers of the 'awful' conditions including:

Some guests described the hotel as 
being like a 'casualty ward', with fleets of ambulances ferrying poorly 
guests to hospital day after day.

Guests witnessed a waiter vomiting in reception and other staff were seen attending the doctor for treatment.

Honeymooners Aonghus Morrison, 35, and his wife Karen, 29, from Darklands in Glasgow had been hoping to spend two weeks enjoying their luxury Caribbean surroundings, but were struck down with the sickness within days of their arrival.

Mrs Morrison said: 'The state of the hotel was really awful – we were told we were booking a four-star resort, however the hotel room didn’t even look like it had been properly cleaned.

'The dining area was very off-putting as there were always birds flying around and landing on tables. The food on the buffet was left uncovered for long periods of time, exposing it to the insects that were constantly flying around and we often saw plates covered in flies.'

After the honeymoon couple both fell ill, Mr Morrison went to visit the hotel doctor – only to find that there was a huge queue of people also waiting to be seen and who were complaining of the same symptoms.

'Aonghus had to wait for several hours before he was seen. Eventually he was given two different types of antibiotics and pain killers for his stomach and was told to drink electrolytes,' she said.

'He had to bring my dose back to the hotel room for me as by that point I was too weak to move anywhere.'

The issues were said to be so bad that one plane flying UK passengers back from the country was quarantined at Gatwick.

Another at the same airport and one landing at Manchester were boarded by doctors as guests needed treatment on the runway before they could disembark.

Clive Garner, a Partner and Head of the International Travel Law team at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are delighted for our clients that they have now received a fair settlement from the tour operators after enduring such terrible times at the Bahia Principe.

'The long history of guests suffering illness at this hotel makes grim reading. There have been problems at the hotel on and off for 10 years in the lead up to the 2007 outbreak, and we are still receiving complaints from guests 5 years after that dreadful outbreak.

'We remain very concerned that hotels and tour operators have not learned vital lessons and that all too often holidaymakers suffer illness, sometimes with life changing consequences due to inadequate health and hygiene standards.

'We want the general public to be safe while on holiday and we urge the travel industry to clean up its act and take all possible steps to prevent illnesses which can so easily be avoided.'

All the companies involved have been contacted for comment, but had not responded by the time of publication.

Following Thomas Cook's settlement with customers in 2009, a spokesman for the company said the company it insists on high standards at its partner hotels.

The spokesman said: 'We take all reports of illness very seriously and we were very concerned by the outbreak of sickness that took place at the Bahia Principe in 2007.

'We are pleased that the majority of legal cases have now been settled and we want to be able to reassure all our customers that we work with our hotel partners to continually monitor the hygiene standards in their properties.'
