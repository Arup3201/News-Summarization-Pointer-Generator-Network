A man who first rose to fame after performing at the Superbowl with Madonna has now made his way into the record books - after walking the world's highest ever slackline.

A piece of fabric suspended midair between two hot air balloons in the Nevada desert, 4,000 feet above the ground, was the scene where Andy Lewis, 27, from California, set the record - in less than 20 seconds.

The record was for the highest line ever walked above ground level. The previous record was 3,000 feet - a number easily beaten by Mr Lewis.

Andy Lewis set the world record for the highest slackline to be walked above ground level. At an astounding 4,000 feet above ground, Mr Lewis walked the rope held by two hot air balloons in the middle of the Nevada desert

Mr Lewis smashed the previous record - which was 3,000 feet, by 1,000 feet. He completed the challenge near Las Vegas last month

The daredevil, from California is known as 'Sketchy Andy' because he will brave any challenge which comes his way

The fabric measured just 39 feet in length and was set up in the desert near Las Vegas.

And Mr Lewis did not even use a leash for the crossing, his safety net was a parachute attached to his body.

To prepare himself for the moment, Mr Lewis and his team did trial runs at the somewhat lower height of 6-10 feet and then 600-700 feet before untying the balloons and pulling them to the extraordinary height of 4,000 feet.

While he walked, his friend Jona Marie-Price dangled upside down in mid-air and admired the scene. Mrs Price, who provided the balloons and helped design the project, is the inspiration behind the record.

After completing the record, Mr Lewis balanced himself on the edge of the hot air balloon and punched the air in celebration

Mr Lewis, who is known under the nickname 'Stetchy Andy' because of his willingness to try his hand at anything - no matter how high - completed the stunt.

After the stunt, Mr Lewis said: 'It felt amazing to be on the line, it was very free and incredibly exposed.

'I will have a lot of self-doubt before I
 walk the line but the nerves turned into excitement and the excitement 
turned into focus and I love walking when it's a challenge the most.'

That's what I had in store: Mr Lewis surveys the air balloons from ground level

Just three weeks before a French team, known has The Skyliners or 'The Flying Frenchies' had failed when they attempted the feat in Spain.

And the challenge wasn't enough for the Californian, now based in Utah, who then skydived down to ground from the mid-air scene.

He described the dive as like 'a victory dance'. He said: 'The skydive was a release after the tension of the high line.

'Falling is so easy compared to high lining. It's like a victory dance.'

Before taking on the real challenge Mr Lewis practiced by setting up the line just metres above the ground

In 2012, Mr Lewis brought slacklining into popular culture by performing alongside Madonna at the 2012 Superbowl half-time show.

Madonna was so in awe of the sportsman that she then asked him to come on tour with him. Mr Lewis turned the offer down because he wanted to continue traveling the world living the 'slacklife'.

He described this as: 'about finding your passions and doing your best'.

The video of the successful stunt was released to promote the launch of the new online adventure network the Limitless Channel

The height of the slackline was almost a seventh of the height of Mount Everest - which measures 29,000 feet.

The Empire State Building measures 1,250 feet - less than three times the height of the line.

Its height was almost four times higher than the Eiffel Tower - with a height of 1,062 feet.

With 163 floors and measuring 2,716 feet, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest man-made structure in the world. But the line was set up more than 1,000 feet higher than the tip of the Dubai building.

From afar, this man looks as though he is stepping through thin air - in fact, thousands of miles from Nevada, these line walkers took on a challenge of their own and set a UK record for line walking in Snowdonia, Wales.

Above an equally dramatic scenery, Guy Ruyssevelt, 24, Tom Parker, 23, and Dutch circus performer Jacob Hirsch went highlining over the Ogwen Valley in Snowdonia.

At 250 feet, above a steep drop, they set the record for the highline completed at the highest altitude ever in the UK.

And once they had finished, daredevil Tom Parker dangled himself upside down from the piece of fabric.

The scene was captured by British photographer Ray Wood, 44 who photographed the walkers making their way across the 40 metre-long rope at the summit of the Tryfan Mountain.

It took them two hours to reach the scene. Once they had arrived, a line was erected after the climbers put slings around large blocks and boulders to keep the piece of fabric in place.

Mr Wood said he felt 'lucky' to have witnessed the scene and described the day as one of the most exciting of his career.

He said: 'It was the position of the highline that made it spectacular. Because of its location near the summit of Tryfan it was the highest-altitude highline made to date in the UK and that made it a really special event.

'I was so lucky to see these guys in action, they made it look incredibly graceful and from a distance it looked as if they were walking in the sky.'

Mr Wood said that the highliners had to adjust their balance as the rope moved under their feet.

He said: 'If the line is set-up properly the high liners shouldn’t be in any danger, however, there’s a great deal of critical judgement in the complex rigging of the line.

'The pressure placed on the anchors by simply walking across a taut high line can be incredibly large and that’s before the shock of falling-off on to the line is taken into account.

'It isn’t something to be considered without having somebody involved with a great deal of experience at setting-up highlines.'

Circus performer Jacob Hirsch travelled from Holland to set the UK record

The walk was not enough for highliner Tom Parker who then hung himself upside down from the piece of rope
