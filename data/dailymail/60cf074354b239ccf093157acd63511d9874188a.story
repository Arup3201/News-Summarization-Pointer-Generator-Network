Most drivers are more than happy to tell people how great their parallel parking is, but this guy really could claim to be the master.

While it requires a certain skill level to manoeuvre a vehicle into a tight spot, Chen Zhongliang, 31, has taken it to the extreme.

He showed off his impressive parking prowess on Tuesday as he took just seven swift moves to pull into his tiny alley-way space in Fujian, south of Beijing.

Chen Zhongliang, 31, showed off his impressive skills on Tuesday as he pulled into his tiny alley-way parking space in Fujian, south of Beijing

His parking spot is just a small gap in the side of a brick building and measures a mere 1.82 metres wide and five metres in length, the Shanghaiist reports.

The space is so tight there's absolutely no way a passenger could get out and the 4WD's bonnet and boot are just a few centimetres shy of hitting the brick walls on either side. 

The impressive showcase came about after a passer-by snapped a photo of the parked vehicle and it went viral on Chinese social media being hailed as the 'best parking job'.

As admirers were checking out Mr Chen's impressive skills, he returned to his car and was bombarded with questions as to how he did it. 

Naturally, the easiest way for the 31-year-old to explain was to give a seamless demonstration in front of a crowd of people.
