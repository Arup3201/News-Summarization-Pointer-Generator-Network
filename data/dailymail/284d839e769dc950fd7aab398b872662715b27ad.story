Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard claims Jose Mourinho won't be bothered by tarnishing his legacy after  Chelsea's latest ill-mannered exit from the Champions League.

The Blues crashed out of Europe's elite competition after a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night sent Paris Saint-Germain through to the quarter finals on away goals.

The game was marred by regular interruptions for fouls and unsportsmanlike behaviour  while the French media has accused Mourinho of being responsible for the sending off of Zlatan Ibrahimovic as nine Blues players crowded the referee following his foul on Oscar.

However, Gerrard - who came close to signing for Mourinho's Blues in 2005 - believes the Portuguese will not be worried about the legacy he leaves because he is 'a winner'.

The Reds captain was speaking ahead of an All-Star charity match at Anfield that will see him line up alongside the likes of Thierry Henry and Luis Suarez against a team managed by  Jamie Carragher which features Didier Drogba and Pepe Reina.

'I think it's normal when you play games at that level. Players and managers want to win so much - players will try every trick in the book to try and get over the line and win football matches,' he told reporters.

'Sometimes it doesn't look nice but we've all been guilty of it throughout our careers by not always abiding by the rules.

Jose Mourinho will not be concerned by bully-boy tactics tarnishing his reputation, says Gerrard

'I think PSG got through because they're the better team and good luck to them going forward. Chelsea had a very good effort, but it wasn't to be for them.

'I don't think he (Mourinho) will be interested in whether it will tarnish his legacy. He's a winner, he's won many, many trophies. Every single player out there has respect for him as a manager, he's going to win many more titles and will probably go down as one of the best managers of all time.

'I'm in no position to criticise him or have a go at him. He does it his way and I respect that. But, I'm only interested in one manager and that's the one that I've got here.'

Meanwhile, former Liverpool defender and Sportsmail columnist Carragher admitted he was more concerned for the standard of the Premier League than Chelsea's elimination.

'I'm disappointed because our league has lost its best team in the competition. And to see them come up so short on the night to PSG - who looked a class act and credit to them as they have some very good players - but for our league in general,' he said.

'You look at Manchester City and Arsenal's first legs, and hopefully they can come through. Ourselves, Liverpool not qualifying for the knockout stages, so not so much for Chelsea but for our league. You want to see the teams do well and at this moment we're coming up a bit short,' he added.
