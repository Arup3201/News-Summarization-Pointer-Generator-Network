Average Americans will chow down on 2,400 calories during the Super Bowl, though their favorite food for the event may also be the most healthy.

Vegetables have been the most popular food eaten during the big game for the past 30 years, said Harry Balzer, a chief food industry analyst for NPD.

Baby carrots and vegetable trays are the most eaten food during the NFL's championship game.

However, wings, pizza and beer will also see sales increases when the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks in Arizona.

Americans will consume roughly 1.25billion chicken wings on Super Bowl Sunday, though vegetable trays and baby carrots have been the most popular for the last 30 years, according to NPD

Superbowl Sunday is thought to be the day of America's second-highest day for food consumption each year after Thanksgiving, according to Reuters.

The Atlanta-based Calorie Control Council said that the estimated 2,400 calories set to be consumed by the average American amounts to a slice of pizza, four cans of beer, one serving of BBQ wings, one serving of fried chicken, a portion of Nachos with, a slice of cheese cake, a milkshake and fries.

The National Chicken Council says that the country will eat 1.25billion chicken wings, with ranch, barbeque and blue cheese dressings the most popular dips.

The ten-figure number of wings is enough to put more than 500 on every seat of every NFL football stadium and adds up to nearly two chickens killed for every American. 

Domnio's and Pizza Hut generally expect to sell around 11million and 2million slices respectively, according to Forbes. 

Americans will wash it all down by drinking 325.5million gallons of beer. 

NPD said that sales of televisions during Super Bowl week, which is the third most popular week to buy a TV, will also likely increase this year.

Americans will spend about $14.3 billion in total on the Super Bowl, or an average of $77.88 per consumer.
