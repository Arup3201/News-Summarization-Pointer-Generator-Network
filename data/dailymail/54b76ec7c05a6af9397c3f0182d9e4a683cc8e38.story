Russell Brand launched a foul-mouthed attack on Labour's Ed Balls on television, branding him a 'clicky-wristed snidey c***'.

The outspoken left-wing comedian hit out at the shadow chancellor during Channel 4's Big Fat Anniversary Quiz.

And he warned Mr Balls and former Prime Minister Tony Blair that they faced a tough time when his planned revolution overthrows the political establishment.

Comedian Russell Brand tore into Labour's Ed Balls on the Channel 4 show, The Big Fat Anniversary Quiz

Teammate Noel Fielding seemed visibly shocked after Brand called Mr Balls a ''clicky-wristed snidey c***'.

Brand was appearing on the show alongside other comedians including Noel Fielding, Jonathan Ross, Jack Whitehall and Claudia Winkleman.

It included questions about the last 10 years, and in one round teams were asked about an infamous tweet which Balls sent which simply stated: 'Ed Balls.'

Between questions Whitehall asked Brand about the Labour MP's prospects if he gets his way and overthrows democracy. Whitehall asked: 'Ed Balls, Russell, after the revolution?'

Brand replied: 'I think it's gonna be a tough time for Ed Balls.'

He went on: 'I shook his hand once. All clicky wristed, he was a snidey c***.'

Fellow guests including Whitehall and Winkleman appeared visible shocked by the foul-mouthed slur.

The remark came after Jack Whitehall, pictured with Claudia Winkleman, asked Brand if Mr Balls would survive his planned revolution

The quiz, hosted by Jimmy Carr, had asked what Mr Balls had tweeted in 2011 which had been retweeted thousands of times

Referring to Brand's confrontation last year with Newsnight host Jeremy Paxman, Whitehall added: 'Why didn't you say that in the Paxman interview?'

Host Jimmy Carr said 'all clicky wrists' sounded like something from dystopian crime drama A Clockwork Orange.

Brand went on, inspired by the film's Nadsat slang: 'All clickly wrist he were, real horror show. Me and my droogies done him in. Did him good it did as he spilt his claret like silvery wine.'

Whitheall, appearing baffled, responded: 'It sounds wonderful but I am going to have to have it Google translated to posh.'

The question in the quiz related to the tweet posted by Mr Balls on April 28 2011 which just said: 'Ed Bals.'

In April 2011 Mr Balls posted just 'Ed Balls', which sparked a Twitter frenzy and led to April 28 being named Ed Balls Day

A spokesman for Mr Balls declined to comment on Brand's foul-mouthed attack

It has since been retweeted more than 30,000 times. As Carr gave the answer to the question, Brand responded: 'What a prick, clicky wrist prick.'

Earlier in the show Brand suggested Mr Blair would also be in trouble when his revolution came. He has argued that there is little point in voting and insisted 'profit' is a dirty word. 

In 2013 Brand launched similar verbal assault on David Cameron, calling the Tory Prime Minister a 'w*****'.

He told Alan Carr's Chatty Man: 'If you're always cutting benefits and being horrible, it's because you don't know how to f*** properly.

'I think if your job is to look after the country and you don't care about the people who need it most, you're out of order, and you're a filthy, dirty, posh w*****.'

A spokesman for Mr Balls declined to comment.
