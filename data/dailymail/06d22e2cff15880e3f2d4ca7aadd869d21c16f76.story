Ronny Deila had been clear. This was a night for Virgil van Dijk, the defender Celtic rate in the £10million bracket, to make a bold, decisive impact in European competition. It’s doubtful this was what the Parkhead manager had in mind.

Van Dijk’s dismissal, for two soft yellow cards in nine first half minutes, was both damaging and contentious. Through Celtic eyes the Slovakian referee Ivan Kruzliak, a card happy, inconsistent character, was a key contributor to their latest night of disappointment on Italian soil.

As they left the field Celtic players remonstrated long and bitterly with the referee. Fredy Guarin’s stunning 20 yard strike had broken their stubborn, tired resistance three minutes from time, but the anger lingered long into the night.

The disappointment won’t be eased by the knowledge the club will inevitably face yet another trial by UEFA for events high in the top tier of the San Siro, after a handful of mindless idiots in their 3500 travelling support ignored pre-match pleas to leave their flares at home. 

For the second successive away game pyrotechnics were witnessed amongst the Parkhead fans, in the 49th minute of a game their team finished with credit.

They are out of the Europa League after a sixth successive away game without winning. From the moment Van Dijk sustained his second booking – as soft as the first – their fate looked almost inevitable.

Celtic’s number five collided with Rodrigo Palacio in 27 minutes in a clumsy challenge. 

With an hour to play there was an ominous feel to the flash of yellow and so it proved when Van Dijk clumsily panicked and blundered into the back of Mauro Icardi in 36 minutes. Inter Milan players, the masters of influencing impressionable referees, did their bit.

The red card was duly shown and Celtic’s early promise, their growing optimism, was dented. Ironically, there were long spells after Van Dijk’s departure when the Scottish champions looked more secure. They repelled their serie A opponents manfully despite their numerical disadvantage.

The shame of it all is this. With eleven men this was a night which promised so much more. In their imposing San Siro cathedral Roberto Mancini’s Inter Milan were here for the taking.

With a full complement for half an hour Celtic were confident, composed, dangerous.

They had a great chance in eight minutes when Gary Mackay-Steven was in on goal, clean as a whistle. 

The former Dundee United man gathered Emilio Izaguirre’s probing cross, took a great first touch and made time to pick his spot. His sidefoot was blocked by Juan Pablo Carrizo, Inter sweeping up the park instantly to create a shooting chance for Rodrigo Palacio.

But this was a night when Craig Gordon, in contrast with the 3-3 first leg draw in Glasgow, looked the part. He blocked Palacio’s effort and, before him, Van Dijk was beginning to look like the defender people think he can be at this level. Then the roof caved in.

There will be Celtic people who suspect the referee was a homer from the start. Long before he started waving his red card around.

In 14 minutes the Scottish champions shouted long and hard for a penalty kick.

In a fine move John Guidetti, starting up front after Leigh Griffiths sustained an injury on Wednesday night, poked the ball into the path of Stefan Johansen, the Norwegian’s first time nudge into the path of Stuart Armstrong sending the midfielder towards goal.

What happened next was a huge bone of contention. At first glance Inter full-back Davide Santon leaned into his back. Television pictures were less conclusive. Had Celtic won the penalty it would have been soft.

But no softer than the two yellow cards which rendered them numerically disadvantaged after 36 minutes. And, to the despair and dismay of the 3500 travelling support – they left their flares at home this time – forced Deila to introduce Efe Ambrose to the fray for the withdrawn Mackay-Steven.

In more ways than one the psyche, the feel, of this game changed. For half an hour Celtic had found their way into Inter’s faces. They pressed high up the pitch, they carved the better chances. 

The minute Van Dijk went the game changed. Like a pin pricking the bubble of optimism Ronny Deila’s side – chasing the first win in 12 attempts on Italian soil in the club’s history – looked shot.

They still had Craig Gordon of course. No one believed the Scotland keeper’s haphazard performance in Glasgow was likely to be repeated here and it wasn’t.

He pulled off an outstanding wrist twisting save from Mauro Icardi’s eight yard header immediately after the red card.

In a frantic spell before half-time he then brilliantly blocked a driven, angled effort from Danilo D’Ambrosio after strong defending from Jason Denayer.

He was at it again in 55 minutes. Resuming normal service and proving the first leg aberrations were freakish in nature.

Expectations of an Inter storm at the outset of the second half proved misplaced. But chances were inevitable and Icardi – a hugely talented footballer – crafted one when he ghosted in behind the visiting defence, failing to angle his low shot enough to put it past a goalkeeper growing in confidence more and more by the minute.

The problem for Celtic was obvious. A man down they began to drop deeper and tire.

In attack John Guidetti – with two goals in two games – toiled for mobility and pace. The loss of Griffiths the night before in training was now apparent. James Forrest – a winger – replaced the Swede in attack.

Inevitably it did nothing to prevent Celtic’s slow, weary retreat into their own half. A 4-4-1 formation left Forrest – a player short of match sharpness - to run around up front in the hope of a breakaway.

Predictably, Inter dominated possession. They had a fine chance in 66 minutes when Palacio found space at the back post to head square for the unmarked Shaqiri. The ball was inches too high and, again, Celtic survived. 

Inter didn’t need a goal, of course. Celtic did.

To that end the final throw of the dice was the introduction of Kris Commons with 12 minutes to play. He stung the palms of Carrizo in the Inter goal with his first audacious long range shot. There was nothing to lose now. Somehow Celtic needed a goal. The game needed a goal.

Regrettably it came for Inter and it was outstanding. Celtic were defending for their lives when Guarin, the Colombian midfielder, wound back his right foot and smashed an outstanding shot into the postage stamp corner.
