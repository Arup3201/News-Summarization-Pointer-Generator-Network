Mark Sanford, the disgraced former South Carolina governor, is engaged to the Argentinian mistress who cost him his political career.

Sanford, 52, surprised journalist María Belén Chapur last week with a wedding proposal in Buenos Aires that left them both crying and promising to stay together forever.

The Republican politician was considered a rising star and a possible presidential contender until he disappeared for six days in 2009 and returned to reveal he had been meeting Miss Chapur in secret in Argentine.

Cheesy: Sanford had the waiter at an upscale restaurant give the engagement ring to Miss Chapur while he hid in the bathroom

Sanford confirmed to CNN that he had, indeed, proposed.

'Yes, we are engaged, and I’m both happy and excited for what that means, I have long expressed my feelings for her, she’s a wonderful person. My closest friends have met and love her, and I look forward to introducing her to still many more that have yet to do so,' he said.

In a 2009 interview after the news of the affair broke, Sanford referred to Miss Chapur as his 'soul mate' and admitted he had 'cross the line' with other women before. 

His wife Jenny moved their four sons out of the governor's mansion after his admission. She divorced him less than a year later.

Argentinian news site Clarin reports 
that Sanford proposed at the Bella Italia Grill in the upscale Palermo 
neighborhood of Buenos Aires. 

He arrived at the restaurant early and gave waiter the engagement ring in a bag and told him to make up a good story.

Sanford
then hid in the bathroom and watched as the waiter told Miss Chapur she
was the 100th customer of the day and had won a prize.

Sanford then emerged from hiding and surprised the Argentinian beauty. The pair gushed as they hugged and kissed and cried together in the restaurant. They promised to stay together forever, Clarin reports.

Sanford's soaring political career came to a screeching halt in 2009, when reports began questioning his disappearance for six days.

Aides claimed he was 'hiking the Appalachians' and was out of touch.

However, a reporter caught him at the Atlanta airport leaving a flight from Buenos Aires and he shortly thereafter admitted the affair.

Sanford said he met Miss Chapur, a divorced mother of two, during a trade mission in 2001 in Uruguay, though their relationship didn't turn romantic until 2008.

Sanford reimbursed the state for one previous trip to Argentina that had been billed as a taxpayer funded trade mission.

He was censured by the state legislature, though he avoided impeachment and stayed in office until January 2011, when his term expired.
