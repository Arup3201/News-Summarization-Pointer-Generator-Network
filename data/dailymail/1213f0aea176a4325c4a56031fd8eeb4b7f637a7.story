Three friends struck gold on a beach in Kent after digging up a 24-carat bar of the precious metal that an artist had hid in the sands.

Kevin Wood and his girlfriend Kirsty Henderson were the first to find one of the 30 gold bars hidden on Outer Harbour beach, Folkestone, by Berlin-based Michael Sailstorfer.

The bar they found is worth £500, but treasure hunters have descended on the beach in their dozens as there is still £9,500 to be found.

Hundreds of treasure hunters have descended on Outer Harbour beach, in Folkestone, to hunt for the gold

The artist hid the gold as part of Folkestone Triennial - an art project which takes place every three years. 

A total of £10,000 has been hidden, comprised of 10g (0.35oz) bars worth £250 and 20g (0.7oz) bars worth £500. 

The successful couple and Kirsty's sister, Megan, travelled to the beach from Canterbury after hearing about the gold rush on Twitter. 

Describing the moment he got lucky, Mr Wood, 28, said: 'My legs went from under me and I started shaking.

'I put it quietly in my pocket. We left the beach and half way home, we pulled over for a drink.'

Mr Wood and Kirsty plan to spend the money on a romantic weekend in Paris.

Megan and Kirsy Henderson and Kevin Wood were searching for the gold which is hidden on the beach as part of Triennial Folkestone - a public art project that takes place every three years

The couple had been digging on the beach the day before, and came back because it had been 'quite a laugh', Mr Wood said.  

'Everyone was there with metal detectors and I didn't think we would have much luck ahead of them,' he said.

'Kirsty picked a random spot and we kept digging.

'I was getting quite disheartened and I was ready to give up to be honest, but Kirsty was still excited and said we could find one.

'I carried on a little bit and it just popped out. I was quite excited.

'It wasn't very deep - it was only about 10cm down so I wasn't expecting to find it.

'It seems like a million to one chance with all that sand there and all those people going for it.'

The Folkestone Digs project, which ends on Monday, is part of the town's Triennial, which has previously included work by artists including Tracey Emin, Jeremy Deller and Martin Creed.

Yoko Ono is taking part in this year's festival, which runs from today until November 2.
