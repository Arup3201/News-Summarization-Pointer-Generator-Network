As a magician, he wowed audiences with tricks and illusions.

But Curtis Watson’s magic skills clearly failed him when he wanted to conjure up some quick cash – so he tried to rob an off-licence wearing a monkey mask instead.

The 23-year-old was jailed for 14 months after a court heard he demanded money from a terrified shop assistant, his face hidden by the strange disguise.

When nothing was handed over, Watson fled the shop and dumped the mask in a bin. He was arrested after police traced him through DNA evidence, and confessed. But he then fled to Tenerife to work as a magician while on bail.

Police tracked him using his Twitter and Facebook accounts and he was extradited back to the UK.Watson,
 who claims to have performed for celebrities including former 
Manchester City star Mario Balotelli and actor Ross Kemp, admitted 
attempted robbery and failing to surrender. He went into the Booze 
Busters shop in Macclesfield last March at around 1.30pm wearing the 
monkey mask, Chester Crown Court was told.

He
 confronted the lone shop assistant and demanded: ‘Give me the money!’ 
She replied: ‘No.’ He then told the woman: ‘I have been watching you. I 
know you have got money. I will come back later,’ before he fled, the 
court heard.

Sentencing
 Watson, of Macclesfield, Judge Ian Trigger said: ‘For all I know you 
are in the Magic Circle but you weren’t acting as a magician when you 
went into that off-licence. You went there in a premeditated attempt to 
steal cash.’

Bizarrely,
 weeks before the raid, Watson appeared in his local paper talking about
 his dream of becoming a criminal psychologist and using magic skills to
 fight crime.
