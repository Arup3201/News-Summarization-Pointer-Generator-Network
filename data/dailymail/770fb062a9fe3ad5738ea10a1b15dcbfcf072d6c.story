Louis van Gaal has launched the kind of attack not unfamiliar to Manchester United supporters, accusing FIFA here of dirty ‘tricks’ and a lack of ‘fair play’ by claiming that the World Cup fixtures give Brazil an advantage.

With echoes of Sir Alex Ferguson the Dutch coach, who will soon take charge at Old Trafford, complained that the host nation will play their final Group A match against Cameroon in Brasilia four hours after Holland meet Chile in Sao Paulo on Monday.

Van Gaal is angry that Brazil have played their first two group matches before Holland but will now have the advantage of knowing the identity of their likely second round opponents by the time they take on Cameroon.

If Brazil win Group A they will meet the loser of Holland’s encounter with Chile in the last 16 in Belo Horizonte on Saturday.

‘For every match FIFA have this advertisement around fair play,’ said Van Gaal. ‘FIFA plays these tricks and it’s not a good thing. It’s not fair play.

‘We’re going to focus on a victory against Chile and I don’t think that will be affected by the fact Brazil will play after us.

‘I am just assuming they (Brazil) will do their sporting duty. Why on earth are they (FIFA) doing that (with the match schedule)? That is the question.’

Van Gaal nevertheless claimed that Brazil would be keen to avoid a Dutch side that has already conquered Spain and Australia. 

‘I can well imagine that Brazil doesn’t want to face Holland,’ he said. We have scored a lot of goals. True. And we have we scored fantastic goals. True as well.’
