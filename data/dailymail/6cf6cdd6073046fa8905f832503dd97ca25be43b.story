When Piers Morgan asked Ed Miliband last year what he was like at school, the Labour leader hesitated, before answering timidly: ‘I used to be good at the Rubik’s Cube.’

He has been similarly reticent about his family, shielding wife Justine and their two young children, Daniel and Samuel, from the limelight.

But, with a series of polls showing that his ratings lag behind those of his Party and the Tory determination to target him personally, Mr Miliband has decided to shrug off his natural shyness.

A new film, dubbed Ed: The Movie by aides, attempts to highlight the human side of the self-confessed ‘geek’. 

The party political broadcast, to be screened nationwide on Wednesday, shows him and his wife playing with their children.

And it highlights his school days at a tough North London comprehensive, with Mr Miliband, 42, recalling how he used to dodge scraps in the playground.

Former classmates line up to praise his down-to-earth background, and say it will help him to be a good Prime Minister.

'Chatty': Mr Miliband, aged 12, in his Haverstock school days and he is a self-confessed 'geek'

The Mail on Sunday has also obtained Mr Miliband’s school reports, which show despite his excellent results he was no teachers’ pet. He had to be separated from his pals because their noisy antics were disrupting the class.

There is no mention in the broadcast of David Cameron’s progress from prep school to Eton or the Prime Minister’s Bullingdon Club days at Oxford. But the Labour message is clear: Ed is an ordinary guy, Dave isn’t.

Miliband’s science teacher at Haverstock School in North London in 1983, Mr Ashby, said of Ed, then aged 13: ‘Edward has worked well. His main problem  is he can be very chatty and argumentative when he is with his friends. I have often had to separate them.’ German teacher Miss Tenbeitel says: ‘Reached high standard in most aspects. More care, however, is needed with homework.’

The young Ed studied textiles at Haverstock. Teacher Miss Linden wrote: ‘Edward produced a good design for weaving, which has developed into an excellent piece of work.’

Mr Fry the music teacher said: ‘He has produced some excellent pieces of work. He should consider studying an instrument.’ Nine-year-old Ed’s report from Desmond Fawcett, his teacher at Primrose Hill Primary School, says in July 1979: ‘Edward is regular and punctual in his attendance. He can produce good creative writing, but in drawing and painting he is very unconfident. 

‘He can work on number work at a much higher level than most of the class. He has problems with his handwriting but there has been much improvement.’

Former Haverstock classmate Socratis Socratous says in the Labour film: ‘I hung around with Ed from the age of about 12. When it came to maths, the way his brain worked was incredible. 

‘He could look after himself in terms of getting out of tricky situations by using his brain. Anybody with Ed’s experience and background in that kind of school environment must be good for this country.’

A senior Labour source said: ‘We are not about making judgments on where anyone went to school, state or private.

‘This film is about letting people know where Ed Miliband comes from, the roots of his values and what drives him on.

‘Going to Haverstock Comprehensive in the Eighties was a big influence on Ed, as was his upbringing by his parents.

‘The more the public see of him, the more they like. 

‘The same cannot be said about Cameron. His decision to target Ed with personal attacks and spurious polls shows he is  rattled. It is desperation masquerading as strategy.’

'Comprehensive kid' Ed Miliband declares class war on Old Etonian Cameron

The political battle between David Cameron and Ed Miliband turned into a class war last night after the comprehensive-educated Labour leader targeted the Prime Minister’s Etonian background.

A TV film dubbed Ed: The Movie by aides, in which he talks of his days at the tough Haverstock School in North London and life with his  children and wife Justine, is to be broadcast on Wednesday.

The aim is to hit back hard at Mr Cameron’s decision to  target him personally as ‘Labour’s weakest link’ to halt the Tories’ slide in the polls.

Mr Miliband has decided to ‘fight fire with fire’ by highlighting his state school background and immigrant family roots compared with privately educated Tories such as Mr Cameron and George Osborne.

Labour believes that the rant at No 
10 police by Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell, who was educated at Rugby 
School, has made the Conservatives even more vulnerable on this front.

Details of the party political broadcast came as:

Mr Miliband’s decision to  ‘get personal’ with Mr Cameron is bound to be seen as high  risk. Labour claims the Tories’ attack on its leader is a ‘sign of desperation’ and shows they have ‘run out of ideas’.

The Conservatives even paid for their own ‘anti-Ed’ poll that  confirmed previous surveys suggesting Mr Miliband does not impress voters.

But Labour believes the Mitchell ‘plebgate’ row has focused attention on the Tories’ own weak spot: the privileged background of some Ministers.

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries’s claim earlier this year that Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are ‘arrogant posh boys’ was seized on by Labour.

Recalling his time at Haverstock School, the Labour leader says: ‘There were fights in  the playground. You learnt to  be streetwise and navigate  your way round. It felt like a tough school.’ The film also  features glowing tributes to  Mr Miliband by former classmates and teachers, and pupils who studied under him when he taught at Harvard University in the US.

However, playing the class war card could backfire – Old Etonian Boris Johnson is the most popular senior politician.

And when Labour activists in top hats were sent to target  privately educated Tory Edward Timpson in the Crewe and  Nantwich by-election in 2008, they scored a spectacular own goal: the Conservatives won their first by-election in more than a quarter of a century.

l Labour’s plans for the NHS were thrown into confusion  last night after Mr Miliband appeared to suggest he would not repeal all the Coalition’s controversial health reforms.

Challenged to say whether he would repeal the Act introducing the changes, the Labour leader said it would ‘not be  sensible for us to reverse it... and spend another £3billion on another top-down bureaucratic reorganisation’.

Instead, he stressed he was looking for a new ‘legal basis’ for the NHS, based on ‘co-operation not competition’.

But last night, a party spokesman insisted that Labour was committed to scrapping the Tories’ NHS reforms. ‘We will repeal the Bill,’ he said.
