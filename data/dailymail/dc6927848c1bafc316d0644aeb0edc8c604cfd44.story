An Italian long distance runner is facing disciplinary proceedings for allegedly using a fake penis to beat a dope test.

Devis Licciardi, 27, is said to have used a realistic-looking prosthetic containing uncontaminated urine to give a sample following a 10km road race.

The allegation echoes a farcical scene from the film Withnail and I, where the titular character tries to avoid a drink-driving arrest by passing off a child's urine as his own.

The Whizzinator: Advertised as a 'discreet synthetic urine device that is safe for all types of fun scenarios', the £87 gadget comes with a heating element and bags of uncontaminated urine to help people beat drugs tests

Licciardi, who is an athlete for the 
Italian Air Force team, was said to have been spotted by marshals at the
 event using the fake penis.

Officials
 at the country's Olympic Committee were immediately informed and he is 
due to face a disciplinary hearing in Rome tomorrow and faces a 
potential lengthy ban.

Licciardi is thought to have been using a device called a Whizzinator which is readily available on the internet.

Advertised
 as a 'discreet synthetic urine device that is safe for all types of fun
 scenarios', the £87 gadget comes with a heating element and bags of 
uncontaminated urine to help people beat drugs tests.

The ethnically sensitive product comes in a range of products for customers of various races including white, Latino and black.

The device could have been inspired by a scene in the seminal British tragi-comedy Withnail And I.

In the film a drunk Withnail, played by Richard E. Grant, tries to fool police who have pulled him over on the motorway by passing urine from a washing-up liquid bottle attached by a tube to his penis.

'You refuse everything but the urine sample,' he says. 'You undo your valve, give them a dose of unadulterated child’s p***, and they have to give you your keys back.'

Farcical: The invention is reminiscent of this 
scene in the Withnail And I where the drunk 
thespian uses a makeshift device consisting of a washing up bottle and a tube to try to avoid a drink-driving charge

The investigation into Licciardi was launched at the weekend after he ran in a race at Molfetta near Bari in southern Italy.

A spokesman at the Italian Olympic Committee said: 'An investigation has been launched and Devis Licciardi wlll appear before a anti doping disciplinary panel on Wednesday.'

Licciardi himself was unavailable for comment.
