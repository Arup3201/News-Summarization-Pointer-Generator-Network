Former Countryfile presenter Miriam O'Reilly who won a landmark ageism case against the BBC has attacked the corporation saying John Simpson has been given a new indefinite contract 'because he's man'.

The 57-year-old, who successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination after she was dismissed from the programme, hit out on Twitter after learning of the new contract awarded to the broadcaster's world affairs editor.

The 70-year-old journalist, who has worked for the BBC for more than 45 years, has been given the new deal that will see him work for the corporation for as long as he likes.

In an exchange on Twitter, Channel Five News correspondent Julian Druker sent a post to Miss Reilly with a link to a story about Mr Simpson, with the question 'Wonder what @OReillyMiriam thinks'

And just three minutes later, Miss Reilly replied simply saying: 'He's a man.'

Mr Druker then followed up with: 'I hope you've double-sourced this Miriam', to which she replied saying, 'Yes, I think you'll find that's accurate.'

On Twitter, Miss O'Reilly was asked what she thought about Mr Simpson's new contract, to which she simply replied: 'He's man' 

A spokeswoman for the BBC refused to comment saying they do not discuss staff contracts.

Miss O'Reilly was 51 when she was told in November 2008 that she was being dropped from Countryfile after eight years of co-presenting the Sunday lunchtime show.

She then took the BBC to an employment tribunal and successfully sued them for age discrimination saying she had been devastated when she was told she would no longer be on the show.

When asked if she had 'double-sourced' her information, she said 'Yes, I think you'll find that's accurate' 

The programme relaunched in April the following year in a Sunday prime-time slot with Julia Bradbury, 43 and Matt Baker 33, along with long-serving host 70-year-old John Craven.

In the wake of her victory, Miss O’Reilly was given a three-year deal to return to the corporation.

But in 2012 she announced she was leaving to launch a support service for women facing discrimination in the workplace.

Her Twitter bio now states: 'Journalist. Writer. Campaigner. Fought ageism at the BBC and won.'  

Earlier this year, Miss O'Reilly also hit out on Twitter at her Countryfile replacement Miss Bradbury after she disputed that the 57-year-old had been a victim of age discrimination on the show.

In an interview Miss Bradbury said that Miss O’Reilly’s departure from Countryfile in 2009 was simply a result of planned changes to the show’s format rather than discrimination.

But in a series of tweets, Miss O'Reilly wrote: ‘So you know better than three judges in a legal case and former BBC DG [director general] Mark Thompson who accepted the tribunal decision?

‘Before you make ill-informed statements I suggest you look at the legal case – one day you might need it. Until then good luck with the a**e licking.’

Miss Bradbury did not respond to any of the tweets.  

Miss O’Reilly then told the Daily Mail she believed Miss Bradbury was simply voicing the defiance of senior producers on Countryfile, whom she claims have refused to accept the employment tribunal’s 2011 ruling.
