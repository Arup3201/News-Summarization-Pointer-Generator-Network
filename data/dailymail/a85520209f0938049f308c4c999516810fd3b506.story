Taken at exactly the same spot in a sleepy rural village, these picturesque photographs are a perfect illustration of the unusually mild British winter.

Thirty years ago today, England's lowest ever temperature was recorded near Cardington, Shropshire - with the mercury falling to a staggering -26.1c (-15f).

Pictures taken from the same point three decades later tell a dramatically different story - with a daytime temperature yesterday of 10.4c (51f) as the country continues to enjoy one of the mildest winters in recent memory.

A Met Office spokesman said the daytime temperature in the nearby towns of Newport and Shawbury was even warmer - 11.2c (52f) - yesterday.

Bill Burrell noted the record-breaking low temperature at a weather station near Newport, on January 10, 1982, and says he remembers the day vividly.

'I had frost on my eyelashes,' the former Met Office worker recalled.

'I knew it was cold that day, but it came as quite a shock when I saw it was -26.1c.

'It had snowed the night before, but had cleared up and it was a lovely day - just bitterly, bitterly cold.'

That fiercely cold winter of 1982 saw one of the most disruptive snowstorms
on record - with gale force winds and severe
blizzards across southern England, the Midlands and Wales.

Thirty years later, things could 
hardly be different - with forecasters saying 
there is no sign of a blanket of snow or a big freeze for at least the 
next couple of weeks.

The mild weather can be seen in every 
corner of the British countryside, with snowdrops already blooming and 
daffodil shoots bravely starting to appear.Â 

Met Office spokeswoman Alison Richards said: 'The mild westerly flow from the Atlantic has been unimpeded - allowing milder Atlantic air and changeable, often stormy, conditions to take charge.'

The Shropshire record is viewed by 
many experts 
as an odd one for the county as its climate is 
generally moderate with an average minimum temperature of just 5.20c.

However, its rural and inland location means temperatures have been 
known to fall dramatically on clear winter nights.
