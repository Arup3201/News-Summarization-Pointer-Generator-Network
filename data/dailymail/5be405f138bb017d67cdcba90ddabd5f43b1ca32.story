It is one of the great old names on the British High Street with a history spanning more than 160 years.

But department store House of Fraser could be set to fall in to Chinese hands, with a conglomerate from the Far Eastern superpower yesterday said to have tabled a £450million bid for the chain.

Nanjing-based Sanpower is in advanced talks over a surprise swoop for the UK high street chain, which has 60 branches.

The discussions have been taking place as House of Fraser, which opened its first store selling cloth and fabric in Glasgow in 1869, also considers a separate plan for a summer flotation on the London Stock Exchange.

Sanpower has more than 100 businesses in mainland China, including shopping centres, but is little known beyond the vast country.

It is believed that Sanpower's offer has already been accepted by House of Fraser chairman Don McCarthy, whose family control 20 per cent of the UK company.

The proposals are now being presented to other shareholders, including Icelandic banks and Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter, who holds a stake amounting to 11 per cent.

He already has a £180m fortune, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, helped by the sale of retail chains Shoe Studio and Aurum.

House of Fraser, which generates sales of £1.2 billion a year and employs 7,300 people as well as 12,000 concession staff at 60 stores, has held a protracted search for new investors in the last year and recently closed its branch in Northampton.

France's Galeries Lafayette, which has 65 stores, had exclusivity on talks with House of Fraser until the end of January. The chain is also believed to have held informal takeover talks with Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley.

The department store retailer first listed on the stock market in 1948 and remained a public company until it was bought by Mohamed al-Fayed in 1985.

It was listed again in 1994 before being snapped up in 2006 by a group of investors led by Icelandic tycoon Jon Asgeir Johannesson's Baugur Group in a £350 million deal.

Sanpower is run by tycoon Yuan Yafei, whose empire spreads across finance, property, media, transport and IT and now employs 30,000 people with assets worth nearly £5 billion.

Today's report said the business is planning to inject £70 million to £80 million into House of Fraser in order to finance a wide-ranging store revamp and website improvements.

The tycoon may also take the department store into China by opening new stores or changing some existing sites to the House of Fraser name.

House of Fraser declined to comment yesterday.
