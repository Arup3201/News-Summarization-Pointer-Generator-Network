A 12-year-old girl barred from playing football for her school because of her gender is fighting back with the help of a civil liberties group.

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is throwing its weight behind the case of Makhaela Jenkins whose local authority claims it is not being sexist because there are other sports girls can do instead of football.

Makhaela already plays youth football in the Baltimore area, south east of Columbus, Ohio, but is not allowed to join the active roster for her school team because of her gender.

Barred: Youth footballer Makhaela Jenkins, 12, is fighting an Ohio district policy that bans her from playing football for her school

The district's policy is that only boys can participate in football games and contact drills.

According to Fox 28 Columbus, the ACLU has written to the school and labelled its principles as being old-fashioned.

Jennifer Martinez Atzberger, ACLU of Ohio senior staff attorney, quoted by the news service, said: 'This school is using outdated and untrue stereotypes about gender to decide who participates in athletics.'

She added: 'Federal courts in Ohio have made it clear since the 1970’s that if a girl wants to play football, and there is not an equivalent team for girls, she must be allowed to try out for the boys' team.'

Makhaela, who has been playing mixed youth football for some time and has earned her place in the team, is popular with the coach and has earned the blessing of her family, also has the law on her side, Atzberger pointed out to Fox 28.

The ACLU member highlighted a similar 1974 case, Clinton v. Nagy, in which a family won a District Court case when their 12-year-old daughter was also stopped from playing football on a municipal team because of her sex.

Full Contact: Makhaela Jenkins has been playing youth football but her school will not allow her to play for its team.

The letter was sent yesterday to Liberty Union-Thurston School District.

Quoted in a Fox News article, the district's superintendent Paul Mathews claims their policy does not infringe any gender-related violations because the district offers other, non-contact sports for girls.

'We have opportunities for girls, but those opportunities do not include contact sports,' he told Fox News.

The school district's board members have not yet publicly responded to the ACLU's letter, the news service said.
