A temp is suing the agency which sent him to work at a factory where he sliced off his genitalia in a foam-cutting machine.

Edgardo Toucet claims the accident has prevented him from working since and been forced to undergo treatments such as hormone therapy.

He blames his supervisor at Spartan Staffing for the mishap, saying she should have taken into account the fact that Toucet cannot speak English while training him.

Toucet's accident came in January 2010, after Spartan placed him in a job at Future Foam, a foam-cutting factory near Orlando, Florida.

He was helping to operate the 'peeler machine', a machine with a sharp spinning blade intended to cut up carpet foam.

Accident: Edgardo Toucet sliced off his penis and testicles while working as a temp at the Future Foam factory in Orlando, Florida

According to legal documents filed last week in Hillsborough County Court, this machine presents particular risks to users as it is situated at waist height, does not have a brake and takes up to one minute to stop in an emergency.

Toucet claims that his only training in how to operate the machine 'consisted of directions in broken English and handsignals', as he was born and brought up in Puerto Rico and is not fluent in English.

The complaint says that the worker 'came into contact with the machine's spinning blade and Toucet's penis and testicles were completely severed'.

His lawyer Mike Valen told the New Times Broward-Palm Beach: 'It's a tragic story in which the man lost his entire package and his testicles. He's had multiple injuries, and now he's required to have hormone therapy.'

He added that Toucet was now receiving disability benefit as he was unable to get a job, and said: 'It's awfully embarrassing for him.'

The document claims that Spartan Staffing was aware of other workers receiving similar but less serious injuries while working at Future Foam.

Toucet is also suing Barbara Pidgen, an employee of Spartan who was responsible for overseeing safety training.

He is seeking more than $15,000 in damages for 'bodily injury and resulting pain and suffering, disability, disfigurement, loss of capacity for the enjoyment of life, expense of hospitalization, medical and nursing care and treatment, loss of earnings, loss of ability to earn money and aggravation of a previously existing condition'.

Toucet has previously launched a legal claim against Future Foam itself, as well as the manufacturer of the peeler machine - it is unknown what the outcome was.

Neither firm is involved in the lawsuit on this occasion.
