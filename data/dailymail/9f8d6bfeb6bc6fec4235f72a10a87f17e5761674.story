A Tasmanian devil was mysteriously found dead and may have been murdered at a New Mexico zoo this week.

Zookeepers at Albuquerque BioPark Zoo were aghast when they found Jasper the Tasmanian devil lying on the ground in a puddle of his own blood when they went to care for him on Wednesday morning.

Fox reports that Jasper was last seen alive on Tuesday afternoon.

Disappearing: A rare form of cancer is killing off the Tasmanian devils in Australia  so wildlife workers are trying to keep breeding the animals to keep them alive

Police are investigating the incident and believe that someone might have thrown a giant piece of asphalt at Jasper causing him to fracture his skull.

If caught, the suspect could serve jail time for animal cruelty. 

Jasper was one of about 600 Tasmanian devils alive in captivity today.

Zoo Director Rick Janser told Fox that a rare form of cancer is killing of the devil population on Tasmania in an Island off the coast of Australia.

In New Mexico Jasper died of an unnatural cause, not cancer, that is likely foul play.  

'It looks like there was a malicious intent and essentially our poor Tasmanian devil was killed, intentionally, by what seems to be blunt force trauma to the head,' Gilbert Montano, Mayor Richard Berry’s Chief of Staff, told KRQE-TV on Friday.

Mysteriously Killed: Jasper was merely resting in his den when an unidentified suspect allegedly hit it with a giant and heavy piece of asphalt

Montano told reporters that one of the reasons they were keeping Tasmanian devils is to create a breeding ground.

'The whole idea to have the animals here was to create a breeding ground,' Montano told News.

'We have all the nucleus in place to receive breeding population,'said Janser. 

'I don’t think this will impact it, but we need to look at our exhibits and know what happened.'

Because the Tasmanian is from Australia, the zoo will need to notify the Australian government.

'This is the first time we’ve had an accident that’s taken the life of an Australian animal,'said Janser to KRQE.

Visitors at the zoo are permitted to get a few feet away from the creatures.

Surveillance footage of the zoo shows two boys and a man leaving the animal's enclosure at around 4:30 p.m.

Police do not know the identity of the men spotted on film but they will continue to search fro suspects.
