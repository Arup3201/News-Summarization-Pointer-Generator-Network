Dotcom believes the decision against him was not fair, the New Zealand Herald reported. 

He indicated his defeat represents the 'sad state' of the US justice system.

He said: 'By labelling me a fugitive the US court has allowed the US government to legally steal all of my assets without any trial, without any due process, without any test of the merits.

'The asset forfeiture was a default judgement.

'I was disentitled to defend myself.'

The New Zealand entrepreneur , who plans to appeal the ruling, has an extradition hearing scheduled in June
