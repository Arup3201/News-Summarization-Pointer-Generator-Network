Whirring from below: A Japanese company has unveiled a pair of trousers with a built-in air conditioning fan

Sweaty bottoms may soon be a thing of the pastÂ  - at least in Japan.

A Japanese company has unveiled a pair of trousers with a built-in air conditioning fan.

Whether Western consumers will be willing to endure a gentle whirring from their underwear as the price for a bone-dry posterior.

The battery-powered fans also have another drawback - your trousers inflate in a manner that their creator describes as 'like a Michelin man'.

The Kuchofuku Air-Conditioned Cooling have two battery-powered fans built in, and direct cooling streams of air down the legs and into the nether regions.

The fans are built into pockets in the outside of the trousers, which are made of a polyester-cotton blend and come in Khaki.

Normally, sweat is produced and 
evaporates, causing a cooling effect - but clothes interfere with this 
process by trapping the droplets.

But
 the jacket, invented by former Sony technician Hiroshi Ichigaya, 
produces a layer of circulating air which enhances sweat evaporation.

The fans - four inches in diameter - 
are powered by AA batteries, which last for several hours, or by 
plugging into a computer using a USB cable.

The electrical parts can be removed for washing. The only drawback is the balloon effect caused by the air flow.

The Japanese seem to be very interested in keeping cool - regardless of any fashion drawbacks.

Triumph's new Super Cool Bra, unveiled in Tokyo, comes complete with gel pads which should be placed in the freezer for up to two hours before inserting into the cup area.

The bizarre piece of underwear, which comes in two different colours, is also adorned with a sprig of mint and miniature wind chime which offer a 'refreshing fragrance and sound', according to the maker.
