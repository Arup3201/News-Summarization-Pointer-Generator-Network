Fifteen miles above ground, a dizzying column of white light has pierced London's familiar night sky.

The source is a 49-unit art installation at the foot of the Houses of Parliament, unveiled earlier this week to mark the centenary of WWI.

Commissioned by the Mayor of London and 14-18 Centenary Art Commissions, Spectra is a collection of high powered search lights by Japanese artist, Ryoji Ikeda.

Towering over other landmarks, it will shine brightly above the capital from dusk until dawn on August 11 - seven days after being unveiled without warning.

Visitors are invited to walk among the grid of lights in Victoria Tower Gardens next to the Houses of Parliament, where electronic music also created by the artist is available.

Spectra is one of a collection of works commissioned by the Mayor of London and other organisations to mark the centenary of the First World War.

The dazzling light of Spectra, an installation of 49 individual spotlights at Victoria Tower Gardens, can be seen shining high above the Houses of Parliament and Big Ben  

A photograph taken at 800ft from the viewing platform at the Shard earlier this week shows the column's light towering over the London Eye and other landmarks 

A visitor captures the light of the column on an iPad while visiting Victoria Tower Gardens with scores of others on Wednesday night in its third evening on display 

Since appearing without warning at 10.30pm on Monday while the rest of the city turned out its lights, the column has attracted scores of visitors from all over London

Insects and night bugs  dance in the bright white columns of light which are thought to stretch as far as 15 miles into the air and can be seen from all over London

A group of visitors cast their hands over one of the 49 individual search lights at the installation. The lights' square bases measure 75cm per side and are easily transported to allow for the installation to appear in countries all over the world

A man squints while trying to take a picture of the lights which are organised in rows of seven across a 20m grid in the gardens behind the Houses of Parliament 

From the base of the column the lights appear to meet at some point in the air while a further afield view shows all 49 shooting directly upwards into the sky  

Flecks of dust and insects are made visible by Spectra's streams of light which shoot up above the trees in Victoria Tower Gardens and the rest of the city

Spectra was unveiled on August 4 while the rest of the city turned its lights out in homage to the words of Lord Grey, foreign minister in 1914 who noted the 'the lamps are going out all over Europe' on the eve of Britain joining WWI

Crowds gather beneath the installation on Monday after it was unveiled as the culmination of the national 'Lights Out' campaign to honour the Great War dead 

The spotlights, of which there are 49, have square bases measuring 75cm each side. They are easily transportable and took one week to put together in the gardens by the artist and his crew

Ryoji Ikeda performing at Sonar festival in Barcelona in the summer of 2011 

Ryoji Ikeda is Japan's leading electronic composer and visual artist. 

Based in Paris, he has produced 13 albums and countless compilations in addition to putting on visual art exhibitions across the world. 

Ikeda has also performed at musical festivals and concerts throughout Europe and Japan.  

The artist claims to draw on the 'essential characteristics of sound itself and that of visuals as light by means of both mathematical precision and mathematical aesthetics.' 

Handpicked by the Mayor of London's office and the 14-18 Now, the Centenary Art Commission, to work on the piece, Ikeda is considered one of the few artists in the world who successfully creates art through both light and sound. 

A spokesman for ArtAngel, who were initially approached to produce a light installation to mark the centenary, said: 'Our directors were aware of the artist's work and when approached and asked what we thought we should do we suggested Spectra.' 

The installation has appeared in other cities in the world such as Hobart in Tasmania, but in different contexts, she added. 

'It works well with the lights out initiative. The piece has been used before but never in a memorial context.' 

The lights' square bases are 75cm and are thereofre easily transported.   

Ikeda began constructing the grid at Victoria Tower Gardens on July 27, a week before the finished spectacle was unveiled to the public. 

James Lingwood and Michael Morris, Artangel Co-Directors, said: 'Spectra is an artwork sculpted in sound and light, a sublime combination of mathematics and architecture. 

'Ryoji Ikeda offers us an open invitation to look and listen and wonder.' 

Jenny Waldman, Director of 14-18 NOW said: 'This beautiful artwork is a symbol of hope. 

'At this UK-wide moment of commemoration, it is a testament to the endurance of the human spirit in adversity.'
