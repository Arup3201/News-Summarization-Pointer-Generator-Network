Lynette Williams, 54, has blasted police for not properly investigating her daughter's killer in 2008 when he tried to strangle another girl

The mother of murdered Georgia Williams has slammed the police watchdog’s decision not to probe why her attacker was let off for trying to strangle another teenage girl five years before killing her daughter.

In 2008 Jamie Reynolds was reported to police when he tried to strangle a girl after luring her back to his house on the pretext of a photo shoot, but was let off with a caution.

Now Lynette Williams, 52, says her daughter could still be alive if officers had properly investigated that crime.

Reynolds, 23, became the 50th person in the UK to be sentenced to life in prison after killing Georgia in Wellington, Shrops., on May 26 last year.

Mrs Williams said: 'In 2008, Reynolds basically mirrored an attack that he committed on Georgia, in that he lured a girl round on the pretext of helping him out with a project and then there was a violent attack where he attempted to strangle her.

'Thankfully she managed to escape, but it has traumatised her and it has totally changed her life.

'As parents, we feel that had it been investigated properly, we wouldn’t be in this situation.

'Obviously the young girl that was attacked has put in a complaint as she feels she wasn’t dealt with properly at that time and ever since - she was interviewed initially, then that was it she had no other contact with the police.

Reynolds was jailed for life in December last year after the judge heard he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in UK history to be given such a sentence

'I did get very angry with the police because I felt that if they had dealt with it properly in 2008 everyone would have known about his past, they would have known what he was like with girls.

'Obviously, I wouldn’t have let Georgia anywhere near him.'

Mrs Williams added that Reynolds’ stepfather had gone to the police with disturbing photographs he found on the boy's computer, but the police never acted on it.

The photos were of two girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and a image depicting pornographic scenes of a man raping, strangling and killing a girl, she said.

She said that photos of Georgia’s older sister, Scarlett, were also found on his hard drives.

She added: 'I want the police to change how they view these attacks, I want police officers investigated properly, which is why I want the IPCC to do it, not another force.'

West Mercia Police said it had referred its handling of previous incidents involving Reynolds to the IPCC in January.

A spokesman said: 'On Friday 14 March the IPCC informed us that their recommendation was that such an investigation should be managed locally by West Mercia Police.

'We take the concerns around these previous incidents very seriously and following the outcome of our referral to the IPCC we are reviewing their recommendation and how this investigation will progress.'

Today the police watchdog, the IPCC, has said it will not investigate Reynolds' earlier offence, and has instead referred it back to West Merica police for an internal investigation (pictured, Georgia with Reynolds)

IPCC Commissioner Derrick Campbell said: 'I have had the opportunity to look at the request made to us concerning the conduct of the police in relation to this case.

'After careful consideration, I have decided that the public interest is best served by West Mercia Police demonstrating that they are capable of conducting an open, fair and transparent investigation into this matter.

'If there are any findings of misconduct following their investigation, then one would expect suitable action to be taken.

'Following a local investigation the complainants will, if dissatisfied with the investigation, have a right of appeal to the IPCC and if necessary the IPCC will be able to direct further investigation.'

A separate independent review is also being conducted into various agencies’ involvement with Reynolds before the murder.

Georgia’s body was found in woodland off the Nant-y-Garth Pass in north Wales days after she went missing from her home in Wellington, Shrops., on May 26.

Reynolds lured Georgia to his house for a photo shoot, persuaded her to climb on a box and put her head in a noose for a picture, then kicked the box away, hanging her

School friend Reynolds was subsequently jailed for life for her brutal murder in December last year after Birmingham Crown Court heard he had the potential to go on to be a serial killer.

The twisted shop worker lured the 17-year-old to his home where he hanged her from a noose before performing sexual acts on her dead body.

He even set up a homemade gallows made from an upturned red recycling box beneath a rope which was attached to the loft hatch.

After taking a series of innocent pictures of the teenager, Reynolds persuaded her to stand on the box with the rope around her neck.

He then bound Georgia’s hands together before kicking the box away causing the pretty teenage RAF cadet to asphyxiate.

After she died, Reynolds - who hoarded hardcore ‘snuff’ movies featuring sexual killings - stripped Georgia and abused her lifeless body.

At the time Mr Williams, 55, spoke about how he and his wife were receiving counselling to help them cope with Georgia’s death.

After hanging her, Reynolds took pictures of Georgia's body before carrying out a sexual assault

2008: Jamie Reynolds, then 17, is reported to police after luring a girl back to his house with an offer of a photo shoot before trying to strangle her. He is let off with a caution.

Later, Reynolds' stepfather goes to the police with pictures from the boy's hard drive. They feature girls with nooses superimposed around their necks and pornographic images of a man raping and strangling a girl to death. No action is taken.

Sunday May 26 2013: Georgia is last seen by her parents at 7.30pm as she leaves the family home in Wellington, Shropshire. She tells them she is going to stay with friends.

In fact she went to Reynolds' home where he persuaded her to climb onto a box and place her head in a noose for a picture, before kicking the box away and hanging her.

He then took several pictures of her dead body, both clothed and unclothed, before carrying out a sexual assault.

Tuesday May 28: Georgia is reported missing by her parents after it emerges she has not stayed with friends.

Police arrive in the morning to a semi-detached house in Avondale Road, Wellington, and, according to a neighbour, break down the door to get inside. Neighbours say a Jamie Reynolds lives at the address with his parents.

Wednesday May 29: Reynolds is arrested in a budget hotel in Glasgow city centre by officers from Police Scotland on suspicion of kidnapping Georgia.

They also seize a Toyota van which Reynolds used to transport Georgia's body to woodlands where he dumped it, before heading north.

CCTV will later show he visited an Odeon cinema in Wrexham while her body was still inside.

Thursday May 30: West Mercia Police say the suspect has been arrested on suspicion of murder following 'developments in the investigation'. They stress that Georgia has still not been found.

Friday May 31: Police confirm it came to light yesterday that Georgia died at an address in Wellington, Telford.

The body of a young female found in woodland on the Nant-y-Grath pass, in north Wales, is believed to be linked to Georgia's disappearance. It is later confirmed to be the teenager.

Jamie Reynolds, 22, is charged with her murder.

December 2: Reynolds pleads guilty to murder at Stafford Crown Court

Mr Justice Wilkie remands Reynolds in custody until December 19 pending further psychiatric reports.

December 19: Reynolds is handed a full life sentence for Georgia's murder after the judge hears he had the potential to go on and become a serial killer. He is only the 50th person in British legal history to be given such a sentence.

In court it emerges that Reynolds began hunting for clips of women being strangled six years before the attack. When he was arrested police found 16,800 images and 72 videos of extreme pornography on his computer.

It is also revealed that he subscribed to the same 'snuff' website as Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins, featuring videos of murder pornography.

April 2nd 2014: Lynette Williams, Georgia's mother, blasts police for failing to properly investigate his earlier crime, saying their daughter's murder could have been prevented.
