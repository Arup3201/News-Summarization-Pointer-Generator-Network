With his maniacal grin and a hoard of body guards following his every move through an underwater cavern, Kim Jong-Un appears to have found a lair worthy of a James Bond villain.

But the North Korean leader hasn't stumbled on to the set of Dr. No, and is actually touring a renovated children's camp.

The rather plush looking 'international' children's camp boasts its own aquarium, a swimming pool and football pitch - with places at the camp offered as a reward to the country's highest achieving students.

The Songdowon International children's camp in Kangwon province opened in the 1960s and has recently undergone a refurbishment.

And the 27-year-old looked delighted with the results as he walked around the complex - despite the aquarium appearing to be lacking any fish.

The camp is open during the summer for North Korean children who achieve particularly good school grades but also for foreign students for two to three weeks each July. It is unclear exactly how many international students it might attract.

Kim's visit comes after photos were released yesterday of him meeting a group of adoring female military personnel known as ‘airpersons’.

The women swarmed around him to grab on to their ‘Dear Leader’ in the first meeting of the female flying personnel of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) during a photo session in the capital Pyongyang.

At the event in the notoriously secretive country, Kim Jong-Un also sat for formal pictures with his generals and paraded past the assembled military.

The cheerful nature of the North Korean leader is in stark contrast to the latest dark speculation surrounding his leadership, as a national South Korean newspaper has alleged he may have executed his aunt.

Kim Kyong-hui, 67, is the widow of recently-executed Jang Song-taek, the uncle that Jong-Un who was publicly denounced as a traitor and executed last December.

Ms Kyong-hui has mysteriously disappeared from a re-run of a tv propaganda film, leading to speculation that she has been purged from her exhalted position, or even executed.

Scenes from the documentary show Kim Jong-un’s aunt in one scene, but she was cut out when the programme was aired again.

Miss Kyong-hui was last seen ‘in the flesh’ at a public concert in September last year - and while her name was among top officials at a committee organising the state funeral of a senior Workers’ Party official, she did not make an appearance.

Very happy: Kim Jong-Un appeared delighted with the results as he toured the camp after its renovation
