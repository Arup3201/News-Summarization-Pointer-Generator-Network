A ‘predatory killer’ got a ‘warped pleasure’ out of slaughtering a 16-year-old schoolgirl before turning up at her funeral, a court heard yesterday.

Claire Tiltman was on her way to a friend’s house in 1993 when Colin Ash-Smith, then 24, allegedly stabbed her nine times in a ‘frenzied and remorseless attack’ before leaving her to bleed to death.

Inner London Crown Court heard how the former milkman attended her funeral a month later with his councillor parents, wearing the same jacket he wore on the night of her murder.

The court  heard how 'controlling' Ash-Smith was photographed at Claire's funeral just a month after he allegedly killed her.

The jury were shown a photograph of him wearing the jacket he is alleged to have worn while carrying out the stabbing.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC also told jurors that he habitually carried a knife and was very reclusive.

He said: 'To those who came in contact with him, he seemed to be a very quiet, shy individual, something of a loner.

'However, he owned and habitually carried a range of weapons, including knives, about which he had an obsessive interest.'

He said that Ash-Smith 'savagely killed' Claire inside a dark alleyway on January 18, 1993 - just four days after her birthday - because he got a 'warped pleasure' out of her murder.

He told jurors: 'Her assailant had stabbed her no less than nine times in what can only be described as a frenzied and remorseless attack by someone having nothing less than the intention of killing her.

'Make no mistake, this was a killing for the sake of killing, carried out by a ruthless and predatory armed killer, who attacked his chosen victim rapidly and stealthily, allowing her no time for defence or escape, and who fled the scene just as efficiently as he had arrived.'

Ash-Smith was photographed at Claire's funeral just a month after he allegedly killed her. 

The court heard that he carried out similarly brutal knife attacks on other women - and plotted more.

He also allegedly bragged about his attacks in journals which contained details of his 'Assault Plans'.

In 1988, Ash-Smith tried to murder and rape a woman, stabbing her repeatedly in a savage attack.

Ash-Smith was just 20 when he attempted to murder his first victim 'by strangling her, and by stabbing her several times in the back, and he had attempted to rape her.

'She had been lucky to survive,' said Mr Altman.

Five years later he allegedly pounced on Claire, who he knew through family ties with the local Foreign British Legion club. 

'The killing of Claire Tiltman did not end his spree, because two and a half years later in October 1995, when he was 27, the defendant attacked and stabbed another local woman some 360 metres as the crow flies from where the prosecution say he attacked Claire Tiltman.'

He said that, like the schoolgirl's murder two years before, the attack was 'seemingly motiveless' and it was also 'a rare and exceptional event'.

Ash-Smith pleaded guilty in 1996 to these other attacks.

While in prison for the other two attacks he 'befriended a fellow prisoner to whom he confessed he was Claire Tiltman's killer', Mr Altman added. 

Jurors heard that Claire had been taking her mock GCSE exams around the time of her 'dreadful murder'.

That evening, she left home at about 6pm to visit her friend Victoria Swift who lived less than a mile away, and who she was going to talk to about college choices.

But in a decision 'that was to cost Claire her life' she took a quick detour to buy some cigarettes. 

She never arrived and was stabbed to death in an alleyway before staggering out bleeding onto London Road in the small town of Greenhithe.

Mr Altman said: 'People thought she had been run over by a car but they soon came to realise that she had been the victim of a terrible crime.

'Nothing could be done to save her and Claire died from her wounds on her back on the pavement.'

Michael Godfrey and another man, Ronald Wilson, were the first on the scene that evening.

Mr Atlman said: 'She was on her knees facing [a] low wall with her left arm draped over it. A small pool of blood had settled on the wall.

'Mr Wilson thought the person had been a victim of a road accident. When he saw that she was covered in blood he ran across the road to summon and ambulance.' 

Pathologist reports at the time varied in whether Miss Tiltman had been attacked from behind or in front and detectives remain unsure of how Ash-Smith allegedly pounced.

Mr Altman said: 'What may never be known, except to the man who attacked her, is whether Claire had entered the alleyway first and was then stabbed, or whether her attacker had dragged her in there and then stabbed her to death.

'Whichever it was, this was a brazen attack by someone with the confidence and resourcefulness to carry out a rapid, frenzied and ultimately murderous attack just off a busy main road.'

The court heard that Kent Police launched a massive and long-running investigation to hunt down Claire's killer, but Ash-Smith has always denied her murder.

Ash-Smith was arrested following his attack in October 1995, two years after Claire's death.

Mr Altman said police discovered Ash-Smith's 'Assault Plans' writings in which he bragged about his attacks - and plotted others.

Mr Altman said that in those notes 'he had written about the attack in 1988 as well as other planned attacks that he had not completed'. 

He said Claire's killing was an 'entirely motiveless attack', and Ash-Smith got a sick thrill out of her killing.

He said: 'There was no sexual interference and nothing was stolen from her.

'But to her killer Claire was a target for a completely senseless slaughter of an innocent young teenage girl, you might think for no better reason than the warped pleasure he derived from attacking a lone woman and the ultimate power and control it gave him.'

At the time of the alleged killing he lived with longterm girlfriend Stella Murrell, who married in him in prison in 1997 but later divorced, and has since died. 

Mr Altman said: 'They went out together and she found him controlling, but despite this the relationship continued and eventually they lived together.'

Ash-Smith denies the murder and has always claimed he has an alibi for the killing.

Jurors heard Ash-Smith was the son of former Labour councillor Diane and her husband Aubrey.

His mother doted on him and refused to believe he could do any wrong - even after he was convicted for the other knife attacks, jurors heard.

Mr Altman said: 'The defendant was... the golden boy in his mother's eyes who could do no wrong, even those offences of which he was convicted.' 

The fair-haired 46-year-old wore a pale pinstriped shirt and jeans as he sat in the dock flanked by three uniformed guards and stared straight ahead as details of Claire's murder were given in court.

He spoke only to plead not guilty to murder in a clear voice.

A group of Claire's old school friends sat in the public gallery as the historic murder case was opened.

Claire's parents, Cliff and Linda, never gave up hope that the killer of their only child would one day be caught, but tragically Linda died from cancer in 2008 aged just 56.

Plumber Cliff died in 2012, also from cancer, aged 63.

The hearing has been adjourned until tomorrow.
