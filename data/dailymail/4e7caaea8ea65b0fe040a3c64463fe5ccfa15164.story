Maddie Munden works as an official toast tester for Asda in Leeds, nibbling 50,000 slices a year 

For Maddie Munden a slice of toast in the morning is anything but a hasty breakfast grabbed on the way to work.

The 41-year-old nibbles on up to 90 loaves a week, chewing her way through 50,000 slices of bread every single year in her job as an official toast tester in a Leeds supermarket.

Ms Munden tastes bread to ensure it is suitable for sale, ranking loaves by their taste, density and smell.

And despite spending her working day eating toast Ms Munden insists the aroma of a freshly baked loaf or toasted slice of bread is still 'the ultimate smell.'

'Some people can't believe it when I tell them I'm tasting bread on daily basis, sometimes solidly from 9 til 5, but it's when the baker in me really comes out and having been in the industry for over 25 years, not much gets past me - only the really great stuff,' said Ms Munden. 

And despite eating bread on a daily basis, Ms Munden manages to stay fit by eating fruit and vegetables as well as going for an odd run round the block.  

Ms Munden comes from a baking background and began working at just 16.

Four years later Ms Munden was awarded Master Baker Status and now works for Asda in Leeds.

She added: 'I spend every waking minute thinking lighter loaves, bouncy buns and trends in breakfast treats, but bread is still one of my favourite foods.

'One of the most important parts of my job is making sure that our customers are getting the best and tastiest loaves and with over 300 lines in the in-store bread category, it's a full time job.

'We look at the life of the products and the density - I can't bear a heavy loaf.

'To me the smell of toast or bread baking in the oven is the ultimate smell.'

Ms Munden rarely eats a whole slice of toast, but instead usually takes a bite from the crust and centre to get the full texture.  

As part of her official tasting role, Ms Munden also has to keep on top of the latest trends in bread and toast. 

She said cornbread is one of the most popular varieties at the moment, as is a combination of healthy grains with white loaves. 

Ms Munden, who spends most days munching on toast, still insists that bread is her favourite smell 

The tester has been in the baking industry for 25 years and said baking is more a way of life than a job 

Ms Munden tastes dozens of slices of toast a day, but has managed to remain slim. 

She added: 'I try and stay fit by going mountain biking and also by doing the odd run around the block as often as I can. I also try and maintain a balanced diet, and eat a good mix of fruit and vegetables each week too.'  

And to add some variety to her tasting role, Ms Munden recently got to turn her hand to cookies.

In an average week Ms Munden might nibble through up to 90 loaves to test their taste, smell and density 

Ms Munden is involved in watching out for new bread trends as well as developing new products in store 

She said: 'It was nice to take a break from testing toast and taste the new cookies instead.

'I love being able to use my imagination to develop something the UK shoppers have previously been unable to buy in store. That's my favourite part of the job - seeing someone in store walk away with one of my products and I know they're in for a treat.

'I enjoy baking as far more than just a job - it's a way of life.'
