Rik Mayall's 2010 World Cup song has gone straight into the top ten of the UK singles chart after a social media campaign in his memory.

The track, which was originally recorded for the last World Cup, failed to chart the first time around, but thanks to support online it has gone in at number seven.

Actor and comedian Mayall, who died last Monday, said of the track in 2010: 'Football chants are one of the great traditions of following football and Shakespeare is also part of our national heritage.

Push for number one: DJ Jon Morter has urged people on Facebook to get the comedian's 'lost World Cup track Noble England (video pictured) to the top of the charts. It has gone in at number 7

'It seemed only natural that they should go together.

'I'm doing my bit, just like every other Englishman. As we stand shoulder-to-shoulder, doing out bit, stiff upper lip - apart from when you're screaming out the lyrics to Noble England.'

The campaign to get the song into the charts was kicked off by Jon Morter - the man behind Rage Against The Machine's victory over X Factor winner Joe McElderry in the 2009 Christmas number one race, the Official Charts Company said.

Mayall suffered from an 'acute cardiac event' after returning from a morning run, his widow said this week.

Barbara Mayall said her family had received 'thousands and thousands of messages of condolence' from around the world.

She said: 'We always knew that Rik was well loved but we are all overwhelmed by so many joining us in our grief.'

Patriotic: The song includes the re-enactment of speeches made by Henry VII. The track has jumped in the charts and his now at number 7

Meanwhile, former X Factor contestant Ella Henderson has described going straight in at number one on the official singles chart as 'incredible'.

And the official anthem of the World Cup, We Are One (Ole Ola), by Pitbull, Jennifer Lopez and Claudia Leitte is at 29.

More than 132,000 copies of Henderson's single Ghost were purchased in the UK over the last seven days, earning the 18-year-old from Tetney in Lincolnshire the fourth fastest selling single of the year so far, according to the Official Charts Company's sales data.

Henderson first shot to fame two years ago after appearing in the 2012 series of The X Factor, but despite being hotly tipped to win the show, she was eliminated in seventh week of the live rounds after going head-to-head with James Arthur who went on to win the series.

Ghost was co-written by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder, who has also penned tracks for the stars such as Leona Lewis, Ellie Goulding, Beyonce and Adele.

Speaking about her achievement, Henderson told OfficialCharts.com: 'It feels incredible. I just can't believe it. I've taken my time away, writing, and coming back into it with all this support is amazing.

'When you think about the people Ryan works with, it was definitely overwhelming being in the same room as him. He gets to pick and choose who he works with, and to say I got to write my first single with him is insane.'

Ed Sheeran slides one place to number two with Sing, while Tiesto is new in at number three with Wasted FT Matthew Koma.

It is the Dutch DJ's highest charting UK single to date. The top five is completed by Stay With Me by Sam Smith at four and Waves by Mr Probz at five.

Meanwhile, Kasabian have ended Sam Smith's two-week stand at number one on the official albums chart with their album 48:13.

Coldplay hold firm at number two for a third week with Ghost Stories, while Smith's In The Lonely Hour is down two to number three.

Former White Stripes frontman Jack White is new in at number four with his second solo album, Lazaretto, and Brighton-based singer/songwriter Passenger, is at number five.
