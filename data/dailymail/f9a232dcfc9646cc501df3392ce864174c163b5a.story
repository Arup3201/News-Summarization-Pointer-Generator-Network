This is the dramatic moment a drunk passenger is hauled off a Virgin plane by Indonesian troops after he allegedly sparked a hijack scare when he tried to break into the cockpit.

Looking bewildered and wearing flip-flops, Matt Christopher Lockley was dragged off the Boeing 737-800 after the jet was forced to make an emergency landing in Bali.

The 28-year-old Australian is accused of hammering on the cockpit door, forcing the pilot to send a mayday message that he feared the plane was being hijacked.

Lockley was handcuffed by the crew mid-air and placed in a seat at the back of the plane before being arrested when the jet touched down at the Indonesian island's Denpasar airport.

Police said they were told by a flight 
attendant that Lockley looked 'paranoid' and was demanding medicine.

Lockley, thought to be a plumber from Queensland, was due to have blood 
samples taken to test for alcohol and 
drugs.

'The police are having difficulty 
digging up information on what he intended to do because he is still in 
an unstable condition,' a police official at Bali airport told media.

Officials said his identification included a driving licence issued by the 
Queensland government, a licence to perform high-risk work and a 
Plumbing Industry Council card.

No decision had been made to charge him, but sources said it was highly likely he would be accused of causing an affray on an aircraft.

Police say they have accepted that 28-year-old Australian plumber Matt Lockely made a genuine mistake

The airport was closed for nearly two hours because of the incident, forcing several flights to be diverted, air force base commander Col Sugiharto Prapto said.

Mr Prapto said the plane was directed to park at the end of the runway in case explosives or weapons were involved. Scores of troops surrounded the jet.

Transport
 ministry official Herry Bakti said the alert was triggered when the 
pilot sent a signal to Bali airport that the plane had been hijacked en 
route from Brisbane to Bali at at 2pm local time (7am BST).

He then followed up with a verbal confirmation.

Held: The 28-year-old Australian is accused of hammering on the cockpit door, forcing the pilot to send a mayday message that he feared the plane was being hijacked en route from Brisbane to Bali

Arrested: Lockley has been accused of drunkenly hammering on the cockpit door on a Boeing 737-800 en route from Brisbane to Bali, forcing the pilot to make an emergency landing

Investigations: Police said they were told by a flight attendant that Lockley looked 'paranoid'

'We then guided the flight to land as they were flying close to the airport,' he said.

However, a Virgin Australia spokeswoman said the pilot had entered the code for 'unlawful interference' which was 'standard operating procedure, based on the threat they perceived at the time'.

The incident occurred on a public holiday in Australia when the country remembers its war dead in the ANZAC day commemorations.

While
 it is not known whether Lockley had been drinking before he boarded the
 plane, it is understood he had consumed alcohol on the aircraft.

The airport was closed for nearly two hours because of the incident, forcing several flights to be diverted, air force base commander Col Sugiharto Prapto said

Under routine precautions, airlines will not allow passengers who are clearly intoxicated to board a plane.

Earlier, Palani
 Mohan, a passenger on a Garuda flight that was about to take off from 
Bali, earlier described events when the plane made the emergency landing.

He said: 'The captain of my plane made an announcement saying we were
 delayed indefinitely because a hijack was going on in Bali airport, 
about 150 metres away from us.

'I saw at least five vehicles including military-style trucks, filled with men in uniform, rushing towards the plane.

On guard: Virgin said the flight landed safely and that the 137 passengers and seven crew were unharmed 

Alarm: Transport ministry official Herry Bakti said the alert was triggered when the pilot sent a signal to Bali airport that the plane had been hijacked en route from Brisbane

'Then
 the Virgin plane taxied away, followed by the convoy of security 
forces. The flight attendant said it's been taken off to a different 
part of the airport.

'Bali 
airport seems to be in lockdown, we've been told no planes will be 
departing or arriving. The pilot's not allowing anyone off our plane.'

But Heru Sudjatmiko, a Virgin 
Australia official on the Indonesian resort island, later said: 'This is no 
hijacking, this is a miscommunication.

'What happened was there was a drunk person... too much alcohol consumption caused him to act aggressively.'

The 137 passengers and six crew members were unharmed.

'The aircraft landed safely and at no point was the safety of passengers in question,' an airline spokeswoman said in Australia.

Airport operations in Bali have returned to normal, an airport official said.

Earlier, Indonesia's Metro TV had cited an Indonesian air force spokesman as saying the plane had been hijacked.

Hadi Tjahjanto told the television station: 'We got information that a 737-800 
from Brisbane to Bali has been hijacked.

Location: The Virgin Blue jet was forced to land at Bali airport after being hijacked en route from Brisbane

'The pilot indicated that the plane has been hijacked,' senior transport ministry official Harry Bhakti said on MetroTV.

'There's an information that a passenger tried to get into a cockpit, we are investigating.'

The airport was shut down for a time but after the Virgin plane was taken off the tarmac flights resumed.

Virgin Australia, also known as Virgin Blue, is the country’s second largest airline.

Started
 in 2000 with just two planes, within a decade it was expanded to serve 
29 cities in Australia and destinations in New Zealand as well as Bali 
in Indonesian, Phuket in Thailand, Abu Dhabi in the UAE and Los Angeles.

Based in Brisbane, it was set up Sir Richard Branson and Brett Godfrey.
