David Villa has graced the grandest stages of them all.

World Cup and Champions League triumphs sit proudly on a superb CV.

His spell at New York City FC may not be on the same level, yet the unbridled joy displayed at creating history with the new Major League Soccer side’s first ever goal on the hallowed turf of Yankee Stadium was there for all to see.

It was his presence which attracted a healthy and encouraging 43,507 here. And  it was his typically busy display which ultimately was the difference.

His first goal since moving to the US this summer was a clinically taken strike on 20 minutes and, on another day and without the seemingly impenetrable Bobby Shuttleworth standing in his way, the 33 year-old would have bagged a hatful.

Yet he still managed to retain his composure and cross for Patrick Mullins on 84 minutes to nab the killer second and prove the former Barcelona and Atletico Madrid striker brings much more to the table than just lightning quick reactions in front of goal.

Of course, it's not all about one man and, in truth, Manchester City’s newest fledgling entity were decent value after securing their first win against a New England Revolution side who were harshly forced to play with 10 for the last 23 minutes following Jose Goncalves’ straight red card.

City have aggressively marketed their brand new adventure in Manhattan, hammering home the fact that they – and not the New Jersey based Red Bulls – are the true team of New York.

The numbers swilling around outside before kick-off suggested it had done the trick. Yankee stadium, no matter how resplendent an arena it is, will never be a perfect fit for the beautiful game.

Yet NYCFC and their freshly conceived, enthusiastic fanbase did their best to make it feel like home. The makeshift pitch which has already got the baseball players fretting ahead of their season opener in three weeks time, was certainly passable.

There was a decent atmosphere though here in the Bronx. The rarest of sightings in this vast country - away fans - played their part too.

It was hard to gauge exactly at what stage Jason Kreis’ side were at in the opening day draw with fellow newcomers Orlando City. They are still in an embryonic stage after just a handful of games together.

New England, who were denied the title last season by Robbie Keane’s LA Galaxy, would certainly provide a much clearer yardstick.

And so it proved.

Villa buzzed around early on, teeing up frontman Adam Nemec who shot straight at Revolution keeper Bobby Shuttleworth before the Spanish was ace was denied on 15 minutes following a typical jinking run into the box.

The former Barcelona man was, by far and away, the most potent player on the pitch. And on 19 minutes came his first MLS strike. It was a classic Villa moment.

A sweet exchange with Ned Grabavoy opened up the visitor’s backline and as Villa bore down on goal, there was only going to be one outcome. His finish was assured, calm and clinical.

When Frank Lampard arrives in the summer, the added quality will ensure City will be hugely competitive. Yet in the land of single entity leagues and the desperation of ensuring level playing fields, weaknesses in other parts of the pitch are harder to plug. The home side’s defence looked particularly creaky with New England knocking on the door with increasing regularity following Villa’s opener.

The best chances fell to Juan Agudelo, the first on 36 minutes when a weak flick dribbled the wrong side of the post before he somehow headed straight at Josh Saunders from four yards out.

Three minutes after the re-start , the game should have been dead and buried. Twice Villa was set free, twice he failed to apply the finishing touch.

It was fast becoming the Shuttleworth and Villa show - the Revolution keeper brilliantly tipping over a fierce 12 yard volley from the Spanish superstar.

The visitors were soon reduced to ten men on 67 minutes after centre-half Jose Goncalves was handed a straight red for hauling down substitute Khiry Shelton. Yes, he was the last man. Yet contact was minimal if that.

It was left to that man Villa though to have the final say when he crossed for Mullins to make it two.

Villa has wasted no time in making an impact. He is already the big man in the Big Apple.
