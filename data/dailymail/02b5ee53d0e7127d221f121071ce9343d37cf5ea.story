The Newton County Sheriff's Office would not release information about the victim though it did confirm to the TV station the gunman's identity.

The victim was reportedly killed after being shot three times either walking into the church. However, another report claims he was in his car in the church parking lot.

'It just don't make sense,' a friend of the family, James Hanks, told 12 News Now. 'Because they are both good people. For real, they're both real good people.'

Scary scene: The victim was reportedly shot three times as he entered the Belgrade Baptist Church, pictured, at around 11 a.m.

The station reported that Curtis Jones had recently been released from prison and that he and his uncle had been in a feud long before the shooting.

However, family members said the younger man was attending his uncle's church to get his life back on track.

No motive has been released in the slaying. Police continue to investigate the death.

Kirbyville is a town about 130 miles northeast of Houston.
