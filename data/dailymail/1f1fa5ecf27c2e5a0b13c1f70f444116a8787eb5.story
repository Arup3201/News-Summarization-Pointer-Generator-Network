An auto shop worker has built an upside down truck that looks like a flipped-over vehicle.

Rick Sullivan spent six months and $6,000 building the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles in the car workshop he runs in Clinton, Illinois.

The road-legal car is created from a 1991 Ford Ranger pickup truck with a 1995 F-150 pickup truck body placed over the top - but upside down with the wheels pointed towards the sky.

Rick Sullivan designed the upside down truck from the parts of two separate vehicles, a 1991 Ford Ranger pickup truck with a 1995 F-150 pickup truck, in the workshop he runs with his wife Kathy in Clinton, Illinois

Mr Sullivan says when he first saw a Ford on its roof in his garage he thought it would be interesting on the road

It is designed to look like a red and white Ford pickup truck knocked on to its roof - complete with spinning tyres and a license plate that reads 'FLIPOVR'.

Mr Sullivan and his wife Kathy run a collision centre in  Illinois where he built the creation.

He got the idea for the subverted truck when he was called to transport an overturned Ford Ranger to his body shop.

When he saw the Ford on its roof with four wheels sticking up in the air, he thought it would look interesting travelling down the road.

Mr Sullivan said: 'I built the truck by starting out collecting parts for a Ford F150, we bought different parts in different locations.

'Then on the drive train it is a 91 Ford Ranger that I bought complete. We tore the body off of it and transformed the F150 upside down on to the 91 Ford Ranger.'

The vehicle attracts attention wherever it goes, causing drivers to stare and pedestrians to stop in the road.

Mr Sullivan estimated that a thousand pictures of the car are taken every day it is on the road.

'There's no blueprint - I just started buying parts and then putting it together.

'It's all in my head and we had to make adjustments throughout, but it turned out pretty much like I envisioned it.

'People are amazed, it's one of those things when you first see it, it's hard to recognise what it is but when you take the second look then they want to pull me over and take a closer look at it.'

Mr Sullivan didn't tell his wife Kathy he was building the truck until it was finished - when he took it to the dealership where she works to surprise her.

Ms Sullivan said: 'He just showed up at my job and called me to come outside. I went outside and saw this incredible creation.

'People were stopping in the street and it was a lot of fun.

'Rick is car crazy and his mind is always thinking about what the next project is going to be.'
