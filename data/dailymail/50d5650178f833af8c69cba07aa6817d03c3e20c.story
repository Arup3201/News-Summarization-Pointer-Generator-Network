This is the incredible moment an electric train full of passengers is struck by an enormous streak of fork lightning.

The train was travelling across a bridge in Tokyo as the stormy-looking sky flashed with lightning.

As the train gets half way across the 
bridge, a huge streak of fork lightning 
appears and strikes its carriages.

Scary: Passengers on the train must have been completely terrified as the lightning bolt struck. The sparks caused by the lightning bolt can be seen in this image 

Direct hit: This is the incredible moment a lightning bolt hit an electric train in Tokyo as it crossed over a bridge Â 

It causes a large flurry of sparks to
fly in front of the driver's carriage. The men filming the video can be
heard shouting out in shock.

Earlier in the day, another train was also hit by lightning and had to be taken out of commission.

Incredibly, despite the enormous lightning bolt, no people were believed to have been hurt on the train.

Lightning strikes are electrical discharges between the atmosphere and an earth-bound object, such as the train.

Frightening: Despite popular theories, a lightning strike is not usually responsible for causing multiple deaths or injuries

Despite popular theories, a lightning strike is not usually responsible for causing multiple deaths or injuries.

Injuries
and deaths occur when a lightning strike ignites a fuel source and 
creates an explosion. The resulting shock wave or fire causes the 
injuries, not the strike itself.

On Sunday, a bolt of lightning created what many have hailed as one of the greatest sports photographs of all time.

As Usain Bolt crossed the line to win 
the 100m at the World Athletics Championships in Moscow, AFP 
photographer Olivier Morin was in the right place at the right time to 
capture a lightning bolt strike outside the stadium.

With thunderstorms gathering around the Luzhniki Stadium, Morin sat in the first row of the photographer's tribune.

He set up five remote cameras near the finish line in preparation for athletics' showpiece race and crossed his fingers that he may be able to catch a lightning strike.
