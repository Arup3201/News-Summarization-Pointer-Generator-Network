Christopher Howard (pictured) was sentenced this week to three years of probation after he was caught having an affair with a student 

A married band teacher was sentenced this week to three years of probation after he was caught having a sexual relationship with one of his female students. 

Christopher D Howard, 35, was even named 'teacher of the year' at Jacksonville High School just a year before the affair with the unidentified student was revealed.  

Howard's actions are even more damning considering he appears to have been married at the time. Public records show he got married in 2007, and there is no evidence that he and his wife have yet divorced. The two were living in the same address at the time of the affair.

A deputy in the Onslow Coutny Sheriff's Office first discovered the relationship on May 23, 2012, when he found the two together in a parked car  in a deserted area. 

The student subsequently told detectives that Howard was her teacher, and that she had made physical contact with him that day by hugging him and kissing him on the cheeck. 

Upon a second interview, she admitted to having a sexual relationship with Howard. 

Howard also confessed to the inappropriate relationship when questioned by police. 

He said he was her teacher and had known her for several years. He says their relationship turned sexual after he helped her deal with some 'personal issues'. 

However, he said he had been wanting to end the relationship and had just broken up with her the day he was caught. 

That didn't stop prosecutors from charging the band director in 2012 with three counts of sexual activity with a student by a teacher and four counts of taking indecent liberties with a student. 

Prosecutors accused Howard of having sex with the girl multiple times, including once in the school's band room. 

This week, Howard pleaded guilty to sexual activity with a student and was sentenced to 36 months supervised probation. 

'Due to their hard work, this defendant will not be able to teach or be left alone with any more students,' District Attorney Ernie Lee told the Star News. 

Howard was named teacher of the year at Jacksonville High School in 2010- 2011, just one year before the relationship was revealed
