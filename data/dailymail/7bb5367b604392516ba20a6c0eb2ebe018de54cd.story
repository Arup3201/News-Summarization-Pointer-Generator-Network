Most heavily pregnant women think about putting their feet up in the final few weeks before giving birth.

But far from taking it easy, Martha Rivera has continued to indulge in her favorite pastime - a spot of alligator wrestling.

Despite being seven months pregnant, she carried on volunteering at a Florida rescue center, where she likes nothing more than getting into the water with the animals, feeding them meat and even climbing on their backs with her unborn child just inches from their jaws.

But Mrs Rivera, who also has an eight-year-old son, insists her hobby is no more dangerous than 'getting into a car and driving'.

She told ABC's Gloria Riviera in an interview for Nightline: 'I know my limits. I've done shows fully pregnant.

'It's no different than somebody who just happens to have a big belly.

'There's nothing like getting on an animal with the alligator close and front and personal.' 

Mrs Rivera helps with educational shows at the Everglades Outpost Wildlife rescue centre in Homestead, which rehabilitates injured animals before releasing them back into the wild.

When she's feeling particularly energetic, she will go to watch her son play soccer and then perform a show later in the day. 

She says it is safe working with the predators as long as you use the correct techniques.

And she notes that the animals are rotated to ensure they don't get stressed out.

She gave her final alligator show two weeks ago and is now on maternity leave.
