A devastated mother says Christmas was thrown into holiday disarray after her daughter's long-awaited gift from Santa Claus came with some ho ho hos - a cache of graphic porn.

Kanisha Morning, of Sacramento, California, said that her nine-year-old daughter had asked for an Android Zeki tablet for Christmas, and was thrilled when she unwrapped it on Tuesday morning.

But the enthusiasm turned to shock when her daughter looked at some videos that were on the device.

Shock: Kanisha Morning said her nine-year-old daughter had asked for the tablet for Christmas, and was thrilled until she saw the disturbing images

Ms Morning told CBS Sacramento: '[She had an] awkward look on her face.  At the same time I’m going to ask her what’s
wrong She’s handing me the tablet "mommy what’s this?"'

The station reported that the explicit videos appeared to be amateur pornography, shot in a house.

Ms Morning claims that she bought the tablet off Target.com because the big box retailer was not selling it in her nearby store. When it was delivered, she said it was 'factory sealed.'

When she contacted Target via their website, the store asked her to return the tablet for a new one.

Deception: Kanisha Morning claimed that the Android Zeki tablet she ordered for her daughter online was 'factory sealed' when it was delivered

But the mother told CBS Sacramento that no longer wants to deal with the company, and went to the media to prevent any other children and mothers from having the same experience.

She told the station: 'This could have happened before. Who knows how many times this has happened and no one said anything about it. Another one could be on its way to another kid.'

Target did not immediately return a call from MailOnline seeking comment on the incident.

Perhaps what's more disturbing is that Ms Morning's child is not the only child whose sense of excitement on Christmas morning was turned into confusion.

In Lakewood, Colorado, father Mark Giles was shocked to find pornography on a refurbished Nintendo 3DS that had been purchased for his son at a nearby GameStop.

Pornographic pictures, about nine in total, were discovered by his five-year-old son Braydon as he was trying out his new device on Wednesday.

GameStop apologized and gave Braydon a brand new 3DS, as well as a few games.
