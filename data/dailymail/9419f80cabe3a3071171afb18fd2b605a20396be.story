Hundreds of protesters braved heavy rain today to take their campaign for fuel duty cuts to Parliament.

Pensioners, cabbies, van drivers and hauliers were among those taking to the streets to lobby Parliament ahead of this month's Budget.

Organised by the FairFuelUK group, the protest included the delivery of a key report to 10 Downing Street.

Members of the FairFuel protest are calling on Chancellor George Osborne to cut fuel duty in his Budget

Pain at the pump: Prices have risen 15 per cent in the last year

From the the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), the report said even a modest cut in fuel duty of 2.5p per litre would create 180,000 new jobs.

FairFuelUK founder Peter Carroll said: 'It may have been wet today but we have been heartened by the fact that hundreds have joined our protest.

'We are hopeful that Chancellor George Osborne will see sense and cut fuel duty in his Budget.'

MOT failures are costing hard-pressed UK motorists an estimated £1.57 billion according to a new report yesterday.For failed vehicles now need an average of £143 spent on them in repairs before they finally pass the Ministry of Transport Test -- almost double the £82 it cost on average 18 months ago.The data highlights the increasing number of cash-strapped drivers who are trying to save money by cutting back on regular service checks and not purchasing new cars.

Almost a quarter of owners --23per cent -- confessed they just 'keep their fingers crossed' and hope that their car will pass, while nearly one in five --18per cent -- say they 'give a cursory glance around the car' before putting their vehicle in for the test.But the trusting to luck method does not seem to be working as over 40 per cent of vehicles failed the MOT in 2010, up from 37per cent in 2009 -- an additional 930,000 vehicles.Lights and signalling were the biggest cause of MOT failure in 2010 at 31per cent, followed by tyres at 20per cent, windscreen and visibility problems at 16per cent, brakes at 12per cent, steering at 3per cent and exhaust and fuel at 3per cent.

Geoff Dunning, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, said: 'The findings of this report prove, without shadow of a doubt, that there is an achievable solution to regaining at least some stability as regards fuel prices.'

The protest today came after latest figures showed new record highs for petrol and diesel at the pumps, with petrol having reached 137.79p a litre and diesel 144.92p.

Another report last week showed that UK drivers were paying the highest fuel taxes in Europe.

At Commons question time, Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls told George Osborne: 'A year ago you promised to get the economy growing and introduce a fair fuel stabiliser which would cut fuel duty when petrol prices were higher.

'One year on, you are now indicating you are going to press ahead with fuel duty increases, even though rising oil prices mean pump prices have today reached a record high.

'How can you press ahead when petrol prices are 4p higher than in last year's budget?

'What's happened to the stabiliser? Or isn't the truth you can't do the right thing on child benefit or tax credits or fuel because your plans have failed?

'A year ago you said in the budget you would 'put fuel into the tank of the British economy'.

'The fact is it's the economy which has tanked, on the hard shoulder, and this Chancellor is the one who has run out of fuel."

But Mr Osborne said: "There's an inconvenient truth which is the fuel duty rises you are referring to are the ones put in place by Labour, that you voted for and anyone who was in the last parliament voted for.

'That is the unbelievable opportunism of the Labour Party today.'

Turning on Mr Balls he said: 'One month it's VAT, another month it's child tax credits, now it's fuel.'
