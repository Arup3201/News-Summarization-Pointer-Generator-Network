A former pupil has managed to duck out of paying a £2,837 fine owed after returning a school book 65 years overdue - but has given the school a generous £1,500 donation for their troubles.

Sir Jay Tidmarsh came across the long-forgotten copy of 'Ashenden' by W. Somerset Maughan as he was clearing out his shelves.

The 82 year-old former businessman opened the cover and spotted the stamp of his old school inside. He had taken it out in 1950 when he was a pupil at Taunton School in Somerset and forgotten to return it.

Sir Jay, who was the Lord Lieutenant of Bristol between 1996 and 2007, decided to send it back - together with a £1,500 donation to the school library.

But, despite his generous donation, Sir Jay may have short changed the school - with the fine totalling around £2,847 for the 65 years.

Sir Jay, from Bristol, said: 'I don't know why but I just happened to open the front cover and was shocked to see "Property of Taunton School" printed inside.

'I thought I should do the decent thing and return the book - paying my dues at the same time.'

Sir Jay and his wife Lady Virginia made a special trip back to the £33,000-a-year school with the book where they were given a lunch in their honour hosted by Chair of Governors Jane Barrie.

Neil Longstreet, Foundation Director at the school, said: 'Sir Jay is a much valued supporter of the Foundation.

'We were absolutely delighted to accept the return of his library book, together with an extraordinarily generous cheque to cover the appropriate "fine" after a mere 65 years!

'Inspired by Sir Jay's actions, I am announcing an amnesty to all those other Old Tauntonians who harbour Taunton School library books on their shelves at home - I know I'm one!

'In so doing, we can raise further funds which will go towards developing the library.'

Ashenden is a collection of short stories about a gentleman spy which is said to have influenced Ian Fleming's later series of James Bond novels.
