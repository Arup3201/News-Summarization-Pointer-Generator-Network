Former president George H.W. Bush, who has been in a Houston, Texas, hospital with a lingering cough since November, may miss Christmas at home this year.

The former president needs to ‘build up his energy’ before he can be released, doctors said Sunday.

Methodist Hospital spokesman George Kovacik said in an emailed statement to the Associated Press that doctors are still optimistic that Bush, 88, will make a full recovery.

However, doctors but are being ‘extra cautious’ with his care, he said.

Bush is in stable condition, Kovacik said.

The 41st president was hospitalized on November 23 for treatment of a bronchitis-related cough.

Hospital officials have said he has been receiving physical therapy to increase his strength.

Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said on Thursday that Bush could be released in time for Christmas.

Kovacik said a discharge date has not been set, and that it remains unclear whether Bush will be able to spend the holiday at home.

Kovacik said that could be decided on Monday, Christmas Eve.

The past few weeks have brought high levels of seasonal sickness around the country.

Influenza activity continues to increase across the U.S., according to the latest report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

‘High levels of influenza-like-illness activity continue to be concentrated in the south central and southeastern regions of the nation,’ the CDC states.

Widespread influenza activity for the week of December 9-15, 2012, was reported by 29 states, including Texas.

Bronchitis, which Bush is believed to be afflicted with, is an acute or chronic inflammation of the bronchial tubes.

The flu is a viral infection affecting the respiratory system, including the nose, throat, lungs and bronchial tubes.

The two illnesses are not related, but are both more common during winter seasons when cold viruses become more widespread.

Flu seasons can vary widely.

Some years are very severe, with hospitalizations of up to 200,000 people and between 3,000 and 49,000 deaths during a season, according to the CDC.
