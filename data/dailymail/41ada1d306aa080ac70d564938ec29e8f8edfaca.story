A breathtaking new view of Saturn, showcasing the planet's rings, has been created by an amateur image processor.

Croatian computer programmer Gordan Ugarkovic assembled the image, looking down on the second largest planet in the Solar System, from 36 shots captured by the Cassini spacecraft on October 10.

Combining a dozen each of red, green and blue filter images the computer science graduate created the stunning mosaic.

Stunning new view of Saturn created by amateur image processor Gordan Ugarkovic

The aspiring astrophotographer from Croatia used red, green and blue filters to create the series of images

Emily Lakdawalla from the Planetary Society said: 'This mosaic showing the flattened globe of Saturn floating amongst the complete disk of its rings must surely be counted among the great images of the Cassini mission'

The amateur astrophotographer, who lists Zagreb as his location on his Flickr site, said on his profile: 'I'm a guy who does programming for a living, have a degree in computer science, but in free time I like to fool around with image processing.

'Currently my top choice of images to play with is the Cassini/Huygens missions to Saturn and Titan.'

Introducing the images on his page, he added: 'The images you see here are (more or 
less) calibrated images that were released to the Planetary Data System (PDS),
they are not raw jpeg processed images that immediately appear on the 
mission website as they're down linked from the spacecraft.

'I hope you find at least some of them interesting.'Â 

NASA's Cassini spacecraft was launched in 1997. Following the completion of a successful four-year mission in June 2008, an extension means it will orbit Saturn, captured above by the craft in 2005, until 2017

Emily Lakdawalla from the Planetary Society - the largest nonprofit organisation promoting the exploration of space - who spotted the images on Mr Ugarkovic's Flickr stream, told NBC: 'I try to be measured in my praise for spacecraft images.

'But this enormous mosaic showing the flattened globe of Saturn floating amongst the complete disk of its rings must surely be counted among the great images of the Cassini mission.'

NASA's Cassini spacecraft launched in 1997 with the European Space Agency's Huygens probe.

It's first four-year mission was successfully completed in June 2008 prompting a series of extensions, which will keep the craft orbiting Saturn and its moons until 2017.

Among the missions' most important focus is a study of the ringed planet's moons Titan and Enceladus, as well as some of Saturn's other icy moons.

Towards the end of the mission the study is expected to shift focus diving between the planet and its nine continuous rings and three discontinuous arcs, to gather information about the gas giant.

Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and second largest in the Solar System after Jupiter.

The planet was named after the Roman god who also lends his name to Saturday.

The gas giant has an average radius about nine times that of Earth.

While just one-eighth the average density of Earth, its larger volume means Saturn is more than 95 times bigger than Earth.

The
planet's interior is thought to be composed of a core of iron, nickel 
and rock surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an 
intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium and an outer 
gaseous layer.

The planet exhibits a pale yellow hue as a result of the ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere.

Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,100mph - faster than those on Jupiter but slower than on Neptune.

The prominent ring system feature nine continuous main rings and three discontinuous arcs.

They are composed mainly of ice particles with a small amount of rocky debris and dust.

There are 62 known moons - 53 of which are officially named - orbiting the planet.

Titan is Saturn's largest and the Solar System's largest moon - bigger than Mercury.
