An elderly Muslim cleric in South Florida has been sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for funneling tens of thousands of dollars to the Pakistani Taliban.

U.S. District Judge Robert Scola imposed the sentence Friday on 78-year-old Hafiz Khan, who was convicted in March of four terror support-related charges.

Khan was arrested in May 2011 on two counts of conspiracy and two counts of providing material support to terrorists.

Prosecutors drew on hundreds of FBI records of Khan's phone conversations in which he praised Taliban attacks  including the failed 2011 attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square.

Khan also tried to solicit money to finance the Pakistani Taliban from a man who turned out to be an informant - all of which was recorded on tape.

During the trial, Khan said he only pretended to support the Taliban so he could get the money to send it to his family and a school he helped found there.

'This is not supporting terrorist,' Khan's lawyer Khurrum Wahid said in his closing argument. 'This is an old guy running a scam, who got scammed.'

In total, the evidence showed that he arranged to send about $50,000 over three years to Pakistan and prosecutors said it was used to fund violent attacks against both the U.S. and Paksitani targets.

The jury didn't buy his story and found him guilty last March on all four charges, each carrying a maximum 15-year sentence.

Khan's two sons were also arrested and charged for funneling money into the country, but their cases were dropped due to lack of evidence.

Three others were charged in the case, but were in Pakistan and remain free as the country does not extradite to the U.S.

Khan was imam at a Miami mosque before he and two of his sons were arrested in 2011. He emigrated to the U.S. in 1994.

The Flagler Mosque is still running, but membership has gone down since the charges were first filled.
