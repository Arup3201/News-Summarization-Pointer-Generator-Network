Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, backed the sacking of two guards at Yarl's Wood in Bedford

Two guards at an immigration detention centre have been sacked for ‘sexual activity’ with a woman detainee, a report reveals today.

Two men were sacked as a result of ‘inappropriate behaviour’ with a detainee at Yarl’s Wood in Bedford. A third female guard was fired for failing to blow the whistle when the woman came forward, inspectors said.

Nick Hardwick, the chief inspector of prisons, said sexual activity with a detainee can ‘never be less than abusive’ and backed the sackings.

The centre is run by services firm 
Serco - which has come under fire in recent months over allegations it 
overcharged taxpayers for tagging criminals.

Following the sex abuse allegations, Mr Hardwick ordered more than 50 confidential interviews with detainees.

But
in his report, published today, he said there was no evidence of a 
‘wider culture of victimisation or systematic abuse’ at the 400-bed 
centre - which is Britain’s largest immigration removal centre for 
women.

His report also 
found 100 illegal entrants a month were found climbing out of lorries in
the Midlands alone. Some six hundred were detected and taken to Yarl’s 
Wood over a six month period.

A
police investigation into the sexual activity allegations was launched 
last month following claims from a 23-year-old Roma woman who was held 
at Yarl’s Wood. It is thought the woman has launched legal action 
against the centre.

Mr Hardwick said: ‘We were concerned to find that two staff had engaged in sexual activity with a female detainee, something that can never be less than abusive given the vulnerability of the detained population, and these staff had rightly been dismissed.’

The report said: ‘Before the inspection, two members of staff had rightly been dismissed as a result of inappropriate behaviour with a detainee, and a third had been dismissed because of a failure to safeguard the detainee concerned.

‘Steps had been taken to minimise the risks of this occurring again in the future, including a programme of training, but continuing vigilance was needed.’

Yarl’s Wood holds mainly single adult women and there is a short-term holding facility for adult men.Inspectors said more female staff were needed urgently as there were not enough for a mainly women’s establishment.

It also expressed concern that male staff entered women’s rooms without waiting for a reply after knocking.

Women said they were ‘embarrassed’ by male officers carrying out searches of their rooms and personal property.

A number of women at the centre were detained for long periods, including one for almost four years.

John Tolland, Serco’s contract director, said: ‘We are really pleased that this inspection report recognises the improvements Serco has made at Yarl’s Wood and considers it to be an establishment where residents feel safe and there is little violence.

‘Our managers and staff have worked hard to establish and maintain good relationships with the residents, who are vulnerable people in the middle of a distressing and difficult experience.

‘However, we are not complacent. As the HMCIP report says, we need to make further improvements and we are already working closely with the Home Office to implement their recommendations.’

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Detention is a vital tool that helps us remove those with no right to be in the country, but it is essential that our facilities are well run, safe and secure.

‘Safeguarding those in our care is our utmost priority and misconduct is dealt with swiftly and robustly.

‘We are carefully considering the contents of the report and will respond to each of its recommendations in due course.’
