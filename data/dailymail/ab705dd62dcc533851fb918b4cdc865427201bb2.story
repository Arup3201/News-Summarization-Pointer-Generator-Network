Musical superstars have offered to perform at a VIP party being organised for the man who was ridiculed for dancing in public - where he will be surrounded by thousands of beautiful women.

Pharrell Williams, Moby and Andrew W.K have all lent their support to the Londoner known affectionately as Dancing Man by telling him not to be ashamed to dance.

Two photos of him were posted online with the caption: 'Spotted this specimen trying to dance the other week. He stopped when he saw us laughing.'

The man who was pictured happily dancing in one shot - and bowing his head in apparent humiliation and dejection in the other - was tracked down thanks to a social media campaign.

The music lover who is named Sean and lives in London was identified after upset Twitter user Cassandra Fairbanks, from California, spotted the photos and asked other users to help find him.

The Free Thought Project activist manage located him within hours and 2,000 other women have now invited him to a huge party in Los Angeles where it is believed he will be the only man.

Pharrell, who has had number one hits with Blurred Lines and Happy, asked Cassandra to keep him informed about the party and tweeted to Sean: 'Never be ashamed of yourself.'

The same warm sentiment was offered by Moby - real named Richard Melville Hall - who offered his DJ services for free.

On Thursday evening, she uploaded the post her Twitter page, writing: 'Anyone know this man or who posted this? There's a huge group of ladies in LA who would like to do something special.'

Ms Fairbanks's tweet was quickly circulated on the social network, with thousands of users joining in her efforts to track down the Dancing Man. Before long, the hashtag #finddancingman went viral.
