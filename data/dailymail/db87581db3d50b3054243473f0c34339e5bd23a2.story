Fighting: Counter-terrorist teams fear two 16-year-old Muslim girls have joined ISIS fighters in Syria after fleeing their bedrooms in Manchester last week

Twin sisters aged 16 may have travelled to Syria to become jihadi brides, it is claimed.

The British citizens crept away from their home in the middle of the night and boarded a flight to Turkey.

The girls’ distraught parents raised the alarm after finding their beds empty when they went to wake them for college.

Police discovered their passports and belongings missing and established that they had flown to Istanbul. They alerted counter-terrorism colleagues when the ‘extremely religious’ pair contacted  relatives to say they were in Syria.

Officers are investigating how the girls paid for the trip – amid fears that it was bankrolled by jihadi fighters in the Middle East who want them as their wives.

It is thought the sisters, who have nine siblings, travelled to Syria after an elder brother went there to fight for Al Qaeda-inspired militants ISIS.

Mohammed Shafiq, the head of Muslim group the Ramadhan Foundation, said their ‘moderate’ parents were shocked.

He added: ‘I’ve spoken to the mosque where the family worship and others in the community where they live and people are saying they are a decent family. We know they have gone to follow their brother, but they are putting themselves in danger and I’m sure that the moment they arrive in such a savage country they will regret it.’

Sources said it was unlikely women would be recruited to fight and becoming jihad brides was the most likely scenario.

They admitted there was a risk they were being groomed as suicide bombers.

‘We’ve
 seized their computers and not found any videos or statements of 
intent, but are not ruling anything out,’ the source said. The sisters, 
who fled ten days ago, are of Somali origin and go to a sixth form 
college in Manchester, where the family is thought to have moved ten 
years ago.

Last week 
Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable for Greater Manchester police, who sits 
on the Association of Chief Police Officers’ counter-terrorism 
committee, warned young women as well as men were being ‘brainwashed’ by
 ‘perverted messages’.

He
 said: ‘We’ve got some information about girls trying to get to Syria 
and some we believe may have gone out there on the idea of being a jihad
 bride. So there are a number of absolutely perverted messages which can
 brainwash impressionable young people and parents are feeling  
desperate about this. It’s a bit like parents agonising about youngsters
 getting  into street gangs or drugs, but the  consequences are far more
 extreme.’

Greater Manchester police said they had a ‘line of contact’ with the girls and were working to bring them home.

‘The
 family are very worried,’ a spokesman said. ‘We don’t know exactly 
where they are but their parents are obviously very keen to have them 
returned home.’

Calls: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, issued a plea for the world's Muslims to 'obey' his quest for domination

As many as 
1,500 Britons may have travelled to Syria to fight. A number have posted
 messages online promising to use their ‘terror skills’ if they return 
to Britain.

On Friday, 
reclusive ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi made a rare appearance to 
order all Muslims to ‘obey’ him. A video of his sermon at the Great 
Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second city, went viral on jihadist websites. 
David Cameron has warned that jihadis returning to the UK after fighting
 in Syria and Iraq are ‘the most serious threat to Britain’s security 
there is today’.

Mr Shafiq 
said: ‘ISIS is a barbaric and evil organisation, which has no regard for
 human life and is contrary to Islamic teaching, and we urge people not 
to go out there to fight with them.’

Nawal
 Msaad, 26, was the first British woman charged with terror offences 
over the Syrian conflict. Msaad, of north London, was arrested at 
Heathrow in January as she tried to board a flight to Istanbul with 
€20,000 wrapped in cling film in her underwear.
