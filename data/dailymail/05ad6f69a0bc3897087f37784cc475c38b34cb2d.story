Bayern Munich chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has warned the Premier League to watch its back because the Bundesliga is about to overtake it.

The Bundesliga is currently third in UEFA's five-year rankings, but closing in on the Premier League all the time.

And Rummenigge has called on all German sides participating in Europe next week to pull out all the stops to ensure England's top division drops a position at the end of the current season, which is feasible.

'I think that the English are looking over to us with rather a bit of envy,' he told Sport1 television.

'They may have high income, but on a sporting level, they are losing a bit of attractiveness compared to the Bundesliga.

'Not long ago, we were fourth in the UEFA rankings and now we are third.

'We've caught up a lot on the Premier League in recent years and I'd like to call on all Bundesliga clubs involved in the Champions League and the Europa League in the coming week to get as many points as possible.

'We can overtake England this year and that would be a big slap in the face for the Premier League.'

While setting his sights on overtaking England, Rummenigge should perhaps also be wary of what is going on behind Germany.

Italy, which dropped to fourth in the rankings in 2012, when Germany secured a fourth starting berth in the Champions League at the expense of Serie A, have accumulated more points than any other nation so far this season.

Although they are not likely to have any chance of regaining third place for a few years at least, the fact Italian clubs have started to take the Europa League seriously with only one team - Torino - dropping any points on the first two European matchdays shows they are keen to close a gap which currently stands at over 11,000 points.

The Bundesliga is just over 3,000 points behind the Premier League with Spain's Primera Division still over 14,000 points clear at the top.

At the end of the current campaign, England will lose the 18,357 points it gained in 2010/11, while the Bundesliga loses just 15,666 points. Serie A will lose 11,571 points, enabling it to make up ground by keeping up the pace it has set so far this season.
