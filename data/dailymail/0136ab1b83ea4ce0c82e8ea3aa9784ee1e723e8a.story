Jailed: Kye Green has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for kidnapping his girlfriend

A jealous boyfriend tied his girlfriend to a radiator and threatened to carve his initials in her face with a razor blade because he thought she was being unfaithful.

Kye Green, who has been convicted of more than 100 crimes, was jailed for two and a half years for kidnapping Jade Kershaw and keeping her prisoner for an hour.

He tied the terrified woman to a gas pipe and a radiator, and she only managed to escape by cutting her restraints with a penknife and climbing out of the window.

Green, 26, became notorious when he was one of the first people get an Asbo in 2003, when he was just 14.

He has since racked up 102 convictions, with the latest coming at Grimsby Crown Court this week, when Green admitted kidnapping Miss Kershaw, 20, in August last year.

Jeremy Evans, prosecuting, told the court that the pair had been in a relationship for about six months, and they were living together at the time.

On August 15, they began arguing and he slapped her. Over the next few days, he bombarded her Facebook account with about 75 messages, some of them threatening, but she agreed to meet him near B&Q in Grimsby.

There he pushed her against a wall and held a razor blade near her face, the court heard.

'He accused her of being unfaithful and, despite her denials, told her he would carve his initial in her face to remind her of him every time she looked at her own reflection,' said Mr Evans.

'He told her that no one else would be allowed to be with her.'

After he punched her twice in the face she agreed to go with him to their house in Grimsby, and he said he would slit her throat then kill himself if anyone else turned up.

'He produced an iron bar - part of a bicycle seat - from his right sleeve and told her she was lucky he had not used it to assault her,' said Mr Evans.

Home: Green tied up Jade Kershaw at the house they shared on this street in Grimsby

At the house, he tied her legs together and used a penknife to tear bindings from an old flag.

'He bound her hands behind her back but she realised that the bindings were loose,' said Mr Evans. 'He threatened her that if she were to escape, it would "be worse" when he caught her. He told her that she was fortunate that he was not locking her inside the upstairs cupboard.'

Green went out to buy some cigarettes and tied a length of cloth from her feet to a gas pipe, as well as two more pieces to attach the knee bindings to the radiator.

He told her: 'I'm sorry I am doing this but I don't trust you. I know you will leave.'

After he left, Miss Kershaw realised she was locked inside the house but managed to free her hands and used the knife to cut loose her bindings. A male friend arrived later and she was able to climb out through a window.

The victim suffered injuries including a cut lip, bruising and a cut to her cheek, a sore tooth and swelling to her ankles.

'Jade Kershaw was petrified during the incident and said she has "never felt so scared in my whole life",' added Mr Evans. 'At times, she could hardly breathe and she did not know what the defendant would do next.'

Meeting: The pair initially met up at the Grimsby branch of B&Q before Green started threatening the woman

Green had burned clothes and shoes belonging to her. These were found behind the property.

His past offences included attempted robbery and assaults on prison officers in a young offenders' institution.

Russell Davies, mitigating, said it was a 'terrifying' incident and the use of a razor blade to threaten to carve Miss Kershaw's face was 'particularly terrifying' for her.

'He believed genuinely that this young girl had started another relationship,' said Mr Davies. They were 'once in love' but he became 'desperate' because he was losing her, he added.

After the hearing, the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'This man presents a serious and significant risk of harm to women.

'He is a violent, domestic abuser who intimidated his victim and sought to assert ultimate control over her when she ended their relationship.

'The victim displayed great courage and presence of mind in managing to escape from this situation and report the matter to the police.'
