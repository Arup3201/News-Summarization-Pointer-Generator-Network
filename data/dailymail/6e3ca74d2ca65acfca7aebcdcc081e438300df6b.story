As an oppressively hot and dusty Lord’s afternoon dawdled towards its concluding stages, Liam Plunkett found the edge of Cheteshwar Pujara’s bat and Matt Prior held the routine catch.

A slumbering Lord’s came abruptly to life. A spasm of relief ran through the England fielders, while Alastair Cook danced his delight, swapping high-fives and thumping backs.

At Plunkett’s next delivery, Virat Kohli shouldered arms, and the swinging ball punished his rashness by flicking the top of off stump. This time the reaction was clamorous.

His time is now: Alastair Cook must stand up and lead England to victory with a big score to even has a chance of retaining his captaincy past the second Test against India at Lord's

The ranks of egg-and-bacon striped ties came tottering to their feet. The drinkers in the Harris Garden pushed aside their fizz and hurried back to the grandstand. Cook danced with more urgency, bawled with more vigour.

Three overs later, a brute of a lifter from Stuart Broad took Ajinkya Rahane’s armguard and floated high behind square on the leg side, where the diving Prior plucked the catch. The umpire, deceived, lifted a finger, and the old ground erupted in a merry madness.

Three wickets had fallen for five runs in 19 balls. A match which had promised England only pain and extended suffering was now alive with possibilities.

When Cook looks back on his career as England captain, these are the moments he will treasure. Sadly, such moments have been too few, and the time for rueful reminiscence is drawing closer.

The termination of an England captain is not easily achieved. Whereas an unsuccessful football manager or an unpopular Education Secretary may be packed off in short order, the sacking of the cricket skipper is something akin to the defrocking of an archbishop.

It is done only after immense official consideration and wide-ranging public debate. Well, both conditions have been fulfilled and, even if England were to win a notable victory in this Test, the signs are Cook may not survive.

Can't buy a run: Cook averages just 24 with the bat in the last year and has not scored a century in 26 innings

Pondering: England coach Peter Moores stuck with Cook when he took over but must make a decision now

Alastair Cook will be glad to see the back of 2014, a year which has seen his England captaincy called into serious question. The opener has failed to hit a century now for more than a year and, as his team toils against India at Lord’s, Sportsmail takes a look at where it all went wrong:

January

Questions begin to be asked over Cook’s captaincy as England lose the Ashes series in Australia 5-0.

January

Cook captains England in the ODI series but is unable to make a big contribution as England lose 4-1.

January

England coach Andy Flower resigns but under-fire Cook vows to continue as captain and is backed by the ECB.

February

Fall-out from Ashes continues as the ECB axe batsman Kevin Pietersen effectively ending his England career.

May

Cook’s mentor Graham Gooch is sacked as England batting coach — on the captain’s advice.

June

More doubts are raised over Cook’s captaincy as the opener is dismissed for just 17 in the first Test against Sri Lanka. He scores only 28 in the second innings, before making just 17 and 16 in the second Test.

July

Dismissed for just five runs in the first Test against India at Trent Bridge, before getting out for only 10 in the first innings of secondTest.

To watch him at work on Saturday was to study a man painfully aware of his predicament. He stood hopefully at first slip through much of the long day, crouching as Broad or Plunkett, Jimmy Anderson or Ben Stokes hustled in. He would bring his hands together in supplication, watching the ball fly past to the keeper, then placing one hand beneath his chin while the other propped an elbow.

From time to time, he would exchange a few words with Prior, another England player on Death Row, if the rumours are true. Then, at the end of the over, he would gather up the close fielder’s helmet and jog dutifully to the other end. 

At one stage after tea, the entire England team gathered around the drinks waiters as Pujara was treated for a minor injury. Cook stood his ground, quite alone, staring into the middle distance. You never saw a man look quite so lonely.

It is said that Cook does not sweat. It is difficult to determine if that is a tribute to his glands or his temperament, but it is the reason why he is the fielder chosen to handle the new ball on its way back to the bowler. And yet, with the pressures mounting and the speculation raging, one imagines that the hands must have been more than a touch damp as India’s total took shape.

Nervous times: Cook could find his position untenable if England continue their poor form against India

You found yourself trying to recall other, equally unfortunate, captains: Bligh of the Bounty, or the chap who presided over the Good Ship Venus. But precious few have stirred the sympathy in the manner of poor Cook.

The ancients, in merciless mood, combined to criticise the skipper for his failings. Mike Brearley, most cerebral of former skippers, conceded that Cook was vulnerable. He understood, all too well: ‘You feel awful, you begin to doubt, and you need a lot of support around you,’ he said.

Geoffrey Boycott, more forthright, announced that Cook desperately needed runs in England’s second innings. ‘If he doesn’t, he should leave himself out,’ said Boycott. ‘It’s not helping the team.’

When men as different as Brearley and Boycott make common cause, then the writing is spreading all over the wall.

In fairness, Cook is being attacked for all manner of perceived failings, some of them quite delusory.

In this match, for instance, he has been pilloried for his ‘failure’ to reprimand his quick bowlers for their wasteful line and length on the opening morning. While a public rebuke might have been excellent public relations, one wonders why the bowlers themselves had no awareness of the appropriate plans. But once a captain is at bay, any stick will do.

Lack of support: Giles Clarke (centre) reacted angrily when asked about Cook's (right) future by journalists

He wears a faintly haggard look, like one who knows he is the subject of too many conversations, one who has overheard things which are certainly unkind but which might well be true. You suspect he is now listening to the critics; not the knee-jerk dullards who yearn for the restoration of Kevin Pietersen, but those who wish Cook well and have come to believe that a rest - hopefully temporary - would be the kindest course.

He may well score the big second-innings hundred of which Boycott spoke, but even that may not be sufficient.

In any case, what score would merit another Test, another chance? Sixty? Seventy? Ninety? The fact that we can indulge in such speculation is testimony to his plight. For the plot has moved on, and what was once mischievous speculation has now become a matter of time.

Through all his trials, Cook has handled himself with appealing dignity. He has concentrated on his team, probably at the expense of his personal form, and he is paying the protracted price. If he does decide to go - and the decision must surely be his own - then one hopes that his return will not be long delayed.

He is a considerable man and a considerable cricketer. And he will surely know better days, when he can dance his delight and flap his high-fives, and bring the champagne guzzlers hustling in from the Harris Garden, to join his England party.

D-Day: Cook must lead his side to victory with a big score against India to have any chance of keeping his job

The writing appears to be on the wall for Cook's England captaincy

@highlight

A big score in the second innings for England against India in the second Test at Lord's may not even be enough to save his job

If he does go then he can have a rest and hopefully come back refreshed
