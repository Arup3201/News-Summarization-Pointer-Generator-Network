In court: Julie Franck has been charged with armed robbery after allegedly stealing her own mother's engagement ring and cash

A pregnant woman helped an assailant to repeatedly shoot her own mother with a stun gun so the pair could steal her jewels and cash, a court has heard.

Expectant mother Julie Franck allegedly donned a ski mask to conceal her identity as her mother was attacked by an unknown accomplice outside her home.

The mystery shooter fired a stun gun around 15 times at Franck's 55-year-old mother outside a block of flats on North Marshfield Avenue, Bucktown, Chicago, on October 9th.

The pair then allegedly stole her $40,000 3.5-carat diamond engagement ring and $200 in cash.

Cook County bond court heard the pair also took credit and debit cards, theÂ Chicago Tribune reports.

A witness was able to pull off Franck's ski mask before the duo sped off in a Smart Car after the robbery, the court was told.

Franck's mother was treated for her injuries at Resurrection St. Mary of Nazareth Hospital.

Franck was arrested on Friday and has been charged with armed robbery.

Judge
 Edward Harmening held Franck in custody with $300,000 bail. Prosecutors
 did not say whether the second suspect had been arrested.
