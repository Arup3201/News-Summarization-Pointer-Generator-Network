Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush once tangled with a Miami Herald reporter over media coverage of his daughter Noelle's drug-related legal troubles, complaining in an email that 'I wish the media would leave my daughter alone.'

Noelle was arrested in 2002 at age 25 for prescription drug fraud, stealing pills at a rehab clinic, and possession of crack cocaine. 

A feeding frenzy of Florida journalists scrambled to report on every angle of the story, including links between a judge overseeing her rehab progress and a charity that received state government money.

The implication was that Noelle, who spent less than two weeks in jail overall, received special treatment because her judge appreciated the grants – $900,000 in all – made to the charity on whose board he had sat.

Bush wrote directly to the reporter in January 2003, and his email was part of a massive data dump he released to the public on Friday, redefining political transparency in the run-up to the 2016 election.

'LEAVE MY DAUGHTER ALONE': Jeb Bush emailed a Miami Herald reporter in 2003 to complain about how she was covering his daughter's drug-related court appearances

Noelle Bush, daughter of Florida's then-governor Jeb Bush, was originally arrested for trying to fill a Xanax prescription written to someone else

The trove of electronic data, more than 8 gigabytes in all, immediately attracted critiism, though, for the taxpayers' private information it contained. Daily Mail Online conducted a complete search of the data and identified 14 separate Social Security numbers.

Most of the emails containing the word 'Noelle' were from well-wishers, with a majority saying they were praying – many every day – for her. 

'It won't matter in the whole scheme of things,' Bush scolded the journalist on January 15, 2003, 'but I wish the media would leave my daughter alone. It would make it a whole lot easy [sic] for her to recover and live a life full of hope and promise.'

Pointing out what he saw as a tenuous connection between the judge and the government grants, the exasperated governor sniped that 'based on your definition of possible conflict, I guess I should not subscribe to the Herald so you and your colleagues can report objectively.'

'It is that trivial,' he added in a follow-up email after the reporter defended herself.

'The only reason you wrote the piece, or were told to write the piece, is that my struggling daughter is the child of the Governor.' 

Noelle Bush was first taken into custody at a drive-through pharmacy window while her father was governor in January 2002, charged with trying to buy the often abused anti-anxiety drug Xanax with a prescription written for someone else.

Although a judge gave her a break and sent her to an inpatient drug treatment program, and said her criminal charge could be dropped if she succeeded, she was caught at the facility with pills that had been stolen from a cabinet. She spent two days in jail. 

Back at the treatment center, workers found her with a 0.2 gram rock of crack cocaine concealed in her shoe two months later. 

In October 2002 at a progress hearing, a judge sent Noelle to jail for 10 days, basing his decision in part on news of the crack incident.

Jeb Bush learned of the jail sentence while campaigning for re-election. From the day the cocaine was found, through his daughter's sentencing, he played the part of compassionate father while carefully maintaining the tough-on-crime image that made him popular politically.

When news of the crack bust reached news media, he said his daughter needed to 'resolve in her heart and mind that she needs to change. She needs to accept responsibility,' he insisted.

'She knows that we love her,' the then-governor and re-election candidate continued. 'She knows a whole lot of people care for her, but it is up to her. There are no excuses.'

Weeks later when Noelle was led away in handcuffs to begin her short stint behind bars, he addressed the growing media frenzy again.

'As governor, but most importantly as her father,' he said, 'I know she must face the consequences of her actions.' 

In one email to a sympathetic constituent, he wrote: 'Thank you katherine for your sympathies regarding Noelle. I love her more than life.'

Florida's open records laws are among the strongest in the nation, meaning the emails released Tuesday – all of those sent to and from Bush's personal email address from 1999 to 2007 – have long been open to public review. 

They account for a sliver of the Bush archive, and don't include emails sent to and from his official government email address, as well as other records such as office notes and calendars.

But by cracking open his Blackberry for inspection on a new website, and pairing it with what amounts to a reader's guide to the hundreds of thousands of messages, many only a few words long, Bush is able to shape how the emails define him among his would-be GOP primary opponents and Democrats already trying to paint him as an out-of-touch businessman little different than 2012 nominee Mitt Romney. 

In a chapter of an e-book whose release accompanied the email data, Bush cast himself as being readily accessible, to the point that he freely gave his personal email address to constituents. 

'As much as I could, I emailed back,' he writes, describing the experience as 'quite humbling' at times, but 'always eye opening, and (it) certainly kept me on my toes.'
