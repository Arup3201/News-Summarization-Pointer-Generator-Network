Whether you're out shopping, waiting at a train station, or on your lunch break, you can now find the best local places to catch forty winks.

The parody map, called Google Naps, was built by a group of Dutch developers and uses Google maps and its Pegman to plot good sleep spots.

Each location is labelled with the type of nap - field, bed or bench - with extra details to promote that location.

Google Naps is the latest site to modify the mapping technology. 

Earlier this month a Swedish developer used the software to transform towns and cities around the world into urban jungles.

Using Google images, Einar Oberg built his jungle version of Street View to lets users virtually travel anywhere in the world, and see what that location would look like covered in trees, vines, and bushes. 

Oberg even redesigned Google’s iconic Pegman so he was holding a fire torch and wearing an Indiana Jones-style fedora.

There isn’t a search function, but users can navigate by zooming in and out of the map, and dragging the view around the screen using the mouse.

To view a napping spot, click the Pegman. A pop-up box will reveal the type of nap, the napper’s name, and why the location is a good place for a snooze.

Fields are indicated by a Pegman lying on a green rectangle, benches are depicted by a Pegman sat on a seat, while a Pegman under the covers indicates the napping spot that features a bed. 

Anyone can add a napping spot by clicking on the location and filling in the required details. 

Naps have been plotted across the world - and even in the Atlantic Ocean aboard a boat - but the majority are based in the developer’s home region of The Netherlands.

It was set up as a joke, and the developers have written an open letter to Google’s founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page that reads: ‘Hello, please don't be mad this is just a joke, a parody.

‘We don't mean to damage your brand or anything, we just want to bring a smile on the faces of Google fans.

The site works on Firefox, but because the nap map is laid on top of Google's existing maps, it is faster and more responsive on the company's own Chrome browser. It was set up as a joke, and the developers have written an open letter to Google's founders asking them not to sue

'So please don't take this to court, we only have a few hundred Euros in the bank. And we also don't want to go to jail because we're too busy with other things at the moment.

'But whenever you are in the Netherlands you can have a nap on our couch if you want. We can also make coffee and bake eggs if you like that (for a small price).’
