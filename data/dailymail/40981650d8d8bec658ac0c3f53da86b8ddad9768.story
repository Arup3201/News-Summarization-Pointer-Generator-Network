Tesco is to launch a budget smartphone to rival leading brands Samsung and Apple.

It hopes to replicate the success of its value tablet computer, the £119 Hudl, which has chalked up sales of around 550,000 since it was launched last September.

The smartphone, which will be unveiled ahead of Christmas, is likely to have a price tag of around £250 – considerably cheaper than a top-of-the-range iPhone which costs £709, and the latest Samsung S5, which costs £579.

A Hudl 2 is coming out in September, while the company also plans to unveil its budget smartphone ahead of Christmas, which will be considerably cheaper than the iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy S5.

The cheapest 8GB iPhone 42, on a SIM free basis is £348 and goes up to £709 for the top of the range 5s version, while the latest high-spec Samsung S5 is £549.

It seems likely that Tesco would have to charge less than £250 if it is make a big statement about its entry into the mobile phone market under its own name.

Some details were revealed by the retail giant’s chief executive Philip Clarke today however the retailer has not released details of the specifications or the price.

Mr Clarke has made internet shopping via computer, tablet and smartphone the main focus of his revival of Britain’s biggest retailer which is trying to turn around a two year fall in sales and profits.

It is believed the Tesco smartphone will use Google’s Android operating system and come with a number of Tesco services built-in, including internet shopping and Blinkbox, its movie and music streaming service.

The Hudl is made by the Taiwanese company, Wistron, which specialises in making devices for retailers to sell under their own name. It used to be the manufacturing arm of computer company Acer and makes a wide range of devices from PCs to LCD TVs and mobile phones.

Mr Clarke said: ’The opportunity in multi-channel retailing, in online retailing, is what led us to develop the Hudl tablet, and we’ve now sold 550,000 I think. Hudl 2 is coming out in September and there’s going to be a Hudl phone by the end of the year.

‘All are going to come loaded with the Tesco services - Blinkbox, the trilogy of music, movies and books that’s just launched, grocery home shopping, Tesco Direct, F&F Clothing and our bank account launches in June or July, and that’ll be on the smartphone too.’

A Tesco spokesman said the device would run on the Android operating system, and be benchmarked against other high-end smartphones on the market, but the company could not yet confirm a price or list of the device’s specifications.

A host of high street retailers have launched their own tablet devices over the last year, looking to cash in on the smartphone and mobile device revolution. Retailer Aldi announced earlier this year that it was relaunching its LifeTab, which originally sold out in less than 24 hours when it went on sale for £80 in December last year. Argos also moved into the market with the MyTablet device.

A report by research firm eMarketer in October found that tablets had now reached a third of the UK population, and more than 20 million of us use them on a regular basis.

Because of the move into the market by retailers like Tesco, eMarketer found that more than half the population would be using a tablet by 2017.
