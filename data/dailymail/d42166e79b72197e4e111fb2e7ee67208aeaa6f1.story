A solicitor from Croydon who wasn't content on just having a successful 9 to 5 career has certainly become high flying in her spare time too, as a champion cheer leader.

Chantelle Gough's top job sees her battling for clients in court and working long hours for a medical negligence firm.

But she's just as skilled at winning cases as she is at winning cheerleading trophies and has just returned from competing at the World Championships in Florida.

As well as being a lawyer Chantelle dedicates her spare time to her cheerleading

Chantelle, 27, took up cheerleading aged 16 after years of gymnastics and cheered her way through her degree at the University of Essex.

She even set up her own squad the Sparks Elite and her current team the Surrey Starlets were crowned national champions in 2013.

Last year she finally achieved her dream of attending the World Championships where her team placed 5th and they were back again for a second time this April.

But all the while, Chantelle was living a parallel life as an ambitious young lawyer.

Her dream of working in court as a top level solicitor has finally come true and she now battles to get compensation for people who have suffered from medical negligence.

Despite her double life she was anxious about telling some colleagues about her hobby in case they looked down on her unusual extra-curricular activity.

Thankfully, most of her workmates couldn't be more understanding, even if they are a bit surprised when she pulls her uniform out of her bag among piles of legal papers and law books.

Her busy life means Chantelle regularly dashes from court with her trainers under her arm and her backpack over her shoulders on the way to training up to five times a week.

Likewise, when at competitions she's rarely without her laptop and phone as she never lets either of her passions take a back seat.

Chantelle said: 'It is hard to juggle both sometimes but I couldn't give up either - I love law and cheerleading too much - It's both my dreams come true at once.

Chantelle often has to switch quickly between cheerleading and her job as a lawyer

'If I'm court the next day I often come back from training and then end up working in the breaks or late at night when I get in but it's worth it.

'I often have to switch quickly between the two.

'Sometimes it will be as quick a transformation as taking a witness statement or leaning over to counsel to give instructions one minute, and changing into my trainers the next.

'Most people at work know about my secret hobby but people were very sceptical at the beginning.

'I didn't tell some of the partners because I didn't want to be put in the bimbo box, but I'm proud to be showing that cheerleaders care more about the skimpy outfits and the fake tan.

'It's very athletic and I've had everything from broken fingers to bruised cheeks doing the lifts and tumbles that make up our routines.

'Although if I could run around in trainers all day that would be great but instead it's heels and a black suit for my 9-to-5 and then my purple sparkly cheer uniform.'
