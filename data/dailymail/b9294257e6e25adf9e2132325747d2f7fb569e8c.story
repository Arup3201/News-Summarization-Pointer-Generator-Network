Hedge fund billionaire Kenneth Griffin, who is fighting to only pay his wife what the two agreed on in their pre-nup as part of a messy divorce, says his estranged spouse has already received $35 million in the break-up.

According to a new report in The Chicago Sun-Times, Griffin, 45 - the CEO of $20 billion Chicago-based investment giant Citadel LLC - agreed to pay his wife $25 million in their prenup, plus $1 million for each year they were married.

Having split after 11 years, Anne Dias Griffin has already accrued $35 million and has a reported net worth of $50 million, according to the newspaper.

However the settlement would leave her with no real estate titles or any of the couple's costly possessions, including an extensive art collection.
