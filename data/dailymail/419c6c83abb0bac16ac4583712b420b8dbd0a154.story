The eerie howls that pierced the dense forest were not the usual wildlife sounds that the residents of Turner, Maine, were used to.

Then, in footage captured by a 12-year-old boy, a large, dark, mysterious figure loped through the trees and across the path ahead.

Could it be, finally, compelling evidence?

Bill Brock launched his investigation after he received footage of a creature believed to be Bigfoot

 

Renowned 'monster hunter' and Bigfoot expert Bill Brock certainly thought so.

After viewing the two-minute video he decided to travel up to visit the boy who captured the footage - and even declared the clip the most convincing evidence of the mythical creature since the 1967 Patterson-Gimlin video.

He told Bangor Daily News: 'I’m not telling you that this is Sasquatch. I’m telling you we either have a bunch of things that are lining up to be the most convincing evidence since the Patterson-Gimlin video or this is a really amazing hoax.'

Mr Brock believed that his 12-year-old informant was telling the truth.

He said: 'This really terrified this kid. He was shaking. I’ve done enough interviews with people who say they’ve seen Sasquatch to know … he was scared. It was almost frightening to watch him deal with it.' 

The Bigfoot was supposedly using a track through the woods in Turner, Maine, pictured 

Monster hunter Bill Brock, closely examined several footprints, even measuring the length of the stride 

The video featured a tall gangly creature striding purposefully through a woodland clearing about 100 yards from the camera. Before the action, there are a number of piercing cries from the woodland.

Mr Brock said that the area of Maine was believed to be a particular hotspot for Bigfoots. 

He said: 'We think these things migrate through this area, and we are on the edge of what could be a migration pattern. It’s just getting cold, so these creatures are gonna be moving from way up from north where it gets snowy, down to the coast to go get some food.'

During his visit to the area, Mr Brock tried to recreate the movie, playing the part of Bigfoot himself in a pair of brown dungarees, so he could measure the size of the mystery creature against himself from the same distance.   

But as he began to apply his years of monster-hunting experience - via the TV show Monsters Underground - to probe deeper into the evidence, a few things did not add up.

When Mr Brock, left, was shown some 'Bigfoot' tracks outside the property he became more suspicious 

In a second section of video posted by Mr Brock (above), the youngster - whose name is not given - leads Mr Brock to a location close to where the sighting was made and, unsurprisingly given the covering of snow on the ground, the mysterious Bigfoot has left several large footprints in the snow.

The doubts begin and in a third video on the sighting posted by Mr Brock (below), he analyses the evidence with a colleague, and suggests that the footprints he had been shown were perhaps a little too perfect.

He tells his viewers: 'We basically took our time. Our job as researchers is to research and that’s what we did. We took our time and didn’t jump to any conclusions.

'I am always going to be transparent.' 

Mr Brock then tried to recreate the footage by walking along the same track, left, as the monster, right

After examining the footprints, Mr Brock is not entirely convinced that they belonged to a Bigfoot

Then he drops a bombshell that the boy had told school mates he faked the whole thing.

'I received a really strange phone call from a friend of the boy who filmed it,' he tells his viewers. 'This friend told his mom that his friend has faked this Bigfoot footage and how he has faked all of us out. That upset me when I heard that.

But he still appears to want to believe that the footage is genuine, saying: 'I still trust these people - I still believe they are being honest with me. I know the father is being honest with me at least.

'We were told that his teachers and his peers from school were giving him such a hard time of being a witness to sasquatch that he felt threatened. He felt he was being picked on and being bullied.'

Despite the chance that the entire video was a hoax, Mr Brock hopes that it may be genuine and said in future such bullying may prevent other Bigfoot sightings from being made public.  

He added: ‘This young man was bullied into saying what he videoed was faked.

'A lot of people will not come forward and talk about what they have experienced because they fear that they will be ridiculed.'
