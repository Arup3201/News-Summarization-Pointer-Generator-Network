A doctor has been charged with sexually assaulting a bedridden, 61-year-old female patient during visits to her home over a three-year period. 

Dr Charles S. Dehaan, 59, appeared in court on Sunday in Cook County, Illinois, where he was held on $250,000 bond. The doctor, who is married and has three children, was ordered to surrender his passport.

It is suspected that Dehaan, of Belvidere, sexually assaulted up to 11 other patients, Assistant Stateâ€™s Attorney Dan Calandriello said.

According to prosecutors, between 2009 and 2012, Dehaan would close the door to the woman's room and fondle her while forcing her to touch his genitals, the Chicago Sun-Times reported.

The woman, who has psychiatric problems, reportedly did not think anyone would believe her because Dehaan was respected daughter.

Witnesses later told authorities that the patient seemed distraught after the doctor visited her to treat her anxiety disorder.

A federal affidavit details other sexual assaults that Dehaan allegedly committed against patients. One widow was allegedly told by the doctor 'she needed a man in her life'.

The doctor's medical license had been suspended in January, according to state records seen by Sun Times. However he is still licensed to practice in other states.

The alleged victim said she was too scared to report Dehaan as she thought he would cut off her medical care.

He was charged with nine counts of engaging in a scheme to defraud Medicare from his Rockford practice. 

Dehaan has also been indicted for Medicare fraud, according to federal documents released in February.
