A furious single mother has spoken of her anger after council workers highlighted racist abuse scrawled on to her front door by covering the still-visible word with black paint.

Leona Jarvis, from Selly Oak, Birmingham, called the police after discovering that the word 'n*****' had been hacked into the door to her flat.

The council came to repair the woodwork, painting a black square over the graffiti - but the word is still visible.

Leona Jarvis, 26, was furious after council workers painted a black square over racist abuse on her door, but left the derogatory word still visible

The mother-of-one found the word 'n*****' on her front door in Selly Oak, Birmingham, on November 2

Miss Jarvis, who lives in the flat with her three-year-old son, accused Birmingham City Council of making the situation worse.

She said: 'I think it's disgraceful, disgusting. They've just drawn people's attention to the word.'

The 26-year-old student discovered the derogatory word on the green door of her Courtway House flat on November 2.

The next day, she called West Midlands Police to tell them of the racist abuse.

It is not the first time Miss Jarvis has faced racism in Birmingham, she said, saying she had hurtful words hurled at her while she was walking around a shopping centre recently, but the incident has left her shaken.

'I don't fear for my life, but I'm on edge,' she said.

Birmingham City Council say the black square was a temporary measure and that they will fix the door permanently soon

West Midlands Police believe children may be responsible for the abuse at the flat in Courtway House over the Halloween weekend

'When it was Halloween I didn't leave my flat over the weekend, so I can't be sure when the damage was caused.

'A police officer told me kids may have done it. I suffer from depression and this hasn't helped.'

Her shock turned to anger after the council's botched paint job, however.

Miss Jarvis said: 'If nothing else, it looks unsightly. But it singles my property out.'

Despite her experience, Leona wants to stay in the council block, her home for the last three years.

A West Midlands Police spokesman said: 'We take reports of hate crime very seriously and would urge anyone with information to contact us on 101.'

A council spokesman said: 'Birmingham City Council takes hate crime extremely seriously and in this case the immediate response was to paint over the graffiti as a temporary measure.

'We understand how distressing this incident must have been and will return to the property shortly to carry out more permanent repairs.'
