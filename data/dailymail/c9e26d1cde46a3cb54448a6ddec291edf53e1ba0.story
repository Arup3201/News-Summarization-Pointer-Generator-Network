After viewing photographs of Mr Balls’ challenge on Rob Merrick, former top referee Graham Poll said the portly Shadow Chancellor was lucky not to have been sent off. 

The shadow chancellor yesterday morning left an opposition player bloodied and bandaged after clashing during an annual MPs versus journalists football match at the Labour Party conference.

Mr Balls caught the Northern Echo’s Westminster correspondent Rob Merrick with a thumping forearm as they challenged for the ball during this morning’s game in Manchester.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls tackles journalist Rob Merick as they take part in the Labour MP's v Lobby Journalist football match this morning

Merrick was forced off the pitch after the clash and needed patching up before returning to the fray

This morning's game took place at Manchester City's 'Ethiad Campus' in the east of the city

Merrick, a combative central midfield enforcer, later took himself off to accident and emergency. 

Mr Poll said: ‘Had I been refereeing this match, I would have certainly voted Yes for a straight red card for Ed Balls.

‘As the pictures show, Ed deliberately brought his arm and elbow into the face of Rob Merrick – a clear foul and an obvious sending off.

‘But if you need further evidence, you only need to look at the blood that flowed after the incident.

‘Not only did we have a man representing the red of the Labour Party – his challenge left plenty of red on his opponent’s shirt and that’s why my card definitely would have been red for Ed.’

Mr Balls is said to have lost a stone since last year’s match, though again the photographic evidence appears to do little to support his case.

After the clash Merrick was taken off the pitch and patched up by the waiting St John's ambulance staff.

He returned to the side of the pitch before later getting back into the action.

Another journalist Graeme Demianyk, the Western Morning News’s political correspondent, was also forced off the pitch after being injured in a separate clash with Mr Balls.

Demianyk, who suffered a 'dead leg' in the incident, said: ‘The shadow chancellor is an uncompromising opponent. When running towards you at full pace, it feels a bit like you’re in the path of that out-of-control boulder in Indiana Jones.’

A spokesman for the journalists' team told MailOnline that there was no bad blood with Mr Balls.

He said: 'It was an accident. Ed is very combative player and there was no malice. 

Mr Balls has been playing in the annual fixture since 1994

'Ed is a bruiser in every respect, that is fair to say. But on this occasion he did not intend to injure Rob.'

The spokesman added: 'Rob felt a boom and then suddenly he was bust.' 

The match ended 3-1 to the journalists. 

Demianyk of the Western Morning News opened the scoring by bundling home from close range, before the Financial Times's George Parker doubled the advantage.

But a strike from political aide Dave Hodges sparked a shaky spell from the Lobby, and it took a goal from Matt Dathan of The Times to settle the issue.

It is the second year running the Labour team has been defeated in the conference showdown, which is supported by the Football Association and helps raise funds for charity.

After the match Mr Balls said he hoped Merrick had not sustained any lasting damage.

‘I was about to score a brilliant goal in the top right hand corner,’ he said. ‘As I steadied myself to shoot Rob came piling in from behind attempting to nick the ball and came off worst. 

Afterwards Mr Balls added to BuzzFeed News it was no way a horror tackle and he didn’t see Merrick until it was too late. 

He said: ‘If he wants to jump on the back from behind then he’ll have to do it a bit more carefully next time. But I do hope he’ll be fine.’

Merrick lifts up the winning trophy for the lobby team, with his injuries from the Shadow Chancellor  clearly evident
