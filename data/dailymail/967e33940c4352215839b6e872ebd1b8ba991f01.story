Members of the coaching staff at a New Jersey high school where numerous players on the football team were sexually assaulted by other players have been suspended.

The Sayreville Board of Education voted to suspend head coach George Najjar and four assistants, Edward Mish, Michael Novak, Mark Poore and Timothy Ballard, with pay on Tuesday evening. 

School board president Kevin Ciak said that the suspensions were in accordance with policy due to the ongoing investigation and that no decisions had been made about the future employment of the coaches, none of whom has been charged with a crime.

Community divided: Sayreville High parents and supporters (some pictured above at an anti-bullying rally earlier this month) have been divided on their opinions on how the school should treat the sexual assault and hazing of young players on the football team 

Seven members of the Sayreville War Memorial High School team were charged on October 10 with crimes ranging from hazing to aggravated sexual assault, charges that came to light after the parent of one young boy being hazed by his teammates notified authorities.

Their names have not been released because they are under 18.

Upperclassmen on the team were said to have held down the younger players on the team in the locker room, anally penetrating them with their fingers and then sticking those fingers in their mouths.

At the meeting on Tuesday, many were upset with the decision, and came to the defense of Najjar.

Volunteer assistant coach Robert Berardi, who was not among the four assistants suspended, accused the school board of not giving the coaches adequate training in anti-bullying policies.

'You failed on your end,' he said to applause from the large crowd in the school's cafeteria. 

'There's not one person here who is going to heal the wounds of this community; that person is sitting at home right now, and that's Coach Najjar.'

The board vote for suspension was unanimous, 9 to 0, a sentence that was initially handed down by the superintendent of the school district, Richard Labbe (above), last Thursday

Najjar, who has yet to comment on what happened, was not at the meeting.

The board also lowered the salaries of Najjar, Novak and Mish based on reduced duties because of the cancellation of the football season.
