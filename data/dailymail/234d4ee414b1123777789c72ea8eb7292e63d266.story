A pet dog was crushed to death by a 16ft-long python in front of a British mother and her two horrified young children.

Art dealer Katie Heyring was on a countryside hike with daughter Kaia, seven, son Kaspar, five, and their five dogs when the snake struck.

Charlie, a mongrel cross, had run ahead of the family along a path in Hong Kong’s Sai Kung West Country Park on Saturday.

Tragic: Family pet Charlie, who was crushed to death by a snake while out walking with its owners on Saturday. The family were walking in Sai Kung West Country Park when the 16ft creature struck

Mrs Heyring, 41, tried to fight off the snake by hitting the serpent with a walking stick but eventually fled with her children when she realised Charlie was dead.

The tragedy comes two weeks after a British couple fought off a python attacking their dog in another part of the same park.

Different snakes are believed to be responsible for the two attacks, which were five miles apart, but the latest incident was in an area where there have been three other python attacks on dogs in recent years, one of them fatal.

Mrs Heyring, from Windsor, Berkshire, deals in Vietnamese art and has lived in Hong Kong with her husband and children for two years.

They are planning an imminent return to Britain as their two older children are at boarding school in the UK.

Mrs Heyring yesterday explained how Charlie, who the family adopted from a rescue centre, was  killed by the snake.

Shock: Katie Heyring with another one of her pets. She said today the attack was 'terrifying'

‘It was massive,’ she said. ‘It had to easily be about 16ft because Charlie was a big dog of about four-and-a-half stone and he was almost the size of my Labrador.

‘The scary thing is that it happened so quickly, from hearing Charlie’s awful squeal and coming round the corner to being confronted by the horrific sight of the huge snake coiled around Charlie.

‘It was terrifying. The kids were screaming and the other dogs were barking. They were going ballistic.

‘After about a minute of me hitting it, Charlie stopped squealing and I knew that was it.

‘There was nothing I could do and I just had to get the kids and the other dogs away.

‘We are all very upset. Charlie was a rescue puppy. He was about 18 months old and a lovely dog.

‘It was a horrific thing to witness and to feel so helpless. I had my husband’s diving knife in the back pack because I had read about the snake attack the other week, but the snake was colossal and I was so scared it would turn on the kids.

‘My youngest is about the same size as Charlie. I keep thinking “what if my son Kaspar had been in front?”. What would the snake have done to him? It’s just too horrible to contemplate.’

Two weeks ago British expatriates Courtney Link and her husband Pete managed to rescue their 4st dog Dexter from the grip of a python which attacked as they walked around a coastal peninsula about five miles from the scene of Saturday’s attack.

There have been three other python attacks on dogs since 2006 close to the spot of the latest attack. Two were rescued but the third, a husky, died.

Briton Dave Willott, who works as a part-time snake catcher in Hong Kong, said it was possible the python which attacked Charlie could be the same snake behind the three previous attacks.

A python, similar to the one that attacked and crushed Charlie to death. The attack comes just two weeks after another British couple lost their dog to a snake in the same Hong Kong park

He recommended pet owners not let their dogs off the leash, as pythons were predators which lie in wait for passing mammals.

‘Many times people ask me what they should they do if a python attacks their dog,’ he said. ‘You have to really go for it. Grab it by the tail and start yanking it and walking backwards.

‘Pythons don’t like the idea of not being anchored down. It might tighten up at first but keeping pulling it by the tail and it will let go.’

Pythons are Hong Kong’s biggest natural predator and are protected under law. They can grow up to   20ft long and normally feed on small mammals and wild boar.
