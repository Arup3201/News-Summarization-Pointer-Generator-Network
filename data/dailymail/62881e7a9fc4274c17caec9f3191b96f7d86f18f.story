A US defense contractor has been killed and a second injured after a shooting at a gas station in the Saudi Arabian capital Riyadh - and it was all over a workplace conflict, Saudi authorities believe. 

Abdulaziz Fahad Abdulaziz Alrashid, 24, opened fire at the gas station in a western district of Riyadh - killing one contractor in his car and wounding a second. He chased the second American into the gas station before police arrived. 

Alrashid - who is a dual US-Saudi citizen - had recently been fired for drug use by Vinnell Arabia, a US defense firm that is working with the Saudi National Guard. It is believed the victims were his former supervisors, Saudi authorities said. 

 Alrashid was born to Saudi parents in Washington state. He had traveled to France, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, the United States and most recently Bahrain. 

The attack occurred about half a mile from the Vinnell Arabia compound and 20 miles from the US Embassy. 

The victim was shot dead by a gunman at a filling station on the eastern outskirts of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia 

It is understood a second US defence contractor ran from the car into the nearby shop, escaping serious injury

A third American contractor, who was following in another vehicle, witnessed the attack, but was not injured.  

Police cornered Alrashid in the gas station and wounded him in a brief gun battle. He was later apprehended and charged. 

Saudi authorities were quick to say that the attack was not terrorism related. Instead, they said it was the act of a disgruntled former employee.

Still, it rattled many of the thousands of Western expats who live and work in Saudi Arabia. 

With tensions in the region heightened due to conflicts with ISIS extremists in Syria and Iraq, and with Saudi officials concerned about rising domestic militancy, security at Western compounds is being stepped up.

'We will be heightening security around our compound,' said the manager of a Western residential compound in Riyadh.

Most security at Western compounds has been provided by the Saudi Arabian National Guard since a string of attacks on foreign targets a decade ago. 

'That area would be on my way to work and I'm in that area often stopping at local shops and buying things. I might avoid stopping there for a while,' said one US national living in Riyadh. 

Police said the attack happened when the two stopped their vehicle at a filling station in an eastern district of the capital.

Saudi security forces surrounded the gunman shortly after the shooting and arrested him after a gunfight

U.S. officials were in close contact with Saudi government as they gathered details about the shooting and a possible motive, the official said on condition of anonymity because the investigation was at a very preliminary stage and he was not authorized to discuss the case publicly.

U.S. authorities were also evaluating their security posture, and will take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of all U.S. Mission personnel, the official said.

In September, Saudi police said they had arrested 88 people suspected of being part of an al-Qaida cell that was planning attacks inside and outside the kingdom.

The attack happened on the eastern outskirts of Riyadh about 20 miles from the US embassy 

Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries are taking part in U.S.-led airstrikes against the Islamic State group and al-Qaida fighters in Iraq and Syria. Militants have vowed revenge.

The Islamic State group's spokesman has also urged sympathizers to kill Americans and those from other countries that are carrying out airstrikes against the group.

Attacks by al-Qaida militants from 2003 to 2007 were aimed at destabilizing and toppling the Western-allied monarchy. Among the most stunning attacks were deadly bombings of residential compounds in Riyadh where foreigners lived in 2003.

Saudi officials responded at the time with a massive crackdown that saw many al-Qaida operatives killed or arrested. Others fled to neighboring Yemen, giving birth to one of the group's most active branches.

A group of al Qaeda-linked men suspected of carrying out the 2007 attack on a group of French nationals have been on trial in Riyadh and are currently awaiting a verdict.
