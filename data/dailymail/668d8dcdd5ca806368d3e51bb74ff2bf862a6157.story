Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal has received a major boost ahead of his side's next match against Hull as Ander Herrera and Jonny Evans both came through a reserves match unscathed.

The first team duo stepped up their return to full fitness after spending time on the sidelines due to injury.

Evans has not featured for Manchester United's senior side since he was forced off with an ankle injury int he 5-3 defeat at Leicester in September.

Herrera, on the other hand, has struggled to establish his place in United's starting line-up since sustaining a rib injury against West Ham.

United centre back Evans was withdrawn in the 64th minute, while both Adnan Januzaj and Herrera played the full 90 minutes. 

Januzaj  started the match against Blackburn's reserves at Leigh Sports Village after sitting out his side's 2-1 win over Arsenal at the weekend.

The Belgium international will be hoping to return to action against Hull after remaining on the substitutes' bench throughout the Premier League encounter at the Emirates Stadium.

Red Devils summer signing Herrera managed to get himself on the scoresheet along with reserve team starlets Will Keane, Andreas Pereira and Joe Rothwell.

Keane opened the scoring from close range before Herrera had the simple task of smashing the ball into the net after latching on to a free-kick by Januzaj. 

Luke Shaw (ankle), Daley Blind (knee), Marcos Rojo (shoulder), Rafael (groin), Radamel Falcao (ankle), Jesse Lingard (knee)

Pereira grabbed a third when Blackburn's goalkeeper failed to get a solid hand on to his 20-yard effort before Rothwell hit a double.

Rothwell's second was particularly impressive as he completed a fine team move by curling the ball into the net. 

Van Gaal has had 40 injuries to comprehend with this season with Luke Shaw becoming the latest player to suffer a knock.
