Niall Hall former aide to the Queen Mother, had his car stolen and was kidnapped in South London

A former aide to the Queen Mother today told how he feared he would die when he was kidnapped by a hooded gang who battered him, tied him up and held a knife to his face.

Niall Hall, 49, told a court of the terrifying ordeal that saw his head and face slammed against the pavement during a violent struggle before he was bundled into the back of his own car and taken to a lock up near his home in Battersea, south west London.

Kingston Crown Court heard how Mr Hall was 'targeted' by the gang of thugs who thought he looked like a 'rich man' and stole his £1,000 Tag Heuer watch and forced him to hand over his bank card PIN numbers on February 1. 

During the hour long assault, Mr Hall had two knives held to to his stomach and face, had his hands tied up with an iPod cable from his Land Rover and was made to strip naked and change clothes as the kidnappers tried to cover their tracks.

Martin Dias, 29, Aaron Miller, 21, Derwin Ellis, 30, and Brian Gilbert, 19, are accused of carrying out the vicious assault, which saw them steal the watch, cufflinks and withdraw £470 from Mr Hall's bank account. 

Giving evidence today, smartly dressed Mr Hall, said he was 'very, very afraid' as he was ambushed by three of the men outside his Battersea home in south west London as he parked his Land Rover Freelander. 

The former Army captain tried to flee his captors as they ordered him in to his car and put his coat over his heard, only to be tackled to the ground by the largest of the three, smashing his head.

He said: 'I suddenly became aware of three people around me. They were all men and were large, Afro Caribbean men.

'They were right upon me and they were moving at speed towards me. 

'I really didn't have time to do anything. I started to move because I was fairly certain I was about to be assaulted.

'I was grabbed, I was seized and I was pushed to the ground. I was laying on my back with my arms and legs in the air, I suppose not unlike a dead insect. I was asked to hand over my watch and wallet.'

Terrified Mr Hall told how he immediately obeyed, but tried to flee once again when he was ordered to get in the car.

The Queen Mother with Niall Hall on the right who was an aide in the 1980s. He was 'carjacked' and stripped naked at knifepoint by three robbers

He said: 'I got a couple of feet at most, I felt as if the soles of my shoes had turned into iceskates. I was knocked to the ground in a violent manner.  'My head and face hit the road and my left eye went black.

'It was bruised and filled with blood. I couldn't see out if it.

'I saw a knife being held to my face by the person who had tackled me to the ground.  'It was a short blade, about five to six inches long, and probably about an inch and a half in width. It was an old steel mottled sort of blade. 

'It was made pretty clear I was to comply with what I was told. Two people dragged me to to the car. I was dragged along by my knees. It was quite painful by this stage.

'I had a bleeding eye, cut legs - I was then bundled in to the back of the car. I was put in the rear passenger side. 

'I was being held down on the back seat, across two of the people. I had a knife held to my throat and a knife held towards my stomach. 

'It was along the lines of 'keep quiet, do what we say unless you want to be stabbed'. 

'I could feel the cold steel upon my neck. I felt very very afraid.'

The violent robbers then drove him to the nearby lockup on the Surry Lane estate, Battersea, south west London.  'I had time to reflect on what was happening. I really though that I was going to die,' he said. 

Mr Hall was then ordered out his car and 'frogmarched' to the lock up, where he was tied up and forced to reveal his bank details. 

He said: 'They removed everything, card by card. They said 'you must be a very rich man'.' After handing over his PIN numbers, two of the men left to get the cash and clean up the car, while one stayed to guard Mr Hall. 

Mr Hall added he heard someone saying 'I want to f**king kill you, I want to f**king kill you' and believed it to be his captor, until realising it was actually a ring tone. 

When the men returned, having withdrawn £470 from Mr Hall's bank account at a Tesco's ATM, he was stripped naked and forced to change as the gang tried to hide the evidence. 

He was then driven to Chelsea, just across the river, and dumped on Cheyne Walk, where he was told to stare at a wall for ten minutes.  But he managed to flag down cyclists for help and was taken to hospital.

Mr Hall told Kingston Crown Court (pictured) he feared for his life during the hour-long ordeal in February this year

He suffered a fractured left eye socket, damage to his eye, acute bleeding to the left side of his brain, a chipped tooth, cuts, swelling and bruising.

Police recovered CCTV images showing another member of the gang, Kizzy Miller, 32, driving to cash points to take money out of Mr Hall's account, jurors heard. 

Detectives also found the lock-up splattered in blood where the victim's clothes had been dumped.

Dias, Ellis and Gilbert deny kidnap and robbery. Kizzy Miller denies a charge of encouraging or assisting the offences. Aaron Miller has pleaded guilty to kidnap and robbery.

Mr Hall acted as an aide to the Queen Mother in the 1980s when his duties included collecting the armfuls of bouquets and cards delivered to her London home, Clarence House, on her birthday and organising her annual St Patrick's Day photocall with the Irish Guards. 

The case continues.
