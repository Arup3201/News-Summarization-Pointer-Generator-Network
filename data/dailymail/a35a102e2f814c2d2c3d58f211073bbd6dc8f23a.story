A Twitter troll who sent vile messages to a feminist campaigner on Twitter posted a selfie of herself enjoying a sightseeing trip to Buckingham Palace just hours before appearing before Westminster Magistrates' Court.

Isabella Sorley, 23, posted the picture of herself on to the site along with the message 'Just chilling at the queens' (sic) yesterday morning. She is believed to have travelled to London from Newcastle so she could appear before the court in Westminster.

The picture, posted alongside a link to The Clash song 'London Calling', will raise questions about whether Sorley took her trip to London for a court appearance seriously.

Earlier this month, she also posted tweets saying that 2014 was 'the year of Isabella Sorley'.

Sorley, from Newcastle upon Tyne, and John Nimmo, 25, from South Shields, yesterday pleaded guilty to sending 'menacing' messages to campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez when they appeared at court.

The court heard how Sorley told Criado-Perez to 'f*** off and die', 'go kill yourself' and 'rape is the last of your worries'.

Nimmo told Ms Criado-Perez to 'shut up b****' and 'Ya not that gd looking to rape u be fine' followed by 'I will find you (smiley face)' and then the message 'rape her nice a**'.

Nimmo also targeted Stella Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, with the message 'The things I cud do to u (smiley face)', calling her 'Dumb blond b****.'

Outside the court yesterday, Sorley blamed her Twitter tirade on jumping back on 'the bandwagon'.

She told a reporter from The Newstatesman: 'I'd personally say the reason why I got into all this s**** is because I jumped on the bandwagon, so to speak. That isn't an excuse . . . I didn't even know who [Caroline] was until I was arrested and told by the police what she was about.

'Of course, I support woman's rights, being one myself. I'm ashamed of my behaviour and like I've previously stated I won't be doing anything like this again.'

She said she made the comments to 'help people in the future to not make the same mistake that I have, [if] that only be just one person, then it will be worth it'

The threats started in July last year after the Bank of England revealed Jane Austen would replace Charles Darwin as the face of the £10 note following a campaign spearheaded by Ms Criado-Perez.

Sorley last month tweeted messages about how words 'are never a threat' and that 'Hard skin is something you have to develop in Britain'.

One of the messages posted on December 10 reads: 'Bit pathetic really that you've wasted all of the time/money because you were scared by a couple of words'.

On December 16 the Crown Prosecution Service revealed Sorley and Nimmo were to be charged with improper use of a communications network for their role in the 'avalanche' of abuse directed towards Ms Criado-Perez.

Sorley has a degree in creative advertising from Leeds College of Art and is currently said to be working in an Asda supermarket in Newcastle.

But she deluged Miss Criado-Perez with menacing messages claiming that she had just been released from prison, writing: ‘I will find you and you don’t want to know what I will do when I do, you’re pathetic, kill yourself before I do.’

Other vile messages included: ‘I’ve only just got out of prison and would happily do more time to see you berried!!’ (sic) and ‘Rape?! I’d do a lot worse things than rape you!!’

Troll: Sorley attempted to justify her actions on Twitter shortly after being asked to stop making threats

Rant: Sorley continued her Twitter rant despite police intervention

Sorley was arrested in October 2013 at her home in Newcastle and admitted to police that she had sent some of the tweets, suggesting she had been 'off my face on drink' at the time, the court heard.

Nimmo was released on conditional bail, with Sorley, whose previous convictions include being drunk and disorderly on 21 occasions, remanded in custody.

The pair are due to be sentenced on January 24 at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Sorley was warned by District Judge Howard Riddle it was 'almost inevitable' she would receive a jail sentence.

He warned Nimmo, described to the court as a 'social recluse' who 'rarely leaves his house', that 'all options' as to sentencing remained open.

Following the court hearing yesterday, Ms Criado-Perez thanked people for their support but warned that Sorley and Nimmo represented a 'small drop in the ocean' to the amount of abuse she received in July and August.

She tweeted a statement saying: 'I am hugely relieved that these two defendants have pleaded guilty, meaning that there is no need for a trial and for the whole process to drag on longer - it has already dragged on for almost six months, with all the attendant anxiety you'd expect.

'This is not a joyful day; these two abusers reflect a small drop in the ocean, both in terms of the amount of abuse I received across July and August, but also in terms of the abuse that other women receive online - women who have little to no recourse to justice.

'However, I hope that for some people who are watching, this conviction will be a warning: online abuse is not consequence-free. I hope that some people watching will think twice before abusing someone else. There is not much else I can say given there are other cases still on-going.'
