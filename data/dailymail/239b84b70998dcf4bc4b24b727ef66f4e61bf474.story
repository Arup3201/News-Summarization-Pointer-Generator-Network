Massimiliano Alegri has warned his players to brace themselves for an important week as Juventus look to continue their push towards the Serie title and bid to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League.

The Italian champions take on 11th-place Palermo on Saturday as they chase down their fourth consecutive Scudetto before travelling to Germany to to defend a 2-1 lead over Brussia Dortmund on Wednesday.

Juve currently hold an 11-point lead over nearest rivals Roma but Allegri insists there is still work to do to secure the title as the club head into what the coach describes as a decisive week.

'We begin a week that's more or less decisive as far as the league's concerned, which still hasn't been won, and the Champions League, where we've got a knockout game,' he said.

'But for now we'll just stay focused on Palermo.

'I think we'll have a difficult game because they're in a healthy position in the table and can play quite a carefree game.

'There will also be a full stadium and playing Juventus will provide a huge boost for them, I think.

'Crucially, they have shown themselves to be strong at home, they've taken 26 points at home, so it will not be an easy game.'

Juventus have been heavily linked with Palermo's impressive 21-year-old striker Paulo Dybala, who has netted 12 Serie A goals this season, but Allegri was giving nothing away when asked about the Argentinian.

'I think Dybala can get even better and eventually play for a great team,' Allegri said.

Former AC Milan coach Allegri added that his side will have to be at their very best to reach the last eight of the Champions League but insisted the ambition is to turn Juventus into one of the best teams in Europe.

'On Wednesday we will have to be very good.

'Can Juve get into the top five in Europe in the future? It must be the goal and ambition.'
