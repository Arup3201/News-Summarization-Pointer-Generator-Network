An alliance of European countries is rebelling against EU plans to make Britain open its doors to thousands of ‘benefit tourists’.

Ministers have joined forces with 12 other nations – including France, Germany and Denmark – angry at the European Commission’s threat to take the UK to court over rules which limit foreigners’ ability to claim benefits.

If the Commission gets its way, Britain could be hit with an extra £2.5billion in welfare payments, making it even harder to tackle our huge deficit.

Present rules: Currently, the UK says EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain  Duncan Smith warned that the move  was just the latest example of ‘unelectable and unaccountable’ European  institutions’ desire to grab power from national parliaments.

The row comes as Tories gather for  their annual conference in Manchester amid a growing clamour from Eurosceptic backbenchers to use the eurozone  crisis as a lever to get Brussels powers returned to Britain.

Last night former Cabinet minister John Redwood said the issue showed why Foreign Secretary William Hague should enter into negotiations with EU leaders to get powers handed back to Britain. He wrote on his blog: ‘What is he doing about it? Why won’t he get on with renegotiating the UK position?

‘Most UK electors want a trade agreement but do not want to be bossed around by a high spending legislature poking its nose into our domestic affairs.’

Diktat: The European Commission in Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the 'human rights' of EU citizens

Concerns: It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here

At present the UK says that EU immigrants must have worked here previously, or have a decent chance of getting a job, before they can claim benefits.

But on Thursday Brussels gave the UK two months to scrap the rules, saying they infringe the ‘human rights’ of EU citizens.

It is feared the change could open the door to tens of thousands of Eastern Europeans who are currently deterred from coming here.

Benefits are much more generous in the West than among the former Soviet-dominated countries of the East.

'Out of order': Iain Duncan Smith said Europe was encroaching on social security

For example, a person who has been 
unemployed for more than three months in Poland gets a dole of just £110
a month. This is less than half the £270 or so he would get if he moved
to the UK.

So far only Britain has been threatened with court action, but yesterday an EU official warned that other countries could be next if their residence rules are deemed too strict.

Chris Grayling, the Employment Minister, revealed growing anger among European governments and said he would be bringing up the issue at a meeting of ministers in Brussels in three weeks’ time.

His alliance is made up of prosperous Western European countries which are also worried about an influx from former Communist states if they are forced to change their rules.

They, too, face huge costs if they have to tighten up their rules. France, for example, will currently not pay out benefits unless migrants have worked in the country for at least four months.

Mr Grayling told the BBC: ‘There is a very definite difference of opinion between us and the Commission over this. I don’t think somebody coming from another EU state should be able to access benefit simply by turning up here and saying, “I am going to live in the UK from now on”.

‘The truth is European law is all over the place at the moment. We had a case three months ago in which we were instructed by the European Court to make disability payments to a British citizen, a young woman living in Spain.

'This kind of land grab has the potential to cause mayhem... we will fight it'

‘We can’t be responsible both for benefits to be paid to our citizens overseas and to citizens of other countries in the UK. What we have ended up with is a mess and it is not a mess that simply faces the UK – it is one that affects several other states.’

Mr Duncan Smith told the Daily Mail: ‘This is out of order. Social security was always considered to be a national responsibility, but now Europe is encroaching on these areas.

‘This kind of land grab from the EU has the potential to cause mayhem to nation states, and we will fight it.’

It emerged yesterday that Nick Clegg told EC president Jose Manuel Barroso on Thursday that Britain would fight any attempt to force us to pay benefits to workless EU migrants.

The Lib Dems’ support for the Government on this issue is in contrast to their refusal to join the Tories in opposing the extension of employment rights to agency workers.

A source close to Mr Clegg said: ‘Nick thinks this is a really bad idea. It is one thing to look after European citizens who have worked over here and paid taxes, but it is quite another to start writing cheques to anyone and everyone who turns up.’

A spokesman for the European Commission said the UK was being targeted first because complaints had been received about the rule here.

But she warned that other countries would be next.She said: ‘We have issues with other countries but the UK case is much more advanced.’
