Found: The body of missing teacher Terrilyn Monette was found in her car at the bottom of Bayou St. John

The body of missing New Orleans school teacher Terrilyn
Monette was found in her car at the bottom of a bayou about midday today.

The 26-year-old disappeared on March 2 after hanging out with friends at a Lakeview bar and driving off alone in the early hours.

Representative Austin Badon said Monette's black Honda was pulled from Bayou St. John near Harrison Avenue and Wisner Boulevard in the St. Bernard area.

The car's Louisiana license plate number - WUN494 - matched the registration of Monette's missing three-door vehicle.

While Badon said he was '100 percent sure' the body inside the car was Monette, an official autopsy coroner was needed.

WWLTV.com reports the
body and car was found by a diver using sonar equipment.

Members of Monette's devastated family, including her mother Toni Enclade who was in town for a recent vigil, were emotional and clung to each other as the car was removed.

'I don't understand why it took them so long to find
her car,' a distressed Enclade told nola.com.

'This is supposedly one of the
first places they would have checked.

'I'm just overwhelmed. It doesn't make
sense.'

New Orleans police had pulled about 17 cars from nearby water bodies in the extensive search for Monette, and also reviewed hundreds of hours of surveillance footage.

Monette's family also had been flying back and forth from her
native California to continue to look for her. 

The grieving family today had a moment of silence on the Harrison Avenue Bridge to honor the second-grade teacher, according to Fox8.

Badon, who has championed the search, said he was heartbroken.

'It's a really sad moment,' he told nola.com.

'I've gotten
to know the family extremely well. I'm heartbroken for them.

'There's some sense
of closure for them and I'm glad, though it wasn't the outcome I had hoped
for.'

Police continue to investigate the incident.
