A bolt of lightning blasted the steeple of an Alabama baptist church clean off as it started a fire which caused huge damage at the building, it has been reported.

The spire at the church is thought to 
have been struck at about 10pm on Monday, causing it to fall off and 
land in the car park below, witnesses have said.

The Unity Baptist Church, in Tuscaloosa, was badly damaged in the fire which is thought to have been started by the lightning strike.

The witnesses told Fox 6 WBRC they only realised the church was on fire once the spire had fallen.

Firefighters were called to the scene at about 11pm, sheriff's Lieutenant Andy Norris told Alabama Local.

He said nobody had been in the building at the time and there had been no injuries reported.

Church members have described the incident as 'heart breaking', but insisted they would recover.

Jane Howard described the incident as similar to losing 'a child, or a parent'.

She told Fox 6 WBRC: 'I mean this is really awful, and its heart breaking to all of us. But we'll overcome it.'

According to The Republic, Pastor Gene Dockery said a new carpet had been installed and members had painted and refurnished the pews before the fire destroyed the church.

Tuscaloosa Fire and Rescue has said a full investigation was underway into the cause of the fire, but it is believed to have been started by lightning.

Lightning is also thought to be responsible for a fire at the First Church of Nazarene, in Jasper, which caught fire during a storm on Friday.
