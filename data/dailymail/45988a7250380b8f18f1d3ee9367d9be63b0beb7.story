Six workers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles have been fired after allegedly accessing Kim Kardashian's medical records.

The reality star, who gave birth to her first child with partner Kanye West June 15, is tangled in an ongoing internal investigation surrounding the breach, according to TMZ.

Hospital officials confirmed in a statement to MailOnline the lapse occurred during Kardashian's nearly week-long stay at the facility for the birth of baby North West, whose arrival seized headlines around the globe.

Security drama: Kim Kardashian has found herself in the middle of a privacy breach after six workers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where she gave birth to her daughter last month, were fired

The Los Angeles Times first reported the story.

Cedars-Sinai spokesperson Sandy Van told MailOnline between June 18 and 24 five user accounts were involved in 'inappropriate accesses' of patient records. A sixth user accessed that patient's record and as many as 13 others.

Van would not acknowledge if Kardashian was a target.

'In four of the six user accounts, the inappropriate accesses were by employees of private offices of community physicians with medical staff privileges at Cedars-Sinai,' Van wrote in an e-mailed statement.

'Community physicians with medical staff privileges are given a user ID and password to enable them to access the electronic medical record system only for purposes directly related to their care of patients. Any other access is expressly prohibited by Cedars-Sinai policy.'

Staff fired: 'Unauthorized access to any patient's record is, quite simply, unacceptable,' read an official statement from the hospital

Four of the accounts belonged to employees of community physicians with medical staff privileges.

The
remaining two user accounts belonged to an unpaid student research 
assistant and to a medical assistant employed by the Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Care Foundation in an outpatient office of the Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Group, Van stated.

Executives at the facility notified the California Department of Public Health, and informed the affected patients.

The Kardashian family has yet to issue comment on whether they were contacted.

Violations for accessing patient's records without their permission can result in fines of up to $50,000 and possible criminal charges, according to the American Medical Association.

Van said there was no indication to date from the investigation that any criminal acts were committed by the individuals involved in the privacy breaches, although the appropriate law enforcement agencies would be notified 'out of an abundance of caution'.

TMZ previously reported on the unprecedented privacy Kim Kardashian has sought in the wake of her daughter's birth.

The website alleged the 
reality star went to extreme lengths to test her friends' loyalty, 
sending out fake pictures of baby North to see who would attempt to sell
them to the press. Several fake photos of the newborn were reportedly 
offered to various celebrity news outlets.

It remains unclear if Kardashian and West have struck a deal to release the first photos of North.

Meanwhile, Kim's sister Khloé is feeling the brunt of the paparazzi's presence due to her sibling's absence from the spotlight.

In a video posted on Keek, the 29-year-old reveals that her sister's usual entourage of unwanted photographers have turned their attention to her while Kim is holed up at home with her newborn.

'So I guess this is what happens when your sister has a baby and goes into 
hiding: all the paps that follow her decide to sit outside my 
house and follow me,' she bemoans.
