A 20-year-old man was arrested at John Wayne Airport in Irvine, California after he tried to board a Delta Airlines flight to Turkey with a fake passport so he could allegedly go to Syria to join the terrorist group ISIS, reports federal court documents.

On July 2,Â  Adam Dandach, who also goes by the name Fadi Fadi Dandach, was stopped by FBI's Orange County Joint Terrorism Task Force just as he was about to board a plane to Istambul to allegedly pledge his allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or Isis, rebels, reports NBC.

Adam Dandach is scheduled to be arraigned in a federal Santa Ana, California court on Monday.

ISIS is an al-Qaida group overseeing Sunni militants in Iraq.

'What this man in Orange County was attempting to do is probably one the paramount security threats to the country,' said Adam Schiff, a member of the House Intelligence Committee.

'Americans and Europeans going to Syria, joining the fight, becoming radicalized, learning how to build bombs. And then coming back to try and attack targets here at home,' he continued.

Federal court papers state that Dandach told law enforcement that, 'he was traveling to Syria for the purpose of pledging his alliance to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, a known terrorist organization, that he would assist ISIS with anything that ISIS asked him to do, and that he believed the killings of U.S. soldiers are justified killings.'

Dandach applied for a passport in June and told officials he accidentally threw his passport in the trash while he was cleaning.

Authorities say that Dandach's mother allegedly hid his original passport in a closet so that he wouldn't fly to the middle east back in December.

O.C. Weekly, who originally reported the story, explains that it's a felony to falsify a passport application and to obtain one by lying.
