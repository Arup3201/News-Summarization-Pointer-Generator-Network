A cavalryman survivor of the Hyde Park nail bombing killed his two young children and then himself after his wife demanded a divorce, an inquest heard.

Michael Pedersen, 51, saw four fellow soldiers and seven horses from the Blues and Royals killed in the infamous IRA terrorist attack in 1982. His horse at the time, Sefton, became a household name at the time because of its amazing recovery.

But after struggling to cope with the the end of his 10-year marriage to wife Erica, Mr Pedersen killed their two children, Ben, seven, and Freya, six, and then killed himself.

Mr Pedersen, had been described as ‘controlling’ and suspicious of his wife, who he had previously accused of having an affair, the inquest heard.

He had recently complained to his doctor that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after his 21-year army career.

The couple’s marriage had collapsed after an argument at a party where Mrs Pedersen claimed her husband had assaulted her.

Mr Pedersen was arrested and served an injunction banning him from visiting the family home in Ashford, Middlesex.

Giving evidence, Mrs Pedersen said she had suffered a broken arm and shoulder after her husband pushed her and she had fallen at the military reunion on August 25.

‘He decided to tell me I was an unfit mother. He shoved me in the back and I went flying,’ she told the inquest at Winchester.

Mrs Pedersen, a 43-year-old driving instructor, said that by the summer their marriage was ‘not good at all’ and had started divorce proceedings at the time of the deaths.

She said: ‘There was constant shouting, accusing me of things. He was constantly shouting but there were quite a few quite nasty outbursts,’ she added.

Mr Pedersen, a lorry driver, was given a caution by police in 2004 for assaulting a man he suspected of having an affair with his wife, the inquest was told.

Mrs Pedersen told the hearing that before Mr Pedersen left he ransacked the family home and took her chef’s knife - which was later used in the brutal killings.

On the day of the deaths Mr Pedersen had taken the children on a pre-arranged visit to see his father Brian and the family enjoyed a trip to a lake before lunch together.

Brian Pedersen said that his son had been affected by the breakdown of his marriage more than his experiences with the Army.

‘I think the thing that hurt him more than anything else was when he was told to leave his house and children and to leave Erica, who he loved in his own way.

‘I don’t think he could bear to live without all those things and for anyone to say that it was what happened in the Army that affected his judgement - that’s wrong.‘ he said.

In a Facebook message a few weeks before the tragedy, Mr Pedersen wrote that he had experienced the 'worst day of my life' after splitting from his wife

Later that day Mr Pedersen took the children to a remote country lane in Hampshire where he parked the car and brutally attacked them.

The bodies were found by a dog walker, who saw Mr Pedersen’s Saab Convertible and then noticed a child’s leg at Newton Stacey, near Andover, on September 30.

Ben was found with six stab wounds and a kitchen knife sticking ‘bolt upright’ in his chest.

His younger sister, dressed in a pink top and patterned pink leggings, had been attacked with a larger knife, which her father then turned on himself.

Both children died from stab wounds to the chest and suffered defensive wounds to their arms and hands.

Mr Pedersen had stabbed himself in the chest, piercing his heart. No traces of alcohol, anti-depressants or other drugs were found in his system.

A number of letters addressed to various people, including Mrs Pedersen and the police were discovered inside the vehicle.

Mr Pedersen’s younger brother Robert told the inquest that he had been upset with his wife.

But he was also ‘angry’ with police whom he felt had not listened to him after he was questioned on suspicion of assault.

Speaking of Ben and Freya, Robert added: ‘He worshipped the ground they walked on’.

Several witnesses described Mr 
Pedersen, who had two children from a previous marriage, as controlling and sometimes overbearing and a bully.

Central Hampshire Coroner Grahame Short recorded that Freya and Ben had been unlawfully killed by their father.

He ruled that Pedersen, who had recently moved to Chertsey, Surrey, committed suicide.

‘It seems to me this was a 
pre-conceived decision because of the location chosen. It was on a 
remote spot in the country where you might assume you were unlikely to 
be seen or discovered,’ he said.

‘What happened is beyond 
comprehension. It must have been terrifying for Ben and Freya in 
particular to have realised what their father intended and then to be 
attacked in the way they clearly were.’
