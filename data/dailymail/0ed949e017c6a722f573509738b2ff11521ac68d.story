The mother of a 20-month-ld girl who went missing from a house in Waterville, Maine, says she blames the toddler's father for her disappearance.

Trista Reyonolds says Justin DiPietro should have protected little Ayla Reyonolds. Mr DiPietro told police his daughter disappeared after he put her to bed in her crib last Friday night

Teams of investigators are stepping up their focus on the house where Ayla went missing seven days ago as they used cadaver dogs to search local fields, streams and waterways.

Police are following up more than 200 tips from the public on Ayla - while police, firefighters, game wardens, marine patrol officers and civilian volunteers have joined the search effort.

Toddler: Ayla Reynolds, of Waterville, Maine, was reported missing from her bed on Saturday morning by her father Justin DiPietro, who told police he last saw her when he put her to bed the previous night

'I trusted him to keep her safe,' Miss Reynolds told the Today Show.

'And now she is missing and I don't know where she is. I blame him right now. He did not protect her the way he was supposed to.'

Ayla was living with Mr DiPietro after state social services removed her from Miss Reynolds care because of substance abuse problems, the Today Show reported.

Miss Reynolds told the program she is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for three months.

She said she filed court documents seeking sole custody of her daughter the day before she went missing.

Removed: Trista, a recovering alcoholic, said state officials removed Ayla from her care while she went into rehabilitation

Investigators put up crime-scene tape around Ayla's house, called two of the state's top homicide prosecutors to the site on Thursday and brought a state police support van to the scene.

‘That is the last place Ayla was seen,’ Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said. ‘So as you might expect, we're going to give a lot of attention to that particular house.

‘(We’re) looking for any clues where she might be or where it would help us to locate her. We need to go through that as thoroughly as we can, just like we do in any other investigation.’

Chief Massey insisted that although the toddler's disappearance remains a missing child case, ‘everything remains open and we're not discounting anything.’

He said officials from the state attorney general's office, including criminal division chief William Stokes, were at the house, but that was just to give them an opportunity to look at the site.

‘We're at a point where we thought it was appropriate for him to come in and just do a walk-through,’ Chief Massey said. ‘We're just at a different point in the investigation.’

An attorney general spokesman said the visit to Ayla's father's home by Chief Stokes and Andrew Benson, another top homicide prosecutor, was ‘standard protocol’.

The police chief played down the significance of yellow tape strung about the perimeter of the small property, saying it was ‘just an additional barrier’ to secure the site.

He said people should not read too much 
into the presence of a state police incident command van parked there, 
saying it was for the convenience of technicians working at the site.

The investigation continued in other parts of the central Maine city, including at the airport where cadaver dogs were brought in, as well as streams and waterways.

Mr DiPietro told police he last saw Ayla
when he put her to bed last Friday night. He said she was wearing green
pyjamas with polka dots and the words ‘Daddy's Princess’ on them.

'There are a lot of things that we've eliminated, and that's just as important as identifying things'

Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey

'I have no idea what happened to Ayla, or
who is responsible,' he said. 'I will not make accusations or 
insinuations towards anyone until the police have been able to prove 
who's responsible for this.'

She also had a soft cast on her broken left arm. Ayla ended up with her father after child welfare workers intervened while her mother, Trista Reynolds, checked into a 10-day rehab programme.

The case drew expressions of community support and hope the child will be found safe as more than 60 people, many of them mothers, gathered at a local church on Wednesday for a candlelight vigil.

Chief Massey said police have made ‘significant progress’ although Ayla has not been found. ‘There are a lot of things that we've eliminated, and that's just as important as identifying things,’ he said.
