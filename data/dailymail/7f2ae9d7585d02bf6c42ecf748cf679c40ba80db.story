There's a saying that a penny saved is a penny earned. 

That was certainly true for one Texas man who saved all of his pennies over a staggering 65 years and had a collection of 81,600 pennies worth $816.

Ira Keys, 81, had been saving his pennies for nearly seven decades and finally decided to cash them in at a bank in Slaton, Texas.

Thrifty: Ira Keys, 81, had saved his pennies for nearly seven decades and finally decided to cash them in 

Heavy: His collection weighed in at around 500 pounds and nearly 'broke the springs' on his pick-up truck

Count: Bank staff carefully counted every single penny and said it was unlike anything they'd seen before

Keys said his penny-saving obsession begun after his father encouraged him to save his money when he was a young man and some were saved when he was just 17-years-old. 

He told KCBD-TV: '[My dad] says, 'Whatever you do son, save your money.'

Keys said: 'Back when I started in '52, I didn't have a lot of money, so I saved pennies and I just kept saving them.' 

His collection weighed a whopping 500 pounds and Keys joked that he nearly 'broke the springs on his pickup truck' while he hauled them into the bank.

Bank staff at Prosperity Bank took more than an hour to count the pennies which were piled high in coffee containers.

Kari Lewis, a personal banker at Prosperity Bank, told KCBD that Keys' collection of pennies was unlike anything she has ever seen before.

'You see them on the ground and you're kind of like, 'Oh, I'm not picking that up,' but for him to collect it for years and years was pretty amazing,' she said.  

Keys admits that he still has a ton of pennies left at home which he kept and did not cash in and he already has a plan for what he's going to do with them

She added: 'We ended up with $816 in pennies. Not a typical day at the bank, at all.' 

However Keys admits that he still has a ton of pennies at home which he  did not cash in and already has a plan for what he's going to do with them.

'I'm going to build a room divider and have pennies all in it,' he said, 'the shiny ones.'

But the 81-year-old is still holding on to his father's valuable lesson about saving. He says he will keep his piggy bank full.

'It's just a habit I've got into, and habits are hard to break sometimes,' Keys said, 'but I don't think I'll have this many when I cash them in again.'

He also believes that his father would have been annoyed that he'd cashed in his stash.

He joked: 'He'd say, I told you to save...not to cash them in.'
