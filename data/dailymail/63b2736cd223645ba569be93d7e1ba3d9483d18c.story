Kristy Richardson, 38, told staff three times that she needed a gluten-free tagliatelle but was unknowingly served regular pasta and suffered a 'nasty reaction', a court heard

Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver's restaurant chain has been fined after staff served the wrong kind of pasta to a woman with a severe food allergy.

Mother Kristy Richardson, 38, who has coeliac disease, which means she is unable to digest gluten, suffered a 'nasty reaction' after being served regular pasta.

She was violently sick for around five hours after the meal in Portsmouth, Hants, which she had been enjoying with her husband on their wedding anniversary.

A court heard how she told staff three times she needed a gluten-free tagliatelle but in a terrible 'misunderstanding', she was unknowingly served regular pasta.

Mrs Richardson also suffers from an illness that means she needs a heart and lung transplant.

The sickness meant she was temporarily removed from the register.

A judge today fined the famous eaterie £8,000 for breaching food safety laws and ordered it to pay £9,212 costs. The chain serves an estimated five million diners a year.

Prosecutor
 Malcolm Gibney, for Portsmouth City Council Trading Standards, said: 
'Mrs Richardson and her husband attended for lunch for their wedding 
anniversary with the intention of having an enjoyable meal.

'Mrs Richardson was diagnosed as a coeliac sufferer at the age of 19 and is very conscious of her diet.

'She
 wanted to check that the restaurant could serve a gluten free meal and 
she suffers from a number of other illnesses so wanted to ensure the 
staff knew what her needs were.

'She spoke to the maitre d' and was assured that gluten free pasta could be provided, so an order was placed and consumed.

'But within a couple of hours Mrs Richardson started to feel nauseous and continued to vomit over the next four or five hours.

'As a result she suffered a very nasty reaction and an auto-immune response to other medication she had.'

A telephone call to the restaurant revealed that she had been served wheat pasta, despite telling three staff members she must have a gluten-free dish.

Environmental health experts swooped on the premises and an investigation was launched, revealing 'lamentable failures' over food allergy issues.

At first, the company suggested there had been a 'mix up' when Mrs Richardson gave a waitress her order on November 17, 2011.

A legal battle followed, but the firm
 last month pleaded guilty to selling food not of the nature, substance 
or quality demanded by a purchaser. The offence is a breach of the Food Safety Act 1990.

Jamie's
 Italian failed to exercise due diligence and take all appropriate 
precautions that meals were served as requested, it was heard.

New procedures and extra training have now been introduced.
 Harry Vann, mitigating, said Mrs Richardson's waitress thought she 
ordered a vegetarian, rather than gluten-free and vegetarian option.

Mr Vann said: 'Jamie's Italian sincerely apologises that it has fallen short of its food safety obligations.

'It
 takes this extremely seriously. It is a matter of very sincere regret 
to the company that any customer should suffer illness as a result of 
any meal served by us.

'The failure to provide to a customer what was ordered is made out and the company fully and frankly accepts that.'

A
 'specific allergy' button has since been added to the machine waiting 
staff use to place orders, Mr Vann told Fareham Magistrates Court.

This addition meant there is now 'no way' an allergy could be missed by kitchen staff, he added.

District Judge Anthony Calloway said: 'Mrs Richardson's victim impact statement sets out the difficulties that affect her.

'I accept that the root cause of the incident was a misunderstanding between staff. No system could be immune to the misunderstanding which happened in this case and the company is fitting that due diligence.

'Its food safety systems fell short of expectations in this particular case and the company have apologised to Mrs Richardson and taken steps to adjust and tighten their operation.'

He ordered Jamie's Italian Limited to pay an £8,000 fine plus £9,212 costs.

The first Jamie's Italian restaurant, a business venture between Jamie and his old friend Gennaro Contaldo, opened in Oxford in June 2008.

Their goal was to use fresh, locally sourced ingredients and show British diners 'the passionate, humble and sociable attitude of Italians towards food'.

It soon spread across the country, with eateries in London's Canary Wharf, Brighton, Bath, Cardiff, Cambridge, Leeds, Liverpool and Glasgow.

In 2011, the chain opened its first restaurant overseas in Dubai. There are now more than 30 worldwide.

Alan Cufley, head of service for environmental health at Portsmouth City Council, said: "Having a meal out should be an enjoyable experience where you expect to receive the food you ordered.

'This is incredibly important if you have a diet-related condition, as this case highlights.

'Anywhere that sells or prepares food, regardless of size, has to follow food safety legislation and we must take action against those that put customers' health at risk.

'I'm pleased to say Jamie's Italian have accepted their responsibilities in this case and have now improved procedures for special dietary requests.'

Mrs Richardson is on the organ donor register for a double lung transplant, and at the time of the meal was on the heart transplant list, after developing pulmonary hypertension - a potentially life threatening condition - during pregnancy.

A friend, who did not want to be named, said: 'This was only the second time that Kristy had been out with her husband since giving birth.

'It was an awful time for them, with Kristy being told she had a terminal illness and having to look after a baby.

'They wanted to have a quiet meal to celebrate after a tough couple of years and it all went wrong.'Mrs Richardson had given birth to her daughter, Eleanor, in December 2009. Eleanor was 10 weeks premature and was delivered by caesarean.

With Eleanor in childcare, the couple had taken a rare moment to relax with a meal and a cinema visit.

The friend said: 'Kristy had been so ill. She has been a coeliac since her teens so she knew not to eat pasta.

'She asked three times for non-gluten free pasta and they served it her anyway.'

Mrs Richardson refused to speak because of a legal agreement drawn up as part of her out of court settlement with Jamie's Italian.

This figure was not discussed in court but was taken into account by the judge.
