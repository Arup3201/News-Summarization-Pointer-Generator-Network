He may have moved into one of the world's most highly regarded zoos, but Kumbuka, the silverback gorilla, does not seem very impressed by the food.

The 15-year-old was introduced to the world's media after his move from Paignton Zoo, in Devon, to ZSL London Zoo.

And the gorilla did not bother minding his manners as he made faces after being given a green pepper to eat and then picked his nose.

Expressive: Kumbuka does not look too impressed as he is introduced to the world's media

Settling in: Kumbuka munches on a green pepper as he gets used to his new surroundings 

Magnificent: Kumbuka, a critically-endangered gorilla, is London Zoo's newest arrival

Manners: The gorilla ignores photographers busily snapping away at him as he sits and picks his nose

The critically-endangered gorilla has 
arrived at London Zoo and is already impressing females - despite 
the fact he has never had a mate.

Kumbuka, a western lowland gorilla, had not encountered females before arriving at the zoo two weeks ago.

It
is hoped that the 29-stone primate will charm his female playmates 
enough to mate with them, helping to boost numbers of his species in the
European breeding programme.

He has already been spotted flirting with the females, as well as showing off his impressive agility climbing around the Zoo's Gorilla Kingdom.

Daniel Simmonds, gorilla keeper at ZSL London Zoo, said: 'We're all really excited by the arrival of Kumbuka and he's settling in well.

'We've been slowly introducing him to our three females, and Mjukuu and Effie are already quite smitten with their handsome new roommate. 

Breeding: It is hoped Kumbuka will mate with the zoo's three female gorillas

On the prowl: Kumbuka's move to London Zoo is part of the European breeding programme

Enclosure: Kumbuka has already showed off his agility by swinging around the Gorilla Kingdom

Threatened: It is hoped the new silverback will help increase numbers of the critically endangered population

Strength: The 15-year-old weighs more than 29stone and is seven foot tall

'He is proving to have quite a playful 
side to him; he likes to snap the branches on the smaller trees on their
island and standing in the spray of the hosepipe when we clean his 
dens.'

Kumbuka, who stands at seven foot tall, has replaced previous male Kesho who moved to Longleat Safari Park to be reunited with his brother Alf in a bachelor group.

The gorilla will now act as leader of the troop at ZSL London Zoo.

Ladies' gorilla: Two of the three females are already smitten with the new arrival, say zoo keepers

Having fun: Keepers say there is a playful side to the gorilla, who likes to snap branches and stand in the hosepipe spray when they clean out his dens

New arrival: Kumbuka moved from Paignton Zoo in Devon two weeks ago and had never seen a female before
