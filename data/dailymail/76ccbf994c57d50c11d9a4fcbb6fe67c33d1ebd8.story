Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers allayed fears over Fabio Borini after the Sunderland target sustained a shoulder injury that has threatened to scupper his prospects of a move from Anfield.

The Italy striker, who has been the subject of an accepted £14million bid from Sunderland, was hurt in the ninth minute of Liverpool’s 1-0 defeat to Roma at Fenway Park following a collision with Seydou Keita and immediately received treatment on the touchline.

Borini 
tried to continue but, moments later, he gestured to the bench that he 
could no longer continue and was forced to make a slow trudge around the
 pitch accompanied by one of Liverpool’s medical staff, ensuring that he
 did not allow his right arm to leave his side.

Though
 Borini was Brendan Rodgers’ first signing two years ago, his time at 
Anfield has been inauspicious and he spent the last 12 months on loan at
 the Stadium of Light; Rodgers has refused to give him any assurances 
about what might happen next season since he returned.

'It's not as bad as first thought,' said Rodgers, speaking after the game.

'He has only bruised it. He will miss a few days. He won't train for the rest of the trip but it won't be anything serious and he will be okay.

'As for his future, we will see. We have had a significant bid from a Premier League club and it is something he is thinking about.'

Borini will undergo 
further medical tests to ascertain the full extent of the damage and he 
knows from experience how damaging these problems can be as he 
dislocated his left shoulder in February 2013 and spent eight weeks out 
of action. 

Concern: Liverpool's Fabio Borini receives treatment after falling awkwardly against Roma

Earlier on Wednesday, Sunderland boss Poyet said he was determined to bring Borini back to the club.

He told the Sunderland Echo: ‘It is not for me to explain but it is not just a question of Fabio wanting to come or not.

There are many, many things to look at and unfortunately, I cannot comment on those.

‘We are involved in negotiations and you never know how long that can take. There’s nothing new to report as things stand, but we are still hoping to close the deal completely.

‘It’s up to Fabio. We have been clear, everything is fine, there’s no doubt about his connection with our club, and me and him get along fine, so there is no reason for it not to happen.

‘I would love to know how long it will take to sort out, but all I can tell you is that things are changing every day.

‘We have targets that we are looking for, we have other options, but we have an agreement with Liverpool and we will do everything possible to get Fabio to the club first.

‘If Fabio does not come, it does not set us back, we would move on - we are not a one-player team.’
