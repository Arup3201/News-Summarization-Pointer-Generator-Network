Myth: Very few over-65s are moving after retirement, and those that do stay in the same area

Moving to a quiet place in the countryside, by the coast or even abroad, might seem like the perfect retirement.

But for most older people it seems the reality is a lot closer to home.

Despite winding up careers and no longer having young families to look after, millions of over-65s prefer to stay exactly where they are.

Analysis by the Office for National Statistics showed only a tiny number relocate – and most of those who do move house still stay in the same area or close by.

The reluctance of older people to leave their neighbourhood was revealed in a study of 2011 national census figures.

Only 3.6 per cent of over-65s said they had changed their address in the previous year and 57 per cent of those stayed within the same local authority boundaries.

The findings come despite current retirees enjoying the financial benefits of five decades of rising house prices and of gold-plated final salary pensions, which have disappeared for most young people.

Older people who do move are likely to have reasons that include downsizing from a large family home, the need for personal or medical care, or the loss of a spouse or partner, the report said.

Increasingly, a husband or wife may be lost through a marriage break-up rather than death – 8.7 per cent of over-65s are now divorced, compared with 5.2 per cent at the last census in 2001. There are no comparisons from previous censuses to show whether the trend for retirees to stay put is a rising trend, because no comparable question about moving home was asked.

Pensions expert Dr Ros Altmann said: ‘Many [older people] prefer to stay in the family home, which is not just bricks and mortar, but part of the family… the kind of homes many older people would want to live in aren’t there, because we aren’t building them. Many people do not want to live in a flat.’

She said retiring abroad has also become less likely.

‘France and Spain have been highly popular retirement destinations in recent years, but that has been reversed, partly because people may have underestimated some of the problems they can encounter,’ she said. ‘The grass is not always greener, and the beach isn’t always sandier.’

The ONS report said 5.8 per cent of the retirees who relocated in the year before the census had moved from abroad.

It also found that for every 100 women over 65 who relocated, only 72 men did so.

The ONS said this may be due to longer female life expectancy, leading to women downsizing into more manageable accommodation or ‘to access residential care support’.

A new reason for older people staying put may be that they are delaying retirement, with one in ten over-65s in employment or looking for a job, the report said.

The most popular regions among movers were the South East and the South West, with 4.1 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively.
