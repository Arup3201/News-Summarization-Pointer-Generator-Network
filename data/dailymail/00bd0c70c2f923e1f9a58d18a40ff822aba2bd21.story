Do you dream of having a white wedding, but despair at the lack of a man in your life to share the big day with? 

You're not alone - a new trend is cropping up in the Far East for solo weddings. 

As women become financially independent, they are putting off settling down with partners until later on in life. 

But they still want the all-about-me no-expense-spared party that comes with getting hitched, without actually having to tie the knot.

Want to get hitched but don't have a man in your life? A Japanese company is selling 'solo weddings', where girls can experience the thrills of getting married without the need for a husband 

Travel company Cera Travel in Kyoto, a city in southern Japan, has started a new service called 'Solo Wedding.' 

It lets single women enjoy all the fun and glamour of the day, including spending the honeymoon night in a fancy hotel.

The two-day trip sees the clients get dress fittings, choose their own bouquets, get their hair and make-up done and even choose a man to accompany them for a photo shoot.

The service started in June and is aimed at single, working women who have decided to pursue careers instead of follow the traditional Japanese route of getting married. 

The solo wedding arranges for clients to get dress fittings, choose their own bouquets, get their hair and make-up done and even choose a man to accompany them for a photo shoot 

It is also being marketed at women who have been divorced but want to feel special again.

So far ten women have taken up the offer, which costs around £1,700 ($2,750).

A spokesman for the company said: 'It is a truly unique experience and one that we are very proud of.

'All the details are taken care of by wedding professionals and for those who don't want a traditional white wedding dress we offer our Geisha service, which sees the brides going on an historical photo shoot dressed up as Geishas.'

After the big day, the women then head back to a 'honeymoon suite' 

Businesswoman Nagi Daisen, 43, said: 'I've been in a relationship for years but we've never got round to actually getting married.

'So I decided to do this for myself and it was amazing fun.

'I always wanted to wear a wedding dress and to be pampered like this and now I have been. It was great.'

The honeymoon night does not include the model used for the photo shoot, although the company said the women mostly invited their boyfriends to join them in the honeymoon suite after the 'wedding' was over.
