Neo-Nazi thugs were left stunned as an Adolf Hitler impersonator waved and addressed them from a balcony - before taunting the mob and driving away.

The stunt in the town of Brandenburg, near Berlin, happened by chance as an actor filmed a bleak comedy imagining the return of the fascist leader to 21st century Germany.

Even police officers escorting the skin-headed protesters did a double-take when 'Hitler' exited his car, dived inside a nearby building and appeared on a balcony to tell the demonstrators: 'I'm back!'

He then got back into his car and snarled: 'You're all pussies!' before driving off with one last wave.

It prompted hurried calls by police into their walkie-talkies to see if the Hitler lookalike had breached strict postwar rules governing all-things-Nazi. 

He was in fact being played by Oliver Masucci - who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time but decided to hit back at the protest on Saturday.

The actor was filming the movie 'He's Back,' a comedy based on the bestselling book of the same name about a Fuhrer who wakes up from a long sleep to emerge into modern-day Germany.

It is said to be using the same tactics as Sacha Baron Cohen's hit film Borat, which placed his offensive character in real-life situations among unsuspecting members of the public.

'He was making fun of the right wingers,' said a set insider. 'He knew it would plunge them into confusion if they saw their hero on a balcony just like in the days of old'.

Hotel employee Henry Wendrich said the actor looked 'deceptively real'.

Police feared the protesters could have turned violent after the coincidental meeting, but in the end it all passed off peacefully.

'It was unfortunate that the shooting coincided with this rally,' said Dietlind Tiemann, the local mayor.

The protesters were members of the far-right NPD party, which the government has sought to ban several times in recent years because of its anti-immigrant, anti-tolerance agenda.

The party won a seat in the European Parliament earlier this year despite a fresh bid to have the party outlawed for stirring hate in what is generally a liberal country. 

Nazi symbols including the swastika are banned in Germany, and politicians have beefed up laws in recent years to stop neo-Nazi marches near sensitive sites such as Berlin's Holocaust memorial.
