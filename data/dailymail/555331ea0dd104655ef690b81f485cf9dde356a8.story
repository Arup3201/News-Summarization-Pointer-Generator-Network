The Ebola fighters have been named as TIME magazine's Person of the Year 2014. 

As TIME's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, made the announcement on the Today show on Wednesday, she said the men and women who have been battling the worst outbreak of Ebola in history were chosen for their 'exceptionally great amount of courage and kindness and bravery'.

The Ebola Fighters beat the Ferguson protesters to the prestigious title, which honors the 'person' who most influenced the news, for better or for worse throughout the year.

In third place came Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by Masoud Barzani, the acting president of the Iraqi Kurdish Region, and English teacher-turned-Alibaba founder Jack Ma.

Gibbs also revealed five covers featuring different Ebola fighters across West Africa, including doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers.

Announcement: Time's managing editor, Nancy Gibbs, revealed the winner on the Today show on Wednesday

Dr Kent Brantly, an American Ebola survivor who contracted the virus while working with patients in Liberia, features on one of the covers. 

'I think it's fitting that we acknowledge that most Ebola fighters are themselves West Africans,' he told the Today show. 'It's an honor for me to have been considered part of that group.'

The covers also feature Foday Gallah, an ambulance driver who survived the infection, Médecins Sans Frontières nurse Salome Karwah and Dr Jerry Brown, a Liberian surgeon who turned his hospital's chapel into the country's first Ebola treatment center.

In an article for TIME, Gibbs detailed the magazine's reasons for its choice, explaining that this year, 'an outbreak turned into an epidemic' across Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone, before traveling to Europe and the U.S.

'Anyone willing to treat Ebola victims ran the risk of becoming one,' she wrote.

But at a time when there seemed no end to the disease, which has killed 7,000 people in West Africa, a group stepped forward despite the dangers and the incompetencies of their governments.

Second place: Ferguson protesters had been leading the Person of the Year poll at the start of the week

2000: George W. Bush

2001: Rudolph Giuliani, who was New York City's mayor on 9/11

2002: The Enron Whistleblowers

2003: The American soldier

2004: George W. Bush

2005: The Good Samaritans - Bono and Bill Gates

2006: You - represented by the Internet

2007: Vladimir Putin

2008: Barack Obama

2009: Ben Bernanke

2010: Mark Zuckerberg

2011: The Protester

2012: Barack Obama

 'The global health system is nowhere close to strong enough to keep us safe from infectious disease,' Gibbs wrote. 'The rest of the world can sleep at night because a group of men and women are willing to stand and fight.

'For tireless acts of courage and mercy, for buying the world time to boost its defenses, for risking, for persisting, for sacrificing and saving, the Ebola fighters are TIME’s 2014 Person of the Year.'

Each year, the magazine names the 'person' who most influenced the news, for better or for worse.

Last year, the Pope narrowly beat pop star Miley Cyrus to the title for his transformative changes to the tone of the Catholic church on social issues.

In 2012, President Barack Obama took the title and in 2011, the magazine awarded it to 'The Protester', in recognition of their revolutionary role in the Arab Spring that year.

This year, the runner up was the Ferguson Protesters, who 'built a movement that revived a dormant national conversation about race and justice', according to TIME. 

The protesters first took to the streets in August after 18-year-old Michael Brown, an unarmed black man, was shot dead in broad daylight by police officer Darren Wilson.

Witness accounts varied over whether Brown had raised his hands or if there had been a scuffle, but a grand jury ultimately decided not to indict Wilson.

Runners up: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Masoud Barzani, right, the Kurdish politician who has led the Iraqi Kurdistan Region since 2005, were also in TIME's top five

Record breaking: Billionaire Jack Ma's company, Alibaba, became one of the world's most valuable tech companies after raising $25 billion from its IPO in September. He was a TIME runner up 

The officer has since resigned but the grand jury's decision sparked massive, continued protests across the country as demonstrators called for justice and an end to police violence.

The protests became even louder when another unarmed black man, Eric Garner, died after a white officer, Daniel Pantaleo, held him in a chokehold when he was caught selling untaxed cigarettes.

Pantaleo was also not indicted for the July incident, which was caught on video.

More recently, a 12-year-old black child, Tamir Rice, was fatally shot by rookie cop Tim Loehmann in a park in Cleveland, Ohio after the officer mistook his fake gun for a real weapon. A grand jury is now considering that case.

'Protest is a performance that can make the unseen visible,' Alex Altman wrote in TIME. 'In this angry epic, thousands found a role.'

In third place, the magazine named Russian President Vladimir Putin, who invaded Crimea this year and in doing so, restored Russia's honor and saw his approval ratings soar, TIME reported.

He was followed by Masoud Barzani, the acting president of the Iraqi Kurdish Region, and Jack Ma, who founded Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant that debuted a $25 billion IPO this year - making it one of the world's most valuable tech companies.

Shortlisted: Singer-songwriter Taylor Swift (pictured performing last week), who has recently released her fifth studio album, 1989, was among the eight names announced in Monday's shortlist

Center of attention: Roger Goodell (pictured), the National Football League Commissioner, who has recently come under the spotlight for indefinitely suspending footballer Ray Rice, was also on the list

On Monday, Gibbs also appeared on the Today show to reveal the magazine's shortlist of eight names ahead of Wednesday's announcement. 

Taylor Swift, who has recently released her fifth studio album, 1989, was also in the final eight following her monster record sales and her battle with Spotify. She pulled all of her records from the streaming service and argued that it should compensate artists more. 

Apple's CEO Tim Cook was also on the list after not only making headlines for the company's new gadgets - the iPhone 6, Apple Watch and Apple Pay - but also for his personal life, after he became the first openly gay Fortune 500 CEO. 

The beleaguered Roger Goodell, the National Football League commissioner, was also named. His league came under scrutiny over how it dealt with domestic abuse arrests of its players, including Ray Rice.
