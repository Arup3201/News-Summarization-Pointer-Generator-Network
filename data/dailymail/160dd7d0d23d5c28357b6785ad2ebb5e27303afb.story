Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged of a police officer saving the life of a man just before he would have almost certainly been killed by an oncoming train.

A camera captured the moment in Medellin, Colombia, when a man dressed in a white shirt and dark trousers walked towards the edge of a Metro platform, with almost a dozen people watching.

The police officer, who has since reportedly been named as Gustavo Chaparro, grabbed the man just before he stepped off the platform and pulled him onto the ground, before leading him away.
