The Federal Budget for 2014 will see big cuts to Foreign Aid, higher prices at the petrol pump, and tertiary students could be set to pay more as Universities will be able to set their own tuition fees from 2016.

Up to $20 billion is expected be raised for a medical research fund by 2020, but this is thanks to a co-payment of $7 for a visit to the GP - which was previously free on Medicare.

This year could be tough on for families, with family assistance rates on hold for two years, and a freeze on thresholds for private health insurance rebates, though the paid parental leave scheme is set to go ahead with a reduced income cap of $100,00.
