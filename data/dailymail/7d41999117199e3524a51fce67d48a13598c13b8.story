Former marine Brandon J. Raub has been detained for psychiatric testing

An ex-marine involuntarily detained for psychiatric questioning after posting anti-establishment messages on his Facebook page has sparked an outpouring of support from protestors who say the move is against his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.

Brandon J. Raub who served in both Iraq and Afghanistan was seized by authorities in Virginia’s Chesterfield County last Thursday for posting ‘ominous posts’ which refer to an upcoming revolution.

According to Authorities one message put up by the 26-year-old earlier this month stated: 'Sharpen my axe; I'm here to sever heads.'

After being questioned by secret 
service agents and the FBI, Mr Raub received a short hearing, before being detained in custody for 30 days.

Police
 used a state law which allows emergency, temporary psychiatric 
commitments upon the recommendation of a mental health professional to 
hold Mr Raub at the John Randolph Medical Centre in Hopewell, although 
he has not been charged with any crime.

But there has been a public backlash to the move with protesters taking to the street outside the hospital and Virginia-based civil liberties group, The Rutherford Institute, sending an attorney to the hospital to represent Mr Raub.

Rutherford executive director John Whitehead said: 'For government officials to not only arrest Brandon Raub for doing nothing more than exercising his First Amendment rights but to actually force him to undergo psychological evaluations and detain him against his will goes against every constitutional principle this country was founded upon.'

The detainment of the former marine has sparked angry protests by civil rights campaigners who says it goes against the First Amendment

Thousands of people have joined a string of  Facebook pages in support of Mr Raub which have sprung up since his detainment.

Speaking from the hospital yesterday Mr Raub said he was surprised by the turn of events. He added: ‘It’s ironic, I was considering re-enlisting, I’ve really enjoyed the six years I spent as a reserve and the two and a half years I spent on active duty.

‘I’ve been very open with the things I’ve had to say on my wall on Facebook. It’s interesting to me that the Government is watching Facebook in the first place. That ought to raise some eyebrows and cause some good American citizens some concern.’

A string of Facebook pages have been created in support of Mr Raub

Raub's mother, Cathleen Thomas, said by telephone that the government had overstepped its bounds.

'The bottom line is his freedom of speech has been violated,' she said.

Thomas said her son, who served tours as a combat engineer in Iraq and Afghanistan, is 'concerned about all the wars we've experienced' and believes the U.S. government was complicit in the September 11 terrorist attacks.

One of his Facebook posts, she said, pictured the gaping hole in the Pentagon and asked 'where's the plane?'

Whitehead said he found nothing 
alarming in Raub's social media commentaries. 'The posts I read that 
supposedly were of concern were libertarian-type posts I see all the 
time,' he said.

The big 
concern, Whitehead said, is whether government officials are monitoring 
citizens' private Facebook pages and detaining people with whom they 
disagree.

Dee Rybiski, an FBI spokeswoman in Richmond, said there was no Facebook snooping by her agency.

'We received quite a few complaints about what were perceived as threatening posts,' she said. 'Given the circumstances with the things that have gone on in the country with some of these mass shootings, it would be horrible for law enforcement not to pay attention to complaints.'

Campaigners have taken to the streets to protest against Mr Raub's detainment

Whitehead said some of the posts in question were made on a closed Facebook page that Raub had recently created so he questioned whether anyone from the public would have complained about them.

'Support Brandon Raub' Facebook pages have drawn significant interest, and other Internet sites had numerous comments from people outraged by the veteran's detention.

Raub's supporters characterized the detention as an arrest, complaining he was handcuffed and whisked away in a police cruiser without being served a warrant or read his rights. But authorities say it wasn't an arrest because Raub doesn't face criminal charges.

Colonel Thierry Dupuis, the county police chief, said Raub was taken into custody upon the recommendation of mental health crisis intervention workers.

He said the action was taken under the state's emergency custody statute, which allows a magistrate to order the civil detention and psychiatric evaluation of a person who is considered potentially dangerous.

He said Raub was handcuffed because he resisted officers' attempts to take him into custody.
