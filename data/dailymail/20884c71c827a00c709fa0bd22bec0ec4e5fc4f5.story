Promise: The prime minister has vowed to find a long-term reform for the notoriously complex charging system

Britain's most hated business tax, which costs firms around £24billion a year, will be fundamentally reformed, the Prime Minister claimed yesterday.

David Cameron said he totally understands the anger and resentment created by business rates, the corporate equivalent of council tax.

Speaking at the Federation of Small Businesses conference in London yesterday, he said: ‘I think we do need to look at longer term reform.

‘It is not going to be easy because rates raise whatever it is about £24billion and I don’t think there is any one solution that is going to make everybody happy.

‘But I think we’ve got to start addressing this issue, particularly this issue about internet retailing and high-street retailing.’

Mr Cameron said he agreed with Mike Cherry, the federation’s national policy chairman, who had asked what the Tory leader plans to do about business rates during yesterday’s conference.

Mr Cherry said: ‘Day in, day out, our members are still telling us that this is the biggest problem that they face going forwards. Will you finally tackle this by looking at how you could ensure a complete reform occurs?’

Speaking after the conference, Mr Cherry, a woodworking engineer by trade, slammed business rates as ‘a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st-century’.

The business rate charging system, which is notoriously complicated, involves the Valuation Office Agency setting the ‘per square metre’ charge for a premises, such as a shop.

This rate is then submitted to the local council which decides how much will be charged in business rates, subject to various reliefs and discounts.

Efforts: December's Autumn Statement gave small business owners a £2.5bn tax break on business rates, which came into effect yesterday, to stop empty shops blighting high streets

It has led to extraordinary situations in which a retailer in Rochdale has a higher ‘per square metre’ charge than Harrods, London’s exclusive department store.

Mr Cherry said: ‘Lots of our members are saying this is a fundamental issue. It is affecting far too many businesses.

'It is a tax paid before you even open the gates or the door. It is a tax which is not fit for purpose in the 21st-century.’

Ken Clarke claimed Mr Cameron is wrong to say his hands are tied by Brussels to make policy changes

In December’s Autumn Statement, small business owners were yesterday given a £2.5billion tax break on business rates in a desperate bid to stop empty shops blighting ailing high-streets.

Changes include a discount of up to £1,000 a year for small retail businesses on their business rate bills as well as capping the increase in April at two per cent.

Small business rate relief, which was due to end in the spring, was also extended for a further 12 months until April 2015, benefitting a total of 540,000 small firms.

It is not clear how business rates could be reformed, or when any changes will come into effect, but it is unlikely before the next general election.

Mr Cameron made his pledge as Ken Clarke yesterday put himself even further at odds with his more Eurosceptic colleagues by saying it is ‘mythology’ the UK is powerless to oppose Brussels regulations.

The Cabinet minister said it was not true that ‘heroic British ministers’ are resisting a slew of EU directives that tie up business in red tape.

He said: ‘It’s very hard to find an EU regulation of significance which has been forced on an unwilling British minister who voted against it.’ Mr Clarke added that such an idea ‘had always been a myth.’ Mr Clarke’s comments contradict those of his leader David Cameron last week, when he accused Europe of ‘burdensome, unjustified and premature regulatory burdens.’

A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said ‘a longer term review of business rates administration will consider the system’s transparency, efficiency and responsiveness.’
