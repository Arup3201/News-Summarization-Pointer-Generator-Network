George Zimmerman may not have to worry about jail time, but financial ruin is a distinct possibility.The family of Trayvon Martin is considering whether to sue Zimmerman in civil court for liability over the death of the unarmed teenager.  Zimmerman’s attorney, however, is convinced that his client is immune from such a suit. Having already admitted to shooting Martin, and with the burden of proof lower in civil court than in criminal court, Zimmerman may not emerge victorious from such a lawsuit.

Guilty or not guilty: George Zimmerman and his legal team waits for the verdict to be read Friday night

While no estimates have yet been floated as to the amount of financial liability Zimmerman may face in a civil suit, Martin’s family already settled with the town of Sanford, FL and the gated community Zimmerman shot the teenager in while patrolling as a volunteer neighborhood watchman.The housing complex doled out over $1 million to the grieving family, according to the Orlando Sentinal.

Should Martin’s family go that route, Mark O’Mara, Zimmerman’s attorney, feels his client is immune from liability.‘If someone believes that it’s appropriate to sue George Zimmerman, then we will seek and we will get immunity in a civil hearing,’ O’Mara said in a post-verdict press conference, adding ‘we will see just how many civil lawsuits are spawned from this fiasco.’

Florida law would also prevent George Zimmerman from selling the rights to his story for a book or movie deal in order to pay for a civil suit should he be found liable for Martin’s death, according to televised media reports.Zimmerman could also face trial on federal civil rights abuses in the death of the Florida teen. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Reverend Al Sharpton are working towards making that happen. The NAACP with a petition addressed directly to US Attorney General Eric Holder and Sharpton with planned meetings with community leaders in Florida and likely rallies to follow.The murder trial may be over, but Zimmerman’s 15 minutes of fame aren’t quite over yet, they might even still be just beginning.
