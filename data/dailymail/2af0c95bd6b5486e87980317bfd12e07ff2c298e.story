While President Obama worked crowds in North Carolina the first lady put the finishing touches on a renovated home for a medic wounded in Afghanistan in a campaign push of her own on Monday.

Washington D.C. resident Army Sgt. Johnny Agbi suffered brain and spinal cord injuries and uses a wheelchair, but can walk short distances with the aid of a cane.

Michelle Obama and Jill Biden visited his three-story rowhouse just blocks from the U.S. Capitol to paint the living room, a task helped by Mrs. Obama's 5'11 reach that meant she didn't even need a ladder.

The home underwent a $100,000 renovation under a program called Heroes at Home.

He's the 1,000th veteran whose home was renovated since the program began in 2007. Agbi says the changes have made a big difference in his life.

The first and second lady are also scheduled to attend the World Series opener in St. Louis on Wednesday night to honor military veterans.

Major League Baseball announced Monday that it has dedicated Game 1 between the Texas Rangers and St. Louis Cardinals to veterans and their families.

While Michelle spoke to volunteers about the home project, her husband tried to sell his jobs plan in North Carolina, where he hugged this diner during a stop at Countryside Barbecue restaurant in Marion

The first lady and Dr. Biden, the wife of Vice President Joe Biden, will participate in a pregame ceremony at Busch Stadium as part of the Welcome Back Veterans program and Obama's Joining Forces initiative.

Before the game, the two will join representatives from MLB and the St. Louis Cardinals, including Hall of Famer and Army veteran Red Schoendienst, at the St. Louis VA Medical Center for a military family appreciation event.

Obama and Biden also will participate in an interview on their Joining Forces initiative and answer questions submitted by fans through Facebook and Twitter.

The first lady is one of the president's secret weapons this campaign season, as her approval ratings are higher than his

'We are honored to have First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden join us for the 2011 Fall Classic to recognize the courageous men and women who serve the country as well as their families,' Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement.

'Major League Baseball has raised more than $11 million over the past several years through our Welcome Back Veterans program to help support veterans and their families.

'The World Series gives us the perfect opportunity to build on this ongoing commitment.'
