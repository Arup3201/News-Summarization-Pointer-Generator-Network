Scottish flyweight Reece McFadden claimed he looked into the eyes of Charlie Edwards and knew his confident quest for Commonwealth Games gold would continue following their battle at the SECC.

The 19-year-old from Forgewood had beaten the world's top amateur flyweight Andrew Selby on Friday night, saying afterwards: 'This gold is mine. This gold is my medal', before going on to say that he would beat Charlie Edwards next.

In a classic Scotland versus England last-16 clash in front of an enthusiastic crowd, Croydon boy Edwards, fighting for the first time after getting a first-round bye, had to fend off the hometown fighter in the first round and did so at times with some assurance as punches were exchanged but after three pulsating rounds, McFadden was given the unanimous decision.

Confident: Reece McFadden has the flyweight Commonwealth title in his sights after beating Charlie Edwards

The verdict did not impress the Englishman, who said: 'It is what you expect. Now he is the golden boy.

'I am not one who says I got robbed but I really thought I won it, I thought I did enough but that's the way it goes, we are in Scotland.'

However, McFadden claimed his take on a boxer's body language again confirmed the decision.

Going all the way: McFadden takes a punch from Edwards but after beating him he wants to win gold

He said: 'I knew I beat those two boys by them looking away. When my eyes were constantly on them they were looking away, looking at the referee, not wanting to know.

'That's when they are beat. I have noticed that with guys who have beat me or given me my toughest fight, they look at me square on, right at me.

'Those two boys didn't do that. But it doesn't matter if you stare at my eyes, I am still going to beat you anyway because I am the fittest I have ever been in my life and I am ready for a gold medal.'

Vocal support: Edwards thought McFadden benefitted from the support of the partisan crowd

Expanding on his view of the decision, Edwards said: 'It is what it is, you are in Scotland, you are in his back yard, with all that crowd cheering.

'I thought I won but in front of this Scottish crowd I would have had to done a right number on him.

'I thought I won but that's the way it goes, it is boxing. You get that all over the world, wherever you go, in everyone's backyard they (the local boxer) always get a bit of help. But I am a good sportsman. Good luck to him.'
