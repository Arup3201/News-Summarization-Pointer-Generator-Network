It's more than three decades since he burst on to the music scene.

And judging by the absence of hysteria in his presence these days, Sting no longer needs to tell fans: ‘Don’t stand so close to me.’

The Police singer was barely recognisable as he passed through JFK airport in New York, wearing studious-looking spectacles, something close to a scowl on his face and clutching his passport and guitar case.

In the years since his heyday, the razor-sharp cheekbones have rounded and the intense blue eyes are a little more world-weary.

There is less hair, though still a nod to fashion-consciousness with a hint of a Mohican.

Sting, 61, real name Gordon Sumner, is married to actress Trudie Styler and is a father of six.

He has won a string of accolades for his music both with The Police – whose hits include Roxanne, Don’t Stand So Close To Me and Every Breath You Take – and as a solo artist with songs such as An Englishman In New York.

The musician has enjoyed an illustrious career with five chart-topping hits with The Police and the group scooping six Grammy awards for their unique brand of reggae-tinged rock and minimalist pop.

Sting has scored 16 Grammy awards in total, three Brit awards, a Golden Globe, an Emmy and received several Oscar nominations for Best Song.

Although The Police stopped performing as a group in 1983 and consistently dismissed the idea of reforming, they embarked on a world tour in 2007.
