Thousands of commuters had their journeys thrown into chaos after blundering workmen flooded a Tube line with two million litres of water as they tried to fix a leaking pipe.

Hundreds of passengers were stranded for up to two hours yesterday, before having to escape along the tracks.

The chaos continued this morning, with the Central Line part-suspended and engineers desperately battling to reopen it for the evening rush hour.

One of London Underground’s biggest safety scares ever was caused by Thames Water engineers.

A senior Tube source said: 'We are usually to blame when things go wrong but this time we can put hand on heart and say, "It wasn’t our fault guv". It was 100 per cent down to Thames Water.

'This has caused one of the biggest safety scares ever. There was so much water pumping in that there were genuine concerns of a tunnel collapse or the water flooding along the tunnel and affecting other lines.'

The crisis happened between Stratford and Bow stations at 1.39pm yesterday as workmen were lifting a 24in main to try to plug a smaller leak.

But the above-ground pipe cracked, sending 440,000 gallons of pressurised water pouring down a ventilation shaft near Wick Lane.

Today the beleaguered utility firm, which has frequently attracted Transport for London’s anger for its 'pointless' and badly co-ordinated road- works, admitted responsibility for a 'tricky' operation going badly wrong.

A spokesman said: 'The pipe was encased in concrete and as the crew was working it broke.' Water from the burst caused signals to short-circuit and bring Central Line trains to a halt.

Thames Water, which boasts of its role as a supplier to the London Games this summer, now faces a multimillion-pound compensation bill after cars in streets and a housing estate near the Olympic Park were flooded.

Transport for London will also expect compensation after services this morning were suspended between Leytonstone and Stratford, causing massive overcrowding during the rush hour.

London Underground’s chief operating officer Howard Collins said the crisis was a 'nightmare scenario' for the Olympics, with just 50 days until the opening ceremony.

He said: 'As the person responsible for operational readiness, this is obviously something I do not want to happen during the time of the Olympics.'

One engineer told the Standard that water was flowing 'like Niagara Falls' onto the dual carriageway leading to the Blackwall Tunnel.

'I have never seen anything like it before,' he said. 'It was a massive incident. There was a river in the street.'

Cars parked in Wick Lane were flooded up to their bonnets, while a housing estate that has been earmarked for an anti-terrorist missile system was also affected.

Resident Neil Midgley, 43, said: 'The gym, swimming pool and car park were closed due to flooding.'

Tube passenger Kenneth Thurtell, 27, who was travelling from Holborn to Leytonstone, said: 'I spent four hours trying to get home. I felt suicidal, quite frankly. I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like during the Olympics.'

Jennifer Hazel, 38 — stranded at Mile End as she tried to get home to Leyton — said: 'If this is what happens when something goes wrong on a quiet day, then good luck during the Olympics.'

The Central line is one of two principal Tube routes for the Olympics, with the Jubilee, connecting London’s heart directly with the Stratford stadium.

Yesterday the Jubilee and Bakerloo lines each suffered two breakdowns, with the Jubilee suspended through central London. Two broken-down trains caused Victoria line delays.

Thames Water, which has been heavily criticised for causing roads gridlock with its lengthy repairs, said: 'We were doing exploratory work on the pipe in Wick Lane yesterday having identified it as a potential weak point on the network ahead of the Olympics.

'This is a 24-inch pipe which is more than 100 years old and when we dug down to investigate a suspected leak, the earth around the pipe moved causing it to burst.

'This has highlighted how weak the pipe was and the potential for it to burst at any time, so we are glad we can now get it replaced before the Olympics. We're really sorry for the disruption that has been caused.'
