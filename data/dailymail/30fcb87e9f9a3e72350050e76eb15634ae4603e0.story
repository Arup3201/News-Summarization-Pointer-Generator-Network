It is far less grand than Balmoral and has no souvenir shops or visitor car park.

But the Queen Mother’s secret ‘picnic cottage’, a two-and-a-half-mile hike away in the hills above the estate, has become a stop on the royal tourist trail.

The cottage hideaway, 1,400 feet above Balmoral, is where the Queen Mother hosted her legendary picnics.

Relaxed: The Queen Mum deep in conversation with her grandson Prince Charles over lunch in the sunshine outside the cottage. He was so captivated by the cottage, he often painted the view looking out to Lochnagar

Retreat: The Queen Mother hosted her legendary picnics at the remote cottage, where she could often be seen outside the cottage, enjoying rose champagne, a glass of gin or the sweet wine-based aperitif Dubonnet

She always served a lobster-prawn cocktail cum egg mayonnaise dish called Oeufs Drumkilbo and jam puffs. Lunch often came with a Bloody Bull – a substantial Bloody Mary cocktail with a kick like a mule.

Prince Charles was so captivated by the cottage in the former ‘fermtoun’ of Auchtavan, he often painted the view looking out to Lochnagar and over Ballochbuie forest.

Princess Anne has named her latest 40ft, £500,000 yacht after Ballochbuie. It was a special place for their grandmother, who could often be seen outside the cottage, enjoying rose champagne, a glass of gin or the sweet wine-based aperitif Dubonnet.

Now the cottage, which is free to the public and hosts regular open days, is an added attraction for those visiting the Balmoral estate.

That is if they can muster the energy to make the five-mile round trip through the hills above the River Dee.

Braemar Community, the group that has restored Auchtavan’s buildings, advises:

All welcome: Members of the public can visit the cottage at Auchtavan for free on its open days - if they can muster the energy to make the five-mile round trip through the hills above the River Dee

‘Good walking shoes and outdoor clothing are essential. An accurate map is also recommended.’

Auchtavan was once a thriving farm town of 16 cottages in Glen Feardar, with a population of 200. It is now a rare surviving example of a traditional Highland clachan – a  small settlement that lacks a church, post office or other formal building.

The Queen Mother’s two-up, two-down cottage was home to the last family ever to live in the glen, who are believed to have left in the 1950s. 

Basic: The interior of the two-up, two-down cottage is a far cry from the palaces the Royals are used to. It was home to the last family ever to live in the glen, who are believed to have left in the 1950s

Auchtavan still has a cottage with a rare ‘hinging lum’ – a hanging chimney above an open fire allowing smoke to exit through a hole in the roof.

It also has a threshing mill that was powered by horses in the 19th and 20th centuries.

The buildings have been returned to their original state by Braemar Community Ltd, with the help of the Heritage Lottery Fund, Historic Scotland and the Cairngorms Leader Fund.

Director Malcolm MacIntyre said: ‘About 20 people made it up on our last open day, including three Germans. They walked a long way because they took a wrong turn.

‘We also had a young woman with a child in a pushchair and a lady from Aberdeen whose great-great-grandmother came from Auchtavan. We are delighted to see people showing so much interest.’

He added: ‘It’s a window into the past and it is difficult to imagine just how hard life was at this altitude. On a sunny day it is beautiful, but in the winter they would have had to endure temperatures of minus 20 and below for days and be snowed in for weeks.’

The next open day will be on Sunday, September 21.
