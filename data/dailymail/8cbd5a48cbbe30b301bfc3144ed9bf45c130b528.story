An anonymous call to the Australian National Security hotline about gunman Man Haron Monis did not expose his deadly plan, Prime Minister Tony Abbott has said.

The tip-off was followed up, but Mr Abbott says it didn't reveal the imminent Sydney siege attack.

'The information provided didn't expose any threats of direct violence by the Martin Place murderer,' he told reporters.

'It was followed up, it was really followed up.'

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has insisted that the tip-off to the Australian National Security hotline about gunman Man Haron Monis was followed up and 'didn't expose any threats of direct violence'

The comments come after claims ASIO was forewarned about the self-styled sheikh's extremism by an anonymous caller, just two days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation.

Australia's Intelligence Organisation revealed the call advised them to 'take a look at this man's website', but did not suggest Monis was planning a terrorist attack, had a weapon or that he planned to take any hostages. 

The prime minister said a joint review between the federal and NSW governments will go through the siege events to determine what happened before, during and afterwards.

NSW Premier Mike Baird said the review was aimed at ensuring such a tragedy does not recur.

The premier did not comment on ASIO's involvement and put the blame solely on Monis.

'It is something that all of us have a heavy heart over but we have to go through this because we need to ensure every measure is taken to ensure it doesn't happen again,' Mr Baird told reporters.

'But I will say, there is one person who is responsible for the actions that happened in the past week and we know who he is. He came with an intent to divide this city but what he has done is united the city.' 

Just days before the Lindt Café Siege which rocked the nation, an anonymous caller rang the Australian National Security hotline to alert authorities about Man Haron Monis

It was reported that ASIO examined Monis's website as result of the phone call, which features rambling posts about terrorism fuelled protests in Martin Place,reports the Daily Telegraph. 

Monis had numerous social media websites, including a Twitter and Facebook account-the latter of which had 14,000 'likes'-which he used to preach extremist jihadist views. 

It comes after the revelation that Monis may have initially planned to attack the offices of Channel Seven in a terrorist attack. 

In 2009, Channel Seven's Today Tonight show exposed Monis for sending abusive 'condolence' letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan.

The program, which labelled Monis a 'Fake Sheik', led to his and his wife Amirah Droudis' conviction in the High Court over the letters.

On several occasions after the program aired, Monis protested on the steps outside the Seven Studio with pro-Islamic leaflets. 

In the early hours of Monday morning, it's understood the gunman walked around Martin Place before entering the Lindt Cafe and sitting for up to an hour before taking customers and staff hostage.   

Australia's Intelligence Organisation has revealed they received a call within 48 hours of the deadly siege, advising them to 'take a look at this man's website' 

One of Monis' former lawyers encountered the man in the cafe by chance on Monday morning and described his behaviour as distinctively calm.

'He was cool as a cucumber, not agitated, not scoping the place out, not looking over his shoulder,' said the lawyer. 'He kept asking, 'Why are you here?'. I think he was genuinely surprised to see me there.'  

The evidence comes after reports that the siege gunman told police in 2008 he planned terrorism-related 'protests' in Martin Place just metres from the café where he took 18 hostages this week. 

Man Haron Monis also wrote letters to Qantas's chief executive in 2009 suggesting he had information about sabotage at the airline that would lead to mass casualties.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has launched a major investigation into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list  despite numerous examples of extremist views and behaviour, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

In one post on his website, Monis writes about a meeting he allegedly had with New South Wales police in 2008 in which he claims one of the detectives asked him about a protest outside the Seven Network studios in Martin Place against the way the network's program Sunrise had reported a terrorist attack overseas.

The protest was carried out by Monis' wife, Amirah Doudis.

According to the post, Monis was asked by police if he planned further protests in Martin Place, to which he replied: 'Well, it depends if the Australian government condemns the terrorist comment which was broadcast by Sunrise (then) I don't have to continue but if the Attorney-General doesn't condemn Channel 7 for its terrorist act I believe it is my religious duty to continue.' 

He wrote that he also told police during the discussion: 'If our fair defence against your unfair attack is called terrorism, we are proud to be called terrorists.'

The Seven studio is immediately opposite the Lindt café on Martin Place that Monis raided this week.

The revelations comes as a major investigation called by Prime Minister Tony Abbott gets underway into why security services allowed Monis to drop off a terrorism watch list in 2009

A separate post in August 2008 revealed Monis' writings to then-Qantas chief executive office Geoff Dixon.

Monis wrote to Mr Dixon: 'I have sent you a letter warning dated July 28 about upcoming technical problems which will be caused deliberately by some people within Qantas... if you do not take my warning seriously Qantas will witness similar technical problems. .. if you keep ignoring my offer for sharing information you will be responsible for the death or injury of people...'

Qantas reportedly referred Monis' letters to Australian Federal Police at the time.

Monis was also on bail for a long list of charges, including sexual offences, conspiracy to murder his ex-wife and a series of abhorrent letters.

In September 2013, Monis was sentenced to 300 hours community service for a series of letters he sent to the families of seven Australian soldiers killed between 2007 and 2009.

In the letters, Monis likened soldiers to murderers and killers, and in one letter said the man was going to hell.

Monis was also on bail on a charge of conspiring with his girlfriend, Amirah Droudis, who is allegedly a Muslim convert, to murder Noleen Hayson Pal.

Ms Pal was lured to the Werrington apartment block in western Sydney and allegedly doused with accelerant, set alight and then stabbed 18 times by Droudis.

Monis and Amirah Droudis were arrested on November 15 last year and charged.

Monis also had outstanding charges over allegations of indecent and sexual assault relating to his career as 'a spiritual healer'.

He was due in court due in court in February next year for the sexual assault charges, which included 22 counts of aggravated sexual assault and 14 counts of aggravated indecent assault against seven women, including one 27-year-old who answered his ads placed in ethnic Sydney newspapers.

Speaking to ABC, Prime Minister Tony Abbott questioned  why Moni- who was well known to both federal police and ASIO - was not on any counter-terrorism watch lists.

'These are the questions that we'll be having our officials ponder because he was a person who had been of interest to our security agencies,' Mr Abbott said.

'We want to know why he wasn't being monitored, given his history of violence, his history of mental instability, and his history of infatuation with extremism.'

The Prime Minister said Monis was inadequately dealt with, and that the events of the siege should serve as a grave learning lesson.

He announced an urgent review to examine why  Monis had access to firearms and why he was granted citizenship in Australia.
