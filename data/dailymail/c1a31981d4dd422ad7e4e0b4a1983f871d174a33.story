'Chumocracy': David Cameron, pictured yesterday, has hired one of his best friends for a No. 10 position

David Cameron was accused of cronyism again last night after appointing one of his best friends, Earl Spencer’s former brother-in-law, to a job in Downing Street.

Journalist Christopher Lockwood, whose sister married Princess Diana’s brother, will take up a post in the No 10 policy unit.

Mr Lockwood was described by the Prime Minister as one of his closest friends when he gave evidence to Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry into Press standards.

The pair are so close that they once went on holiday together to Italy.

His appointment caused despair among Tory MPs who think Mr Cameron is unwilling to trust people from outside his social circle.

‘Great move, Dave,’ one said.

‘Good luck trying to argue we are not a bunch of toffs after this.’

Tim Montgomerie, a former Conservative chief of staff, said: ‘Extraordinary that Cameron has appointed yet another mate to Number 10.

'Where is the openness to new thinking from different backgrounds?’ 

And a Tory minister said: ‘Many of us wanted the Downing Street operation beefed up but the biggest problem we’ve got is looking like we’re out of touch. Picking another crony doesn’t help.’

Last week Mr Cameron brought in Boris Johnson’s brother Jo to run his policy unit. Mr Johnson, like Mr Cameron and the London Mayor, is an Old Etonian and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford.

Mr Lockwood was educated at St Paul’s 
School, the exclusive London independent school that Chancellor George 
Osborne also attended.

Political pals: David Cameron recently hired Boris Johnson's brother Jo, yet another fellow Etonian and Oxford graduate, to run the policy unit where Mr Lockwood will be working

He studied PPE at Oxford and later became Boris Johnson’s deputy at the Daily Telegraph’s Brussels bureau.

The appointment lays bare the ‘chumocracy’ of public schoolboys Mr Cameron has invited into No 10.

However last night Mr Cameron dismissed claims that he promotes people based on social class. He said: ‘I choose the most talented people.

‘I judge people by what they can do, what they can bring, by the quality of their brains and the passion in their hearts, not which school they went to.’
