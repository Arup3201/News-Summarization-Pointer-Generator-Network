Carl Froch’s stunning win over George Groves at Wembley in May can now officially be declared the biggest grossing fight on British soil in history, with the largest ever purse, of £10million. Froch took home £8m and Groves £2m.

Sportsmail’s analysis of the finances behind the occasion shows the total income from the night was more than £22m, more than any other fight in Britain, while the crowd of 77,000 beat the previous British record of just over 70,000, set in 1933 at White City when Jack Petersen beat Jack Doyle.

What started out as a straightforward rematch quickly gained momentum as a sporting and marketing phenomenon. As Froch said, it was ‘the fight the British public want to see’.

Froch had won their first fight in controversial fashion in November last year, and as soon as promoter Eddie Hearn put the tickets on sale for Wembley — where pride and bragging rights were up for grabs as much as Froch’s IBF and WBA Super Middleweight titles — 60,000 were sold within an hour.

A further 20,000 were made available and most of those quickly went as well.

With prices ranging from £30 to £500, the evening was affordable to a vast demographic of fight fans who flocked to London from all parts of the country.

The total gate receipts were £6m, putting the average price paid at £78 per person.

Millions watched via pay-per-view (PPV) on Sky, either at home or in pubs and clubs around the country. The PPV sales were around 900,000 at £16.95, giving a UK take of just over £15m.

The way in which this cash is split is strictly confidential, but it is understood Sky took around 50 per cent of the PPV income and, as part of that deal, paid for the production and promotional costs.

The amount generated from pay per view sales for Floyd Mayweather Jr v Saul Alvarez in 2013 - the current world record.

The fight was shown on television in 60 countries, including on HBO in America, but the international income was on a much lower level than domestic earnings — to be expected for an all-British fight.

The international TV take was around $1m (£580,000).

The fight also attracted sponsorship partners who poured around £250,000 into the coffers.

Merchandise and hospitality sales added another £250,000 for a grand total of around £22.3m.

Down you go: Froch sends Groves to the canvas to win the fight and retain his titles

The biggest expense was the purse for Froch and Groves, the former keeping his titles and the lion’s share of the money thanks to that sensational right-hand knockout punch in the eighth round.

Sky were the second biggest beneficiaries with their share of the PPV cash, while the FA earned £500,000 for renting out Wembley.

A similar amount went on the undercard purses.

Policing costs were included in the Wembley bill but extra security came out of the takings.

Promoter overheads, VAT and logistical costs made up the rest of the spend on the biggest night of boxing on British soil — in all senses.
