Lewis Hamilton admitted he didn’t expect to triumph at Silverstone on Sunday after his qualifying error and said the home support spurred him on to victory.

The Mercedes driver, who started from sixth position, reinvigorated his world title ambitions by claiming his fifth win of the season in front of a cheering crowd of 112,000, and moved to within four points of team-mate Nico Rosberg at the top of the standings.

It was all the sweeter given what had gone before.

Hamilton had left the circuit disappointed on Saturday after aborting his final qualifying lap, believing conditions were not good enough to improve on his previous time only for Rosberg to take pole.

‘Yesterday was a really difficult day,’ he said of that mistake. ‘I went away feeling terrible for the fans.

'I felt I had let them down. Coming back today, trying to turn that serious emptiness and negativity into a positive was really my priority.

Hamilton’s last win was at the Spanish Grand Prix in May, since when he has lost out in every significant area to Rosberg, a German who has worked with cool calculation.

But yesterday’s win takes him to 27 career wins — equal with Sir Jackie Stewart.

The next race comes in a fortnight at Hockenheim. Hamilton said he was unfazed by racing against Rosberg on his home turf, adding: ‘Nico doesn’t have one-eighth of the support us Brits get here. I’ve just got to put the laps together and, when I do, I think the opportunities will come.’
