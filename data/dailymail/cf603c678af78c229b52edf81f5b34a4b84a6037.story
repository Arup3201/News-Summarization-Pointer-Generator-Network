Supporters across the globe were left open-mouthed at the sight of James Rodriguez spectacular volley against Uruguay on Saturday night.

The Colombian playmaker unleashed a perfectly executed strike at goal as the ball flew through the air and crashed against the under side of the cross bar and into the net.

While the world applauded one of the finest goals seen at the World Cup, one Colombian commentary team went ballistic.

The man behind the mic could not contain his excitement and shoutedÂ  'Gol, Gol, Gol' at the top of his lungs.

Amazingly the reporter was able to keep his breath during all of the pandemonium as he bellowed 'Gol' for two ten second spells!

It's unthinkable how the country will react should the Colombians go on to win the competition.
