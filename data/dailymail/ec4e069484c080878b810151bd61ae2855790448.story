Plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care have been revived by the Labour Party.

The idea was floated before the last election by Labour but was dropped after intense criticism from the Conservatives.

But Labour’s health spokesman Andy Burnham has restated his desire to introduce the scheme that would see estates of the deceased taxed at 15 per cent.

Labour has revived plans to impose a compulsory ‘death tax’ levy of up to 15 per cent to pay for elderly care

The Tory Party has again derided the idea after it emerged that Labour was holding ‘internal party discussions’ on the issue.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt described the levy as a ‘secret tax bombshell’ and said ‘pensioners deserve better’.

The plans will prompt criticism that Labour is targeting the wealthy, who are likely to be charged on top of the 40 per cent inheritance tax rate.

The plan would also cost the average Briton £46,000 on a 15 per cent tax, the Conservatives claimed.

Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham said that the death tax was 'the best way' to fund elderly social care - but admitted the plan was controversial

The social care green paper was first unveiled by Mr Burnham in 2009, which included a favoured compulsory insurance scheme.

A later incarnation, which suggested pensioners should pay 10 per cent of their estates rather than a flat rate of £20,000, was lambasted by the Conservatives.

The Coalition has pledged to tackle England’s care crisis scandal by stating that no one will have to pay their care costs if they spend more than £72,000. 

The rising cost of care can see the elderly facing unlimited expense, leading to tens of thousands having to sell their homes every year.

Mr Burnham said the death tax was ‘the best way’ to fund social care – but admitted the plan was controversial.

He added: ‘It’s only where you create a system where everyone is in and everyone is then covered, that I think you’ll be able to help people protect their own homes.

‘If you have that system, people would pay, let’s say, ten, 15 whatever it might be per cent, well then they would be able to pay that as an insurance payment to protect the other 85 per cent that they would otherwise stand to lose.’

Mr Hunt said: ‘People who save all their lives deserve better than a secret tax bombshell if Labour were ever to get in.’
