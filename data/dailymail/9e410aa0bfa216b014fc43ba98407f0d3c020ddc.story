Tony Bellew wants to end Nathan Cleverly's career when the pair square off in their grudge re-match, the details of which are expected to be announced later this week.

Bellew dropped a majority points decision to his British rival in their bout for the WBO light-heavyweight title in October 2011 and the Liverpudlian has been itching to set the record straight ever since.

With both fighters moving up to the cruiserweight division and promoted by Eddie Hearn's Matchroom team, a return bout is close to being finalised.

And Bellew, never one to mince words, will relish the chance to step in the ring with his biggest foe once again.

'I don't just want to beat him, I want to finish him,' said the 31-year-old (22-2-1, 14KOs).

'He won't want to get in the ring ever again after our fight. Putting the record straight means more to me than a world title.

'I'm going to put myself through hell in camp and picture his face during every moment. I cannot wait.'

The duo were being touted as chief support to IBF welterweight titlist Kell Brook's homecoming at Sheffield on December 6 but with the world champion out of action until next year after being stabbed while on holiday earlier this month, Hearn has had to look elsewhere.

'We are almost there,' said Hearn. 'Having been originally set for December 6, we are now finalising a new date and venue and I hope to have the deal tied up this week.'

Cleverly, who dropped his world title to the hard-hitting Sergey Kovalev last year but has bounced back with two wins in the cruiserweight division, is looking to use the bout to re-establish his world title credentials at the 200lb limit.

'I've always said I will fight him any time, anywhere, the result will be the same as before, a Nathan Cleverly victory,' he said.

'The only slight change this time is I doubt he will hear the final bell. I'm excited for the fight, it will capture the public's imagination and become a huge event. I'm looking forward to making it 2-0 and moving on to a shot at the title.'
