Kelly Brook's fiance will not face any further charges over the reasons he gave for crashing a van full of dead badgers during the controversial cull.

David McIntosh, who is known for appearing in TV series Gladiator as ‘Tornado’, had been employed to take the dead creatures for disposal as part of the badger cull in Gloucestershire.

But as the 28-year-old former Royal Marine drove his VW Transporter van to a furnace in the middle of the night, he swerved and smashed into a bus stop.

He was fined and given six penalty points at court but in a statement said he lost control when a radio - which police used to pass on intelligence about the location of anti-cull protesters - fell under the brakes.

The claims triggered a denial from police meaning McIntosh faced a potential perjury charge after the hearing.

But Gloucestershire Police have now said they are taking no further action - leading to criticism from anti-cull campaigners over the validity of the claims.

A spokesman for the force said: 'We are not taking any further action in connection with it.

'We were looking at whether there there should be any further action as we didn’t agree with what was said in court.

'I believe the court would have had to make a complaint - that was one of the reasons [for not taking action].

'Further action was deemed not to be proportionate.'

But anti-cull protestor Peter Martin said they always accepted McIntosh’s claims were true and added: 'The police have been very cosy with the cull operatives all along - no wonder he’s off the hook.'

McIntosh crashed after falling asleep during the night shift in Gloucester city centre just before 1am on September 29. He admitted driving without due care and attention and not having a valid licence.

Passenger John Parker - who suffered bruised ribs, thigh, face and wrist in the crash - told the court he was checking Facebook on his phone when he felt the van change direction.

District Judge Joti Bopa-Rai at Stroud Magistrates Court said: 'It is either that he has fallen asleep or been distracted.'

McIntosh, of Altrincham, Cheshire, was fined £91, plus a £20 victim surcharge and £30 prosecution costs.

The couple got engaged last month and Kelly announced the news by posting a snap of her and the former Gladiators star holding a balloon with the words 'Engaged' across the front on her Instagram page

He was given six penalty points.

Natural England authorised two pilot culls of badgers, which was paid for by the farming industry.

A
 spokesman for the public body said that it issued licenses to culling 
companies which in turn employed their own marksmen. He added: ‘Daniel 
McIntosh is not a Natural England employee.'

McIntosh is a British TV personality, model, bodybuilder and former ‘security operative’.

He
 has served in Afghanistan, Northern Ireland, Somalia, and the Persian 
Gulf. He was deployed to Afghanistan in October 2008 for six months.

Kelly has previously posed for campaigns for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) - who opposed the cull.

The
 couple got engaged last month and Kelly announced the news by posting a photo of her and the former Gladiators star holding a balloon with the 
words 'Engaged' across the front on her Instagram page.
