one year supervision order for breaching an ASBO banning her from feeding birds

A pensioner nicknamed the ‘Pigeon Lady of Pimlico’ has walked free from court despite flouting an ASBO banning her from feeding the birds near her home.

Nadia Lee, 67, spent 25 years feeding the pigeons on the streets of the London borough, giving them homeopathic therapy and taking injured birds to a sanctuary.

She became renowned for putting pigeons in her Gucci handbag and taking them to her £750,000 Georgian maisonette where she rubbed their wings with lavender.

However, she was handed an ASBO in December 2011 after neighbours complained their cars and homes were being splattered with bird droppings and the feed was attracting rats.

But Lee ignored the order and was found to have breached it on October 14, 2012, following a trial at Southwark Crown Court in January this year.

During the trial, the jury were unable to agree on two further alleged breaches in July 2012, which were discharged.

Privately educated Lee, a former secretary and pilot’s daughter, was deemed unfit to plead to the charges due to suffering from multiple personality disorder.

Medical reports also found Lee was suffering post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and stress.

Sentencing Lee to a one year supervision order, Judge Martin Beddoe warned her: ‘I remind you, Ms Lee, your ASBO is still in place.

‘As far as I am able to tell, you are capable of complying with that order. If you fail to comply with it, you may well be prosecuted again.’

In the event of a further breach, the court may rule she is fit to plead, Judge Beddoe said.

‘The powers of the court in those circumstances, in dealing with any breach of your ASBO, may prove to be more extensive,’ he added.

Wearing a blue sweater and dark jeans grey-haired Lee was permitted to sit outside of the glass-enclosed dock for the 30-minute hearing. She showed no emotion as the ruling was made.

The pensioner has been forced to sell her home due to financial difficulties and move out of the area, the court heard.

When the ASBO was originally granted, Lee said she had turned into a self-styled ‘bin lady’ after her mother’s death two decades ago.

Seven residents and two council officials told how they were unable to enjoy the roof terraces and gardens of their multi-million pound homes because of pigeon droppings.

One neighbour, Austen Iverleigh, said: ‘She generates squalor on an industrial scale.

‘Whenever I have spoken to her, she has been very polite and I am sure that in any other respect, she is a very nice and reasonable person.

‘The problem is the feeding of pigeons on a huge scale, which causes serious disturbance to those around her. I have seen rats in her basement.’

Egyptian-born Lee told the court: ‘You cannot rescue pigeons without putting down seed and getting them all together.

‘I then catch them in a net, which I carry with me everywhere I go.

‘Then I put them in Gucci bags hanging off my pram. I take them home and take the string off their feet, rub them in lavender and treat them with homeopathy.

‘If they are too injured, I take them to a pigeon sanctuary. I love them and they depend on me because I have raised them all their lives.’

Duncan Jones, for the defence, said Lee was ‘an extremely vulnerable person’ and had ‘suffered greatly’ as a result of her court ordeal.

He said: ‘She has had considerable difficulties in her life.

‘This whole experience has really been very traumatic for Ms Lee’.

Lee will be supervised by probation for 12 months.
