Letter: Bernie Madoff, pictured, spent Christmas Eve bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell

While most of America spent December 24 gearing up for Christmas, Bernie Madoff was bemoaning the state of the financial system from his prison cell.

The white collar criminal who pleaded guilty nearly four years ago to running one of the biggest Ponzi schemes in U.S. history, sent a letter on Christmas Eve to CNBC detailing his thoughts.

In the note, Madoff lambasted the lack of transparency in financial markets and quashed the idea that insider trading was a new phenomenon, after a raft of recent cases.

'(O)ne would be led to believe that with the recent spate of insider trading prosecution that insider trading is a new development,' he wrote. 'This is false. It has been present in the market forever, but rarely prosecuted.'

The letter, which is bizarrely littered with spelling mistakes, was penned from the medium security federal prison in North Carolina where he is serving a 150-year sentence.

Madoff has granted only a handful of interviews since he went to prison in 2009 and more recently has refused to speak on the record about his case.

But he was willing to share some Madoff wisdom in the e-mail, which he sent to the TV station and a handful of attorneys and academics who he has been communicating with, according to CNBC.

'A number of you have been asking my views on a couple of subjects that I am comfortable in going on the record, because they are not related to my case,' he started off, 'there for(sic) the following are remarks that you are free to use for whatever value you feel are appropriate.'

In the letter, he said front running - the illegal practice of brokers using knowledge of their customers' pending orders to trade for their own accounts first - was also commonplace and had been going on 'forever.'

He said the 'lack of transparency' was created by the growth of so-called 'dark pools' or arrangements outside the established stock exchanges that allow parties to trade stocks privately, with trades and prices only disclosed after the fact.

'Institutions have always attempted to guard this buy and sell information from exposure to the market for fear of being front run,' Madoff wrote.

'Certainly they are entitled to have this right of confidentiality. That being said, the more secret this information, the more valuable this information is to those that can obtain it. Therein lies the problem. It is naive to think that there will be no leakage of this information.'

Before his epic scam, Madoff was prominent in the financial community. He served as a non-executive chairman of the NASDAQ, and his firm was once among the largest on Wall Street.

He built his fraud on one of the largest hedge funds in the U.S., which attracted investments from individuals as well as a series of so-called 'feeder funds.'

According to CNBC, Madoff says the rapid growth of hedge funds and feeder funds, with their commissions and fees, have created a problem for investors and regulators.

'It has been this additional layer of costs that have created the need for more risk to be taken to earn worthwhile returns. This has created a minefield of regulatory problems involving the very reasons that the desire for a lack of transparency has grown. Both of these areas are going to be the greatest challenge that both the industry and the regulators are going to face.'
