A jealous ex who cut off his former girlfriend’s hair and then stripped her naked in the kitchen after she returned late from a night out has been jailed.

Jay Peeks, 27, waited at his former partner’s flat and then launched the savage attack when she arrived at 4am on May 6.

Manchester Crown Court was told that Peeks, who did not live with his victim but had a key to her flat, had shouted: ‘Where have you been, you slag?’

Manchester Crown Court heard that Peeks launched the attack when his former girlfriend returned from a night out

He then grabbed scissors from a kitchen draw and cut off a big clump of her hair.

Lindsay Thomas, prosecuting, said: ‘She was crying hysterically. She tried to get away from him, but he grabbed hold of her and started to tear off her clothes. She pleaded with him to stop.

‘She was naked at that point and sat in a corner crying. She describes herself as being petrified.’

The court heard that Peeks went out of the room and returned with a pair of hair clippers and shaved off part of her eyebrow.

He then took photographs of her before she managed to find some other clothes and escape into the street, where she flagged down a taxi. The next day Peeks sent her the photographs in a series of abusive text messages.

Peeks admitted admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage

When she finally returned home, she found that Peeks had cut up her £1,000 handbag, had destroyed a pair of shoes and had left her torn up clothes on the kitchen floor.

The victim said in a statement read out in court that the incident had been terrifying and humiliating and the relationship with Peeks was now over.

She said he had never previously been violent towards her and the incident had shaken her confidence.

Peeks, of Mallow Street, Hulme, admitted assault occasioning actual bodily harm and criminal damage when he appeared at Manchester Crown Court.

The court heard he had previous convictions, but none of them were for violence against his partner.

The couple had been together for seven years and had a five year old son, but had split up before the attack.

They had agreed to meet at her flat on the night of the attack.

Ms Thomas said the victim believed Peeks had now ‘learned his lesson’ and she did not want a restraining order to be placed upon him as she still wanted him to have access to his son.

Robert Lancaster, defending, said: ‘What Mr Peeks did that night was appalling. His behaviour was about exerting power and humiliation. It must have been an entirely frightening and demeaning incident and there is nothing I can say on his behalf that can justify that type of behaviour.’

He said it would be better for Peeks’ issues of paranoia and jealousy to be dealt with by probation service, rather than for him to be sent to prison.

Miss Recorder Barrie, sentencing, jailed Peeks for 14 months for the assault. She jailed him for two months concurrently for the damage he caused and he was ordered to pay a £100 victim surcharge.

She told Peeks: ‘The facts of this case are disturbing. You proceeded to humiliate and terrorise her and you cut off her hair.

‘There were a number of aggravating factors. She was particularly vulnerable having been stripped naked. This was gratuitous degradation.’
