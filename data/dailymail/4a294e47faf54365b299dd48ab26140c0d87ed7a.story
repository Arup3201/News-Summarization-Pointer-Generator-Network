Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg personally intervened to help a charity linked to his wife Miriam obtain £12 million of taxpayers’ money.

Labour and Tories joined forces to call for an investigation last night after leaked emails showed one of the Lib Dem leader’s key aides lobbied for Booktrust to be given the grant, instead of competing with other charities.

The organisation announced last week that it had secured £6 million for each of the next two years, while other charities will have to wait until next year – and some will get nothing.

By the book? Nick and Miriam Clegg at the theatre on Saturday night as Labour and Tories joined forces to call for an investigation into leaked emails showing one of the Lib Dem leader's key aides lobbied for Booktrust - a charity linked to Miriam - to be given a grant

The charity has previously received 
Department for Education funding – but the new award secures that until 
2015. According to sources in Mr Clegg’s Cabinet Office, his aide Matt 
Sanders referred in conversation to the fact that Mrs Clegg – a 
prominent supporter of the charity – hosted a function for them just 
weeks earlier.

A Whitehall insider said: ‘There was 
unease at the way that it appeared Mr Clegg wanted special treatment for
Booktrust, and the fact that Miriam’s name came up.’

It is understood that emails show 
that senior civil servants expressed concern at the way the bidding 
process had apparently been manipulated to benefit Booktrust.

When the claims were put to the Education Department last night, an official spokesman said: ‘We have no comment.’

Lavish reception: As a prominent supporter of the charity, Miriam addressed Booktrust's 20th anniversary event in October

A spokesman for Mr Clegg last night 
confirmed that he had asked for Booktrust to be given the £6 
million-a-year grant without having to make a special bid for it. But he
denied Mrs Clegg’s link to the charity had been used in any way and 
said there had been ‘no wrongdoing’.

Mrs Clegg, who uses her professional 
name Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, hosted a lavish reception for Booktrust 
in October at one of London’s most grandiose venues, historic Lancaster 
House.

Suggestion of impropriety is 'completely wrong': The decision to fast-track the money was made by Education Secretary Michael Gove

Mr Sanders confirmed he sent emails 
to the Education Department asking for the charity to get the money 
directly – and that he had said Mr Clegg favoured the move.

He said he 
had mentioned Mrs Clegg with regard to Booktrust, but only with regards 
to the event. He added: ‘I asked for a briefing from officials before 
attending the Booktrust event. But I did not mention her name with 
regard to funding.’

Significantly, the emails were sent 
from Mr Sanders’ official Cabinet Office email address, meaning they can
be subject to future scrutiny.

Mr Clegg’s spokeswoman said there was
nothing improper about Mr Clegg’s close interest in the Booktrust 
grant. ‘Any suggestion of impropriety is completely wrong,’ she said. 
‘Miriam has no role within the charity, beyond being supportive of its 
excellent work.’

The decision to fast-track the money 
was made by Education Secretary Michael Gove on the advice of officials,
she said. And a No 10 spokesman said that David Cameron also fully 
backed the decision.

Mr Clegg’s spokeswoman also said: ‘Miriam has no role in any decisions made by the Government.’

Mr Sanders, who also advises Lib Dem 
Schools Minister David Laws, said he made it clear to officials that 
both he and Mr Clegg believed Booktrust should be given the £6 million a
year without having to bid for it.

He said other officials supported 
this view and that the final decision was taken by Mr Gove. There is no 
suggestion of any wrongdoing by Booktrust, which has given away 40 
million books to schoolchildren in the past 20 years. It has received 
Government grants since 2004.

Thankful: Booktrust chief executive Viv Bird said of the funding: 'I am grateful to Ministers for this vote of confidence'

In 2011, the Department for Education
awarded it £13.5 million over two years; and last Thursday the charity 
announced that it had secured another £6 million for both 2013/14 and 
2014/15. Chief executive Viv Bird said: ‘I am grateful to Ministers for 
this vote of confidence.’

At the charity’s 20th anniversary 
party in October, Spanish-born Mrs Clegg said she fell in love with 
Britain through reading Enid Blyton’s stories and was keen to encourage 
her three sons to read. She quoted Roald Dahl’s Oompa Loompa song, from 
Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, ‘So please, oh please, we beg, we 
pray, Go throw your TV set away, And in its place you can install, A 
lovely bookshelf on the wall.’

The book formed the theme for Mr Clegg’s Christmas party for Lib Dem MPs last week.

On the Booktrust’s website, Mrs Clegg
is quoted praising The Gruffalo as ‘the single favourite book at home’ 
and last night she and her husband attended a stage production of 
Gruffalo author Julia Donaldson’s Room On The Broom in London.

Inquiry into how grant was made: Tory MP Peter Bone (right) says Mr Clegg will have 'serious questions to answer' on the award of public money and Labour MP John Mann (left) said MPs should not interfere on behalf of a body

Last night, Labour and Tory MPs 
called for an inquiry into how the Booktrust grant was made, and for all
relevant emails to be published.

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘If there 
was undue influence over the award of this money, Mr Clegg will have 
very serious questions to answer.

‘No one is questioning the good work 
of this charity but I would be very concerned if communications from his
office have been used to influence the award of public money. There 
should be a Cabinet Office inquiry and I will be writing to the Cabinet 
Secretary about this.’

Labour MP John Mann said: ‘Any grant involving public money must be handled the right way.

Ministers should not interfere on 
behalf of one body. There needs to be a full inquiry and that means 
publishing all relevant communications.’

As part of a savings drive, Booktrust
and other similar groups had been told that this year they would have 
to compete for a share of a £60 million Government pot – submitting a 
proposal before January.
