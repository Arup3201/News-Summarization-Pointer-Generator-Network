There were some impressive performances during Saturday night's heat of Let's Dance for Comic Relief.

But without a doubt Vanessa Feltz stole the show with her racy and entertaining performance to Cher's If I Could Turn Back Time.

Dressed as the famous singer in a revealing high leg leotard and black wig the radio presenter wowed the crowds, judges and her fiance Ben Ofoedu as she straddled a cannon.

Bang: Vanessa Feltz ended the dance performances on the show by straddling a canon as she appeared on Let's Dance For Comic Relief

In fact Ben was so taken by her performance that afterwards he said: 'As long as she can keep that outfit I will be a very happy man.'

The 51-year-old, who was last up on the show, came down from the ceiling suspended on wires to straddle a canyon while surrounded by sailor dancers.

Dressed as Cher she wore an extremely high leg revealing leotard and fringed leather jacket, complete with curly black wig.

Lookalike: Vanessa did her best impression of Cher complete with the black curly wig

During her performance she stood on the edge of a boat recreating the famous Titanic ‘I’m the king of the world scene.’

Not really dancing more strutting up and down, she ended her performance by mounting the cannon again which exploded at the end.

Following her dance an out of breath Vanessa said: 'I’d like to apologise to my family, friends, society... ahhh.'

Revealing: Vanessa's leotard featured a number of sheer sections and was very high legged

Arlene spoke first out of the judges saying: 'I will never forget that image of you coming out of the sky as a weapon of dance destruction.'

While Greg James ran up to give her a hug telling her that she was amazing.

Jokingly Lee said: 'I wish I could turn back time. I’ve seen some brilliant dances in my time but that was something else.'

Interaction: Vanessa made sure that she danced near the show's judges as they looked a little taken aback by her performance

Her proud daughter Allegra: 'She has been really nervous but mum we are really proud of you.’

Making up the judging panel on Saturday's show was former Strictly Come Dancing judge Arlene Phillips who is certainly in the know when it comes to choreography

Funny man Lee Mack joined her bringing his expertise on comedy and entertainment.

Hello sailor: Vanessa performed with a number of backing dancers dressed as sailors

Radio
1 DJ Greg James also took a place on the panel - Greg is no stranger to
dancing as he regularly impersonates female dancers.

Newsreaders Ore Oduba and Sonali Shah, who first met on News Round were up first, describing their performance as 'fast, risque and sweaty.'  before taking to the stage.

The duo kicked off the show with an energetic routine to Outkast's Hey Ya, which saw Sonali dressed in a pink and yellow sixties style dress complete with white knee high boots.

Ore, meanwhile was dressed as Outkast singer Andre 300, as they were joined on stage by a collection of themed dancers who really helped bring the performance together.

Following their performance Alex turned them to say: 'You were great.'

It seems the routine may have taken it's toll on Ore, as he said: 'I feel like I have eaten about seven sticks of chalk'

Hey Ya: Ore Oduba and Sonali Shah performed to a song by Outkast but didn't manage to win a place in the final

Arelene commented: 'No seriously that was good, I mean good, You look a bit like dancing jellybeans. You are like the Mary Berry, Paul Hollywood of dance. No soggy bottoms there.'

Greg added: 'I think the real Outkast will be sat at home depressed because you are better than them. I thought you were meant to be rubbish!'

Louis Smith, who was sat in the audience commented on the performance, saying: 'I though it was brilliant, very entertaining.'

Stand in: Jodie Prenger took the place of Keith Duffy and managed to secure the most public votes

Jodie Prenger stepped in last minute to replace Boyzone's Keith Duffy who had to forgo his place on the show this week, due to ‘unforeseen circumstances’.

The West End star appeared on stage dancing to Word Up by Cameo with a black wig and mustache with a leather jacket with red sparkle detail.

She wore a red nose on her crotch, as did her two backing dancers. These lit up in one point of the performance.

West End girl: Jodie is no stranger to performing and it showed in her dance to Word Up by Cameo

As part of her show she went over to the judges panel to dance energetically in front of them.

Following her performance Arlene said she had seen a lot of dancers but 'none sexier than you in your cod piece'

While Greg, who was wearing a mustache for the performance made a reference to the light up red nose on her crotch, cheekily saying : 'Mine does that without having a light on it.'

Dummy: Ventriloquist Nina Conti hit the stage with a range of dancers dressed as animals

Third up came ventriloquist Nina Conti who's opening sequence featured her monkey dummy trying to persuade her to let him take part in the show.

The pretty star looked great in a safari style outfit with leopard print trim and a headband, as she danced to I Like To Movie it.

She was joined on stage by a range of dancers dressed as various animals and half way through her performance she was joined by her ventriloquist monkey.

Crazy costume: In her performance Nina slipped into an impressive gorilla outfit which made it look like she was in cage

Before she returned on stage in an impressive gorilla outfit which made it look like she was in a cage.

After the performance Greg said: 'That was the best show we've had tonight so far.'

While Lee said: 'I've always been a big fan of Nina' and Arlene added: 'I have to crown you queen of the jungle because that was hot.'

Help from friends: Lee Nelson was joined on stage by Twist and Pulse who appeared on Britain's Got Talent

Up next came funnyman Lee Nelson who is of course making his second appearance on the show after first competing back in 2011.

But this time his got a bit of extra help as he is joined by Britain’s Got Talent duo Twist and Pulse.

Ahead of his performance he took a pop at sob stories which appear on shows like X Factor saying 'last week all my friends and family died.'

Stripping: Lee took off his clothes to reveal a leotard underneath which showed off his chest

He began by stripping off his clothes to reveal a leotard underneath and then he commenced with a rather impressive ballet sequence.

The stage was then invaded by a crew of hip hop dancers who challenged him and Twist and Pulse to a dance off.

Afterwards judge Lee said: 'I genuinely think Lee is the Cristiano Ronaldo of dancing- he'll use any excuse to get his top off.'

Bright and beautiful: Host for the evening Alex Jones wore a bright dress which worked well for the jovial tone of the evening

He also mocked the socks the funnyman wore down his leggings, saying that an Action man somewhere was missing his socks.

Arlene: 'Now let's bow down, First of all your ballet was amazing. Must ballet dancers can't get down and dirty but you can get down and dirty.'

At this point Lee cheekily interrupted saying: 'It's got a bit bigger now.'

Amazed: Greg James couldn't quite get over Vanessa's performance

Last week saw Coronation Street star 
Antony Cotton wow with his impressive tap-dancing skills, which resulted
in her securing a place in final.

Canadian funny lady Katherine Ryan won her place with her hilarious take on Nicki Minaj’s assets.

Donations made during the show will help those living unimaginably tough lives both in the UK and Africa.
