Gareth Southgate has urged his players not to make the same mistake as Ben Flower and let indiscipline ruin their chances of reaching Euro 2015.

Southgate has made a point of telling his young squad since they arrived in Vinkovci about the perils of losing their cool in what will be an intense atmosphere and he has used the example of the Wigan prop Flower, who was sent off for punching St Helens' Lance Hohaia in the Grand Final at Old Trafford on Saturday night.

England are braced for Croatia using intimidatory tactics in the second leg, which they trail 2-1, and Southgate does not want to see indiscipline ruin all the good work they have done to get into this position over the last 13 months.

Southgate said: 'We can't afford to get drawn into any of that. The Rugby League on Saturday was a classic example why.

'You have to rise to the challenge physically – we are not here to be pushed over – but you have to keep a cool head.

'We have walked into this town to do a job and that has to remain our priority over everything else.

'Whatever happens in the game we have to make sure we are capable of dealing with it with 11 players on the pitch.'
