Rescue effort: Firefighters began digging quickly with their hands and tools, but were not able to pull the man out until 15 minutes later

The Ventura County Star reported that Mr Sang, who was originally from Seoul, South Korea,  has been in the U.S. for about five years.

The group had spent the day in the area while visiting from the Santa Clarita-based Christian school.

The department’s battalion chief, Darwin Base, told the paper that Mr Sang was trying to take a picture from inside the hole.

Location: Oxnard is about 60 miles west of Los Angeles, and 180 miles away from San Diego

The fire department said the emergency call came in at 4:50pm and rescue crews arrived by 4:54.

Firefighters began digging quickly with their hands and tools, but were not able to pull the Mr Sang out until 15 minutes later.

CPR was performed on the man as he was taken to Ventura County Medical Center, but he was pronounced dead at the hospital.

Mr Sang's name and Korean hometown were originally not released because his relatives have not yet been notified of his death.

The Star reported that lifeguards usually caution people not to dig holes on the beach, but no lifeguards were present on the part of the beach where the accident occurred.

Base, the battalion chief, told the paper that digging large pits in the sand can be dangerous, and 'it's something people really need to know about.'
