A woman has been left blinded after she was exposed to pigeon droppings.

Erica Richards was blinded after living in a house which had a large amount of pigeon feces in its attic.

The 24-year-old developed cryptococcal meningitis, which is a potentially fatal swelling of membranes surrounding the brain.

It is caused by the fungus which lives in the guts of birds, such as pigeons and chickens.

However, if can be breathed in by people if they become exposed to pigeon droppings.

Speaking to CBCNews, Ms Richards said her symptoms included severe migraines, vomiting and loss of appetite.

She added: 'And then I started having double vision, quadruple vision, then seizures. And then I ended up in hospital.'

Kevin Forward, an infectious disease specialist, said: 'Move to avoid being in a situation where there are a lot of pigeon droppings, particularly if you're disturbing them, cleaning them up, sweeping them.'

Grim: Erica Richards' illness was caused by the fungus which lives in the guts of birds, such as pigeons and chickens

Despite being found in large numbers in 
most towns and cities, pigeons are known to carry diseases such as 
Chlamydia and Salmonella.

Last year, Fredericton added pigeons 
to its animal control bylaw. It now means property owners are banned 
from spreading feed or anything which could attract them.

Ms Richards now hopes to go on to study law.
