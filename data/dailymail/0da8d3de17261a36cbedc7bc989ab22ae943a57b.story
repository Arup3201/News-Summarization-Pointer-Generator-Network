Cigarettes will be sold in white packets from May 2015

Labour accused David Cameron of performing a U-turn on a U-turn after ministers dramatically revived the prospect of forcing manufacturers to sell cigarettes in plain packaging.

The Prime Minister caused fury in July when he appeared to kill off earlier plans to impose plain packaging, saying further evidence was needed to show whether it would be effective.

But in a surprise move, public health minister Jane Ellison yesterday announced that eminent paediatrician Sir Cyril Chantler has been asked to carry out a rapid review of the evidence by March – meaning plain packs could be brought in by the time of the 2015 election.

The change of heart was warmly welcomed by health campaigners, but tobacco companies said a ban would have no impact on legal smoking levels and would lead to an increase in smuggling and counterfeit products.

In the Commons, Miss Ellison said the Government had ordered the review in response to evidence emerging from Australia, which last year became the first country to introduce plain packaging.

She said standardised packages would be brought in if ‘we are satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to proceed, including public health benefit’.

The options would then be considered including packs having a uniform colour or using graphic images of smoking-related diseases.

Miss Ellison insisted that the Government had made clear in July that it was simply taking a ‘pause’, following a public consultation in 2012, to consider the evidence from Australia.

But Shadow health minister Luciana Berger said ministers had been forced to act by the prospect of a ‘humiliating’ defeat in the House of Lords on an amendment to the Children and Families Bill tabled by a cross-party group of peers.

‘Only a Government as shambolic as this one could now be U-turning on a U-turn,’ she said.

‘The minister says we need another review but the Government have already had a review and the evidence is clear for all to see. Standardised packaging makes cigarettes less attractive to young people. We should be legislating now, not delaying.’

Some Conservative MPs accused the Government of caving in to the ‘nanny state brigade’.

Tory backbencher Philip Davies said: ‘What we expect from Conservative ministers, who believe in individual freedom and individual responsibility, is to stand up to the health zealots and nanny state brigade who would ban everything and have everything in plain packaging if they could.’

Yesterday, Mr Cameron’s official spokesman denied the change of heart was a ‘U-turn’.

‘What the Government said in the summer was that we would keep this under review, that we would be looking at the emerging evidence – and that’s exactly what the review we’ve announced will do,’ he said.

Last night Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK, praised the Government for ‘great leadership’ and said the move would save thousands of lives.

He added: ‘Stopping cigarettes being marketed to children as a glamorous and desirable accessory is one of the greatest gifts we can give the next generation.

‘Tobacco is a unique product. It is the only consumable that, when used in the way the manufacturer intends, kills half of its users.’

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday admitted that he was an underage smoker who illegally bought cigarettes. He told listeners to his LBC radio phone-in show that his early take-up of smoking was a result of peer pressure.

He added: ‘It was all the boys and girls in my year [who] were smoking.’
