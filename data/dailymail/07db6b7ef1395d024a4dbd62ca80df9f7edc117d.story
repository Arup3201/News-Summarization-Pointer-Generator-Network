A fashion model has filed a $1 million lawsuit against a New York restaurant, claiming a stone that was in a salad she ate three years ago continues to affect her career.

Carolina Rommel claims to have bitten into a rock that somehow got in her meal at popular Manhattan eatery Public while dining there in October 2011.

It caused two of her teeth to crack and 'abnormal swelling' to her face, according to The New York Daily News.

Rommel - who has appeared in campaigns for Abercrombie and Fitch, Macy's and Levi's - claims to have missed out on modeling work as a result and has had to have numerous painful procedures.

Damage to her career: Carolina Rommel, who lists her age as 27 but public records say is 34, claims that a rock in her salad at Manhattan restaurant Public caused her two cracked teeth and abnormal swelling to her face

Scene: Public restaurant is a trendy modern American eatery located in Manhattan's Nolita neighborhood 

Rommel's lawyer, James McCarney, said the stone was in a warm lentil salad.

'As a high fashion model, plaintiff's physical appearance is essential to her ability to work,' the Manhattan Supreme Court says.

However Rommel's Instagram account shows numerous snaps of her modeling shoots.

McCarney said that waiters apologized to Rommel and offered compensation.

However they never followed through.

The suit has asked for unspecified damages.

On the job: Rommel claims the incident caused her work. Her Instagram and Facebook are full of model shoots

Unspecified damages: The lawsuit has not listed how much compensation Rommel is seeking

However McCarney said 'this could run into seven figures'.

Public is located on Elizabeth St in Nolita.

According to AOL, the restaurant's owner questions the 2011 incident, saying it's unclear whether Rommel bit into a rock or a really hard lentil.

In December, a customer at sandwich chain Pret A Manger, also in Manhattan, came across a dead frog in her salad.

Popular: The model has worked for the likes of Abercrombie and Fitch and Levi's
