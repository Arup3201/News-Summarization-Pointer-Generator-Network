Where is she? Mother-of-two Jennifer Huston, 38, vanished as she ran errands in Oregon on July 24, but a new sighting placed her in Washington on Thursday

An emotional Kallen Huston begged for help and any information about his missing wife Jennifer Houston today, hours after local officials called off their search for the mother-of-two.

Kallen said he believed finding his wife's Lexus would be the key to finding her.

'We really need to find her car,” he said, saying there is a 'soccer 
ball-sized U-shaped crack' identifying the window.

'Jennifer,' he said, addressing her directly, 'if you could 
see this or hear this, I love you. You have a ton of support from the 
community. If you can come home, please do. The boys need you. I need 
you. I love you.

'We’ll never stop looking for you.”

Huston, from Dundee, Oregon, 
was captured by surveillance cameras taking out cash at a bank, filling 
up her car with gas and then buying snacks and sleeping pills at a Rite 
Aid on July 24.

But the 
married mom-of-two has not been seen since. Her cell phone stopped 
working minutes after she was seen at the gas station and she has not 
used her credit cards in the past week.

Local police called off their search on Friday with one final aerial search across rural roads in the area.

They also visited the San Juan Islands where the family used to visit but made no progress.

'After [Friday's] flight, the Yamhill County Sheriff's Office will have covered all rural areas of Yamhill County and no further search efforts are planned for Yamhill County,' a spokesperson for the sheriff's office said.

'If additional information arises, search efforts will be resumed as necessary.'

The 40-year-old's family immediately held a press conference to make clear their search continues.

A clearly emotional Mr Huston flanked by fellow members of her family said he keeps calling his wife's cell phone even though it's been turned off on the hope someone might finally answer, KOIN reported.As to questions surrounding her final known purchases, a Gatorade, trail mix, and sleeping aids, her husband said they were not a cause for alarm - the sports drink was because it was a hot day, the trail mix was something they had in the house often, and the pills could be attributed to a headache she'd been suffering from for three days.

He went on to call the disappearance 'completely out of character for her. She loves me, She loves the boys.'

Captain Jeff Kosmicki of the Newberg-Dundee Police Department said her car, a 1999 dark green Lexus LX 470 SUV, would be able to travel 300 to 350 miles after she filled up the tank.

She was filmed at a Circle K gas station around 6.20pm last Thursday.

Mr Huston, who has passed a polygraph test, told investigators his wife had left to run errands and had been complaining of a headache for several days before she went out but said nothing else was out of the ordinary. related]

Mrs Huston was a stay-at-home mother 
to her two sons, aged two and six. Her husband previously said he'd told
 them she was on vacation because he couldn't bear to tell them the 
truth.

He also expressed
 his fears that she might be 'in a ditch somewhere' after driving her 
car off the road and urged motorists to look out for his wife.

Mr Huston has said that his wife complained of headaches three days before disappearing, but she hadn't seen a doctor. At a press conference on Monday, he said he feared she'd crashed her car

'I ask that anybody helping us, 
regardless of the area they are in, look off to the left and off to the 
side of the highways,' he said.

'This is totally unlike her. She's a 
devoted mother. She’s just a very good person, and for her to do 
something like this is completely out of the norm.'

She was last seen wearing black and pink Nike shoes and black yoga pants.

Mrs Huston's mobile phone has been switched off since her disappearance on Thursday. Her family has created a Facebook page to share photographs and information
