The sight 
of Andrew Flintoff on one knee with arms spread wide at Lord’s and then
 standing in triumph after running out Ricky Ponting at The Oval are 
iconic Ashes images.

Now,
 against all the odds, the man they call Freddie is going to be back in professional cricket, five long years after that triumphant swansong.

Iconic: Andrew Flintoff celebrates dismissal of Peter Siddle at Lord's in the 2009 Ashes series

Lancashire’s
 confirmation on Friday that Flintoff, now 36, will play Twenty20 
cricket this summer — probably starting with next Friday’s Roses match —
 is an extraordinary development in the eventful life of a highly 
significant cricketer.

Anyone who
 could even have suggested that he would be able to play at county level
 again when he hobbled off into the south London sunset that fabled day 
at The Oval in 2009 would have been laughed at, not least by Flintoff 
himself.

That he is physically fit enough and seemingly free of the 
chronic knee and ankle problems that so ravaged his England career is to
 his credit. There is no doubt that Flintoff will put thousands on the 
gate wherever he plays.

His
 return is a huge boost for the revamped NatWest T20 Blast and to the 
domestic game at a time when English cricket is at its lowest ebb after 
an Ashes whitewash, something that Flintoff knows all about from being 
captain in 2006-07.

‘It is 
something that I never thought would happen,’ admitted Flintoff. ‘But 
after training with the squad over the past few months I’m really happy 
they have invited me to play. I have worked really hard to get back to 
my fittest and I hope we have a successful summer. I’m just glad I can 
be part of it.’

It
 is, of course, wise to be cautious about a cricketer who had so many 
injury problems and Flintoff needs to come through a club game for St 
Annes this weekend and a  second-team match next Thursday before he is 
fully ready.

Famous face: Andrew Flintoff will make his comeback to cricket for Lancashire in the T20 Blast

Putting his back into it: Flintoff will play a 2nd XI game for Lancashire next week and will then play in the T20s

Yet a cricketer who is clearly fitter 
and leaner now than in his prime, thanks  perhaps to his excursion into 
boxing as part of his diverse cricketing after-life, has worked hard to 
be ready for this. Nothing seems likely to stop him now.

Not many 
sporting stars have the opportunity to go out on top, as Flintoff truly 
did five years ago, and there will be those who will be keeping their 
fingers crossed that this comeback does not end in tears.Flintoff 
has clearly missed the game and would love his children to see him play.
 It is that motivation which has led to this, even though a twisted 
ankle two weeks ago kept his comeback on ice — quite literally.

The 
moment when MCC told him they did not want him to play in their 
star-studded bicentenary game at Lord’s in July, as revealed by Charles 
Sale in Sportsmail, crystalised  Flintoff’s determination to come back.

‘John
 Stephenson from MCC phoned me and I thought it was to tell me where to 
turn up and who else would be in the side,’ said Flintoff in a BBC Radio
 5 Live interview. ‘My kids were in the car and he told me he didn’t 
want me. He said they had Brian Lara and all these other people. I 
thought.

The return: Lancashire have announced Flintoff's return

'They’re all 10 years older than me and they haven’t played for
 years”. I saw my kids’ faces and it was the first time they’d seen 
their dad told he couldn’t do something. They said, “Never mind, there 
will be other games” and I thought, “There will be, actually”.

‘I 
was getting knocked back and wanting to play, practising and realising 
“I can still do this”. And there is unfinished business from when I 
retired. I’d sooner have a go and have it not come off than sit at home 
for the rest of my days thinking, “I should have tried it, I should have
 had a go”. I don’t live my life like that.’

Flintoff, whose 
friendship with Lancashire captain and interim coach Glen Chapple 
facilitated the move, admitted his return to the nets has not been pain 
free. ‘When I’m bowling it still hurts a bit,’ he said. ‘But I’m loving 
running in and if I can take that into a game I might be dangerous.

‘I
 don’t want this to be one year. You see Brad Hogg playing in the Big 
Bash, Brad Hodge is playing for Australia at 39 and  Glen Chapple is 40 
and still charging in for Lancashire in four-day games.’

It would be
 stretching a point to believe Flintoff could again play in Championship
 cricket or, as will inevitably be speculated, for England in Twenty20. 
Yet he is clearly serious about doing himself justice for Lancashire and
 that must surely be a good thing for both him and his county. We wish 
him well.
