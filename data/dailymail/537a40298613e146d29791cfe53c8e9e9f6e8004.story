The Indian husband who stabbed to death an American social worker admitted to a previous killing during a marital spat, the woman's father is now claiming.

Erin Willinger, 35, a yoga teacher and psychologist from New York, was found Thursday dumped on the side of a road in Agra, India, with multiple stab wounds to her face and body.

Her husband, 32-year-old Bunty Sharma, returned to their home after killing and committed suicide by blowing himself up, according to local media.

Andrew Willinger claimed to ABC News his daughter fled the apartment she shared with Sharma in the city known for the famous Taj Mahal after he admitted to previously being imprisoned for killing a friend.

Loss: Erin Willinger, from New York, was killed by her Indian husband in India on Thursday evening

Tragic: Willinger had only moved to Agra, India in July and met Bunty Sharma, left, whom she married in October. After killing her on Thursday, he returned to their home and blew himself up

'He tells her this story thinking that she would understand. She was appalled and she basically left within weeks of their wedding,' said the grieving father.

He also refuted local reports that they accused each other of lying about previous 
marriages, saying she knew of his previous wife because she was the mother of his six-year-old son. The previous wife died of an illness, he added.

The father said his daughter was romantically with Sharma, but that the marriage was more of an effort to be accepted by the community than anything else - it was also against his wishes.

'She gets the idea that getting married would both get to be part of the community and be part of the family,' Andrew Willinger told ABC. 'It led to doing something official in court against my strong objection, but she just was determined.'

Willinger had visited Agra - which is about 120 miles south of New Delhi - with a group of Americans in July and chose to stay after telling the Indo-Asian News Service she wanted to help make the city worthy of 'such a beautiful monument as the Taj Mahal'.

After arriving in the city, she met Sharma, a cab driver, and the pair married quickly - celebrating on a rooftop restaurant in front of the Taj Mahal. Officials records note they married on October 11.

But within weeks, their marriage began to crumble and by December, they started living separately.

Both accused the other of hiding previous marriages and Willinger, who went by the alias Kiran Sharma and also uses the name Erin White, accused her new husband of greed, infidelity and cruelty, the Hindustan Times initially reported.

White approached the Agra Police's 
Mediation Cell for Family Matters in January, asking for help and the 
couple was put in touch with a counselor, who encouraged them to start 
living together again, something her father says she never wanted to do.

Suicide: Neighbors rushed to save Sharma after hearing an explosion in his apartment but they found his charred body (center, pixelated) after he apparently lit cooking gas to kill himself

Motive: Bundy allegedly killed her amid arguments over infidelity and lies about their previous marriages

The terrified woman recently filed divorce papers, according to her father, and had only gone to the counselor thinking it was part of the dissolution process. She had hoped to remain friends though, he said.

'As far as she told me in conversation, that was required and she never intended for it to reconcile the marriage,' Andrew Willinger told ABC. 'She hoped there could be something amicable [between them].'

His daughter remained in touch with Sharma's young son, often visiting the boy to make sure he was doing well, Andrew Willinger added.

The last visit appears to have come on Thursday evening, when Sharma reportedly drove Willinger to a quieter section of the city and stabbed her to death in his 
taxi cab.

He then is said to have tossed her body in bushes along the road, the Hindustan Times reported.

The previously convicted murderer then returned home and spent his final moments locked in a second floor room.

Local residents then said they heard a loud explosion and saw flames erupting from the room. When they rushed inside to rescue him, they found his charred body on the floor.

Authorities believe Sharma sparked the blast by igniting gas he had released from a cooking gas cylinder in the apartment.

Police soon recovered the blood-stained knife and sent the bodies for autopsies, OneIndia reported.

New life: Willinger, pictured with a friend, said she wanted to stay in Agra 'as long as her body permits'

The union home ministry and the American embassy in New Delhi have been informed.

A State Department official confirmed Willinger's death.

'We offer our condolences to her family and loved ones on their loss,' the official told MailOnline.

'We are in contact with her family and are providing all appropriate consular assistance. Out of respect for the privacy of those affected, we decline further comment.'

Before her death, Willinger had revealed that she was deeply in love with Indian culture and wanted to improve civic conditions in Agra.

On the day she was killed, she 
addressed a press conference to promote her campaign 'Agra Sunder Hai', 
and several local NGOs pledged support to her.

She hoped to help Agra with improving its water, plastic waste and garbage disposal.

Her father told ABC that her humanitarian efforts were only just recently starting to gain momentum.

'I think the tragedy to me -- besides the personal one -- is that things were just really getting started.

'She started to see things were happening,' he added. 'She thought she was safe because she had friends in the community.'

Last
 September, she spoke with the Indo-Asian News Service under the name Erin White.

She revealed her desire 
to stay and help the city, although she had only planned to visit to 
help feed leprosy sufferers near the Taj Mahal, and even spoke of wanting to stay in Agra until '60 or maybe more - as long as the body permits'.

'This city needs a push,' she said. 'The city is dirty and no one wants to stay back here for a night. You have to teach people to be conscious of hygiene, health and sensibilities of others. You have to build trust and reach out.'

She spoke of taking money from the rich to give resources to the poor, and said she hoped to get actors and other celebrities on board to help make programs more attractive.

And she was confident that her idea was going to be a success.

'I am talking with so many [students, businessmen and professionals] and they all agree that the time for change has indeed come,' she said.

'You need role models. A democratic society needs inspiring heroes to move ahead. You need success stories to diffuse the clouds of negativity all around.'

She sadly never got to fulfill that mission.
