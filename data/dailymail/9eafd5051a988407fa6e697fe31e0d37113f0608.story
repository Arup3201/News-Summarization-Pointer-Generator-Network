Killer robots may seem like a dramatic term taken straight from a science fiction film such as The Terminator, but the technology is very real.

And the threat it poses is so serious, the United Nations is holding a summit this week to debate the future of Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWS).

Discussions will include the rise of technological developments, the legal challenges LAWS cause, as well as the ethical and sociological implications.

Reports earlier this week claimed the U.S. military is seeking to build a robot capable of moral reasoning with a $7.5 million grant from the Office of Naval Research.

The grant, given over five years to researchers from Tufts, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Brown, Yale and Georgetown, will be used to explore how to build an autonomous robot with a sense of right and wrong.

'Even though today’s unmanned systems are ‘dumb’ in comparison to a human counterpart, strides are being made quickly to incorporate more automation at a faster pace than we’ve seen before,' said Paul Bello, director of the cognitive science program at the Office of Naval Research.

But, research from University of Wisconsin-Madison has found robots are incpable of having feelings and developing rational thinking.

Using mathematical model of how our brains create consciousness, they claim emotional machines will never exist.

This is because computers can't handle any process that completely integrates information, so they cannot be conscious and capable of feeling, an expert claimed.

Member states and officials will also focus on the deployment of autonomous weapons, and the possible impact on military operations.

The conference is called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) Meeting of Experts on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems.

The purpose of the convention is to ban or restrict the use of specific types of weapons that 'are considered to cause unnecessary or unjustifiable suffering to combatants or to affect civilians indiscriminately.'

Michael Møller, Acting Director-General of the United Nations Office at Geneva said to conference members 'have the opportunity to take pre-emptive action and ensure that the ultimate decision to end life remains firmly under human control.’

Ambassador Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel of France, who is chairing the four-day meeting, added: ‘Lethal autonomous weapons systems are a challenging emerging issue on the disarmament agenda right now.’

The outcomes of the Geneva discussions will be submitted to the formal conference of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons in November 2014, where states will discuss possible next steps on autonomous weapons.

The discussions are supported by a report issued earlier this week by the Human Rights Watch.

It claims killer robots ‘jeopardise basic human rights, whether used in wartime or for law enforcement’ and is demanding they are kept out of policing.

This follows comments made by the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in his report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict issued in November 2013.

He said important questions have been raised as to the ability of such systems to operate in accordance with international humanitarian and human rights law.

‘Although autonomous weapons systems have not yet been deployed and the extent of their development as a military technology remains unclear, discussion of such questions must begin immediately and not once the technology has been developed and proliferated,’ said Ki-Moon.

While noting the Meeting of Experts was only a first step towards addressing lethal autonomous weapons, Acting Director-General Møeller urged the delegates gathered in Geneva to take bold action.

‘All too often international law only responds to atrocities and suffering once it has happened,' Mr. Moeller said and noted that Geneva has had ‘a historical record that is second to none for achieving results in disarmament and international humanitarian law negotiations.’
