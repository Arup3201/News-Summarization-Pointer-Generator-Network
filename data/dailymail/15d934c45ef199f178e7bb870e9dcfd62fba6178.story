Dover Athletic chairman Jim Parmenter has slammed Crystal Palace boss Alan Pardew for being 'rude and arrogant' following the Eagles' 4-0 FA Cup win at Crabble on Sunday afternoon.

Pardew took charge of the south London side for the first time as they secured a comprehensive victory at the home of the Conference opposition, but the 53-year-old left a bitter taste in the mouths of Dover.

The Palace boss was believed to be incensed at the accessibility to the ground, with Pardew claiming it took his side 20 minutes to walk 150 yards up the Crabble slope from the coach drop-off point in Lewisham Road.

When the former Newcastle boss eventually got into the ground he allegedly remarked: 'It's f***ing ridiculous.' 

And that didn't go down well with the Whites' chairman, who has since gone on the record to criticise Pardew.

Parmenter told The Sun: 'It is complete arrogance for him to expect us to make special arrangements just because it's him.

'I don't know what Pardew was doing for 20 minutes. You can crawl up there on all fours in a couple of minutes. He was also very rude to staff.'
