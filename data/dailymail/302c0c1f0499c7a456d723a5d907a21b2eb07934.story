Naomi Laver (with husband Aaron) has a condition which means her joints dislocate on a daily basis, meaning she has to force them back into place

A woman dubbed 'sparrow legs' has to piece her body back together each day because a rare condition means her joints constantly dislocate.

As a child, Naomi Laver's legs would bend backwards, she would be told off for not standing up properly and fell victim to the playground bullies making fun of her condition.

For years doctors dismissed her mother's complaints, passing it off as growing pains.

But at the age of 16, after being referred to an orthopaedic consultant, Ms Laver was diagnosed with Benign Joint Hypermobility Syndrome.

The rare disorder causes joint laxity, which results in limbs bending the wrong way leaving joints prone to dislocation.

After repeated visits to the doctors, Ms Laver's condition deteriorated when her knees started dislocating.

The 22-year-old, said: ‘At first it was around once a week.  

'But it got worse and soon my knees were dislocating every day and I needed crutches.  

‘Each time they’d make a loud clicking noise. I’d be at school or out and about.   

‘At first I was scared but I learned to pop my joints back into place. Only sometimes I couldn’t do it and I’d end up in hospital.

‘One time I was out in town with friends and it happened. Everyone laughed, it was mortifying.’ 

Ms Laver, from Barton-Upon-Humber in Lincolnshire, refused to leave the house for fear of being mocked.

Finally at the age of 16 she was referred to an orthopaedic consultant.

Tests followed, including X-rays, reflex and mobility tests, to assess joint laxity.

It was then specialists diagnosed Ms Laver with the rare syndrome. The condition is often hereditary and tends to affect more women than men.

Ms Laver, said: ‘I was told there was nothing they could do, I’d have to live with it.

‘But at least it was a diagnosis, I hadn’t imagined it.’

As time wore on her condition grew worse. When she was 18, Ms Laver had an operation on one of her knees to try and fix the joint, but surgery did not work.

The 22-year-old has suffered chronic pain as a result of her bendy legs since she was a child. Her condition prompted bullies to call her 'sparrow legs'

Joint hypermobility means some or all of a person's joints have an unusually large range of movement.

People with hypermobility are particularly supple and able to move their limbs into positions others find impossible.

Many people with hypermobile joints do not have any problems or need treatment. However, joint hypermobility can sometimes cause unpleasant symptoms, such as:

It can cause extreme tiredness and long-term pain. The condition is often hereditary, and is linked to changes in a protein called collagen.

Collagen is found throughout the body – for example, in skin and ligaments.

If collagen is weaker than it should be, tissues in the body will be fragile. This can make ligaments and joints particularly loose and stretchy.

There are estimates that up to 3 in 10 people may be affected to some degree.

It was then, the condition began to affect other parts of Ms Laver's body.

‘I started dislocating all my joints, my shoulders, elbows, ankles, toes, hands, even my jaw,' Ms Laver said.

'It would happen several times a day. I didn’t know from one moment to the next which part of me would pop out of place.

‘Every time I moved something would go - and with it came a loud clicking sound.

‘I’d often wake in the morning and have to put various parts of myself back together again.

‘The pain was intense. I was prescribed different painkillers but I was in agony.’

Walking became difficult, leaving Ms Laver almost house bound.

‘With the body of a 100-year-old, what future did I have? By last summer I even needed a wheelchair to get around,' she said.

It was around the same time, that she met Aaron, 21, through a friend.

‘He was loving, caring, my condition didn’t faze him,' said Naomi.

‘We grew close, fell in love. And after a few months he asked me if I’d marry him.’

She said yes - but vowed not to go down the aisle in her wheelchair.

‘Mustering
 all my strength, and ignoring the loud clicking under my wedding dress, I
 made it up the aisle to where Aaron was waiting,' she said.

‘It was the happiest moment of my life. And I held it together until my legs gave way at the reception.

‘But
 each day is still a struggle, my legs are getting bendier by the day 
and I have to choose what I want to dislocate - my legs by walking a few
 steps or my arms by using my wheelchair.  

'And I have to put myself back together again when I wake in the mornings.'

Ms
 Laver has just been referred to a hospital in Bath for specialist 
physiotherapy treatment once a month which doctors are confident will 
help with her condition by strengthening surrounding muscles to ease 
pressure on her joints.
