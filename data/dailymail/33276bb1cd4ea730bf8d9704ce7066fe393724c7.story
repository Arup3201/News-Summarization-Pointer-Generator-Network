A New York hospital is banning electronic cigarettes after a patient on oxygen was burned by a fire that erupted while she was puffing on one of the devices.

Syracuse Fire Department investigator Joe Galloway tells The Post-Standard the exact cause of last month's fire at St. Joseph's Hospital Health Center has not yet been determined.

But he says the patient had a battery-powered e-cigarette, which uses a heating element to vaporize nicotine.

The patient had an e-cigarette in her mouth and was using oxygen when the fire started.

 Leonard, a St. Joe's patient safety representative, was in the 
patient's first-floor room helping her roommate when he heard a loud pop
 and saw flames through a privacy curtain separating the patients' beds.

He
 saw flames around the patient's nose and fire shooting out of the end 
of a hose connected to an oxygen outlet in the wall. The flames were put
 out in less than a minute.

Oxygen itself is not flammable. But medical oxygen increases oxygen levels of normal air, making it easier for fires to ignite.

Stubbed out: St. Joseph's officials have told patients e-cigarette use is not allowed. The hospital also prohibits tobacco use inside its buildings or outdoors on its campus

Jennie
 DeLee, a registered nurse at St. Joe's, heard yelling and went into the
 room where the fire occurred. 'The patient was standing at the side of 
the bed,' she told Syracuse.com 'I just saw black soot and charred skin.
 She was in shock.'

Hospital officials said the quick response of
 staff prevented what could have been a catastrophe and more serious 
injury to the patient.

Hospital officials have not identified the patient. They say she suffered first- and second-degree burns across her face, but is home and doing well.

Since the fire, St. Joseph's officials have told patients they aren't allowed to use e-cigarettes. The hospital also prohibits tobacco use on its campus.

The fire investigation at St. Joe's comes at a time when there is growing concern nationally about the safety of e-cigarettes which are not regulated by the government and have been linked to poisonings and fires.

The U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationÂ  has received at least four reports of e-cigarettes causing fires.

There is no government regulation of e-cigarettes. The FDA is expected to issue proposed rules governing e-cigarettes soon.
