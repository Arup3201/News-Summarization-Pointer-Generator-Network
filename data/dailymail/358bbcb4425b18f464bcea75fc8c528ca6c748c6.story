Most newlyweds dream of a honeymoon in the Seychelles or a five-star trip to Paris.

But, for one couple who met in a Travelodge, a stay in a £53 a night room at the budget hotel chain was the perfect romantic getaway.

Not that they had to travel far though - the hotel was just 25 miles from their home.

Budget celebration: Mike and Michelle - who met at a Travelodge in 2011 - got married last Thursday

Mike Sampson, 50, and Michelle Green, 47, have stayed at 14 different lodges around Britain on romantic weekends away.

And they are such huge fans, they decided to shun a five-star trip abroad in favour of a stay at the Travelodge Newquay Seafront hotel, in Cornwall.

The couple married at Falmouth Register Office on Thursday before making the 40-minute drive to their £53 a night room.

They stayed for one night in a sea-view room, and treated themselves to the hotel's all-you-can-eat buffet breakfast.

Builder Mike met hospital secretary Michelle at a Travelodge in Birmingham in February 2011, when they were both away on business.

Both have been married before and Michelle has three children from her previous relationship.

They exchanged numbers while chatting over breakfast and remained in contact when they both left.

Mike, who has two children from a previous marriage, said: 'Michelle and I always stay at a Travelodge when we go away on short breaks.

'We know what to expect from one of their hotels and have become quite comfortable staying there.

'When we decided to marry there was no way we were going to book anywhere else for our honeymoon.'

'We could have afforded to go to the Seychelles or Paris if we wanted to but it didn't appeal to us.

'In fact, Michelle could think of nothing worse than Paris.

'I appreciate a Travelodge may not seem like the most romantic place for a honeymoon, but it is perfect for us."

He said their favourite Travelodge is at Exeter services on the M5 because it has a 'small family feel to it'.

Mike added: 'It is beside a motorway, so we certainly weren't attracted to the view.'

The couple - who both spent their first honeymoons in Majorca - now live together in Mawnan Smith, near Falmouth, Cornwall.

Shakila Ahmed, from Travelodge, said: 'We would like to congratulate Mr and Mrs Sampson on their wedding and to wish them the very best of luck for the future.

'We were delighted to hear that Travelodge has played such an instrumental part in bringing this couple together and has remained a key element throughout their courtship, even including the honeymoon.

'Our hotel team were very excited that the Sampsons choose their hotel for their honeymoon and added some extra touches to the couple's room to make their romantic stay extra special.'
