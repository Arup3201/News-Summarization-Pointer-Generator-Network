He formally killed off his showbiz persona after a failed TV comeback. 

These days Michael Barrymore is Michael Parker, garden centre worker.

The 60-year-old – once one of Britain’s top entertainers – has reverted to using his real name and helps out stacking shelves and shifting sacks of compost.

He said: ‘I don’t get paid for it. I help out because I enjoy gardening. People come over and wish me well. Sometimes I walk around with them to show them the plants.’

The former TV star, who works three days a week at Tomlins  in Brentwood, Essex, added:  ‘I stack the shelves and often I’m wheeling around heavy sacks  of compost.’

Barrymore’s programmes, including Strike It Lucky and My Kind Of People, were watched weekly by millions in the Eighties and Nineties.

But his star crashed to earth in 2001, when the body of Stuart Lubbock, 31, was found in his swimming pool during a party.

The day after his death, Barrymore checked into the Marchwood Priory in Southampton, commonly used by celebrities with addictions and depression.

A police investigation led to no charges and an inquest recorded an open verdict, but Barrymore never recovered from the affair and in 2003 he was axed by ITV.

In May 2004 he filed for bankruptcy after receiving a ‘surprise’ tax bill, reported to be in the region of £1.4million.

The entertainer, who once signed a £2million deal with ITV, recently said that he finally dropped his stage persona after an unsuccessful comeback attempt when he appeared on Celebrity Big Brother in 2006.

The recovering alcoholic has since admitted he came close to taking his own life.

He said: ‘My real name is Michael Parker – Michael Barrymore is dead. Although I have been a couple of times to the jumping-off point, I didn’t kill myself. If I had, it would have completed the story.

‘I don’t have to do what I’ve been doing since I was eight, which is making people laugh to deflect things. It’s the first time I’ve ever got to know me.’ He blamed ‘a conspiracy’ for destroying his TV career and spoke of his regrets over the way he treated his wife Cheryl following his decision to come out as homosexual in 1995.

He said: ‘I never shy away from the fact that I’m an alcoholic and that I have had my problems, but I’ve never murdered anybody. I’ve never got up in the morning and thought I’ll harm someone.

I’ve just had an extraordinary sequence of events that have been on public display that I’ve had no control over.’

In 2009 it emerged that Barrymore was working as an odd-job man in an Essex garage.
