Migrants waiting in Calais for a passage to Britain have taken to burning the piles of rubbish that fill their makeshift camps amid 'health fears'.

More than 2,500 migrants are thought to live in shanty towns which are strewn with rubbish around Calais, with some taking to burning the refuse that has built up around the camps.

But despite the unsanitary conditions, the French authorities are simply releasing migrants caught trying to enter Britain, allowing them to make fresh attempts to cross the border.

The camps are mainly populated by men hoping to start a new life in Britain, but hundreds of mothers and their children also live in unsanitary conditions in tent villages dotted around the port.

The squalid conditions are no place for young children, but pictures taken in the camp today show young boys and girls are among the migrants waiting for their chance to cross into Britain.

Despite the unclean and rubbish-strewn environment, the number of attempts to cross into Britain has quadrupled in just three years, according to Home Office figures.

Almost 3,000 attempts are made every month, which does not include those who made into Britain undetected. From April to July this year, 11,920 attempts were made to enter the UK. 

Meanwhile it emerged yesterday evening that more than 390,000 immigration cases have been built up by the Home Office – equivalent to the population of Cardiff.

And last night it was revealed that rather than deporting the stowaways back to their home countries, France is simply releasing them to make new attempts at breaching Britain’s borders.

Earlier this week, chief inspector of immigration John Vine said that the number of missing migrants in the UK totalled 89,000.

But the Home Affairs Select Committee said there were a further 304,222 files piled up elsewhere in the system – including asylum seekers and foreign criminals, with a report describing Britain's immigration system as being in 'intensive care'. 

On the backlog, Labour MP Mr Vaz added: ‘Our immigration system has left A&E and has entered intensive care.’ 

A string of explosive investigations by Mr Vine have been delayed for months, with ministers accused of slipping them out on busy days in order to try to bury bad news.

A report revealing citizenship had been granted to illegal immigrants and foreign criminals, including a killer, was issued at 10.30am on a Thursday, preventing MPs from being able to ask an urgent question about it in the Commons because of Parliamentary rules.

The Home Affairs committee said: ‘It is unacceptable for the Home Office to withhold from public view reports produced by the independent chief inspector of immigration and borders for longer than one month without providing a good reason.’ 

Separate figures on immigration attempts, disclosed in response to a Freedom of Information request, show that in the year April 2011 to April 2012 migrants were caught trying to enter Britain 9,632 times. By last year the figure had almost doubled reaching 19,003.

But this year the number has risen sharply. At current rates, more than 35,000 illegal immigrants could have been caught by the end of the year.
