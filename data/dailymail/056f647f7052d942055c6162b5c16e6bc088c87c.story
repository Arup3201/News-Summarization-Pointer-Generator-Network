Last year, the Warwick University ladies rowing team made headlines when their nude charity calendar became the target of criticism from feminist bloggers.

But despite the blogger's best efforts, the fundraiser proved a success and resulted in more than £600 being donated to Macmillan Cancer Support.

Now, the Warwick girls are back with a new calendar and say they won't be told when and where to show off their bodies by feminists.

Unabashed: Hettie (centre) and her fellow rowers haven't been put off by the backlash as these images reveal

'In our opinion, the feminists who 
criticised our calendar for hampering the feminist cause are 
contradicting their own argument.,' explained students Hettie Reed, Frankie Salzano and Sophie Bell - all of whom appear in the new calendar.

'Surely what feminists are seeking to 
achieve is equality for men and women - be it in jobs, pay, opportunities or the impression that society has of them.

'As the men of our club have produced a 
successful [naked] calendar for the past four years, we are more than entitled to 
do the same thing.'

They added: 'As politics students all three of us
would consider ourselves feminists, any woman who wants equality would, 
but we don't think that we are hampering the cause - in fact we think we 
are furthering it.'

In a blog post for the Huffington Post, Layla Haidrani, who describes herself as a commentator on feminist issues, described the initiative as 'tacky' and insisted that the girls were 'victims in the liberation game'.

Charity: Like the 2013 effort, proceeds from this year's calendar will go to support Macmillan Cancer Support

Backlash: Last year's calendar caused controversy after it was criticised by feminist blogger Layla Haidrani

'Groups of women posing semi-naked on a field with sticks doesn't
sound a fundraising initiative for charity, it just sounds tacky,' she wrote.

'Although many argue that it is purely 
for fundraising purposes, in my own university sports team, the majority
of women who participated were not made aware and did not even seek to 
find out which charities were being helped.

'Rather,
they just view it as an opportunity to strip and attempt to gain 
notoriety with friends and family both back home and on campus.

'As
opposed to being liberated by posing semi-naked, they are in fact just 
helping women to be perpetually viewed as sex objects, something to be "bought", "sold" and then tossed away once the Christmas period is over.'

But the Warwick rowers, far from being put off by the backlash, insist that Haidrani was wrong to criticise them and say they received overwhelming support from the general public.

'The controversy last year was a shame 
considering it was all intended for a good cause,' explains Hettie.

'Ultimately, we 
received an overwhelming amount of support with many people sending in 
emails thanking us for supporting such a great charity and sharing 
stories with us about how Macmillan Cancer Support had benefited them.'

Support: The girls raised more than £600 for their chosen charity last year and received many kind messages

High hopes: The girls hope this year's effort will raise more money and that interest will focus on the cause

Like last year's effort, the 2014 
calendar comes in tasteful black and white and features the girls posing
in a variety of rowing-related scenes, including wandering out of the 
boat shed and standing next to a wooden pier with life jackets to cover 
their modesty.

And like its predecessor, proceeds from the £7.99 calendar will also be used to help fund the work of Macmillan Cancer Support - something that Hettie hopes attention will focus on this year.

'This year's calendar is more to do with raising awareness of the amazing work that Macmillan Cancer Support does
and helping them to help more people,' she pleads.

'This is something which shouldn't
be detracted from by a political debate over the feminist cause.'
