Surgery: British hospitals have reported a five-fold increase in labiaplasty in recent years

The debate surrounding labiaplasty has always been a contentious one.

Is surgery to give you a 'designer vagina' a tool for female empowerment or an extreme example of women becoming the victims of an increasingly X-rated world?

With UK hospitals reporting a five-fold increase in patients opting to undergo labia surgery - and some girls as young as 11 expressing interest - a research charity has released an animated film to explain the subject.

In the Wellcome Trust's Centrefold Project, documentary filmmaker Ellie Land focuses on three women who have undergone the surgery.

Each
 woman had a different reason for opting to have the procedure - which 
involves 'neatening-up' the genital area through cutting and stitching -
 and each explains how she felt with the results.

The first interviewee talks about how
 she used to feel like a 'freak' because of her long labia, and that she
 repeatedly dreamed they were a 'long, long scarf' wrapped tightly 
around her neck that everyone was staring and laughing at.

The
 second divulges that her own large labia were not only unlike those of 
other women, but that they affected her sex life because of 'mobility 
issues' and that 'they would get in the way'.

The third woman says she worried her labia were 'long, dark, disgusting, shrivelled-up', and that she was quite embarrassed about it not being 'normal'.

The women talk about spending hours flicking through porn magazines trying to find women with similar labia, but never managing.

One
 woman confesses that although her motivation for the surgery was 
'aesthetic', not a day went by when she didn't think about her vagina 
'in a bad way', and that she didn't look 'the way women were meant to 
look'.

Another says: 'The labia would rub and cause me a lot of pain - sometimes I even had little blisters.'

Land also interviews the women after the procedures, and each explains how the surgery has affected their lives both positively and negatively.

Speaking to MailOnline about her animated film, Land said: 'The focus of the film is to present a balanced view of labiaplasty, while reflecting the anxieties and concerns the women interviewed share about their labia.

'The film comments on some of the cultural factors that could be driving women's anxieties about their genitals, such as advertising, pornography and consumerism.

Some of the interviewed women had physical problems with their genitals and so we find that women's reasons for surgery is a complex issue.'

Labia surgery costs over Â£3,000 if done privately, but 2,000 labiaplasties were carried out by the NHS last year, a fivefold increase on the last five years.

To be eligible for the surgery on the NHS, a woman must have physical reasons which include pain during intercourse, discomfort due to rubbing clothes, rare hormonal disorders causing the labia minora to enlarge and damage done after giving birth.

It is also possible to get a labiaplasty on the NHS in the absence of physical medical problems.

If the size or shape of your labia are causing you real psychological damage - such as depression or self-esteem problems - women can be assessed by a GP to determine the need for labiaplasty and then referred to a gynaecologist.

Speaking to the Huffington Post, consultant gynaecologist Dr Sarah Creighton said she sees patients as young as 11, and is surprised by what she believes is a new phenomenon.

A second film available on 
the Centrefold website which addresses recent research into labia 
surgery.

This film highlights the possible dangers that labia surgery
 could present, because it is unknown what lasting effects the surgery 
may have.
