A Russian shuttle carrying a former Navy Seal who has been honoured for his bravery in Afghanistan has successfully docked with the International Space Station this morning.

The Soyuz capsule carrying astronauts Chris
Cassidy of the United States and Russians Pavel Vinogradov and 
Alexander Misurkin linked up 
with the space station at 2.28am.

It brings the size of the crew at the Russian Rassvet research module, which was located over the 
Pacific Ocean, just off Peru, when the team docked, to six.

Vinogradov, 59, who had been in space in 1997 and 2006, was heard saying on 
NASA TV: 'It's
such a beautiful sight, hard to believe my eyes.'

The incoming crew will spend five months in space before returning to Earth.

The trio who arrived at the space station this morning includes former navy seal Lieutenant
Commander Chris Cassidy  - on his second mission into space.

The 43-year-old served four six-month deployments to 
Afghanistan and two to the Mediterranean as a Navy SEAL. His dedicated 
service earned him two Bronze Stars for leading a nine-day operation at 
the Zharwar Kili cave complex in Afghanistan.

Once the capsule reached the station, the trio had to wait two hours for the pressure to equalize before they were allowed to enter.

'Hey, is anyone home?' joked Vinogradov as he floated into the station. 

Cassidy,
Vinogradov and Misurkin were greeted with cheers and hugs by American 
Tom Mashburn, Russian Roman Romanenko and Canadian Chris Hadfield, who 
have been at the station since December.

The astronauts then had a brief session with Mission Control outside Moscow, talking with friends and relatives.

'You're
such a star! I'm really proud of you!' Misurkin's tearful mother said. 
The 35-year-old Russian is on his first flight into space.

Their mission began with a late-night launch from the Russian-leased Baikonur launch pad in Kazakhstan.

It
was the first time a space crew has taken such a direct route to the 
orbiting lab. Cassidy, Vinogradov and Misurkin are the first crew to 
reach the station after only four orbits instead of the standard 50-hour
flight to reach the station.

The
new maneuver was tested successfully by three Russian Progress cargo 
ships, unmanned versions of the Soyuz used to ferry supplies to the 
space station. Russian cosmonauts have described the two-day approach 
maneuver in the cramped Soyuz as one of the most grueling parts of 
missions.

Vinogradov 
said at a pre-launch news conference that the shorter flight path would 
reduce the crew's fatigue and allow the astronauts to be in top shape 
for the docking.

Cassidy, who lives in 
York, Maine with his wife and their three children, was selected for the
space program by NASA in 2004.

Astronaut training is among the toughest in the world, but Cassidy was more than prepared for it, having already gone through Navy SEAL training.

As a seal he underwent the infamous 'hell week,' in which candidates only sleep four hours over 5 1/2 days while running up to 200 miles and physically training for 20 hours per day.

Cassidy told Universe Today that all training that astronauts - and Navy SEALs - go through is for a very good reason.

'I think just the training that I got in the field, training in the early part of my Navy career, and during my time being an astronaut will all combine together.

'What I know from combat in the Navy, there’s a sort of calmness that comes over people who are well-trained and know what to do. Muscle memory kicks in, and it’s not until after the thing is over that you realize what you went through,' he said.

On the International Space Station, Cassidy will be doing experiments measuring bone mass, which will have applications for people facing osteoporosis.

This is his second mission. In 2009 he was part of a mission to help install and complete components of the Japanese Experiment Module and got to perform three spacewalks.

He follows on the heels of other former SEALs to make it to space, including International Space Station Expedition 1 commander William Shepherd.

The U.S. Navy has shown its support for Cassidy on social media platforms by posting a meme of an astronaut with the wording: ‘Nothing beats an astronaut… except a Navy Seal astronaut.’

The wording is a play on the popular T.V. commercial that Unilever is currently running featuring astronauts, a lifeguard and a fireman, to promote the Axe Apollo body spray for men by Lynx.

The Soyuz TMA-08M lifted off from the Russian-leased Baikonur cosmodrome at 2:43 a.m. Friday local time.

The
new maneuver has been tested successfully by three Russian Progress 
cargo ships, an unmanned version of the Soyuz used to ferry supplies to 
the space station.

Vinogradov joked at a pre-launch news conference at Baikonur that the journey to the station would be so quick that it could allow the crew to even carry ice cream as a present to the three men currently manning the orbiting outpost.

‘It wouldn't melt in such a short time,’ he said.

The shorter flight path also reduces the crew's fatigue and allow astronauts to be in top shape for the docking.

Vinogradov said that it takes about five hours for the human body to start feeling the impact of zero gravity, so the quicker flight would allow the crew to more easily adapt to weightlessness in much roomier space station interiors.

The downside of the accelerated rendezvous is that the crew will have to stay in their spacesuits, which they don hours before the launch, through the entire approach maneuver.

Other Russian cosmonauts in the past have described the two-day approach maneuver in the cramped Soyuz as one of the most grueling parts of missions to the orbiting station.

The spheroid orbiting capsule allows the crew to take off their bulky spacesuits, change into more comfortable clothes and use a toilet, but its interior is extremely confined.

The ship's spartan layout lacks adequate heating and fails to provide an opportunity for the crew to get hot food. It contrasts sharply with the spacious U.S. space shuttle, whose retirement has left Soyuz as the only means to deliver crews to the space outpost.

Russian space officials said the longer approach was necessary at a time when the station was in a lower orbit required for the shuttle flights. After they ended, it was raised from 350 kilometers to 400 kilometers, making a quicker rendezvous possible.

NASA is working on the development of its new generation Orion spacecraft. Orion's first trip is an unmanned mission in 2017, and the first manned mission is set for 2021.
