Two out of every three secondary schools have struggled to recruit enough maths teachers in the past year, an alarming survey suggests.

They also had difficulty finding English and science teachers, with almost half having problems in key subjects.

The findings will add to growing concerns over the supply of teachers, which has been affected by the growing pupil population and the expansion of the School Direct programme.

Two out of every three secondary schools have struggled to recruit enough maths teachers in the past year, an alarming survey suggests (file picture)

School Direct, which involves training on the job, has filled just 61 per cent of the teaching places it was allocated this year. Headteachers say the problem is also exacerbated by large workloads and ‘teacher bashing’ by the Government and Ofsted.

Overall, 25 per cent of schools still have at least one vacancy in maths, 23 per cent do not have enough science staff and 20 per cent are short of English teachers.

The Association of School and College Leaders surveyed almost 800 secondary headteachers across the country.

Some 63 per cent had problems recruiting maths teachers last year; 48.8 per cent for science, and 45.4 per cent in English.

They defined recruitment problems as not having enough good quality applicants for the jobs.

More than one in ten are having difficulty filling roles in geography, modern languages and design and technology.

The schools also struggle to recruit English and maths teachers, with headteachers saying the quality of applicants is not good enough 

Mark Jackson, headteacher of Haslingden High School in Lancashire, said he had just two applicants for a maths position.

He added: ‘We were struggling all last year to get an English teacher. Part of the problem is that there is so much pressure on English teachers. There is a lot of marking; it is an incredible workload.’

A Department for Education spokesman denied a shortage, adding: ‘The teacher vacancy rate has remained low at around 1 per cent or below since 2000.’
