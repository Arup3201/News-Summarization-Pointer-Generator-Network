The Scotland Yard investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann is 'moving forward', a top officer has revealed.

British detectives have issued a new request for help to their Portuguese counterparts in a bid to discover what happened to the youngster.  

It comes amid reports that police are closing in on three 'prime suspects' believed to have been involved in the toddler's disappearance.

Today, Metropolitan Police Deputy Assistant 
Commissioner Martin Hewitt, who is overseeing the operation, said police
 had sent a third international letter of request to Portuguese 
officials.

'Clearly the 
investigative tempo is moving forward as we're progressing the 
investigation and the work that we're asking the Portuguese to undertake
 for us,' he said.

'We sent a further detailed letter of request which went out from the Crown Prosecution Service on Friday.

'This is part of an ongoing process. We are carrying on our liaison at all levels.'

He added that further letters of request would be sent to Portugal on a 'routine' basis as the probe gathers pace. 

Meanwhile, Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, who is leading the hunt for Madeleine, has travelled to Portugal this week to meet senior officers in the Algarve.

Last month, three prime suspects in Madeleine's disappearance were identified by Scotland Yard officers.

Analysis of mobile phone data suggested a burglary gang was operating very near to where she vanished in Portugal in May 2007.

The three men made an unusually high number of calls to each other in the hours after Madeleine was reported missing from her holiday flat.

Police are believed to be closing in on the thieves, including at least one Portuguese man, who had already carried out one raid in the resort of Praia da Luz, according to the Daily Express.

However, the Met Police has refused to comment on the reports  - with Mr Hewitt claiming no requests for interviews or arrests have been made so far.

Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends.

British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany.

After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it.

Today, Scotland Yard stressed that the third international letter of request is a routine part of the inquiry - and would not reveal what it said.

Letters of request are typically used to ask the Portuguese police to carry out certain pieces of work on the British force's behalf.

A spokesman for Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, told the newspaper that the latest request for help was 'a significant development' in the case.
