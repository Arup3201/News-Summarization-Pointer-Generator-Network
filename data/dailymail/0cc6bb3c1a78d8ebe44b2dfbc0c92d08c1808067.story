Costly: More than 900 doctors surgeries around the UK still have 0844 phone numbers - with many taking a cut of the call charges to their patients

Hundreds of GPs are still making patients pay just to call for an appointment – despite the practice being banned three years ago.

The Department of Health has outlawed the use of premium rate 0844 numbers for NHS services but more than 900 surgeries are still using them.

Calling a family doctor on an 0844 line costs up to 41p a minute from a mobile and 5p a minute plus a 13p set-up fee from a BT landline.

Most surgeries using such lines take a slice of the call charges run up by patients, which generally range from 2p-7p a minute. This means patients are effectively subsidising their family doctors.

David Hickson, founder of the Fair Telecoms Campaign, which fights for consumer rights, said: ‘The NHS is funded by taxation.

‘It is unacceptable that GPs take an additional tax on our calls. That tax by telephone is unacceptable.

‘The fundamental principles of our NHS do not permit providers to fund services at the expense of patients.’

His research shows that 839 surgeries in England, plus 40 in Scotland, 38 in Wales and 21 in Northern Ireland are still using 0844 numbers.

This defies official regulations issued in April 2010 ruling that NHS bodies, including GPs, should not charge more for a call than the cost of dialling a local number.

Many GPs were encouraged to install expensive state-of-the-art systems by telecom companies on the basis the cost would be covered through call charges to patients.

Mr Hickson said this was a poor decision and doctors should carry the cost instead of passing it on.

Customers of Virgin Mobile are charged 
41p a minute to call an 0844 number while the figure is 40p with Orange 
and T-Mobile. A ten-minute call, which includes being put on hold, could
cost as much as £4.10.

‘GPs were given 12 months from April 2010 to change their numbers but they did not do it,’ said Mr Hickson. ‘This needs to stop now.’

He said the surgeries should switch to 03 numbers, which carry the same charges as 01 and 02 with no extras.

New rules from Ofcom will require organisations such as GP surgeries to reveal how much they receive per minute from premium rate lines. Campaigners hope this will shame the culprits into action.

The British Medical Association said many of the GPs involved will have to wait until long-term  contracts with telecom firms end.

Dr Laurence Buckman said surgeries had been encouraged by officials to sign up. ‘Services have improved as a result but it is understandable patients are irritated,’ he added.
