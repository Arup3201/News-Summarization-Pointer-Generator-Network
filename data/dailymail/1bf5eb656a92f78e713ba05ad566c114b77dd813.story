Cleared: BBC producer James Whitmarsh

A former BBC producer has been cleared of sexually assaulting a female paramedic after he claimed it was the fault of some oysters he had eaten earlier.

James Whitmarsh, 41, groped the medic after friends called an ambulance because he was acting strangely following a Christmas meal.

Southwark Crown Court heard Whitmarsh had grabbed the paramedic’s buttocks and put his hand between her legs while he was being treated.

But he claimed he had not been in control of his actions after suffering a bad reaction to a seafood starter.

A jury took just 40 minutes to acquit Whitmarsh of one count of sexual assault.

During his trial jurors were told it ‘likely’ Whitmarsh had been poisoned by toxins in an oyster he ate and was not conscious of his actions.

Expert toxicologist and pharmacologist Professor Nicholas Birch said naturally occurring toxins filtered through the shellfish in the sea may not have been properly removed before it was served.

Prof Birch said: ‘In my view if you’ve got mixed batches of oysters it’s possible that oysters from one source that have been incorrectly cleaned got into that batch.

‘Even a single oyster might affect someone.’

Whitmarsh was accused of launching the
assault against the medic, who cannot be named for legal reasons, while
she treated him on the night of December 13.

The ambulance had been called for 
after he began acting erratically, swinging his arms around and 
answering questions with the word ‘Honk’ while eating out in London’s 
West End.

Mr Whitmarsh ate oysters and smoked salmon as a starter a court heard

Whitmarsh had drunk a pint of lager, prosecco and white wine during the evening and his friends had concluded he was drunk.

But Prof Birch said the effects of 
that amount of alcohol would not have been likely to lead to the 
symptoms Whitmarsh displayed.

Defence counsel Ross Cohen asked: ‘Was Mr Whitmarsh likely to have been aware of what he was doing when the ambulance attended?’

Prof Birch replied: ‘From what ‘I’ve heard of the evidence he would not have been aware.’

The barrister then asked: ‘And therefore it is fair to say his actions may not have been under his conscious control?’

Prof Birch answered: ‘That’s fair.’

‘And in your professional opinion 
that’s likely to have been caused by poisoning and highly unlikely to 
have been caused by alcohol?’ asked Mr Cohen.

Prof Birch replied: ‘That’s correct.’

He told the court it was also 
possible Whitmarsh could have been suffered from ‘scombroid food 
poisoning’ contracted from a piece of salmon.

Giving evidence the paramedic, who is 
in her thirties, said: ‘I felt his hand reach underneath and grab me. I 
could feel his fingers, so I wouldn’t call his touch soft. His hand was 
grabbing at me as he groped.

‘Had I not been wearing thick trousers, it would have felt a lot worse.’
