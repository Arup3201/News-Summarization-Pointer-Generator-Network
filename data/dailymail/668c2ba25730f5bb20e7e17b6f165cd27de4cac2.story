From the wildflowers that dot the crumbling slag heaps of south Wales to the elegant lines of the vast industrial chimneys of the North, there's a strange beauty in the remnants of the UK's industrial past.

And no-one knows it better than David Lynch, the American film director turned photographer, whose haunting shots of crumbling factories are the subject of a new exhibition.

The Factory Photographs, which were taken between 1980 and 2000, include brooding shots of power plants and the decaying corners of abandoned manufacturing plants.

Haunting: A brooding photo of a power plant belching steam taken in the late 1980s in the north of England

Beauty: Lynch's lens brings out the geometric beauty in a group of iron electricity pylons, photographed in northern England in the early 1990s

Others provide a new perspective on electricity pylons; the vast metal contraptions given a stark, geometric beauty by Lynch and his lens.

Beautiful though many are, the images, which go on display at The Photographers’ Gallery in London this week, also chart the decline in Britain's manufacturing capability, a fact that becomes starkly apparent in later shots.

'I just like going into strange worlds,' explains Lynch. 'A lot more happens when you open yourself up to the work and let yourself act and react to it.

'Every work ‘talks’ to you, and if you listen to it, it will take you places you never dreamed of.'

Bleak: Lynch's photographs document the decline in heavy industry and the crumbling footprint it leaves on the landscape, in this case in New Jersey

Derelict: The impact of new technology on outdated manufacturing plants is made brutally apparent in this photo, taken in Łódz in 2000

Lynch is certainly no stranger to unusual places and eclectic experiences. A successful director, he is famous for his surrealist films, as well as TV series such as Twin Peaks.

Like his photos, many of his films have an industrial vein running through them and in films such as Eraserhead (1977), The Elephant Man (1980) and Dune (1984) machinery and the sounds of industry dominate the background. 

In The Factory Photos, the machinery and manufacturing plants are pushed into centre stage, much of it looking quaintly old-fashioned.

With traditional manufacturing in terminal decline, Lynch's beautiful photos could, one day, be all we have left of Britain's industrial past.

The Factory Photographs will be displayed at The Photographers’ Gallery (tpg.org.uk) until 30 March 2014. The associated book is published by Prestel (prestel.com)

Obsolete: This photo, taken in Los Angeles in 1980, makes plain the impact of modern technology on industry; once cutting-edge machines now outdated and abandoned

End of an era: The Industrial Revolution of the 1700s has now petered out, edged out by modern technology, as this bleak photo taken in 2000 shows
