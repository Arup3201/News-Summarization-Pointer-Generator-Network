As Britain’s richest comedian with £21 million in the bank, he can afford to indulge.

So when it comes to losing weight, Michael McIntyre has dispensed with the need to shop, measure and cook.

Instead he has opted to have three meals delivered to his door instead at a cost of up to £60 a day.

Mr McIntyre is understood to have enlisted the help of Pure Package, a bespoke diet service, to help him shift the pounds on and off for the last two years.

Britain's richest comedian Michael McIntyre is understood to have enlisted the help of Pure Package, a bespoke diet service, to help him shift the pounds

It means he is estimated to have spent up to £45,000.

The stand-up comedian, who has mocked himself for looking like ‘a fat Chinese man’, is placed on an average daily intake of 1,700 calories when he is on the diet – usually in the run up to gigs and other public or TV appearances. The NHS guidelines say a man’s average calorie count should be 2,500.

When taking a break from his busy working schedule it is believed he allows himself to indulge which explains his famously yo-yoing weight and why he has used the service on and off.

Mr McIntyre has struggled with his size over the years and tried various other ways of slimming down, including cutting out carbohydrates and laying off the booze.

In 2010 he embarked upon a vigorous training regime that saw him lose two stone but he quickly put the weight back on and moaned that it ‘all goes to my face’.

‘I’m one of those people where it all goes to my face,’ he said. ‘I swallow the food and it goes down, then it comes straight back up to my cheeks.

‘I did this diet that I heard Patsy Kensit was doing. She seems to be in pretty good nick - but it didn’t work for me.’

Months later he voiced concerns about ‘looking enormous, not being able to do up my jacket’ ahead of joining the Britain’s Got Talent judging panel in 2011.

He said he wanted ‘to look svelte’ for the show and it is since then that it is believed he has resorted to paying out hundreds of pounds each week to achieve his goals.

Snacks on the diet include dips with crudités, American style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds

On a typical day Mr McIntyre could breakfast on pancakes with mixed fruit and vanilla yoghurt, followed by smoked venison and poached pear salad for lunch and a dinner of satay chicken with rice.

Snacks include dips with crudités, American style muffins or a simple handful of pumpkin seeds.

The menus change daily, which will come as a relief for some of the celebrity clients who have been signed up for as long as eight years.

Others sign up for a short term plan, ahead of film premieres or awards ceremonies. Ruby Wax and Emma Forbes have used the service in the past.

And London Fashion Week has brought a flurry of models and designers signing on short-term to prepare for runway shows, including Lily Cole and Erin O’Conner whose diets total around 1,200 calories per day.

But owner of the Pure Package, Jennifer Irvine, insists that the aren’t ‘faddy’ diets, despite only covering a short time frame.

She said: ‘It’s not a silly lemon juice plan or anything like that. A lot of the models we get coming to us are intelligent people who have long-term careers.

‘They are sensible intelligent women, like Lily Cole and Erin O’Conner so they know they need to do it properly and not go on some faddy diet.

‘It is important to make sure they don’t risk knocking their metabolism out of shape.’

Ms Irvine, who delivers meals to 7,000 well-heeled Londoners every day, has developed several plans to specialise in different areas, including detox and pregnancy.

However 90 per cent of her clients are on the weight-loss programme.

‘Basically the idea of the packages is that clients don’t need to cook,’ she said. ‘They don’t need to go food shopping or to measure ingredients out. It is all done for them.’

Mr McIntyre has certainly had the last laugh at the expense of critics who labelled his giggly, bouncy persona ‘too middle class’ - by being named the most successful stand-up in the world.

According to figures from ticket sales tracker Pollstar, the 36-year-old’s latest tour made him £21million.

More than 600,000 fans flocked to venues around the UK and Ireland to see Showtime!, McIntyre’s 71-date 2012 tour, which included 10 gigs at the massive O2 Arena in London.

His takings from live shows put him alongside the likes of the Rolling Stones, whose five-gig farewell tour netted £22million McIntyre is the only comedian in the top 50 of Pollstar’s top 100 Worldwide Tours of 2012 list, making him the global stand-up king.
