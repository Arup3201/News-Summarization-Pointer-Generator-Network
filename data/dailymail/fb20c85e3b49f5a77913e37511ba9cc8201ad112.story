Labour yesterday completed its U-turn on Universal Credit by offering to back it.

Liam Byrne, the party’s work and pensions spokesman, said the welfare scheme was a ‘good idea in principle’ and that he hoped it would be retained in Labour’s next manifesto.

But he said the implementation of Universal Credit had been a ‘disaster’ and that he had written to Iain Duncan Smith asking for cross-party talks on how to fix the problems with it.

The Labour Party voted against the scheme, which is intended to make sure work always pays, in Parliament last year. But since then some Labour figures have weakened their opposition to it.

Universal Credit is intended to roll six benefits including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefit into one monthly payment.

Trials of the scheme are taking place but the national launch has been delayed.

During a speech to the mentoring charity Chance UK in north London yesterday, Mr Byrne made a personal attack on the Work and Pensions Secretary, saying there ‘seems to be something very wrong in the mind’ of Mr Duncan Smith.

But he later said Mr Duncan Smith was a ‘good man’ and that he wanted them to work together to iron out problems with Universal Credit because the system as currently operated would leave ‘thousands’ of people better off on benefits.

‘Last year he said there would be a million people on Universal Credit by next April,’ said Mr Byrne. ‘I think it was also said new applications for benefits by this October would be for Universal Credit.

‘Both of those targets have disappeared but no new targets have come back into their place. Who on earth knows what’s going on?’

A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘This is a last-ditch attempt by Liam Byrne to keep his job in the Shadow Cabinet. Nothing more.’
