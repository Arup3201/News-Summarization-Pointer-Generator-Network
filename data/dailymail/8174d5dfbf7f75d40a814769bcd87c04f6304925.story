As Saturday night's show came to a close and the X Factor crowd erupted into applause for Ben Haenow's rendition of Hallelujah, the 29-year-old contestant couldn't hold back his emotion.

Not only was it the pinnacle of Ben's X Factor journey, but as Ben explains to the MailOnline, it also felt like the culmination of years of hard slog in the music industry.

'It was  emotional,' Ben says from his tour bus. ‘For me it all came to a head, thinking back over what I’ve been through and the reasons I entered the competition.'

Ben Haenow couldn't hold back his emotion on Saturday night's show: 'For me it all came to a head, thinking back over what I’ve been through and the reasons I entered the competition'

This week Ben is riding up and down the country in his very own tour bus with friends and family on board

'For me, it's about trying to succeed in an industry that for I've been trying to making it in for years, to the point of nearly giving up.'

Ben has sung in bands with his big brother, Alex, since they were children, and for the best part of a decade has been playing gigs up and down the country, hoping to break into the industry. 

'We used to play gigs around the South East. When you're spending money on petrol and not being paid anything to cover costs, it becomes hard slog. 

'I started thinking, "I’m playing to five or ten people and I've travelled all this way. What for?" People are just there to drink – not really to listen to your band anyway.'

Vote for Ben! Just to hammer the point home, Ben stood in front of some very important words 

'No one's ever said, "You're not good enough" but then again I haven't always had the best feedback. I've been heckled on stage with people saying "get off" and stuff like that. 

'It's no different to the rubbish gigs that countless other musicians will have experienced. But when you're not getting the recognition you want to, it does start to get to you,' admits Ben.

As he sang the last few notes of Leonard Cohen's melancholic tune, those experiences were whirring round his head.

Not all the judges were complimentary of Ben's rendition but Simon said: 'I am going to remember that performance. Your voice broke in places because you're emotional... you've earned your place in this final.' 

Ben explains: 'At that moment, that stage felt like an amazing place to be  and everything was going through my head. I was also thinking how much that moment could change mine and my family's life.'

So what would it mean to the van driver from Croydon to win? 'Jeeees,' Ben says. 'It would make my life!

'It would help get us, my family, in a better place. We live in a council estate and me, my mum and brother live together. So I'd like to sort my family out with somewhere else to live.'

'I just want to make my mum’s life a bit easier. I'd like it if she didn’t have to worry as she gets older and for her not to have to work quite so hard,' he adds.

The other important women in the singer's life is his girlfriend of six-and-a-half years, Jessica Jones, who the singer plans to propose to in the near future.

But for the moment, what's on Ben's horizon is going on tour with his X Factor buddies. 'It's going to be the most amazing experience,' Ben says.

'It'll be a taster of what want to do for rest of life – to make make music and play gigs.'

'I can’t believe there’s a bus with my face on it – it’s a massive coach full of people that mean everything to me. That's the most important bit. 

'It’s going to be the busiest week of my life but I’m looking forward to it and Simon Cowell may even pop on.'

The music mogul, Ben says, has been a great source of support and advice.

'He's always told me to stay focused and try to be true to the musician you want to be in the real world. 

'He’s lovely - he’s had all that success but he’s just a normal guy.

'I respect all the judges, which is why I don't mind the criticism. On the X Factor you put yourself up on that platform to take on people’s opinions and be judged. But it's lucky to be in a position to get a critique from these people who have been in the industry for years.'

Before appearing on the show, Ben says he was 'jeans and T-shirt guy' but says he'll take away some style tips. 

Going well, then? The 29-year-old heart throb gave a big thumbs up as he arrived at London's Global studios

'I've always worn trainers, so wearing boots and skinny jeans is new to me. There have also been a lot of leather jackets. Leather jackets weren’t exactly what I would have worn previously.

'Obviously being caked in makeup is not what I'm used to either but I won’t be taking that into my daily life.

'But having a team of people working with you and styling you have been great. At least I haven’t had to wear any sequin onesies or anything like that!' 

Contrary to rumours, Ben confirms the boys in the house haven't been ordered to lose weight by X Factor bosses.

'There's no truth in that,' he says, but does admit: 'There's been a biscuit and chocolate ban in the house since I got here. They don’t want everyone gorging themselves on choc and sweets, which is understandable. 

'But there's been no specific message for me and Andrea to stop eating and go on a diet.

'Anyway, you want to look after yourself when you're on stage - you want to look good and feel confident.'

But one area Ben says has been slipping is his fitness. X factor madness has meant he doesn't have time for his regular hour and a half daily swim and has spent less time in the gym.

'My brother is big into the gym and he’s in great shape so he usually spurs me on,' he admits. 

Can Ben reveal what audiences have in store this weekend?

'I can't give anything away,' he says. 'But everyone’s in for something really special?  

The X Factor Final takes place on ITV at 8.30pm on Saturday December 13 and 8pm on Sunday December 14
