With his adorable smile, soft skin and gorgeous blue eyes, it is little wonder Rowan Stone wowed judges and beat 2,300 other children to be crowned Britain's Cutest Baby.

At just seven months old, little Rowan is set for stardom after winning a modelling contract which seems certain to land him TV appearances and magazine shoots.

Thrilled parents Becki, 29, and Thomas 28, spoke of their delight at learning their 'cheeky chappy' had taken the title.

Adorable: Little Rowan Stone from Solihull in the West Midlands has landed himself a modelling contract at the age of seven months after judges crowned him Britain's cutest baby

But they joked their pride and joy is more likely to be excited by the Â£500 worth of toy vouchers he won in addition to his year-long contract.

Marketing executive Becki, from Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'I am so thrilled to find out Rowan has been named as the winner. We are so proud.

'We had been told by a few friends that Rowan could be a model and when we saw this competition we thought why not, never thinking he would win.

'We had just wanted some shots for posterity, to remember him in the cute stage - but the photographer told us we should enter the competition.

'We always knew he was a little cutie, but it's lovely to have some recognition of the fact.

'The judges told us it was a unanimous decision from all four of them.

'There were so many other cute babies in the competition, but he's just so happy and loves people.'

So proud: Parents Becki, 29, and Thomas, 28, are overjoyed at the the prospect of seeing their son adorn magazine covers and make appearances on TV

The family now hope Rowan proves a hit on TV and say they can't wait to see his face adorning magazine covers.

Becki said: 'I think Thomas and I are probably a bit over the hill for modelling now, but it'll be great to watch Rowan's career.

'It's just a case of wait and see.'

Thomas added: 'Rowan is a very bubbly, spirited young boy who loves life.

'His image captures one of his favourite things, his bath time, which finishes with us wrapping him up in his eared hooded towel.

'Both Becki and I are so proud of him and to hear the judges say what we see is really heart warming.'

Bundle of joy: Little Rowan shows his delight as he yelps with happiness at winning the title of Britain's cutest baby

More than 24,000 people voted online in the 'Little Face of Venture' competition, which is run by Venture Photography.

Creative Director Richard Mayfield said: 'With so many fantastic images to choose from, picking one winner was an enormously tricky task but in the end we had to choose Rowan as our winner because we love the expression and personality on this image.

'Rowan showed bundles of character during the photoshoot.

'We wish him well in his fledgling career as a model.'

The contract is with Covent Garden agency MOT models.
