Two sisters were killed in an automobile accident early Friday morning on a Delaware road with a long history of tragedy.

Ashlyn and Devyn Sisson, 23 and 22 years old, respectively, were traveling down Paper Mill Road, just north of Newark, Delaware, when the older sister lost control of her 2002 Plymouth Neon, crossed a low concrete median and slammed into a utility pole, killing both women.

Their deaths are the ninth and tenth automobile fatalities on that stretch of road since 2000.

The car the sisters were in jumped the median and crashed into a utility pole on a road known for fatal accidents

The two sisters crashed as they were driving home from work at The Greene Turtle Sports Bar and Grille in Newark, where co-workers were grieving the loss of the two young women.

'This is a tragic loss for us, the Turtle family and the 
restaurant,' restaurant manager Jerry Mazurowski told Delawareonline.com.

He went on to say that the Sisson sisters had worked at the restaurant since it first opened in December of 2012, adding that 'they were great young ladies.'

Initial reports show that drugs or alcohol were not a factor in the crash. However, neither sister was wearing her seatbelt.

'They always wore their seat belts,' friend Sydney Pensky told the publication. 'They even put the seat 
belt on the dog, Sephora.'

Sephora was Ashlyn's husky, which is now being cared for by family members.

Pensky says that if the sisters weren't wearing their seatbelts, it was likely because 'they must have been trying to get out.'

Pensky says the women were as close as two sisters could be

'They were always together like yin and yang,' she said. 'They never 
left each other's side. They just got matching tattoos of yin and yang.'

The girls' friend says that she is at a loss for what could have caused the crash, as it happened on a road they frequently drove.

'They weren't drinking, they weren't smoking, they were sober,' Pensky said, adding that 'I think there must have been a deer or something.'

Authorities are still investigating the crash on the road that has seen several fatal accidents over the last several years.

According to Delawareonline.com, four construction workers from Mexico were killed in October of 2007, when they collided with another vehicle near the same intersection where the Sisson sisters were killed. The driver of the second vehicle was an unlicensed 17-year-old who had been drinking and also died. 

Another fatal crash occurred in 2000, killing a Pennsylvania man. Alcohol was factor in that crash, as well, according to the publication.

A 23-year-old woman was killed in 2010 when her car crossed over the median near the same intersection on Paper Mill Road, overturned and struck a utility pole.

Another crash - this one in October of 2011 - took the life of a 40-year-old woman after a 21-year-old man who later was charged with manslaughter, driving under the influence and driving with a suspended license caused a six-car accident when he rammed into the back of a stopped car near the intersection where the two sisters were killed.
