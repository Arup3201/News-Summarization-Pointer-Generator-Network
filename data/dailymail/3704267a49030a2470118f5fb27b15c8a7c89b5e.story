A four-year-old boy died after he was hit by a car driven by his mother's friend while he crossed the road, an inquest heard yesterday.

James Robinson had just visited an ice cream van to buy sweets and lollies when he was mown down by a driver who knew his family.

His mother described the boy as 'my little soulmate' and said she would struggle to continue without him.

Tragic: Four-year-old James Robinson was killed after being hit by car while crossing the road

The schoolboy was playing with friends in Stockton-on-Tees on August 5 last year when the tragic accident happened.

James was with other children on the local green while his mother Emma Oram was in a friend's front garden nearby.

His mother's friend gave him money to buy ice cream from a van across the road, and the children went alone to buy the treats.

Moments after leaving the van, James was struck by a Ford Fiesta being driven by his mother's friend Jane Ford.

Geoffrey Burdon, the ice cream van driver, dialled 999, but paramedics were unable to save the boy and the was pronounced dead at the University Hospital of North Tees an hour later.

Mr Burdon told Tuesday's inquest: 'Three children walked up to the van. The youngest was about three and the eldest was six or seven.

'There weren't any adults with them.'

Julie Ford, the driver's cousin, said she had asked Jane Ford to drive her to a local shop.

'As the front of Jane's car went forward we hit something,' she told the inquest. 'I saw a child in the road and knew from the clothing it was James.'

Accident investigator Peter Gowland said the car was in good condition, adding that Ms Ford could not see James, who was small for his age, before the collision and would not have had the chance to stop.

Tribute: The area where James died was covered in flowers and toys in memory of the little boy

Much missed: James's mother said she 'cannot be apart from him' as she called the boy her 'soulmate'

The inquest heard that the boy probably lost consciousness immediately and died of head and internal injuries.

Assistant deputy coroner Claire Bailey, recording a verdict of accidental death, said: 'James will not have felt any pain and this hopefully will give some comfort to those loved ones left behind.

'Taking into account all the evidence, James's tragic death came about as the result of an accident.'

Ms Oram paid tribute to her son at the time of his death, describing him as 'our pride and joy' and adding that the four-year-old - who was nicknamed Spider-Man because he often wore a superhero outfit - was 'always boisterous, loud and fun-loving'.

She continued: 'He was well and truly spoilt by all the family, but he was such a loving little boy that we did not care.

'As a mother, I used to do everything with James. He was my little soulmate - my strength - and I cannot bear to be apart from him.'
