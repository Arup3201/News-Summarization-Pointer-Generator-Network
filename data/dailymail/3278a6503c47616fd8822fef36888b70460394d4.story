Thierry Henry has brought an end to his illustrious playing career by announcing his retirement from professional football. 

The former Arsenal striker left New York Red Bulls at the end of the MLS season and he will now take up a position at Sky Sports as a pundit.

The French forward joins Sky's already strong line-up of analysts including Gary Neville, Jamie Carragher and Jamie Redknapp.

Thierry Henry was Arsenal's leading scorer with 228 goals, 175 of those in the Premier League

Henry has been confirmed as a full-time pundit for Sky Sports 

Henry will be remembered as one of the best strikers the Premier League has ever seen after what he achieved at Arsenal.

Having moved to north London from Juventus in 1999, the Frenchman spent eight years as a Gunner and became a legend at the club.

Henry is the highest scorer in Arsenal's history with 228 goals in all competitions, 175 of those coming in the Premier League.

He helped Arsene Wenger's side win the Premier League and FA Cup double in 2002 and was also part of the invincible title-winning team of 2004.

The forward then spent three years at Barcelona, winning two La Liga titles and the Champions League, before moving to New York Red Bulls in 2010.

He returned to Arsenal for a loan spell in January 2012, scoring the winner against Leeds in the FA Cup and Sunderland in the league.

But Henry's four-year stay in New York has now come to an end, and he will take up a role as an analyst with Sky Sports.

The Frenchman said: 'I’ve been fortunate enough to have had an amazing playing career with many incredible memories and now I can’t wait for the next chapter to begin with Sky Sports.

'I played for some of the best teams in football and now I’m joining what I think is the best team in television. I’m looking forward to joining the guys and helping to provide Sky Sports viewers with the best possible analysis. I can’t wait.'

Henry had been tipped to go into management once he hung up his boots and while he will be joining Sky in the studio, he has not ruled out a career in the dugout. 

He told Sky Sports: 'I don’t know if I can be a good coach or not, but the desire is there. We’ll see. Just because you can play the game doesn’t mean you can teach it - dealing with egos and lifting people.'

But Henry did admit he did not think a third return to Arsenal was not a good idea. 

'We didn’t talk too much about that,’ said Henry. ‘How many comebacks do you make? It would have turned into a bad movie. It would have been like the film Rocky, you like the first one but what about the last one?'

Sportsmail columnist and Sky Sports pundit Jamie Carragher said: 'Defenders everywhere will be breathing a sigh of relief that he has hung his boots up. 

'He was certainly the toughest opponent I ever faced and possibly the best player the Premier League has seen. I would have loved him to be on the same team as me during my playing career, I’m delighted we’re finally on the same side.'

And Sportsmail and Sky's Jamie Redknapp added: 'I know from playing against Thierry how good a player he was and Sky Sports viewers are in for a treat. 

'His game was built around incredible pace, power and finishing, not to mention the ability to read the game better than most. His views will be fascinating and I can’t wait to work alongside him.'

Theo Walcott was on Twitter after hearing the news, thanking Henry for inspiring him at Arsenal.

The England ace said: 'A true inspiration to me in my career. Thank you @Thierryhenry & good luck in your new path with @skysports.'
