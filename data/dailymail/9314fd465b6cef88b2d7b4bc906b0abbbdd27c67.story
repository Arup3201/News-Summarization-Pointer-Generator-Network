England's victorious Ashes team celebrated their win over the old enemy Australia by getting drunk on the Oval pitch before apparently urinating all over the wicket.

Star players including Kevin Pietersen, Stuart
Broad, and Jimmy Anderson reportedly queued to relieve themselves on the strip while teammates cheered wildly.

A picture tweeted by England's wicket keeper Matt Prior showed the squad sat on the Oval after dark surrounded by beer and champagne.

The story has come from the Australian media, who could be accused of sour grapes after their team lost 3-0 after a five-match series this summer.

The Herald Sun in Melbourne called it a 'distasteful incident' that was carried out in full view of the press box - but after the 23,500 fans had gone.

Malcolm Conn wrote in the Herald Sun: 'While the centre of the ground was quite dark, lights were on in the grandstands with dozens of people still cleaning up after a late finish which saw the game go beyond 7.30pm.

'A number of players including Stuart Broad, Kevin Pietersen and Jimmy Anderson took it in turns urinating on the pitch to the cheers of their team mates.

'This could be clearly seen from the outside overflow areas of the press box.'

The England and Wales Cricket Board was unavailable for comment this morning.

Fun and frolics: Stuart Broad tweeted a picture of Alastair Cook and Matt Prior hailing a bus late last night

Twitter gave an interesting insight into the night of celebration for the English cricketers.

As well as Matt Prior's pitch picture, bowler Stuart Broad tweeted a photo of captain Alastair Cook hailing a night bus.

Swashbuckling batsman Kevin Pietersen admitted to a hangover this morning, tweeting: 'Morning #ouch #mayday'.

If the players were urinating on the pitch, it could be a joke at the expense of teammate Monty Panesar.

The spinner went on a drunken rampage which ended with him relieving himself on nightclub bouncers.

Joke: Although the Australian media called it distasteful, former England captain Michael Vaughan is among those to laugh at the alleged incident

Lampoon: Mr Vaughan posted this picture of the Oval shown normally from the south London sky and then as a giant toilet

The Sikh, who is meant to abstain from alcohol under the Sikh 
code of conduct, was forced to apologise after being fined Â£90 for his 
drunken antics at a nightclub in Brighton two weeks ago.

The 
31-year-old, who was dropped by England ahead of the Ashes series 
because of his poor performance, was thrown out of Shooshh on Brighton 
seafront after a group of young women complained that he was bothering 
them.

He is believed to have then gone on to the promenade above the club and relieved himself over the doormen below.

Witnesses
said the bouncers gave chase and cornered the cricketer in a pizza 
restaurant before putting him in an arm lock and dragging him back to 
the venue in tears.

The spin bowler has kept his separation from his wife of three years Gursharan Rattan a secret.

But friends of the star have claimed his recent troubles are a result of his heartbreak over the breakdown of his marriage to the pharmacist. He has since left Sussex to play for Essex.
