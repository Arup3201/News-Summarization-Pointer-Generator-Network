A horse-drawn beach hut in Cornwall has been placed on the market for the first time since it was purchased 92 years ago, and the price has certainly increased.

Holidaymakers who want to snap up the holiday chalet will have to splash out £80,000 for the property - compared to just £10 spent on the hut back in 1924.

The beach hut, named Roskear, was bought by the Truan family from Camborne in 1924, when farmers were still using horses to pull their ploughs.

The Cornish beach hut is expected to fetch around £80,000 when it goes up for sale, and has a whole lot of history behind it

Electricity was added in the 1950s, and despite the cramped nature of the hut, there are plenty of facilities

It might be small, but a bit like Doctor Who's Tardis, appearances can be deceptive for inside it has two bedrooms, a hall and a toilet extension

Every year on April 1, the Truans, along with many other local families, could get permission to simply hitch up a horse and tow their chalet on to the seaside dunes at Riviere Towans in St Ives Bay for the summer season. 

In 1926 the chalet was the first to be given a permanent fixed and anchored position in the dunes where it remains today. Now the little hut, the oldest still existing on Riviere Towans, is up for sale and is expected to fetch at least £80,000. 

A reminder of a bygone age, it is largely untouched from the time it was purchased for £10 in 1924, say selling agents Driftwood Properties.

While it may need a bit of touch-up work here and there, the beach hut offers a real escape from everyday life

There is enough room to add your own personal touches to the beach hut should you wish

Over the years the Truans added extensions for sleeping accommodation and toilet facilities, adding electricity in the 1950s - another first - and cladding a decade later.

During the war years, trenches were dug outside its door, and later more chalets were built around it and larger holiday companies arrived in St Ives Bay. 

Original features dating back to 1924 include the doors, windows, a Belfast sink and a meat safe. It has a living room, two bedrooms and an attached outside toilet cubicle.

Audrey Chivers, daughter of John Truan, who bought the property the day she was born, inherited it as a wedding gift. She died last year.

Family friend John Prela, who was charged with selling the hut, said: 'John Truan worked for Camborne Railway Station and was transferred to Reading but they would come down several times a year.

'All different relatives used to come down. It slept up to eight people - I don't know where they all went! 'For about 30 years Audrey and her husband would come down in April and stay till September. She loved her hut.' 

The property was enjoyed by all the Truan family, and their extended relatives, and is now described as 'the most original property on the park' by the estate agents

Ben Downton, of Driftwood Properties, which is selling the chalet, told MailOnline Travel: 'It has got to be the most original property on the park.

'I think it would be for a specific kind of person, but we expect there to be a good deal of interest.

'I think there is massive potential to extend the property, on that park this is happening all the time.

'We would expect the new owner to want to develop and modify the hut, but it would be nice if some of the history and core features of the property can remain.'
