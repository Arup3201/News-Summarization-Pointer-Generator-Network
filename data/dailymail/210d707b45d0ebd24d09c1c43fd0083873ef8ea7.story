Charged: Ranya Al-Huthaili, of Roseville, pictured, was charged on September 12 with robbing the Dairy State Bank in Menomonie, Wisconsin - the last of the string of heists she's allegedly behind

A 23-year-old Minnesota woman is accused of holding up five banks in three weeks, hiding her face under a hijab and big sunglasses.

Ranya Al-Huthaili, of Roseville, was charged on September 12 with robbing the Dairy State Bank in Menomonie, Wisconsin - the last of the string of heists she's allegedly behind beginning August 15.

The Saudi-U.S. woman was arrested on September 9 at Rosedale Shopping Center, after FBI agents traced marked notes she was handed at the Menomonie branch to her home.

According to court documents in the Menomonie heist, Al-Huthaili gave the teller a note that read, 'I have a gun.'

She allegedly demanded money and the teller gave her $2,350, which included 'bait bills' that are marked so police can easily trace them, the Star Tribune reported.

FBI agents used the bills to locate her Roseville residence and the next day followed her to Rosedale, where they witnessed her purchase a laptop computer with cash.

After she left the store, the agents examined the cash, determining it was that stolen in the Menomonie holdup.

Al-Huthaili was arrested that night and agents say she admitted to a September 5 holdup of the First State Bank and Trust in Hudson as well as the one in Menomonie on Monday.

The FBI believes she also robbed the Klein Bank in Cologne on August 15, the First State Bank of Wyoming in Stacy on August 23 and the TCF Bank in the Cub Foods on Broadway Avenue West in Forest Lake on September 1.

Surveillance: According to court documents in the Menomonie heist, Al-Huthaili, pictured in surveillance footage, gave the teller a note that read, 'I have a gun'

Disguise: Surveillance images, from the bank robberies showed Ranya al-Huthaili wearing big black sunglasses

She is seen on surveillance video at a number of the locations.

The 2008 graduate of Roseville High School celebrated her 23rd birthday the day after the Stacy robbery.

According to Al Arabiya, Al-Huthaili, a dual Saudi-U.S. citizen, is now deemed a flight risk as court documents state Saudi Arabia has no extradition pact with the United States. As such, she remains in federal custody.

Huthaili's exact nationality and family background is not clear but sources told Al Arabiya that she comes from a well-to-do family.
