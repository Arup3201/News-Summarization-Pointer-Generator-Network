TV show Grand Designs is deterring people from building their own home because they think it must be a Hobbit’s house constructed from ‘yoghurt and goat hair’, a government minister has warned.

Nick Boles said self-build should be an affordable option for people struggling to get on to the property ladder.

But the planning minister told MailOnline that it need not involve a ‘funky architect’ drawing up plans for dramatic dwellings which look like the ‘Battlestar Galactica has landed on Surrey’.

Channel 4's Grand Designs, hosted by Kevin McCloud, risks putting people off the idea of building their own home

The government has unveiled a £150million fund to kickstart a wave of self-build across the country.

The money will be used to provide up to 10,000 serviced plots which are ready to be built on, with water, sewage and power supplies, a dropped kerb outside and where archaeological checks have been carried out.

The Treasury says it wants to emulate Germany and the Netherlands where tens of thousands of people have built their own homes as an alternative to trying to raise the money for an existing property.

A recent survey suggested one in seven Brits will research how to build a home for themselves within the next 12 months.

But Mr Boles insisted the homes do not need to resemble the ambitious and vastly expensive projects which feature on Channel 4’s Grand Designs – which often run over time and budget.

Planning minister Nick Boles said he wants people to realise building their own home is an affordable option

He told MailOnline: ‘I love Grand Designs, the programme, as much as anybody.

'But what we need is not so much grand designs but affordable designs so anybody inclined to build a starter home can look at it as a mainstream option.

‘We need to get away from the idea that these things have to be made out of yoghurt and goats hair; that unless it is something that is designed by some out-there architect and looks like a Hobbit house or Battlestar Galactica has landed on Surrey, it's not a Grand Design.

‘These builds can be essentially quite ordinary. They are probably going to be slightly more in keeping with a local area because they are not designed in some headquarters of a house building company miles away.

‘They are designed by a local builder for somebody locally. It's not somebody just doing it to make money and run - there will be conditions attached to prevent that.’

Under the new Right to Buy, local residents will be able to demand the council sell them a plot which has water, electricity and other utilities already connected.

‘It doesn't need to be you laying the bricks or having a funky architect,’ Mr Boles said. ‘You can have something just a bit more personal, the number of bedrooms and so on.

‘You can actually save quite a chunk of money building yourself, even if you are not actually doing the work.’

The Right to Build will be consulted on this summer, with the law changed if the Tories win the next election.

Self-build projects can be cheaper than buying a starter home, and are more likely to be in keeping with the local area, Mr Boles claimed

In many countries, including Austria, Belgium, Italy and Sweden, more than half of all homes are self-build projects

But Mr Boles hopes a few councils will act as ‘vanguards’ to trial the process before 2015.

‘This is an affordable option. The core idea is that if you live in a local area for a period of time, maybe two or three years, so you demonstrate some kind of local link, you would be able to put yourself on a list just like you would for social housing and say: I want a serviced plot of land with infrastructure and basic utilities on it.

‘The council would have a duty to offer you a plot within a period of time.’

He said the policy could be as revolutionary as Margaret Thatcher giving council tenants the right to buy their own council house in the 1980s.

‘When people used to approach councils saying we would quite like to buy our council house or council flat, they got a flea in their ear,’ Mr Boles said.

‘Once the Conservative government gave people a Right to Buy their council play if they fulfilled certain conditions then suddenly they flew off the shelves. It was a complete transformation. The idea is [Right to Build] would have a similarly revolutionary effect.’
