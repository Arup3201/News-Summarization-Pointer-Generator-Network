A woman had an epic meltdown this week on a Tampa, Florida-bound flight.

The unidentified woman screamed over and over at the top of her lungs after going up and down the aisles of the plane telling people to pray for her deceased mother.

‘God you’re my savior,’ she repeated as often and quickly as possible, while contorting and shaking in her seat as shocked passengers tried not to draw her attention.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Seeking salvation: The blonde woman in this YouTube video had an epic meltdown as the man in the black hat tried to calm her down

The video, uploaded Wednesday to YouTube, has had well over 100,000 views, and shows the woman going 
crazy as the plane lands in Tampa.

Perhaps distraught over the recent loss of her mother, the woman is seen at the beginning of the video screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ at the top of her lungs.

Shot by Reed Stanley, video shows the man sitting next to the hysterical woman trying to calm her down. His failure to calm her elicits an exasperated shrug of the shoulders.

‘She’s been freaking out for the last 20 minutes,’ Mr Stanley explains over the shouting woman. ‘She started off by telling everyone to pray for her mother who just passed away.

‘She went up and down the aisles telling everyone to pray for her mother,’ Mr Stanley further explains as the woman’s tirade shows no signs of slowing down. ‘

Get me out of here: The woman in the aisle seat can't get off the plane fast enough

The woman appears to be both looking at her powered on smartphone and reading a magazine while repeatedly screaming ‘God you’re my savior’ in non-stop repetition.

The man sitting next to her continues to try to calm her down as passengers shown behind her are tiring of the routine.

‘I don’t know if this guy next to her knows her or not,’ Mr Stanley further narrates over the unending barrage of proclamation, ‘but he’s been trying to calm her down the whole time.’

The plane then appears to touch down on the airport runway, as it visibly shakes before lights and other vehicles are then seen outside the window behind the distraught woman.

The man’s efforts to calm the woman finally incense her, as she points and yells ‘don’t f**king touch me’ at him before repeating her mantra and apologizing to God for cursing.

She then goes right back into repeating ‘God you’re my savior and fast and loud as she can.

Clearly distraught: The crazed woman asked passengers to pray for her recently deceased mother before launching into her repetitious rant

Right as she appears to run out of steam, finally quieting down, Mr Stanley explains the flight attendant asked him to make sure the woman doesn’t make a run for the plane’s door.

‘If she tries to go back, we’re going to block her,’ Mr Stanley said as the woman’s meltdown caught a second wind.

Though not as loud and fast as before, the mantra is repeated over and over.

It is not clear what the woman’s ultimate fate was, she has not been publicly identified.

Then, like a voice from the heavens, an automated message advised passengers to ‘remain in their seats’ until the aircraft arrived at its gate.

Salvation had finally come for the passengers, the end of their hellish flight.
