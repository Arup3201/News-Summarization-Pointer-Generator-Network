There's a hitchhiker making its way across Canada who doesn't have a driver's license--because it's a robot.

HitchBOT, created by a team of communication researchers from Ontario, has already been hitchhiking since July and will visit Halifax, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia and so far has managed to safely travel 3,700 miles.

'Robots cannot get driver’s licenses yet,' explains the two-foot tall robot that looks like a modern day R2D2.

The goal of the project, as explained by one of the robot's inventors David Smith, is to see how comfortable humans are when traveling with robots.

It's also a way of seeing how a robot will react to an unpredictable situation.

'What we wanted to do is situate robotics and artificial technologies into unlikely scenarios and push the limits of what it's capable of, ‘he told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.

'It's challenging but it can also be highly engaging and entertaining as hitchBOT has proven.'

The Daily Dot reports that the bot is equipped with a car seat attached to its torso so it can be easily strapped to cars and a GPS system so that researchers can track its travels.

Not only can hitchBOT sit safely in the passenger's seat, it has speech recognition software and can answer simple questions.

When hitchBOT is running low on battery it can ask the driver to plug it in to an outlet or cigarette lighter.

HitchBOT has taken to social media to report its travels and yesterday wrote, 'This week I'll be meeting with B.C. First Nations, taking a quick jaunt to Seattle, then arriving at my final destination, Open Space artist center in Victoria on Thursday the 21st.'

HitchBOT has attracted over 43,000 Facebook likes and has driven with families, Canadian rock bands and has even traveled by boat.

The Daily Dot reports that the robot will arrive at its final destination later this week where of course it will be welcomed by a traditional Aboriginal canoe ceremony.

Along the way, hitchBOT was invited to a pow-wow with the Wikwemikong First Nation group, where the robot was dubbed Biiaabkookwe, according to its Twitter feed. It later hitched a ride with Belgian tourists.

HitchBOT hung out with the British Columbia rock band The Wild, which is taking it to its next performance.

Smith said his team monitors hitchBOT via GPS and social media but drivers have been in control of where they take it and leave it. Smith said the team had replacement robots to continue the journey in case anything happened to hitchBOT, but so far, the robot has not been mistreated.

The child-sized robot is able to able to stand, making it visible to drivers via a retractable tripod. It has a car seat attached to its torso so drivers can strap it into their cars using seatbelts.

Matthew Berry, of Alberta, said some friends picked up the robot while heading to a wedding in Golden, B.C. They picked it up on the border between Alberta and Calgary, where its previous driver was looking to offload it.

'It was good fun; we took it out onto the dance floor to, well, do the real robot," Berry said. "It was funny because it was a very meticulously planned wedding so I wasn't sure how the bride would react, but she loved it!'

Berry said while the couple was giving their speech, the bride thanked the couple's friends for attending, and the robot interrupted, saying, 'I like to make friends.'
