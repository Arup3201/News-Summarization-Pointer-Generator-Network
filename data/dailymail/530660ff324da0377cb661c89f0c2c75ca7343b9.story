The couple accused of kidnapping their two young sons and fleeing by boat to Cuba were today booked into a Florida jail after being handed over to U.S. authorities.

According to a website for the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office, Joshua Michael Hakken and his wife Sharyn are being held at the jail early Wednesday on a number of charges including kidnapping, child neglect and interference with custody.

Authorities say Joshua Michael Hakken kidnapped his sons, four-year-old Cole and two-year-old Chase, from his mother-in-law's house north of Tampa. The boys' maternal grandparents had been granted permanent custody of the boys last week.

Stowaway: The Salty boat is moored at the Marina Hemingway complex in Havana today

Earlier Tuesday, Foreign Ministry official Johana Tablada said in a statement that Cuba had informed U.S. authorities of the country's decision to turn over the couple and their children.

Authorities received information that
the Hakken family had arrived on the island nation on Monday and a CNN 
reporter who sailed to the shore questioned a man on a boat who said he 
was Josh Hakken.

He declined to answer questions however and Cuban security asked the CNN reporter to leave.

He was with a woman fitting the description of his wife who said the two boys were doing OK.

The sheriff's office alleges that 
Joshua Michael Hakken entered his mother-in-law's house north of Tampa 
early last Wednesday, tied her up and fled with his sons, four-year-old 
Cole and two-year-old Chase.

International incident: Police are now trying to figure out where in Cuba the family is hiding out

Federal, state and local authorities 
had been searching by air and sea for a boat Hakken recently bought. The
Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office confirmed Friday that the 
35-year-old father  recently bought a 
25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull with the word 'Salty' 
painted on it and white paw prints on both sides. The boat's whereabouts
are unknown.

An inspection of a similar watercraft
shows that Hakken likely bought it with the kidnapping in mind, as it 
has enough room to easily fit four people on board.

A man who owns a similar boat told 
local station WTSP that there is a bed space, a stove and plenty of 
storage room for food and water.

Clue: Officials searching for Cole and Chase Hakken came across the black 2006 GMC pickup belonging to the boys' father on the second floor of the John's Pass garage in Madeira Beach

New twist: Officials say suspected kidnapper Joshua Hakken recently bought a 25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull, and they suspect he and his family are on it now

'This boat sails so well that one man can single-hand it in almost any conditions,' said owner Jim DeSanto.

'I don't think it's an accident. If he had this planned out, it wasn't an accident,' DeSanto said of Hakken's decision to pick that particular model of boat.

The truck that Hakken, his wife 
Sharyn and the boys had been traveling in was found late Thursday, 
abandoned in a parking garage in Madeira Beach.

Authorities say they had been looking
up and down the entire Gulf coast from Pensacola to the Keys and the 
Intracoastal Waterway.

Last sighting: The family were seen sailing in their boat underneath the John¿s Pass Bridge towards the Gulf of Mexico after ditching their truck

An Amber Alert for the boys has been issued in Florida, Louisiana and other states as part of standard kidnapping protocols.

The boys had been living since last year with their maternal grandparents, who were granted permanent custody last Tuesday.

Joshua Hakken lost custody of his 
sons last year after a drug possession arrest in Louisiana, and he later
tried to take them from a foster home at gunpoint, authorities have 
said.

According to Louisiana police, 
maternal grandmother Patricia Hauser noticed that her son-in-law had a 
gun when he came to her house to kidnap the children, and before he left
she heard him say:

'Phase one completed. Ready for phase two.'

Crime scene: Officials say Joshua Hakken entered a home in the 14000 block of Shady Shores Drive owned by his sons' maternal grandmother, tied up the woman and abducted the boys

Wanted: Law enforcement officers stand in front of the home of Joshua Hakken at 3609 Sterling Avenue in Tampa as a K-9 dog searches the perimeter of the home

Authorities have previously characterized the Hakkens as 'anti-government.'

'These are not dumb people. They're very intelligent people with some emotional issues,' Hillsborough Sheriff's spokesman Larry McKinnon said.

'Our goal is to still resolve this peacefully.'

Court documents released Friday state
that Mr Hakken has previously planned to commit suicide and discussed 
taking 'a journey to Armageddon,' The Tampa Bay Times previously reported.

The sheriff's office issued a warrant
for the arrest of Joshua Hakken, who faces two counts of kidnapping, 
two counts child neglect, two counts false imprisonment, one count 
burglary with a battery and one count grand theft auto.
