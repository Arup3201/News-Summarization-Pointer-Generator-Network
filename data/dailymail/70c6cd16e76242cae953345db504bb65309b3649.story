Burnley defender Kieran Trippier has signed a new three-year deal with the club.

The right-back had one-year remaining on his previous deal but has now extended his stay at Turf Moor until 2017.

Extension: Defender Kieran Trippier has penned a new three-year deal at the club until 2017

The 23-year-old has been in talks with the Clarets about penning since May, as he played an integral role in Burnley securing promotion to the Premier League.

Trippier featured in 41 of their 46 Championship games as Sean Dyche's side finished second on 93 points behind league winners Leicester City.

Trippier's impressive performances have seen him named the Championshipâ€™s best right back for the last two seasons amidst interest from Arsenal, Newcastle and Southampton.

However, the former Manchester City starlet's new deal looks likely to ward off his potential suitors.
