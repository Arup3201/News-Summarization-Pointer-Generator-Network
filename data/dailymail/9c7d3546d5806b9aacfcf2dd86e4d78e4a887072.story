Eurozone leaders must prepare for the break up of the single currency, the Finnish foreign minister has said.

In an attack on the faltering Euro, Erkki Tuomioja said the that other countries were planning for a collapse.

The senior politician warned that there was only a limited amount of time that rich smaller countries such as Finland could continue paying for profligate southern neighbours.

Criticism: Finnish foreign minister Erkki Tuomioja, left, said he does not trust Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank (ECB)

And in a stinging personal attack on ECB boss Mario Draghi, he said he 'did not trust' the clique of leaders pushing for fiscal union.

The incendiary comments will stoke tensions with other eurozone leaders who will meet in October to consider Greece's finances.

And British politicians whose calls for independence from the European Union are likely to seize on the calls from a leading figure for a break up.

Mr Tuomioja told the Daily Telegraph that Finnish officials have prepared for the break up of the single currency with an 'operational plan for any eventuality.'

'It is not something that anybody - even the True Finns (a Eurosceptic opposition party) - are advocating in Finland, let alone the government. But we have to be prepared,' Tuomioja said.

He said that it was 'only a matter of time' before a break up.

Mr Tuomioja said that Finnish officials have put in place a plan for the break-up. He added that 'this is what people everywhere' are thinking.

And he slammed those who believe that the cost of a break up would cost more in the short and medium term than the billions being spent to keep the ailing single curreny on its feet.

He said: 'Our officials, like everybody else and like every general staff, have some sort of operational plan for any eventuality.

'This is what people are thinking about everywhere. But there is a consensus that a euro zone break-up would cost more in the short-run or medium-run than managing the crisis.'

City observers believe that Britain might experience a drop in output of just two per cent.

The comments come ahead of a meeting with Greek officials in October when EU and IMF inspectors will report back on the parlous state of the indebted countries public finances.

Greece is pleading with more time to ram through austerity measures against fierce resistance from politicians and voters, but its lenders want to see sweeping reform.

Prime Minister Antonis Samaras is set to demand a two-year extension to the timetable for cuts required as a condition of the country’s bailouts when he meets German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande next week.

The Greek government is struggling to find another £9billion of cuts – around 5 per cent of its GDP – for 2013 and 2014.

The austerity measures are required under the deal thrashed out with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which have bailed out Greece.

The country has two colossal bailouts, including a £100billion handout as recently as March.

German officials have made  it clear that they have no intention of giving extra money to Athens since German taxpayers are furious that they keep being expected to bail out a nation where workers are less productive and retire earlier.

Mr Tuomioja said that Eurozone countries could cut off lending which would lead to a default. But he added that ultimately it was down to Greece whether they left the currency.

Mr Tuomioja is part of a coalition government of six parties. But taxpayers disillusioned with paying out large amounts to prop up the eurozone are becoming increasingly restless and turning to eurosceptic parties.

Timo Soini, head of the Finns Party which won 19 per cent of votes at the last election, said voters were 'angry'.

He added: 'Either the south or the north will 
break away because this currency straitjacket is causing misery for 
millions and destroying Europe’s future,

'It is a total catastrophe. We are 
going to run out of money the way we are going. But nobody in Europe 
wants to be first to get out of the euro and take all the blame.'

Meanwhile, Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, 
chairman of the Finnish parliament’s Grand Committee on Europe, said 
that there was a time limit to how long bailouts could continue.

'There is a feeling on the street that
 there has to be a limit. I can’t say whether it is 10pc of GDP, or 
what. It’s not written. But it is obvious that a small country can’t 
help big countries eternally.'

With Britain's economy tied to the plight of the eurozone - its biggest trading partner - any changes are likely to have significant knock-on effect.

Bank of England policymaker Martin Weale said this week that the eurozone was ‘the biggest source of uncertainty’ in the economy.
