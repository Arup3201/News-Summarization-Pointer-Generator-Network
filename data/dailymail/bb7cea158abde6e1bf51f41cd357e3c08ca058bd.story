Alex Salmond will tomorrow face one of the biggest tests of his political career as he prepares for a TV showdown that he must win to have any hope of referendum victory.

The First Minister is under intense pressure going into the STV debate, with a new poll revealing that only a quarter of No voters expect Mr Darling to win the contest.

Failure to land a killer blow could end Mr Salmond's hopes of splitting the United Kingdom, and he is receiving help from taxpayer-funded civil servants and a lifestyle guru in a last throw of the dice before the referendum.

Campaign leaders in both camps are taking the two-hour TV programme very seriously, right down to the colour of tie the two politicians should wear, and the broadcaster is hoping for an audience in seven figures. However, experts have warned such programmes rarely reshape the political landscape.

As an uneasy truce for the Commonwealth Games comes to an end, there will now be open warfare between both sides for the final few weeks of the referendum battle, with families set to be bombarded by mailshots costing taxpayers more than £850,000.

Time is running out for the SNP, with a new poll for The Scottish Mail on Sunday showing Unionist campaign's lead has increased slightly in recent days.

The findings are a massive humiliation for Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who used a Sunday newspaper interview yesterday to claim that Scotland's stunning success in the Commonwealth Games could give the Yes campaign the 'momentum' to win the referendum. 

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg last night accused her of 'sullying' the Games.

AT a Commonwealth Games dominated by the 'photobomb', Alex Salmond should have been on high alert.

An England fan mocked the First Minister of Scotland by waving the St George's Cross behind his head as he watched Tom Daley compete in the diving. 

It was a lighthearted reference to Mr Salmond's stunt last year, when he waved the Saltire behind David Cameron's head at the Wimbledon finals.

The prank comes just six weeks before the Scottish independence referendum.

In fact, only 12 per cent of those surveyed said Glasgow 2014 had made them more inclined to vote Yes, but four-fifths of that number said they were planning to vote for independence in the first place.

The Survation study found more than 80 per cent said the Games have made no difference to how they would vote and 7 per cent said it would make them more inclined to vote No.

Overall, the poll shows that 40 per cent of Scots plan to vote Yes - down one point since last month - with no change for the level of support for No at 46 per cent.

The poll also found that only 11 per cent of voters expect Mr Darling to win tomorrow's TV debate, with 37 per cent backing Mr Salmond. Among Yes voters, 69 per cent said they backed the First Minister, while just 24 per cent of No supporters said they believe Mr Darling will emerge victorious.

Alan Schroeder, associate professor at Northeastern University School of Journalism in Boston and author of Presidential Debates, said: 'While debates make great political theatre, they don't necessarily have the power to reshape the political landscape. 

'Whatever happens on Tuesday, there is too much at stake for Scots voters to let two hours of televised combat determine their future.' 

Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University said: 'It's clearly true the Yes side need it to make a difference. 

'All Alistair Darling, frankly, needs to do is try and hang on to what he's got. I would say to him, play to type and make this as boring as possible.' 

It is understood Mr Salmond has preparing for the debate for around a week, enlisting the help of Claire Howell, a psychologist more used to dealing with Premiership football teams.

Asked if taxpayer-funded civil servants have been involved in the preparation, a spokesman for the Scottish Government said: 'This is a standard media event. Alex Salmond was invited as First Minister and has the normal office support.'

Better Together campaign director Blair McDougall said: 'The pressure is on the First Minister to finally give people honest answers to fundamental questions when he debates with Alistair Darling.

'The Commonwealth Games had nothing to do with the referendum.'

Miss Sturgeon said: 'I do think the momentum is with us. I think [the Games] will inevitably leave a feelgood factor.'

But speaking during a visit to Edinburgh, Mr Clegg said: 'I think it was very gauche of Nicola Sturgeon to try and extract political advantage from the Commonwealth Games.

'The Commonwealth Games is a wonderful festival and it really shouldn't be distorted or sullied by the politics of the SNP.'

Mr Salmond responded: 'Nick Clegg describing anybody else as gauche - that must be one of the quotes of the year.

'I'm not really annoyed by this. My self-denying ordinance and Nicola's ends tomorrow and then there's time enough to take on Nick Clegg or anyone else.'
