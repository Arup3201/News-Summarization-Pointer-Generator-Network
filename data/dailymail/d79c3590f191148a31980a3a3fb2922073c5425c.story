Children in Canada as young as six will learn about the age of consent while eight-year-olds will introduced to the ideas of same-sex relationships.

The topics will be discussed as part of a revamped sex-education curriculum in the province of Ontario that hasn't been updated for 17 years - long before the invention of the smartphone.

Parents have been voicing their unhappiness at some of the topics on the agenda with some threatening to pull their children out of class on the grounds that it is 'too early' for such discussions to take place.

However, the new curriculum actually brings Ontario in line with other Canadian provinces.

Now, listen! Education Minister Liz Sandals (pictured) says Ontario kids as young as six will learn about consent while eight-year-olds will be taught about same-sex relationships under the revamped curriculum

Update: The document – last updated in 1998 before smartphone were invented – brings Ontario in line with other provinces

'The world had changed a lot in the last 15 years. Concepts such as smartphones, SnapChat and sexting were not familiar to anyone, let alone students,' Education Minister Liz Sandals told a  news conference.

'Today, we live in a digital and interconnected world where information is literally at our fingertips around the clock. Students have instant access to quite explicit information from unreliable, inaccurate and often offensive sources. This is why it's so important to ensure that our children have the right information.'

In first grade - age six and seven, students will learn how to understand non-verbal signals like facial expressions and tone of voice, as well as the proper names for body parts.

Students in second grade will learn about the stages of development and related bodily changes along with the concept that 'no means no.' 

Lesson plan: Grade 1 students will learn how to understand non-verbal signals like facial expressions and tone of voice, as well as the proper names for body parts

Syllabus: Children in Grades 4 and up will learn more about the dangers of online bullying and of posting or sharing sexual images, while specific lessons on the dangers of sexting will come in Grade 7

By Grade 3 (age eight and nine), students will learn about same-sex relationships, in an effort to help children with two moms or two dads feel their families are just like everyone else's, provincial officials say.

Children in Grades 4 and up will learn more about the dangers of online bullying and of posting or sharing sexual images, while specific lessons on the dangers of sexting will come in Grade 7 - age 12 and 13. 

Students in Grade 6 will be taught about masturbation and 'gender expression,' while kids in Grades 7 and 8 will discuss contraception, anal and oral sex, preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.

Education minister Liz Sandals says she realized some believe it is too early but doesn't believe many will ban their kids from attending the classes.

'Given that we haven't had hoards of people withdrawing from the public education system given what's already in the curriculum, to be perfectly honest, I don't anticipate that affect now,' she told Global News.

The new curriculum pays particular attention to  gender identify and teaches children from a very young age that they may not be the gender of their body and that there may be six genders.

The government is also publishing online parents' guides to the new curriculum to help them integrate their conversations at home with what will be taught in the classroom.

'Peers, romantic partners or even strangers can pressure or coerce a young person to participate in sexting,' the parents' guide to the sexting portion of the curriculum says. 'Once a person sends a sext, they lose control of it.'

Children in Grades 1 through 3 will learn about 'respectful communications,' while those in 4 to 6 will learn about 'the risks of posting or sharing sexual images or information.'

The Ontario Physical and Health Education Association called the curriculum update long overdue and cautioned critics against overreacting.

The updated curriculum will be in place for the start of classes in September. 

Planned Parenthood praised the inclusion of consent in the revised curriculum, the lessons about online activities, as well as the decision to teach about puberty earlier, switching to grade 4 from grade 5.

Grade 1: Identify body parts, including genitalia, using correct terminology. Recognize caring and exploitative behaviors.
