Thousands of people have flocked to the spot where President John F. Kennedy was shot for a solemn commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his assassination.

Crowds gathered along the same route through Dallas that the president's motorcade passed when shots rang out on November 22, 1963.

Today's event will feature brief remarks by the mayor, the tolling of church bells and readings from the president's speeches by author David McCullough.

The flags in Dallas are flying at half mast today as the city holds a memorial service in honor of the 50th anniversary of President Kennedy's assassination

Moment of silence: The crowd of thousands bowed their heads out of respect at 12.30pm local time

Emotional: Many Americans, including Barbara Clark, vividly remember where they were when they heard that President Kennedy had been shot on November 22, 1963

About
 5,000 tickets were issued for the free ceremony in Dealey Plaza, which 
is flanked by the Texas School Book Depository building where sniper Lee
 Harvey Oswald perched on the sixth floor.

The
 U.S. Naval Academy Men's Glee Club will perform in a nod to Kennedy's 
military service and there will be an Air Force flyover.

It is a reverential approach that will be mirrored in Boston, where the JFK Library and Museum will open a small exhibit of never-before-displayed items from Kennedy's state funeral and host a musical tribute that isn't open to the public.

In Washington, President Obama will meet privately at the White House with leaders and volunteers from the Kennedy-established Peace Corps program. 

Legacy: John F. Kennedy was the most popular president in the 20th Century, and he was assassinated during a campaign stop in Texas on November 22, 1963

High profile guests: Prince Albert of Monaco (right) and his wife Princess Charlene (left) were in attendance

New leading lady: Charlene, like Jackie Kennedy before her, has become something of an international fashion icon

Spectacle: Events in commemoration of the anniversary have been held in Dallas throughout the past year

The President personally visited the 
eternal flame created for Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery on 
Wednesday alongside Michelle Obama, former President Clinton and former 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

A
 number of members of the Kennedy family- including Caroline's son Jack 
Schlossberg- were in attendance, and he went on to speak at a formal 
dinner that night that was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the
 Medal of Freedom- an initiative launched by President Kennedy.

The committee convened by current 
Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings to plan the city's event wanted to focus 'in a
 positive way more on the legacy of President Kennedy,' said Ron Kirk, a
 former mayor and member of the panel. 

Numerous
 events were held around Dallas this year to mark the milestone 
anniversary, including panels with those who were there that day, 
special concerts and museum exhibits.

The spot: A museum now occupies the space that used to be the Texas Book Depository, and this is the window on the sixth floor that was Oswald's hiding spot

Clear shot: Lee Harvey Oswald was positioned in the Sixth floor of the Texas Book Depository, (the building on the left) when he fired at the motorcade

Moving on: In preparation for today's celebration, road crews on Thursday repaved the area of Elm Street where the President was shot

Through the rain: Thousands are expected to line the route of the motorcade that President Kennedy's car was going along as he was shot

Moments from death: President John F. Kennedy, his wife Jackie sit side by side, as they ride through Dallas moments before Kennedy was assassinated, November 22, 1963

As press aide for Governor John Connally, Julian Read was in a media bus several vehicles behind the presidential limousine.

After
 the gunshots, he watched as the vehicle, carrying the mortally wounded 
Kennedy and injured governor, sped away. Read released a book this year 
recounting his experience and has attended several of the events, which 
he called cathartic.

'Even though there are all those 
melancholy thoughts, the way it's shaping up ... gives me more of a 
comfort than any time since 1963,' said Read, who will be at the 
official ceremony Friday.

The
 Coalition on Political Assassinations, a group that believes Kennedy's 
death was part of a conspiracy, usually gathers on the plaza's 'grassy 
knoll' for a moment of silence each November 22.

Since it'll be blocked off 
this year, executive director John Judge - who first came to Dealey 
Plaza for the fifth anniversary of JFK's death in 1968 - says he's 
reached a 'livable' agreement with the city.

The final trip: Jackie and Jack were all smiles when they arrived in Dallas, not knowing what lay ahead

Warm reception: Texas was a difficult state for Democrats to win but the crowds were encouraging for Kennedy

Unexpected: The convertible that the Kennedys were riding in had been equipped with a glass cover but the President felt he was better able to connect with voters without the barrier

Action: Secret Service agent Clint Hill rushed to the back of the limousine and pushed Mrs Kennedy back in the car after she tried to grab a piece of her husband's skull that had flown off

On display: The limousine that Kennedy was riding in was used by a number of presidents after him but it was eventually retired from the fleet and now is part of an exhibit at The Henry Ford Museum in Michigan

Healing old wounds: A number of tributes have been erected in Dallas over the years, including this landmark marker in Dealey Plaza where the motorcade traveled on that fateful day

The
 group - which plans to wear specially made T-shirts with an image of 
Kennedy's head with a bullet hole and blood and the slogan '50 years in 
denial is enough' - will gather a few blocks away and move to the plaza 
after the official ceremony ends.

President John F. Kennedy's last surviving sibling, 85-year-old Jean Kennedy Smith, has laid a wreath at her brother's grave at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington.

Smith was accompanied Friday morning by about 10 members of the Kennedy family as they marked the 50th anniversary of his assassination in Dallas.

They joined hands for a short prayer in silence and left roses at the grave.

Evidence: Lady Bird Johnson asked if Jackie wanted to change before Lyndon was sworn in as president on Air Force One (pictured) but Jackie responded 'I want them to see what they did to Jack'

Investigation: Conspiracy theories about the assassination, many which persist today. The official version of events concludes that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone and used this bolt-action rifle with a telescopic sight

Heartbreaking: The President's funeral was held on the same day that his son John F. Kennedy Jr turned three, and the little boy is seen here saluting to his father's casket during the funeral

Bagpipes played, a British cavalry officer stood guard and a flame burned steady as it has for the last 50 years at the grave.

A few hundred tourists watched the ceremony, which lasted only a few minutes.

Also today, one of President Kennedy's two granddaughters has paid her respects at the British memorial site in his honor.

A
 stone tablet and ornate garden were dedicated to President Kennedy in 
Runnymede in Berkshire, and a service was held there today on the 50th 
anniversary of his assassination.

Blood lines: Kennedy Smith previously served as the American ambassador to Ireland

Respect: Navy SEALs and mourners came to visit President Kennedy's grave

National movement: Visitors are seen paying their respects on Friday at the eternal flame at President Kennedy's grave in Arlington National Cemetery

The site was unveiled in 1965 by Queen Elizabeth with Jacqueline Kennedy and her two children in tow.

Caroline
 Kennedy's 23-year-old daughter Tatiana Schlossberg was the family 
representative there today and she was accompanied by the American 
ambassador to England.

'We have come here today to honor his 
memory- as this monument does so well- but today is a difficult day 
because it is a reminder of a moment of profound sadness for my family, 
for America and for the world,' she said at the ceremony.

'For me, my grandfather lives in my 
imagination, in his words, and in the lessons he has left with us. 
Throughout my life, I have been able to connect with him through the 
study of history, both by studying his life and by studying the eras and
 patterns that fascinated him.'

In his honor: Tatiana Schlossberg spoke about her connection to her grandfather, former President John F. Kennedy, at a ceremony in Surrey on Friday

Reflection: The stone tablet was dedicated to the assassinated president in 1965, two years after his death

While Caroline's oldest daughter Rose has not been spotted at any
 memorial functions, Jack has served as the family's representative at a
 number of events held in his grandfather's honor in Washington.

He
 and his great aunt Ethel Kennedy, who is the widow of JFK's brother 
Bobby, attended the Medal of Freedom ceremony in the White House on 
Wednesday.

They then accompanied Presidents Obama 
and Clinton to Arlington Ceremony where they paid their respects at the 
eternal flame that Jackie had made in her husband's honor.

Caroline, who is now the sole surviving member of President Kennedy's immediate family, has not participated in any of
 the events leading up to the anniversary of her father's death as she 
is just beginning her tenure as the new American ambassador to Japan.

In Boston, the private
 musical tribute will feature Paul Winter, whose jazz sextet performed 
for Kennedy at the White House, along with a U.S. Navy choir and James 
Taylor.

Other notable guests include Massachusetts Governor Deval Patrick, who is scheduled to read quotes from Kennedy's speeches.

Holding hands: At the Medal of Freedom ceremony Wednesday morning, President Obama called Ethel Kennedy 'one of my favorite people' and she was accompanied by both Mr Obama and Mr Clinton as they headed to the grave

Heir apparent: Caroline's youngest child, Jack Schlossberg, is the only living male relative that is a direct descendant of JFK

Family duties: Jack spoke before President Obama at a dinner held in his grandfather's honor for the Medal of Freedom winners on Wednesday night in Washington

A world away: Caroline Kennedy has not been present at any of the memorial services for her father and she has just started her new job as the American ambassador to Japan

A different family: On Thursday, Caroline met with American military personnel stationed in Tokyo
