Freed: Karen Matthews has been released from jail after serving just half her eight year sentence

Karen Matthews was released from prison yesterday after serving just half of an eight-year sentence for kidnapping her daughter.

Matthews, 36, was nicknamed ‘Britain’s worst mother’ after she hatched a plot to abduct Shannon, then aged nine, in February 2008 in an elaborate attempt to claim a £50,000 reward.

The mother of seven was freed from Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire and taken to a secret location believed to be within 30 miles of her former home in Dewsbury Moor, West Yorkshire.

She now has ambitions to appear on the tacky Jeremy Kyle Show.

Sources said Matthews was given a full makeover including a new hairstyle before her release to prevent her being recognised in the street, and she will now live under an assumed name.

Unlike Maxine Carr, who was jailed after the Soham murders of Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, she has not been given a new identity including a new National Insurance number and passport.

Such a move would have cost the taxpayer £250,000 and required Matthews to keep her real identity a secret.

It is not known if Matthews requested a new identity. But officials were so concerned that she would jeopardise it and her safety by failing to keep it a secret that they ruled it out.

Matthews will use the assumed name when she comes into contact with people in a social setting, but when she is dealing with officialdom she will use her real name and rely on client and patient confidentiality to protect her identity. She will be supported in this by probation officers.

Victim: Shannon Matthews was only nine-years-old when she was abducted, drugged and tied up, just a mile from her home where she was held for 24 days

Matthews, whose children are now in 
care, will remain on licence for the rest of her sentence. During that 
time she must observe strict rules or face being returned to jail.

Last night, as she was warned to stay
away from her former home on a rundown estate, it was revealed that she
hopes to take part in the Jeremy Kyle Show on ITV1.

The programme, in which people argue 
about their tangled love lives and other problems in front of a baying 
studio audience, has previously been likened to ‘bear-baiting’.

Boarded up: The home of Karen Matthews in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, was the focal point for the 3-week hunt for Shannon

A former friend, Natalie Brown, who 
was with Matthews when she admitted her part in the kidnap plot, said: 
‘As far as I’m aware, from what’s been said, Karen still believes she 
didn’t do anything wrong.

‘She wants to do a lie detector test 
to prove that she didn’t do anything wrong and that there were other 
people involved, but she won’t tell us who.’

Susan Howgate, a cousin of Matthews, 
said: ‘She wants to do this lie-detector and go on Jeremy Kyle. And 
she’s saying other people are involved.’

Accomplice: Michael Donovan kept Shannon stuffed in the drawer of a divan bed at his home for 24 days

Miss Howgate added: ‘I don’t want 
nothing to do with her no more because she’s ruined our lives and the 
rest of the family. So if I ever see her out on the streets, I’ll never 
speak to her.’

After her release, Matthews was taken
to a safe house where probation officers will monitor her around the 
clock over the coming days.

A source said: ‘She won’t be allowed 
out on her own and won’t be allowed to sign on like other offenders. 
She’ll be held in secure conditions to make sure that she does not come 
to any harm.’

Matthews and her accomplice, Michael Donovan, 44, sparked a £3.2million police hunt when they kidnapped Shannon from her home.

A tearful Matthews made TV appeals 
pleading with her daughter’s abductor to set her free and hundreds of 
local peoplehelped search for the girl.

Shannon was found by police 24 days 
later in Donovan’s flat a mile away, hidden in a compartment under a 
bed. Donovan, who was also jailed for eight years, was released last 
week.

A spokesman for ITV said: ‘We have no plans to invite Karen Matthews onto the Jeremy Kyle Show.’
