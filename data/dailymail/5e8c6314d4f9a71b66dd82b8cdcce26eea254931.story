He has admitted that maths isn’t his strong point, but it seems Prince Harry worked a little magic yesterday.

The 26-year-old closed a foreign exchange deal worth £15.5billion at the BGC Partners charity day in London's Canary Wharf.

And to celebrate the prince reacted by striking a Tommy Cooper-style comedy pose.

Harry attended the event on behalf of Sentebale, the charity he co-founded to support vulnerable children and orphans in the southern African country of Lesotho.

He took to the telephone to complete 
the deal between Barclays London and a European counter-party based on 
projected currency values between September 13 and 14.

The
fundraising day was established by BGC, a global inter-broker dealer, 
in memory of staff from its sister company, investment bank Cantor 
Fitzgerald, who died during the 9/11 attacks in New York.

The firm lost 658 employees - more even than the New York Fire Department.

The victims of the attack were commemorated in both New York and London yesterday to mark the 10th anniversary of the attacks.

Robert
Sully, a broker on the foreign exchange desk who handed the phone to 
the prince, described the royal's performance as 'brilliant'.

Harry
looked a little bemused as he chatted away to a trader from Barclays on
the other end of the phone using the complicated language of the 
trading floor.

Mr Sully added: 'We told Harry to say '28 year choice' which means you can buy or sell.'

Money magic: BGC Partners traders give the 
prince a steer as he negotiates the deal, which beat the previous record
of 17billion euros set by his brother the Duke of Cambridge last 
December

The planned trade went through and the BGC trader described it as the biggest forward foreign exchange deal in history.

The prince beat the record set by his brother the Duke of Cambridge last December who completed a foreign exchange trade worth 17 billion euros during a charity day organised by City firm ICAP, an inter-dealer broker.

Harry was joined on BGC's trading floor by celebrities from the worlds of film, television, sport, politics, fashion and music to raise millions for 29 UK charities.

Amongst those taking phone calls to broker deals with clients were Kelly Brook, Sophie Ellis Bextor, Chris Evans, Ronnie Wood, Ray Winstone, Sir Terry Wogan and London Mayor Boris Johnson.

All revenues generated during the course of the charity day are donated to the 29 good causes.

Prince Harry, who is a trainee Apache helicopter pilot, spent around 40 minutes completing a number of deals and enjoying some banter with the traders who had exchanged their City suits for red rugby tops.

Harry praised the BGC staff during a pause in the trading: 'It's great to see everybody making an effort on Monday morning.'

He added joking and pointing to a group of traders nearby: 'Most of that corner down there have hangovers.'

The royal went on to say: 'Great atmosphere, everybody is wearing rugby shirts except for a few of us in suits.'

Speaking about his charity Sentebale, he added: 'We're doing as much as we can in the time we've got available, but the fact these guys have chosen us as beneficiaries is absolutely fantastic.'

As the prince toured the floor he met model Eva Herzigova who was also trying to complete a deal and the pair exchanged a few words.

Traders barked prices at each other at deafening levels as Prince Harry walked around, and he was followed by a throng of BGC staff eager to take his picture on their camera phones.

Earlier, before arriving on the trading floor, the Prince was taken around a small zoo set up at the City firm to entertain children helped by some of the charities which will benefit from the fundraising.

As he was leaving, Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans arrived and joked with staff about taking the rest of the day off to celebrate their efforts.

He said: 'I just wish you could all knock off and come to the pub.'

Among the charities and good causes benefiting from the day are Barnardo's, Children In Need and Great Ormond Street Hospital.
