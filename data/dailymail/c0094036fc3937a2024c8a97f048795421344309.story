Jordan Axani may be single, but he won't be spending Christmas alone.

The 27-year-old Canadian started an online campaign last month to find someone to take his ex-girlfriend's place on a round-the-world trip they planned back in March. 

The couple's subsequent break-up left him with multiple non-transferable tickets in his ex's name, so he set out to find another Canadian called Elizabeth Gallagher to give the tickets to for free.

And the search was a success. A 23-year-old student and part-time office administrator named Elizabeth Quinn Gallagher, from Nova Scotia, took Axani up on his offer, despite her long-term boyfriend's less than enthusiastic attitude.

Just friends: However, the trip will be completely platonic since Gallagher already has a boyfriend, who is apparently not so pleased to see her leave on a vacation with another man. Pictured above with a man who appears to be her boyfriend on Facebook 

Pick me, pick me! Gallagher tweeted this picture of her Canadian passport when she heard Axani was looking for someone to join him on his epic vacation from New York to New Dehli 

'He understands that I've always wanted to travel so while he's not happy I'm taking off for nearly a month at Christmas with a random guy he's smiling through it,' Gallagher said of her boyfriend, who she plans to purchase a home with. 

Gallagher says she initially thought the trip was 'crazy' but was put at ease after spending hours talking to Axani over the phone. 

'It definitely did seem a little bit creepy at the beginning but now that I talked to him it's less creepy and more awesome,' she said.  

Axani says the trip will be 'strictly platonic' and he's looking forward to jetting out of New York on December 21. 

The original Elizabeth Gallagher: Axani (left) originally planned to spend this Christmas holiday travelling around the world with former girlfriend Elizabeth Gallagher (left). She broke up with him after they bought all of the plane tickets 

Axani and Gallagher will then travel to Milan, Prague, Paris, Bangkok, and New Dehli before returning to Toronto on January 8. 

Because Axani stopped planning the trip when he broke up with his girlfriend, he didn't book any hotels for the trip. 

However, after the story went viral online, Marriott International stepped up to provide Axani and his companion with separate rooms at each stop on their journey. 

Axani plans to document the once-in-a-lifetime trip with a stranger online. 

The experience also opened him up to the realization of how lucky he is to be going on such a trip.

Of the thousands of emails he received in his search, he got one especially touching message from an 8-year-old boy who was going blind and wanted to see the world before losing his vision. 

That message inspired Axani, who works in international real estate, to start an organization with his brother called A Ticket Forward to help people who want to travel but don't have the money.

Axani initially started his search on Reddit last month, posting a plea that said: 'I need your help. You see, in March I booked a fairly wicked trip around the world for this Christmas for my ex and I. 

Desperate: In November, Axani posted this message to Reddit in an attempt to find another Elizabeth Gallagher willing to join him on the trip 

'While our relationship has come to a close, I am still planning on going on the trip and she is not (naturally). 

'And because I hate the idea of a ticket around the world going to waste, I am looking for a Canadian named Elizabeth Gallagher who could use the ticket.

'Anyone familiar with with the archaic system that is modern air travel will know that a name change on a ticket is damn near impossible. 

'Moreover, the flights were purchased during a massive blow-up on Priceline and were frankly so cheap and on so many different airlines that they're not worth the headache or money to cancel.' 

Before potential candidates started applying to accompany him, he laid some ground rules, but also offered to buy the first glass of wine before jetting off.

Giving: The campaign opened up Axani to how lucky he was to be taking such a vacation, and he has since launched a charity to help other people travel who can't afford it 

He wrote: 'I am not looking for anything in return. I am not looking for companionship, romance, drugs, a trade, or to take selfies with you in front the Christmas Market in Prague. 

'If you feel compelled to toss me a couple hundred bucks, great. Really the only thing I ask for is that you enjoy this trip and that it bring you happiness.

'We can travel together and see some cool stuff - or not. I'm easy and have no problem with someone taking the tickets and doing their own thing (see ya on the plane!). 

'Embracing the spontaneity of life is more my thing, though, so if you want to travel together (and are not an axe murder) I’m likely game.

'This is for the flights only. In the wake of the breakup I have deferred all further planning for the trip. No hotels, trains or anything have been booked. You're on your own, bucko. Having said that, I will buy the first round of vino at JFK upon departure.'
