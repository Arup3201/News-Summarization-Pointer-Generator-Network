Gloucester have risked sparking a club versus country row with Wales by naming injured hooker Richard Hibbard in their squad to face Harlequins on Friday night. 

The 30-year-old front row was seen leaving the Wales camp in a protective boot on Tuesday evening, after being left out of the 23-man group to play Fiji this weekend.

Hibbard was pulled off 58 minutes into Saturday’s defeat by Australia and his omission by Warren Gatland - who was under no obligation to release the player back to the Premiership club - was seemingly to boost recovery ahead of next weekend’s Test against New Zealand.

Richard Hibbard has been named in Gloucester's squad to face Harlequins on Friday night 

While defensive coach Sean Edwards said the Cherry and Whites were within their rights to select the forward, Sportsmail understands that he was not expected to feature on the bench for Friday night’s Kingsholm fixture.

‘He’s been released back and, like a lot of players who are released back, he’s been selected by his club,’ said Edwards. ‘He didn’t get picked by Wales - not that he was dropped. We just rotated the three hookers and he had a bit of a bad foot as well.

‘It’s sometimes a bit misleading when they have those boots on, because they can be for a minor injury. You see a player with a boot on and you think he’s ruptured his ligaments or broken his foot or something. But sometimes they are just on for a couple of days as protective measures. Not being a medical man myself I’m not quite sure how he was.’

Hibbard makes a charge with ball in hand against the Wallabies at the Millennium Stadium last Saturday 

Edwards denied claims that it was part of a deal with Gloucester to make Hibbard available for the fourth Test against South Africa; similar to the agreement Gatland made with Racing Metro over second row Luke Charteris.

Ospreys hooker Scott Baldwin has filled Hibbard’s place in the starting XV, which has eight new faces for the second Test at the Millennium Stadium. Rhys Priestland is promoted to the line-up following an injury to fly half Dan Biggar - and Edwards has told the minority who booed Priestland last week that such vitriol has no place in the game. 

As defence coach, Edwards will be keen to eradicate the missed tackles that let the Wallabies in for two of their three tries last weekend. 

Wales coach Warren Gatland omitted Lions hooker Hibbard from his squad to face Fiji on Saturday 

But he has also called on his players to be more aggressive in defence – although Jamie Roberts faces a huge task against 19-stone centre Nemani Nadolo – and highlighted a period of ‘passive’ play that allowed Foley to seal the victory with a late drop goal.

‘We were passive in the build-up to the drop-goal,’ said Edwards. ‘We defended for 22 phases, which in itself is good defence, but we pride ourselves on our attacking style of defence and actually trying to take yardage off the opposition.

‘We probably conceded 18-20 yards in 22 phases, which equates to about a yard every phase, which is something we have definitely been working on more this week. We’ve been working on blasting hard off the line and really dominating those collisions.
