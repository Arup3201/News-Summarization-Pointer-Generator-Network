Multi-millionaire Alex Langsam is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels

This is the multi-millionaire cashing in on a Home Office decision to use one of the country’s largest privately owned hotel chains to house asylum seekers.

In a deal costing the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds a week, Alex Langsam is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels.

His firm, Britannia Hotels, owns the three properties in Folkestone and Bournemouth that were recently found to be providing ‘full board’ accommodation for hundreds of taxpayer-funded asylum seekers.

Now the Daily Mail has learned that another of 76-year-old Mr Langsam’s hotels – four miles from Gatwick airport – is housing 100 asylum seekers.

Many are from Eritrea and Somalia with others from Arab states or Eastern Europe. Paying guests – who were using the 130-bedroom Russ Hill Hotel near the Surrey village of Charlwood as a ‘stay and fly’ hotel – were stunned to find the group staying for free alongside them.

One guest, who was paying £50 for a pre-flight stay and then £6 a day to park her car in the hotel grounds, said: ‘It is more like a hostel than a hotel – I will never stay here again after this experience.’

As she spoke more than 70 asylum seekers sat on chairs and on the floor in the reception area and lounge – while others went for walks in the sprawling grounds.

Eritrean-born Saddiq said he had been in Britain for only a few weeks and was moved to the hotel from another Britannia property – thought to be in Bournemouth.

‘I am grateful to the Home Office for paying for my room,’ he said. ‘We get fed at the hotel and it is good to be here but the rooms are not so big. Some people have to share.’ While the arrangement has clearly come as a surprise to paying guests, it appears to be providing a lucrative income for Mr Langsam, the founder, owner and chief executive of Britannia.

He is said to have amassed a personal fortune of £70million and lives in a ten-bedroomed former hotel worth more than £3million in a leafy Cheshire village close to his headquarters.

It is near a property once owned by former Manchester United footballer Roy Keane. Mr Langsam’s home is surrounded by carefully-kept gardens featuring marble statues. His two Jaguar cars and a Bentley sit on the driveway.

He also has a £400,000 leasehold flat in Didsbury, Manchester.

Business is booming for Britannia despite the fact that some of the group’s hotels have been described as dirty on the TripAdvisor website, where guests post comments about hotels where they have stayed.

His hotel group’s latest figures showed an increased turnover of 25 per cent to almost £70million – with profits of nearly £12million posted last year.

Last year the company was fined £160,000 after exposing guests and construction workers to a risk from asbestos found in the Grand Burstin hotel in Folkestone. It admitted breaching safety regulations during conversion work in 2010.

The Home Office is thought to be paying around £350 per week for each asylum seeker placed in Britannia’s hotels.

Mr Langsam has expanded the budget hotel chain. It now has 47 hotels offering 9,000 rooms, and three years ago he bought the Pontins holiday camp business.

In 2011/2012 the Home Office spent £150million providing accommodation for asylum seekers. The figure is now likely to nudge £200million.

Judging by reviews posted on TripAdvisor, Britannia is not advertising to paying guests that it houses asylum seekers at the Russ Hill Hotel, near Gatwick. 

One reviewer wrote: ‘We did not expect that the hotel would be full of people who are on a very extended stay and get all of their meals and £10 a day spending money as well!’

Many residents in the village of Charlwood are equally unimpressed with their new neighbours. One woman, who lives yards from the hotel, said: ‘Last weekend we had a large number of men sitting on the verge outside our house and staring at us and our home. It really was quite intimidating.’

Last month the Daily Mail told how the Home Office bussed coachloads of asylum seekers to the three-star Britannia Roundhouse Hotel in Bournemouth where 88 were billeted. 

It then emerged that a further 67 were booked into the Britannia-owned Heathlands Hotel, which is also in Bournemouth, while 130 were at the Grand Burstin Hotel in Folkestone.

Earlier in the month hotel inspectors found 600 asylum seekers crammed into the 98-room Queen’s Hotel in Crystal Palace, South London, with nine people sharing one room. 

It is not owned by Britannia, but many of the asylum seekers were later moved to Bournemouth and Folkestone. It is unclear how many more of Britannia’s 47 hotels are being used for asylum seekers.

Last night neither Britannia Hotels nor Mr Langsam was available for comment.

The Home Office refused to confirm details of its contract with the company.
