A video has surfaced showing two witnesses' incredulous reactions to the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer.

In the video, one of the contractors standing near the scene throws his own hands up in the air  and shouts 'he had his f****** hands in the air' minutes after Brown was gunned down.

Officer Darren Wilson shot dead unarmed 18-year-old Brown on August 9, in an incident that triggered a national debate on race relations and two weeks of widespread protests.

The men's reactions were captured on a cellphone-recorded video obtained by CNN.

One of the men, who spoke to CNN under condition of anonymity, told the broadcaster he saw Brown running away from a police car.

Brown then put his hands up and 'the officer was chasing him', he said. He saw Wilson fire a shot at Brown while his back was turned.

The other contractor said he saw Brown's 'brains come out of his head,' adding 'his hands were up.'

An autopsy commissioned by Brown's family concluded that he was shot six times, twice in the head. 

It comes two days after a judge denied a request to release Brown's juvenile records.

Following the decision, angry residents of Ferguson then stormed a city council meeting to protest how police have handled the shooting of the 18-year-old and the unrest that followed.

CNN's new video has surfaced as multiple investigations into both the shooting and Ferguson police force's operating methods have been opened.

A Justice Department investigation will scrutinize the organisation's patterns of stops, arrests and use of force, as well as the training the officers receive. 

In announcing the probe, Attorney General Eric Holder cited a 'history of mistrust' between officers and the residents of Ferguson.

He said: 'As a result of this history, and after of a review of documented allegations of incidents, we have determined that there's cause for the Justice Department to open an investigation of whether there is a pattern and practice of officers in Ferguson violating constitutional rights or federal laws.'

The community's anger at the shooting resulted in chaos on city streets, with militarized police using tear gas and rubber bullets in an attempt to contain daily riots, vandalism and disorder.

The police response to the protests also sparked a national debate on the militarization of police forces

Black community leaders say black residents endure a pattern of harassment and abuse at the hands of the mostly-white police force and claim Brown's shooting was just the most egregious example.

The Ferguson Police Department is also conducting an internal review of the case.

Police have said Brown was shot after a scuffle that broke out after officer Wilson told the teen and a friend to move out of the street and onto a sidewalk.

Supporters of Wilson have defended the officer's actions by saying he was threatened by Brown, who was 6-foot-4 and 300 pounds and was trying to go for the officer's gun.

Witnesses, including Brown's friend, told the news media that Brown had his hands up and was surrendering when he was gunned down. Many members of the community claim Brown's shooting was a cold-blooded murder.

The department also released details of a robbery in which video footage showed Brown stealing a box of cigars prior to his confrontation with Wilson.

His family released a statement in response, in which they condemned the information release which they said was 'intended to assassinate the character of their son, following such a brutal assassination of his person in broad daylight.'

Meanwhile, more protesters were arrested yesterday after attempting to shut down a local highway.

The demonstrators were hoping to block the Interstate 70 entrance ramp in the St. Louis suburb, when they were halted by a wall of police officers, KMOV reports.

Another demonstrator is restrained by police following yesterday's protest, which was an attempt to get Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Darren Wilson

The aim was to get Missouri Governor Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor in the case against Darren Wilson.

Highway Patrol Sergeant Al Nothum said that 35 people were arrested, most on charges of unlawful assembly. 

Mr Nothum said protesters hurled rocks, concrete blocks, bricks and bottles, leading to four charges of assault on a law enforcement officer. 

The Missouri Highway Patrol warned protesters: 'Attempting to block an interstate highway is unsafe and unacceptable.'
