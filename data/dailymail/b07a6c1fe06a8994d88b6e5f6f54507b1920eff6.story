Bronca, Diego Maradona called it. The emotion was his driving force throughout his career. Marcela Mora y Araujo, translator of his autobiography El Diego, described it as representing ‘anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent’.

It would appear Luis Suarez, perhaps the player most like Maradona at this World Cup, is motivated by bronca, too.

Nothing else explains his mood swings, his brilliant destructiveness, the intensity of his creative blaze and sudden self-immolation.

Passion: Luis Suarez seems to be driven by an emotion referred to by Diego Maradona as bronca

Driven: Maradona claimed bronca represented his 'anger, fury, hatred, resentment and bitter discontent'

Suarez was angry long before he sank his teeth into defender Giorgio Chiellini. He was angry after defeating England the week before, angry on the eve of the final group meeting with Italy, too.

He used every opportunity to rail against his critics, his detractors in England, those who dare to suggest that football is better without racism, cheating and acts of aggravated bodily harm. It is as if he possesses dual personalities.

There is the Suarez whom team-mates recognise, and he is a universally popular figure. This Suarez gives selflessly for his team, is a disciplined and dedicated trainer and a quiet family man, still devoted to his childhood sweetheart and their young family.

Then there is the Suarez possessed by bronca, uncontrolled, without boundaries, illogical. Viewed together this pair make no sense, Jekyll and Hyde but without the potions.

It does not follow that Suarez can depart from reality into a state where he is moved to bite another human being.

It does not follow that this behaviour is repeated, that it has a pattern immune to censure or judgement. What Suarez does baffles all understanding. It is as if he is, in the truest sense of the phrase, out of his mind.

If it were possible to review a substantial library of great and important goals that had been scored by virtue of biting an opponent, it would not make his behaviour correct, but it would at least begin to explain the motivation.

If there were games that had been won only because of occlusive biting, there could at least be understanding. We do not condone diving or simulation in the area, either, but we accept it can get results.

Yet what Suarez does can only have a negative effect. At worst, he is sent off, or banned, if spotted. At best? Well, what is the positive outcome here?

Chiellini was not going to become incapacitated, unable to continue due to his injuries. Biting, while horrible, is in fact a rather inefficient way of gaining advantage over an opponent. The best Suarez could hope for was shock.

Yet England’s defenders also looked pretty shocked in Sao Paulo, and no teeth were bared to achieve that outcome.

Suarez is at his least dangerous when he opens his mouth. It is his feet, and his brain, that terrify, combining to provide the movement, instinct and clinical nature that are his most effective qualities. Biting, Suarez is almost worthless.

Shocking: Chiellini displays bite marks on his shoulder after the incident, but the referee wasn't swayed

So why do it? Any mental health professional will say it is a spontaneous act. Suarez did not go into the match with Italy thinking he would bite Chiellini, given the chance. It is also an opportunist crime, and born out of fear.

Suarez has a history of biting, but usually when the game is not going well. He was murdering England, and behaved impeccably, he was frustrated by Italy when the bronca overwhelmed him.

This conforms to type. Suarez was getting little joy against Chelsea the day he bit Branislav Ivanovic, and Liverpool were losing at the time. The Ajax match in which he bit Otman Bakkal of PSV Eindhoven in 2010 ended in a 0-0 draw.

Psychologists will also say Suarez bites when he feels threatened or is unnerved by circumstances. There is no record of an attack being perpetrated when his team are winning, or even in a game in which he has already scored.

This excuses nothing, of course, because what English football has found is that Suarez does not respond to patience, understanding and our most decent human emotions. He responds to a big stick.

He had his greatest season in the last campaign for Liverpool, following a 10-match ban for biting Ivanovic.

Yet in the loving arms of la celeste he goes unchallenged, unquestioned, unchecked. Uruguay are Suarez-dependent. They need him like an addict needs his fix. Nothing he does can be wrong. And Suarez indulged is Suarez unhinged. That is why we are back here again.

Cristiano Ronaldo has found it close to impossible to affect Portugal at this World Cup, yet Uruguay have been driven to eliminate England, and then Italy, by Suarez. He is the nearest in talent to Maradona here in his ability to singlehandedly drive a team.

The return is that nothing he does can be wrong in their eyes. Uruguay’s part in this Faustian pact is that they will defend the indefensible, endorse the ludicrous and feed  paranoia, a perverse victim mentality, that is plainly unhealthy.

Oscar Tabarez is a hugely respected coach on the South American continent, who even Maradona refers to as el maestro, yet he, too, was moved to foolishness by his refusal to acknowledge that Suarez had done wrong.

Tabarez claimed the allegations were a conspiracy, conducted by people ‘hiding in trees’. That Suarez’s act was beamed live across the world escaped him. Diego Lugano, Uruguay’s captain, said Chiellini was a snitch and had shown the referee an old scar.

Even those from Uruguay who are here, ostensibly, as impartial observers failed to locate their critical faculties.

There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about England’s controversial World Cup goal in 1966.

There was no front-page controversy over Suarez in Uruguay and the website of the main football television network in the country, Tenfield, carried instead a bizarre rant about England’s controversial World Cup goal in 1966.

‘It would be good if these English people who are worried and are pushing to have Suarez suspended can explain how they won the World Cup in 1966 with a goal that wasn’t a goal, one that bounced in front of the goal-line after hitting the underside of the crossbar,’ said Tenfield’s correspondent, utilising logic that could have explained Suarez’s bite on Ivanovic away as a response to a tackle by Chopper Harris in 1968.

Sunderland manager Gus Poyet, a former Uruguay international with 26 caps, attempted to explain the different cultures before the World Cup began by saying that where Suarez comes from there is not such a strong ethical pressure around a sporting contest.

‘I know that for you a handball on the goal-line is cheating,’ he said, ‘but not for us. It’s part of the game. If I’m the last man and you’re running and I pull your shirt and you go down and I get sent off — is that cheating? No, it’s not cheating.’

Yet, around Suarez, such moral ambivalence can have dangerous consequences. The hangers-on and ego-fluffers amid his employers and advisers conspire to indulge Suarez the monster, while only the quiet men of the FA’s disciplinary arm have succeeded in controlling those animalistic excesses.

Going? English football will be missed if he decides to leave Liverpool in the summer

Everything he rails against in English football — the critics, the press, those who decry a destructive attitude he confuses indulgently with desire — are actually all that is good for him. Pandered to by his coach, his grateful team-mates and a slavish, cheerleading media, he is then set on a course of self-destruction.

That is the Suarez irony. He feels he punished England with the goals that ended this country’s World Cup ambitions. He feels he was avenged. Yet avenged for what, exactly?

Everything he despises about the English game is what keeps him in check. If Suarez plays no further part in this World Cup, or in football for many months to come, it will be because he failed to learn the lessons of his brief exposure to the standards of the English game.

If only he knew it, we’re the best friends he has.
