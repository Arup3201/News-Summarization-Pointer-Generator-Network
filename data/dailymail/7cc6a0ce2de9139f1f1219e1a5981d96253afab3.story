When TOWIE star Bobby Norris walked out into the Marbella sunshine with his barely-there man pants on, the whole world gaped in awe. How does it stay up? Is this legal in public? What would Borat say?

Pictures of the asymmetric 'swimsuit' went viral, with celebrities such as Paris Hilton and David Walliams even tweeting about the daring summer look.

And now, you can get your hands on the ‘Sirius Schlong Thong’ because the star of The Only Way Is Essex has brought out his own range.

Coming to a store near you! Bobby Norris from The Only Way Is Essex modelled his new 'Sirius Schlong Thong' on This Morning after announcing that he will be selling them on his online store

Available in black, purple, fuscia, camouflage and white, the reality TV star is selling the quirky garment for £10 on his official website.

The self-proclaimed tanning addict has bought out the thong to help ‘banish those white parts’ and help customers to ‘be the centre of attention at all the pool parties', he says.

Bobby made an appearance on This Morning to model the asymmetrical man thong, which is also known as C-shape G-string.

He's even planning on adding more style to the range, including ‘Jolly Holiday’, ‘The Crown Jewels’ and ‘Monkey Business’.

The new range of thongs forms part of his Sirius Collection, a range of unisex T-shirts that support a local animal shelter close to his heart.

Speaking about the range, he said: 'My first line with the Sirius Collection comes from a passion to create really cool and design led pieces that appeal to everyone of all ages.

'I have been hands on in developing the idea, working with the animal sanctuary and leading the designers. I feel proud to have developed a range that reflects my style and ensures the wearer "shines" standing out from a crowd when wearing them.'

It's been a tough week for Bobby after beau Harry Derbidge admitted to sleeping with his ex-boyfriend behind Bobby’s back.

‘I’ve 
found messages on Harry’s phone,’ Bobby told Ricky and Jess on the ITV2 show.

‘I need to know what happened in Tenerife with your ex,’ says Bobby when he confronts Harry at the club.

‘Are you having a joke?’ Harry said.

Bobby retorts: ‘Of course I’m not, this ain’t a comedy club.’

‘We met up for dinner, no kissing nothing, you are the love of my life,’ Harry said.

‘I’m not 
Stevie Wonder, I’ve got two eyes and I’ve seen the text messages,’ Bobby
 said. He leaves to have some time alone with Harry remaining with tears
 tears in his eyes.

And
 as scenes from next week’s episode are previewed, Derbidge can be seen 
admitting to Bobby that he did in fact, cheat on him with his ex in 
Tenerife.
