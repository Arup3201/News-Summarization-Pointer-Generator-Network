Huge legal bill: Dr Kathleen Baker, 72, who has spent 50 years fighting with another pensioner over the ownership of a £2million property in Cornwall

She has spent 50 years locked in a battle over her late father’s estate after it was left to his alleged mistress.

Now, Kathleen Baker has argued that the woman could not have been his lover as he was impotent.

The retired academic, 72, has gone to the High Court to try to force Audrey Line, the owner of Harrogate House in Falmouth, to hand over a share of the spectacular beachfront property.

It is the latest twist in the battle over the £2million home on the Cornish Riviera that has cost Dr Baker hundreds of thousands of pounds in legal fees.

Her father Albert ran and owned a hotel in the town with Miss Line’s mother Norah Duff, with whom he was said to be having an affair in the 1950s.

Since his death in 1961, the pair’s respective daughters have been at loggerheads over who was due what share of the property.

The court heard the row has led to a series of alleged incidents including Miss Line being arrested for unfounded fraud allegations, and Dr Baker ‘rampaging’ through the hotel.

Dr Baker’s father and Norah had set up a company together to run the Palm Beach Hotel in Falmouth.

But a year after his death, his share of the hotel was transferred to her, making her the owner.

She later transferred the ownership to her daughter Audrey, who sold the Palm Beach and bought Harrogate House, a 1920s property that was designed by renowned Cornish architect Alfred Cornelius and overlooks Gyllyngvase Beach.

Dr Baker denies that her father was having an affair and has said that the transfer of his share of the hotel was invalid.

Her barrister, Graham Sinclair, told the High Court in London  she was entitled to ‘trace and follow the value of such shares into the hands of Miss Line’, ultimately, to Harrogate House.

Miss Line, 71, said Dr Baker was ‘in denial’ and was trying to make her homeless.

Her lawyer, Guy Adams, told the court the battle stemmed from Dr Baker’s ‘unsubstantiated suspicions’ about the administration of her father’s estate in the early 1960s.

Speaking after the hearing, Dr Baker, who lives in a £350,000 house in Colchester, Essex, said: ‘My father did not have an affair with that woman. He was actually impotent as he had been struck down with tuberculosis. 

‘I will not have his reputation sullied.’

Dr Baker said her father, who amassed his wealth through timber and construction firms, remained faithful to her mother, Phyllis.

She claimed he regarded Norah as an employee and was planning on ‘asking her to go’.

Dr Baker, who is married, said he once poured slops into a shoe belonging to Norah, and asked: ‘Do you think I’d want to sleep with a woman like that?’

She claims that a second will that left her a quarter of his estate went missing.

'I will not have his reputation sullied': Dr Baker's father with her mother in the 1950s. Dr Baker believes her father was left impotent by tuberculosis and was thus incapable of having a mistress

Dr Baker denies claims in court that she had to be forcibly removed from the Palm Beach in 1997 after she and her sister ‘rampaged around the hotel, pointing out things they said belonged to them’.

Miss Line said last night: ‘She’s in denial that my mother and her father lived together. She is trying to take my house from me.’

Judge Kevin Prosser QC has reserved judgment and will give his ruling at a later date.
