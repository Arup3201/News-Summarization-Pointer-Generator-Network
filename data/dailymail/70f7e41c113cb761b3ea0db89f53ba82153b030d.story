Amid a firestorm of sexual abuse allegations, X-Men director Bryan Singer ducked in for a meal at West Hollywood’s upscale Nobu restaurant earlier this week.

The filmmaker was photographed Tuesday night emerging from the sushi restaurant with a group of male friends.

The 48-year-old award-winning director and producer was pictured on the occasion wearing a plaid shirt with a white jacket slung over his arm as he went to a silver Audi waiting outside.

Entourage: Singer's unidentified male friends first checked for paparazzi before walking out to a silver Audi waiting for them outside

The beleaguered filmmaker's unidentified companions first checked if the coast was clear of stalking paparazzi before heading out the door.

Singer's casual night out at the Hollywood hotspot frequented by celebrities came a day after a 25-year-old British man came forward accusing the openly gay X-Men creator of sexually abusing him when he was 17 years old.

The latest accuser filed a lawsuit Monday alleging that the Hollywood heavyweight performed lewd acts on him in a London hotel room in 2006 along with Broadway producer Gary Goddard.

Holding the pictures up to the media at a Los Angeles press conference, the unidentified man's attorney, Jeff Herman, said that his client was spurred to bring a lawsuit against the filmmaker after Singer was sued by another man on similar grounds.

Out and about: Singer's night out came a day after a 25-year-old British man accused the openly gay filmmaker of sexually abusing him when he was 17 years old

The lawsuit in federal court in Los 
Angeles said that Singer and 
Goddard, 59, coerced the British man into sex acts as a minor with the 
promise of helping him in an acting career.

This is 
the second lawsuit naming Singer ahead of the May 23 release of his film
 X-Men: Days of Future Past, which is expected to be one of the year's 
top grossing movies.

Singer's
 lawyer has called the allegations in both lawsuits false and 
fabrications, and a bid to win money from the director behind other 
films in the X-Men superhero franchise. A lawyer for Goddard also denied
 the allegations, calling them spurious.

Jeff Herman also represents Michael Egan, who last
 month sued Singer, Goddard and two other entertainment bigwigs over explosive
allegations that they abused him as part of an underage sex ring in 
Hollywood.

'He did this to 
support Mike, he realized he wasn't the only one this happened to,' 
Herman said at a news conference as he held aloft pictures of his client
 with Singer and Goddard from the 2006 premiere of Superman Returns in 
London.

According to The Daily Beast, Singer and Goddard allegedly engaged in inappropriate acts with a British teenager in the bedroom of a London suite around the time of the release of Superman Returns - which Singer directed - in 2006.

The suit has been filed by Egan's attorney on behalf on the plaintiff identified only as 'John Doe No. 117'.

It claims Goddard contacted the teen when he was 14 via social media, commenting John Doe was attractive and that he knew people who could help jump-start his acting career.

One of those people, Goddard said, was Singer.

Thereafter, Goddard told the boy he was in love with him, and 'convinced' the boy to send him nude photographs and a video masturbating. They then allegedly engaged in a webcam session which involved Goddard masturbating.

When John Doe was 16, Goddard invited him to London and plied with the boy with alcohol, before he  'engaged him in anal intercourse'.

When the teenager was 17, the suit alleges, Goddard told the teenager he and Singer were coming to London for a Superman movie premiere. 

At the after-party, the suit alleges that Singer offered the teenager a Quaalude, which the teenager rejected.

The lawsuit described how Singer then proceeded to fondle the young man, forced him to masturbate while sitting on his naked lap, and how the famous director of The Usual Suspects allegedly attempted to have anal sex with the teenager.

Besieged: Longtime friends Gary Goddard and Bryan Singer - seen here in New York in 2009 - have been accused of sexually assaulting two men when they minors

The suit contends that Singer violated the law by sexually assaulting the teenager, traveling to a foreign country for 'illicit conduct with a minor,' that he had arranged to 'meet with a minor to engage in lewd and lascivious behavior', and that by allegedly coercing the teenager in the way he did, Singer committed an act of 'gender violence' against him.

Marty Singer, the lawyer for Bryan Singer, told The Daily Beast the allegations contained in the latest lawsuit were 'totally untrue'.

Singer is already fighting the claims brought forward by Egan, who said he was given drugs and promises of a 
Hollywood career while being threatened and sexually abused in Los 
Angeles and Hawaii.

One
 of Egan's alleged attackers, internet businessman Marc Collins-Rector, was
 convicted of sex abuse charges in the years after the attacks, but it was the first time Singer was named.

Garth Ancier - who produced and/or developed shows like 21 Jump Street, Married ... with Children and The Simpsons - has adamantly denied laying a finger on the Michael Egan

His
 lawyer said the director was never interviewed by any authorities about
 the claims made by Egan, who has said that he reported the Los Angeles acts 
and doesn't know why charges were not pursued.

Days 
after filing the suit against Singer, Egan filed additional 
suits against former BBC Worldwide America president Garth Ancier, 
former Disney TV president David Neuman and theme park design firm head 
Gary Goddard.

Attorneys for Goddard called the charges 'without merit,' while David Neuman addressed the charges in a series of tweets, calling them 'completely false' and 'shocking'.

Egan
 appeared at a news conference last month alongside his mother and sex 
abuse attorney Jeff Herman at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.

'Hollywood
 adults are armed with something other adults aren’t armed with,' said 
Herman. 'It’s a tremendous amount of power...the power and influence to 
really make kids careers.'

Scandalous: Now that director Bryan Singer is embroiled in two teen sexual assault lawsuits, someone still has to go out and promote X-Men: Days of Future Past

MailOnline does not typically name 
victims of sex abuse but is naming Egan because he is speaking publicly 
about his allegations.

A judge in Hawaii set a July 21 scheduling hearing in Honolulu for the lawsuit, which was filed Wednesday
