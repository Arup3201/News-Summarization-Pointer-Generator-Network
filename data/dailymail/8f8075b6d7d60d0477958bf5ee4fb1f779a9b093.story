Touchscreens may have revolutionised mobile devices but when you want to access an app quickly - especially while wearing gloves or when it's raining - nothing beats a physical button.

This is the philosophy of Pressy, an add-on gadget created by New York developers Nimrod Back.

The small button plugs into a phone's headphone socket and can be customised to perform any action.

It comes with three preset actions - including switching on the torch, enabling Silent mode and taking a photo - but can also be customised using an app.

New York designers Nimrod Back have created the Pressy button, pictured, that can be customised to perform any action when fitted to a phone's headphone socket. The button links with the Pressy app and when pressed can be used to access the phone's flashlight, open the camera app, send a text and more

Any action that can be performed on a phone using the touchscreen can be assigned to the button using the Pressy app, pictured. Pressy can also register long and short-presses, as well as a series of clicks, meaning different sequences of presses can be used for different actions

To use the button, the device, pictured, is fitted inside the phone's headphone socket.

Actions are then customised in the Pressy app.

These actions can include calling a specific 
contact in the address book, sending a text message, checking into Facebook, and more.

Pressy can also register long and short-presses, as well as a series of 
clicks.

This means Pressy can be used to perform a number of different actions depending on the sequence of presses used.

The button device is fitted inside the phone's headphone socket and sticks out 0.7cm above the top of the handset.

The user then opens the Pressy app and decides which action they want the button to perform when it's pressed.

This can include calling a specific contact in the address book, sending a text message, opening the camera app, checking into Facebook, broadcasting the user's location in the case of an emergency, and more.

Any action that can be performed on a phone using the touchscreen can be assigned to the button and the button can also register long and short-presses, as well as a series of clicks.

This means Pressy can be used to perform a number of different actions depending on the sequence of presses used.

For example, three short clicks could be used to phone a particular friend, while a long press could turn on the phone's flashlight, or two short presses followed by a long press could open the camera.

Each sequence can be used to perform a different action and can be changed or removed as many times as the user wants.

Sequences can also be combined, for example, pressing the button in a certain pattern can open the camera, take a photo and upload it to a social network site.

The Pressy device fits in the headphone socket of any Android phone running Android 2.3 or above. The button sticks out 0.7mm above the handset, pictured. When not being used, Pressy sits in a specially designed keyring so the headphone socket can be used to listen to music

The designers have also made it possible for other developers to create ready-made actions within certain apps.

When a user wants to use the headphone socket to listen to music, the Pressy button fits into a keyring attached to the device, which means the headphones can be plugged in and the button can still be pressed.

The Pressy app is only opened each time the button is pressed, to conserve battery, and it only works on Android devices running version 2.3 or later.

Pressy is currently a Kickstarter campaign and the designers have already reached their target funding goal, meaning the devices will go on sale after the campaign closes on 1 October and are expected to be delivered by March next year.

It is expected to cost around $20 (£13), plus $5 (£3) shipping outside of the U.S.
