Blast from the past: Laura Hollowell, 25, is keeping alive the tradition of victory rolls - a hairstyle popular in the 1940s and 50s

It was a hairstyle made famous before Laura Hollowell was even born.

But inspired by her grandmother, the 25-year-old is keeping alive the tradition of creating victory rolls that were popular in the 1940s and 50s and worn by actresses Rita Heyworth and Katharine Hepburn.

Miss Hollowell uses the labour intensive art of pin curling to work painstakingly with inch-wide sections of hair winding each piece into precise curls before pinning them in rows around her head.

She then covers the whole lot with a head scarf and will then wait for up to eight hours before taking it all out and starting work sculpting it into a victory roll - which involves sweeping the top section of hair into a wave and leaving the rest loose.

It is a lot of effort to create the dated style, especially when hot tools like curling tongs could achieve similar in a matter of minutes.

But for Miss Hollowell the authenticity of the creation is all part of the thrill.

And she has even forged a business out of her passion, charging between £5 and £50 to style other women inside a garden shed she has turned into a studio.

‘If you’re doing the pin curl set it gets you feeling a part of that world even more,’ she said. ‘It’s all part of the experience. And also it gives a better result, you get a better set if you pin curl it rather than doing it with a tong. There’s lots of different ways to do it but I like it that way.’

She added: ‘The pin curling is like your foundation to creating different styles and then you can expand.’

As well as the pop up studio, which Miss Hollowell made with her parents, she also creates online video tutorials, teaching people how to recreate her style.

Inspiration: Miss Hollowell's grandmother Christine, Auntie Ellie and cousin Connie, pictured in Weymouth in 1958, first sparked her passion for the style

Dressed as her alter ego Madame Medusa 
in a neat grey skirt suit, black Mary Jane shoes and, of course, a 
victory roll, she guides viewers through the process, which she learnt 
from reading old fashioned books.

And sitting in her studio, surrounded by nostalgic relics and photographs of ‘Granny Jane’, 70, who inspired her to recreate the styles she saw in her favourite musicals from the past, Miss Hollowell said: ‘I think women back then, especially in in the 40s with the war, women had to ration their clothing so all they had to make themselves was to do their hair and make-up and it was a big thing for themselves to make themselves feel special.’

She added: ‘What I love is the innocence of it all, just waiting for your husband to come home, going dancing and spending the day in your pin curls waiting for him. That element of it just seems very romantic and that definitely appeals to me.’

So much so, it would seem, that Miss Hollowell has taken her unlikely hobby to BBC3 programme Hair (she will feature in Tuesday night’s episode), to compete among eight other stylists.

And she hopes to win the contest with her styles drawn from films of the past.

She said: ‘I look to the past to get inspiration, especially old movies and things. I remember watching them as a kid with my granny so definitely since then. We used to get dressed up and we would act out scenes from musicals. We always used to watch Calamity Jane with Dorris Day, over and over again. But I love Betty Grable, her movies, she’s got amazing hair.’

The end result: A model shows off her perfectly styled victory rolls

Step one: Apply setting lotion to wet hair to help curls form

Step two: Divide into one-inch sections, ready to make pin curls

Step three: Take the first piece of hair, wind into a loop and pin flat

Step four: Repeat for each piece, creating rows down head

Step five: Leave pin curls for at least six hours or overnight

Step six: Take out all pins and brush the hair with a bristle brush

Step seven: Select a triangle of hair on one side of the parting at the front of the head

Step eight: Backcomb the roots of this section to add volume

Step nine: Roll the section down towards the head and pin in place, leaving rest of the hair loose

Step ten: Finish with hair spray. Create a second roll if desired
