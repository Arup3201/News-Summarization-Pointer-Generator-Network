You think you've picked out the perfect dress for the office Christmas party, but a quick glance over your shoulder into the mirror reveals the dreaded truth: back fat.

Unsightly bulging bra lines and 'armpit cleavage' have been revealed as one of the most common complaints among women.

So in response to this, Sainsbury's have created a special skin-smoothing bra to banish lumps and bumps on your back for good - and it costs just £10.

Before and after: Sainsbury's Back Smoothing Bra's straps are closer 
to the centre to avoid unsightly armpit cleavage, and the bra is free of elastic to ensure it doesn't dig into the skin and cause 
rolls

The appropriately named Back Smoothing Bra is made from Powermesh fabric, the same body-shaping fabric used in control lingerie, and features a wide back panel to compress any bulges and create a smooth, streamlined 
back that emphasises the waistline and hides the effects of festive 
overindulgence.

The model spent a year in development, and one of its key features is that the fastening has been positioned at the front, between the cups, to avoid visible bra lines.

Available in black with a pretty silver clip front fastening and a feminine, flattering T-shirt bra cup, the bra is discreet, and aims to banish the image of control underwear as big, grey and worn by Bridget Jones.

Toni-Ann Lindsay, Sainsbury's Lingerie Buyer said: 'Our in-house design team has engineered this Back Smoothing Bra after "back fat" was highlighted as one of our customers' biggest body concerns.

'Both flattering and functional, we want our customers to know that Sainsbury's has got their back this Christmas and it's looking great.'

The new bra is available in 50 Sainsbury's stores nationwide from today, the Back Smoothing Bra is £10 and ranges from sizes 34-38 B-DD and 40C-DD.
