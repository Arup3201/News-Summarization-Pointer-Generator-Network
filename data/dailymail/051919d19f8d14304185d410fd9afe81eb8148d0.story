According to the teenager, several electronic appliances were missing from the house.

The 19-year-old was described by responding officers as being very distressed, 'dry heaving and kicking garbage cans in the driveway.'

But when questioned by investigators about inconsistencies in his version of events, Miller broke down and confessed to the slaying, according to his arrest affidavit cited by Orlando Sentinel.

The teenager, who listed his occupation on his Facebook page as 'singer-songwriter at American Idol,' told detectives that the idea to kill his grandfather came to him on Wednesday, but there is no word on a possible motive at this time.

The teenager was taken into custody and booked into the Orange County Jail Friday morning.

During a brief court appearance Saturday, Miller was ordered held without bond.
