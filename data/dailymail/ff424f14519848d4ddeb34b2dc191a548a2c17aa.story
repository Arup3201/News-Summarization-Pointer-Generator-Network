Three weeks ago, Jose Mourinho discussed Chelsea’s fixture against Arsenal and happened to mention, rather provocatively, that the midfielder the two sides had in common was now in love with the Blues.

On Saturday, it became increasingly evident that Chelsea’s fans are returning the affection.

Barely four months have passed since it was confirmed Cesc Fabregas would leave Barcelona for Stamford Bridge. In that short time the midfielder, almost as much as Diego Costa, has lifted this side from contenders to significant title favourites.

Cesc Fabregas has proved an instant hit at Chelsea since joining the club this summer from Barcelona

In two statistics, a partial measure of his impact can be taken: no Premier League player has completed more passes (671) or created more chances (25) than the Spaniard this season. 

Costa draws the bulk of the credit. Goals are the most valued commodity and nine in seven games mean he is, rightly, seen as the key cog in Mourinho’s machine. 

The absence of such an effective frontman last season makes his impact all the more obvious and profound. His absence in the coming fixtures with a hamstring complaint might highlight his importance further still.

But what of Fabregas? Chelsea’s squad was not crying out so loudly for a player in his mould during the summer. Yet if they win the title – granted, a strange suggestion considering it is October – it would be impossible, at this stage, to imagine the 27-year-old and his unique qualities not being at the heart of the success.

Against Crystal Palace on Saturday, he scored his first Premier League goal of the season. The magnificence of the goal came from its speed and the speed came from Fabregas’ vision.

He takes possession 35 yards from goal and rolls the ball into the feet of Eden Hazard. From there it’s a one-touch blitz as Hazard returns the pass and Fabregas feeds Oscar, who puts the midfielder through on goal. The finish is delightful and the goal rivals Jack Wilshere’s for Arsenal against Norwich last season.

Significantly, Fabregas never once looks down and was part of the move’s origin, back in his own half. Surges from deep are what he does.

It was telling that in the match, he ran 7.4 miles – 0.4miles further than the next most energetic player. Wenger, on the same day that Mourinho spoke of Fabregas’s love for all things blue, told journalists his former charge was not a defensive player. That he was still, at heart, an offensive creator whose home these days was foraging runs from deep, like Aaron Ramsey does at Arsenal.

It is in that position, in front of the back four but not defending, where Chelsea needed improving, albeit not as much as up front.

Last season, it was largely down to Nemanja Matic to be the deep-lying presence. In big games, the excellent Serb had David Luiz next to him. It is easy to see, therefore, why a tactical layer of Matic and Fabregas is so much better.

It is the platform from which Fabregas can have the most impact. On Saturday, he played 123 passes – more than anyone else. In context, Mile Jedinak hit the most for Palace with 50. All Chelsea moves seem to move through Fabregas, who in turn has become the side’s pacemaker of sorts, deciding when is the right time for urgency and when is the right time to wait.

At Barcelona - a spell that Wenger feels did not go as well as Fabregas would have hoped - he played in the middle of a midfield three and as a forward and sometimes on the side. When he arrived at Chelsea, it wasn’t obvious where he would play.

But by fielding him next to Matic, Mourinho has made the most of his energy, intelligence and ability to match clever runs with clever passes. He has seven assists for the season and Costa has often been handed the acclaim for finishing the moves.

John Terry indicated after the Palace win that surviving a Costa injury was the big question hanging over Chelsea’s credentials. That sounds about right. 

But one imagines Mourinho, and the club’s fans, are equally keen to keep Fabregas healthy.
