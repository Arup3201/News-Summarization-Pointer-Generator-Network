With her immaculate, glossy makeup, lustrous hair and daring style choices, Nicole Schzeringer has been the sartorial star of this season's X Factor, looking 'shamazing' week after week.

As well as her X Factor judging and mentoring duties, the singer has been working on a brand new campaign for Herbal Essences and we can bring you an exclusive first look, as well as a sneak peek inside her make-up bag.

Rocking a 60s beehive, the singer showcases her toned body, shiny hair and flawless skin in a monochrome outfit in the retro campaign.

But what's her secret to looking so good? The 35-year-old revealed her inspirations, as well as her tips and tricks when it comes to achieving that polish.

'I rocked a beehive for this shoot but I love to mix it up. When I'm doing hair, I'm always like: "I
 want  Brigitte Bardot or Sophia Loren hair. When I do updos I want 
Vivien Leigh's hair, I am inspired by the movie star look.'

Her range of hairstyles even got #ScherzingHair trending on Twitter, so what was Nicole's favourite look from the ITV series?

'Not the sha-bob,' she laughs.

'Not the forward ponytail that I tried out either! But really, I do like them all because at least I'm trying.

Behind the scenes: At Nicole's shoot, she said that she cites old school movie stars as her hair inspirations

'Louis was giving me hell for my hairstyles. He said "You look like Barbara Bush!" and I was like: "That's what I was going for, the first lady!

'You know what, I was born with this hair alright. I get to try new things in life. Just have fun with your hair, don't be safe.

'I love all the looks because they're daring. One week I've got Mohawks and braids and another week I have it just down.

'My favourite everyday look is the big bouncy 'lady curl' waves, as I like to call them.

'It isn't quite the beachy girl look, it is 
something special. It's as if you have had heated rollers in.

'You 
blow it out, and wrap a heated tong around your hair like a
 ribbon. You then pop it up to set and let it drop out,' she explained.

Hawaiian-born Nicole, who was ranked VH1's Sexiest Artist of All Time this year, opened up her beauty bag - and fans will be pleased to hear that she loves a good budget buy.

'I love Dr Murad toner and I really like the Bliss Triple Oxygen Instant Energising Eye Masks, they're really tingly and I use them every other day.

'I love the SK-II Facial Treatment Mask too, it is yummy!

'I love my creme blushes, illuminator, and moisturiser is everything to me because it keeps your skin fresh and dewy and not too cakey.'

Sharing her budget beauty tips, she said: 'My family makes it on coconut oil so I get that for free!

'It's so healthy for the skin, it's anti-bacterial, it is everything. You can use it for your hair and skin.

She's got the X Factor! Nicole, pictured with fellow judge Sharon Osbourne, says she is obsessed with glitter beauty products for the festive season

'Whatever lip gloss you have, use it on your cheeks too, I do that a lot. I also love the Boots eye make-up remover pads and No. 7 has good face wash.'

Speaking about her go-to festive look for this year's Christmas parties, Nicole advises: 'If you're going to wear your hair down, tease the roots and brush through the curls to make it really soft and full of volume.

'If you're going to wear your hair up, just rock a really dope textured top knot.

'When it comes to make-up, add a little bit of shimmer to your cheeks so you're glowing like a snowflake.

'I love lip glosses with tonnes of glitter, it's the holidays so you can't go wrong with glitter, right?.'

Nicole Scherzinger is the Herbal Essences Global Ambassador and the face of the relaunched Classic range of shampoo and conditioners - now back by popular demand!

Ben Cooke, Herbal Essences Ambassador and Celebrity Stylist said: 'Last night, Nicole took her favourite â€˜lady curlâ€™ one step further, she roughed up the texture to give a classic Nicole look with a harder, sexier edge.'

On doing her own hair, Nicole Scherzinger said: 'If youâ€™re going to wear your hair down tease the roots and brush through the curls to make it really soft and full of volume.My favourite everyday look would be big, bouncy, lady curls, as I like to call them!'1. Wash hair with Herbal Essences Moisture Balance shampoo and conditioner2. Apply a good amount of volumising mousse, I like Sebastian Mousse Forte3. Blast hair upside down to achieve maximum volume4. Using a large barrel tong randomly tong hair away from the face, leaving a few ends out for a more undone finish5. Finally, shake it out to give that sexy undone finish
