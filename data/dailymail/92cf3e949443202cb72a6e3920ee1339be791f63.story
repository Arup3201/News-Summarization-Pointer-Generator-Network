A U.S. aircraft carrier travelled through the Strait of Hormuz and into the Persian Gulf yesterday, ignoring threats from Iran to shut down the strategic shipping lane.

The USS Abraham Lincoln went through the strait without incident in what American government officials claimed was a routine changeover.

However, it was accompanied by British and French ships, a highly unusual joint exercise in the militarily sensitive region.

And a spokesman from the UK's Ministry of Defence said the flotilla was intended to 'underline the unwavering international commitment to maintaining rights of passage under international law'.

This appears to be a direct challenge to Iran, which has been increasingly belligerent over the strait in response to the threat of new economic sanctions targeting the Islamic Republic's nuclear programme.

When the carrier USS John Stennis departed the Gulf in late December, Iranian officials warned the U.S. not to return.

A top Iranian naval official boasted that closing the Strait of Hormuz, the world's most important oil shipping gateway, would be 'easier than drinking a glass of water'.

The threat led to a round of escalating rhetoric between the two sides that spooked oil markets and raised the possibility of a military showdown - the only way Iran would be able to control the strait.

But on Saturday a senior figure in the powerful Revolutionary Guards struck a more conciliatory tone, claiming that Iran did not mind the West resuming operation in the Gulf.

'U.S. warships and military forces have been in the Persian Gulf and the Middle East region for many years and their decision in relation to the dispatch of a new warship is not a new issue and it should be interpreted as part of their permanent presence,' he said.

A spokesman for the U.S. Fifth Fleet, which is based in Bahrain, said the Lincoln's passage through the strait was 'regular and routine' and that it had been 'previously scheduled'.

On his own: Iran's increasingly isolated president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went to Latin America to search for allies in his anti-American fight

Tensions between Iran and the U.S. have been escalating in recent weeks as Barack Obama prepares to implement new sanctions over the country's nuclear enrichment programme, which Tehran says is for energy production but which the West believes is aimed at producing atomic weapons.

Notable developments have included the trial of an Iranian-American man sentenced to death for spying for the U.S., and the assassination of another Iranian nuclear scientist, which the U.S. has condemned.

Iran's president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad went on a tour of Latin America looking for allies in left-wing leaders such as Venezuela's Hugo Chavez.

Last week saw both sides tone down their rhetoric, as Mr Obama was reported to have sent a letter to Mr Ahmadinejad offering more back-channel talks.
