An 11ft-long alligator that lived in a Mississippi park for eight years has been captured and killed after it moved to a nearby pond and lost its fear of humans.

The giant beast, which had been resident in Hiller Park in Biloxi, weighed about 600lbs and could have been up to half a century old.

But after it swan into the pond people began to feed it, making it a dangerous presence as it no longer feared man.

Officers from the state Department Of Wildlife, Fisheries And Parks were forced to kill the alligator.

Sgt Barry Delcambre, a state 
conservation officer, said: 'Think about it. You always have Canada 
geese there, and I've never seen a place like Hiller Park where you have
a nutria come out of the water in broad daylight and you almost have to
kick it out of the way.

'If you were an alligator, what better place would you want to be?'

The state's policy is, in most cases, to put down alligators that are longer than 7ft. Alligators fed by humans are always euthanised.

Feeding an alligator is illegal in Mississippi and can see offenders fined from $1,000 to $5,000 with a mandatory five days in jail.

Sgt Delcambre said: 'It upset me to kill that alligator. It had been out there near the park for eight years.

'The
city had put up signs that alligators might be present, and we'd 
arrested as many as five people for feeding alligators in the area.

'But the bottom line is that we live on the water. The water is their habitat.

'You should avoid alligators, and you should definitely never feed them.'
