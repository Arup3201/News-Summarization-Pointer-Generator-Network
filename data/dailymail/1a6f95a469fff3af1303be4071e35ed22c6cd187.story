Katie Couric has revealed that she is keeping her wedding plans on the low-key side, saying that her fiance is the one planning the event and it will be limited to family and close friends.

It will just be a small dinner in New York,' the talk show host revealed to The Hollywood Reporter at the Sundance Film Festival.

'Actually, he's the wedding planner!' she said of fiance John Molner.Â 

The wedding with be the second one for both parties, as Molner is divorced from his first wife, Jane, and Couric lost her first husband, Jay Monahan, to colon cancer in 1998.

Just a quiet night in New York: Katie Couric revealed that her fiance John Molner (seen together at the Met Ball) is planning their wedding which will be held at a restaurant in New York

New venture: Couric made the reveal while at the Sundance Film Festival where she has a documentary debuting, seen here on Sunday with her producing partners Stephanie Soechtig and Laurie David

The former Today Show host announced her engagement to her boyfriend of two years over Labor Day Weekend, and while she gleefully showed off the ring on morning shows in September, the formal planning process was put on hold as she had some major career developments over the past few months.

Her eponymous afternoon talk show was cancelled after two seasons and now she has been named as Yahoo!'s 'Global Anchor'.

The switch led to a pay cut, as her contract with ABC for her talk show was estimated to be around $20million per season and now she will earn $6million through the Yahoo partnership, but the work is expected to be part time.

She has also expressed her interest in 
working on more documentaries as she says the films 'are replacing 
journalism in some cases'.

Couric, 56, was in Utah for the premier of her first such documentary, Fed Up, which looks at the food industry's role in America's obesity problem.

She did not give any indication about when her wedding will take place, but when she first announced her engagement, she said that they would likely wait until her younger daughter Carrie leaves for college.

Carrie turned 18 on January 5, and will likely graduate this spring meaning that the aforementioned dinner could be happening in the coming months.

'I want to get her off into the world and enjoy her last year at home,' Couric previously said to People magazine.

Couric has two daughters from her first marriage to Jay Monahan who died due to colon cancer in 1998. She has had a few serious relationships over the past 15 years but this is her first engagement.
