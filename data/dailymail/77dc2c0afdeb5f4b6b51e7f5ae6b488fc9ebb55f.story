Shock: Claudia Dalgleish claims that Nick Griffin exposed himself to her in her car

BNP leader Nick Griffin is a sex pest who exposed himself to a former glamour model in her car, it was claimed today.

Claudia Dalgleish said that the far right leader bombarded her with text messages full of crude sexual 
innuendos during a campaign of harassment.

The 40-year-old said that Mr Griffin flashed at her after they ate a takeaway together in her vehicle.

Claudia - also known as Claudia Bryan - told the Daily Star Sunday that the married father-of-four pulled his trousers down after they finished the meal.

She got out of her Jeep to throw away the rubbish to find the leader had partially undressed himself.

'I came back and found Nick Griffin with his... trousers down by his knees. I was shocked and asked him what he was doing,' she said.

'I was disgusted. He was excited. I ordered him out of the car. He is a sex pest.'

Claudia and Mr Griffin were parked in a car park in Swanley, Kent, after she crossed the English Channel to fetch him from France when he was involved in a car crash.

Nick Griffin, who has a wife called Jackie, has portrayed himself as a family man in a bid to clean up his party's reputation.

Ms Dalgleish got to know the BNP leader as she was dating BNP member Steve Squire.

'Sex pest': Far right leader Nick Griffin who allegedly sent Claudia Dalgleish sexually explicit text messages

She claimed that the Mr Griffin, 52, also sent her a series of sexually explicit text messages.

Claudia, who now runs a model agency, wrote on her blog that the BNP leader sent her a message which said: 'Do you know the French side of the tunnel? And be aware that it’s very hot over here so you don’t need to wear very much.'

In another crude message, he allegedly said: 'That’s a given. As is checking that your legs feel as silky as they look.'

She said on the same day, he wrote in response to a straight-forward request: 'There goes the dominatrix side again. No need to insist, though on this occasion I will do as ordered. And only stop if told to.'

Ms Dalgleish claimed her boyfriend Steve Squire knew what was going on but urged her to spend time with Mr Griffin knowing it would advance his own career.

Nick Griffin is a Member of the European Parliament for the North-West region.

Despite MailOnline attempting to contact the British National Party, no one was available for comment today.

A separate call was made to Steve Squire but there was no response.
