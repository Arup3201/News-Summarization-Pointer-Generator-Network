This is the terrifying moment an articulated lorry ploughs into a group of pedestrians using a zebra crossing, sending them scattering like skittles across the road. But, mind-bogglingly, they all survived.

The group of six, shopping bags in hand, were attempting to cross the busy on M3 highway, a major trunk road that runs from Moscow to Russia's border with Ukraine, when the juggernaut failed to stop.

They notice the truck hurtling towards them and try to dive out of the way, but it is too late - they are sent flying in a cloud of dust and shopping.

Truck driver Dmitriy Mihalov, 39, travelling from Kaluga to Moscow, told police he had only been distracted for a second while changing a channel on the radio, and hadn't spotted the car in front of him that it stopped to let the pedestrians use the zebra crossing.
