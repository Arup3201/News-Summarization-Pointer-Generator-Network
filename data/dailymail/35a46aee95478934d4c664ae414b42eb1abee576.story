Australian captain Michael Clarke looks set to play in the first Test against India on Tuesday after training with the team in Adelaide on Saturday.

The 33-year-old joined his team-mates in practice for the first time since the funeral of Phillip Hughes on Wednesday in Macksville.

Clarke had been struggling with hamstring and back injuries and would've missed the first Test had it taken place as originally scheduled in Brisbane on Thursday.

The Australian team continued their preparations for the four-Test series against India on Saturday

But the delay has given the Australian captain a chance to prove his fitness ahead of the four-Test series.

Wicketkeeper Brad Haddin said that 'all signs' point to Clarke playing the first Test at the Adelaide Oval on Tuesday.

Haddin added: 'He (Clarke) is going in the right direction, and we're like everyone else, we want Michael out there.'

Clarke delivered an emotional speech in tribute to Hughes at his funeral on Wednesday, and Haddin said the team are looking forward to getting back on the field after the tragic events of the last fortnight.

'We need the support of the Australian public and everyone leading into this first Test,' Haddin said after practice at the Adelaide Oval.

'We're looking forward to playing and we need the help of everyone to enjoy the moment and just enjoy the game of cricket.

Adelaide  will host the first of four Tests between Australia and India before Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney

'Our job is to go and play cricket.'

The veteran wicketkeeper was reluctant to weigh into the sense of occasion the match at the Adelaide Oval will bring.

'I don't think you need to look too deep into what's going to happen. You're going to get a cricket game here on Tuesday, you'll enjoy it and so will we,' Haddin said.

'We get back to playing the game we love. I don't think you need to complicate it any more than that.'
