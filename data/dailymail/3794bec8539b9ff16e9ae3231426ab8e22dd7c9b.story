With an open plan kitchen and a cosy corner bed, it's all you could want from a poky city flat.

But this is a detached suburban home - and it's one of the smallest of its kind in the country.

At just 14ft wide, the former Victorian coach house looks more like a childhood crayon sketch than a couple's first-time buy. Estate agents, however, insist the £99,950 price tag makes it just that.

Bolthole: At just 14ft by 13ft, this former coach house in Sheffield could be Britain's smallest detached home

Cosy: The house is on sale for £99,950 - less than a fifth of the price of a garage sold in Chelsea, London

The property stands in the grounds of a larger Victorian house which was converted into 11 flats in the Sheffield suburb of Brincliffe.

Measuring 14ft 1in by 12ft 9in, it has 359 sq ft over two floors excluding a garage which comes with the price.

Into that space, the couple who live there currently have fitted an open-plan kitchen with a sofa and TV along with a bathroom, double bedroom and even a tiny landing.

The bedroom measures 9ft 9in by 8ft 4in, enough room to squish in a double bed and a small shoe rack, along with a built-in wardrobe.

The house's unusual design means it has had a wave of interest, say its estate agents - especially as detached houses in the same street have sold for up to £500,000.

Squeeze: The floor plan shows how the stairs rise over the electric hob, and there is even a small landing

Richard Atkinson from Haybrook estate agents claimed the house could be snapped up before Christmas.

'It's the smallest detached house I've ever seen,' he said.

'Despite only being on the market for about three weeks we've had lots of viewings - it's been a mixture of first time buyers and buy to let enquiries.

'The Coach House is such a unique place - it was incredibly hard to value.

'The living room takes up the entire ground floor which is exactly what people who after open plan living want.

'And you'll be hard pressed to find another detached house, with off-street covered parking, around here for under £100,000.'

The price is indeed cheaper than the average detached home in Sheffield, which sells for £280,000, or even the average terraced house at £127,000.

Bargain: The house is almost a third of the price of the average detached home in Sheffield, at £280,000

Downside: Sadly its external walls and use of electric storage heaters mean it will cost more to keep warm

Bonus: The house comes with this garage. Estate agent Richard Atkinson said: 'You'll be hard pressed to find another detached house, with off-street covered parking, around here for under £100,000'

But all those external walls mean the house is likely to cost far more to heat than the average home.

It comes only with electric storage heaters and not gas central heating. The kitchen hob, too, runs on electricity.

And the price will seem like a dream to anyone in London, where Britain's most expensive garage went on sale just weeks ago - for £550,000.

The ramshackle lock-up off the King's Road in Chelsea earned the enormous auction house price tag because it had planning permission to be demolished and turned into a small house.

Technically, there is a detached home which claims to be an inch smaller than the one in Sheffield - but it's a bit of a push.

Developer Peter Hunter built the 14ft wide property last year in what used to be a parking space between two end-of-terrace houses in Northenden, Manchester.

Unsurprisingly, his neighbours were not impressed - as the 70-year-old left a gap of just four inches on each side of his skinny home, blocking out a gable window.
