She became something of an internet sensation when a tour of her 'microstudio' hit the internet a few years back.

But for Felice Cohen, who lived in a 90-square-foot studio on Manhattan’s pricey Upper West Side, publicity wasn’t always a good thing – and she was handed an eviction notice when her landlord saw the video and realized her name was not on the lease.

Now, the professional organizer has managed to save up enough from living at her $700-month space to afford an apartment more than double the size, and recently gave a tour of the space.

Massive upgrade: Ms Cohen has now moved into a 500-square ft apartment just two blocks away

Snug: Felice Cohen, a professional organiser, lived in the 90-square ft apartment in New York for five years

‘There are so many people who are so 
angry with the small spaces. I think it doesn’t matter what size space 
you have. It’s about just finding, making any space your home,' she told
Faircompanies.com.

The artist and writer said that it was
never a sacrifice living in her 12ft by 7ft living space, adding that 
she managed to fit more belongings there than she does at her new 
500-square-foot residence.

Strangely, Ms Cohen got rid of many 
of her belongings in the move, saying that getting more space didn’t 
equate filling said space with more things.

‘If I don’t really love it, I don’t want it,’ she said.

The final frontier: Once Ms Cohen's knees were brushing the bathtub when using the restroom, but now, there's plenty of space

Ms Cohen moved to her new Upper West 
Side location after her landlord tried to double her $700-a-month rent, 
having found out that she wasn’t the person whose name appeared on the 
lease.

Facing eviction, Ms Cohen had no 
choice but to leave the Lilliputian flat behind. Luckily, she had saved a
significant amount of money from her rent, and could afford a place 
more than five and a half times the size of her former residence.

Her belongings fit in some 34 boxes. 
‘I really paired down,’ she told Faircompanies.com, showing off white 
cubbyholes full of neatly-folded clothes.

Inventive: With no kitchen in the tiny flat, Cohen bought a miniature fridge and stored fruit in the microwave

In 2010, Ms Cohen posted a video of how she worked with the pokey space, receiving millions of hits from impressed viewers.

The 'microstudio', which was lined with clearly-labelled storage boxes to the ceiling, had no kitchen.

Instead,
she relied on a miniature fridge and would use a toaster over and hot 
pot to cook meals. She also owned just two plates, one fork and one 
spoon, to save on space.

She climbed a ladder to get into bed,
where she slept with her face just inches from the ceiling. It was so 
cramped she suffered a panic attack on the first night she slept there.

Balance: Using the bathroom, which Cohen claimed was 'pretty big', proved to be tricky business

In her bathroom, which she claimed was 
'pretty big' for the size of the flat, she had to be careful not to bash
her knees on a cupboard as she sat sideways on the toilet.

By the bathroom door, Ms Cohen stored
her clothes behind a curtain, and would regularly fillet the wardrobe 
to make sure it did not grow beyond the boundaries of its small space.

The 'living room' was little more than a chair by the window with a reading lamp.

'I looked at the space like a challenge.
I knew I could make it work,' Ms Cohen, 42, told the New York Post. 'I 
never felt cramped. I also never thought I’d stay five years.'

Ms Cohen said it was help from her father -
a bankruptcy lawyer - and her grandfather - who survived the Holocaust -
that taught her to live frugally.

'How much stuff do we really need? It's less than you
think,' she said.

But she 
needed to look for a new place after her landlord saw the video she had 
made about the tiny space last summer and kicked her out - as she was 
illegally subletting.

'I didn’t even know it. Now my landlord said he will renovate the space and up the rent to $1,200,' said Cohen, who as a professional organizer has worked for celebrities including Naomi Campbell.

Ms Cohen told MailOnline she had been living with her uncle in
the Bronx, New York when she heard about her old apartment.

'A friend told me that if Michael Jordan stretched his
hands out he could touch both the walls,' she said.

She spent around $1,000 on shelving, the bed and other
storage units to make it as homely and manageable as possible.

Her new apartment is just two blocks away - and friends have joked about how she will cope.

'Everyone is teasing me - what I’m 
going to do with all that space,' she told the Post. 'I’m going to 
bounce off the walls, I guess.'

Prime location: Cohen loved the area of the flat, which was just one block from Central Park. She saved so much money on rent she can now afford a 500-square ft apartment in the same neighbourhood

Privilege: Felice paid just $700 a month - but now the landlord is raising this to $1,200 a month
