Michael Murphy received at least 10 calls from a Commonwealth Bank representative who was offering him money not to do an interview with A Current Affair

A Commonwealth Bank subsidiary has been accused of trying to prevent a victim of its financial advice scandal from speaking out by allegedly offering him money to keep quiet.

Michael Murphy had agreed to an interview with Channel Nine's A Current Affair two weeks ago to tell all about his ordeal, when the bank's subsidiary lost tens of thousands of dollars of his life savings by investing it in high-risk products.

But on Wednesday, the 79-year-old claimed he had been harassed by an employee of Financial Wisdom - a subsidiary of CommBank - in a bid to stop him from talking.

The latest accusation levelled at the bank and Financial Wisdom comes after both were involved in a financial advice scandal, which dated back to between 2003 and 2012, and involved some financial advisers transferring their clients' life savings into high-risk investments and giving poor advice.

In some cases, it has been alleged they were forging the signatures of clients to transfer to products that generated more profit. It is thought the dealings had lost millions of dollars for 12,000 customers.

Mr Murphy invested $125,000 with Financial Wisdom - but later found out that amount had dwindled to $9,000.

After the senior citizen had been interviewed by A Current Affair over his experience of the scandal, Mr Murphy suddenly got a call from a Financial Wisdom representative.

The program's reporter, Dan Nolan, heard recordings of about 10 phone conversations with the pensioner over the course of a few days.

Recordings of the calls were made without Mr Murphy's permission

The bank refused to hand over tapes of the exchanges to A Current Affair, but the program believed one of the calls which lasted for three minutes had two minutes missing.

Speaking about the calls he had with the Financial Wisdom representative, Mr Murphy said: 'It was just harassment and it went on all day, continually getting calls: "Have you called A Current Affair yet? Have you pulled out of A Current Affair yet?"'

Mr Murphy told ACA that in one conversation, that may not have been recorded, the representative asked him: 'How much would it take for you to withdraw from A Current Affair?'.

'They were offering me an inducement not to go ahead with the interview,' he said.

Mr Murphy said the woman offered him a financial incentive for his silence after he lost more than $100,000 in savings with Financial Wisdom

The subsidiary of CommBank recorded the calls without Mr Murphy's permission, but two minutes of one phone call has gone missing

Earlier this month on July 3, the bank's CEO Ian Narev apologised for CommBank's mishandling of fraud and misconduct allegations

Mr Murphy claimed he called the woman back and named his price.

He said she replied with 'Oh, well, I’m actually out of the office right now and I’ll get back to you tomorrow'.

'And I thought, well, she’s going along with me. She’s not saying, "We’re not in the business of offering money," she’s going along with me,' Mr Murphy said.

The next day the pressure on Mr Murphy to kill the ACA story ramped up.

In one of the calls, it was alleged by Mr Murphy that the representative said: 'I thought you emailed [ACA] not to go ahead with that interview until we’ve discussed further? If you tell them you don’t want to proceed with the program, they won’t proceed.'

Mr Murphy said he told her he needed a good reason not to go ahead and wanted an offer.

The representative allegedly replied: 'Things don’t move that quickly. We will reopen your file and look at it again and I will be back in touch with you today. If you don’t want to proceed with that interview, you are perfectly within your rights to tell them.'

But a Commonwealth Bank spokesperson said allegations it tried to offer money to a customer was 'purely fanciful'

But Commonwealth Bank has denied its staff had tried to offer anyone money in exchange for silence.

'We strongly deny ACA's allegation that the Commonwealth Bank offered an incentive not to appear on the show. This is purely fanciful,' a bank spokesperson said in a statement to ACA.

'Our priority is to ensure Mr Murphy's case is fully investigated and resolved. We are continuing to work with Mr Murphy to ensure he is happy with the management of his case and that we reach a fair and appropriate outcome under the Open Advice Review program,' they said.

'In this instance, Mr Murphy's case manager, with whom he has been working with for some months, was out of the office on annual leave, so to ensure accurate notes were taken to assist in resolving Mr Murphy's complaints, recorded some of the calls.

'Although this was done with the right intention, it is not standard practice and the case manager should have asked for Mr Murphy's permission to record the call.

'We have apologised to Mr Murphy and have explained the unusual circumstances.'
