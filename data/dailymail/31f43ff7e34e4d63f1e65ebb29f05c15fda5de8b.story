Benjamin Netanyahu has received support in the form of action movie star Chuck Norris, who claims the Israeli leader's re-election is crucial for the safety of the country.

In a short YouTube video called Please Vote For Prime Minister Netanyahu, Norris, 75, said: 'I watched Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech before Congress, and I saw a man who loves his country with all his heart and soul. I also saw a strong leader that is absolutely crucial for the safety of the Israeli people.

'I have done three movies in Israel – 'Delta Force' being my favorite – and I formed many friendships while there. You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way.

'You have an incredible country, and we want to keep it that way': Chuck Norris, 75, has made an intervention into the Israeli election, calling on Benjamin Netanyahu to be re-elected

'Courage and vision': Norris believes that Netanyahu is the leader who can stand up against the 'evil forces' threatening both Israel and the United States

'That's why it is so important that you keep a leader who has the courage and vision to stand up against the evil forces that are threatening not only Israel but also the United States. 

'You see, we, the American people, need Prime Minister Netanyahu as much as you do. Weak leadership can destroy your country and then the evil forces can concentrate on America, too.

'So I ask you, please, for the sake of Israel and the whole Middle East, vote for Prime Minister Netanyahu on Election Day.

'And as far as those in the U.S. and the rest of the world, in this season of Easter, it's good to remember what the Hebrew Scriptures say about Israel and those who support her: "Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: May they prosper who love you" (Psalm 122:1).'

Norris, star of Way of the Dragon, Walker, Texas Ranger; and the subject of countless internet memes and jokes, backed Mr Netanyahu during the last Israeli election.

He is also not the only Hollywood star to lend his support to Mr Netanyahu.

Jon Voight, the Oscar winner and father of Angelina Jolie, released a video last week voicing his support as well as his disdain for Barack Obama, saying 'President Obama does not love Israel'. 

He follows this up by saying: 'His whole agenda is to control Israel. In this way, he can be friends with all of Israel’s enemies.'

He further says in the Just Jared video: 'He [Obama] doesn’t want Bibi Netanyahu to win this upcoming election. America has not been the same since his presidency. I beg all of you to understand the truth.'

Mr Netanyahu meanwhile reiterated an appeal to hard-liners, posting on his Facebook page that high Arab voter turnout was endangering his right-wing party's dominance.

'Arab voters are going to the polls in droves. Left wing organizations are bringing them in buses,' he said.

He also called on supporters to vote for him to 'narrow the gap' between Likud and the Zionist Union.

'With your help, and with the help of God, we will build a nationalist government that will protect the state of Israel,' he said.

A new joint list of Arab parties, unifying four factions, has energized Arab voters and is poised to make big gains in the race. Israel's Arabs make up 20 per cent of the population.

Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday there would be no Palestinian state if he were reelected. He's pictured here giving a statement during his visit on Monday to Har Homa, an Israeli settlement in annexed east Jerusalem

Mr Netanyahu, who is seeking a third consecutive term, has vowed he would never allow the Palestinians to establish a capital in the city's eastern sector and pledged to build 'thousands' of settler homes.

He told public radio the two-state solution was now irrelevant, saying the 'reality has changed' and 'any territory which would be handed over would be taken over by radical Islamists'.

The Palestinians want east Jerusalem as capital of their future state, and continued settlement building has incensed the international community, which sees it as an obstacle to peace.

Throughout his campaign, Mr Netanyahu has repeatedly accused Zionist Union leaders Isaac Herzog and former peace negotiator Tzipi Livni of being ready to abandon Israel's claim to Jerusalem as its indivisible capital.

Mr Netanyahu's most strident statement came when he was asked by the rightwing NRG website if it was true that there would be no Palestinian state established if he was re-elected.

'Indeed,' said Mr Netanyahu, who in 2009 had endorsed the idea of two states living side by side.

Mr Netanyahu has based his campaign solidly on security issues, notably the Iranian nuclear threat, giving short shrift to the focus on economic issues in centre-left campaigning.

'If Tzipi and Bougie set up the next government, Hamastan 2 will be established on these hills here,' he said in Har Homa, using the nickname of his key challenger, Labour leader Mr Herzog.

'Hamastan' is a derogatory term used by Israeli politicians to refer to the Gaza Strip, which has been ruled by Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas since 2007.

Mr Herzog, meanwhile, has dismissed Mr Netanyahu's jibes.

On Sunday he pledged to 'safeguard' Jerusalem 'in actions, not just words, more than any other leader', and on Monday insisted Jerusalem would remain forever Israel's 'undivided capital'.

Former prime minister and Labour leader Ehud Barak came out in support of Mr Herzog, calling him 'experienced and responsible' and someone who could be relied upon to ensure Israel's safety.

Despite Mr Netanyahu's rhetoric, the Zionist Union is tipped to come out on top in the election.

Final opinion polls published late last week put the Zionist Union ahead with 25-26 seats with Netanyahu's Likud taking 20-22 in the 120-seat Knesset.

The leader of the party which secures most votes does not necessarily become the next premier - as in 2009 when the centrist Kadima party then headed by Livni effectively won the vote but lost the election in a race which brought Netanyahu to power for a second term.

'In 2009, (Likud) had a 100-percent chance of forming a government while the leader of the largest party, Tzipi Livni, had no chance whatsoever - and therefore she was not nominated,' Diskin said.

Under Israel's complex electoral system, the task of forming a government does not automatically fall to the party with the largest number of votes, but to the MP or party leader with the best chance of cobbling together a coalition with a parliamentary majority of 61.
