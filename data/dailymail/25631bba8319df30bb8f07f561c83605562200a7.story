'Considerate': Father-of-one Ashley Barrell, pictured outside court today, was praised for not hitting pedestrians and driving at 20mph in the stolen vehicle

A drunk teenager stole a bus from its depot so he could get home after spending the last of his money on a portion of chips.

Ashley Barrell had spent the night drinking in Colchester, Essex, before sneaking into the depot in Magdalen Street in the town centre, where he helped himself to a single-decker bus in the early hours of the morning.

The 19-year-old got behind the wheel and started up the engine - using its button-press ignition.

He bumped into two parked buses as he pulled away before smashing through locked metal gates and out onto the road.

A First Bus security guard reported the theft and Barrell was followed by a police officer as he drove towards his Colchester home.

The 20mph chase was brought to a halt two miles later by officers using a 'stinger' device to puncture the tyres.

Barrell, a father-of-one, was arrested on the bus and charged with aggravated vehicle taking and driving whilst drunk following the slow-paced pursuit on 24 August.

He pleaded guilty to both charges when he appeared before Colchester Magistrates’ Court today and was sentenced to four months in a young offenders institution.

Barrell, who works as a roofer, was sentenced to four months for the aggravated vehicle taking and three months for drink-driving, with the sentences to run concurrently.

He was also banned from driving for 18 months.

The court heard how police officers had remarked on the considerate nature of Barrell’s driving.

Ita Farrelly, mitigating, revealed that he had only driven the bus home because he 'spent the last of his money on chips' after his night drinking.

She said: 'He was walking home with his chips in hand. He passed the depot and had heard a rumour that the buses were not locked.

'He got in and pressed the button to start up the bus. It is not a usual vehicle, it does not require a key, and the bus started and he drove the bus.

'He thought he could go to his home, get out of the bus and leave it there but, of course, it is going to attract attention and get a lot of comments at the depot when they realised that the bus was missing.'

Miss Farrelly praised Barrell for the nature of his driving, saying once out of the depot he did not hit any pedestrians or vehicles and only went onto pavements so he would not smash into pedestrian traffic islands.

She added: 'It was an incident which was stupid in nature. Simply to get a bus rise home and put himself at risk and members of the pubic at risk. It was a vary grave mistake.'

Wayne Ablett, prosecuting said: 'At 3.50am Mr Barrell was seen starting up one of the buses within the private property and was driving out of the front of the yard causing damage to two other buses in the process.

'He then drove towards the secure metal gates and through them and out onto the road.'

Mr Ablett told the court Barrell’s actions caused about £2,000 of damage to the buses involved. Barrell was breathalysed and gave a reading of nearly twice the legal limit.

Barrell faced four charges; aggravated vehicle taking, driving whilst drunk and driving without insurance and driving without a licence.

The counts of driving without insurance and driving without a licence were dropped at court today.

The court heard that Barrell's driving of the single-decker bus caused about £2,000 of damage to the vehicles involved. Above, a file image of a single-decker First Bus
