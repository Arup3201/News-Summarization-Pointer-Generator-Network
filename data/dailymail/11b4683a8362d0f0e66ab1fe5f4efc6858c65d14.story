A school nurse accused of chasing a pupil down a corridor and pushing her against a door after enduring a torrent of abuse from the 'volatile' schoolgirl could be struck off.

Theodora Armah is alleged to have lost her temper and pursued the girl - described as 'one of the nastiest kids in school' - after being sworn at by the Year 8 student at an east London girls' school, a misconduct hearing was told.

Armah, described as a 'calm and collected person' by colleagues, denies chasing the girl through the corridors at break time at Haggerston School in Hackney, and pushing her against a door outside the headteacher's office.

Fellow nurse Doreen Patterson said she saw Armah chasing a group of girls before returning to the classroom.

‘I saw a group of girls running towards us and Ms Armah in pursuit of the girls running behind them,' she told the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

'We asked what had happened and she just smiled and carried on running. ‘Ms Armah came back and said a pupil had called her a f****** b****. ‘She said she had chased after the student to find out why she was being rude.

‘She caught up with the student and was able to ask this.’

The hearing was told how nurses were regularly abused by students when they visited the girls secondary school.

One nurse was called a ‘f****** p****’ by a different pupil, but the health professionals who visited the school to offer vaccinations and carry out other medical checks were afraid to report the abuse, the council was told.

‘The girls were very aggressive and rude on this day’, Ms Patterson said. ‘When I asked some of the girls to wait outside, one came up to me and shouted at me.

‘I felt very threatened because there was no one to support me,' she added.

She told the hearing her boss did not want to help ‘because most of the children are in gangs’. 

'Challenging': Armah is accused of lashing out at a Year 8 pupil during a health visit at Haggerston School in East London

Ms Patterson added that Armah had been verbally abused by a student the day before she is accused of lashing out.

Armah allegedly harangued the unnamed pupil before violently attacking her, a claim she vehemently denies. The hearing was told the girl, referred as child A, had a history of abusive outbursts and was on a child protection register. Grace Rooney, from Hackney's school nursing service, who investigated the alleged attack on child A, described her as one of ‘the nastiest kids in the school’, and noted: ‘She can even attack you physically within a second.’ Defending Armah, David Welch said child A had climbed out of school windows in the past, and once danced on a teacher’s desk. ‘She was an extremely volatile child’, he said, to which Ms Rooney answered: ‘There are children who have challenging behaviour.’ ‘This is not challenging is it’, Mr Welch said. ‘It’s downright dangerous.’

The alleged assault by Armah happened on December 10, 2009, during a regular visit to the school on behalf of City and Hackney Community Health Services. Ms Rooney said headteacher Dr Jane Keeley overheard the argument between Armah and the girl and came out moments after the alleged attack. ‘It was the break for all students and Dr Keeley heard raised voices in the corridor’, Ms Rooney said. ‘That’s why she came out of her office. ‘It was break but I do believe it wasn’t just the noise of children having a break.’ The incident was not reported to the police or social services, which Ms Rooney accepted was a ‘major oversight’.

It took almost two months for the school to get a full account from child A of what happened. Mr Welch suggested the reasons she was reluctant to co-operate with the investigation was because she had invented the allegations. Ms Patterson said Armah is a ‘calm and collected person’, and doubted she would have lost her temper in this way. ‘She is not the type of person to be accused of something like this’, she said. ‘The school should take some of the blame for letting the students abuse us,' she added.Armah denies running after Child A, shouting at her and pushing her against the wall.

If the panel finds her fitness to practice is impaired by reason of misconduct she could be struck off.

The hearing continues.
