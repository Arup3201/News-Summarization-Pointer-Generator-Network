President Barack Obama used the State of the Union address as the time to announce that 34,000 of the 66,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan will be home in America within one year.

'Tonight, I can announce that over the next year, another 34,000 American troops will come home from Afghanistan. This drawdown will continue. And by the end of next year, our war in Afghanistan will be over,' he said boldly during his speech.

An aide close to the president released the information anonymously a few hours before the speech, but he confirmed it in front of a crowd of cheering politicians later in the evening.

Eying the next step: President Obama announced on Tuesday that 34,000 troops will return home from Afghanistan over the course of the next year as the military winds down it's presence in the country

Addressing the crowd: Though it was leaked earlier in the day, the news was formally announced during the State of the Union address in the House Chamber

The U.S. is still finalizing plans for 
the size and scope of its military presence after the war ends. The 
White House has said it would be open to leaving no troops in 
Afghanistan, though it's likely that a small presence will remain, in 
keeping with the Pentagon's preferences.

The skilful plan allows the military commanders in Afghanistan the flexibility they require in controling the speed of the troop reductions.

Aware that the majority of fighting intensifies against the Taliban from now until October, the military were keen to retain a significant force to allow them to mange their withdrawal.

Speaking to the New York Times, White House officials would not be pressed into revealing the exact timetable for the troop reductions - but said that numbers will fall to around 60,000 in spring.

That number would remain through the fighting season and then would encounter the drop to 32,000 by this exact time next year.

A Washington Post poll out Tuesday morning shows that 80 per cent of registered 
voters support the president's policy to end the war in Afghanistan.

Obama discussed the next phases of the troop reduction with Afghan President Hamid Karzai during a day-long meeting in Washington last month, the first meeting between the two leaders since Obama's re-election.

The two leaders agreed to accelerate their timetable for putting Afghan forces in the lead combat role nationwide, moving that transition up from the summer to the spring.

The White House has a range of options to reduce troop levels in Afghanistan and has been considering whether to leave no troops in country following the end of operations in 2014.

The plans were drawn up by General John Allen, who was until recently the U.S. commander in the war-torn country and whose final days were smeared by his links to the scandal which caused the resignation of David Petraeus as CIA Director.

Allen was cleared of any allegations of inappropriate behavior in the scandal and was replaced in Afghanistan by Marine General Joseph Dunford.

Dunford's mission is to oversee the last two years of U.S. military operations in the country and the withdrawal of the troops.

'Today is not about change, it's about continuity,' said Dunford at a change-of-command ceremony in Kabul,

Progress: Once the 34,000 troops are removed, the American force in the country will be cut in half

'I'll endeavor to continue the momentum of the campaign and support the people of Afghanistan as they seize the opportunity for a brighter future.'

Speaking earlier this year in January, President Obama confirmed that most U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan would end in spring.

'Our troops will continue to fight alongside Afghans when needed, but let me say it as plainly as I can: Starting this spring, our troops will have a different mission - training, advising, assisting Afghan forces,' said Mr. Obama on January 11th in an East Room news conference.

Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said today in a farewell speech at the Pentagon that he thought the U.S. was pursuing the right strategy.

'We are on the right track in Afghanistan,' he said.

Some private security analysts, as well as some Pentagon officials, worry that pulling out of Afghanistan too quickly will leave the battle-scarred country vulnerable to collapse.

In a worst-case scenario, that could allow the Taliban to regain power and revert to the role they played in the years before 9/11 as protectors of al-Qaeda terrorists bent on striking the U.S.

Many Americans, however, are weary of the war, according to public opinion polls, and are skeptical of any claim that Afghanistan is worth more U.S. blood.
