A pair of smirking drug dealers posed for a picture outside court minutes before they were jailed and posted it on Facebook.

Aaron Manton, 19, joked 'see you all in three years' before publishing the image of himself with Rachel Priest, 19, outside Northampton Crown Court from a Blackberry phone.

The pair were awaiting sentencing for supplying morphine to their friend Elliot Edwards, 17, who died of an overdose.

The photograph, taken outside the doors to the court building, show the pair dressed in smart suits as they smile happily for the camera.

When asked what was happening by a friend on Facebook, Manton wrote back: 'I'm going jail in a sec.'

In a series of light-hearted comments on the picture Manton continued to joke with friends.

The court heard Mr Edwards died in Priest's flat in Northampton after drinking 'prodigious' amounts of alcohol and snorting crushed morphine pills.

The trio had been drinking in Northampton town centre until 4.30am before taking drugs and returning to the flat at 7.30am.

When they woke up at 3pm Mr Edwards was still sleeping in a chair. An hour later they realised he had stopped breathing and phoned for an ambulance.

However, he was later pronounced dead at Northampton General Hospital.

When police searched the flat they found a total of 200 morphine tablets, which had been purchased by Manton and stored by Priest.

Manton, from Peterborough, admitted supplying a Class A drug and possession of a Class A drug with intent to supply and was jailed for four years and four months.

Priest, from Northampton, was jailed for 14 months for permitting the supply of class A drugs at her home.

Sentencing the pair Judge Rupert Mayo said: 'I make it plain that in assessing this offence the court is in no way attempting to place value on the life of Elliot Edwards.

'No sentence will bring him back.

'The demon was laid when you, Manton, obtained the large quantity of pharmaceutical drugs, which you knew were not prescribed to you and you left at Rachel Priest's home.

'Both of you should rightly feel a degree of responsibility for the death of your friend.'
