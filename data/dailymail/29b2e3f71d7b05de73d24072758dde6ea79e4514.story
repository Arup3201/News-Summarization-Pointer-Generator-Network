Romance of the FA Cup? Not for Liverpool. While there have been countless tales in this season’s competition to put sheen on the old pot, Liverpool have been reacquainted with old ghosts.

First up was Wimbledon, meaning a month of having to listen to countless references to that final of 1988, when ‘The Culture Club’ of John Barnes, Peter Beardsley and John Aldridge came undone against ‘The Crazy Gang’, destroying their chances of a Double

The fifth round draw put on the agenda a potential reunion with Alan Pardew of Crystal Palace; Pardew, remember, was the man who settled the 1990 semi-final at Villa Park, his goal securing a 4-3 win that derailed Liverpool’s hopes of landing the two big domestic gongs.

Sandwiched in between, of course, was Bolton. Back in 1993, they inflicted one of the biggest surprises in the competition’s history, winning 2-0 at Anfield as a club from the old third division to ensure Liverpool’s FA Cup defence got no further than the first hurdle.

To many of the players Brendan Rodgers selected here, history should have had no bearing but Liverpool have laboured through this year’s FA Cup as if the psychological scars have not healed. Perhaps we should have known all along that one of the old spectres would haunt them.

The thing is, they should have got through this test. Bolton – and they deserve tremendous credit – were organised, spirited and tenacious but should they really have been able to keep a side that cost more than £110million to assemble so quiet for two games?

Rodgers was not in the least bit perturbed about this tie being taken to a replay, as he was adamant the slick, open playing surface at The Macron Stadium would suit Liverpool, allow them to pass, pass and pass until Bolton were hypnotised.

Anfield’s pitch has been a source of contention for Rodgers, who believes the surface is hindering Liverpool’s potential, so he knew there were no excuses. This had to be a night for some of those ball players to come to the fore.

For long period, however, it seemed as if his players wanted to score the perfect goal. Bolton were spirited in the first 45 minutes but Liverpool over-elaborated, as if they were trying to walk the ball into the net.

Steven Gerrard, Philippe Coutinho, Raheem Sterling – all were guilty of lacking the gumption to finish off the moves that took them into positions to pull the trigger. Coutinho and Sterling – the two great hopes for the future – were particularly guilty.

Coutinho was big news in the build up to this game, the new contract he signed ensures he will stay at the club until 2020 and Rodgers felt compelled to liken him to Luka Modric and Toni Kroos, the men responsible for keeping Real Madrid carousel ticking.

The midfielder though had an average performance against their Championship opponents on Wednesday

Labelled ‘the magician’ by Rodgers, there is no doubt he has wonderful ability but sometimes Coutinho leaves you exasperated that he doesn’t light up the big games away from home and this was a contest that was heading that way.

Until injury time. The goal he scored to ensure more ‘memories’ will be dredged up in the coming weeks was magnificent, full of lift, spin and vision that only a few would attempt and fewer still would be able to pull off.

He came good just when Rodgers needed him. He needs to keep doing it.
