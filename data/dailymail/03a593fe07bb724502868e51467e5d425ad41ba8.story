A photograph shows the incredible moment a friendly dolphin  leaps out of the sea right in front of a pair of stunned boatmen.

The majestic mammal named Fungi is well-known in Ireland, having spent the past 30 years entertaining sea-goers who spot him playing in the water.

He has become a bit of a celebrity since first appearing in Dingle Harbour in 1983 and his sociable antics are thought to have helped people suffering from depression.

This photograph shows the incredible moment a friendly bottle-nose dolphin named Fungi leaps out of the sea right in front of a pair of stunned boatmen who were taking a trip out to sea off the coast of County Kerry

But not many people have come as close to the 40-year-old lone bottle-nose dolphin as seaweed farmers David Millard and Mike Murphy.

As they travelled through the sea on their way home from work, off the coast of County Kerry, Fungi leapt from the water to within two-foot of their boat. 

Mike, who runs Dingle Harbour Seaweed, managed to capture the amazing moment on the camera of his mobile phone.

David said: 'The two of us were coming back in having been working out at the seaweed farm.

'Paul Flannery, a joint partner in Dingle Bay Seaweed who also runs Dingle Bay Charters, has often told us of Fungi's exploits and we were hoping he'd come and play.

'As he blasted out of the water, we got such a shock as he was so fast, so high and so close to us. The boat is only about 16 foot long and he'd be nearly the same length.'

David, who works for the Irish Sea Fisheries Board, added: 'Mike is always on his phone so he started snapping away and as Fungi repeated his jump for the third time he got him.

'We were delighted and laughing all the way home. It was definitely a good day at the office.'

The incredible picture has now gone viral after David's brother Stephen uploaded to Twitter.
