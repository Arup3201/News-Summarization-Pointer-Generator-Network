Christmas, they say, is a time for reflection. At 3.01pm, Steve Bruce wore the horrified look of a beaten man left to wonder where it had all gone wrong, and if it would ever go right again.

Curtis Davies, his captain no less, had just gift-wrapped Sunderland’s opening goal inside 30 seconds and his side were staring at an 11th league match without victory.

Then, though, came a hearty helping of festive fortune; two home penalties denied and an equalising goal – against the run of play – which only looped into the back of the net thanks to a Stadium of Light divot after Gaston Ramirez had taken aim from 25 yards.

James Chester headed the visitors in front after half-time and Nikica Jelavic made certain of their first away win since the opening day of the season in stoppage-time.

Bruce’s luck was in and his side were out of the bottom three.

And, after his fourth straight victory over the club who sacked him three years ago, the Geordie reflected: ‘We needed a victory. I take no real pleasure in that it’s four straight wins here. But the vast majority might just have a little look and think “he didn’t do a bad job here after all”. 

'People say I'm a black and white (Newcastle fan), well today I'm pleased to be.'

It had been a nightmare start when Davies' blunder allowed Johnson to score. ‘Sometimes there is no hiding place,’ said Bruce. ‘It was awful, a horrible mistake. After that it would have been easy to capitulate. It took us about 20 minutes to settle but after that the best team won at a canter.’

Gus Poyet, meanwhile, had urged his team to build on the euphoria of last weekend’s win at Newcastle and, when Tyne-Wear derby hero Johnson punished Davies’ error to put them in front, he must have thought victory was theirs.

Complacency, though, was to prove their undoing, as was the failure of Andre Marriner to award a penalty when both Alex Bruce and Stephen Quinn handled inside the area.

Poyet fumed: ‘It was one of the worst afternoons in terms of decisions.

‘You don’t need to ask if they were penalties. I’ve got a great life and I’m not going to give the FA a penny.

‘But we had the perfect start and didn’t take advantage of that. 

‘Until the penalty incidents it was a normal game. After the penalty incidents the game changed completely.

Hull went into the match without a win in 10 games and were behind after a minute following a defensive lapse

‘The atmosphere inside the stadium and the emotion of the players changed, it was strange. We spent too much energy thinking why they were not given.

‘But I was disappointed with the second-half performance.’

Of the penalty appeals, Bruce said: ‘For me, the referee has got them right. Quinn had his hand protecting his face. When it’s that close how are you supposed to get out the way? The referee showed common sense.’

Davies, though, had threatened to ruin Bruce’s return to Wearside.

It was a day too late for the Own Goals and Gaffs stocking filler, but the skipper made a late entry for defensive howler of the year.

Having rolled his backpass hopelessly short, he had a chance to spare further embarrassment by swiping the ball to the stands. Instead, however, he attempted to shepherd possession back to Allan McGregor and was very quickly robbed by Johnson.

He duly rounded McGregor – whose indecision was in part culpable to the farcical concession – and slotted into the empty net. Bruce’s face told its own sorry story.

Sunderland should have doubled their lead with the visitors shaken but the closest they came was when Seb Larsson fired on goal from Johnson’s pullback only for Liam Rosenior to slide and deflect wide.

Then came the equaliser. Ramirez drifted infield and dispatched low towards the bottom corner. Costel Pantilimon had it covered, or so he thought, and the big Romanian was helpless as the ball skipped up off a divot and into the net.

Bruce needed luck on his side twice more before the break as well. Johnson strode into the area from the right and when his dribble was cut short by the hand of Bruce, the 44,817 inside the stadium expected Marriner to point to the spot. He didn’t.

Two minutes later and the whistler was refusing the hosts another penalty when Quinn’s palm blocked Jordi Gomez’s cross, albeit from point-blank range.

Bruce junior then bailed out his dad with a goal-line clearance from Larsson’s header and McGregor shovelled Santiago Vergini’s near-post blast around the upright.

Half-time was a welcome arrival for the Tigers chief but whatever he said during the interval served as inspiration for his side and they were ahead on 52 minutes.

Ramirez swung over his corner from the right and Chester escaped Sebastian Coates to flash home his first since the opening day of the season.

The hosts offered nothing in response and substitute Jelavic made sure of the points as he broke clear before tucking beneath Pantilimon in stoppage-time.

Bruce, at last, was reflecting on victory.
