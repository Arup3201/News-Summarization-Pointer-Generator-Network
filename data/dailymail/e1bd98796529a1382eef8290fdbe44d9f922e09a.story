A man who spent £30,000 on dozens of failed hair transplant operations was left so self-conscious he refused to let his girlfriend touch his hair for a full six months after they got together.

Despite dating Natalie, 35, regularly, Spencer Stevenson, 37, from Newark, Nottinghamshire, managed to keep his botched attempts at hair transplants a secret.

Spencer, who started losing his hair at just 21 avoided telling his future wife that he was spending thousands of pounds on hair transplants - all of which failed to work -  until they were about to move in together.

Natalie put her partner's hatred of 
having his hair touched down to vanity. 'I didn't want to tell her because I was embarrassed. I was self-conscious and lacked confidence. It was my Achilles heel,' he says.

Spencer, who began to go bald at the age of 21, says the decision to have a hair transplant was a last resort.

'When I started to lose my hair, I attempted to salvage it over the course of several months,' said Spencer.

'I tried everything - wigs, treatments, all lotions and potions, but the hair loss continued. It affected me hugely emotionally.'

As a result, Spencer began suffering from mild depression. He felt isolated, 
didn't want to go out and constantly wore a hat. He says it was on his mind 'every minute of every day'.

Finally Spencer made the decision to try a hair transplant.

While he was 
travelling through America a glamorous-looking advert for hair restoration 
caught his eye and he thought, 'this could be the answer'.

He went for it, full of hope, but the results were less than ideal. Not much hair grew back and the hair that did, did not look natural. He now says he felt he had been misled by the salesman.

But
lack of knowledge and information at the time meant Spencer went back 
to the same surgeon a further three times after the initial poor 
outcome.

Two years later and £30,000
poorer and his hairline was in no better state - in fact he needed 
corrective surgery to fix what had been done because it looked 
unnatural.

The
surgery he opted to have done was, at the time, perceived as good and 
state of art - there was no Internet around to check what he should 
expect and no easily accessible experts to speak to.

After
the four procedures of mini and micro grafts hair transplants Spencer 
was left with unnatural-looking clumps of hair along hairline.

Worse still, Spencer felt he had to face the struggle alone.

He had met Natalie when the two were travelling and she had no idea he was suffering from hair loss.

But when they were about to buy their first home together, Spencer told her he needed to talk to her about something serious.

Natalie
says: 'I had no idea what he we going to tell me and having just put 
the deposit down on a house, I was worried he was going to tell me it was 
all over or he'd met someone else.

'The first thing he did was reassure me 
that he wasn't about to finish with me, then he told me the whole story -
that he'd started losing his hair in his late teens, had undergone lots
of botched operations costing thousands of pounds and was, at the time,
having extensive restorative treatment in New York.

'My
first instinct was relief. It all made sense - Spencer's hatred of me 
touching his hair, his frequent trips to New York which he told me were 
to see a friend. At the time I had no reason to think he was lying - he 
did have a friend in the city and I thought he just liked styling his 
hair in a particular way. 

'Every time I tried to touch his hair he'd 
push my hand away.'

Spencer waited until his relationship with Natalie had properly developed before letting her in on his biggest secret.

'Nobody knew. Only my mother and sister knew,' he said. 'But even though it's something very sensitive to me, Natalie needed to know when our relationship started getting a lot more serious and we were getting a lot closer.'

Two years after his confession, the couple got engaged. A year later they were married and they now
have a beautiful pair of five-year-old twins, Lily and Alfie.

But Natalie says his confession rattled her at first.

'After the initial relief his confession began to hit home, the worry started to settle in,' said Natalie.

'What
damage was this doing to his scalp? How much treatment could he take? 
If it failed, what would the impact be? And how was this all affecting 
him mentally?

'In terms of the money he was spending, it didn't bother me at all', said Natalie.

'Spencer's always worked hard and it 
was cash he'd earned. I understood that this was something really 
personal to him, and whilst on the outside he exuded confidence, deep 
down his self-esteem was really low and restoring his hair would bring 
the confidence back.

'I was by his side to support him 
during each new round of surgery and thankfully, it all went well.

'Each time
though, my heart did sink and the old fears would come back - about it 
failing and harming him physically and mentally.

Spencer was self-conscious of the unnatural results

His saviour came in the form of New York surgeon Dr Feller who performed a brilliant procedure to fix his hairline for good.

Spencer since launched his website 
SpexHair, offering what he says is 'honest, ethical hair loss help from 
hair loss treatments to hair transplants'.

'When Spencer had finished his last round of
surgery I was so pleased it was over and amazed at how he looked,' Natalie says.

'Anyone meeting Spencer for the first time would have no idea what he's 
been through. I felt delighted for him.

'This is what 
Spencer had been searching for, for years. Overnight his self-confidence
and belief in himself improved and he became a different, more 
self-assured person. 

'We 
only started telling friends a couple of years ago. They have been 
incredibly supportive, he's had the banter you'd expect from close 
mates, but no negativity at all.

'In fact we've found some wanting to 
talk to us about the whole process because they're thinking of having 
the same treatment.

'I'm 
really proud of Spencer and the journey he's been on.

'He's a more 
confident and relaxed person now than when we first met and feels 
comfortable in his own skin.

'Now he's come out and people know about the
hair loss, he feels as though a big burden has been lifted. He isn't 
hiding anymore - he's proud of who he is.

The couple are now married. They now have a beautiful pair of five-year-old twins, Lily and Alfie
