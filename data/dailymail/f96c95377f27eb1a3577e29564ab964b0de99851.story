A teenager who admitted throwing bleach into the face of a 17-year-old model leaving her temporarily blinded and in 'excruciating' pain has been told to prepare for jail.

Victoria Smith, who models under the name Toria Melody, suffered burns across her body after she was attacked when leaving a house party with friends in Hull.

Rebecca Morris, 18, pleaded guilty to maliciously throwing a corrosive fluid, with intent to burn, maim, disfigure or cause grievous bodily harm today at Hull Crown Court.

During the attack in August last year, bleach entered the model's eyes, mouth and nose,  causing her to violently choke.

She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with three of her friends.

After the attack, the Wilberforce Sixth Form College student said: 'One of my eyes is now physically impaired and I am blind in it, I will most likely never receive my vision in my right eye again.

'The outer layer of my eyes are permanently damaged and my hair has turned green from the bleach and has fallen out at the front.

'I have burns on my body from all the acidic chemicals inside the bleach and I am in excruciating pain in my eyes.

'They are red raw, it went in my mouth, up my nose and I couldn't breathe.'

Miss Smith, 17, who models under the name Toria Melody, suffered burns across her body after bleach was thrown into her face

Prosecutor Stephen Welch said a victim impact report provided by Ms Smith showed she complained of significant physical and psychological injury, but the defence disputed that.

'She says in her victim impact statement she has suffered considerable physical and psychological impact as a result of this,' said Mr Welch.

'However, the ophthalmologist says there is no permanent affect. I have asked the police and they say there is no permanent scaring left on the complainant. The Crown's case is she did make a full physical recovery. 

'However, there are a number of elements of psychological harm that have result in this case. The defence dispute that.'

Defence barrister Ian Phillip said proceeding without checking her statement with doctors and psychologists could mean an injustice would be done.  

Judge David Tremberg adjourned the hearing as he said that there was no accurate information about the harm that Morris caused. 

He said: 'It is most important when you are sentenced the court has accurate information about the harm you have caused. That information is not available yet.

'I am going to adjourn for that. I can give you no indication of your sentence yet. However, you should prepare yourself for the very real possibility of a custodial sentence.'

The model said she endured seven years of bullying at school, and feared the attack would ruin the confidence she had managed to rebuild since starting college.

She said: 'It took me a year to finally start leaving my house and going to college after not going to school for more than a year and being so terrified of people after being bullied for over seven years.

'This has 100 per cent set me back and I honestly cannot see myself coming out again for a long time after realising just how cruel bullies nowadays really are.' 

Hundreds of wellwishers commented on her Facebook post after reading details of the attack.

One said: 'I don't know you, but you are a shining star writing this showing that these bullies haven't defeated you. Well done, you are a beautiful girl too, don't let bullies make you feel low.'

Miss Smith later responded: 'Thank you everyone so so much for all your support! It means the world to me I really appreciate it.

'Don't know what I'd do without you all honestly, every single one of you have helped me a lot.' 

Morris, from west Hull, was bailed and ordered to attend court again on Friday when she will be sentenced. 

The teenage model was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary with three of her friends after the attack
