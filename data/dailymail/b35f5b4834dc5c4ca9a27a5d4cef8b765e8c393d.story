Sting and wife Trudie Styler say they are looking forward to making Battersea Power Station their new London home and have bought an apartment

It has been billed as the way to transform and preserve one of London's best-loved landmarks by creating housing for thousands of people and panoramic views across the capital. 

And now Battersea Power Station has proved its new apartments are in fact fit for a rock star. 

Sting and wife Trudie Styler have confirmed they will be among the future tenants living among the redeveloped towers. 

The couple have bought an apartment at the iconic landmark as their new London base, adding to their extensive global property portfolio. 

It has not been confirmed if the apartment will be in or next to the actual power station. 

But with Sting's impressive fortune the couple are likely to have purchased one of the apartments at the higher end of the scale, where prices peak at £3million for a four bedroom house.

Their new home could even be a penthouse for which prices have not been released, but are are available on request. Experts have predicted they could cost as much as £30million. 

The couple have already bought multi-million properties in Malibu, New York, Tuscany, north London and Wiltshire. They also put one of their London homes, on the Mall, on sale for £15 million earlier this year.

Styler said: 'The exciting development plans for the whole site are a great solution for the regeneration of an iconic London landmark which has been in decay for the last 30 years.

'We are both very pleased to be part of this new community and really look forward to making our London home at the Battersea Power Station.'

The couple announced they had purchased the apartment as Sting performed to 300 people in New York at an event to publicise the development.

Rob Tincknell, CEO of Battersea Power Station Development Company, said: 'I am thrilled that Trudie and Sting have chosen Battersea Power Station as their London home and really hope they enjoy being part of this exciting development.'

The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station, which is costing £8bn, will see the 42 acre site transformed into a riverside town for thousands of people.

After years of failed bids to redevelop it, the he site was bought by Real Estate Opportunities and the project was given planning permission in 2010. It is expected to be completed by 2025. 

The power station itself, which has been closed to the public for 30 years, is expected to be opened in 2019.

Apartments in the power station vary widely in price and size, studios available from £495,000, one bedroom apartments being sold for £595,000 and four bedroom apartments for £3million.

At the heart of the scheme called Prospect Place, will be Gehry's Flower building - a striking structure which will offer residents a lounge, library, a large chef's table dining room, a yoga studio and treatment rooms.

London-based Foster + Partners have designed a building inspired by the 1930s which will be topped by one of the city's largest roof gardens offering spectacular panoramic views of London.

The development will also house 103 affordable homes.

The redevelopment of Battersea Power Station will create 15,000 new jobs, 3,500 new homes and a privately-funded extension of the London Underground at Nine Elms and Battersea Power Station.
