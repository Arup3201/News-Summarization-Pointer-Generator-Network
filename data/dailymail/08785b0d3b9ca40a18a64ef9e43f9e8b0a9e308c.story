Melbourne has proven it's not just about coffee and cricket after it was named Monocle Magazine's third most liveable city, drawing praise for its public transport and low crime rates.

The Victorian capital was knocked off its 2013 second-place perch by Tokyo, Japan - which climbed two spots from last year.

Sydney trailed behind in 11th place and Brisbane made its debut at spot number 25.

Melbourne came in third place on Monocle magazine's 25 most livable cities

Known for its coffee and cricket, Monocle cited Melbourne's public transport, low crime rates and 'compelling' weekend paper as big pluses

Denmark's Copenhagen held onto its top spot for a second year in a row.

The London-based magazine cited Melbourne's recent upgrades to its public transport system, its low crime rate and even its inclusion of 'a compelling new weekend paper' as reasons why it made the top-three cut.

But according to Monocle, Melbourne had the highest murder rate on its index of 25 cities.

Just over half way down the list, Sydney - which held ninth place last year - took a tumble for its public transport woes and bar lockouts introduced in early 2014 in parts of the city after the 'king hit' death of Thomas Kelly.

But the Harbour city still held a special place in Monocle's heart.

'Sydney remains Australia's face to the world - and a pretty one at that,' it said.

'Architectural breakthroughs such as the North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club and One Central Park are welcome additions.'

Brisbane came to the attention of the international list maker after it was named as the host city of November's G20 summit.

'Arriving delegates will discover a sun-drenched destination with a flourishing start-up scene,' Monocle said of the Queensland capital.

But despite the comprehensive criteria used to assess the cities from mobile phone charging points to the number of fast food chains to the amount of rubbish recycled, there is some data that can be called into question.

The publication claims Sydney enjoys 2592 'sunshine hours', not offering a timeframe. But according to the Bureau of Meteorology, Sydney Airport recorded an average of 7.8 hours of sun a day in 2013, which works out to be 2847 hours a year.

Monocle also listed Sydney had only 42 book shops but a directory search reveals there are at least 188 listed in the Sydney CBD alone.

The number of daily newspapers in a city is also taken into account - four in Sydney and three in Melbourne - but the magazine ignores that millions get their news fix online.

Surprisingly old favourites London and New York were a no-show on the Monocle rankings, with the magazine cheekly writing London police 'can't always be trusted' and did not elaborate.

Topping the list was Copenhagen for its easy living and cosmopolitan, but down-to-earth, atmosphere.

'Living in Copenhagen is easy. It’s pretty safe, it’s simple to get around whether you walk or ride your bicycle and you have a lot of good restaurants, bars, cinemas, museums, parks, canals and beaches,' Monocle said.

'It has an international – though local – feel to it; living there you consider yourself a part of the world but still very Danish.'

Second place getter, Tokyo, secured its spot with a great food, arts and shopping scene.
