A daredevil B&B owner survived a 45 minute ordeal after becoming trapped in the tangled wreckage of her microlight - just two years after suffering a near identical accident.

Marilyn Nichols, who is in her 50s, suffered serious leg wounds when the aircraft she was flying with husband Bill plummeted in Derbyshire on Tuesday.

Despite the catalogue of injuries and terrifying wait to be freed, plucky Marilyn was seen cracking jokes from her hospital bed only hours after the crash.

While Bill, in his 60s, escaped with minor injuries, Marilyn, who runs the Haddon House Farm guesthouse in Bakewell, Derbyshire, was trapped in the wreckage for 45 minutes and had to be rescued by emergency workers.

Lucky escape: Marilyn Nichols was trapped in the wreckage of her microlight for around 45 minutes after it crashed near Ashbourne, Derbyshire

She is now recovering in hospital in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, having suffered four broken vertebrae, a broken finger, a broken wrist and damaged lungs

Mr Nichols recalled the ordeal.

He said: 'We were climbing slowly and it all went wrong at 70 feet and we just spun into the ground.

'We’re both very lucky, especially to have survived two crashes. I have walked away from both with no injury.

'She’s had two surgeries now for her injuries, but she’s in good spirits, you’ll never get her down

'She’s already talking about going back up again soon, but to be honest I’m not so sure, it seems like tempting fate a bit now.

'She was in control while we were taking off, but unfortunately when it went wrong she just froze at the controls, I tried to grab them but there was nothing that could be done at that height.

'It’s a shame, the aircraft had only done 100 hours since we got it in February.

'If we had been in any other microlight we wouldn’t be here now, the French-made one we used took a huge amount of the impact.'

Trapped: Marilyn Nichols was trapped inside her microlight for 45 minutes. She suffered multiple fractures

The smash came almost exactly two years to the day since Marilyn broke both ankles in a microlight crash in Cheshire.

Nick Case, a member of a microlight internet forum wrote: 'Crikey, lightning appears to have struck twice! Unfair!

'Most unfair, two less deserving people I find hard to imagine.

'But if anyone can bounce back from two crashes it’s Marilyn.

The air ambulance was scrambled to Calton Moor Airstrip, near Ashbourne, Derbyshire, after the Nichols’ microlight crashed while attempting to take off at around 12.35pm on Tuesday.

West Midlands Ambulance Service said Mrs Nichols had suffered `multiple serious leg injuries in the crash, and suspected pelvic injuries’.

She was airlifted to University Hospital North Staffordshire for emergency treatment, while husband Bill, who suffered multiple minor injuries, was taken to the same hospital by land ambulance.

The injured couple run a five star farmhouse B&B on the ancient Haddon Hall estate in the Peak District.
