If you've ever watched a James Bond film and thought you could do better job at thwarting villains, then this is the game for you. 

GCHQ, the British intelligence agency,  has set a new challenge to find to find the best computer hackers in the country - who could one day protect Britain from real cyber terror attacks.

It has launched an online game to test cyber warriors’ abilities to stop a fictional attack – and top scorers will be invited to take part in secret face-to-face reconnaissance missions.

Winners of past missions have gone on to work for GCHQ as a real operative, MailOnline can reveal.

Would-be spooks can register online for the chance to take part. 

In the game, called Assignment: Astute Explorer, they must protect a fictitious aerospace technology company threatened by imminent attack from imaginary cyber terrorists called The Flag Day Associates.

As part of the elaborate game, players can watch a ‘threat video’ posted by The Flag Day Associates on YouTube - again, mimicking real-life situations that operatives are faced with.

Hundreds of people have already analysed a made-up hard drive belonging to Ebell Technologies – an imaginary aerospace and electrical engineering company, which makes military and civilian aircraft and wind turbines.

Players of the game must protect a fictitious aerospace technology company threatened by imminent attack from cyber terrorists called The Flag Day Associates.

As part of the elaborate game, players can watch a ‘threat video’ posted by The Flag Day Associates on YouTube.

Hundreds of people have already analysed a made-up hard drive belonging to Ebell Technologies – an imaginary aerospace and electrical engineering company, which makes military and civilian aircraft and wind turbines.

The story goes that Ebell are concerned about the threat of an imminent attack and have asked GCHQ operatives (the public playing the game) to assess the scale of the threat.

For this part of the challenge, players must identify vulnerabilities in snippets of code hidden on the hard drive and explain how they could be exploited – as well as suggest how they could be fixed.

Now, people are being encouraged to take part in the next part of the Cyber Security Challenge UK game, which is designed to give members of the public a chance to experience what it is like to be a GCHQ operative.

A source told MailOnline that the task has been devised using technology used by GCHQ in real life to make the experience as realistic as possible.

High flyers in the task will get the chance to take part in a reconnaissance meet up at secret locations around the UK.

‘In the upcoming face-to-face competition, winners of the GCHQ contest will be paired into teams to fight a real-time "cyber-attack" on simulated critical infrastructure,’ he said.

They will use laptops to ‘hack’ into encrypted systems and uncover details about ‘people behind the masks’ in the imaginary scenario.

While the competition aims to give lots of people a taste of what it takes to work for the British intelligence service, it is also a chance for individuals to attract the attention of employers.

Past participants took part in a  a realistic cyber-attack on the London Stock Exchange – in the historic setting of the Cabinet War Rooms in Westminster

Past face-to-face challenges have included teams competing to hack into an airport’s CCTV networks and take control of a remote-controlled military drone.

In another scenario, high-flying hackers had to work together as a team of 42 to prevent a realistic cyber-attack on the London Stock Exchange – in the historic setting of the Cabinet War Rooms in Westminster, which were used during World War Two.

While the competition aims to give lots of people a taste of what it takes to work for the British intelligence service, it is also a chance for individuals to attract the attention of employers.

'Astute Explorer is an ingenious game from GCHQ which will not only provide an enjoyable challenge but will test skills that are in high demand by employers in this sector,' said Stephanie Daman, CEO of the Cyber Security Challenge. 

'I would encourage anyone with an interest in how IT systems and the information they hold can be protected to sign up and give it a go.'
