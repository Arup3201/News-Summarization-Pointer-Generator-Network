These shocking pictures show the scenes faced by Britain's toughest crew of cleaners - who tidy up after hoarders, drug addicts and suicides.

Rob
 Hampton, 56, and his 'iron-stomached' employees wear masks and hazardous material 
suits to clear up needles, excrement, blood and human remains from properties which have been left to ruin.

The 
five-strong team from R&M Cleaners in Camborne, Cornwall, are called
 in by landlords and local authorities when the job is too harrowing for
 normal firms.

Filthy! This photo shows a typical job for R&M Cleaners in Camborne in Cornwall, whose cleaners are called to work on some of the dirtiest houses in the region. Pictured here is a house where a mother lived with three children, which was filled with old food tins, dirty dishes and moldy food packets

The cleaners are regularly called to drug dens and squats where they have had to remove human waste and bloody syringes.

They are also called in by police in the aftermath of deaths and suicides to scrub away remains and kill deadly viruses.

Mr Hampton and his team are also regularly asked to remove several tonnes of junk from the homes of hoarders - and once even found a donkey living in an abandoned property.

Mr Hampton said: 'Our staff need iron stomachs as the smells are often really bad.

'We deal with toilets filled to the brim, houses that are several feet deep in rubbish and basically any kind of horrible scenario you can imagine.

'There was one job we did where a man had died and hadn't been discovered for three months. His body had begun to decompose and there were bodily fluids everywhere.

Dirty: This scene is not unusual for Rob Hampton and his team of cleaners, who are called in to scrub the dirtiest houses when the job is too tough for landlords or councils. This is the grotty bathroom in a house where people lived with 10 kittens and was one of the dirtiest houses the team has cleaned

Not a pretty sight: As well as cleaning drug dens and squats, the cleaning team faces a hard task trying to clean up some of the disgusting houses around the area. This is just one example of the type of kitchen they might be expected to clean

Rubbish! Old DVDs, used bottles, shredded paper and cardboard boxes are strewn across a bed in a house which used to be lived in by a mother and three children. Mr Hampton and his wife Tracey founded the firm in 1994 to tackle 'extreme cleans', which can include being called to a home in the aftermath of a suicide

What a mess! An example of a messy flat which the extreme cleaning firm from Cornwall must clean. The team must also protect themselves from viruses such Norovirus, bird flu, swine flu or SARS, which can be rife in the properties

Rob
 says his most dangerous job came after his team were dispatched to 
clean the home of a drug dealer and several former customers tried to 
break in to buy drugs.

Rob founded R&M Cleaners with his wife Tracey in 1994. Their son Oliver is also on the staff.

They
 do all the normal jobs associated with the cleaning industry but 
decided they would focus on carrying out 
so-called 'extreme cleans'.

They
 are trained to carry out 'crime and scene trauma cleaning', remove 
deadly bio-hazards and can even disinfect properties infected with 
Norovirus, bird flu, swine flu or SARS.

Rob
 says his most dangerous job came after his team were dispatched to 
clean the home of a drug dealer and several former customers tried to 
break in to buy drugs.

He
 said: 'We are often sent in to drug dens by local housing associations 
and have carried out quite a few clearances where tenants have either 
been evicted or done a runner.

This kitchen was so dirty that mold have covered many of the work surfaces. Leftover saucepans filled with liquid are also often left lying around, which must be disposed of by the extreme cleaning team

Protected! Oliver Hampton (left) from R&M Cleaners, whose father and mother set up the business, dresses up in his protective clothing before braving some of the messiest houses in the region. This sometimes includes former drug dens, where it is not unusual for used needles to be scattered around (right)

'After a suicide or a death the body will be taken away but there are often bits left behind.

'We wear fully protective clothing as you never know what's going to be in the property. We're properly booted and suited.

'We've seen just about everything but sometimes the jobs are so bad they even make us gag - we're still human after all.'

Rob Hampton, who works at the firm with his wife Tracey and son Oliver, removes two dead birds from a property left behind by tenants. The firm often has to disinfect properties which have been infected with Norovirus, bird flu, swine flu or SARS

That's better! This photo shows a disgusting toilet before it was cleaned by R&M Cleaners, compared with the shining surface of the toilet once the expert cleaners have attacked it

The team has been responsible for cleansing countless drugs dens since the company was founded.

Mr Hampton said: 'As we all know, Cornwall has quite a big drug problem. We are 
often sent in to drugs dens by local housing associations and have 
carried out quite a few clearances where tenants have either been 
evicted or done a runner.

'In
 some cases we've found rooms littered with needles that we then have to
 sanitise and kill potential viruses such as hepatitis B or HIV.'

Full of rubbish! This disgusting house had boxes of rubbish thrown across the floor, as well as old tins and food packed into drawers. Rob said his team needs 'iron stomachs' to deal with the stench and sight of some of the properties they are called to clean
