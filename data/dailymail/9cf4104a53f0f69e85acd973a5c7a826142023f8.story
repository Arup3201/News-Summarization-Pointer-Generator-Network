Real Madrid completed a 9-1 aggregate rout of third tier side Cornellà thanks to an exhibition first half from James Rodriguez and Isco.

Carlo Ancelotti’s team were already 4-0 up in the Spanish Cup round of 32 game and were able to field a weakened team with Cristiano Ronaldo watching from his VIP box with young son Cristiano Ronaldo Junior.

The Cup holders also had 22-year-old third choice keeper Fernando Pachecho in goal and gave a rare start to frustrated Manchester United loanee Javier Hernandez.

But it was two first-teamers who stole the show. James scored after 16 minutes with a lob over Cornellà keeper Iñigo Alberto after being set-up by Isco. And the Colombian repaid the favour on 34 minutes with a stunning through ball that Isco scored from.

Chicharito Hernandez was desperate to get in on the act in the first half but missed the perfect chance on the half hour when his effort from Fabio Coentrao’s cross was saved.

He made amends moments later with a delightful flick on the edge of the area to set up James for goal number three. All this after Madrid had so nearly fallen behind. Captain for the night Alvaro Arbeloa clumsily bundled over Xavi Boniquet but the Cornellà forward picked himself up and blasted the penalty over the bar when the scores were still at 0-0.

The Santiago Bernabeu was only a third full for the second leg despite Madrid have drastically dropped prices. Behind the South goal a huge banner read ‘no to violence, no to racism, one sentiment: Madridismo’ in response to the violence that preceded Sunday’s Atletico Madrid Deportivo match leaving one man dead.

The rest of the stadium applauded when the banner was unfurled. Also greeted by huge applause was the return of Jese Rodriguez who injured his right knee eight months ago cutting short what was turning into an exception first season that could even have won him a place at last summer’s World Cup.

Jese finally came on in the 65th minute when Sami Khedria went off concused after clashing with Israel Delgado.

Madrid made it 8-1 on aggregate when Borja Lopez put through his own net after Chicharito’s clever lob came back off the cross-bar – the United man so nearly get the goal he wanted but the last touch was definitely the defender’s.

He had another chance shortly afterwards when Jese’s run and cross played him in but he just failed to make contact. Jese got on the scoresheet himself shortly after to mark his comeback in style. It was Isco – who else – who played the pass and the winger converted to celebrate his return after 258 days out of action and make it 9-1 over the two legs.
