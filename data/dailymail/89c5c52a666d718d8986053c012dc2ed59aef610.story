'The victim went into cardiac arrest and later died as a result of the altercation,' a police statement reads.

Tran's teenage daughter was arrested on Friday. She is being held at Santa Clara County Juvenile Hall on suspicion of involuntary manslaughter.

The girl hasn't been named because of her age.

Involuntary manslaughter is charged as a felony offense in California and the maximum punishment includes up to four years in jail and a fine of $10,000. It's not clear whether authorities plan to charge the teen as an adult.
