From fake tanning to applying false eyelashes, getting ready for a night on the town can be time consuming.

And the glamorous ladies of Liverpool know how to do it best according to the latest research which revealed they spend the longest amount of time in the entire country getting ready for a big night out.

The well-groomed women of Merseyside topped the survey with 46 per cent spending more than three hours on average getting dolled up before going out.

Abbey Clancy, a notorious Liverpool glamour lady, is an example of the three hours of effort the northern girls put in before a night out compared with the ladies of Susan Boyle's hometown of West Lothian

And it isn't just the ladies of the north topping the chart.

Women from Nottinghamshire (31 per cent), Bedfordshire (25 per cent), Oxfordshire (20 per cent); and - perhaps surprisingly - Essex, which scraped into fifth place, admit to spending more than three hours getting ready for a night out.

The study, carried out by beauty site Escentual.com, revealed the five areas spending the least amount of time grooming as Humberside, and Susan Boyle’s home town West Lothian in Scotland, where a staggering 75 per cent of female respondents said they spent 15 minutes or less before going out.

Also taking the bottom spots were Clywd, Wales, where 95 per cent of respondents said they spent less than 45 minutes, Derbyshire, (50 per cent less than 45 mins), and West Midlands (37 per cent less than 45 minutes).

Surprisingly, Essex took a mere fifth place in the ranks, despite being home to the glamorous TOWIE stars who are famous for their beauty regimes

Liverpool, home of reality TV show Desperate Scousewives, is rightly famous for its glamour.

Scouse girls including Colleen Rooney and Alex Curran are often spotted wearing rollers at the Albert Dock during the day before a big night out.

Nottingham, in second place, is well known for its nightlife, but Bedfordshire – birthplace of Carol Vorderman - came an unlikely third.

Women from Berkshire, home of the Duchess of Cambridge, spend just 45 minutes perfecting their natural look

Most surprising, perhaps, was that Essex, home of glamorous The Only Way is Essex girls Samantha Faiers and Jessica Wright, could only scrape into fifth place despite having a glamorous reputation as spiritual home of the vajazzle, big hair and fake tanning.

Emma Leslie, Escentual.com’s Beauty editor, said: 'We always see strong sales from the Liverpool area, with the most popular products being false eyelashes and bronzing powders for the high glamour look, so it’s not totally surprising that Merseyside topped the poll.

'Essex was surprisingly only fifth for women spending more than three hours getting ready. Again, it’s got a very glamorous image to maintain thanks to shows like TOWIE and great nightlife and closeness to London.

'But, surprisingly, it was pipped to the top by Nottinghamshire, Bedfordshire and Oxfordshire. It could be because Essex girls have their beauty and going out regimes so well planned.'

Emma added: 'There’s no magic number that is going to mean you’re ready to go out. We always say at Escentual.com it’s about whatever works for our customers. For some women glamming themselves up is an important part of the whole night out experience, often with friends. While others just prefer to feel more comfortable and chose a more natural look.'
