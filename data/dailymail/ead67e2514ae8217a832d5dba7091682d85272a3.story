Hi there
beauty chums. I'm trying my best to stay smiley but you have to agree it’s been a pretty glum summer so far - rain, rain, freezing
wind, and more rain. Until we finish work on this series of Made In Chelsea I
can't even jet off to the sunshine. Boo!

So to
cheer myself up this week, I invited the girls round for a make-up party. As a
beauty blogger, I am very lucky to get sent tons of products to test. We had
all sorts of girly fun trying out new make-up colours and ideas, and it gave me
the chance to experiment with one of this year's biggest beauty looks:
attention-grabbing eyebrows.

I've
blogged before about eyebrow grooming, and what a huge impact shaping your
brows can have on your overall look. A professional session with a brow waxer
or threader leaves you looking elegant and polished in no time.

Bigger is better: This week Binky had the chance to experiment with one of this year's biggest beauty looks: attention-grabbing eyebrows to look like Cara Delevingne

Semi-permanent make-up treatments can also boost a brow depleted
by years of plucking and I had a treatment with one of the UK's leading experts Debra Robson and she really created a much stronger framing of my brow
with her Power Brow treatment. You can see the difference in the before and
after shots.

It's not
just about well-groomed eyebrows though. Cara Delevingne has been THE hot model
for the last 18 months, and her thick, bold brows have prompted a major beauty
trend. I'm lucky enough to have a nice healthy pair, but there's always room
for improvement. Hence this week's subject: Binky's Bold Brows

How To Do Bold Eyebrow Makeup With Binky

Step 1:
Apply your base

Brows are
the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make-up look.
The Vichy
Dermablend Dermasmooth Corrective Foundation creates a wonderfully even, matte base. It's quite thick,
so you only need to apply a little to conceal shadows and achieve a smooth
finish. Dab a little foundation onto the back of your hand, then apply it to
the face using a foundation brush and blend with your fingers.

Step 2:
Highlight your eyes

Get the look: Brows are the focus of this look - obvs - so you just want a simple nude make-up look

The eyes
need to be subtle, so as not to distract from your bold brows. So I've used
this pretty bareMinerals eyeshadow in Chic Nude just to add a hint of sparkle.
Apply the eyeshadow using a small, angled brush, blending it across the whole
eyelid and in the tear duct to brighten your eyes and create a flattering wash
of pale, shimmery colour.

Step 3:
Add a darker shade

It’s always nice to add a little definition to your eyes, so
apply a soft line of the bareMinerals Sable eyeshadow along the upper and lower
lash lines and into the crease of your eyelid using a small brush. bareMinerals
eyeshadows are packed with colour and a little goes a long way, so be careful
when applying this darker shade as you don't want to overdo it.

Step 4:
Luscious lashes

Finish
off your eyes by emphasising your lashes - both upper and lower - with a couple
of coats of mascara. The slimline brush on the Clarins Wonder Length Mascara is
especially good for lengthening your lashes, so the results look natural but
lush.

Step 5:
Tidy and wax your brows

Now for
the brows. If you've not used brow wax before, don't be afraid - it's a
brilliant way to groom your brows, smoothing the shape and fixing the brow
hairs in place. Simply use the small mascara brush that comes with the Clarins Pro-Palette Eyebrow Kit to blend the wax from the
palette into your brows.

Step 6:
Shape and darken

The best
way to achieve a bold yet natural finish is to apply your brow colour in tiny
strokes. I used the small angled brush and the darker brow colour from the
Clarins palette, but there's a lighter shade to choose if you have fair hair.
Gently build up the colour until you achieve the desired shape and thickness.

Wax lyrical: If you've not used brow wax before, don't be afraid - it's a brilliant way to groom your brows, smoothing the shape and fixing the brow hairs in place

Step 7:
Highlight your brows

Next use
the pinky colour from the brow palette, blending it underneath your eyebrows.
This is a clever little make-up trick that helps highlight your brow bones and
adds more definition to the eyes.

Step 8:
Brush on your bronzer

Finally,
its bronzer time - my favourite! Blend Guerlain Terracotta
4 Seasons Bronzer
across the cheekbones and along the side of the forehead using a large powder brush.

You know how much I adore wearing bronzer but for this look I've taken things
easy and not added too much as it might draw attention away from the eyes.

And
that's it - eight easy steps to brilliantly bold brows! I didn’t add anything to my lips for this look, but for a sheer
and subtle touch of lip colour I’d recommend a moisturising lip
butter like Rodial Glamstick in the shade Lust.

I'd
definitely recommend investing in the Clarins brow palette to keep your brows
looking super-groomed.

However, those of you on a budget could try these lower
cost brow boosters: Revlon
Eye Brow Fill-In Powder, £2.69, MUA Brow
Kit, £3.50, No.7 Brow
Perfector, £8.50.

Enjoy!
Love Binky xx
