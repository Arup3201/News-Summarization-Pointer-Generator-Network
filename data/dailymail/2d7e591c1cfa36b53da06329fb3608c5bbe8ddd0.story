Heston Blumental is known for his wacky use of ingredients like snail porridge and his michellin-starred restaurants.

But customers have snubbed the celebrity chef in the latest food awards by TripAdvisor.

His restaurant The Fat Duck failed to crack the top ten for fine dining, while rival Raymond Blanc’s restaurant Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons was named the UK’s favourite.

Le Manoir is also the only British restaurant to be named among the top ten favourites in the world.

He said 'I am thrilled that we have been awarded both these wonderful accolades! They are huge achievements for the team and me at Le Manoir. It has always been imperative that we listen to our guests’ feedback to help us exceed their expectations and it inspires us to continue to strive for perfection.'

It’s a setback for Blumenthal having bested other big name rivals in previous years to take the coveted top spot in the Good Food guide and the Fat Duck was the only restaurant to be awarded ten out of ten.

The Duck was the bespectacled chef’s first restaurant when he opened it back in 1995 and he soon garnered a reputation for using chemistry in the kitchen.

Outlandish dishes like egg and bacon ice cream saw the cook well on his way to three Michelin stars.

Gordon Ramsey's The Restaurant was snubbed but there was some consolation for the TV chef as his London-based Petrus came third.

Elsewhere the awards spell good news for UK chefs.

Second in the country was Devon’s Gidleigh Park in Chagford.

French chef Raymond Blanc has welcomed news that customers ranked his restaurant top in the UK for fine dining. His restaurant Le Manoir was also the only British restaurant to make the world list

Head chef Michael Caines has extra reason to crack out the champagne there as the two Michelin-starred restaurant, housed in a Tudor-style manor and set in 55 acres of woodland, also comes ninth in Europe.

TripAdvisor’s James Kay said ‘This year’s list of Travellers’ Choice Restaurants award winners proves just how diverse fine dining experiences have become across the UK.

Whether you’re as far north as Auchterarder or as far south as Jersey, you’ll be able to find a Travellers’ Choice winner close by.’

1. Le Manoir Aux Quat’Saisons, Great Milton, Oxfordshire, England2. Gidleigh Park, Chagford, Devon, England3. Petrus, London, England4. Lumiere, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, England5. Andrew Fairlie @ Gleneagles, Auchterarder, Scotland6. Ocean Restaurant, St. Brelade, Jersey, Great Britain7. The Ledbury, London, England8. Castle Terrace, Edinburgh, Scotland9. Maison Bleue Restaurant, Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, England10. Le Gavroche, London, England

It wasn't only Britain's top chefs who failed to make the cut and René Redzepi will be licking his wounds after his restaurant Noma in Copenhagen missed out.

The world’s number one restaurant is the three Michelin starred Maison Lameloise.

Perhaps not surprisingly it is located in France which is considered the culinary home of fine dining.

Customers were impressed by its prices which start at £56 per person for a weekday lunch.

Restaurants in the US, Spain, China, Greece, Italy, Brazil and the Dominican Republic complete the worlds’ top ten.

There is irony in the awards list since before opening the Fat Duck, Blumenthal had actually previously worked for a week at Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat' Saisons in Oxfordshire.

Le Manoir Aux Quat'Saisons has two Michelin stars and the Oxfordshire eatery was founded by Blanc himself in 1994.

It was also used for filming the BBC2's reality show The Restaurant and prices there start at £79 a head.
