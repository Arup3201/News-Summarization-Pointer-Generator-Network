Britain could be hit by power cuts next winter because the electricity supply is already ‘close to its limits’, experts warn.

Capacity
 is so stretched that a cold spell, combined with routine problems at 
one or more plants, could overwhelm the system and see blackouts in 
2014-15, their damning report claims.

A
 major pressure on the National Grid is the forced closure of coal-fired
 power stations to meet European green directives, the Royal Academy of 
Engineering says.

But the drive to 
low-carbon power from wind farms and new nuclear power stations ‘will 
come at a cost’ and the authors call for politicians to be honest with 
the public about it.

Ed
 Miliband has promised to freeze energy prices for 20 months if Labour 
wins the 2015 General Election but the report, commissioned by the Prime
 Minister’s Council for Science and Technology, says the major power 
firms already lack the certainty about prices to invest in 
desperately-needed new capacity, and will find it difficult to secure 
supply in future while trying to keep bills low.

Two
 of the Big Six energy firms have already announced inflation-busting 
price increases this winter, with British Gas’s 9.2 per cent rise 
yesterday following SSE’s 8 per cent rise last week.

For the report, engineers looked at 
capacity in the power network this year, in 2015 and in 2019, and how 
the system would cope during a peak in demand such as that seen during 
the freezing winter of two years ago.

They
 concluded that a combination of adverse conditions is ‘likely to 
stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 
2014-15, increasing the chance of power outages’.

Dr
 John Roberts, chairman of the working group, said these were ‘real sets
 of challenging conditions that have happened before and can be expected
 again in the future’.

However,
 coal and gas-fired power stations are being forced to close as they do 
not meet EU regulations on pollution, while four nuclear plants are 
scheduled to be phased out by 2019.

Dr
 Roberts said this ‘would reduce the flexibility of the system and 
increase the chances that otherwise manageable failures could jeopardise
 the country’s power supply’.

But
 Business Minister Michael Fallon insisted: ‘The lights are not going to
 go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but 
stuff is being done.

‘We’ve
 opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You’re going
 to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations.’

The RAE experts interviewed staff at the National Grid, the regulator Ofgem, the Government and the big power firms.

They
 call on ministers to build more gas plants in the coming years, but say
 they must urge operators not to close them before 2015, and pay them to
 generate more capacity.

Ageing gas plants are being closed or mothballed because the high price of gas make them unprofitable.

And
 while coal prices have plummeted, undercut as a result of the shale gas
 boom in the US, around a dozen coal plants will close by 2015 because 
of green directives.

Dame Sue Ion, fellow of the RAE, who 
worked on the report, said: ‘We’re saying that when everything is going 
well there is enough capacity in the system, but if there is a bit of a 
problem such as one or two major stations going down for whatever reason
 and an anticyclone comes from over the Atlantic, then at peak, demand 
will potentially exceed supply.

‘We
 have quite a lot of renewable energy being installed but it is 
intermittent, so unless you have gas to back it up it’s a problem.

Whether
 the turbines are onshore or offshore, if it’s a cold winter that is not
 windy then only a very small amount of energy will be generated.’

Possible closures: Dr John Roberts, chairman of the reports's working group, said several coal and oil-fired power stations could be closed in the next decade if there is no investment

Major investment is 
needed in the electricity network, she said, but the new wave of nuclear
 power stations announced today will not come online until at least 2020
 – leaving a looming gap.

‘In
 the long term we will need a lot more power’, she said. ‘The important 
thing is before any statements are made about fixing prices there have 
to be decisions made about how much investment is needed and how the 
costs of that investment – which do not come from taxation, they come 
out of electricity bills – will be paid for.’

Most
 of the network was built in the 1960s. Since then the population has 
risen by more than 10million – and the use of electricity in transport 
systems and to heat homes has soared.

Dr
 Roberts said: ‘Major investment is needed in the UK’s electricity 
system to achieve a modern, sustainable and secure service that will be 
the foundation of economic growth.

At risk: Leading engineers have warned the country is at a high risk of blackouts over the next five years as the ageing electrical system comes under pressure

‘Government will set the market conditions but it is private industry that will invest the necessary money.

Most
 of the energy companies operating in this country are international 
organisations that will invest in the UK only if it proves to be an 
attractive market.

‘Modernising
 and decarbonising the system will come at a cost, with likely rises in 
the unit price of electricity and difficult decisions will need to be 
made.

It is vital that
 government and industry work together to foster a constructive dialogue
 with the public about the challenges we face.’

George Osborne has signed a deal with China which opens the doors for investors to take control of British nuclear power plants

China will be allowed to own 
and operate a new generation of nuclear power stations in Britain 
despite warnings the move is a ‘serious error’ that could undermine 
national security.

Chancellor
 George Osborne said yesterday he was happy for nuclear firms owned by 
the Chinese state to take a ‘majority stake’ in British power plants.

Billions
 of pounds of investment is  likely to follow, with Chinese firms 
expected to take a major stake in the £14billion Hinkley C reactor 
planned for construction in Somerset.

But
 some experts have warned against giving China a controlling stake in 
the critical industry on national security grounds, arguing that it 
would leave Britain at the mercy of the Communist regime.

There
 are also concerns that the move could give China access to details 
about pressure points in Britain’s energy supplies and other sensitive 
information.

Mark
 Pritchard, a Tory member of Parliament’s national security strategy 
committee, said: ‘Investment is needed, but not at any cost, 
particularly when there are national security implications.

‘I
 don’t have a big problem with Chinese involvement in designing and 
building nuclear power stations but they should not be allowed to 
operate them.

‘It
 would be a serious error to let them have operational control of our 
electricity supply.’ The Chancellor has also faced  criticism from human
 rights groups after failing to raise China’s appalling human rights 
record with officials during a week-long visit.

China’s
 state-controlled People’s Daily yesterday said a British admission that
 it had ‘mishandled’ the issue of Tibet had paved the way for a week 
that has seen Mr Osborne announce a string of Chinese investments in the
 UK.

Chinese companies have been criticised for their lack of transparency in a survey released by an anti-corruption watchdog.

China got the lowest rating of the five major emerging economies, behind India, South Africa, Russia and Brazil.

‘Companies from China lag behind in every dimension with an overall score of 20 per cent,’ Berlin-based Transparency International says.

‘Given their growing influence in world markets, this is of concern.’ Firms were marked on how transparently they present anti-corruption measures and disclose data.

The
 claim was dismissed by Downing Street, which said Britain’s approach to
 Tibet and its spiritual leader the Dalai Lama had ‘not changed’.

Mr Osborne defended the
 planned investment by China, saying: ‘There are many countries in the 
world who wouldn’t want other countries involved in their civil nuclear 
programme – I do, because by the way, if it wasn’t Chinese investment or
 French investment, it would have to be British taxpayers, and I’d 
rather British taxpayers were spending their money on our schools and 
hospitals and those things, and let’s get the rest of the world 
investing in our energy.’

Officials insist the national security implications of extending China’s reach in the UK have been fully considered.

French
 energy firm EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants 
on the Hinkley C project. Initially Chinese companies are likely to hold
 a minority stake in any project, but this could rise over time to a 
majority.
