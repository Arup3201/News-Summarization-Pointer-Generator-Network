It is one of the most poignant moments of modern British history – the dipping of cranes in silent tribute as Winston Churchill’s coffin passes down the Thames.

But there was shock last night after a former docker cast doubt on the spontaneity of the occasion by claiming the workers had to be paid.

John Lynch, a dock man in 1965, made the claim in Jeremy Paxman’s BBC1 documentary, Churchill: The Nation’s Farewell.

A former docker claimed that workers were paid to dip the cranes in silent tribute to Winston Churchill as his coffin passed down The Thames

He said: ‘They [the dockers] didn’t like Churchill. I think I can speak for most, they didn’t like him. When they were asked to do it the atmosphere was “no”. They were paid to do it. We didn’t work Saturday afternoon, we wouldn’t have been there.

‘There was a lot of arguments and rows about it. The atmosphere was that Churchill wasn’t a working class person. You’d see him with a cigar in one hand and sometimes a drink in the other, he just didn’t associate with us at all.’

However, Mr Lynch added: ‘I was [moved by it]. I didn’t like Churchill but I was moved by the gesture. I was moved by the whole funeral.’

After his death from a stroke on January 24, 1965, the wartime prime minister’s coffin was carried from Westminster Hall where it had lain in state for three days to St Paul’s Cathedral.

More than a hundred nations sent representatives, making it the largest state funeral up to that point. The procession then took to the Thames where the Havengore launch carried it from Tower Pier to Festival Pier.

As the boat went down the river the cranes lowered in what has always been described as a spontaneous tribute. Last night viewers reacted with disbelief at the claim.

Annette De Rohan, from Dorset, said: ‘It was shocking to include these claims in an otherwise superb documentary even if there was some truth in them.

‘This attacks the reputation of a great man who we should be holding up to young people as an example. It was very petty.’ Another viewer Angus Fanshawe tweeted: ‘Brilliant and moving Paxman documentary on Churchill funeral. But upset cranes bowing down was not a genuine gesture.’ Historian Guy Walters said: ‘The dock workers at the time were a notorious bunch of hardline socialists, and not all of them would have been the greatest fans of a Tory former prime minister.’

But he added: ‘The fact is, Winston did bring the nation together unlike any other politician.’
