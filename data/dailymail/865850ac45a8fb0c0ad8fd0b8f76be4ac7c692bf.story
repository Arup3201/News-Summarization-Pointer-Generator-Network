Katy Perry knows a dark horse when she sees one. 

The pop star was College GameDay's guest picker on Saturday, and correctly predicted the victory of number 11 ranked Ole Miss over the number 1 team Alabama.

And after the game, she joined fans in a local bar to celebrate the win.

A vine user captured the moment Perry squatted on a local bar, downed a beer and then jumped into a crowd of happy Ole Miss fans at a local watering hole.

Good call: The pop star was College GameDay's guest picker on Saturday, and correctly predicted the upset of number 11 ranked Ole Miss over the number one team, Alabama 

Bring them down! After the upset, thousands of fans stormed the field to take down the goal posts. It was the first time since 2003, when Eli Manning was a senior, that Ole Miss has beaten Alabama 

She also gloated about her good football sense on Twitter, where she posted several tweets about the 23-17 upset.

'I called it!' Perry wrote in one tweet, followed by a picture of Alabama coach Nick Saban looking down in disappointment, with a picture of the singer edited in with her arms up in victory.

Perry was just one of the thousands of Ole Miss fans who celebrated across the Oxford, Mississippi on Saturday. 

After the upset, rowdy fans stormed  the field at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to take down the goal posts and parade them across campus.

Right answer: Perry bragged about her football prediction on Twitter, no doubt losing a few Alabama fans

Ole Miss student Thomas Dillard helped tear down the posts, and told USA Today it was no easy feat.   

'They’re really heavy,' Dillard said. 'I was on the bottom helping push. I think the entire student section brought them down.'

Ole Miss hasn't beat Alabama since 2003, when Eli Manning was in his senior year, and has never in its entire school history upset a number one ranked team.  

They will likely make it into the top 10 this week.
