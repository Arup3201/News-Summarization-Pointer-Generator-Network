Motor racing star Sir Stirling Moss has caused controversy by saying he didn't want 'a poofter or anything like that' to play him in a film.

His comments came during an interview when he said he would like a 'masculine' actor like James Bond actor Daniel Craig to portray him in any biopic.

The 83-year-old Formula One legend then made matters worse by backtracking, claiming he had 'homosexual friends' and that 'there's nothing wrong with it'.

Sir Stirling also said he would need a masculine actor because he had spent his life 'driving cars and chasing girls'.

Today gay and lesbian campaigners condemned him for his homophobia.

Stonewall's Ben Summerskill said: ‘Rugby players like Gareth Thomas, boxers like Orlando Cruz, and any of the brave gay people currently serving their country in Afghanistan might be a little better qualified to comment on masculinity than the accomplished car driver Sir Stirling Moss.’

Human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell said: 'It is a shame that such a great British sporting hero has resorted to this crude homophobic language. Prejudice has no place in any sport.

'Surely Stirling Moss would want himself to be played by the best actor, regardless of their sexuality?'

Sir Stirling's musings on who might play him were sparked at the London Motor Hall of Fame when he heard that the married 
Australian actor Chris Hemsworth was playing the late Formula 1 champion
 James Hunt in a film.

He said: 'I hope the actor would be masculine, not a poofter or anything like that.  Perhaps the guy from Skyfall?'

This afternoon the veteran driving star dug himself a little deeper when he tried to defend his comments.

He told MailOnline: 'Certainly I've got very many friends who are of the different persuasion; I just wouldn't want to be that way and I'm glad I'm not.

'They are not going to make a film about me in any case but if they did, I think someone who's masculine would be better than someone who's effeminate, because I've spent my whole life chasing crumpet and racing cars.

He added: 'That's what I was all about - going around the world and spreading happiness.  It wouldn't obviously work if I was played by that lovely chap Kenneth Williams who played upon being poofy.'

'I'm sorry I've caused offence, but I didn't mean to cause any.  I personally am very grateful to homosexuals because the more of them there are around, the more women are free for me.'

Sir Stirling had a glittering career on the motor-racing circuit, winning 16 Formula One Grands Prix before he retired at 43 in 1962 after a crash left him in a coma for a month.

Known as the 'greatest driver never to win the World Championship', Sir Stirling won millions of fans in the fiercely competitive racing world, loved as much for his character as his driving skills.

He preferred to race British cars, 
saying 'Better to lose honourably in a British car than win in a foreign
 one', and believed the manner in which the race was fought was as 
important as the outcome.

Off
 the track, Sir Stirling was as voracious in his thirst for women as he 
was for motor-racing victory. He and James Hunt were often seen 
surrounded by beautiful admirers in the casinos and nightclubs of Monte 
Carlo.

Many hearts were broken when Sir Stirling married for the first time.  He met his first wife, Canadian brewer's daughter Katie Molson, on the track at Le Mans, and married her at St Peter's, Eaton Square, in 1957.

Their marriage lasted just two years, and in 1964 he married the glamorous American, Elaine Barberino.  But that marriage, too, was not to last, despite her having his daughter Alison, and they divorced in 1968.

It was a question of third time lucky 
for Sir Stirling - in 1980 he married Susie Paine, a young British woman
 practically half his age - and they have a son, Elliot.

But
 being happily married has not made the racing legend boring: last year 
he told an interviewer he enjoyed sex was 'still extremely important to 
me', and said he would like to live for ever, as long as 'I could have 
Susie with me'.

Three years ago, Sir Stirling fell 
three storeys down a lift shaft in his London house, breaking both 
ankles as he landed on its concrete base.  He also broke four bones in 
one foot, chipped some vertebrae, and suffered skin damage in the 
accident in March 2010.

However his spirit was not dented, 
and Lady Moss quipped soon afterwards that he had recovered well enough 
to be complaining about the hospital breakfast.
