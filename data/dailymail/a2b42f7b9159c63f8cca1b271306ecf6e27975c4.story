Addiction: Snooker player Jimmy White, known by his nickname the 'Whirlwind' has admitted to a crack cocaine habit that cost him £10,000 a month. He said that he is 'lucky to be alive' after living the way he did

Disappointment: Jimmy White, right with Ronnie O'Sullivan last year, reached the final of the Snooker World Championship six times but never won. On four occasions he was beaten by Stephen Hendry

In an extract from his new autobiography, Second Wind, which is serialised in the Sun, White told of smoking crack with his close friend and fellow player Kirk Stevens in a hotel room at the Irish Masters.

White's glittering career has seen him win 10 professional ranking tournaments:

2x The Classic (1986, 1991)

2x Grand Prix (1986, 1992)

2x British Open (1987, 1992)

1x Canadian Open (1989)

1x European Open (1992)

1x UK Championship (1992)

1x Players Championship (2004) 

He said: 'I think Kirk tried it first but I'm my own man and I don't blame anyone else for making me do something as stupid as smoking crack. The blame for that lies at my door only.' 

Kirk Stevens, who was accused of taking cocaine during a professional tournament in 1985, admitted his addiction to the drug in a series of newspaper articles published that year. 

Speaking of his own addiction, White added that he was 'lucky to be alive' after graduating from powder cocaine to the more potent crack.

White reached the World Championship, held at the Crucible theatre, Sheffield, in 1984 and in every year from 1990 to 1994 but lost on each occasion. He said that his drug habit cost him 10 world titles. 

And the player admitted that he had 'frittered away' most of the prize money from his illustrious career, during which he has won 23 professional titles including the 1992 UK Championship.

White, who appeared in the 2009 series of I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, said that he had 'one sneaky account with NatWest' that he dipped into to fund his habit. 

He said: 'I did the lot in less than three months. Every penny.'

In the extract he wrote: 'Jimmy White... snooker hero... people's champion... crack addict. Sounds far-fetched, doesn't it? But for about three crazy months it was true.' 

Habit: White, pictured left at a competition in 2010, became a fan-favourite in the 1980s and nineties. The player, who appeared in I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here in 2009 (right) said he 'frittered away' his winnings

'Stupid': White (pictured second from left) said Kirk Stevens (second from right) 'probably tried cocaine first' but said that only he was to blame for his habit. Also pictured above, Tony Knowles (left) and Alex Higgins (right)

White, known as the best snooker player to have never won the championship, has also admitted to battling with alcohol and gambling habits. 

After losing the World Championship Final to Stephen Hendry in 1994, White spent his tournament earnings of £128,000 on gambling - in 24 hours. 

Speaking in a 2008 interview with the Daily Mail, he said: I don't know when I had time to sleep. Or play snooker! I wouldn't ever practise, I was too busy enjoying myself.  

'People's champion': White, pictured during a 2007 tournament, is regarded to be the best player to have never won a world championship. He said that he emptied a bank account in six months funding his habit

Successful: Jimmy White has won 10 professional ranking tournaments in his glittering career, 1984 Masters (pictured above), the 1992 UK Championship and two Grand Prix crowns

'Once I went three days solid without sleep because I was gambling. From 20 to 30, that was my life. I was sick.

He added: 'I've had my dark days, but I wasn't really a hell-raiser as such,' he protested. 'I liked to drink and I liked to party but I never did anyone any harm, never hurt anyone. All I did was hurt myself sometimes.' 

White, also beat testicular cancer after being diagnosed in 1995.
