Nicolas Sarkozy says he may be forced
to stand again as president of France against his wishes because 
Francois Hollande is ‘completely useless’.

The
ex-leader, who was ousted by the Socialists a year ago, said President 
Hollande had displayed a ‘total lack of leadership and his government 
was ‘collapsing'.

Sarkozy’s scathing assessment of the left-wing administration was reported in French daily Le Parisien.

Comeback: Nicolas Sarkozy, with his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, says he may have no choice but to stand for re-election

He said: 'The socialist government is 
falling apart. I am extremely worried. I am also deeply concerned for 
the 1,500 extra people who lose their jobs every day.

'Francois
Hollande is completely useless and has no authority. Our society is 
very fragile and one more straw could collapse it. I could be obliged to
make a comeback.'

His 
comments come only two months after he hinted at standing for 
re-election in 2017 because the socialists were ‘ruining France’.

Dissatisfaction
with President Hollande’s government saw tens of thousands take to 
Paris streets earlier this week on the first anniversary of his election.

Sarkozy
said in March: 'Looking at the disastrous state France risks finding 
itself in in five years time, I will have no choice in 2017.

'The
question is not knowing whether I’m going to make a come-back, but if 
morally I have the choice regarding France to not come back.

'Morally, I can not let the French people down.'

He
and wife Carla Bruni have barely been seen in public since he was 
defeated by socialist Francois Hollande in May’s presidential election.

Sarkozy is now facing corruption charges over illegal campaign funding.

He
is accused of accepting illegal party funding payments from France’s 
richest woman and L’Oreal heiress Lilian Bettencourt in return for tax 
breaks.

Police raided their Paris home in July seeking evidence of corruption.

He
has dismissed the allegations as ‘rubbish’ and after losing the 
election, he and Bruni enjoyed almost eight weeks of uninterrupted 
holidays before making a return to public life.

FRESH BLOW FOR FRENCH ECONOMY

French
industrial output fell by a worse-than-expected 0.9 percent in March 
due to lower production in the farm and transport sectors and a sharp 
drop in refining activity, data showed on Tuesday.

The
monthly fall, in part an adjustment from a 0.8 percent rebound in 
February driven by the restarting of a refinery, was worse than the 0.3 
percent dip predicted by economists in a Reuters poll.

Output
over the first quarter in the moribund industrial sector -- which makes
up about 12 per cent of France’s economy -- was down 0.4 percent 
compared with the previous quarter.

President
Francois Hollande is struggling, a year into his term, to fulfill a 
campaign pledge to pull the industrial sector out of a long slump that 
is driving a steady stream of layoffs. His government said this week 
that measures taken so far to boost competitiveness would take time to 
bear fruit.
