A man has survived after having a pair of fire tongs impaled through his head.

Zhang Xuecheng was on his way home when he was struck by foot-long tool in Taoyuan Town, southern China's Hunan Province.

A shocking X-ray shows how it penetrated the back of his skull and came out his forehead.

How did he survive? This X-ray shows a man's head which was impaled by a pair of fire tongs thrown by someone who was trying to hit a stray dog in Taoyuan Town in southern China's Hunan Province

The tongs had been thrown by a man who was chasing a stray dog that had stolen a piece of bacon.

Zhang was rushed to hospital where doctors operated to remove the metal implement.

Chief surgeon Pu Yuejin said: 'The fire tongs were only a tiny space away from the neck artery, which could have cost his life'.

According to doctors Zhang is recovering in hospital and is now out of danger.

Lucky: Doctors said the tongs only narrowly missed an artery in his neck which would likely have killed him
