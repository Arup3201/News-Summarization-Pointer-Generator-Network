Two prisoners who shared fantasies of killing someone disembowelled and attempted to behead a fellow inmate with a weapon made out of razor blades and plastic cutlery they'd been given by guards.

The body of convicted child rapist Mitchell Harrison, 23, was found with severe neck and eye injuries and a slashed open abdomen after fellow inmates Nathan Mann, 25, and Michael Parr, 34, attacked him at high-security HMP Frankland Prison in Durham.

Today, as the inquest into Harrison's death opened at Crook Coroner's Court in County Durham, a jury heard how the killers - who had intended to eat their victim's liver but decided not to at the last minute - had a cup of tea and a cigarette afterwards before asking a guard to open the cell door.

Durham Coroner Andrew Tweddle, warned the jury today that the details of the death would be ‘gruesome’, ‘graphic’ and ‘distressing’, but urged them to 'never lose sight of the fact that this was a real person and someone’s son.'

It emerged that the prisoners attacked Harrison, who was serving an indefinite sentence for raping a 13-year-old girl, with a home-made knife they'd made out of disposable razor blades and a plastic knife.

Robert Young, acting deputy governor at HMP Frankland, told the jury that at the time of the killing in October 2011, the number of disposable razor blades and plastic knives given to prisoners was not monitored.

He said: 'We issue them with toiletries and disposable razor blades.  At the time of Mr Harrison’s death there was no restriction to the number of disposable razor blades.

'We provide them with everyday items so they can live as normal life as possible, but because of the people we work with, an everyday item can become a lethal weapon.'

Mr Young said: 'If a prisoner said "I have snapped a fork" we would routinely issue them another one and then it would be down to the knowledge of staff.

'If it was on a repeated basis we would take note of that.'

Mitchell’s mother, father and step-father attended the inquest but showed little emotion as the disturbing details of their son’s death were recalled.

Giving evidence, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Chapman told the inquest how Mann and Parr planned to kill a fellow prisoner, apparently chosen at random.

He said: 'Some weeks previously they decided how they would like to kill somebody within the prison system - they had got themselves quite excited by that.

'He [Harrison] thought he was going down there [to Mann’s cell] to keep watch while Mann and Parr engaged in some sexual activity.

'He was immediately attacked by Mann on the bed and the door was shut by Parr.

'He asked for a pen from Parr and he put the pen into his left eye.

'He then looked to cut his head off. He certainly tried to do that by putting the knife into the neck on several occasions.

'Mann then cut down the middle of the stomach.

'There was some suggestion that they wanted to take his liver out and actually eat his liver.

'There had been a further suggestion to cut a T along the waistline.  They didn’t like what they saw and decided against that.

'They then decided to have a cup of tea and a cigarette prior to asking for the door to be opened.'

The killers then informed the senior officer on duty what they had done, and gave similar accounts of what happened in their subsequent interviews, the inquest heard.

It was said that Harrison, Parr and Mann were classed as ‘vulnerable’ prisoners because their crimes made them a target to others on the wing.

Mann was serving a sentence for the murder of two women in a Leicestershire nursing home and Parr had been convicted of attempted murder.

Speaking of the risk posed by Mann and Parr, Mr Young said: 'Neither were particularly high on the radar.

'Some of the information submitted through security information reports had indicated that both prisoners had issued some threats to both staff and other prisoners.

'In context we could have 50 to 60 at the time who had threatened to kill and, without minimising these threats, we try and take each one on an individual basis and take appropriate action.

'Many are just comments in the heat of the moment.'

The inquest is expected to conclude later this week.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
