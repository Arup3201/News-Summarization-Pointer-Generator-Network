Nigella Lawson has taken her two teenage children to view a house in central London in what seems to be further proof her marriage to Charles Saatchi may be over.

She was shown around the mews home - which is available to let for £11,000-a-month and worth £2.5million - by an estate agent on Friday, accompanied by her sister Horatia and children Cosima, 19, and Bruno, 17.

The television chef, 53, had already moved her family out of their £14million home in 
Chelsea after pictures showing her husband holding her by the throat 
were published.

Miss Lawson appeared pale and did not smile as the group viewed the property, the Sunday People reported.

Today a friend of the couple said the argument which triggered the assault was over whether her son Bruno should remain living at home.

Both the chef's children are from her first marriage to journalist John Diamond, who died of throat cancer in 2001.

The family friend told the Sunday Express that Mr Saatchi did not want the teenager staying at home any more as they did not get on.

'He says he feels 'crowded' - even though their house is huge,' the source told the newspaper.

'Nigella is naturally protective. She's not about to just see her son 
chucked out but whenever the subject is broached it always ends in an 
argument.

'The crux of the dispute between Charles
and Nigella has been over Bruno. Charles has never really got on with 
him and is now, in his bizarre macho way, flexing his muscles over his 
territory - he wants Bruno out. Nigella thinks he's being terribly unkind and mean.'

On
Friday, Miss Lawson tweeted a picture of a birthday cake made to 
celebrate Bruno's 17th birthday - the first tweet for the prolific user 
of the social networking site since the pictures of the attack were 
published on June 15.

The photograph received 358 favourites in the first hour, and has inspired dozens of supporters to reply with warm messages.

She
and her son have been staying in an apartment in Mayfair, while her 
daughter has been away on a gap year but returned to visit her mother.

It
is thought her son will accompany her on a trip to Los Angeles this

Last week, more of Miss Lawson's belongings were removed from her Chelsea home.

One of the vans contained a box which clearly had the words 'Bruno's room' written on it.

Two string instruments and a skateboard were loaded into van by a removal company.

Some of the chef's cooking equipment was also taken with a crepe maker being added to the pile of belongings.

When Nigella Lawson moved out, her husband Charles Saatchi had played down photographs of him grabbing her by the throat and tweaking her nose at a restaurant as a ‘playful tiff’.

But she appears to have dashed any hopes that the marriage of the couple - who have a £14million marital home in Chelsea, west London - can be reconciled.

For three days there has a van outside their home, sent
to take away not just her clothes but also her precious cookery 
utensils and recipe books – everything, it seems, but the kitchen sink.

Under the direction of Miss Lawson’s 
sister Horatia, removal men trooped in and out of the house removing box after 
box, including ones labelled ‘cookbooks’ and ‘kitchen’ as well as a food
processor, clothes and paintings.

Other items including Miss Lawson’s 
weights and exercise ball, dresses, hats, toys, toiletries and even a 
bag of wrapping paper were loaded into the van.

One box contained a can labelled 
Cannabis – which despite the alarming name is a legal energy drink 
containing hemp extract.

Miss Lawson was not seen at the move and Saatchi turned up 
only after the process was complete. There were so many possessions that
the removal team made two runs.

One onlooker said he had been told that some statues had been removed earlier in the day.

‘It
looked very much like Nigella is moving all of her personal possessions
out of the house – and isn’t going to be back in a hurry,’ he said.

Many
items were apparently taken to a storage facility while the rest were 
taken to an address some seven miles away in south-west London where 
Miss Lawson appears to be setting up home.

The
53-year-old has been seen several times looking drawn and without
her wedding ring, and while her two children and sister have visited, 
there has been no sign of her husband of ten years.

Saatchi, 70, has accepted a police caution for assault for the scenes that provoked their split, despite playing it down.

The
advertising tycoon turned modern art mogul was photographed grabbing 
Miss Lawson by the throat and tweaking her nose outside Scotts 
restaurant in central London during an extraordinary 27-minute incident.

When
Miss Lawson left home after the photos were published a week later, 
Saatchi claimed he had simply suggested she moved out to wait for ‘the 
dust to settle’.

He initially tried to explain the throat-grabbing as a ‘playful tiff’.

When further pictures of him twisting Miss Lawson’s nose emerged, he said he had merely been trying to clean her nose.

Miss Lawson’s spokesman last night continued to refuse to comment either on the assault incident or on the state of her marriage.

But moving her belongings to a different house would appear to signal the start of a divorce between the millionaire celebrity chef and Saatchi, who is said to have a fortune of up to £100million.
