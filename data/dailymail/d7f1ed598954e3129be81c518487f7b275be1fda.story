It's just not cricket without Richie Benaud behind the microphone and so the summer of Test matches in Australia will conclude at the SCG, without the legend calling a ball.

The veteran of the Channel Nine commentary team is unlikely to make his much anticipated return at his home-town Test beginning on Tuesday.

The Nine Network had left the door open for Benaud, 84, to return in the fourth and final match between Australia and India, ever since he appeared at their summer of cricket launch at the same ground a month ago.

However, Nine's head of sport Steve Crawley confirmed that Benaud hadn't been in touch about working at the Test and he accepted it wouldn't happen.

Benaud may be known as the voice of Australian cricket, but now he's using his marvellous tones to spruik lamb ahead of Australia Day.

He's taken on a role of alongside regular 'lambassador', AFL legend Sam Kekovich, in this year's Australia Day lamb campaign.

'To me, Australia Day is the perfect excuse to get together with friends and family over a BBQ and enjoy some delicious lamb chops,' the former Australian captain said. The ad campaign featuring two of the country's best loved sporting greats is about to be rolled out.

The 84-year-old has been absent from the Nine Network's cricket commentary team this summer while he battles skin cancer.

'He's a man of great manners and he knows that the offer is there and he would have made contact by now,' Crawley said.

He hasn't returned to the commentary box since a car crash left him with two crushed vertebrae 15 months ago and he revealed at Nine's cricket launch on December 6 that he was also undergoing treatment for cancer.

There had been speculation Benaud could even contribute to the commentary from his lounge-room in seaside suburb Coogee, but that too is unlikely.

'I very much doubt he'll be calling over the next five days,' Crawley said.

'But if he did decide to jump in a taxi and get over to the SCG, well, the door is always open to him.'

Crawley said only Benaud would decide if and when he got behind the microphone again.

'With Rich we just want him to get better,' Crawley said.

'All that matters is his health and recovery.'

Benaud has been heard in pre-recorded snippets this summer, including a brief tribute to the late Phillip Hughes during the 1st test in Adelaide and a small segment for the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne where he recounted his battle with illness and his gradual recovery at home
