FIFA has opened disciplinary proceedings against the Argentinian Football Association relating to a banner displayed by national-team players prior to last week's friendly against Slovenia.

Members of the Argentina team held a banner stating 'Las Malvinas son Argentinas', which translates as 'the Falkland Islands are Argentinian', before kick-off in La Plata.

A FIFA statement confirmed: 'The chairman of the FIFA disciplinary committee has decided to open disciplinary proceedings based on an apparent breach of art. 60 of the FIFA stadium and security regulations ('prevention of provocative and aggressive actions') and art. 52 of the FIFA disciplinary code ('team misconduct').'
