Chris Tarrant has told how he desperately tried to phone his girlfriend to say goodbye after suffering a stroke flying at 39,000ft.

The former Who Wants to be a Millionaire? host became convinced he was going to die after suddenly losing the use of his arms and legs on a flight from Thailand to London.

He said he battled the symptoms for 11 traumatic hours but didn't want to tell the cabin crew as he was afraid they would say there was nothing they could do.

TV presenter Chris Tarrant today told how he feared he would die on board a flight from Bangkok to Heathrow after suffering a stroke at 39,000ft

The 67-year-old host had flown to Thailand to film Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways (pictured). For 11 hours on board the flight he battled his symptoms, collapsing as he reached passport control at Heathrow

Andrew Marr unknowingly had two mini strokes before his third, near-fatal stroke last year, his wife has revealed.

Jackie Ashley said the BBC presenter, 54, was one of around 46,000 people a year who have a TIA, a transient ischaemic attack. In one instance he slurred his words, in the other he blacked out briefly.

He dismissed them as 'funny turns' but had he recognised the symptoms he might never have had the third stroke which left him with impaired mobility down his left side, said Miss Ashley, who is backing a Stroke Association campaign to raise awareness of TIAs.

Instead, he kept calling his long-term
 girlfriend Jane Bird, 51, to tell her he loved her. He said: 'I got 
very panicky. I was very alone up there, thinking, “I could die”.

'I
 wasn't sure if I was going to fade away completely on my own. I am 
incredibly lucky to be alive because one in three people who have 
strokes don't make it. It has made me appreciate my life so much more.'

Tarrant,
 67, had travelled to Thailand to film the second series of his Extreme 
Railways documentaries and said the symptoms started at the airport in 
Bangkok as he waited for his return flight on March 1.

'In
 the airport I started feeling this pain in my hand,' he said. 'I looked
 down and just slid off my seat. I was embarrassed more than anything. I
 thought it was cramp.

'But
 about an hour into the 12-hour flight I suddenly realised I couldn't 
lift my arm and my leg felt funny. I remembered the advert that helps 
you look out for the signs of a stroke. I tried three times to use the 
satellite phone on the plane to call Jane to tell her I wasn't well but 
it wouldn't work. I felt very alone. It was the longest flight of my 
life. I thought that could be it for me.

'I
 thought about telling the crew but they were Thai and didn't speak very
 good English. I thought, “What are they going to do? We're in mid-air”.
 It sounds daft but I guess I didn't want to find out the answer was 
there was nothing they could do.

Chris tried to call his girlfriend Jane Bird using the satellite phone, fearing he would not make it home alive

'The side of my body went numb. I became more and more frightened – then the realisation hit that it was a stroke.'

He
 said when the plane landed he tried to drag himself to passport control
 to ask for help but keeled over. A couple who had been on the same 
flight came to his rescue and called an ambulance.

He said he is keen to track them down to thank them, adding: 'What they did for me was amazing.'

He was taken to Charing Cross Hospital and had surgery to remove the blood clot causing a temporary loss of blood to his brain.

He
 spent two weeks in hospital but two months on, he has still not 
regained total control of his speech or movement. The father of six and 
grandfather of three was married twice before meeting his girlfriend, 
who is a legal assistant, in 2007.

He
 told the Sun on Sunday she has been his 'rock' and hinted they may now 
marry. He added: 'The stroke has been one hell of a warning.

'I
 have cut out the spirits and only drink wine in moderation now. Jane is
 helping me stay on the straight and narrow. The doctors told me I had 
been very lucky. There was a chance I was going to be wheelchair-bound.'

He
 said he now has a different outlook on life. 'I'm in no rush to get 
back into TV. Time is precious and spending time with family is more 
important than work.'

Stroke is a 'brain attack', according to the Stroke Association.

Its
 website says: 'For your brain to function, it needs a constant blood 
supply, which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. A 
stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and
 brain cells are damaged or die.

'About
 a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a
 month. But most stroke survivors will have long-term problems. It may 
take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery. 
Sadly, in the most severe cases, strokes can be fatal or cause long-term
 disability.'

It says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the FAST test:

1) Facial weakness - can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?2) Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms?3) Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?4) Time to call 999.

The Stroke Association says that failing any of these tests means it's a medical emergency and it's time to call 999.
