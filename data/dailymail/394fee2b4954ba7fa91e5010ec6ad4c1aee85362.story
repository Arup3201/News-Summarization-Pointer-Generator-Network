Defense lawyer Thomas Bergstrom referred to the judge's Tuesday's decision as 'an appropriate verdict,' the newspaper reported.

Authorities say the 54-year-old Garcia-Pellon stabbed her 55-year-old husband in bed at their Nether Providence home in February of last year.

According to The Delaware County Daily Times, Garcia-Pellon admitted to the crime, and using a kitchen knife as the murder weapon.

White was the starting center on the Penn team that made it to the Final Four in 1979. He was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers and played in Europe.

However, detectives said pornographic images were not recovered from the couple's computers, the website reported.
