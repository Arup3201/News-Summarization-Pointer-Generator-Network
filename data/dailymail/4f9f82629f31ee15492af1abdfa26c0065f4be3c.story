Novak Djokovic married his pregnant childhood sweetheart Jelena Ristic four days after winning his second Wimbledon title in a five-set thriller over Roger Federer.

The SW19 triumph may have got the 27-year-old out of the doghouse, too, after Djokovic postponed the wedding to concentrate on Wimbledon.

It all went according to plan, though, as the Serb saw off his Swiss counterpart and married Ristic, who is expecting their first child together.
