Former England captain Bryan Robson believes there is no outstanding candidate to replace Steve Gerrard as national skipper and that Roy Hodgson’s team are still miles away from  winning a major tournament.

Gerrard retired from international football this week after a disappointing World Cup, leaving Hodgson to choose a replacement.

Robson, who played 90 times for his country, spoke this week on Manchester United’s pre-season tour of America and admitted he is depressed by England’s immediate prospects.

He said: 'There is no stand-out captain. Even a few years ago, you had the likes of John Terry, Rio Ferdinand, Gerrard and Frank Lampard who could have been captain.

'There was a decision to be made over which one you would go with as captain because they were all strong candidates. But at this moment in time, I don’t think there is an outstanding candidate.

'Yes it does worry me a bit for England’s future. We haven’t got an outstanding candidate for captain and that is a worrying sign.'

Robson believes United striker Wayne Rooney is among the leading candidates for the job.

He added: 'You look at it and it is a 
difficult one. You want somebody who is a talker on the pitch, somebody 
who can organise and I think it is difficult for a forward to do that.

'But if you look at the England set-up at
 the moment, the candidates are probably Joe Hart, Gary Cahill, because 
he will be in the team, and Wayne Rooney.

Stepping up? Wayne Rooney is a leading candidate to take over from Steven Gerrard

'And the only one who really stands out is Wayne. There is no other real candidate when you look at it. If Wayne is not first choice in the England team, it will mean some of the young lads will have come through and done really well because, now that Gerrard has stepped down, Wayne is by far England’s best player.

'It doesn’t matter if you captain your club, it is about who is right for the job and who has the experience to be captain.

'If Wayne was to be selected as captain, it might give him a real boost where he really feels he needs to lead by example.s That may get the best out of Wayne, but that is the manager’s choice at the end of the day.'

Robson - speaking at an event in Los Angeles hosted by Bulova Manchester United's official timekeeper - watched England’s dismal World Cup summer with dismay.

He said: 'You need world class players to compete in major competitions and we haven’t got enough at this moment in the squad.

You would hope that some of the young lads come through and prove they are top quality players, the likes of Sturridge, Sterling, Barkley and Shaw.

'Now that they are coming into the squad, they are getting the chance, but we just have to wait for a year or two years.

'There are others, such as Chamberlain and Wilshere, who you have to give time to progress to become top-drawer players. Otherwise, if they prove that they are just good players, it will be a disappointment.

Because of the qualifying group we have for Euro 2016, I think we can go on and progress to the finals again, but as far as going on to win something like that, I still think we are way off.'
