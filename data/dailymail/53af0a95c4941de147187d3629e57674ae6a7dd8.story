Nico Rosberg is confident he will be stronger in 2015 after predicting he again faces 'an awesome challenge' from Lewis Hamilton for the Formula One world title.

Despite leading this year's championship for all but one grand prix up to the end of September, Rosberg was blown away by Hamilton over the final seven races as the Briton claimed 193 of a possible 200 points.

Although there has been debate of late regarding potential changes to the engine regulations for next season, the status quo now seems certain to remain.

It means there is likely to be another year of domination from Mercedes, and to that end another Hamilton versus Rosberg duel for the crown.

After a sometimes bitter campaign this season, Rosberg knows what he requires of himself for next year.

'I look forward to the battle again next year when I will try to be even stronger,' said Rosberg.

'It's going to be an awesome challenge. Lewis' level is extremely high, and this year Lewis was the best driver on the grid.

'But as we saw in the last race in Abu Dhabi when Williams were right there with us, the competition is strong, and other teams aren't going to be asleep either.

'It's impossible to say now, but we're confident we can keep it up for next season because we have a really strong team at the moment.

'Who knows how strong the opposition is going to be. We all need to wait and see.'

Rosberg gave credit to Hamilton, who won 11 races to the German's five. Despite the acrimony that surfaced between the pair in Monaco and Belgium, Rosberg feels he has learned his lessons.

As to whether he had any regrets, he replied: 'There are things I would do differently, yes of course, that's natural.

'It's often in a difficult experience you grow and learn the most, but regrets, no.

'It's not worth going into details now as to what he would do differently, but all in all it's really been a great year.

'Of course the end result didn't go the way I wanted, but with taking a step back, it's still been such an awesome experience.'
