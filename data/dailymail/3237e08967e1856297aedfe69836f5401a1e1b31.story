It wasn't University Challenge. And the quiz master was no Jeremy Paxman.

But the question still proved tricky enough for one Miss Philippines USA 2013 Beauty Pageant contestant, who fluffed her answer on camera and became the inadvertent star of a video that has gone viral on YouTube.

And the question in, er, question? 'Which is your favourite of the five senses?'

Joanlia Lising's nervous answer was: 
'Thank you for that wonderful question.

'If I have to pick out of the 
five senses, I would pick seeing, because seeing is the best sense that 
we can ever see, because seeing is believing, and believing into what 
you see is perfect... and... um... out of all those senses... seeing... 
would really be wonderful... thank you... that will be it.'

Her response was greeting by stifled laughter from the audience before Joanlia returned to the line-up, still smiling, and the two presenters looked utterly confused.

Mikey Gatal caught the incident on film and uploaded it to YouTube, where it immediately began trending. It has been watched over 90,000 times.

Derogatory comments have appeared beneath the video, such as this one from Java Jacks: 'The reason these womenï»¿ in beauty contests and Miss America have such bonehead responses to these simple questions is because it's impossible to think clearly when you've starved your body and mind for days.'

Joanlia did not win a prize in the contest, which finished on Sunday.

It gradually dawned on the presenters that Joanlia didn't know what she was talking about

Despite looking pleased with her answer, the presenters were confused by what Joanlia had said
