Pakistan plans to put former military dictator Pervez Musharraf on trial on charges of high treason, according to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.

Musharraf would face treason charges for his declaration of a state of emergency in 2007 and the suspension of constitutional rights that followed.

The call from Nawaz Sharif breaks with the country's tradition that military chiefs are untouchable, even after retirement.

Unprecedented: Prime Minister Sharif's (left) call for Pervez Musharraf (right) to be tried comes a month after the former military dictator returned to Pakistan from exile in Saudi Arabi and tried to contest elections

Sharif told parliament: 'Musharraf will have to answer for his guilt before the court'.

In Pakistan, the maximum penalty for treason is death. The move was likely to anger the country’s powerful armed forces.

Musharraf ousted Sharif in a coup 14 years ago, cutting short his second term as prime minister. Sharif was then hounded into exile in Saudi Arabia.

Sharif’s decision to move against Musharraf suggests he has decided to be more assertive than the last government towards the military, which has ruled for much of Pakistan’s 66-year history.

'Notwithstanding the fact that the prime minister has borne the brunt of Musharraf’s brazen coup, he wishes to assure both this august court and the people of Pakistan that he will act according to the highest standards of justice and follow the due process of law,' Sharif read from the statement.

Musharraf, a key ally of president George W. Bush in the early years of Washington’s 'war on terror', himself spent almost four years in self-imposed exile.

He returned to Pakistan hoping to contest elections in May, but was put under house arrest.

His detention appeared to break an unwritten rule that the top ranks of the military are untouchable, even after they have retired.

The current army chief has suggested the military is unhappy with Musharraf’s treatment.

Accusations that Musharraf failed to provide enough security to prevent the assassination of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 led to his house arrest.

He denies wrongdoing in all the cases brought against him.

Last month’s election brought Sharif back to office for an unprecedented third time and provided the first transition between two civilian governments in Pakistan’s turbulent history.
