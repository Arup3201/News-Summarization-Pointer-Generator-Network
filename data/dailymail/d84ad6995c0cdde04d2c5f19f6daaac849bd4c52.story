Allison Baden-Clay was murdered by her husband Gerard at their home in Brisbane, Australia

The great-grandson of Lord Baden-Powell, the founder of the world-wide Scout Movement, was yesterday sentenced to life in jail for murdering his former beauty queen wife.

Gerard Baden-Clay, 43, killed his wife Allison at their home in Brisbane, Australia, during an argument before dumping her body beside a river several miles away.

Mrs Baden-Clay’s family, who were seated in the crowded public gallery, cheered when the jury said they found her husband guilty at the end of the high-profile six-week trial.

He will serve 15 years in jail before he is eligible for parole.

The court had heard that Baden-Clay had multiple pressures weighing down on him on the night his wife disappeared in April 2012, among them the fact that he was having an affair and his Brisbane real estate business was in debt.

Crown Prosecutor Todd Fuller, QC, told the court that Baden-Clay had ‘efficiently and effectively’ killed his wife, probably by smothering her, as she fought for her life at their home.

During the struggle, he said Mrs Baden-Clay scratched her husband’s face as she tried to fight him off.

‘They are fingernail marks, they are on his face, they occurred after his children went to sleep and before his children got up,’ said the prosecutor.

‘There was a struggle between the two of them and she left her mark upon him.

Gerard Baden-Clay, pictured here giggling on camera and saying 'everything is going to be all right', has been jailed for life with a non-parole period of 15 years

‘They are damning and link to the act of violence without any doubt.’

After 
killing his wife, the court heard, Baden-Clay dragged her body across 
the back patio, where leaves unique to the property became entangled in 
her hair and clothing.

He
 then drove with the body to a bridge nearly eight miles away away and 
dragged his wife down an embankment where he left her. It was 11 days 
before her body was found.

Gerard Baden-Clay's mistress Toni McHugh tells of his promise to marry 
him

The preview of the full interview also includes a testimony from a witness who did not appear before the court claims Gerard called her looking for someone to kill his wife

During
 the trial it was heard that Baden-Clay had had a long-running affair as
 well as trysts with other women throughout his 14-year marriage.

He
 told his current lover, Toni McHugh, in an email that he loved her 
unconditionally and would be out of his marriage by the start of July  
2012.

In
 his defence, Baden-Clay insisted he did not kill his wife and said the 
scratch marks on his face were not from his wife’s fingernails but were 
the result of cutting himself while shaving.

Supporters of Allison placed yellow balloons outside the Brisbane Supreme Court. Yellow was her favourite colour

A
 profile about Mr Baden-Clay on a Brisbane real estate web page had 
stated before it was removed:

‘His personal philosophies of ethical 
excellence and team loyalty, derived from his lineage as the 
great-grandson of international Scouts founder Englishman Baden Powell, 
have clearly found their perfect landing spot in the field of real 
estate.’

Ms McHugh has given an interview which will screen on 60 minutes on Sunday night detailing her affair with Baden-Clay.

A spokeswoman for the family said the family were relieved but said of the result: 'This is not a win'

Allison's body was found dumped near a creek in Brisbane's west on April 30, 2012

'I believed I was in a loving, caring relationship that did have a future,' she told reported Tara Brown.

'He had told me that he would marry me one day.'

Ms McHugh said she loved the convicted murderer 'very much' and wanted to be Mrs Baden-Clay.

'I don't like to use that word "unconditional" anymore but I did love him unconditionally.

'And I was very forgiving, too forgiving.'

Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay took his wife's body and dumped it at a nearby creek, and then put in place, and persisted in, a deception plan

Justice John Byrne said Baden-Clay had shamelessly pretended to search for his wife, and had used a razor blade to disguise what were really the marks of Allison's finger nails on his face

Allison's parents read out emotional impact statements in court, reflecting on the difficult road ahead for their three granddaughters

Allison's close friend Kerry Anne Walker said the priority now was Allison's three daughters

The three-and-a-half year affair between Baden-Clay and Ms McHugh commenced in August 2008.

During
 the trial, the court heard evidence that Gerard Baden-Clay attended 
corporate functions and night time events connected with his real estate
 business in the company of mistress Toni McHugh rather than his wife 
Allison.

Ms McHugh also reveals the 'dark side of Baden-Clay' who
 is described as a man who 'lost all concept of right and wrong', and 
when pressed she admits she believes Baden-Clay did kill his wife.

The
 60 Minutes piece will also include testimony from a witness the jury 
never heard from, who claimed Baden-Clay called her and asked 'I'm 
looking for someone to kill my wife.'

Allison's supporters spoke outside court of their relief, but said the day was not a win and that their primary concern was for the welfare of the three Baden-Clay children

We finally have justice for Allison. The evidence presented at this trial has proven that Gerard Baden-Clay is responsible for the murder of his wife Allison. It has been a long wait over the last two years. And this result today marks the beginning of our long journey towards healing and finally allowing us to mourn and grieve this beautiful woman.

Today is not a win for our family, for it will not bring our beautiful Allison back. However it is the closure in another chapter of our journey for this family. We have lost Allison and nothing that has happened here today will bring her back. We as a family will grieve her tragic death forever. Her memory is tarnished by the fact that she was taken from us in such horrific circumstances.

We would like to sincerely thank the Queensland Police Service and the officers involved in the investigation, the SES volunteers who searched night and day in all weather, the scientific experts and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions who have all worked tirelessly to ensure that we have justice for Allison. We would also like to thank them for their compassion and support over what has been the darkest of days.

We have appreciated your efforts to protect the privacy of Allison's daughters. Our primary concern has always been and remains the physical and emotional wellbeing of Allison's three beautiful girls. We will help them to rebuild their lives and ask for your support, co-operation and privacy in order to do this. We have a long way to go to ensure that they will cope with a future without their mother.

Allison was a kind-hearted, generous woman, a loving wife and devoted mother whose legacy will continue if we all remember that life is precious, and to take the time to be kind, smile at those who pass you by and live for today. We, her family and friends, didn't get a chance to say goodbye but Allison will always remain forever in our hearts.

Thankyou.
