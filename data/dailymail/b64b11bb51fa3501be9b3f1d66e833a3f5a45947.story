A woman who described herself as a 'good girl' and had been married to the same man for 17 years has spoken about her 'year off' trying an open marriage.  

Writer Robin Rinaldi, now 50, slept with ten men and two women during her year of promiscuity in 2008, but  is now divorced from her husband.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, Robin opened up about her unorthodox decision, which she says was triggered by her husband's vasectomy.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning Robin Rinaldi, now 50, opened up about her unorthodox lifestyle

Robin was content in marriage for years - but she wanted kids and he didn't she decided to try an open marriage'

The arrangement which she described as '5:2 marriage' involved spending weekdays sleeping with strangers and weekends with her husband. 

'I would say before the year I was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied, normal loving relationship,' she said of her 17 year marriage to Scott Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker.

'But when I got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and I knew the discussion of having a baby was over, which kick-started this experience,' she explained.

'I looked forward to my death bed and thought. "What will I have?" I won’t have children and grandchildren. Will I at least have lived fully?"'

'If I couldn’t have one I wanted the other,' she explained.

'Like a lot of women at that age I was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that I wasn’t going to have children. It was the perfect storm.

Robino said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city'

'WIld oats': Robin, 50, negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years, which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship

'I have had lots of people telling me I should have travelled the world, tried painting classes or cooking – but I already know how to cook!'

She also said having 'very little sexual variety' in her youth was a motivating factor, as the fact that she was living in San Francisco, which she described as 'a very liberal city'.

'I was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation, ' she said.

'So I thought OK whilst we do that I need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same.'

Under the terms of her new deal, Rinaldi took out an apartment, where she lived from Monday to Friday and would bed her conquests.

But over the weekend she would go back to Mansfield, and the two would live as a married couple, without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart. 

'The ground rules were safe sex, not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances,' she explained. 'But at the end of the year, we each broke two rules.'

To find willing participants in her project Robin decided not to pick up men at bars, but to be more strategic in her search.

'I was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had I picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand,' she explains.

'So I felt like going about it in a more clear-headed, conscious way.'

Robin posted an online ad, entitled Good Girl Seeks Experience. In the post, she wrote: 'I'm a 44-year-old professional, educated, attractive woman in an open marriage, seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality.'

'I said I wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks. I explained that if it led to sex then great, but that I couldn’t get seriously involved or see them more than a few times.'

The next day, Robin had 23 offers and over the course of the year had 12 sexual partners, including two women. 

Struggle: Robin said her husband, Scott Mansfield, right, was loving and dependable - but did not share her desire to have children, driving her to want lovers instead

So would she advise it? ‘Not if you want to stay married,' she told This Morning hosts Philip Schofield and Amanda Holden. 'Read my book instead and have an armchair adventure.' 

'I was well aware it would be very risky – but I didn’t think we had that much to lose.

'This 5:2 idea of weekends together and weekdays apart was to put a bit of distance between us to see each other in a new light and add some sparkle.

'That happened at first,' she said, but admitted their sexual exploits ended up pushing them apart.

Account: Rinaldi describes every step of the 'project' in intimate detail in her newly-released book, The Wild Oats Project

'It was hard to put it all back in the box,' she exlained.

Robin, who made the life-changing decision to pursue sex with other people in 2008, has written a book about her exploits called The Wild Oats Project.

In the book she describes her relationship with Mansfield, a brewer and wine-maker, as 'stuck in a rut', adding that 'our once-a-week sex life was loving, but lacked spontaneity and passion'.

Recounting her exploits in her book, Robin described her first encounter with a 40-year-old lawyer, whom she bedded in her apartment on the second date: 'We stumbled to the bed, where he turned me onto my hands and knees and took me from behind.

'We had intercourse twice and, after he left, I felt satiated.'

She later moved on to much younger men, and described texting her husband goodnight from a Las Vegas hotel room moments after a 23-year-old paramour left the room.

Two of her 12 encounters were with women, one of which was a threesome. 

Describing another encounter, she writes explicitly about taking a new-found pleasure in fellatio. 

However, after the raucous year, Rinaldi admitted, she could not turn back.

Attempts to rekindle their marriage after the year failed - and Rinaldi began sleeping with one of the men from the past year, whom she refers to by a pseudonym.

She wrote: 'The turning point was hearing from Alden. He sent me an e-mail, out of the blue, several months after the project had come to an end.

'Before long, we were having sex again. Being with him was exquisite. After reconnecting with Alden and falling deeply in love with him, there was no going back.'

Irretrievable: After Rinaldi's year of uninhibited encounters, she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with Mansfield, and the two now have different partners

Rinaldi has now lived with 'Alden' for five years in a monogamous relationship, while Mansfield has also moved on.

The former couple now consider themselves at peace - and Mansfield was even happy with her writing the book, detailing every aspect of their sex lives and her previously secret exploits with other men.

Speaking to the Daily Beast about how he responded to the book, she said: 'His response was, "You have to write it. If you write it well, it won’t really be about us, it will be about lots of marriages."'
