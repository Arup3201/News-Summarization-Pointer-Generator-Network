The FA want Wigan owner Dave Whelan to name the two influential people at the top of their organisation who told him ‘nothing would come’ from the ongoing investigation of new club manager Malky Mackay.

Whelan made the claim in between crass and offensive remarks about Jews and Chinese people while defending his decision to appoint Mackay. The FA are already investigating Mackay, who is accused of sending racist, sexist and homophobic texts.

There is considerable annoyance at Wembley about Whelan’s alleged knowledge about the outcome of that inquiry, especially as none of the executive team, nor FA board members, is said to have spoken with Wigan’s owner.

Several senior FA officials, including Heather Rabbatts, the independent director and FA inclusion board chair, have been pushing for Mackay to be charged.

Jonathan Hall, the FA’s director of football services, is leading the Mackay investigation, which has been complicated by the issue of whether the texts were private or not.

There is no question Whelan’s comments are public but Mackay’s remarks emerged from a private text exchange with his Cardiff director of football Iain Moody, as were Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore‘s sexist exchanges with PL lawyer Nick West. And Scudamore escaped FA censure.

Neither Wigan nor Whelan would comment about the ‘FA assurances’ but club insiders say 77-year-old Whelan is prone to forgetfulness. He has until Wednesday to respond to a ‘very concerned’ FA.

Premier League official Michael Oliver  has quit as head of Northumberland’s referee academy in protest at the county FA taking no action against vice-president John Cummings. 

Cummings was banned for four months by the FA for his comment that a ‘woman’s place is in the kitchen and all the time I’m alive a woman will never referee in my league’. 

Four other county officials have also stepped down after the secret ballot verdict that no further local disciplinary measures needed to be taken against Cummings. 

He made his remarks to referee development officer Lucy May, Oliver’s partner.

Such was the surprise at world dressage champion Charlotte Dujardin being voted Sky Sports/Sunday Times sportswoman of the year that some believed there had been a mix-up during the awards ceremony.

Many assumed Jo Pavey, who won the European 10,000 metres at the age of 41, would finish first rather than third. If not, then runner-up Lizzy Yarnold, the Olympic skeleton champion, rather than Dujardin, whose sport receives little attention outside the Olympics.

There was no mistake. Dujardin won the panel vote easily with Sky chief Barney Francis pushing her case. Pavey was  named British Athletics Writers’ female athlete of the year on Friday.

Former sports journalist Brian Doogan, the most unlikely hack ever to cross the Rubicon into public relations when close friend Martin O’Neill took him to Aston Villa, will cause surprise again with Everton making him their new head of media.

The difficulty England Rugby 2015 faces trying to shift tickets for eight World Cup matches at the Millennium Stadium is highlighted by the option to buy as many as 15 when online sales resume on Monday. 

Tickets are still available for five games in Cardiff, including Wales’s group matches against Fiji and Uruguay. Worryingly for ER2015 and Welsh rugby, there were 17,000 empty seats for their autumn international against Australia.

Leicester also has 15-tickets-per-customer availability for all three of their group games. 

They might have sold better if the matches were at Leicester Tigers’ Welford Road rather than Leicester City’s King Power Stadium, which has better facilities.

Even Manchester United, with their global fan base, now have to advertise ticket availability. 

TalkSPORT were used to publicise unsold corporate packages for the Liverpool game on December 14 with the hospitality at Lancashire cricket’s Old Trafford ground.
