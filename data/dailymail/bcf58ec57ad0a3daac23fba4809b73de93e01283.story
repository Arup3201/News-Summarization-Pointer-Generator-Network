A policeman who made national headlines when he organised and starred in a spoof video of YouTube hit Gangnam Style for charity has been sacked for gross misconduct.

Sergeant Gary Watts, who served with Devon and Cornwall Police, was dismissed following a disciplinary hearing on Monday.

On Twitter - of which he is a prolific user - he said of the decision last night: ‘It's complete b******s.’

His account @surfchilled is now unavailable.

Devon and Cornwall Police said in a statement: ‘The allegations were found to be proven and Sgt Watts has been dismissed from the force with immediate effect for gross misconduct. No criminal charges have been brought against him.’

The force did not disclose the nature of the allegations but a spokesman told MailOnline that 'it has nothing whatsoever to do with the charity video or social media'.

Deputy chief constable Bill Skelly added: ‘We expect high standards from our officers and any officer who is thought to have breached these standards can be subject to disciplinary inquiries which can ultimately lead to dismissal.

‘It is important that members of the public have confidence in the officers and staff who serve their communities and behaviour standards are extremely important in maintaining that confidence.’

Mr Watts, who was based in Falmouth, raised thousands of pounds to help a disabled boy by recreating with colleagues the popular music video by Korean rapper Psy.

The video became a huge hit on YouTube with more than 100,000 views.

He was the force's most prolific user of Twitter, with thousands of followers, and had been praised for promoting a positive image of the police.
