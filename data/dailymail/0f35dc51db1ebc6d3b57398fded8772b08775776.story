Prosecutors made a 'comical series of errors' in a bid to extradite a Mafia fugitive found hiding in a west London suburb, a court heard today. 

Domenico Rancadore, known as The Professor, is battling Italian authorities as they try to extradite him to Italy to serve a seven-year sentence for his association with the Mafia.

He spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner with his family in Uxbridge, west London, before he was first arrested in August last year.

Domenico Rancadore arrives at Westminster Magistrates' Court today where he is fighting extradition to Italy for his Mafia associations. He spent two decades living under the name of Marc Skinner  in west London

He has previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' and had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years, who accused him of fleeing Italy, where he faced trial over his alleged Cosa Nostra 'man of honour' connections.

A first extradition hearing in March failed when Senior District Judge Howard Riddle changed his original decision to extradite him, over concerns that Italian prison conditions would breach his human rights because he has a serious heart condition.

But a new arrest warrant issued in April by Italian authorities addressed those issues, prosecutors said at the time.

Rancadore's lawyers said that bringing the same case against him twice was an abuse of process.

Representing Rancadore, Alun Jones QC also described his client's second arrest, which took place at 9pm on a Friday night, as 'utterly, utterly unnecessary'. 

John Hardy QC, representing the Italian authorities, told the court that the CPS had made a 'comical series of blunders' in relation to the Sicilian's extradition but argued that they do not amount to an abuse of process and should not stop the extradition going ahead.

The mistakes included serving legal papers late to Rancadore's lawyers ahead of an appeal at the High Court and failing to inform counsel that a new assurance had been given by the Italian authorities regarding the prison he would be sent to if extradited.

'It is unfortunate that due to human error the process has not flowed as smoothly as it should have, but we say that to say that there has been an abuse of process is a quantum leap too far,' Mr Hardy said.

He had previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy' and had evaded Italian authorities for 20 years

Appearing before at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, said his health was in decline

Appearing before at Westminster Magistrates' Court in central London, his wife Anne Skinner, known to the court as Mrs Rancadore, said his health was in decline. 

She said: 'It has deteriorated, he trembles a lot and he suffers now from claustrophobia.

'He cannot be inside a lot and has to go out in the garden because he needs open air spaces.

'He is generally very confused in his mind and it is causing stress with everybody in our house, myself and my daughter as well.

'He's mumbling and he accuses me of talking to somebody on the phone when I'm not.

Rancadore has previously been described as 'one of the heads of one of the most powerful mafia associations in Italy'

'One time in the middle of the night he woke me up and asked me who I was talking to.

'He has discussed this with the doctor because his mental state is quite worrying for all of us.

'He often seems quite confused and sits quietly with his hands on his head looking into space.'

Mrs Rancadore said the family had been 'shocked' by her husband's second arrest, which she said took place in front of an 11-year-old relative.

She also said her husband is 'concerned' about what would happen to his family if he were to be sent back to Italy.

'It is not only his health, he is worried about the family because he would be in Italy and we would be here and that has a great influence on his mental state,' she said. 

Judge Riddle told Rancadore that he was bailing him to appear for another short hearing on October 21, when the court is expected to hear from an expert for the defence on prison conditions in Italy.

He said: 'As you know, I have heard legal argument here today and now I have to see if the argument on prison conditions needs time for litigation.

'A report is being prepared on your behalf and should be ready round about October 10.

'I am going to give everyone time to consider it and bail you to return here on October 21 at 10am just for a short hearing to see how far we need to go.'
