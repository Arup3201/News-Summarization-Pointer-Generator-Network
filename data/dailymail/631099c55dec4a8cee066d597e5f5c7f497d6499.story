The body of a missing three-year-old boy was found  inside his Florida family home where he lived with his father, step mother and two siblings.

Ahizya Osceola's body was discovered in an 'obscure location' inside the home late Thursday night, according to Hollywood Police Chief Frank Fernandez. 

Authorities had been searching for the boy since he was reported missing on Thursday at approximately 11.48am.

The search ended tragically Thursday night about 12 hours later when the body was discovered, and police announced on Friday around 5.40am, that the public's help was no longer needed.

Chief Fernandez would not give further details on whether the child's body had possibly been hidden in this 'obscure location' or if he died accidentally while hiding there, according to the Sun-Sentinel.

However, he said on Friday morning during a press conference that a criminal investigation was ongoing. 

It was also announced that the young child's body was being processed by Broward Medical Examiner's Office.

Once his Ahizya's is released, he will be buried at the Big Cypress Seminole Indian reservation - the child's parents, Nelson Osceola and Karen Cypress are members of the Seminole Tribe of Florida.

Nelson, 24, told authorities he had last seen his son at 4am on Thursday when he went to check on his eight-month-old daughter at the home located on Johnson Street.

He  said his wife, who has not been identified, was awake and the boy was still sleeping when he left home at 7.30am.

He was in contact with his wife for a couple of more hours that morning before she fell back asleep with the baby, and woke up realizing he had disappeared. She told Osceola that Ahizya was missing through a text message. 

Karen made an emotional plea to the public on Thursday after her son was reported missing.

The search ended tragically on Friday around 5.40am, and police said the child's parents have been cooperating with the investigation (above scenes from the home on Friday morning)

She said the child was her 'heart' and 'life' and that she 'just wanted him home'.

Police said they had a two to three square-mile area where they went door-to-door and to each house, exhausting every effort possible, while also having volunteers come together to pray for the safe recovery of Ahizya.

Dogs were also sent out tracking the scent of the child during the search.

Police said the child's parents have been cooperating with the investigation, and it was not revealed whether there were suspects or if charges had been filed in relation to the incident.
