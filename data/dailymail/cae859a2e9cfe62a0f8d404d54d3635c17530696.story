Connor Marshall has died after being found in a life-threatening condition outside a caravan at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, on Sunday morning

Police have launched a murder investigation after a teenager died in hospital after being seriously assaulted at a Welsh caravan park.

Connor Marshall, 18, from Barry in south Wales, was found in a life-threatening condition at Trecco Bay Caravan Park, Porthcawl, in the early hours of Sunday.

He was taken to the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff and remained in intensive care for almost a week - but despite the best efforts of doctors he died today.

South Wales Police say they have now launched a murder inquiry.

The teenager and two friends went to a number of pubs in the Porthcawl area before they returned to the park at 1am.

Connor was found seven hours later by early morning campers.

Police made a caravan to caravan search at the park - one of the biggest in the UK and a favourite for families.

Holidaymaker father-of-three Martin Hatley, from Swindon, said: 'I was shocked. As a dad to a teenage boy myself it's terrible to hear about something like this.

Detective Superintendent Paul Hurley said: 'Officers are continuing to conduct inquiries to establish the full circumstances of what happened. 

'However, we would appeal to anyone who has any information that could assist us with our inquiries to contact us immediately.

'This was a brutal attack upon Connor with fatal consequences.

'I believe the person responsible may have shared information with friends, relatives or neighbours and I would urge anyone who has information or who may have been in the area of Trecco Bay between midnight and 7am on March 8 to contact the police.

'I would like to reassure residents and visitors to Porthcawl and Trecco Bay caravan park that this appears to be an isolated incident on a well-managed site. 

'Parkdean Trecco Bay Management are continuing to work closely with South Wales Police.

'Our thoughts are with Connor's family and all those affected by this tragic incident.'

Earlier in the week, forensic specialists were seen searching for clues in the Sycamore Drive and Cedars area of Trecco Bay - one of the UK's biggest caravan parks. 

A caravan park spokesman said their thoughts were with Connor's family and that they are doing all they can to help the police with their investigation.

Anyone able to help police with their inquiries should contact 01656 655555, 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111, quoting the reference number 1500080214.
