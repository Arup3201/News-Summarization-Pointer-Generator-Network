Ever wondered what it would be like to run like a dog with the wind gushing against your fur as you rush past obstacles on the beach before diving into the Sicilian sea?

Well one video certainly gives an insight into the excitement of being let off the lead, showing an Italian dog sprinting to the beach has been uploaded to YouTube.

Walter, a golden labrador, knows the best route from his home down to the beach and takes the viewer along for the exciting ride before he plunges into the sea.

The footage was captured on Monday at Walter’s owner’s house in Sicily using a GoPro camera which was attached to the dog’s back.

During the 40-second video Walter can be seen leaving his owner's home, sprinting down steps, running past hedges and trees and squeezing past sunbathers and rocks on the beach. 

GoPro has recently released its first ever mount for pets, the Fetch mount. The company says the special cameras are the 'perfect device to document life from a dog's point of view.'
