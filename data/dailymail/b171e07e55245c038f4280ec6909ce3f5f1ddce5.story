A baby wombat has made a full recovery after being found in the pouch of her dead mother's body.

After noticing the animal at the side of the road, passerby decided to check if the creature was carrying any offspring.

Incredibly, despite its mother being struck by a car, the teeny critter was found shivering inside its pouch, still suckling at its mother teat.

Recovery: Leah the wombat survived the death of her mother and is now making good progress at the home of Kim Hunter in Kinglake, Victoria

After an urgent phone call from a passerby to the local wildlife helpline, voluntary animal carer and ranger, Kim Hunter, 48, came to the rescue of the baby wombat and took it her home in Kinglake, Victoria.Â 

Despite being merely hours away from death, Kim has managed to nurse the wombat named Leah, back to health with round-the-clock care.

By bottle feeding the adorable wombat every four hours, the five-week-old is now on the road to recovery.

Tiny: Leah was hours from death when she was found but, with round-the-clock care survived

Fully grown: Leah will eventually develop a thick coat of fur

Kim said 'Leah was cold to the touch and weighed only 300 grams when she arrived, she now weighs 650 grams.

'She's very lucky, although she was uninjured she was cold to the touch and I'd say she was only a few hours away from dying.

'Wombats often graze at the side of the road and are sometimes hit by oncoming cars, her mother must have shielded her against the blow.

'Leah is too young to grow her own fur yet so I keep her on a heated mat, I have to bottle feed her every four hours, even throughout the night.

'But it's definitely been worth it, we've built a strong bond over the weeks, she knows I'm her mum now.

'The online response to Leah is unbelievable, people have really fallen in love with Leah.'
