Andy Murray was caught up in a dramatic security scare after two autograph hunters brandished tennis racquets at him and an eyewitness thought they had a shotgun and called police.

The Wimbledon champion was being driven through London when he was approached by Ifran Ahmed – the same man who accidentally hit him in the eye with a brochure as he left upmarket Nobu restaurant in July.

Ahmed, who once set up a business selling celebrity memorabilia on eBay, is said to have pursued the star from the Piccadilly branch of Waterstones after a book signing on Wednesday evening. Murray, 26, was on his way to film his appearance on the Jonathan Ross Show, which airs tonight.

Ahmed was joined by fellow autograph hunter Ashley Philpott as they drove behind Murray in a Mercedes. When Murray’s car pulled up at traffic lights, they bolted out of their car, holding up tennis racquets for him to sign.

However, a member of the public who believed they were holding a shotgun called police. Officers caught up with the men in South London and arrested them, along with two other men.Murray is said to have been unaware that the police were involved until yesterday.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: ‘Police were called at 5pm on Wednesday, November 6, by a member of the public reporting they had seen a male in a Mercedes car in possession of a firearm.

‘The car was stopped and four men – aged 27, 21, 31 and 26 – were arrested on suspicion of being in possession of a firearm. They were taken into custody and on November 7 bailed to return on a date in late January, pending further investigation. A search of the car was conducted and no trace of a firearm was found.’

Ahmed set up an eBay account selling celebrity memoribilia in 2002 but it’s understood he no longer runs it. When previously asked on Twitter how he got so many autographs, he said: ‘We have our ways. We know how to get to the very front of the queue. I’m a professional.’
