Paris Saint-Germain were made to pay the price for a raft of missed chances by Edinson Cavani when Monaco scored an equaliser deep into stoppage time.

Lucas Moura looked to have saved the blushes of his misfiring team-mate when he sent PSG ahead.

But substitute Anthony Martial took advantage of some shocking defending by David Luiz and Co. in PSG's defence to level the score.

On this display it was hard to see why Manchester City have bid for Cavani in recent years and why Arsenal and Chelsea have both shown interest in him.

The Uruguayan striker has been criticised in France for failing to live up to his £55million price tag when he moved from Napoli last year.

In the absence of Zlatan Ibrahimovic, out with a heel injury, the 27-year-old has been handed the chance to drive the team forward.

But on a night when virtually everything he tried went wrong, PSG had to rely on the sprightly Moura to finally find the net.

It began going wrong in the first half.

On 38 minutes, he rose highest at the near post in an attempt to reach Maxwell's cross from the left only to flick the ball, taking it off the head of Blaise Matuidi who would surely have opened the scoring.

Instead it was the away side who had came closest to breaking the deadlock in the opening 45 minutes.

The home side were left frustrated as they struggled to find a way past Ligue 1 rivals Monaco

Monaco's chance came a minute before the break, Joao Moutinho passing into Layvin Kurzawa who sent a first-time shot crashing off the crossbar.

And Cavani's night got no easier early in the second half.

He did well on 57 minutes to turn one way and the next before laying the ball off to substitute Jean-Christophe Bahebeck, who forced Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic into a smart save at his near post.

But two minutes later he swung wildly at the ball on the edge of the box, completely mistiming his shot, and the ball bobbled before being cleared high into the air.

As Cavani looked up, it was hard to tell if he was following the flight of the ball or pleading to the football gods for mercy.

If it was the latter, they failed to listen as a minute later he was played in by Thiago Motta, burst through on goal then fell over.

PSG were fortunate the score remained goalless just after the hour when the ball dropped to Kurzawa and he had just defender Gregory van der Wiel to beat but struck a weak shot so that the PSG man could fling a leg at the ball to divert it wide.

Finally, the home side found a player who could stick the ball in the net, when the whippet-like Moura stole in a the back post to put PSG ahead in the 71st minute.

That seemed like it would be enough for all three points, until PSG failed to clear in second-half stoppage time and Martial took a touch before finishing with a low strike. 

Laurent Blanc thought his side were feeling the effects of their impressive 3-2 win against Barcelona on Tuesday.

'They were very tired after the Barcelona game. We have done a marathon, this was our seventh game in 23 days. It’s not illogical that the lads were at the end of the road.

'I am not worried. Marseille are top and deserve it. But they don’t play in Europe, don’t forget.'

Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim, on the other hand, thought his side were unlucky not to grab all three points. 

'It was an even game but Monaco had the better situations. We could have done better than a draw.'
