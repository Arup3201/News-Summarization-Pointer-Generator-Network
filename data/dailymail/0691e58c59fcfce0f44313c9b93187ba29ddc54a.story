Terror: Victoria Ratheram in the nursery of her house, where she was threatened by robbers in Woolerton, near Market Drayton, Shropshire

A heavily pregnant mother has told how she was tied up at knifepoint in front of her three-year-old son by a machete-wielding gang who ransacked her rural home.

Victoria Ratheram was alone in her detached home with her son when the raiders, also armed with a truncheon, burst in.

One of the robbers held the machete to her face, telling her: ‘Don’t scream.’

Mrs Ratheram, who is eight months pregnant, told the Daily Mail yesterday: ‘My son Oliver was right next to me, playing with his toy car. I just told him, “Do as mummy says, everything is fine”.

‘I knew I had to stay calm for him, but underneath I was absolutely terrified.’

The 28-year-old mother was then tied to a chair in the nursery which she and her husband James had prepared for the new baby.

The robbers even frisked her around her pregnant stomach to see if she was hiding a phone they could steal.

‘I was absolutely terrified,’ Mrs Ratheram said. ‘All I could think about was my son and my unborn baby. I thought, “Let them do what they want, nothing in the house matters. Just please don’t let them hurt my son, please don’t let them hurt my baby”.’

The gang also targeted the couple’s neighbours during the raid, leaving a getaway car on the outskirts of the tiny village.

They burst into the Ratherhams’ home in Wollerton, Shropshire, at 9.30am last Thursday. ‘I was in my home with Oliver and my husband had gone to work,’ said Mrs Ratheram, a full time mother.

‘Suddenly my dogs started barking and I saw the front door was open. The next minute I saw three men, one with his face covered, one with a machete and one with what looked like an old-fashioned wooden police truncheon.

‘The guy with the machete held it to my face, and said, “Don’t scream, and we won’t hurt you”. They also threatened to hurt my dog. They kept asking, “Where’s your safe, where’s your safe?” I told them we didn’t have one and they said, “If we find out you’re lying, there will be trouble”.’

As one raider ransacked the house, another tied Mrs Ratheram’s hands and feet. He then forced her at knifepoint on to a chair in the nursery.

The man with the machete then patted around her stomach to see if she was hiding a phone or any other valuable. ‘That made me feel physically sick,’ said Mrs Ratheram. ‘It was horrible.’

The robbers drew the curtains and left her in the nursery, telling her not to shout or scream or they ‘would be back’. ‘At that point, I didn’t know if they were planning to come back or whether they were going to hurt us or what,’ she said.

‘The man with the machete had said he was going to wait for us so I was too scared to shout or scream. I just wanted to hold my son but my hands were tied. He was climbing on the new baby’s cot and I just thought, if he falls, I can’t catch him. It was horrendous.’

Once the gang had left, Mrs Ratheram’s alsatian Bella tried to gnaw through the ties on her feet to let her free. ‘She must have sensed I was in danger, because she never left my side,’ said Mrs Ratheram.

‘She even tried to lunge at the robbers at one point. I was terrified they’d hurt her in front of my son because he loves her so much.’

Mrs Ratheram and her son were found ten minutes later by a neighbour’s daughter, who went to check on them after seeing the door open.

She cut Mrs Ratheram free with kitchen scissors before going to check on the couple’s next door neighbours, who had also been targeted by the raiders.

‘I was only tied up there about ten minutes, but it felt like a lot longer,’ Mrs Ratheram said. ‘As soon as my hands were free I picked up my son. I can hardly describe the relief that we were all right.

‘The first thing I thought was that I just had to get out of the house there and then. I just picked Oliver up and I ran. As soon as I stepped outside, I saw the police and I just thought, “Thank God”.’ Astonishingly, the raiders took nothing other than the couple’s several mobile phones. They even left her handbag, which was in the kitchen with her purse inside.

Mrs Ratheram said her son had not been too traumatised. ‘One of the raiders told him it was a game, which is one thing I am grateful for,’ she said. ‘He hasn’t mentioned it and I don’t think he really understood what happened at all.’ But she said that she herself had been left ‘completely traumatised’. ‘I’m not in a good way,’ she said. ‘I’m jumpy and I get really anxious. I’m not sleeping at all.

‘My dad’s upped the security on my house, but it still frightens the living daylights out of me when people ring the doorbell. I feel physically sick at about 9.30 in the mornings, for about that period of time when they came and did it.

‘I get my dog to sleep next to the door, my gates have been padlocked and I won’t let my husband go to work because I’m scared to be in the house on my own for the whole day.’

Mrs Ratheram, who worked at a stables before becoming a full-time mother, and her 32-year-old husband, an online marketing manager, have lived in the village all their lives and married four years ago.

They went for a check-up on their unborn baby on Saturday, and were relieved to find that all was well. The expectant mother vowed she would not to be forced out of the £200,000 cottage where she and her husband keep horses, rabbits, dogs and cats.

Shattering the peace: The burglars said they would hurt Mrs Ratheram and her pet dogs if she did not do as they told her

‘I don’t feel safe in my own home now, but I will not let these men make me leave my house,’ she said. ‘I have no intention of letting these people make me move. It is my home, not theirs.’

Mr Ratheram said: ‘Victoria was really brave. I have no idea how she kept so calm but I know she will have been just thinking about our son. I’m really proud of her.

‘It’s been a horrible experience for her. It’s a really quiet village and we never thought anything like that would happen.’

The Ratherams were the first of two families targeted by the robbers in two separate raids in broad daylight on Thursday.

In the second raid, a woman and her teenage son were attacked, leaving the teenager with a cut to his hand which needed an operation.

The burglars are understood to have taken laptops and mobile phones from the second property, as well as a black Land Rover Discovery, which they abandoned on the outskirts of the village for another vehicle.

The raids have stunned villagers. Paul Morris, 49, a childcare support manager, who saw Mrs Ratheram outside her home, said: ‘She was shaking and crying. She must have been absolutely terrified.’

Police want to trace a silver saloon car seen in the village from about 6am on the day of the attack which they think the gang may have used after dumping the Discovery.
