What started out as a birthday celebration Friday night ended in a tragedy when a car heading down a dark, dead-end street in a desolate industrial area of Queens, New York, flipped over a wooden curb into a creek, killing four passengers.

The driver was somehow able to escape the sinking vehicle and told officers at the scene in the Astoria section of Queens that his four friends were trapped in the submerged car.

Police said the 2009 Honda Accord tumbled into Steinway Creek, a trash-strewn inlet off the East River, just after 10.30pm Friday.

Victims: Jada Monique Butts, 19 (left), and Darius Fletcher (21), died in the crash along with their 2 other friends

Lone survivor: Andrew Gramm, 20, was the driver of the submerged car who was able to somehow escape to safety and call for help

Deadly outcome: Police investigate the scene of an accident on a dead-end street where a car containing five people plunged into Steinway Creek in the Astoria neighborhood of Queens

Fire department divers pulled the four victims from the car. Police identified them as 21-year-old Darius Fletcher, 19-year-old Jada Monique Butts, 19-year-old Crystal Gravely and 20-year-old Jaleel Furtado. They were pronounced dead at area hospitals.

Several of the victims' family members visited the scene Saturday morning. Jaleel Furtado's sobbing stepmother, Michelle, was comforted by police.

The 20-year-old driver, Andrew Gramm, was listed in stable condition at Elmhurst General Hospital. A blood test showed that he had no alcohol in his system by the time he emerged from the creek and went for help. 

Police towed the mangled silver Honda from the creek this morning and deposited it on the pavement upside-down, just a few feet from the water's edge. They then flipped it back on its wheels and carted it away on a flatbed truck.

NYPD divers helping with the towing operation were hosed off by firefighters when they emerged from the creek, a foul-looking inlet named after the nearby Steinway piano factory choked with trash and mud.

Police visited a car service business that has security cameras trained in the direction the car would have been going in hopes of learning the vehicle's speed in the seconds before it crashed.

The deaths shook residents of East Elmhurst, the neighborhood of brick row houses where all four victims lived.

Hairdresser Sheila Ortiz said both of the young women who died got their hair done at her salon, and she had known them since they were little girls.

‘Those kids were very happy,’ Ortiz said. ‘They were nice young kids, not troublemakers.’

According
 to his Facebook page, Furtado, known to his friends as 'Leel,' attended Saint Peter's College and was part of a local hip hop 
collective called Hurst Nation.

Gravely
 studied at LaGuardia Community College and worked at a beauty salon in 
Elmhurst, while her friend Monique Butts attended Borough of Manhattan 
Community College.

Fletcher was expected to graduate this year from William Paterson University with a degree in communications. He is survived by his parents and three siblings.

Fletcher’s mother told the New York Daily News that she spoke with her son just before he headed out to go to the birthday celebration with his friends.

‘I always said to him, “Darius, be careful,”’ she said. ‘And he’d say, “Ma, don’t worry.” I don’t know where to go from here ... What do I do?’
