If you're a fan of Gears of War, then Judgment promises not to disappoint. But for those looking for revolutionary gameplay, emotional storytelling and deep, multifaceted level design, you may want to look elsewhere.

Make no mistake, new developer People Can Fly - behind the brilliant Bulletstorm - have honed and perfected everything that makes a Gear of War of game great. Sadly, given how far the third-person genre has come since the Gears' inception in 2006, the welcome changes and modifications can't hide the tired gameplay.

All together now: Most of the time, your teammates' AI works well but the same can't be same for the Locust

Set as a prequel and told in flashback after the events of Emergence Day, plot follows the adventures of Kilo squad as they endeavour to save Halvo Bay from a Locust chief called Karn. Familiar faces Cole and Baird are joined by new recruits Sofia Hendrik and Garron Paduk.

Unfortunately, although it's interesting seeing the youthful exuberance of Cole and Baird, character development pales in comparison to its predecessors. There are no moments - such as the devastating death of Dom's wife Maria in the second game - that stick with you.

Instead, battles are largely forgettable - but that's not to say they're not fun. There are more enemies on screen than ever before and AI is (largely) smart enough to stop you camping and gunning down Locust at ease. Levels are now split up into sections - each one containing a 'Declassifed' optional mission.

Here, you can choose to add a variant to the level - for example allowing a toxic gas to impair vision or replace easier enemies with tougher ones. Successful completion of levels and Declassified missions rewards you with medals - which essentially act as bragging rights to other Gears players.

This, coupled with levels featuring frequent mini 'hordes' (where you must take on waves of enemies) makes the entire thing feel more 'arcade-like' than ever before - a move that may jar with some hardcore fans.

What will be universally appreciated, though, are the visuals. Judgment is easily the prettiest of the bunch. Whether it's watching Baird grimace as he mangles a Locust with his chainsaw Lancer or roadie-running across intricately bump-mapped cobbled streets, Judgment is a visual tour-de-force.

Multiplayer, too, is a triumph. Overrun mode - where a team must stop a horde of Locust troops from opening Emergence Holes - is a particular highlight. This coupled with an easy-to-use class and XP system means there's still plenty of life left after the 10-or-so hour campaign draws to a close.

Death from above: Enemies come at you thick and fast making firefights exciting. But by the end of the campaign you would have had your fill

There's no denying that Judgment is a good third-person shooter, and, if released a few years back it would be one of the greatest.

But gamers' demands have caused the third-person genre to evolve - with many wanting more than just gunning down enemies, walking to another room and doing the same over and over again.

The game has changed and Gears are beginning to grind.

Gears of War: Judgment is out now in the US and released on March 22 in Europe.
