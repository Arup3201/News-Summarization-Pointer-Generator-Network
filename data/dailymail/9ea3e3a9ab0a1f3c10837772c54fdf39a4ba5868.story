Pope Francis made a Christmas visit to Pope Emeritus Benedict on Monday and said he found his 86-year-old predecessor looking well, according to television footage released by the Vatican.

Francis, who was elected in March, spent about 30 minutes with Benedict in an ex-convent on the Vatican grounds where the former pope has been living in near isolation.

Photos released by the Vatican newspaper show the two men, dressed in identical white robes save for Francis' cape, chatting in a sitting room inside Benedict's retirement home during the visit Monday.

They also prayed together in the adjoining chapel.

'It's a pleasure to see you looking so well,' Francis told Benedict, who in February became the first pope in 600 years to step down instead of ruling for life.

Television footage released by the Vatican - only the fourth time Benedict has been filmed since his resignation - showed him looking alert and in better health than on previous occasions.

However, he was using a cane for support while they stood in prayer.

It is the first time the interior of Benedict's home has been shown publicly. The sitting room and furniture were all white. An Advent wreath decorated the coffee table.

Since Benedict's retirement in February, the two men have met only once publicly, for an official Vatican ceremony in July. They also have met privately and occasionally have spoken by telephone.

Benedict greeted Francis, 77, at the door of the residence, standing with an ivory-handled wooden cane.

They walked to a chapel where they stood and prayed before speaking privately in another room.

When Francis left Benedict, he said, 'Merry Christmas, pray for me.' Benedict responded, 'Always, always, always.'

Benedict resigned on February 28, saying he no longer had the physical and spiritual strength to lead the 1.2 billion member Roman Catholic Church.
