Women desperate for a baby are being given false hope by profit-hungry fertility clinics, Robert Winston has warned.

The IVF pioneer and broadcaster said that the private sector – which has the lion’s share of the market – is an unregulated ‘jungle’.

He said because the industry is becoming ‘more and more commercial’, women are being fast-tracked into IVF when there are cheaper treatments that might work better.

In other cases, women are paying for 
tests that could actually cut their chances of motherhood, said the 
Labour peer, who has long warned of the dangers of expensive but 
unproven fertility treatments. Lord Winston, who made his name on TV 
programmes such as Child of Our Time and The Human Body, said: ‘IVF is 
being offered as a blanket treatment when there is a whole variety of 
other things that you could do that might be more effective. What is 
happening in the jungle is actually pretty frightening.

‘Of
 course there are lots of good people doing good work but what is 
happening is that infertility is increasingly not being treated as a 
symptom. Nowadays, if you go in with a symptom of infertility, you 
automatically get IVF though there are many cheaper treatments that 
might be more effective.’

He accused the fertility watchdog of incompetence, adding that he thinks it is ‘frightened of being sued and has had its day’.

Lord
 Winston, emeritus professor of fertility studies at Imperial College 
London, also questioned whether women are informed that freezing their 
eggs does not guarantee they will have children.

He
 told a Sunday newspaper that although egg freezing is becoming ‘big 
business’, success rates are low. ‘That’s not to say it shouldn’t be 
done, provided it’s safe,’ he said. ‘But I don’t think people who are 
having their eggs frozen realise just how low their chances of having a 
baby are.’

Another 
expensive treatment may actually cut a woman’s odds of having a baby. He
 said that some clinics are over-prescribing a form of checking embryos 
for abnormalities called PGS. He said that using the test can cut the 
odds of pregnancy by as much as half, yet it is being sold to ‘desperate
 patients’.

The fertility watchdog, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, could not be contacted for its response.
