A woman who turned her life around after beating drug addiction hanged herself just months after breaking up with her boyfriend of five years, an inquest heard. 

Shirley Jensen, who developed a drug habit as a teenager in Aberdeen, went on to gain a first-class degree and secure a job as a company manager after serving time in prison for drug possession in 1992.

The 41-year-old, who had been teetotal for 20 years, was found dead in her flat in Stockport, Greater Manchester, last September after she failed to turn up at work.

A book titled 'Letting Go', which offers advice on relationship boundaries following a separation, and a note which read 'I'm sorry', were found nearby.

Her long-term relationship had ended in July when her boyfriend moved out of the  home they shared and she was in the process of looking for a flat of her own when she died. 

She had also recently started a new job after the company where she previously worked, owned by her mother, closed down.  

She told family and colleagues the pressure of the three situations had left her feeling 'stressed', Stockport Coroner's Court heard.

Her mother, Winifred Barber, told the inquest her daughter had said: 'Three of the most stressful things that can happen to a person have happened to me at the same time - I've ended a relationship, started a new job and moved house.'  

Miss Jensen, who was hailed an 'inspirational colleague' by colleagues at the auction house where she worked, was found by police after she failed to turn up for work on September 29. 

The hearing was told Miss Jensen developed her drug habit after falling in with the wrong crowd at school and in 1992 she was jailed for six months for possession of Class A drugs.

But when she was released after serving half her sentence, she vowed to get her life back on track and became teetotal at the age of 20 and went back to college to further her career and help others.

Miss Jensen moved to Manchester where she got a job as a PA before enrolling at Manchester Metropolitan University where she graduated in Sociology with Information and Communications. 

She also used her past experiences to work with Narcotics Anonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous and the Citizens' Advice Bureau. The keen traveller also took part in charity runs.

Miss Jensen's mother Winifred Barber, 63, told the Stockport hearing: 'One prison officer in the education department was trying to get her back on track and to realise her own potential. 

'Despite that it hindered her. She wanted to be a mentor at a high school but they wouldn't let her. As far as we were aware she hadn't touched alcohol or drugs since she was 20 years old.

'She attended NA and AA and helped other women to get over their experience of drugs and alcohol. 

'Despite her problem with her record she was always in regular employment or studying. She was never idle.'

Miss Jensen went on a management training course before working as an office manager for her mother's auction company where colleagues said she was a 'dynamic and inspirational leader'.

But when the company was closed down in July last year, Miss Jensen moved to a new job as an office manager with a property firm. 

It came at the same time as her five-year relationship was ending.  

Mrs Barber added: 'He moved out at the end of June/early July and the lease was due to expire on October 21 so she found a flat to move into on her own. 

'I never found out why it ended and. I was saddened by the breakup.'

'She was seeing a counsellor on a weekly basis. She didn't try to keep it a secret but she didn't discuss with me what it was regarding. 

'She always seemed to find a solution by discussing things with close friends, reading self-help books and she had used other counsellors in the past. She always tried to find a positive solution to any problem she had.

'She said jokingly the three most stressful things that can happen to a person were all happening to her at the same time. 

'She ended her relationship, started a new job and moved house. But she seemed to be taking it in her stride. She was enjoying the new job and the new challenge.'

Mrs Barber said she last saw her daughter during a family outing to New Mills, Derbyshire on 27 September. She said Miss Jensen had seemed upset but 'not distraught'. 

Later, Mrs Barber text her daughter  saying 'I hope you feel better', and she replied she would, adding, 'love you'.

Loving: Mrs Barber described her daughter, pictured, as a 'beautiful young woman'

Two days later, she received a call from a friend of Miss Jensen who reported she hadn't been to work and there were concerns she had potentially had an accident.

Miss Jensen's company had phoned the police and officers broke into the flat that evening. Concerns were raised when her manager said she was 'far too professional not to ring in'.

Mrs Barber described how her daughter had left her bills placed neatly on the dining table. 

Mrs Barber added: 'The paperwork was found on the dining room table, cheques and details. It was all dated September 28. My belief was that she left that to help me to deal with her affairs after her death. She was even thoughtful at that traumatic time in her life.'

Miss Jensen's GP, Dr Robert Mathewson, had been in contact with her since 1987. He reported early problems with alcohol and drugs and a referral to the alcohol team in 1995. 

She relapsed in 1999 and was suffering from depression, but was always reluctant to take anti-depressants, he said.

The coroner John Pollard recorded a verdict of suicide.

After the hearing, Mrs Barber said she had 'no idea whatsoever' why her daughter took her own life. 

She added: 'She was a very loving and beautiful young woman. I have great faith and a belief that I will meet her again one day and she will reveal all

'They would have given her a slap on the wrist for her offence if it happened today. But it stayed permanent on her CRB check. 

'A lot of other young people that are trying to turn their lives around can't because they have this block on it.

'I don't think it had a huge effect but when she was seeking to improve her education and in applications for certain jobs she knew it would come to the surface. She did very well in life after what happened.'
