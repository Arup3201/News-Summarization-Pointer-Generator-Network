A 27-year-old man killed his South Korean girlfriend whom he had met at a church after a ‘petty quarrel about hair being found down the plug hole’, a court heard today.

Daniel Jones allegedly murdered Da In Lee, 22, on Easter Sunday last year and attempted to hide the body under a duvet at his flat in Tipton, West Midlands, before fleeing to Bristol.

Jones admitted to his ex-partner that he had killed Miss Lee, who studied international relations and sociology at Aston University in Birmingham, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told.

The information was passed onto police
 and officers found Miss Lee's body in Jones's bed on April 9. He 
was arrested after police in Bristol found him on board a train heading 
to Birmingham.

Miss Lee met Jones at a local church 
but had ended the relationship days before her death, Gordon Aspden, 
prosecuting, told the court.

He said: 'At the time of her death Da 
In Lee was just 22. She was born and brought up in South Korea which is 
the country where her family still resides.

'She was clearly an intelligent young 
woman because she travelled half way around the world to the UK in order
 to complete her education.

‘She spoke good English and last year 
she was mid-way through a degree at Aston University in Birmingham. In 
2011 Da In Lee met Daniel Jones at a church that she attended in south 
Birmingham.

Murder: The body of Da In Lee was discovered by police at Daniel Jones's flat in the West Midlands last year

‘The two of them became friendly and 
in due course a relationship developed between them. The relationship 
gradually began to deteriorate. There were frequent arguments and rows.

'She spent the Saturday night at the 
flat with him and there appears to have been an attempt at 
reconciliation between them. But swiftly and violently it all went 
wrong. By Easter Sunday evening Da In Lee was dead'

Gordon Aspden, prosecuting

‘They would end up shouting insults. 
Miss Lee eventually finished with this defendant on March 24. 
Unfortunately later over the Easter weekend Miss Lee returned to the 
defendant's flat to see him.

'She spent the Saturday night at the 
flat with him and there appears to have been an attempt at 
reconciliation between them. But swiftly and violently it all went 
wrong.

'By Easter Sunday evening Da In Lee was dead.'

Mr Aspden added that when he was being
 quizzed by officers, Jones claimed he had killed Miss Lee by accident. 
He said: 'Jones agreed that around 7pm on Easter Sunday he had killed Da
 In Lee.

Couple: South Korean Da In Lee met Daniel Jones at church and the pair began a relationship, the court heard

'He said the background had been a 
petty quarrel over household chores and hair being found in the 
plughole. The two of them had started pushing each other.

‘He said he had caused her to fall 
over and then quickly he got on top of her. He said when Miss Lee had 
been underneath him she had struggled and screamed so he put his left 
hand over her mouth.

‘He had then taken hold of her throat 
with his right hand. He described how her face had gone a purplish blue,
 he said he had seen tears well up in her eyes and two tears rolling 
down her face.

'He said that when he was applying pressure and she was turning blue he had not intended to cause her any harm.

'He further claimed that he had 
completely lost track of time and therefore he didn't know how long it 
was he was applying pressure to her throat.

'He said the background had been a petty quarrel over household chores and hair being found in the plughole. The two of them had started pushing each other'

Gordon Aspden, prosecuting

'Throughout the incident she had been looking at him as she had been struggling but he hadn't released his grip.

'According to what he said to the police, “the outcome wasn't what I expected, I didn't expect that to happen”.

'He said all he wanted to do was to 
calm her down. He said after he had released her neck he carried her 
through to his bedroom.'

The court also heard that while in 
Bristol, Jones had used Miss Lee's mobile phone to ring a company called
 DialAFlight to try to arrange a flight to New York - but he hung up 
before it was booked. Jones denies murder. The trial continues.
