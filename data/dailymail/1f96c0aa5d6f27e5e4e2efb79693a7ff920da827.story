A mother-of-two who disappeared on a vacation with her ex-boyfriend had told family and friends that she was 'hesitant' about taking the trip with her former partner because he had been violent in the past.

Lynn Jackenheimer, 33, from Ashland, Ohio, 
was last seen around ten days ago on Hatteras Island in North Carolina with her two children and former boyfriend Nathan Summerfield. They are no longer a couple but have a three-year-old son together.

Police have named Summerfield, who has since fled, as a 'person of interest' in their search for the missing woman.

Search: Lynn Jackenheimer, left, went on vacation with her two children and ex-boyfriend Nate Summerfield, right. But he returned without her and told a relative he had strangled her before fleeing

Alex Taylor, a friend of Miss Jackenheimer, told Fox: 'I do know at one point she told Nate she was thinking about not going.

'If I really thought she was in danger, we wouldnâ€™t have let her go.'

Summerfield, 27, returned to Ohio last Sunday to drop off Miss Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter and the young boy to their grandparents' homes before fleeing in his car.

His brother Jake immediately called 911 to report 'a possible murder'.

'My brother was in North Carolina with 
his ex-girlfriend and he came back and said he strangled her. He dropped
his kid off and left,' Jake Summerfield told a dispatcher.

He added that he did not know where his brother was going when he sped away in his grey 2009 Honda Civic. Police were hunting Summerfield using his cell phone signal and when his ATM card was used.

Police had searched the homes of Miss Jackenheimer and Summerfield for clues.

Teams were also scouring the beaches in North Carolina but as one officer pointed out:'Some of these beaches are perfect spots to dump something you don't want somebody to find.'

Miss Jackenheimer had been staying in
a vacation rental home on the island with Summerfield and her children,
but authorities have found no clues as to her whereabouts at the home.

'We found nothing to date that they sent us to look for,' Dare County Sheriff's Department Chief Deputy Steve Hoggard.

The children remain with relatives in
Ohio. Both had been questioned by police but could offer little clues 
about what had happened to their mother.

Missing: Jackenheimer, who has a three-year-old son with Summerfield and a 13-year-old daughter, has not been seen or heard from in a week

Person of interest: Summerfield, left, posted a picture on Facebook of him with the children on vacation

Lynn's stepfather, Raymond Johnson, told WOIO that Miss Jackenheimer's 13-year-old daughter, who has special needs, was left at his home in Dorchester, Ohio.

'She was all by herself when we found her,' Johnson said. 'He left her in the house took the little boy to his parents' house.

'They mainly cry for their mom, that's what they are doing. We are hoping for the best that's all.'

Friends and relatives of the missing woman held a candlelight vigil on Monday at Goodfellows Pizzeria and Sports Pub in Ashland, where she works as a bartender.
