Australian Federal Police have posted a humorous post on their official Facebook page, updating the public on a drug bust by using cringeworthy fish puns.

AFP have written about an arrest in Sydney last week, in which two men were arrested for trying to import $75 million worth of drugs into Sydney hidden underneath frozen fish.

The post uses terrible 'Dad jokes' to explain that, 'Investigators knew that salmon was responsible.'

The puns don't stop there - the AFP continues:

'In an effort to stop this sort of fin becoming commonplaice, they didn't mullet over but decided that the sooner the offenders were caught the batter.

'Two men were soon floundering for an explanation.'

'Sorry if our puns give you a haddock'

Almost 17 thousand people have liked the post and applauded the police media for their sense of humour - even weighing in with their own terrible sea-themed puns.

A little bit fishy: The Australian Federal Police posted this hilarious facebook post on Monday - using the terrible 'Dad jokes' such as 'they didn't mullet over' in relation to a drug bust in which the drugs were found hidden underneath frozen fish

Two men have been arrested after attempting to import 88kg of heroin and 21kg of methamphetamines into Sydney in a frozen fish shipment

However, some commenters have taken offence to the light-hearted post, telling AFP to scale back on their use of puns.

'The drug epidemic isn't a joke, Australian Federal Police!' wrote on Facebook user, who clearly took the bait.

The AFP responded to his concerns, replying:

' I agree. But a bit of levity every now and then can breathe some life into a topic, and get more people engaged and aware.'

The Australian Federal Police (AFP) say that humour can be an important tool to communicate with the wider public.

'The AFP uses humour judiciously when posting content to the AFP Facebook page.

'The AFP posts on a variety of subjects, utilising different types of content, including humour, photographs and statistics, to increase awareness of the AFP’s role in combatting crime,' an AFP spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'This assists the AFP in raising awarenss of matters and educating the community on different crime types.'

Police charged two Canadian-Vietnamese men, aged 55 and 57, last Thursday after intercepting the 100kg drug delivery from Kuala Lumpur earlier this month.

The 100kg of Heroin and ethamphetamine were found hidden in ice packs beneath frozen fish in three pallets of white polystyrene boxes on September 8.

The AFP say they have received positive feedback about their post and their attempts to stop drug trafficking, to ensure Australia is not swimming in drugs.
