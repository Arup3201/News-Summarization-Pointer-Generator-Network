A team of Americans who have crossed the Bering Strait on jet skis are being detained at an east Russian coastal town because they do not have the correct paperwork.

The six adventurers, whose trip is being filmed for a reality TV show called Dangerous Waters, were arrested after they landed in the town of Lavrentiya in the Russian state of Chukotka on Friday.

According to the Dangerous Waters website, when they arrived at the port they were met by tanks and armed guards and they are now being detained by the Russian military.

The site says fingerprints have been taken and the men are being formally prosecuted. However, it also reports that they have been given permission to send text messages and video updates home.

In a YouTube video message from Russia expedition leader Steven Moll says 'We want to leave. They won’t let us leave.

'They’re trying to take us around town and show us museums and other little things, but all we really want to do is get some fuel and head back to the United States.

'This is ridiculous. This is Third-World. But we’re safe, and hopefully we’ll be home in the United States soon.'

The jet ski crew had begun their crossing of the Bering Strait in Nome, Alaska, and are planning to finally end up at Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.

Through text messages, videos and phone calls the men have reassured family and friends that they are in good health but are being shuffled from building to building.

According to the Sacramento Bee newspaper
Moll's wife Annette said her husband sounded 'He sounds scared,' Moll’s
wife was quoted as saying. 'I know he’s trying to make us not so 
worried here because it’s been such an emotional time. But I can tell 
he’s kind of scared.'

The
group made a successful 7,250-kilometer journey from Seattle across the
strait to Russia last year for a first series of the Dangerous Waters 
television programme.

On
the back of that effort Moll and the team were able to attract 
additional sponsors and mount the more ambitious trek to Vietnam.

Annoyed: Mr Moll said the actions of the Russian authorities was ridiculous and he hoped to be home in the United States soon

Moll’s wife said that the men were 
being kept in a 'gymlike area' and had been allowed to keep their 
phones, but that authorities had taken their documents.

In
more recent video message posted on the facebook page Moll said guards 
were now protecting their jet skis, and they had been permitted to make 
repairs. But they are still being held under close watch and are unable 
to leave.

The latest tweet
by the group posted today stated: 'Ok...we are still being held...they 
keep saying we'll be released soon...but now saying maybe tomorrow...we 
are all trying to stay positive.'

Annette Moll said her husband was waiting to appear before a judge and could face prosecution or fines.

It
is unclear whether the jet skiers were aware they required special 
permissions in addition to a Russian visa to enter the Chukotka region.

The State Department said it is aware of the situation and is monitoring it, the Sacramento Bee reported

In some cases, deportees can be barred from re-entering the country for five years.

Previous effort: Moll successfully crossed the Bering Strait with a team last year and was able to secure sponsorship for this longer journey on the back of that success
