John Terry has hailed the goal knack of defender Branislav Ivanovic and claims it is down to 'desire' and 'strength' not good fortune.

Ivanovic scored Chelsea's goal in a 1-1 draw in the Champions League away to PSG to enhance his reputation for scoring crucial goals at key moments in big matches.

'He has scored some important goals for us,' said captain Terry. 'Look at the Liverpool one a couple of weeks ago. He pops up in the final of the Europa League. He really is a top player for the team. It's a desire and hunger he's got and the aggression and strength he's got to want to firstly get in those positions and secondly out-strength the opponent and be a lot hungrier.'

John Terry claims it is no fluke that Ivanovic pops up to score important goals in big games for Cheslea

Ivanovic scored an extra-time winner against Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final last month and his header to beat Benfica and win the Europa League final in 2013 has it's place in Chelsea history.

In Paris, the goal was the work of three quarters of Chelsea's back-four with Gary Cahill flicking Terry's low cross into the air for Ivanovic to finish.

'Yeah, it was all about the low cross,' joked Terry. 'I said to Gaz I'd seen him. No, I just managed to whip it in. I don't know why or what I was doing there but it was a great flick from Gaz and more importantly a great header from Iva.'

Edinson Cavani equalised but Chelsea hung on, with a little luck and some fabulous saves by goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, who was recalled in favour if Petr Cech.

'It's unlucky for Big Pete,' said Terry. 'He made two unbelievable saves from Lukaku against Everton last week, but he has been unbelievably professional around the club this season. I've seen a lot of players in my time throw their toys out of the pram.

'He's been different class for the team, and that's been important. The manager stresses the importance of the team coming first. They're both there for the whole squad. Both of them have been excellent.

'We've got the two best goalkeepers in the world in my opinion both fighting for one place. It's difficult. You can't keep them both happy. The manager manages to do it, I don't know how. Obviously they both want to play all the time. But the two of them are at the top of their games. Rotating them is a tough job. I'd rather that was the manager's decision.'

Jose Mourinho faces the tricky decision of which goalkeeper to select in the Capital One Cup final against Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday week.

'Pete's played most of the games (in the Capital One Cup) and Thibaut played the last round. But the manager's always stressed the team comes first. That's the most important thing.'

Cech's contract expires next year and there will be a clamour for his signature at the end of the season.

Terry said: 'We've not even spoken and credit to Pete, he's not rumbled the dressing room or sent shockwaves through the dressing room. He's been really professional.

'He knows he's been a top keeper and still is a keeper with a lot to give. He's fighting for his place. He hasn't just given up and said "it's your Thibaut". When he's come in he's had to be brilliant and given the manager food for thought.

'He could play for anyone. He's been different class for us. He's worth 10-12 points every season.'
