A report into the 'chokehold' death of Eric Garner says he was not in 'great distress' before falling unconscious.

The father, 43, died in Staten Island during an arrest on Thursday after being held down and handcuffed by veteran NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo.

Disturbing video footage shows Garner, who was accused of selling illegal cigarettes, struggling on the pavement saying 'I can't breath' before passing out.

Victim: Eric Garner, 43, died after being held in a 'chokehold' by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island. An initial report into his death has said he was 'not in great distress

Minutes later, Pantaleo waved to the camera as the father was taken away on a stretcher. 'He got the nerve to wave,' the woman behind the camera says.

When one of the witnesses asked, 'Why is nobody doing CPR?' an officer responded, 'Because he's breathing.' 

But an initial investigation into the death said that Garner 'was not in great distress' and his health 'did not seem to get worse' as he was held down.  

Sergeant Dhanan Saminath said Garner was in handcuffs with officers 'maintaining control of him' according to the report seen by the New York Daily News. 

It also suggests that he 'resisted arrest' and failed to 'obey instructions' as police tried to handcuff him. 

However Sergeant Kizzy Adonis said she 'believed she heard the perpetrator state that he was having difficulty breathing'. 

The New York City Medical Examiner's office has not yet been able to determine what killed Garner - whether he died from a chokehold or an underlying health issue. 

Pantaleo, a plainclothes cop, has been forced to surrender his gun and badge and put on desk duty while the NYPD investigates the case.

Treatment: A witness asked why no one was giving him CPR, to which officers respond 'because he is breathing'  

It has also 
been revealed that he has seven civil rights lawsuit against him - 
including allegations of illegal strip searches and arresting men who 
were 'committing no crimes' at the time.

One
 resulted in the city paying $30,000 to two men who were unlawfully 
strip-searched. The other lawsuit, which is still pending, alleges an 
unlawful arrest. 

Garner's grieving son, meanwhile, has called for the New York Police Department officer who was filmed putting his father in a chokehold to be arrested and thrown in jail. 

This isn't the first time Pantaleo has been accused of abusing his police powers, the Staten Island Advance reports. The eight-year veteran officer has had two civil rights lawsuits filed against him.

The first was the result of a March 2012 traffic stop in which Darren Collins and Tommy Rice were arrested and then strip-searched in broad daylight on a Staten Island street. 

Gwen, Mr Garner's mother, said she was glad the incident was recorded so police could not shy away from what happened.
