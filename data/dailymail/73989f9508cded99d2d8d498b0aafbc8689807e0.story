A former Los Angeles police detective was found guilty today of the 26-year-old murder of the wife of her former lover in a case that hinged on a single piece of evidence - DNA from a bite mark on the victim's arm.

Stephanie Lazarus, 51, of Los Angeles, beat and shot dead Sherri Rasmussen, 29, in February 1986 
after her lover John Reutten wed the hospital nursing director instead 
of her.

The first-degree murder conviction came after a three-week trial that included testimony from a forensic expert who said the DNA was a match to defendant Lazarus.

Her defense attorney countered that the 
DNA was packaged improperly and deteriorated while stored in a coroner's
freezer for two decades. He also suggested there might have been 
evidence tampering.

The case was submitted to jurors on Tuesday after intense closing arguments by both sides. After a day and a half of deliberation, the panel of eight women and four men delivered its decision.

Victim Sherri Rasmussen was bludgeoned and shot to death in 1986 in the condo she shared with her husband of three months.

Detectives initially believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame.

But two decades later, a cold case team using DNA analysis concluded the killer was a woman and authorities began looking at Lazarus as a suspect.

During the trial, prosecutors focused on the relationship of Lazarus and John Ruetten, who became her lover after they graduated from college.

He testified that he never intended to 
marry Lazarus, although they were intimate for about a year. He also 
said she enticed him into having sex with her shortly before his 
wedding.

'Here's the deal,' he testified. 'It was clear she was very upset that I was getting married and moving on.'

'Heaven has no
rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.' 

Prosecutor Shannon Presby

Lazarus' lawyer, Mark Overland, ridiculed the claim of a fatal attraction between Lazarus and Ruetten, saying she never tried to reunite with her former lover after his wife was gone.

'So this obsessing with John must have fizzled out I guess,' he said.

Shocking close-up death pictures of the 
battered face of Mrs Rasmussen were presented to jurors during the trial of 
Lazarus, showing one eye swollen shut and the other wide open.

Mrs Rasmussen's mouth was open wide, her 
hands held up as if in a defensive posture.

Lazarus went on to marry another 
policeman and adopt a daughter. She rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles
Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and 
thefts.

Overland also pointed to the lack of physical evidence against her. No blood, fingerprints, hair or fibers connected her to the scene.

But prosecutor Shannon Presby told jurors the case was based on more than just DNA. At the outset of the trial, he said it featured 'a bite, a bullet, a gun barrel and a broken heart'.

He said a bite on Mrs Rasmussen's arm 
contained saliva that was matched to Lazarus's DNA more than two decades
after the killing.

Lazarus' gun was never found, but Mr Presby called experts to testify that bullets fired into Rasmussen's body matched those issued to police officers in 1986.

Mr Presby drove home the idea in his closing 
argument with a familiar line from poet William Congreve: 'Heaven has no
rage like love to hatred turned, nor hell a fury like a woman scorned.'

Lazarus' husband attended most of the trial along with other family members.

Ruetten sat across the courtroom with Rasmussen's family.

The defendant and her white-haired former boyfriend never looked at each other.

But their past moved before them on screen as both sides showed pictures of them as a young couple.

Among the trial's most dramatic moments came when Ruetten testified tearfully about finding his wife slain. He said it never entered his mind that Lazarus might be responsible. 

Last month, Rasmussen family lawyer John Taylor said: ‘It took 26 years to get here finally. The family is pleased to get the trial going.'

It was the first time in living memory that an active-duty LAPD officer was arrested on a murder charge and later convicted, according to the Los Angeles Times.
