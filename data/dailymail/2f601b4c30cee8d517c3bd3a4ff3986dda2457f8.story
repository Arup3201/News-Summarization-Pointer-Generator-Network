A retired Swiss airline pilot flying around the world for the last two years in a plane he built himself has been arrested after straying into Indonesian airspace.

Heinz Peier, 65, was forced to land by Indonesian fighter jets today before being surrounded by armed soldiers at Soewondo Air Base where he was arrested.

According to his blog, Peier was due to travel from Sri Lanka to the Philippines when the arrest happened, and was not planning to stop in Indonesia.

A Swiss pensioner flying around the world in an aircraft he built himself has been arrested in Indonesia after flying into the country's airspace illegally, according to an Air Force spokesman

Former Swiss airline pilot Heinz Peier, 65, has been flying around the world almost non-stop since February 2012. According to his blog, he was planning to fly between Sri Lanka and the Philippines when the arrest happened

However, according to an Indonesian Air Force official, Peier was on a ferry flight from Colombo to Singapore when he entered their airspace illegally, suggesting that he may have changed his route.

In the pictures he is surrounded by soldiers who point their guns at him while he climbs out of his aircraft before being taken away.

Peier began his travels in February 2012 when he flew to Belize, South America, using a red Swearingen SX300 aircraft he constructed himself.

while on his travels Mr Peier has visited six continents - including Antarctica - and stopped in more than 100 cities

It is not clear whether Peier is being held by the Indonesian authorities, or whether he has been released

Since then he has travelled almost non-stop for two years, taking in six continents - including Antarctica - visiting around 30 countries, and stopping in more than 100 cities.

On his travels he has toured safari parks, ridden on elephants, sailed around glaciers and even took part in a cycle race in his native Switzerland.

He flies solo, stopping only to refuel and take in some sights before jetting off again. He is sometimes joined by his two grown-up daughters, Celcilia and Bianca.

Swiss national Peier now lives in Daytona Beach, Florida after retiring from his career as an airline pilot

In his last post, dated two days ago in Sri Lanka, Peier says he is due to visit the temple of Kanda after staying the night in the Sri Lankan mountains.

He also discussed refueling his plane beforehand in case he needs to depart 'on a moment's notice.'

It is not clear if Peier is being held by the Indonesian authorities or if he is has been released.
