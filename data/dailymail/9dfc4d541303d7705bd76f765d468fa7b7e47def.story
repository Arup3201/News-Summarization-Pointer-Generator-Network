Firefighters rushed to the scene to assess the damage. 

Eyewitnesses said two of the women had head injuries but managed to free themselves while another was stuck under the debris.

Rescue workers took all three victims out of the store on stretchers to nearby Hahnemann University Hospital. 

NBC News has named Allison Friedman as one of the victims.

Her father Howard Edelman told NBC10 his daughter was shopping inside the store with two friends at the time of the accident.

'The toughest part is that it's your kid. 'No matter how old. She said all of a sudden they heard rumbling and the next thing you know, she was at the bottom, buried.'

Friedman, a newlywed and local teacher is recovering at home. While she's in pain, her father is happy she made it out alive.

'It couldve been a lot worse,' he said. 'We're very, very lucky. She will be fine.'

All three victims, including Edelmman, were released from the hospital on Tuesday evening.

According to inspectors, the bricks which caused the 20-foot wide hole in Lululemon's roof were from a penthouse elevator shaft at 1529 Walnut - which is next door to the store.

An eyewitness described the scene to ABC 6 News: 'It shook, it shook. It was intense, very intense.' 

Lulemon Customer Christine Vamvalis-Haley added: 'The lighting, the whole ceiling and the roof and the sidewall, everything just came crashing down.'  

The adjacent building only has one tenant - a law firm.  

Attorney, Louis Bove, who works for the firm, said he was  working on the top floor of the adjacent building, when he heard 'a really loud crash that shook my desk.' 

Then he looked out and saw the hole in Lululemon's roof and bricks scattered nearby. But he described the landlord of his building as 'great.'

Shock: An eyewitness described the scene to ABC 6 News : 'It shook, it shook. It was intense, very intense'

City records show that the landlord has no history of maintenance violations, and has already taken full responsibility for the accident at the athletic store.  

Records also showed that the owner of 1529 Walnut is the Walnut Street Association.

Sources told ABC 6 News that employees from Lululemon had been interviewed by Central Detectives who told them there had been a leak in their roof for weeks.

L&I says the owner of the Lululemon building, Leis Family Associates, is also cooperating with the investigation.
