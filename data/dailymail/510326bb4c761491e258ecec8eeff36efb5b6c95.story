'Disgrace': Barrister Robert Colover has been criticised by campaigners for describing a 13-year-old victim of a sex abuse case 'predatory'

David Cameron yesterday condemned a prosecution barrister for describing the 13-year-old victim of a paedophile as sexually ‘predatory’.

He urged the courts to ‘stand up for  victims’ after Neil Wilson, 41, escaped jail despite luring the girl to his home, where she performed a sex act on him.

Child protection campaigners labelled barrister Robert Colover a ‘disgrace’ and called for his dismissal. They also warned that his ‘crass’ comments would stop other young abuse victims from coming forward.

Mr Colover has been suspended from prosecuting sex trials after he told Snaresbrook Crown Court in London that the girl ‘forced’ herself on Wilson, describing her as ‘predatory in all her actions’ and ‘sexually experienced’.

He said: ‘She appeared to look around 14 or 15 and had the mental age of a 14 or 15-year-old. There was sexual activity but it was not of Mr Wilson’s doing.

‘You might say it was forced upon him despite his being older and stronger than her.’

Judge Nigel Peters, QC, is also being investigated for telling Wilson the girl was ‘egging you on’ and that she looked and behaved ‘a little bit older’ than her age as he gave him a suspended sentence.

Wilson admitted two counts of making extreme pornographic images and one count of sexual activity with a child. His own solicitor told Monday’s sentencing hearing that the paedophile could still pose a risk to children.

In a separate move, it emerged that sex offence trials involving vulnerable children will be conducted by a newly chosen team of specially vetted judges, to protect child witnesses from  brutal cross-examination by trial barristers.

Under fire: Judge Nigel Peters is also being investigated for suggesting the victim was 'egging on' paedophile Neil Wilson

Neil Wilson spotted his victim amid the bustle of Romford town centre at the start of March last year.

The 13-year-old girl was playing truant from school and wandering the streets asking strangers for cigarettes.

Wilson obliged when she asked him – offering her an entire packet. He then took her back to his flat near the town centre for coffee.

The girl allegedly looked around 14 or 15 and acted as if she was older than her years.

However, she was clearly underage – and nearly three decades younger than Wilson who was 39 at the time.

Over the next two weeks the pair enjoyed a brief ‘fling’, Snaresbrook Crown Court heard.

The girl was described by the prosecutor and judge as a ‘sexual predator’. But during this time it was Wilson who bombarded her with phone calls and text messages as she continued to visit his home, the court heard.

On March 20, exactly two weeks after her first visit, the girl went back to Wilson’s flat after they agreed to meet. They sat in his lounge and talked about their relationship.

Wilson claims at this point he told her they had to stop seeing each other because they would get in trouble.

The girl, who was dressed in her school uniform, asked if she could change out of it and Wilson left the room. When he returned she had undressed and was sat wearing a T-shirt.

Wilson claims he asked her to put her clothes on, but she started kissing him before touching his genitals. He said he pushed her away and told her he did not want to see her any more. At no point did they have sex.

Robert Colover, prosecuting, told the court that the sexual activity was ‘not of Mr Wilson’s doing’. He added: ‘You might say it was forced upon him despite being older and stronger than her.’

The abuse came to light only when the girl told a friend what happened and the police were called.

When officers went to Wilson’s home, they found images of child sexual abuse and videos depicting bestiality on his computer.

Four of the images were surreptitiously taken photographs of children in play areas or other safe environments showing either underwear or varying degrees of nakedness.

There were also 11 sexually explicit images involving horses and dogs.

Wilson told police that he watched hardcore pornography but that he had deleted it from his computer.

Yesterday the Prime Minister said it was ‘absolutely right’ that the Crown Prosecution Service had rebuked Mr Colover for his comments.

He said: ‘It isn’t appropriate. We need a criminal justice system that stands up properly for victims. The victims should always be at the centre of our thinking.

‘The CPS themselves have said that this isn’t appropriate, the Attorney General is going to look into the case and we need a system that properly stands up for victims.’

Marilyn Hawes, director of child protection charity Enough Abuse, said: ‘This needs to be nipped in the bud. Are we in 1913 or 2013? Judges and barristers should be removed if they use language like this.

‘Vulnerable witnesses won’t come forward if they are going to be treated this way in court. They are fragile children, they are not just pieces of evidence to be used in a case.'

Emily Thornberry, Labour’s Shadow Attorney General, said: ‘It is appalling that after the scandals of Jimmy Savile and Rochdale these awful Lolita prejudices are still being served up in court, and by the prosecution of all people.’

She has written to the Bar Standards Board to examine whether Mr Colover violated its code of conduct.

Investigation: The Crown Prosecution Service has launched a probe following the case at Snaresbrook Crown Court

Charity Victim Support also condemned the teenager’s treatment. Its chief executive Javed Khan said: ‘It is completely unacceptable for victims to be blamed in any way for the abuse they have suffered.

‘The state owes a duty of care to victims and witnesses, which in this case appears to have been woefully neglected. We have strenuously campaigned for cultural change to this often adversarial, aggressive courts system.’

There was further anger yesterday as a high profile human rights lawyer appeared to defend the prosecutor’s comments.

Barbara Hewson, a barrister for Hardwicke Chambers, tweeted: ‘It takes two to tango. Disgusting tho’ these men are, frankly the girls are often not much better – and no shrieking martyrs.’

The CPS said: ‘The word predatory in this context should not have been used and is of real concern to the CPS. The Director of Public Prosecutions will be undertaking a review of this case to determine what happened and to decide what action needs to be taken.

The Attorney General’s Office said the case had been drawn to its attention ‘as a possibly unduly lenient sentence’.

The Office for Judicial Complaints said it would consider a number of complaints it had received about Judge Peters’s remarks.

There was no answer at Mr Colover’s £900,000 home in Streatham, South London, yesterday.
