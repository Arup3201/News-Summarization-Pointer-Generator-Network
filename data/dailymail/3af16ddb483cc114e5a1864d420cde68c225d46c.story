A leading force in football's battle
against racism has been criticised after he called an Asian supporter a 'coconut'.

Piara Powar, who is the
executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe (FARE)
organisation, has been a vocal figure in the game's recent rows.

But an exchange on Twitter has left Mr Powar, who is also Asian, embroiled in a race controversy of his own making.

Outburst: In a Twitter exchange Piara Powar, executive director of the Football Against Racism in Europe, sparked fury by telling Asian football fan Parmjit Singh not to be 'a coconut' 

Liverpool fan Parmjit Singh, 34, tweeted
@piarapower: 'Interesting how u haven't given your opinion on the news that a
£mufc fan was arrested on Wednesday for alleged racial abuse.'

He received a staggering reply from Mr
Powar, who used Twitter's private messaging function to contact Mr Singh, which
said: 'Get lost Singh. Have no false consciousness. Don't be a coconut.'

Mr Singh was referring to Manchester United fan Howard Hobson, 57, who was today fined £200 for chanting racist abuse at a black Stoke City player during a match on January 31.

Mr Powar had earlier condemned Liverpool FC and
the way it handled the Luis Suarez affair - where the striker was banned for eight games after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra during a match against Manchester United in October.

Manifesto: In a statement on its website FARE sets out the organisation's aim to tackle racism at all levels of the game

And Powar also condemned the alleged racist abuse by a Liverpool supporter towards Oldham Athletic's Tom Adeyemi last month.A 'coconut' is an extremely derogatory
term used to accuse someone of betraying their heritage by pandering to 'white'
opinion.

It stems from a coconut being brown on the
outside and white on the inside.

Mr Singh, a postman from the West
Midlands, is appalled by Mr Powar's comments and has branded him a 'hypocrite'.

Use of the 'coconut' label also caused outrage two years ago.

In 2010, Shirley Brown, a black Liberal
Democrat councillor, used the phrase to describe her Tory opponent, Jay Jethwa,
after she backed spending cuts for ethnic minority projects at a Bristol City
Council meeting.

Brown was found guilty of racially
aggravated harassment and given a 12-month conditional discharge.

He said: 'At first I was shocked because
in all my life I have never been called a coconut.

'I've been called p**i, a rag head and
other racist names by non-Asians but never a coconut.

'It is more insulting to me to be called a
coconut than a rag head because some of the people who used that term are just
ignorant.

'But for one Asian to call another Asian
man a coconut is like being called a traitor. It is like saying you're
betraying your own race or roots, in my opinion.'

Mr Powar, who has been criticised by a
number of football fans for his 'coconut' jibe, has now 'protected' his Twitter
account so only his followers can read his tweets.

Mr Singh added: 'I think he is a hypocrite
and a person who has an agenda against Liverpool FC. He didn't comment on the
Man United fan who was arrested.

'If he is against racism then he shouldn't
be selective on who he chooses to condemn.'

A spokesperson for FARE and Mr Powar
declined to comment.

Man United fan fined £200 for racist chant and
monkey noises during game

Manchester United fan Howard Hobson outside Trafford Magistrates' Court today

A Manchester United fan who hurled racist
abuse at a black player was today fined £200 and banned from football matches
for three years.

Howard Hobson, 57, shouted: "You f*****g
w**! You f*****g n*****!" and made monkey noises at Stoke City's Trinidad-born
player Kenwyne Jones.

Hobson was in the North Stand at Old
Trafford for the game against Stoke on January 31, Trafford Magistrates Court
heard.

The defendant was asked to explain his
actions after pleading guilty to a single charge of a racially
aggravated public order offence.

'I'm not racist,' he told the bench.

'I have coloured people in my family and
most of my best mates are coloured. I don't know what came over me. I'm deeply
sorry.'

Eileen Rogers, prosecuting, told the court
Hobson's behaviour was brought to the attention of club stewards at the match
by a witness sitting near the defendant.

'The match started - sitting a short
distance away, he heard words being uttered,' Ms Rogers said.

Hobson, 57, who hurled racist abuse at a black player, was fined £200 and banned from football matches for three years. He is seen here leaping a fence after leaving court today

'During the first half, every time the
Stoke City player Kenwyne Jones was tackled, or went down with injury, all of a
sudden he heard voices shouting, "You f*****g w**, you f*****g n*****".

'Plus also he was shouting various
utterings of monkey towards the player.

'The comments were directed to the Stoke
City player Kenwyne Jones, a player who originates from Trinidad.'

Hobson shouted: "You f*****g w**! You f*****g n*****!" and made monkey noises at Stoke City's Trinidad-born player Kenwyne Jones (above)

After the half-time interval when Hobson
returned to his seat, he was spoken to by stewards and taken away and then
transferred to a police station in Salford.

Hobson, of Openshaw,
Manchester, who is not a season ticket holder at Old Trafford, told officers he
had come to the match straight from his job as a fork lift truck driver and
drank four bottles of beer but was not drunk.

He admitted making some comments about the
Stoke player 'in the heat of the moment' and accepted he used the words, 'black
b*****d'.

He said he could not remember using the
words 'w**' or 'monkey' but accepted what the witness had reported him as
saying.

Rachel Goode, mitigating said the
defendant was 'extremely embarrassed' by his behaviour.

'He has serious concerns he will lose his
job as a result of this,' she told the bench.

'He can't really explain his actions on
that day. It's out of character for him.

'He has family and friends of mixed race
and he's now branded a racist.'

Hobson was fined £200 and ordered to pay a
£15 victim surcharge and £85 court costs.

The football banning order means he is not
allowed to enter a football ground in England and Wales for three years or he
could be arrested and he must surrender his passport when England play
internationals abroad.
