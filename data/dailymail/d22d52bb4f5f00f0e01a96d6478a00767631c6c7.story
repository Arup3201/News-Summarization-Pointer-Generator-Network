Arsenal will not qualify for the Champions League as Chelsea, Manchester United, City and Liverpool will finish in the top four, believes Phil Neville.

The 38-year-old predicts Arsenal will not qualify for Europe's elite competition for the first time under Wenger, and that his former club United will even finish second behind champions Chelsea.

'For me Chelsea are going to win the league. I think they'll win it with three or four games to spare,' Neville said, as reported by The Express.

How the top of the Premier League is shaping up

'I'm going for an outside bet of Manchester United finishing second and then I'm for City and Liverpool.'

For Neville's prediction to come true, Liverpool will have to make up a six-point gap between themselves and Arsenal in the Barclays Premier League. 

The teams are currently away during the international break but the race for the top four continues on Saturday, with Arsenal vs Liverpool the early match at the Emirates.
