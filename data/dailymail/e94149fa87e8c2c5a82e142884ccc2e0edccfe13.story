This is the shocking moment a group of youths started launching beer bottles from a bridge on to a motorway below.

Around 30 youngsters were spotted throwing items from an old railway bridge over the M61 at 11.15 pm on Thursday night.

It is thought that the items were being thrown at road workers who were carrying out repairs on the motorway in Greater Manchester between junction three and four near Bolton.
