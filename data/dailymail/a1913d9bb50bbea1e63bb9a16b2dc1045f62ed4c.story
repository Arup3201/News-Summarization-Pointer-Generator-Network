British business will lose £300 billion to gridlock over the next 16 years, new research has shown.  

A new report by the Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that London will be the worst-hit city 

Already, across Britain, motorists are losing days of their lives in gridlock with drivers spending up to 91 hours a year stuck on some congested routes. 

Drivers travelling between Aldwych and Henlys roundabout in west London, waste on average 91 hours a year in gridlock. 

Those going just five miles between Thornton Heath and Westminster Bridge are stuck an extra 63 hours, and according to the CEBR, the situation is only going to get worse.

Some London commuters already spend 91 hours a year of their journey at a complete standstill 

By 2030 motorists in Britain will spend the equivalent of 18 working days a year stuck in traffic 

The CEBR claims that by 2030, congestion will cost the average British family £2,000 a year. For business, the cumulative cost of delays, time lost and associated inefficiency take £300 billion out of the economy over the next 16 years. 

In London, congestion will cost the average family more than £4,000 a year by 2030, as the capital is expected to suffer worse gridlock than Los Angeles, Paris and New York.  

According to the CEBR, last year congestion cost the UK economy £13 billion. that is set to rise to more than £21 billion by 2030. 

By 2030, the average motorist will spend the equivalent of 18 working days a year stuck in traffic - with those in the capital spending up to 40 working days a year gridlocked.  

The CEBR conducted their study along with traffic experts INRIX who use in car sat-nav systems to capture traffic data. 

They studied the UK's 18 largest urban areas to discover the extent of traffic delays. 

These include Belfast, Birmingham, Bradford-Leeds, Bristol, Cardiff, Coventry, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Kingston-upon-Hull, Leicester, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham, Portsmouth, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent.  

Rising congestion in London is expected to cost families in the capital on average £4,000 each by 2030

The INRIX report concludes: ‘Between 2013 and 2030, the total cumulative cost of congestion to the UK economy is estimated to be a staggering £307billion.’ 

Of that £307billion - equivalent to nearly a fifth (18 per cent) of the nation’s productive wealth  last year - some £191billion is in the form of ‘direct costs ‘ such as the value of fuel and the time wasted by not being productive at work. 

A further £115billion is in the form of ‘indirect costs’ which relate to higher transport and freight costs and business fees from company vehicles idling in traffic, which are passed on to consumers as additional costs to household bills.

The report notes that in the UK last year, almost 70 per cent of the workforce commuted to work by car during peak times, with the average British driver spending 124 hours stuck in gridlock annually. 

‘This is set to rise to 136 hours in 2030, equivalent to 18 working days a year. This has both a direct and indirect economic impact on car commuting households,' the report says.

And adds: ‘In London, the UK’s most congested city, drivers spent more than 250 hours idling in traffic in 2013, which is double the UK average. This is set to increase to 299 hours in 2030, equivalent to 40 working days a year.'

It says that although fewer than a third of Londoners commute to work by car, the cost of living and the value of time for the capital’s 1.4 million car commuters is at such a premium that it will cost ‘each car commuting household more than £4,000 a year by 2030.’

Matt Simmons, European director of INRIX said: ‘This study is a warning of the worsening impact of gridlock on the British economy and on household budgets.

‘We now know that congestion will continue to have serious consequences for national and city economies, businesses and citizens in the years to come. If we think this problem is bad now, we are in for a terrible shock come 2030.’
