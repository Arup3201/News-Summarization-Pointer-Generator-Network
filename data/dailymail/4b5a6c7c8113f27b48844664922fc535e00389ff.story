Pape Souare is being considered by Queens Park Rangers as they weigh up potential recruits for left-back.

The Senegal international, 24, plays for Lille in France and was linked with Arsenal earlier last season.

Harry Redknapp's side took Benoit Assou-Ekotto on loan from Tottenham for the majority of last season but that deal has now expired.

Considered: Former Arsenal target Pape Souare is one of the players QPR are looking at this summer

Souare could be just one of many new faces at QPR next season with Redknapp keen to bolster his squad ahead of their return to the Premier League.

They have approached free agent Rio Ferdinand following the expiry of his contract at Manchester United.

And Brede Hangeland is also interesting the club following his departure from Fulham.

Options: Rio Ferdinand has kept his options open so far but he is wanted by QPR

Experience: Brede Hangeland would be a solid addition to the QPR ranks after leaving Fulham
