A passenger jet bound for the US was forced to make an unscheduled landing in Ireland when a woman went into labour less than an hour after take-off yesterday.

The Delta Airlines flight crew declared a medical emergency while the plane, en route to Atlanta from Amsterdam, was over Blackpool, England.

The transatlantic jet, carrying 230 passengers and crew, was diverted to Shannon Airport so the woman could be taken to hospital.

Medical emergency: The plane was en route to Atlanta from Amsterdam when it diverted to Shannon, Ireland

There were fears the woman would give birth on the plane because her contractions were getting ‘closer’, according to a report in The Clare Herald.

The Boeing 767-300 landed safely and was met by paramedics, who assessed the woman and then rushed her to University Maternity Hospital Limerick by ambulance.  

The woman, who was almost full term, gave birth shortly after she was admitted to hospital, the newspaper reported.

The Delta Airlines flight continued its transatlantic journey about two hours after it was forced to land.

Flying while pregnant? Delta Airlines has no restrictions and does not require a letter from a doctor

Most airlines require pregnant women to provide a letter of consent or a letter from a doctor or midwife if they are flying within a month of their due date.

Delta Airlines has no restrictions and does not require a medical certificate, but it encourages pregnant women to discuss air travel with a doctor before booking a ticket.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said there is no significant risk associated directly with air travel during pregnancy, even at advanced gestation.

The college said there is no evidence that flying causes early labour or a woman’s water to break.
