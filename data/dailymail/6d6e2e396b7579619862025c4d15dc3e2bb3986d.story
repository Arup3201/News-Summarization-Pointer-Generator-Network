A fierce thunderstorm swept through a rural Wisconsin county that was packed with holiday campers, toppling trees that killed an 11-year-old girl, blowing ashore boats and injuring more than three dozen people, officials said Saturday.

The storm moved across Minnesota and Wisconsin on Friday, packing winds up to 110 miles per hour and hail as large as softballs.

In northern Wisconsin's Burnett County, at least 37 people went to hospitals after the storm toppled hundreds of trees and left several thousand utility customers without power.

The Log Cabin Hollow campground on Yellow Lake near Webster, Wisconsin sustained heavy damage in Friday evening's storm

Three of those injuries were reported as critical.

Dawn Sargent, a Burnett County public information officer, told MailOnline.com that all missing persons had been accounted for by Saturday evening.

A search was undertaken earlier in the day along the St. Croix River for missing canoeists, the Wisconsin Emergency Management Office reported.

Boats were upended and blown ashore in the area, while an airport hangar in neighbouring Douglas County collapsed.

Law enforcement reported the girl who died was killed when a tree fell 
on her at a campground in the country.

Ms Sargent would provide additional details of the girl's death, claiming that not all of her family has been notified yet.

But the local Inter-County Leader quoted the Burnett County Sheriff's Department as claiming that the 11-year-old was from 
Hinckley, Minnesota.

The paper reported that the girl was killed when a tree fell on her at Scenic View 
Campground on Poquette Lake, about 15 miles east of Siren.

Ms Sargent told MailOnline.com that a
second death was believed to be connected to the storm, after a man 
between the ages of 50 and 60 died of a heart attack.

The Inter-County Leader reported that the man's death was initially thought to 
have been related to the storm but that authorities said Saturday afternoon 
it was not related.

The 
storm came at one of the worst times of the year for rural Burnett 
County: a summer holiday weekend, when the area's lakes and rivers 
attract tens of thousands of visitors, said Julie Kittleson of the 
county's emergency response centre.

Ms
Kittleson said: 'The population here is about 15,000. But this weekend 
there's probably about 80,000', she said of the county, which is about 
90 miles northeast of Minneapolis.

The
storm moved into southwest Minnesota on Friday afternoon and took 
nearly six hours to pass through before slipping into northwest 
Wisconsin, said Matt Friedlein, a National Weather Service 
meteorologist.

The bad weather had moved out by Saturday morning, when skies were clear and sunny with temperatures in the 80s.

Most of the damage occurred from the west side of Yellow Lake northeast to Birch Island Lake.

The village of Grantsburg is shut down as authorities worry about gas leaks from uprooted trees.

The Burnett County Emergency Operations Center has been activated in Siren for victims of the storm.

Anita
Frase, the owner of Bay Park Resort & Campground in Trego, said she
and the resort's 300 visitors knew a storm was coming but they didn't 
expect it to hit so swiftly and with such intensity.

Ms Frase said: 'About 9 o'clock the winds picked up and within five minutes it was upon us. Those were probably the darkest skies I've ever seen up here'.

She added that the storm knocked down several trees, with some landing on vehicles.

'A lot of people were very nervous. Some of the kids were crying', she said.

Workers were also rattled at a Grantsburg store near the St. Croix River that rents canoes, kayaks and gear.

Store clerk Aimee Van Tatenhove said the wind was so strong and loud that no one realized a medium-sized tree had fallen into the roof until employees went outside.

In Minnesota, a driver was injured when hail the size of a baseball hit a vehicle's windshield, said Meeker County Sheriff Jeff Norlin. Roofs were torn away in several towns.

McLeod County Emergency Management Director Kevin Mathews said: 'Some communities had multiple passes at this storm - including golfball-, baseball- and softball-sized hail'.

Mr Mathews added that two tractor-trailers were blown off local highways.

Two Minnesota state parks sustained tree damage so heavy that a conservation officer who was making sure no campers were in the area had to abandon his vehicle and hike through on foot, said Chris Niskanen of the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.

Mr Niskanen urged people to stay out of Camden State Park and St. Croix State Park, which are technically closed because of the state's government shutdown but could still attract campers because they're public land.

He cautioned that some trees may have fallen over but gotten hung up on other trees.

Mr Niskanen said: 'It's an issue of health and safety. Since those parks are closed they don't have the personnel to go in and remove (the trees). People need to know there's a danger if they start wandering around'.
