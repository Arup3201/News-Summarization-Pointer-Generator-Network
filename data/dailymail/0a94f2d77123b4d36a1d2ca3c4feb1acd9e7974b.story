Staff at Bristol Airport have identified the owner of this 100-year-old teddy bear as Nicholas James Baker, who died during World War One in Baghdad

The owner of a a 100-year-old teddy bear found abandoned at an airport has finally been identified.

The antique bear, which has one eye and a floppy ear, was found last year in a bag with a frayed black and white photo, dated March 1918, of him being cuddled by two little girls.

Unlike Paddington Bear, the toy had no name tag but a message in faded ink on the back of the picture read: 'With dearest love and kisses to our darling Daddie from your loving little daughters Dora and Glyn.'

Staff at Bristol Airport made a public appeal to try and trace the owner earlier this year and have now identified ‘Daddie’ as Nicholas James Baker.

He was killed during World War One in Baghdad just a month after the picture was taken and was buried in a military cemetery there with full honours.

The children referred to are Dora and Glyn Baker from the Abergavenny area of south Wales, who were writing a postcard to their father.

But despite identifying the family airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the Baker family to come forward.

Jacqui Mills, airport spokeswoman, said: 'We gained a lot of interest once we went out with the story we had found the bear.

'We had bear historians, photographic historians and ancestral forums come forward to help.

'Using all the information we had we managed to identify the family in the photograph and trace "Daddie" as Nicholas James Baker.

'The only problem we have is that we have not had any living relatives come forward to claim the bear.

'We would love to find them and reunite them with this lovely bear.'

Staff at Bristol Airport spent 14 months trawling flight records to see if they could find any two passengers with the same names as those mentioned on the back of the picture.

When they could not, they appealed for help from the public and a number of experts stepped forward to help with the search.

They were able to trace the date of the picture after they discovered a second message on the image, which said: 'taken on Baby’s birthday March 4th 1918, one year and five-months-old.'

A studio name was also left on the photo and from there experts tracked the picture to Wales and managed to track Dora and Glyn.

But, despite tracing the girls, they have now drawn a blank and are once more calling for help to return the bear - named ‘Bristol’ by staff - to his rightful owner.

Hilary Kaye, BBC Antiques Roadshow expert, said she thought the bear was made by the British manufacturer Farnells, and was the type that inspired the Winnie the Pooh stories.

'It would be a lovely Christmas present if the teddy in the photograph could go back to his rightful family,' Ms Mills said.

Despite identifying the family, airport staff are yet to trace any living relatives and are appealing for anyone who knows the Baker family to come forward

'We honestly, genuinely believed somebody would come forward and claim him.

'A lot of our passengers do go off for one or two months so it’s not unusual to have something in lost property for a while, but then nothing happened.

'We’re appealing for the family to come forward. So many more people study their own history and family trees now.

'We are hoping now, with all this new information we have identifying who these people in the picture were, we will be able to come up with a living relative.'
