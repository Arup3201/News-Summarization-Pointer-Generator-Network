It was an expletive uttered by his new team-mate Thierry Henry that initially made Bojan Krkic aware that another kind of life was possible away from the suffocating madness of Barcelona.

Henry, used to being in the public eye as a French World Cup winner and Arsenal legend, hadn't been at the Nou Camp long before realising the levels of adulation and pressure in Catalonia were on a totally different scale to anywhere else.

'When Thierry came, after 10 days he was like: "F***"' recalls Bojan, whose move from La Liga to Stoke City in the summer transfer window has been one of the most eye-catching transfers of 2014.

The diminutive frontman claims he loves the passion at Barcelona, but prefers life at Stoke

'Thierry said in England it was easy, the people never came to the training ground and the journalists only visited once a week. At Barcelona, there are five thousand people at training every day, television crews filming you every day. It's totally different.'

Furthermore, Henry assured his young colleague that in England, supporters didn't grab at you in the street or travel miles to wait outside your house in the hope of catching a glimpse.

For Bojan, who found it hard to cope with the huge expectations placed on him after eclipsing Lionel Messi as the youngest goalscorer in Barcelona's history aged 17 years, 54 days, the exchanges with Henry were illuminating.

It sowed a seed that maybe there was a future, a more pleasant future, in England. And while he could not have foreseen then that his journey would one day lead to Stoke, a place better-known around the world for pottery than football, he has no regrets.

'I love the passion at Barcelona, I have grown up in a Latin country after all, but I like it better here. In Spain, people do not respect the players, the same as in Italy,' he says.

Bojan burst on to the scene and reminded fans of Messi, which may have worked against him

'In England it looks like a different world, the people admire the players but also respect them. Here is better, more tranquil.'

To outsiders, the transfer of a one-time boy wonder to Stoke appears strange. Four years ago this weekend, he was involved in El Clasico when Barca thrashed Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid 5-0 in what was hailed as the greatest club performance of all-time. This Saturday, he will instead be sharpening his boots for the visit of Burnley at the Britannia.

But scratch the surface and it does make more sense for the 24-year-old to have changed direction in his career as sharply as he turns defenders on the pitch.

The son of a Serbian footballer whose own career ended in Spain, Bojan was inducted into Barcelona's world-famous academy at the age of nine.

His quicksilver feet reminded everyone of Messi – no pressure there, then – and he scored 900 goals at youth level before making his first-team debut at a younger age than the Argentine genius. Comparisons between them reached fever pitch.

'At the time. I thought I didn't feel pressure but when I look back now, I can see it is difficult for a 17-year-old boy to get by and deal with the whole situation,' admits Bojan.

'Everything changed for me overnight. A lot of my friends would still be at school and if I tried to go out with them, it would suddenly be very complicated.

'Fans would run up to me if I'd go through the streets, My family lived in a village rather than the city but supporters would still come to my house. One newspaper portrayed me as a superhero.

'I lost some of my childhood and that is one of the things I am most sensitive about and touched me the most. I am a family person but there were many moments I didn't haven't the chance to enjoy with them, even though I know football has given me other things.'

Bojan makes it clear he is not looking for sympathy or putting out a sob-story. But it's true that everyone is hard-wired differently and while Messi, Andres Iniesta and Xavi coped with being in the spotlight, the softly-spoken Bojan found it difficult.

- Makes his Barca debut in a 0-0 draw away to Osasuna in September 2007 less than three weeks after his 17th birthday.

- Takes Lionel Messi's record as the youngest scorer in Barcelona history with a clever right-foot finish against Villarreal at the Nou Camp, aged 17 years, 54 days.

- Replaces Santi Carzola for his Spanish debut at 18 in World Cup qualifier against Armenia. It remains his only Spanish cap but he has played seven times for Catalonia.

- Scores a wonder goal from Xavi's pass in a 4-1 Barca win against Villarreal. Bojan put the ball to the defender's left while he ran around the other side before finishing in the corner

- Sets up the final goal for Jeffren in the best Barcelona performance ever, a 5-0 victory over Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid in El Clasico of November 2010.

- Shows Stoke fans what he can do with an outstanding solo strike at Spurs in their last Premier League match, picking the ball up from near the halfway line and finishing with a 25-yard drive

'I grew up at Barcelona in one of the golden ages with the best players in the world. Every day we learned with the ball, and that was critical.

'But when you play with a big club, you need to get results every single day, even more when you come from the house (homegrown). It's not easy.

'Frank Rijkaard was my first coach in the first-team and I played well and scored. In my second year, they changed the trainers (to Pep Guardiola) and the chances and opportunities were different.'

Rijkaard adored Bojan but under the more intense and demanding Guardiola, the little forward was gradually reduced to the role of bit-part player.

There were dark rumours in Catalonia that Bojan felt he was picked on. It's not something he expands on during this interview but his words do indicate he was an unhappy footballer, eventually leaving on loan to Roma, AC Milan and Ajax between 2011 and May 2014.

Bojan sealed a £3million move to Mark Hughes' side and joined former Barca team-mate Marc Muniesa

'As an only son, it was not easy for my parents to see all the things I was going through (in Barcelona). So eventually I took the decisions I took and I was convinced I was doing the right thing.'

When Stoke City made an inquiry for the fallen idol last summer, their timing was perfect – and Bojan remembered what Henry had told him about England.

Encouraged that his former Barcelona team-mate Marc Muniesa was already at Stoke, he quickly said 'Yes' to manager Mark Hughes, a former striker at the Nou Camp himself.

After his problems with Guardiola, the relationship with Hughes has been key.

'I don't like it when a coach puts up a big distance between himself and the players,' explains Bojan. 'He (Hughes) is very close to us and that's why I like him.

Thierry Henry's words of wisdom about England helped Bojan to make the decision 

'I knew Stoke was a historic club and when I learned Mark wanted me in this team, it was a great motivation.'

Off-the-field, he has settled in well, taking twice-weekly lessons to improve his already-passable English and knowing enough to use country roads from his Cheshire home to training each morning thereby avoiding the busy M6.

Football-wise, it's been more of a slow burner with Hughes asking for patience from Stoke fans. But last weekend, Bojan rolled back the years to score his first goal for the club against Spurs following a brilliant solo run and low finish from 25 yards. It hints at plenty more to come.

'The first few months have been important to improve my physical condition and get used to a new league. But anyone will tell you, the more you play, the better rhythm you find,' he explains.

Hughes' Stoke side find themselves in ninth-place in the Premier League with 15 points from 11 games

'I think I have played well in some games but people will say Spurs was my best match because I scored and we won!

'I don't compare Stoke to Barcelona. Not everybody can say that they have been at Barcelona, but I don't think everyone can say, “I am a professional footballer in the Premier League.”

'English football has changed in the last 10 years, it's not so different now from Spain. If a defender goes in hard, they will be booked or sent off.

'Some of the things I did early in my career might have been forgotten now. But I know how much it cost me and that is why I feel proud. And it gives me the strength to continue. I will work to improve every day. I am only 24 and there is plenty of football ahead.'
