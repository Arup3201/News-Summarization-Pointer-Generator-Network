Lisa Egersdorf is accused of taking her son on a drive-by shooting so he could attack a rival gang

A mother has been accused of driving her son to a convenience store so he could shoot at rival gang members he had been fighting with at school.

Prosecutors said Lisa Egersdorf, 36, picked up her 17-year-old son from his school in Salt Lake City, Utah, and was behind the wheel when he fired several shots at the group.

Egersdorf asked, 'Did you get them?' after he fired six rounds at the group on September 22, charging documents showed.

One of the shots hit a woman's car outside the 7-Eleven store, in the Millcreek area of the city, but no one was injured.

Her son Damian Garcia and his friends got into Egersdorf's Toyota Corolla in the school parking lot after the fight.

Police said that Garcia yelled: 'Mom, they just jumped me.'

She replied: It's all right, we're going to get them.' 

Egersdorf later told investigators that she and her son are part of the same gang, police said.

She accepted that she drove Garcia to the 7-Eleven but denied that the shots came from her car. 

The charges read: 'The next day [the woman] called police at their request and arranged for and [her son] to meet with them.

'[She] claimed that there was another vehicle that she saw fire upon three gang members. When confronted about what witnesses had stated, [she] said, "What am I supposed to do?"' 

Egersdorf was charged with 10 felonies and three counts of reckless endangerment. 

Garcia, who can be named as he is being prosecuted as an adult, was also charged with 10 felonies, including aggravated assault and six counts of firing a gun.

Neither were available for comment.
