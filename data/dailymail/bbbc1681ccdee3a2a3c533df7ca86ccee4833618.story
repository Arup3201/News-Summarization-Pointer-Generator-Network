GK - Eldin Jakupovic (HULL CITY vs Liverpool) - 7

Brought into the Hull side after Steve Harper suffered an injury at Arsenal last week, Jakupovic performed well to earn the Tigers a battling point at Anfield.

The Bosnian wasn't exactly peppered by Liverpool shots but he made no mistakes when called upon, notably saving from Mario Balotelli in the first-half.

DEF - Angel Rangel (SWANSEA CITY vs Leicester City) - 7

The right-back, making his 300th appearance for the Swans, proved influential in an important home win over Leicester.

The Spaniard's most telling contribution came when he fed Wilfried Bony to help create the first of the striker's two goals after 34 minutes.

DEF - Toby Alderweireld (SOUTHAMPTON vs Stoke City) - 7

Southampton's narrow win over Stoke may not have been as impressive as last week's eight-goal demolition of Sunderland, but it was just as important as the Saints moved up to second.

Alderweireld has proved the perfect replacement for Dejan Lovren as their brilliant start under Ronald Koeman continued with another win and clean sheet.

DEF - Brede Hangeland (CRYSTAL PALACE vs West Brom) - 7

The Norwegian has been a bit-part player this season but proved his value by scoring Palace's opening goal in the 2-2 draw at West Brom.

After Hangeland had headed Yannick Bolasie's corner into Craig Dawson, he was alert to prod the rebound into the net.

DEF - Aaron Cresswell (WEST HAM vs Manchester City) - 8

The full-back has adapted to life in the Premier League well since his summer move from Ipswich and he produced another consummate performance here.

The highlight came on 75 minutes when Cresswell advanced down the left and crossed for Diafra Sakho to double the Hammers' advantage.

MID - Mohamed Diame (HULL CITY vs Liverpool) - 8

The Senegal midfielder is in excellent form and scored in last weekend's 2-2 draw at Arsenal. Saturday's performance was less spectacular but Diame's no-compromise approach to midfield play helped Hull to a valuable point at Anfield.

MID - Alex Song (WEST HAM vs Manchester City) - 8

Song seems to grow more commanding with every game and he controlled the midfield against the champions with another strong display.

His through ball to play in Enner Valencia to set up West Ham's first goal was excellent.

MID - Saido Mane (SOUTHAMPTON vs Stoke City) - 8

Mane had been unlucky to see his first Premier League goal chalked off in Southampton's 8-0 win over Sunderland last week but would not be denied here.

Restored to the starting XI by Ronald Koeman, the Senegal star pounced onto the rebound after Graziano Pelle's shot had ricocheted off the post to settle the contest.

MID - Alexis Sanchez (ARSENAL vs Sunderland) - 8

Sanchez has been consistently excellent this season and he again demonstrated his match-winning qualities as Arsenal won at Sunderland.

His alertness was key, capitalising on two defensive errors - first from Wes Brown and then from goalkeeper Vito Mannone - to get on the scoresheet twice.

FWD - Diafra Sakho (WEST HAM vs Manchester City) - 8

A constant threat to the City defence, Sakho was strong and powerful and continued his excellent recent form with what proved to be the winner.

Cresswell surged down the left and Sakho leapt to beat Joe Hart with a well-placed header - and a little help from the goalline technology.

FWD - Wilfried Bony (SWANSEA vs Leicester City) - 8

Bony finds himself in a rich vein of form and he scored two to settle this one.

He exchanged passes with Gylfi Sigurdsson to score in his third successive match on 34 minutes and then secured the win from Jefferson Montero's pass.
