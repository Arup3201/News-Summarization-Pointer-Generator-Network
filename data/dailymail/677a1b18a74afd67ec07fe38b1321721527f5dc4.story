They spend their days travelling along England's country lanes and their nights in traditional gypsy wagons, moving from campsite to grassy verge as the mood takes them.

But these are not the gypsies of the sort made famous by My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding. Instead, these are the UK's New Age Travellers, a peaceful hippyish community devoted to the principles of New Age belief, which include spiritual healing and a holistic view of the cosmos.

Often hard to find, thanks in no small part to their constant travels, the people of the New Age Traveller community are the subject of a spectacular series of photographs by British snapper, Iain McKell, who spent months living with a community based in the West Country.

Low key: New Age Travellers live a quiet life, roaming the roads of Britain in their elaborately decorated horse-drawn wagons

Travels: The majority of New Age Travellers are to be found in the West Country, in particular Devon and Somerset

Back to nature: New Age Travellers live a simple life, producing their own food and living hand-in-glove with nature

McKell, who has since produced a book on his experiences with the Travellers, has captured a snapshot of their simple life, which sees them spend the majority of their time either on the road or setting up camp in some of the loveliest parts of the English countryside.

Unrelated to the Roma or Irish Travellers, the New Age Traveller movement began in 1986 when a group of post-punk anti-Thatcher protesters headed out of London into the English countryside.

Over the years, the movement has evolved into what McKell describes as 'a hybrid tribe of new gypsies' and 'present-day rural anarchists', who, along with flitting about the countryside, regularly appear at festivals, among them Glastonbury.

Indeed, the earliest years of the 'Horsedrawn', as they're also known, were characterised by mass attendance at festivals such as WOMAD and the Stonehenge Free Festivals, although another, the Castlemorton Common Festival, proved considerably more controversial.

No relation: New Age Travellers like those featured in McKell's book are no relation to either Roma gypsies or Irish Travellers

Community: The New Age Traveller movement began in 1986 when a group of anti-Thatcher post-punk protesters moved to the country

Freedom: The movement grew out of festivals such as the Stonehenge Free Festivals of the 1970s and many still attend Glastonbury

Simple: The majority of New Age Travellers eschew modern creature comforts, although that didn't stop Kate Moss from visiting

Held in 1992 in Somerset, the week-long unlicensed festival attracted an estimated 40,000 ravers but led to the Government taking action on 'illegal' festivals after the event made headlines across the UK.

Despite the banning of unlicensed festivals, life for New Age Travellers remains largely unchanged, with McKell's 'new gypsies' sharing a desire for sustainability, a love of self-reliance, and a disdain for the trappings of contemporary life. 

Although the New Age Travellers aren't immune from the lures of the modern world - among McKell's photos is a snap of Kate Moss enjoying a dose of gypsy life - for most, an existence that eschews traditional creature comforts for the simplicity of life on the road remains the ultimate goal.
