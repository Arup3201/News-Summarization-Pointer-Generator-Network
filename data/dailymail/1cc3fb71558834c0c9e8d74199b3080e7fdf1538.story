Police cars were spotted arriving at Tulisa Contostavlos's house today just hours after she was exposed as an alleged drug fixer and was caught arranging an £800 cocaine deal through a friend.

An undercover reporter from The Sun 
newspaper revealed the scandal and unveiled how she helped arrange the 
drug deal through introduction.

The publication also revealed it had handed over a dossier of information on the scandal to the Metropolitan police - and this morning a police car was seen turning up to the singer's home.

Probe: Referring to grams of cocaine as 'white sweets', she is said to have given out a mobile number for her friend - a rapper known as Mike GLC (pictured) - who later allegedly sold journalists £800 of cocaine

Holiday: Tulisa and Mike GLC leaving Marbella last week

The report claimed that the former X Factor judge even boasted 
to a tabloid reporter about her links to drugs and claimed to be able to
 get hold of 'whatever you want'.

During
 one meeting with the reporter, Tulisa told him: 'Half my phone book 
sells it. Of course I can get it for you. Half the guys I know are drug 
dealers.'

The N-Dubz star also revealed her best friend is a 'massive cocaine dealer'.

And
 that brag was proved correct when her pal - Mike GLC - allegedly sold 
£800 worth of the Class A drug to the undercover reporter after Tulisa 
had sent text messages to him to sort the deal out.

During an evening out with the 
undercover reporter from The Sun, the singer was asked if she could hold
 of some cocaine, to which she replied 'yes, definitely'.

She then gave him a number and gave the reporter instructions to call him and say he was her friend and he 'will sort you out'.

The
 reporter then spoke to Mike, who said he only supplied wholesale 
quantities of the drug and eventually agreed to sell half an ounce for 
£800, with an added £20 for delivery costs.

Best friends: Mike was recently spotted partying with Tulisa as they jetted off to Marbella together

In pictures revealed in The Sun he is
 then seen handing over a plastic bag of white powder during their 
arranged meeting at The Dorchester Hotel in London.

Mike was recently spotted partying with Tulisa as they jetted off to Marbella together.

Tulisa,
 who has previously claimed she turned her back on drugs when she was 
14, also revealed during one chat that she has developed a special 
'lingo' for when she wants to arrange narcotics.

She revealed that she refers to drugs
 as 'sweets' - with 'green sweets' meaning cannabis and 'white sweets' 
referring to cocaine.

Although
 she did reveal that she doesn't take cocaine herself, although later 
freely admitted that she loves to smoke weed to help her fall asleep 
every night.

And she also boasted of her previous drug dealer roots.

Tulisa revealed that she used to deal drugs when she was young because 'she was pretty and female, no one suspected me'.

She also used to date a drug dealer when she was 16 and would hide his drugs in lottery tickets.

The singer, who recently left The X Factor line-up, has previously revealed all about her troubles growing up.

But
 in recent years she has made an effort to reinvent her image to make 
herself a good role model for her millions of young fans.

In
 her autobiography, she said: 'Why am I a role model? Because I have 
been myself. I'm an inspiration for Broken Britain. I didn't want to be 
seen as a negative role model for young kids. I felt like I had a 
responsibility to behave in a certain way.'

A
 spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: 'We have received 
information concerning the alleged supply of illegal drugs at a central 
London location. We are considering the information.'

A representative for Tulisa declined to comment when contacted by the MailOnline.
