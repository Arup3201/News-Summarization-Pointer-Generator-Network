A dentist is fighting for her life today after she plunged 30ft from a window to escape a fire only to miss a duvet held out to cushion her fall.

Three men had held the duvet out in an attempt to catch Pirkko Pellinen as she leapt from her second-floor bedroom.

But she missed it and landed feet first in an alleyway.

The fire had broken out in the 
66-year-old’s wooden-framed house close to the seafront in Hastings, 
East Sussex, and ripped through the building.

More than 200 people were evacuated from the area as 48 firefighters tackled the blaze at 12.30am on Sunday.

Acrid black smoke poured out of the building and eye witnesses described flames 50ft high coming out of the roof.

The
 blaze gutted Miss Pellinen's four-storey home and severely damaged 
several adjoining homes and businesses in the seaside resort.

Devastation: The aftermath of yesterday's fire in Hastings, where a woman was badly hurt when she leapt from a second-storey window when she became trapped inside her wood-framed  home by the flames

Miss
 Pellinen, from Finland, has lived in the UK for more than 20 years and 
works at a dental practice in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex.

Today, she was still in a critical condition in Royal County Hospital in Brighton, police said.

Her long-term partner Alan Toole was 
by her side. He recently opened a bicycle repair shop called Epicycle in
 Hastings around 100 yards from the fire.

Bookshop
 owner Graham Frost, 69, said: 'The fire started about 12.30am. They had
 knotted bed sheets together right down to the floor to climb down and 
escape.

'Three of them then 
held a duvet and told Pirkko to jump but she missed and fell straight 
down. She was in a bad way, she was unconscious.

'They
 dragged her out of the alleyway because bits were falling from the 
building. The ambulance was called and the fire brigade. They took about
 20 minutes to get here.'

Police
 were guarding the scene yesterday, which was sealed off to the public. 
Fire officers and structural engineers were investigating amid concern 
that the row of buildings may collapse.

Fighting for her life: Miss Pellinen, from Finland, has lived in the UK for more than 20 years

Sussex
 Police have appealed for witnesses to come forward, as 35 people were 
forced to leave their homes and seek temporary accommodation.

Eye-witnesses described huge flames from the roaring fire.

Harry Hunt, 21, said: 'I was at a friend’s birthday party close by and we saw the smoke coming down the street.

'I
 saw the poor woman jump out of the window from one of the burning 
buildings. She fell down the alleyway and was carried away by 
firefighters. Seeing her jump was quite disturbing.'

Eye-witnesses described huge flames from the roaring fire

Martin Adams, 41, said: 'The woman jumped straight into the alleyway. They had put a duvet out but she missed it.

'The
 whole street was full of smoke and glowing embers in the air. When I 
saw it I thought of Pudding Lane and the fire of London.

'All
 the houses are really old and packed in all together. The firefighters 
were concentrating their jets on the alleyway to stop it spreading.

'The flames were at least 50ft height from the top of the building.'

The fire has left 35 people needing temporary accommodation.

Evacuee
 Joy Gillham, 73, said: 'I heard shouting and banging at 1am and looked 
out of the window onto George Street and saw ambulances and a lot of 
people standing around.

'I saw the flames on the roofs of the buildings from my bathroom window. The damage caused was quite intensive.

'I
 was one of the residents who were evacuated to the East Hastings Sea 
Angling Association but because all of this happened completely out of 
the blue it was very disorganised. I ended up staying overnight at my 
daughter’s house in Battle.

'I
 was completely petrified when I had to be evacuated as they 
(firefighters) told me this building could catch fire as well if the 
wind had changed direction.

'I
 kept seeing the fire coming closer to my house. The walls have laden 
plaster and the houses here date from the 1830s so my house could have 
gone up like a tinderbox.'
