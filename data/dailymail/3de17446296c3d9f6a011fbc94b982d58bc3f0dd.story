Notoriously angry actor Alec Baldwin is not apologizing over an incident that led to a disorderly conduct arrest in May.

Baldwin told a Manhattan judge Thursday he'd rather pay a fine than say sorry over the encounter that started when police stopped him for riding a bicycle the wrong way down a one-way street.

To a packed courtroom, a clearly amused Judge John Delury asked the actor, 'Can you stay out of trouble, Alexander?'

Date in court: Alec Baldwin leaving his home on Thusday morning for his scheduled court appearance for riding his bicycle the wrong way up Fifth Avenue in May 

A rather sheepish Baldwin replied, 'Sure, sure.' The judge then gave him an adjournment in contemplation of dismissal.

'Be a good boy from now on,' Delury bantered. 'Have a good day.'

Prior to his the two traded friendly verbal blows as Baldwin's latest courtroom appearance went off smoothly.

'You were in the ‘Search for Red October’?' the judge asked according to the New York Daily News.

'No, ‘Hunt for Red October,’ Baldwin corrected him.

'That’s a good movie,' commented Delury as he surveyed the charges. 'Looks like you have a short fuse.'

Baldwin said he wanted to pay a fine and Delury replied, 'I'm asking for an apology.'

'I'd rather pay a fine,' retorted Baldwin.

Taken away in handcuffs: Alec Baldwin was detained by officers in New York in May and taken away in a cop car

Volatile: The volatile actor reportedly 'went ballistic' on cops during the incident which led to him being led away by cops

Delury ordered an adjournment for Baldwin for the actor's latest public spat when he was arrested by a pair of women city cops after riding the wrong way up Fifth Avenue on May 13.

The volatile actor was handcuffed by police officers and taken away in a squad car, with one witness telling In Touch he 'went ballistic on the cops, screaming at them' during the incident which led to his arrest.

He was asked to provide ID which he didn't have on him. Officers said that he then started to argue with them and was taken into custody.

A source told the New York Daily News he became enraged because the young police officers failed to recognize him.

According to the insider, Alec said: 'How old are these officers? They don't even know who I am.'

Sombre: Alec looked downcast as he left the precinct and made his way home after his chastening arrest in May

Sullen: Baldwin refused to comment as he arrived home that day but it didn't take him long to start tweeting about the incident

Hitting out: Alec took to Twitter as soon as he got back to his New York apartment to tell his side of the story

A police source added to the publication: 'He became belligerent, yelling and screaming at the officers, 'I don't have ID. Just give me the f***ing summonses.'

Although Alec argued with officers, by the time he was cuffed he was 'calm and quiet', an onlooker told In Touch.

In a fit of rage in the hours after he was released by police that afternoon, the 30 Rock star returned home to take to Twitter and launch one of his now-famous rants.

The star, who was once tipped to run for Mayor of New York, wrote: 'New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.'

Recent appearance: Alec Baldwin and his wife Hilaria Baldwin at the opening night of 'Clever Little Lies' in New York on July 19

In February Baldwin threatened to leave New York because he wanted privacy.

He told New York magazine he would 'probably' have to pack his bags and bid farewell to his beloved hometown sooner rather than later.

He talked about beginning to 'crave' Los Angeles after over 30 years in the Big Apple because he thinks he would be able to give wife Hilaria and their nine-month-old daughter Carmen a more peaceful and private life.

However, despite his demands for privacy, he often poses for his wife's public Instagram page, where she shares intimate family moments.

Meanwhile, Alec has faced controversy in the past few years for repeatedly being accused of using homophobic slurs.

In November his newly-launched cable show was pulled off the air  after the actor was caught calling a photographer a 'c***sucking f**'.

It came after a rough week for Baldwin, as he appeared in court for the trial of his stalker and then got in at least four arguments with journalists and photographers in front of his Manhattan apartment in the following days. As the suspension was announced, Baldwin even threatened to quit showbiz for good.

'If quitting the television business, the movie business, the theater, any component of entertainment, is necessary in order to bring safety and peace to my family, then that is an easy choice,' he wrote in a blog post on the Huffington Post.
