This is the shocking arsenal of kitchen knives used by a teenage gang to hack a teenager to death at Victoria Station.

The horrific haul, revealed in images released by police, includes a Samurai sword, and shows one knife so long it can barely be concealed in a newspaper.

Another spans the width of the schoolbag it was hidden in after the deadly attack on 15-year-old Sofyen Belamouadden

It comes as new CCTV footage has been released showing the moment the 20-strong gang swooped on their victim, a promising young footballer.

Police
issued the video reels of the moments before the stabbing of Sofyen as a
leading detective in the case pointed part of the blame for the attack 
on violent computer games.

The
15-year-old had his life cut short at Victoria station in central 
London when he was chased and killed by the gang of youths.

Detective
Chief Inspector John McFarlane yesterday blamed the 'blitz attack' on 
Facebook and Blackberry's messenger service which allowed his killers to
organise themselves.

He said the teenagers had lost touch with reality because of 
violent computer games.

He told the Times: 'You've got people 
playing computer games where they're shooting and stabbing people. Where
is the real world for them? There is a blurring between the real world 
and this false computer world.'

Bayode,
of Streatham, south London, became the 17th person to be convicted of 
involvement when he was found guilty at the Old Bailey in October of 
manslaughter and conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. The jury 
could not reach a verdict on murder.

Twenty teenagers were charged in 
connection with the attack, but three were cleared. Fifteen others have 
already been jailed for a total of 129 years.

Obi Nwokeh, 20, Christopher Omoregrie 
and Samson Odegbune, both 19, were given life sentences for murder last 
April with minimum terms of 18 years.

Victoria Osoteku, 20, the only female to be charged, was jailed for 12 years for manslaughter, along with three other youths.

Horrific: Judge Christopher Moss told the court that the 'ferocious and merciless attack' took place in front of horrified commuters at Victoria station

She was seen on CCTV kicking Sofyen in
the head as he lay dying on the ground after the 12-second attack and 
also helped with buying the knives that were used in the fatal assault.

Sofyen was stabbed nine times in the body and suffered wounds to his heart, a lung and major blood vessels.

The victim had dreamed of playing football for England and his death has left his family devastated.

The
attack was the horrific end of a minor confrontation the day before in 
the fast-food area of Victoria mainline station between pupils from the 
two schools, in which a youth received a bloodied nose.

Messages were sent by phone and on Facebook arranging the clash.

Sofyen died after being chased by about 20 pupils across the Terminus Way concourse and into the Underground station.

A
youth led the charge with a Samurai sword. Others were armed with a 
flick knife and a Swiss army knife, machetes and screwdrivers.

Sofyen fell down the stairs into the ticket hall and was attacked on the ground by a smaller group.

A
spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'We are accepting the
decision of the Appeal Court and await the sentencing of the final 
defendant.'
