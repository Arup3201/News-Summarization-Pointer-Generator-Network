A photographer has taken the theory that pets look like their owners to its logical conclusion with this set of unusual hybrid portraits.

Canadian photographer Zach Rose has shown just how similar animals and humans can be with his pet project Petheadz.

Starting with his roommates and their cats, Zach has now snapped dozens of owners' faces with their beloved pets' faces imposed on top.

Hug a hoodie: An adorable French bulldog looks totally at home in his owner's slouchy red jumper

Fetch: A border collie (and his owner)
tackle a large stick

Fancy tricks: This acrobatic labradoodle managed to pull off an impressive handstand - with a little help from its owner

Cute couple: A handsome English pointer posing with his girlfriend

He photographs the whole image 
using his iPhone in front of the camera, to create a picture within a picture effect.

Not only do the adorable pets look like their owners, but they also appear to have taken on the same interests and characteristics.

Cats and dogs 
got acrobatic doing a handstand, cradled a baby, and poured themselves a chocolate
milkshake.

Zach has posted the amusing results from all the pets he has met in his hometown of Toronto to his Instagram profile, where the images have received thousands of likes.

Romantic: This alsatian shakes off the breed's aggressive image with a bouquet of carnations

Chic: Another alsatian in a monochrome picture, walking away in his suit

Deep in thought: A sophisticated-looking French bulldog holds his head up high

Off to work: Rather worryingly a mongrel appears to be wielding an axe, hopefully for chopping logs

Zach, who is usually a wedding photographer, meets his subjects before the portrait to get a feel for the owners' and animals' personalities, so that he can match them perfectly.

The project is still ongoing, with a lengthy waiting list.

Animals and humans have never been so in sync.

Playful: Kitty gets its claws out for its elegant black and white portrait

Ponderous: A border collie, sporting a neckerchief, tilts his head to the side

Responsible: A confused mongrel is left holding the baby

Trendy: The hybrid portraits of the pets and their owners, like this woman and her toy dog, have won thousands of fans on Instagram
