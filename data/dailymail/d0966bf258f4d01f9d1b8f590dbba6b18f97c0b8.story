When BethAnn Goldberg left her job as an engineer at Nasa, she didn't want her keen eye for detail to go to waste.

So the mother-of-two from California, USA, started experimenting in her kitchen - and ended up crafting spectacular cakes which are out of this world.

The ultra-realistic creations, which can take days to make, include the likes of muddy trainers, record decks, rusty cars - and even a replica of the Disney character Wall-E.

What a snap! This realistic-looking Canon camera is just one of Ms Goldberg's incredible creations, which can each take days to craft and perfect

Piece of cake? Ms Goldberg started making cakes after leaving her job as an engineer at Nasa to have her first child - now she makes the amazing cakes full-time

The 41-year-old, who has a masters in engineering, made her first cake - a 3D caterpillar - for fun to celebrate her daughter's first birthday.

But after impressing her family and friends with her incredible creation, Ms Goldberg now works full-time bringing amazing scenes to life using icing and sponge.

And Ms Goldberg, who outgrew her kitchen and now works from a studio, says her Nasa background is to thank for the intricate detail which is a trademark of all her cakes.

She said: 'NASA taught me about passion and dedication - I met the most innovative and creative people there who didn't have big budgets or fancy labs but had the dedication and grit to learn and understand.

'I learned natural problems had natural and graceful solutions. Cake design is not a dramatic change in my mind it's just applying the methodology I soaked up from a wonderful institution to another medium. 

'I'm passionate about problem solving and I adore cakes - completely logical step in my mind.'

Labour of love: Ms Goldberg credits her background as a Nasa engineer for her attention to detail, shown in this rusty car cake, which includes nuts, bolts and a crane

She went on to start making a range of personalised cakes, including this record player, and had to move to a studio when the requests started flooding in

It's not what it looks like! This amazing sushi cake might include wasabi, pickled ginger, chopsticks and even soy sauce, but it is crafted entirely from sponge and icing

The mother-of-two says cake design is not a dramatic change from her previous job, as cake-making involves applying the 'same methodology' that she learned at Nasa 

The cakes, which start at around £250, include a range of 3D cars which boast the same features found on a real car model

Nothing is too difficult or time-consuming for Ms Goldberg, as this intricate Scrabble game cake - complete with all the Scrabble pieces and their scores - proves
