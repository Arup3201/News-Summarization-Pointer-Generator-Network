They might be three points clear at the top of Serie A, but Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri is planning further improvements to his attacking forces.

Allegri is sizing up Paris Saint-Germain striker Edinson Cavani, according to Corriere dello Sport, although the paper also reports that any deal is only possible if a big money offer comes in for Paul Pogba.

And according to Tuttosport, Real Madrid could do exactly that. It also reports that Allegri would use the fee to bolster numerous positions in the Juventus squad, but that Pogba is not desperate to leave the Italian champions.

Elsewhere in Italy, La Gazzetta dello Sport leads with AC Milan's 2-1 win over Sassuolo to advance to the quarter-finals of the Italian Cup.

Giampaolo Pazzini opened the scoring for Milan, but could be set to depart with Allegri also eyeing the striker joining his Juventus team.

The paper is another to report that Cavani will be targeted by Juve if Pogba exits.

In Spain, Marca previews the preparation of Carlo Ancelotti's Madrid team as they look to overturn a two-goal deficit from the 2-0 Copa del Rey first leg defeat to Atletico Madrid.

Real playmaker Toni Kroos is quoted on the front page saying 'the task won't be easy, but we are going to try.'

Sport, meanwhile, emphatically quashes rumours that Lionel Messi could leave Barcelona, describing any potential deal to any club in the world as 'impossible'.

Sport says a transfer would cost 500 million euros, leaving any club in breach of Financial Fair Play while adding neither Barcelona or Messi desire a parting of the ways.

In Portugal, Record reports that Benfica are weighing up a possible transfer offer for Ghana midfielder Bernard of Vitoria Guimaraes.

A Bola has a different story about Benfica, saying that Sporting Lisbon's latest young prospect, midfielder Tobias, was rejected by the club when he was only 11.
