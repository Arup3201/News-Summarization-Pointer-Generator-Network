A nine-year-old boy has been given a new pair of ears – made from his ribs.

Kieran Sorkin was teased at school after being born deaf and with nothing but small lobes where his ears should have been.

He ‘always wanted big ears’ and now surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital have granted his wish.

Before and after: Keiran Sorkin was born deaf and without ears but surgeons have gifted him a new pair, sculpted from his rib cartilage

In a six-hour operation they took cartilage from ribs in his chest and sculpted it into a perfect pair of ears.

On seeing the result in a ‘side-selfie’ -a photograph of the side of his head that his parents helped him take - all he could say was ‘Wow’.

Kieran’s father, David Sorkin, said: ‘We’re absolutely on cloud nine. We could not have wished for a better result.

‘They look like normal ears, he had nothing but has got proper sized ears now and they cover the gap where ears should have been. They look normal bar a couple of sewing marks which will go away in time.

‘His reaction was just a “wow”, he is very happy.;

Kieran, of Bushey, in Hertfordshire, was born with a rare condition called bilateral microtia in which the ears are missing or deformed.  Unusually, both of his ears were affected.

He was teased at school and found that other children were more interested in asking about his looks than making friends.

His parents said he wanted to look like everyone and before last Tuesday’s (AUG 5th) operation, he said: ‘I’ve always wanted big ears and now I’m finally going to have them’.

During the op, plastic and reconstructive surgeon Neil Bulstrode, took rib cartilage from both sides of Kieran’s chest and then carved and shaped it into frameworks for Kieran’s ears.

An outline of Mrs Sorkin’s ears served as a template.

The surgeon then grafted the ears onto Kieran’s head under pockets of skin and then used a vacuum to shape the skin to over the contours.

Doing both ears at the same time helped ensure they were a match.

Mr Bulstrode said. ‘This allows us to ensure the ears are balanced and achieve the best result

‘It’s a major operation but it brings a significant improvement in quality of life for children with microtia. Their confidence improves exponentially and their performance at school improves.

‘If you can improve a young person’s confidence, you can alter their whole trajectory in life.’

Mr Sorkin, a 44-year-old IT manager said: ‘It’s been heart-wrenching for us and we’ve had the moral dilemma all along of whether it’s right to change the features that Kieran was born with.

‘But Kieran has talked about having ear surgery ever since the age of six when he saw a TV programme about it.’

The operation was largely cosmetic.

However, thanks to previous surgery and a hearing aid, Kieran can ‘hear the wind blow and the birds tweet’.

He should be able to go back to school after the holidays and bar one follow-up operation in the winter, he should not need any more surgery.

Up to 40 children a year are given new ears at Great Ormond Street, although only five or so will need both ears replaced.
