The head of the professional football players' union Gordon Taylor is a serial gambler who has run up debts of more than £100,000, it has been alleged.

Despite repeatedly warning of the dangers of betting in recent years, Taylor put an estimated £4million on 2,000 bets over the course of 30 months, according to The Sun.

Most of his gambling involved bets on horse racing, but he also spent thousands of pounds betting on Premier League matches.

Claims: Head of the PFA Gordan Taylor has spent millions on gambling, it is alleged

Taylor, who has previously called for a 'zero tolerance' approach to footballers' gambling, is said to have lost £15,000 when England failed to beat Switzerland in 2011.

The 68-year-old has been chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), based in Manchester, for more than 30 years and is reputed to be the highest paid union official in the world on a salary of more than £1million a year.

Taylor's horse race betting is said to have seen him run up a debt of more than £100,000 with a firm called Best Bet, according to The Sun.

The telephone betting company, also based in the North West, is not in administration but has since ceased trading.

Taylor has previously talked of a 'zero tolerance' approach to gambling in football, with the intention that footballers should not be allowed to place bets of any kind on matches.

And the union boss has also argued that players must improve their behaviour on and off the field to set a better example to young fans.

In a recent interview with the Daily Mail he said: 'Part of being a professional footballer is to understand that they are considered to be a role model. The football pitch is not an oasis from law and order. With the high profile position the players are in comes an added social responsibility.'

Despite repeated calls from The Sun yesterday, Taylor has refused to comment on the claims. MailOnline was also unable to reach him for comment this morning.

A union worker said Taylor was expected in the office as normal but did not know if he would comment on the allegations.
