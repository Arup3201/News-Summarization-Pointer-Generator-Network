Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest against the police after officers shot a man dead because he threw stones at them.

Residents marched and staged 'die-ins' throughout Pasco, Washington, days after Antonio Zambrano-Montes, an orchard worker who was born in Mexico, was caught on a witness's cellphone being gunned down by officers at a busy intersection.

The 35-year-old's death last Tuesday has sparked outrage across  the United States and Mexico with many claiming he was moving away from cops when he was shot multiple times.

It is the fourth fatal shooting by police in the city in the last six months and has caused heightened tensions within the community.

Shooting: The orchard worker, who was born in Mexico, had allegedly been throwing rocks at police. He is pictured turning to face three armed officers as one holds up a flashlight and two others draw their guns

According to police, he had refused to stop hurling rocks - one of which was 'softball-sized' - at officers, despite having struck two of them. An attempt to Taser the man had apparently failed.

However, multiple witnesses have argued that Zambrano-Montes - who was not armed with either a gun or a knife - was running away from officers and had his back to them when he was killed at 5pm.

On Friday, the man's family filed a $25 million claim  with the city of Pasco. It came as the president of Mexico reiterated his country's condemnation of the violence against a Mexican citizen.

Now, a county coroner in southeastern Washington has declared he will order an inquest into the shooting in a bid to defuse friction within the community. 

Franklin County Coroner Dan Blasdel said his decision to proceed with an inquest - which will be open to the public - is intended to calm 'some of the fears and outrage of the community'.

On Wednesday, around 100 protesters marched outside Pasco City Hall, with some chanting 'It was only a rock,' according to KEPR. Later that day, more demonstrators gathered at the intersection. 

'It's a stressful time for anybody who wears a badge,' said Sgt. Ken Lattin of Kennewick Police, spokesman for a group of outside police agencies investigating the shooting on Tuesday.

Controversy: A meeting is held inside Vinny's Bakery with Pasco police, some family members and community members about the shooting death of Antonio Zambrano-Montes, who was an orchard worker

At a news conference on Friday afternoon, Lattin said members of the public have a right to march peacefully in the town of Pasco, an agricultural city of 68,000 people, 215 miles southeast of Seattle.

He added that they also have the right to express their opinions on social media. However, he said the public needs to be respectful of other points of view and to each other.

He also cautioned against making a decision about the death based purely on the harrowing video, which was filmed on  witness Dario Infante's cellphone and only entered the public domain this week.

'Our constitution allows people to gather and protest. That is perfectly OK,' Lattin said of a march planned for Saturday. 'Be respectful of others, their person, their property.'

The death of Zambrano-Montes is the fourth fatal police shooting since last summer in Pasco. It has sparked protests after witnesses said he was running away when he was shot in a busy intersection.

Witness Ben Patrick told the Tri-City Herald that police fired at the man as his back was turned.

'I really thought they were just going walk up and tackle or Taser him,' he said. 'But they opened fire. His back was turned.'

Patrick's wife, Shannon, also said the man was running away. The shooting happened in front of her young children. 'He turned around to take off running and the cops just shot him,' she said.

Other witnesses heard officers give Zambrano-Montes orders to stop and drop the rock. They said the man refused to listen.

Zambrano-Montes, who was raised in Michoacan, Mexico, has lived for about a decade in Pasco, where more than half of the residents are Hispanic. He died of gunshot wounds to the torso.

Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto on Friday reiterated his country's 'condemnation of the disproportionate use of lethal force' by members of the Pasco police against a Mexican citizen.

'I have directed the secretary of foreign relations to support his family so they feel the backing and support of the government of Mexico, so they don't feel alone and so there is a close monitoring of the investigation into this regrettable and outrageous occurrence,' he said at a gathering of members of the foreign diplomatic corps in Mexico City.

Zambrano-Montes was not armed with either a gun or a knife, Lattin confirmed at the news conference, but whether he had a rock in his hand when he was shot is still under investigation.

Detectives are still gathering dash-cam video, evidence from the scene, citizen video and police equipment and will be interviewing at least 40 witnesses. 

Zambrano-Montes had a run-in with Pasco police early last year, having been arrested for assault after throwing objects at officers and trying to grab an officer's pistol, court records show.

Lattin cautioned the public that the inquiry will take at least weeks and that any decision on whether to bring charges against the three officers involved will be made by the Franklin County prosecutor.

The officers are on paid administrative leave. 'Those three officers are going to have to live by their decisions,' Lattin said. 'Was it right? That will come out later on.'

Franklin County Prosecutor Shawn Sant said it was too early to speculate about what charges potentially could be brought against the officers.

The Pasco police department also is conducting an administrative investigation of the shooting and could punish the officers if they find they disobeyed department procedures of policies.

Local officials have been in contact with state and federal officials, who are observing the local criminal investigation and decide later whether any further action needs to be taken, Lattin said.

Zambrano-Montes' family's $2 million damages claim was filed by his widow and two daughters. It is a precursor to a lawsuit. The city has 60 days to respond.

The group conducting the criminal investigation was formed in 2010 to look at any officer-involved criminal cases. This is the eleventh investigation they have conducted since then, Lattin said.

In three previous fatal police shootings in Pasco, prosecutors cleared officers with the Pasco Police Department and a sheriff's deputy who was working on a regional SWAT team.

One of the three officers involved in Tuesday's shooting was a defendant in a federal civil-rights lawsuit the city settled in 2013 for $100,000, according to court records. The lawsuit claimed Pasco officers were inadequately trained in the use of force and how to respond to street confrontations.

Earlier this week, the ACLU of Washington also issued a statement, calling the incident 'very disturbing.'

The group's executive director, Kathleen Taylor said: 'Fleeing from police and not following an officer's command should not be sufficient for a person to get shot,'

She added deadly force should be used only as a last resort
