Confession: Gordon Thompson - branded a 'cynical coward' in court - was jailed for 11 years six months

The devastation he caused created some of the defining images of last summer’s riots.

And last night Gordon Thompson – branded a ‘cynical coward’ in court – was told he faces a long jail term after he admitted starting the fire which destroyed a historic furniture store.

The 33-year-old had long denied burning down the family-owned House of Reeves shop in the centre of Croydon, south London, during a terrifying night of anarchy.

But the Old Bailey heard that moments before the blaze started, Thompson had been shouting ‘Who’s got a lighter?’ and ‘Let’s torch the place’.

And as images of the inferno he created were being shown on television later the same evening, a witness said he had boasted: ‘It was me – I did that. I burned Reeves Furniture.’

The fire completely destroyed the 150-year-old store and set fire to buildings opposite, infamously forcing Polish shop assistant Monika Konczyk to jump for her life from her upstairs flat into the arms of rescuers – an image seen around the globe

Just two days into Thompson’s trial, as it became clear his numerous criminal actions on the night had all been caught either on CCTV, in mobile phone video footage or in photographs, he suddenly changed his plea.

'Lawless': Thompson joined a masked mob as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser store before he set light to Reeves

The father of two had been planning 
to claim he was bravely trying to stop masked rioters looting the store 
when it burst into flames.

Yesterday,
 however, he pleaded guilty to arson recklessly endangering life and 
burglary. He had already admitted burgling two other shops – Iceland and
 House of Fraser – on the same evening.

Thompson continued denying arson with intent to endanger life and violent disorder, and the jury was directed to find him not guilty on these charges. He will be sentenced in April.

The Old Bailey had been told that Thompson, a painter and decorator from Croydon, ‘ran riot’ through the streets on August 8 last year, a night when it seemed anarchy was spreading unchecked across the country.

First, he joined a masked mob ‘roaming lawlessly’ through the town as it targeted the Iceland shop and House of Fraser department store – where he was caught on camera clutching stolen bottles of alcohol as he helped others prise open security shutters to gain access.

A witness said he helped direct looters inside. He was also seen tipping petrol into the street and trying to ignite it.

Thompson then headed to the Reeves store, which was founded in Croydon in 1867 and had survived two world wars.

Prosecutor Oliver Glasgow said: ‘Quite what it was that first attracted looters to these premises may remain a mystery since, unlike House of Fraser, which was plundered of clothing and jewellery, few of the rioters could have wanted to steal a sofa.

‘It seems the attention this shop received started when one of the mob threw a piece of debris at one of the glass windows.

‘Thereafter others, including this 
defendant, joined in until the window was smashed, torn from its 
housing, and the rioters managed to get inside.’

Thompson
 was one of the first to enter the shop and emerged carrying a laptop, 
causing the crowd to surge forward in search of other valuable goods.

‘That, however, was not an end to the 
matter,’ said Mr Glasgow. ‘Having vandalised and looted the store, the 
defendant was still not satisfied. In an act of cynical cowardice, he 
asked another of the rioters for a lighter and went back to the shop and
 set fire to a sofa inside the shattered window.

'The effect, as anyone would realise 
and as he plainly intended, was catastrophic. The sofa went up in 
flames, as did other pieces of furniture in the showroom, and within 
minutes the inferno was raging out of control.’

The prosecutor said Thompson remained at the scene ‘to watch what he had done’ before the heat and flames drove him away.

‘The
 ensuing fire razed the building,’ Mr Glasgow said. ‘Such was the 
ferocity of the blaze that embers and heat from the flames set fire to 
property on the other side of the road and numerous residents were 
forced to flee their homes for their lives.’

The
 destruction of the House of Reeves was valued at £1million, damage to 
House of Fraser at £105,000, and fire damage to nearby tram lines at 
£330,000.

Thompson was arrested after he was pictured in a newspaper.

Reeves
 is now trading from another store. Owner Maurice Reeves spoke yesterday
 of the misery the fire had caused his  family. ‘It’s been such a 
traumatic time for us,’ he said.

‘The
 building’s been there all my life, I worked in there every day and when
 I go into work now the building’s not there. It’s with tears in my eyes
 when I think about it.’
