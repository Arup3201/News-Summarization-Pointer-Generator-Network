Gifted linguist and pianist Colin Achgill, 18, had been a student at Atlantic College for almost a year

A talented young musician at a prestigious boarding school leapt to his death after his school prom, an inquest has heard. 

Gifted linguist and pianist Colin Achgill, 18, moved from the United States after winning a place at the prestigious Atlantic College on the Welsh coast.

However, an inquest heard how mystery surrounds the reason why he slipped away from his group of school friends after the prom evening and tragically jumped to his death from a sea cliff.

Colin had travelled from Indianapolis to study at the prestigious Atlantic College in Llantwit Major, South Wales, where he stayed as a boarder for almost a year. 

He had previously spent a year studying in China. 

The international private school is housed in the 12th century St. Donat’s Castle, where newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst once entertained Charlie Chaplain, and was founded in 1962 as a liberal worldwide education movement for peace.

An inquest in Cardiff yesterday heard how Spanish and Chinese-speaking student Colin jumped to his death from the cliff tops near the extensive school grounds.

Friends said the popular student disappeared after they returned to their boarding house following a school prom on Saturday March 22.

Schoolfriend Fin Henrik told police Colin had been drinking alcohol before he disappeared around 11pm but didn’t appear drunk.

He said: 'We were all consuming alcohol but I wouldn’t say he was drunk. He seemed his normal happy self.

'I didn’t see him after that and when he didn’t come home for the curfew we all started looking for him.'

A school-wide search was launched by staff before the police were called around 3am.

Fin said he went back out to search for Colin around 6am on the Sunday morning and discovered his discarded black rucksack and iPod on a cliff top coastal path.

He said: 'I spotted Colin’s black rucksack and an iPod placed on top of his bag. I saw a message he had left on the iPod which was on his main screen and had been written at 11.30pm.'

The inquest heard the message Colin left made it clear he wanted to take his own life - but was not read aloud to the inquest.

His body was discovered by coastguards on the rocks below the high sea cliffs where his rucksack was found.

Heartbroken father Dennis said his family had spoken regularly with Colin during the school term and never realised anything was troubling him.

Mr Achgill said: 'I never detected anything was wrong. He was well respected by his peers and enjoyed the academic environment.

'He seemed to thrive. He learned Spanish in six weeks during a Summer immersion course in 2010 and during an academic course in Beijing had learned Mandarin with distinction.

'I was proud to see how well he was doing and I dreamed of even bigger things for him.

'I don’t know or understand what led to this disaster - I wish I did.'

Assistant Coroner Christopher Woolley said the level of alcohol in Colin’s blood was below the legal driving limit and he was 'in full possession of his faculties' when he jumped from the cliff.

He said: 'Colin was a very good student, very well liked, and clearly a very able young man who had achieved a lot already in his life.

'The note he left in his iPod stated clearly and categorically that he wanted to end his own life. 

'His father said: "I don’t know the causes that led to this disaster”, and that must be echoed by everyone who knew him.

'He gave no clues to anyone that he intended this dreadful thing.

'The care at Atlantic College is very good and I am satisfied there were excellent procedures to take care of a student if there were any issues.

'The reason Colin chose to do this must always remain, to a certain extent, a mystery.'

Mr Woolley said Colin’s death would have been 'instantaneous' from the blood loss suffered through the multiple injuries caused by the cliff fall.

Mr Woolley recorded a verdict of suicide.
