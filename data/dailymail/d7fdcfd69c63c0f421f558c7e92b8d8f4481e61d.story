A grieving mom and dad are at the center of a nationwide 'pay-it-forward' movement that has seen complete strangers pay thousands of dollars for each others coffee, gas, or lunch in a chain reaction that has drawn in tens of thousands of people across the country.

Devastated by the death of their eight-year-old boy Jayden from a rare form of cancer last month, Tom and Nicole Lamb decided on the spur of the moment to pay for the customer behind them in the drive through

The gesture was supposed to be a symbolic thank-you to the community of Midland, Michigan for their support following Jayden's premature death on November 27th.

However, once they returned home and posted what they had done onto Facebook, the Lambs were inundated with stories of 'paying-it-forward' gestures from Minneapolis to Seattle and across the Midwest.

Tom and Nicole Lamb with brave Jayden were inspired to begin a 'pay-it-forward' movement after their young boy lost his life at the end of November

'We didn't think we were starting a chain reaction, that's for sure,' said Tom.

However, in the weeks following Jayden's brave passing from cancer over 30,000 people have joined his 'Keep On Truckin' Team Jayden' Facebook page to tell their stories of paying someone else's restaurant bill or giving children's toys to charity.

Indeed, one generous person donated a diamond engagement ring to the Salvation Army in Midland worth $2000 with a simple note attached that read: 'Paying it Forward Jayden Style. God Bless.'

'We were shocked and amazed that someone would do this,' Jayden's father and stepmother, Tom and Nicole Lamb, told Yahoo! Shine in a joint statement. 'We know that this ring, at one point, meant everything to someone. The fact that they would pay it forward with the ring is so amazing.'

Suffering from a rare form of cancer that was attacking his central nervous system - Jayden Lamb's last poignant words to his father struck such a chord that the family felt compelled to give to others

Little Jayden died at Mid-Michigan Medical Center on November 27 after a two-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. He was 8 years old, a third grader at Pine River Elementary School. He would have been 9 on Wednesday, December 12th.

And all over the country, people are committing random acts of kindness in his memory.

His cancer attacked his central nervous system and tens of thousands of people have been inspired by the poignant last words the boy spoke to his father before his death.

'He looked at me right in the eye and he said, 'I'm never going to get married, daddy,' Tom says. 'My heart sunk when he said that. I'm like, 'Why would you say that, buddy?' And he said, 'God needs me more.''

'I miss him so much,' Tom says. 'It's so hard. I just want him back.'

After Jayden's death, the Lamb family coped with their grief by doing little things to help others.

'The 'Pay it Forward Jayden Style' movement actually started the day before the showings of his funeral when we were just getting coffee,' the Lambs told Yahoo! Shine. 'Not knowing the person behind us, we still felt compelled to buy their coffee. It was just a small way for us to say thank you.'

After his funeral on December 1st, the Lamb family made a trip to a local Walmart and decided to pay a total strangers layaway bill.

One generous person donated a diamond engagement ring to the Salvation Army in Midland worth $2000 with a simple note attached that read: 'Paying it Forward Jayden Style. God Bless.'

Strangers inspired by Jayden Lamb have begun posting evidence of others paying for their restaurant bills and tipping staff at Subway $500 onto the Facebook page set up to honor him

On December 9th in Midland, Michigan one stranger paid for another's meal at the Buffalo Wild Wings and tipped the waitress $50

'We told the worker that it had to be for toys and that it had to be in honor of Jayden,' said Tom.

'It is just so amazing to be able to something for someone else.'

Once the Lamb's realised that the 'Pay-it-forward' movement they had created to honor their son was on the way to becoming a nationwide phenomenon, they encourage members of the public to post their stories onto Facebook.

'Even though we are still grieving with the loss of Jayden, this is helping us cope and heal,' his dad and stepmom told Yahoo! Shine.

'We feel so blessed that our community and those outside of our community would do something in Jayden's honor. To have his name and his legacy still be carried out even after he has gained his angel wings in Heaven is so amazing to us.'

The random acts of kindness litter the page, standing out as a testimony to the brave young boys legacy.

'Saturday I had the pleasure of shopping with my daughters and a kind lady approached me in the checkout line. She handed me a gift card and a note:

'Pay it forward, keep on trucking team Jayden',' wrote Carrie Fike on Facebook. 'I was touched to be part of this since I have heard so much about Jayden and his amazing family. Today, I also paid it forward. I hope Jayden can keep touching lives!'

'I finally got the chance to 'Pay it Forward Jayden style',' wrote Troy-Ciera Rill on Tuesday. 'I was sitting in the drive through at McDonalds & bought a $10 gift card for the 2 guys in the car behind me.

The goodwill that the 'pay-it-forward' drive that Jayden's parents inadvertently created has spread to family members across Michigan

Local businesses have taken to providing free breakfasts for local workers inspired by Jayden Lamb's tragic death from cancer

The Lamb's traveled to a local story to pay off $50 on a strangers layaway bill - as they practice 'paying it forward'

Local businesses have held bake sales and toy drives and the Christmas tree at Messiah Lutheran Church where the Lambs are part of the congregation is being named, 'Jayden's Tree.'

'The girl at the drive through was touched & I loved seeing the expression on their faces when she gave it to them! Its such an inspiration that your son has put on people. God Bless & Merry Christmas!'

Tom Lamb has said that knowing he had inspired so many acts of kindness would have made Jayden very happy.

Local businesses have held bake sales and toy drives and the Christmas tree at Messiah Lutheran Church where the Lambs are part of the congregation is being named, 'Jayden's Tree.'

'He is the most loving and caring child that I can ever imagine,' he told Yahoo! Shine. 'Jayden loved to be able to help other people.'

Jayden was never the type of kid to complain,' he added. 'Even when we were stuck in the hospital for a week at St. Jude's getting chemotherapy treatments. He always smiled, because that's who he was.'

Not all the acts of kindness being committed are based around money.

On December 12th in honor of Jayden's birthday - 2,000 people gathered to release Chinese lanterns into the sky for him

After Jayden's death, the Lamb family coped with their grief by doing little things to help others.

On December 5th, the Lamb family, including Jayden's sisters Faith, 12, and Jilliyn, 11, visited Poseyville Cemetery, where Jayden was laid to rest, to pick up litter.

'I think as any normal family would, we have our moments. It is hard to go each day and not feel that enormous hole in our hearts,' the Lambs told Yahoo! Shine.

'We often get choked up at the little things that we know he enjoyed or would enjoy. We have really grown very close as a family over the years that he battled cancer and honestly, we are all trying to hold each other up right now.'

And on December 12th, in a beautiful tribute to what would have been Jayden's 9th birthday, 2,000 people released Chinese lanterns into the sky to 'send a birthday party to heaven' for Jayden.

'We are so appreciative of everyone that they would do it in his honor,' Tom Lamb told Yahoo! Shine.

'We were fearful after he passed, that he would be forgotten. Knowing that this movement has started allows us to know that his name and who he is will not be forgotten. It has restored hope for us, and many people along the way.'

'It doesn't take away the hurt,' he said, 'but it helps to heal.'
