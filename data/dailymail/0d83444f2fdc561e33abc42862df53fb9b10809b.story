The South Africa squad looked in a relaxed mood as the players were put through their  final paces on Friday ahead of the autumn international against Ireland.

The Springboks take on Joseph Schmidt's team at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday evening in their opening fixture of the QBE Series.

The squad appeared in high spirits as coach Heyneke Meyer and his side made their final preparations in Dublin, and there was even time for Eben Etzebeth to enjoy a keep-ups session.

Team: W le Roux; C Hendricks, J Serfontein, J de Villiers (capt), B Habana; H Pollard, F Hougaard; T Mtawarira, B du Plessis, J du Plessis, E Etzebeth, V Matfield, M Coetzee, T Mohoje, D Vermeulen.

Replacements: A Strauss, T Nyakane, C Oosthuizen, B Botha, S Burger, C Reinach, P Lambie, J P Pietersen.

South Africa have plenty of reason to be buoyant. They head into the match against Ireland able to select the same starting XV that beat New Zealand last month - inflicting the All Blacks' first defeat in two years.

'It's only the fifth time in what will be the 34th Test since I was appointed as Springbok coach that we've been able to select an unchanged starting line-up,' Meyer said earlier this week.

'In this day and age, not making changes to teams is pretty much unheard of, but this is a great position we are in.

'However, we need to make it count against a very tough Irish side on Saturday.

'Although we won our last Test, the challenge this week is to make another step up. It's imperative that we improve in all facets of our play.' 

After Ireland, South Africa will go on to play England and Italy before ending their European tour against Wales in Cardiff on November 29.
