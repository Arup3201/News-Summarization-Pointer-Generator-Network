A former British teacher has been jailed for more than three years for a sex attack on a nine-year-old boy on a Caribbean island.

Keen sailor Derek Ide, 67, sexually assaulted the child on board his yacht in Trinidad.

Ide, who was held by the boy's father following the incident before he rang police, could be extradited to the UK to serve his sentence here.

It happened at a Power Boats boat yard in the coastal town of Chaguaramas, in the St George West area of the country, where Ide has 'strong ties'.

Ide pleaded guilty to serious indecency after prosecutors on the tropical island amended the charge from grievous sexual assault.

The ex-teacher, from Southampton, Hampshire, has spent at least half a year in Trinidad for the past eight years, Port of Spain Magistrates Court heard.

He was arrested after the boy told his parents - who are not native to Trinidad - about the assault.

Ide was held by the boy's father, who then contacted police and officers arrested him in April.

During his first court appearance shortly after the offence, Ide cupped his hand over his left ear during the proceedings and sported a black eye.

Ide initially denied grievous sexual assault but changed his plea to guilty to a lesser charge of serious indecency.

Now a magistrate on the tropical island has sentenced him to three years and four months behind bars.

Former tutor: Derek Ide used to be a teacher at Bellemoor High School for Boys, now Upper Shirley School in Southampton

Under Trinidad law, Ide could have faced up to ten years behind bars.

However Maureen Baboolal-Gafoor sentenced him after telling the court children needed protection from sexual predators.

Sean Cazabon, mitigating, said an application will be made to the British High Commission to have him extradited.

The teacher - who was convicted of a similar offence in the UK in 1983 - is willing to receive therapy and counselling when he is deported, he said.

Neighbours near Ide's home in Southampton spoke of their shock at his arrest.

He had taught at the former Bellemoor School in Southampton and was elected president of the Southampton Schools Association in the 1970s.

He was also an active member of the residents association at the block of flats where he lived.

One resident, who asked not to be named, said 'It's a big shock as whenever I saw him he was very nice and polite.

'I haven't seen him for a couple of years, but he owned a boat here and a boat there and used to go to the Caribbean in the winter. He was really into sailing.'
