Croatia’s government has received a controversial proposal  that says a secluded, barren island of rock known as the Naked Island would be the perfect place to put gay tourists.

Goli Otok was used as a penal colony in Communist times and the pitch to transform it into a gay tourism hub is based on its isolated location in the northern Adriatic Sea.

The proposal from an independent think tank says the island – miles away from anywhere – would be the perfect spot for gay tourists because it would give them privacy away from others.

Former political prison: The island in the northern Adriatic Sea was used as a penal colony by the Communists

Still home to a handful of derelict buildings, the uninhabited island was used by the Communists as a political prison when Croatia was part of Yugoslavia.

It housed thousands of prisoners who lived in cramped conditions and were forced into labour and tortured by their captors for opposing communism. Hundreds died before the prison was disbanded.

The proposal to turn Goli Otok into a gay tourism destination was put forward by the Association of Eco and Social Forum of Croatia after Croatia's government solicited potential investment opportunities.

Aljosa Babic, the head of the association, said it would be a welcome way to boost tourism in the region and it would be easy to implement because Goli Otok is property of the Republic of Croatia.

He added cryptically: ‘Because of its past the island could be an attractive destination.’

In response to questions about whether the proposal is homophobic, a spokesman for Zagreb Pride condemned the idea, telling MailOnline Travel: ‘The investor is a local politician from Rijeka that run for public office in many years, but never got elected. We don’t consider his proposal as relevant.’

Mr Babic, who handed the recommendation to tourism minister Darko Lorencin, said the fact that the 1.5-square mile island is not being used is a waste of resources. 

In the document prepared for the tourism ministry the association said that the big advantage of the island was that it was so secluded and had so little to recommend it that not even locals bothered to go there - and that meant it was private.

They wrote: ‘Gay guests could enjoy their time at the island for 24 hours per day without anyone bothering them. It is completely private.’

Croatia places 44th on a list of destinations for gay tourists.

According to the European Gay Tourist Association, gay tourists spend up to £50m on holidays, said Mr Babic.
