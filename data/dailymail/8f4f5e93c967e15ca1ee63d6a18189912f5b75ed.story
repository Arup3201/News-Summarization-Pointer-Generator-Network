The Christian feast of Holy Thursday is a generally somber affair, but  it also carries a daunting, if less religiously significant, challenge for food lovers. What would you have for your Last Supper?

Unsurprisingly, celebrity chefs such as Anthony Bourdain and Donatella Arpaia want more from their final courses than a simple breaking of bread.

Deciding on a final meal has been a long-time game among chefs, though deciding which flavors would be their last has never been easy.

Photographer Melanie Dunae brought the question to the masses with her My Last Supper books, though she provided help from some of the sharpest and most famous knives in the kitchen.

Chefs such as Gordon Ramsay, Bobby Flay and Rachael Ray made choices ranging from cheeseburgers to  pastas to elaborate truffle dishes to Yorkshire pudding.

One thing they'd have in common, however. The meal would probably be pretty good no matter what they decided to cook.

Donatella Arpaia

Donatella Arpaia said that her Last Supper would be handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce

The American Iron Chef judge, 43, would go out after an Italian meal that stayed true to her family's roots.

'I would pick handmade spaghetti with fresh tomato and basil sauce, along with freshly baked focaccia, some thinly sliced prosciutto and burrata,' the chef, who recently opened a pizzeria, told the New York Post. 

'My first taste sense memory when I fell in love with food was spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil one summer in Capri. It was love at first bite, and I want it to be my last bite as well.' 

Mario Batali

Mario Batali would go to Italy for his final meal and set himself a huge feast with bruschetta and other seafood pasta dishes

Batali, 54, would want to return to the Amalfi coast in Italy, and dine on a huge multi-course dinner starting with bruschetta and including a main course of a shrimp and zucchini pasta, scialatielli ai gamberetti.

The feast would also include mussels, sauteed shrimp dishes and limoncello vinaigrette grilled lobster.

However, the former Food Network chef and owner of restaurants around the world would not cook his final meal, preferring to let a local woman prepare his favorite dishes.

Michelle Bernstein

The Miami-based Michelle Bernstein would go for a number of dishes made by her mother before the end, but would start with lemon oysters

Michelle Bernstein, a James Beard award-winning chef who runs two restaurants in Miami, said she would take a particularly long time with her final meal so she could 'slow down and taste every morsel.'

She would start off with a dozen lemon oysters before asparagus on top of her mother's potato pancakes.

The 46-year-old would then pick dishes from her favorite chefs, such as Gary Danko and Alain Ducasse including braised foie gras with truffles and lobster.

Bernstein, who claims a mix of Latin and Jewish heritage, would also eat her mother's lasagna and upside-down pear cake before a range of pastries and her own banana cream pie.

Anthony Bourdain 

Television host Anthony Bourdain has traveled the world but would take his final meal of bone marrow at St John in London

Anthony Bourdain, 58, has probably gained the most fame for his travel show, but still serves as chef-at-large at New York's Brasserie Les Halles. 

He said he would want his final meal to be at St John in London prepared by its chef Fergus Henderson. 

Bourdain, who said he would like to be alone for his last bites before the grave, would not linger at the table, preferring only roast bone marrow with parsley and a caper salad accompanied by some baguette slices.

The well-traveled chef would enjoy his final meal with a Guinness. 

Bobby Flay 

American chef Bobby Flay kept it simple and decided on a 'crunchified' burger with a light draft beer

Though other chefs longed for foreign shores and truffles in their Last Suppers, 50-year-old American chef Bobby Flay would keep it simple with a cheeseburger.

The star of numerous Food Network shows would jazz up his final morsel with chipotle ketchup and  jalapenos, and 'crunchify' it with potato chips on top of the meat.

Though he contended that the beer is not the important part of the meal, Flay said that he would have a light draft such as a Coors.

Desert would be an ice cream sundae with a cherry on top.

Anita Lo

Anita Lo, chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would incorporate both French and Asian cuisines along with sweetbreads and truffles

Anita Lo, the chef of New York City's Annisa, said that her last meal would include her favorite ingredients, sweetbreads and truffles.

She enjoys mixing French and Asian cuisines and would continue doing so up until her final course.

Lo, who has famously competed on both Top Chef and Chopped: All Stars, would also include sushi in her Last Supper.

Maria Loi

Manhattan restaurant owner Maria Loi's last meal would take her back to her homeland of Greece, including a very specific type of oregano

Originally from Greece, Maria Loi would stick with the food she loved in childhood.

'I’d have freshly baked crusty bread with Greek extra virgin olive oil,' she said.

The owner of Loi Estiatorio would mix in feta cheese and a perfectly ripe tomato, though she would need to make a long journey to find the perfect spice.

Loi said that her final meal would require dried Greek oregano, but only from Mount Taygetos, 

Jamie Oliver 

Celebrity chef Jaimie Oliver said that he would have spaghetti all'arrabiata for his final meal, as well as rice pudding 

If he was facing impending death, Englishman Jamie Oliver would turn to his comfort food, spaghetti all’arrabiata with three types of chilies.

Oliver said that he would take the meal at his house in Essex and eat rice pudding with carmelized roast peaches for desert. 

The 39-year-old would wash it all down with a bottle of Hoegaarden beer.

Gordon Ramsay

Gordon Ramsay has been asked about his Last Supper multiple times, most recently saying that he would have roast beef

The Scottish-born chef, famous for ripping apart budding proteges on his shows such as Hell's Kitchen, would settle down for a roast dinner before shuffling off the mortal coil.

The 48-year-old would choose roast beef with Yorkshire pudding and red wine gravy, according to TIME.

He would also listen to the first album of the musicians Keane while eating it in his London home and drinking Bâtard-Montrachet wine.

Ramsay also previously told the Guardian that he would have black Perigord and white Alba truffle with his roast

Desert would be chocolate fondant and white milk ice cream. 

Rachael Ray 

The Food Network's Rachael Ray said that she prefers to think of her meal happening in heaven, and would eat spaghetti aglio e olio with her grandfather 

The star of her own self-titled show, Rachael Ray said that she wouldn't be able to enjoy her last meal. 

However, once she went to the great beyond, Ray said she would like to eat spaghetti aglio e olio with large amounts of anchovies, garlic, parsley, chili and EVOO.

She said her departed grandfather would cook fish with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, wine and lemon.

Ray said she and her grandfather would drink Sicilian wine.
