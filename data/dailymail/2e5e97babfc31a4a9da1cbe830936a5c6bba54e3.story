CLICK HERE to read which players Brendan Rodgers wants to join his Anfield revolution.

Brendan Rodgers will urge Liverpool to shoot their way to the title as he insisted they have the firepower to overturn Manchester City’s goal advantage.

Liverpool will reclaim top spot on Monday if they beat Crystal Palace, but while both Liverpool and City can finish the season with 86 points, the latter’s goal difference (+59) is nine superior.

Liverpool, like City, have scored 96 times this season and Rodgers has faith his side can secure two huge wins against Palace and Newcastle to edge ahead. He concedes Liverpool are second favourites but he is not convinced City will take maximum points from their last two fixtures.

Open the floodgates: Brendan Rodgers wants his side to shoot their way to Premier League glory

SOS SAS: Liverpool's Luis Suarez (L) and Daniel Sturridge are the most feared partnership in the league

‘If there is any team that can score goals and turn it around, it will be us,’ Rodgers said. ‘That will be our aim. We aim to score goals and be defensively strong. I have seen it before. Chelsea beat Wigan 8-0 in the last game of the season (in 2010).

‘I am not paying any disrespect to Newcastle at all — but what we are saying is if there is a team that has shown it can score goals, it is us. ‘We are not a 1-0 team. That is what gives us the chance. It’s the team that scores the goals that will win.’

He added: ‘Manchester City need to win all their games — they will have won five games in a row and have only done that once this season, so it will be a wee bit new for them as well. It is not over by a long way.’

Outscoring City is a romantic notion, but the reality is that Liverpool will need to show great mental strength to get a result at Selhurst Park on Monday evening. Losing to Chelsea was a huge blow and they were dealt another when City clung on for three points at Goodison Park.

‘I just believe that if we can win our two games, then it will go a long way to deciding whether we finish at the top,’ said Rodgers. ‘But the first thing is concentrating on our game, which we have done all season, and that is Crystal Palace.’

Where Eagles dare: Liverpool face Crystal Palace's much improved defence under Tony Pulis

Despite Liverpool’s title bid, Palace manager Tony Pulis insists that Rodgers should not be manager of the season — it should be Hull’s Steve Bruce.

Pulis himself is a contender for the prestigious accolade after guiding Palace to Barclays Premier League survival when they looked certainties to be relegated before his appointment in November.

‘Taking Hull, an unfashionable club, keeping them up and reaching an FA Cup final is fantastic,’ said Pulis.

‘Sometimes it’s the managers who haven’t got the resources but been successful in their own ways.

‘It’s nice to look further than the top of the tree sometimes.’
