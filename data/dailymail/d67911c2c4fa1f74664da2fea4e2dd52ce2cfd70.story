There are two things women are almost guaranteed to wake up with after a night out dancing in high heels: sore feet and at least one twisted ankle.

But did you know you could also wake up with a more toned bottom and slimmer thighs?

For while the effect of high heels on women's bodies is widely thought to be negative - stilettos are known to cause everything from joint problems to bunions - fitness fans are increasingly claiming that they are actually the secret to a sculpted physique.

A tall order: Anna tries out kicks in her heels

There's just one catch: to feel the full benefit, you have to exercise in sky-high shoes.

High-heel workouts are growing in popularity in the U.S. - with classes including 'The Heel Hop Workout' and 'Stiletto Strength', in which women walk, squat and even do sit-ups in heels, on offer in Los Angeles and New York gyms. And now the trend is coming to the UK.

Celebrities here already seem to be getting in on the act - high-heel lover Victoria Beckham recently tweeted a picture of herself in 5in-high stiletto boots walking on a treadmill with a desk attached.

Which is why I find myself - a 45-year-old who gave up high heels 20 years ago (bar the odd, painful wedding reception or girls’ night out) - standing in my local park wearing Lycra leggings, a vest… and red skyscrapers.

Here to teach me the basics of working out in killer heels is British personal trainer Nikki Manashe, who has developed a high-heel workout that claims to tone legs, bottoms, hips, thighs and core abdominal muscles in ways they’ve never been toned before.

Shape up: Squats like these in heels are said to tone up the legs and bottom

London-based Nikki, 29, began devising the routine 18 months ago while trying out a range of fitness DVDs, including one based on pole dancing in which participants wore heels.

'This particular workout required you to do squats and lunges while wearing them,' remembers Nikki. 'I had never felt my leg muscles work so hard.

'It instinctively made sense to me. The best workout is done on a hill because doing lower body moves with the ankles lifted slightly higher make the calf, hip and leg muscles work much harder.

'Wearing heels at least 3in high means anything you do that works the lower body is not only more effective, it works the smaller muscles, too.

'You discover soreness in areas that you don't when you’re wearing trainers, especially the bottom muscles, the calves, inner thighs and outer hips.'

According to Nikki, the results have been astounding. After 12 months of doing this workout three times a week, her clients have narrower hips, tighter bottoms - and no broken ankles.

Yet can this way of exercising really be sensible?

After all, podiatrists have been preaching the evils of heels for years, warning that they shorten the Achilles tendon in the ankle and put pressure on discs in the spine by forcing wearers to push their hips forward for balance.

Personal trainer Nikki Manashe shows Anna how the workout is done

Last year, the College of Podiatry found that one in ten British women had joint problems, arthritis and muscular issues, and more than half had bunions, as a result of walking in high heels.

Despite all this, the prospect of looking great in skinny jeans is tempting - hence my appointment with Nikki. Thankfully, the first thing she does is make me change back into my trainers for a 20-minute run.

'Running in heels is just downright silly, as the risk of falling over and jarring the joints is so high,' she tells me. But as soon as the run is over, it's high-heel time. I pull them on and, feeling rather silly, start three sets of  20 squats.

Squat exercises are tough enough in functional footwear: with your legs apart, you lower your bottom on to an imaginary seat using all the strength you can muster.

With three inches from the heels added to my 5ft 3in frame, I have to lower my bottom further, which works my calves and hips so hard they burn. I’m pouring with sweat by the end of the third set.

I include squats in my daily workout and usually find them perfectly manageable - but these ones hurt in whole new areas, most notably my inner thighs.

'Right, kick-boxing next,' shouts Nikki, pulling out a pair of sparring pads from her bag of props.

'What, in heels?' I ask. Can she be serious?

Oh yes. I have to get into fighting stance and kick my back foot forward to various heights, hitting the pad with the side of my calf. Double ouch. To balance requires a laser-like focus, which means I can think of little else but staying on my feet - and how much my tummy muscles are hurting.

We move on to walking lunges with bicep curls - putting one stilettoed foot in front of the other and lowering my body weight almost to the ground before lifting the back foot up and doing it again, curling my arms at the same time - for 100 metres. By the halfway point I'm gasping for breath, my bottom and leg muscles crying  for mercy.

We're also getting stares from passers-by: working out in heels isn't for the shy and retiring. Yet when a truck goes by with a catchy song blaring from its open windows, I break into a dance - normally reserved for wedding receptions - and begin joyously waving splayed arms about, shaking  my booty and doing my best mum-dancing.

Suddenly, I feel 25 and sexy again. It's as if I've had a glimpse of the reckless young woman I used to be, teetering in my thigh-high stilettoed boots on the dance floor or strutting across town in bright-red patent Mary Janes, and loving the powerfully sexy feeling it gives me.

'High heels make you feel sexy and more confident,' says Nikki.

'For clients who hate working out, it's a great way of forgetting they’re trying to get fit and making the workout more fun.

'And exercising in heels can make you feel more comfortable in them on nights out.'

Word of warning: Physios warn that exercising in heels can cause damage to the joints

The next day, I can hardly walk and my inner and outer thighs are so sore that just sitting down causes moans of agony.

But it's the good pain that a tough workout can bring, and makes me wonder if I should pop on some heels while using my favourite workout DVDs.

However, physiotherapist Tim Allardyce has some words of warning: 'Working out in high heels is absolutely crazy and completely ridiculous.

'You're increasing the stress through your legs because you're working out with your feet in an abnormal position. Most of the force is going into the big toe, which can lead to bunions.'

It can also damage joints, he says. 'If you work out wearing heels instead of trainers, the foot doesn't adequately absorb the force of movements such as lunges and squats. That force has to go somewhere, so it adds unhealthy pressure to the knees, the hips, the ankles and back.'

This can also increase the risk of back pain, injury and inflammation, he warns.

'The lower back is under so much pressure in heels because all your weight is shifted forwards. That means the discs in the lower spine are at greater risk of becoming stiff and inflamed, and this could lead to serious back injuries such as prolapsed disc where a spinal disc presses against a nerve root in the back causing severe pain.'

So is there any merit in high-heeled workouts?

'I can see how it can strengthen the calf muscles because the calves have to work harder with the ankle on an incline,' admits Tim.

'It can also potentially improve balance because there is less contact with the ground, so other muscles are forced to work harder to keep you upright and stabilise your body.

'In fact, every muscle in the leg will work harder if you're wearing high heels.

'But there are much better and safer ways to strengthen leg muscles - starting with good supportive trainers.'

Maybe I won't be throwing my stilettos into my gym bag just yet. But I might make the effort to go out dancing with the girls again - my thighs will thank me for it.
