The Japanese national  who was killed in a shark attack while surfing near Ballina on the New South Wales north coast has been named as 41-year-old Tadashi Nakahara.

The surfboard technician, was reportedly sitting on his board just 10m from shore at popular surfing spot Shelley Beach near four other surfers  when the shark - believed to be a four-metre great white - attacked just before 10am on Monday.

Speaking to Daily Mail Australia, a worker from the Australian Hotel in Ballina said the man worked at Websters Surfboards on the outskirts of the city and was an avid surfer.

41-year-old Japanese national Tadashi Nakahara (pictured left) died after being attacked by a shark in Ballina

The victim lost both his legs and the other surfers brought him to shore where they attempted to tend to his injuries, but he lost too much blood and was pronounced dead at the scene.  

Mr Nakahara was from Japan but had been living in the area for a number of years. He has been formally identified and police are working with the Japanese consulate to inform his family of his death.

Authorities are searching for the shark using helicopters, rescue boats and jet skis.

Detective Inspector Cameron Lindsay said a witness had been filming the beach at the time but said the footage appeared to have been taken after the attack.

'At this stage we don’t believe we have video of the actual attack,' Det Insp Lindsay said.

'What it appears to capture is a large amount of blood in the water.'

Friends of the man told local cafe owner, Karen, the shark came out from nowhere.

'It just came up between a bunch of surfers,' she told AAP on Monday.

'They weren't even that far out.

'He lost both his legs.'

The victim's friends were shaken up and looked 'white as a ghost' as they carried their mate's board away from the beach, the local said.

Ballina Shire Mayor David Wright said it was believed to be a four metre great white shark that attacked the man.

Authorities kept swimmers and surfers out of the water after today's fatal attack by a shark, which severed both of the man's legs 

'It came up and took the back of the board and part of the gentlemen too, there are not many sharks that can do that,' Cr Wright told Daily Mail Australia.

Police said a shark expert would assist police in confirming the type of shark, if it is likely to still be in the area and if it still poses a threat to humans. 

Cr Wright said authorities believed it could be the same shark that attacked a surfer at nearby Seven Mile Beach yesterday.

'Now the sharks had two bites, if it's the same one, we certainly have to keep our eyes on it,' he said.

Cr Wright said surf life saving helicopters, jet skis and boats were now searching for the great white.

'It's a pretty big shark so it's most likely gone,' he said.

Paramedics at Shelly Beach attempted to revive the man following the attack just before 10am on Monday but he was pronounced dead at the scene 

Three other surfers pulled the victim out of the water following the attack just before 10am on Monday and said the shark was about four metres long, the Ballina Shire Advocate reported.

'The people who pulled him out weren't all that old so we're trying to get some counselling for them,' Cr Wright said.  

A 15km stretch of beach from Lennox Head to South Ballina has been closed to the public.

NSW Life Saving Manager Andy Kent said lifeguards had been stationed at all beaches in the Ballina Shire to keep the public informed and out of the water.

'This is obviously a very serious incident and we would ask that the public follow the directions of emergency service workers and lifeguards by remaining clear of the water,' Mr Kent said.

'Our thoughts go out to the man's family and friends, who are dealing with this tragedy.'

The man's death brings the number of shark attacks to six in the past year and four in the past five months in Australia.

There have been 174 fatal shark attacks in the past 100 years and 809 attacks reported.

The beach will stay closed until authorities decide it is safe for swimmers to return to the water

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman suffered back lacerations and received stitches at Gold Coast University Hospital

This comes a day after a surfer was injured in a shark attack at nearby Seven Mile Beach when he mistook the creature for a dolphin.

Father-of-one Jabez Reitman, 35, suffered back lacerations and was rushed to Gold Coast University Hospital from Seven Mile Beach in Broken Head, south of Byron Bay on New South Wales' north coast.

Mr Reitman claims the shark was two to three metres long.

The Byron Bay man says he panicked when he realised he was hurt as he had been completely unaware a shark was nearby, according to Seven News.

'I just freaked out you know, I thought it was a dolphin at first, until it (his back) started stinging,' he told Seven.

'I didn't realise that there are some pretty bad lacerations.'

The keen swimmer says he is not deterred by the suspected shark attack and is keenly awaiting his return to the water.
