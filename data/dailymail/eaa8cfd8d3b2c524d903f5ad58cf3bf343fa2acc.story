Legend: Lollobrigida was once dubbed 'the most beautiful woman in the world'

Sixties screen siren Gina Lollobrigida has won a bitter legal tussle with her son over her vast fortune.

Only
 son and heir Andrea Mirko Skofic had wanted to wrest control of her 
estimated £30 million estate from the 87-year-old actress, claiming she 
had fallen under the sway of several young male admirers.

Last
 year the screen goddess once dubbed 'The Most Beautiful Woman in the 
World' took legal action against her former toyboy lover over claims he 
married her by proxy without her knowledge to get his hands on her 
money.

Mr Skofic had asked 
for her estate, including properties in Italy and Monte Carlo, to be 
managed by a court-appointed administrator.

He
 told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero earlier this year: ‘My mother 
needs an administrator - I fear she may no longer be capable of handling
 her affairs by herself.’

The lifestyle of his mother recently seen in 
the company of a 'very young manager,' had given Mr Skofic reason for 
concern, the newspaper reported.

However
 on Wednesday a judge in Rome rejected the request, ruling that the 
octogenarian diva was perfectly capable of managing her own finances.

According
 to a statement put out by the Hollywood star's agent, Paola Comin, the 
judge's ruling 'found that Ms Lollobrigida had no need of an 
administrator as she is, from a mental point of view, autonomous, 
coherent and lucid, in the light of an excellent interview with her. 

'The prosecutor was of the same opinion that there was no substance to 
any supposition to the contrary.'

She
 added: 'Gina Lollobrigida is left with the profound bitterness of a 
mother having to face and fight this deeply sad occurrence.'

'She always had faith in the understanding and reasoning of the judges and today that faith has been rewarded.'

Her
 lawyers, Fabrizio Siggia e Massimo Bersani, said they were satisfied 
and had maintained from the beginning 'the absence of any element that 
justified any such request'.

The case has additionally damaged the image
 of Ms Lollobrigida because of the pre-emptive media coverage, they 
said.

The actress, known for
 her rivalry with fellow Italian Sophia Loren, made headlines the world 
over last year when she claimed that her former boyfriend paid an 
impersonator to stand in for her at a proxy wedding in Spain in 2010.

Ms
 Lollobrigida first met Spanish businessman Javier Rigau y Rafols, 43 
years her junior, at a party in Monte Carlo in the 1980s.

The couple 
became companions and planned to marry in 2006 but Miss Lollobrigida 
changed her mind before the ceremony could take place.

The
 former sex symbol, who acted with Burt Lancaster and Humphrey Bogart, 
said she had no knowledge of her 2010 wedding to Mr Rafols and would 
never have agreed to it.

She only discovered it by chance on the 
internet with the help of her young male manager, Andrea Piazzolla.

She
 told the Daily Mail last year: 'I knew nothing about this until I did 
some research on the internet. He invented a false document to carry out
 this wedding and now he will pay.

'I will not rest until he has been 
brought to justice. He is nothing but a vulture, circling me, sniffing 
my blood. He married me and was waiting for me to die so he could 
inherit my possessions.'

But Rafols claimed the marriage was ‘completely legitimate,’ and witnessed by eight people.
