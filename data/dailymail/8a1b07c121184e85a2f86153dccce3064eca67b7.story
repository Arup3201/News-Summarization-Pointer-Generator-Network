A four-year-old girl was turned down for a place at her local primary school because she lived just one foot outside the catchment area, her outraged mother has claimed.

Maggie Scott had applied for a school less than half a mile from her Birmingham home, but was instead offered a place at a primary more than four times as far away.

Worse, her first choice - Boldmere Infant and Nursery School in Sutton Coldfield - was rated as outstanding by Ofsted, while Kings Rise Community Primary School in Kingstanding is in special measures.

Step too far: Maggie Scott, pictured with her mother Kath and brother Dylan, 2, was crushed when she was offered a place at a very different school

Maggie's mother Kath, 41, said the Local Education Authority (LEA) 
ruled that the family's home was 2,277 feet from their first choice 
school. The last place allocated was to a child who lived 2,276ft 
away - meaning Maggie lost out by just a foot.

Mrs Scott said: 'When I worked out it 
was 35cm (1ft), I thought it was ridiculous, a silly position to be put in 
over something so small.

'Thirty-five centimetres put me out of the bracket of my first choice school and into No Man’s Land.'

Mrs Scott said she was also turned down for two other closer schools - Wylde Green Primary and Holland House Infants - which are less than a mile from her home.

'We feel sad, failed, exasperated,' she added. 'I feel like I’m being punished for making the wrong choice.'

'When I rang the LEA they told me that I had picked schools which were oversubscribed.

Long journey: Mrs Scott said her daughter was also turned down for two other schools that are less than a mile from her home

'For the last five years, if you lived one kilometre away you would have gotten in. It’s not unreasonable to put these choices in.'

Mrs Scott plans to fight the decision and has joined forces with other mums who did not get their first-, second- or even third-choice schools in Sutton Coldfield.

Savannah Bus, four, was also given a place at Kings Rise after her three choices - including Boldmere - were rejected.

Her mother Nadine, 33,  said: 'My house is 807m (0.5 miles) from Boldmere. I went to the open day and we preferred Boldmere over the other schools as it suited my daughter’s personality.

'Last Monday, we got Kings Rise and it’s 2.2 miles door-to-door. It’s really angered us.'

The mothers have now launched a Facebook support group called Boldmere Mums and will be holding a meeting at Sutton Nursery School from 7.30pm on May 10.

Speaking out: Mothers Kath Scott and Nadine Bus have formed a group to campaign against what they view as unfair decisions on school places

No choice: Kings Rise Community Primary School in Kingstanding is more than two miles from Maggie's home

Birmingham City Council said there was not a 'catchment area' and emphasised that decisions were based on a number of criteria, of which distance from a school is just one.

A spokesman said: 'We know that school preference places are an important decision for parents/carers. The school admissions team processed over 15,000 applications which were carried out on an equal and fair basis, and we always advise parents to be realistic about their preferences.

'This year, 95 per cent got one of their preferences, and 85 per cent got their first preference.

'Any parent/carer who is unhappy with the place offered may submit an appeal for a place at a preferred school, provided that they included that school as one of their preferences.

'Staff in the school admissions team can offer advice to parents on why their child did not meet the admission criteria for their preferred school and the appeals process.'
