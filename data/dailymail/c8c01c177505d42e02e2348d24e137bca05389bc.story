Embattled NHS boss Sir David Nicholson was accused of ‘sticking two fingers up to patients’ yesterday as ministers expressed private astonishment at his appointment of a controversial new deputy.

Both Tory and Labour MPs criticised the elevation of Dame Barbara Hakin, the former head of the NHS in the West Midlands, despite claims that she gagged a whistleblower who was raising concerns about high patient death rates.

She is understood to dispute the allegations against her but is facing a General Medical Council investigation into her conduct.

Sir David, who is already facing intense pressure to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire scandal, in which as many as 1,200 patients died, shocked Whitehall by announcing that Dame Barbara was to be promoted to be his number two.

Her appointment is
temporary while someone is found to fill the role permanently.

The move comes amid signs that support for the head of the NHS Commissioning Board is draining away.

Ministers calling for him to be sacked blame a powerful trio – Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood, Cabinet Office minister Oliver Letwin and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt – for advising the Prime Minister to keep him on to see through health service reforms.

Government sources said ministers had no right to block the appointment of Dame Barbara, since the board is independent of government, but were neither consulted or given any notice. One minister said of Sir David: ‘This guy is not exactly racking up points in his favour.’

Tory MP Philip Davies said: ‘This appears to be a bizarre appointment which sticks two fingers up to NHS patients, but is business as usual for the people who are bringing the NHS into disrepute.’

Charlotte Leslie, another Conservative MP, said the appointment gave the impression of a ‘tight-knit, mafia-like group centring around David Nicholson’.

Hearing: Last week Sir David told MPs that gagging orders were 'completely and utterly unacceptable'

Labour MP Graham Stringer said: ‘Someone who seems to have presided over a culture of bullying should not be appointed to this role when the NHS needs desperately to move in a new direction.’

Chris Skidmore, a Tory member of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘There seems to be a managerial class that is dominating the health service, moving from post to post without ever properly answering for their actions elsewhere.’

Dame Barbara is said to have helped authorise a payment of £500,000 to silence the chief executive of a hospital trust where 670 patients are feared to have died needlessly. She is also being investigated by the GMC for allegedly quashing a report into high death rates at the trust, United Lincolnshire, in 2009.

Criticisms: Labour MP Graham Stringer is among the politicians who have criticised the appointment

Gary Walker, the whistleblower allegedly gagged by Dame Barbara, was chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals until 2010 when he was sacked after warning Dame Barbara that targets were being put ahead of patients.

He was later given a £500,000 payoff on the condition he keep quiet about shocking standards at the hospital. Last month he broke his silence to claim that Dame Barbara, then head of the East Midlands Strategic Health Authority supervising the hospital, had ordered him to prioritise targets.

Last week Sir David told MPs that gagging orders were ‘completely and utterly unacceptable.’ Six days later he promoted Dame Barbara to be his deputy.

When asked by MPs on the health select committee last Tuesday whether he was aware of gagging orders being used in the NHS, he said: ‘I am absolutely against them, and, wherever I see them, I try and stop them.’

Later he was asked specifically about Mr Walker’s gagging order. He replied: ‘It is completely and utterly unacceptable.’

Health ministers privately concede they do not expect Sir David to cling to his job in the long-term – but fear him being replaced by another proponent of Labour’s ‘command and control’ approach to the NHS. No one at the Department of Health was available for comment.

Appearing before a committee of senior MPs last night, David Cameron was challenged over the failure to hold anyone accountable for the Mid-Staffs scandal.

Tory MP Bernard Jenkin said there appeared to be an ‘unspoken conspiracy... that somehow the ministers are not responsible because the officials or people down the line were responsible, but we can’t hold the officials accountable because of the doctrine of ministerial accountability.’

The Prime Minister said the independent report into the scandal had cautioned against creating ‘scapegoats’ and had suggested that the main responsibility lay with the local hospital management and board.

‘The tragedy is that they weren’t held properly accountable at the time,’ the Prime Minister added.
