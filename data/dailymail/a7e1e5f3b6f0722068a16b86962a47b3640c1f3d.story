Rising star: Katie Leung, 25 has honed her craft at an acting course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and is landing lead roles

In the week that JK Rowling was revealed to have written a crime thriller under a male pseudonym, a star of the Harry Potter films has told of her own secret: that she nearly quit showbusiness.

Katie Leung – who found fame as the first girl to kiss Harry  Potter in the blockbuster films – admitted she suffered a massive crisis of confidence because she felt a fraud as an actress.

She was a 16-year-old Scottish schoolgirl with no acting experience when she was picked from 3,000 hopefuls at an open casting for the role of Cho Chang in Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire in 2004.

But
 while her Hogwarts co-stars used the Potter franchise as a stepping 
stone to greater things, Katie turned to photography, completing a 
degree course at Edinburgh College of Art.

However, after four years out of the limelight, the draw of showbusiness proved too strong.

Now
 25, Katie is 12 months into a three-year acting course at the Royal 
Conservatoire of Scotland and last week starred in the gritty Channel 4 
drama Run, which will be released on DVD tomorrow.

She has also played the lead in the first stage adaptation of Jung Chang’s Wild Swans and has a number of other roles lined up.

‘I
 will always be grateful for the opportunity the Harry Potter films gave
 me. But I came away from them thinking that I didn’t feel like a real 
actor,’ said Katie, who was a pupil at an independent school near her 
home in Motherwell, Lanarkshire, when her father took her to London for 
the Potter casting.

‘I felt a big part of what happened to me was based on luck. I did work very hard in the auditions and gave it my best shot.

'But I also wasn’t certain I wanted to rely on acting as a career because of the uncertainty of it. It has taken a while but now I feel more comfortable within myself.

'I’ve still got plenty to work on with my acting but with each role my confidence is growing.’ 

Katie paints a comical picture of her first day on a summer acting course at the Conservatoire.

She said: ‘We had to say our name, where we came from and any acting experience we’d had, so I didn’t see the point in hiding anything.

‘So I said, “Hi, my name is Katie, I’m from Motherwell, and I’ve been in the Harry Potter movies.” At that point someone shouted, “I knew it! I thought you looked familiar!” It was one of those hilarious moments.’

It is the sort of modesty which would chime with author Ms Rowling – who was last week unmasked as the author of The Cuckoo’s Calling, under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith.

That short course and the unstinting encouragement of Katie’s tutor persuaded her she might just have what it took to be an actor after all.

Shortly afterwards, she landed the part of a lifetime – as Jung Chang in Wild Swans. The story is Chang’s bestselling account of the lives of three generations of Chinese women – and it had a profound effect on Katie, whose divorced parents are of Chinese descent.

She said: ‘It’s probably the moment I decided I really did want to be an actor. Being on stage and having the immediate response from the audience made me feel really good about what I was doing.

'To see how it affected people, and for people to say they enjoyed it, really made it special.’

Her mother, Kar Wai Li, flew from Hong Kong to see her daughter tread the boards. She has lived in the former British colony since her marriage ended when Katie was three.

Katie’s father, Peter, a millionaire who runs a restaurant and food wholesale business in Glasgow, raised Katie and her brother, Jonathan, who is a year younger.

The Potter role – and that first kiss for Harry – led to jealous comments on the internet although Katie says she wasn’t ‘bothered too much by any of it’.

All grown up: Katie starred as Ying in TV series Run. The gruelling role tested her acting abilities as she plays an illegal immigrant who is raped

Katie’s latest role was in Run, which concluded last Thursday. Set on the streets of Brixton, South London, she played an illegal immigrant, and the role was a tough one as it involved her being raped. 

By her side throughout the past few years has been her boyfriend, recruitment consultant Eric Caira, a close friend of her brother Jonathan.

She and Eric first started chatting online as they played games of Call Of Duty.

She said: ‘We have different personalities – that’s why it works. And if I have confidence issues, he’s always been there for me.’

Katie has just spent two weeks in the Cotswolds filming an episode for the BBC’s Father Brown crime drama series.

She admits that thanks to Eric she has become something of a gaming addict. And after filming, the first thing she did when she returned to the new home she shares with Eric was switch on the PS3 games console – and crack open a beer!

Disarmingly, she said: ‘That’s what I really like to do more than anything. I find killing zombies and games like Call Of Duty really  therapeutic. If I could be a bloke and do things like that all the time, I’d be in heaven.’

Role of a lifetime: The 25-year-old bagged the lead part in the Young Vic's production of Wild Swans last year

Her next role means she will miss a month of drama school to play the lead in The World Of Extreme Happiness at the National Theatre, in London. 

Rehearsals for her part as Sunny – a girl who leaves her family in rural China for the promise of a job in a factory and a new life – begin in a few weeks.

The play is due to begin its month-long run on September 25. She admitted: ‘I’m over the moon but scared too. I hope I can do the part justice.’

With several serious roles under her belt, Katie has confessed she no longer feels like a ‘fraud’.

She said: ‘Harry Potter was so huge, it took me a few years to get to the point where I realised I would rather die than sit in an office nine to five.

'But the indecision has gone and now I’m committed to acting.’ It is clear Katie is determined to make up for lost time.
