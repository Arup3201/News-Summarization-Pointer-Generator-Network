Pleading for help, Edna Slann reaches out to her appalled family in desperation.

‘I’m starving,’ she says. ‘I’m bloody starving. Have you got anything to eat here now?’

While dementia has left the 89-year-old muddled in many ways, she is certain about one thing.

‘Oh god. I want something to eat,’ she begs, in harrowing video footage that shames Britain’s care system.

Harrowing: In footage taken by her granddaughter, an injured Edna Slann tells of being left thirsty and starving by staff at Grantley Court nursing home

The 89-year-old was evacuated from Grantley Court in Sutton, south London last year. Her family began filming her on visits over concerns she was being neglected

‘They keep you starving in here. This is not me at all. This is not normal, these b******* here are not normal. I just want to get out of this place.’

Mrs Slann, a widow who has dementia and arthritis and needs a wheelchair, was moved in July from a residential home to Grantley Court Nursing Home in Sutton, south-west London.

Her family claims she was neglected from the outset and her health rapidly deteriorated.

They said she lost more than half a stone in two months and is now little over five stone and reliant on morphine to control her pain.

She suffered severe facial bruising and a gash to her head which needed 12 stitches and now has just weeks to live.

Mrs Slann was filmed on September 21 by her granddaughter Becky, after she and her mother Linda Cackett, a book keeper from Epsom in Surrey, became fearful she was being neglected.

In a horrifying video, Mrs Slann can be seen pleading for help, while touching a large cut on her head.

Shaking with desperation and rage, she tells her granddaughter: ‘I’m hungry. Have you got anything to eat here now? I’m bloody starving. They keep you bleeding starving in here.’ 

She can be seen shutting her eyes in despair, while saying: ‘Oh god. I want something to eat. I’m angry. Give me something to eat.’

After the food does not come, she is seen lowering her expectations.

‘I just want a cup of tea, that’s all I want. Get us a cup of tea.’ She is reassured by staff that her food will come in ‘just 15 minutes’.

Later, she says: ‘Whatever’s happened to me? They’re making me bloody mad.

‘This effing place. It drives me round the bloody bend here. They are all bloody nutcases. I just want to get out of this place.’

After staff discovered a bedsore on her foot, she was taken to hospital. When hospital staff called Grantley Court for an explanation, they were apparently told it was ‘not that bad’.

Doctors said the only way to stop the spread would be to amputate her leg, involving serious surgery which would probably kill her.

Mrs Slann, a grandmother-of- one, worked as a cleaner until she was 70. She was a ‘lively and happy grandmother’, according to her family. Her daughter said it was ‘terrible’ to see how she has suffered.

She added: ‘It is horrendous to think that she has suffered.

‘We filmed her because she kept saying she was hungry. We feel guilty we let her go to Grantley Court. It is hard to talk about but I am speaking out because no one should go through this.’

Mrs Slann’s stay at Grantley Court cost £595 a week, which was met by Surrey Downs Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG).

A Surrey Downs CCG spokesman said she was relocated as soon as concerns were raised.

A Surrey council spokesman said when Mrs Slann was placed in Grantley Court the home had passed its most recent inspection.
