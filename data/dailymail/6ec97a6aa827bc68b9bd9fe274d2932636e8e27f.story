A 20-year-old Northern California college student has been arrested after he admitted to murdering his mother and slaughtering her three Chihuahuas with a pair of scissors, police say.

Joseph Badiali, who attends the University of California-Santa Cruz, was home visiting his mother Rosemary Badiali Saturday afternoon when he attacked her, according to authorities. 

His 92-year-old grandmother, who also lives in the Hayward, California, house, ran to a neighbor's house to call for help - telling 911 dispatchers that her grandson had attacked his mother.

When police arrived, they found Joseph Badiali standing in the middle of the street with blood on his hands, legs and shorts. He was raving that 'she's gone, she's dead,' authorities said.

Inside the home, officers found 57-year-old Ms Badiali in a pool of blood in the living room with several stab wounds to her head, according to authorities.

Police also found Ms Badiali's three dogs dead in the backyard bleeding from their heads. 

Cops have not said what  caused the horrific attack and are still investigating the motive. 

The murder shocked family members, who say they never saw it coming.

'He was a very good kid. Very amazing. This was very unlike him,' his aunt Ana Maria Badiali told the San Jose Mercury News. 

Facebook photos posted by Badiali's sister paint a portrait of a happy family - with Joseph and his three siblings seen smiling next to their mother and grandmother.  

The grandmother was home at the time of the attack and saw the aftermath, but did not witness the murder. 

Badiali faces charges of murder and three counts of cruelly wounding an animal.
