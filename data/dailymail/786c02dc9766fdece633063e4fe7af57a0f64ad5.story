U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder says the government has been constantly 'thinking about' and 'working on' ways to capture or kill British-raised ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John'.

'I think there is something to be said for holding accountable (and) getting at the people who are responsible for these barbaric acts,' Holder said in an interview with ABC News. 

'The vow that I can make to the American people, along with our allies, is that we will hold accountable all of the people who have been responsible for these heinous, barbaric acts. 

'That is something that we are focused on each and every day.'

However Holder refused to confirm the identity of the Islamist fanatic filmed beheading hostages in Syria, who has finally been named as London man Mohammed Emwazi.

'It would cut back any of the operational possibilities we have been considering,' he told ABC.

On Thursday, President Obama  also spoke somewhat cryptically on the action being taken to track down the man responsible for beheading several hostages, but said it would 'take time'.

'Eventually, if you hurt an American, you are going to be brought to justice in some fashion,' Obama told KOMO-TV. 'I'm confident we will get the job done. It will take a little bit of time but in the end, this death cult that has developed there ... is a dead end.'

British Prime Minister David Cameron also vowed to take Jihadi John 'out of action'.

On Thursday, Jihadi John was unmasked as Mohammed Emwazi.

Kuwaiti-born Emwazi moved to Britain as a six-year-old child – and quickly embraced British life, playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United.

Neighbours recalled a polite, quietly spoken boy who was studious at his Church of England school, where he was the only Muslim pupil in his class.

After finishing primary school in 1999, Emwazi moved to Quintin Kynaston Community Academy, in St John's Wood, where he is believed to have studied alongside former X Factor judge and pop star Tulisa Contostavlos

Once there, he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional Islamic dress, and his sisters began to wear the hijab.

In August 2009, after his graduation, Emwazi flew to Tanzania where they were picked up by MI5 – who accused him of planning to travel to Somalia to join the militant group Al Shabaab.

Mr Cameron said: 'When there are people anywhere in the world who commit appalling and heinous crimes against British citizens we will do everything we can with the police with the security services with all that we have at our disposal to find these people and put them out of action.'

The PM said this was his 'number one priority'.   

The ISIS executioner Jihadi John was finally identified as Londoner Mohammed Emwazi on Thursday

Mr Cameron said: 'I work very closely with our security services. I meet with them regularly, I ask them searching questions about that they do – and in my almost five years of experience as Prime Minister I think they are incredibly impressive, hardworking, dedicated, courageous and affective at protecting our country.

'All of the time they are having to make incredibly difficult judgements and I think basically they make very good judgements on our behalf.

'While we are in the middle of this vast effort to make sure British citizens are sage, the most important thing is to get behind them.'
