A new and rapidly growing coffee shop chain that claims to be a family-run business is backed by Tesco’s billions, it has emerged.

Harris + Hoole describes itself on its website as ‘a family affair’ and the name comes from a London coffee shop mentioned in the diary of Samuel Pepys in 1664.

The style of the outlets, from chalkboard menus to rustic chopping boards, gives every impression of being independent, artisan and high quality.

However, it is 49 per cent owned by Tesco, the country’s biggest and richest retailer with the financial muscle to take on the likes of Starbucks and Costa.

Harris + Hoole was launched last August and already has ten outlets with plans for many more.

The company was set up by Nick, Andrew and Laura Tolley, who are quick to point out that while Tesco is providing cash, they are in charge of the business.

Harris + Hoole does not shout about its relationship with Tesco.

There is nothing in the name or decor, although the links are revealed on the website.

Rivals have been surprised about its link to the chain. Feyzan Ulker, of My Kind Of Coffee, a cafe close to one of the new outlets in north London, said: ‘Tesco isn’t stupid. They don’t want their name to be part of the name.

Harris + Hoole is named after coffee-loving characters in the Diary of Samuel Pepys

‘They know it doesn’t match with the artisan values they are trying to make money out of. It is cheating. It’s lying.’

Andrew Simms, the author of Tescopoly, which charted the supermarket’s rise, doubted it would take a hands-off approach.

‘I find it unimaginable that Tesco won’t exert a strong influence,’ he said. ‘Historically, Tesco’s interest has always been about maximising profit and return to shareholders.’ 

Nick Tolley said: ‘If you Google it, you’ll find it. Go to our web page, it’s not hidden.

‘Putting it any more prominently would not reflect who we are as a business.’
