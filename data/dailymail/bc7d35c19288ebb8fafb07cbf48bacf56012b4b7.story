A mother-of-two fears she may never walk again after falling 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream in holiday in Mexico.

Marie Honey, 48, from Ormskirk, Lancashire, was knocked unconscious, suffered cuts and bruises, damaged her coccyx and fractured her spine in three places.

The nurse was on the last day of a holiday in Mexico for her niece's wedding last year when the accident happened.

Terrifying: Marie Honey, 48, fell 10ft down a concrete hole while on a dream holiday in Mexico

She was walking over a hole which had been covered by a piece of wood at the when it suddenly gave way and she plummeted 10ft to the concrete-lined surface below.

Marie suspects the sheet of wood, which had been painted green, collapsed because it was rotten.

She spent the next three nights in a Mexican hospital terrified because she had no idea what injuries she had suffered and very few staff spoke English.

After being flown home in a fully reclined position she had to wear a back brace for three months.

Almost a year later, Marie is still unable to walk properly.

She has had to undergo surgery to her back and still needs crutches to help her with day-to-day tasks.

She said: 'We had all been so 
excited for our holiday in Mexico and to see my niece Kerrie get 
married.

'It was beautiful and the wedding day was perfect but the 
memories have been ruined forever by what happened on my last day out 
there.'

Ruined: Marie, pictured between her daughters Kate, 24, and Rosie, 21, had been enjoying her niece's wedding in Mexico when the she fell down a 10ft concrete hole in the grounds of her hotel (right)

'I didn’t even notice the hole cover 
because it was painted green presumably to be concealed within the grass
and it gave way before I even realised what I was standing on.

'It was only afterwards that I saw that the cover was not only just a sheet of wood but it also looked like it was rotten.

Frightening: Marie fears she may never walk again after having surgery on her back

'I banged my head in the fall and I 
think that I was knocked out.'

'When I came round I started screaming 
because of the pain but the only way to get out of the hole was to climb
a ladder that the hotel lowered down.

'It took every ounce of energy in my body to do it and I was in agony.

'I couldn’t understand what was going 
on in the hospital because not many people spoke English and I was 
terrified that I would never walk again.

'I was eventually allowed to fly home but under strict conditions that I was to be fully reclined 
throughout and that I sought immediate follow up care upon my return.

'Thankfully, the medics in the UK have
been fantastic but I still have a long way to go and I am still not 
sure what my future holds.'

Joseph Dawson, a specialist lawyer in 
accidents abroad at Irwin Mitchell, is representing Marie against the 
tour operator TUI UK Ltd.

He said: 'This is a horrendous case that
has left a woman who was very dedicated to her profession and caring 
for others, unable to work and virtually housebound.

'The terrible injuries she sustained are likely to affect her life forever.

Nightmare: Marie's horrendous injuries included a damaged coccyx and a fractured spine in three places

'We are pleased to hear the hotel has apparently since taken measures to ensure the area is safe.

'At this stage liability has not yet been admitted by TUI UK Ltd and I understand that they are investigating the circumstances of the accident with the hotel management.

'I hope, however, that the tour operator will work with us swiftly to ensure that Marie has access to the best support and rehabilitation services possible so she can try and rebuild her life and get some freedom back.'
