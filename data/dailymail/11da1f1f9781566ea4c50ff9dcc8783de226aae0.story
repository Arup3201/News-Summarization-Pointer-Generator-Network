They really are the unlikeliest of couples.

One is a millionaire Hollywood actress adored as one of the world's most beautiful women - and the other is William Hague.

Britain's Foreign Secretary teamed up with stunning Angelina Jolie yesterday as they joined forces for a government drive to tackle sexual violence in war zones around the world.

The 36-year-old actress, who is engaged to Brad Pitt, was speaking at the Foreign Office in London before a screening of her new film In The Land Of Blood And Honey.

Guest speaker: Mr Hague invited the actress to talk on his initiative on preventing sexual violence in conflict zones ahead of the screening

A Tearfund report last year outlined U.N. global statistics showing one in five women will become a victim of rape or attempted rape in her lifetime.

'Sexual violence is an issue which is central to conflict prevention and to peace building worldwide,' 51-year-old Mr Hague said.

'Where there is no justice, the seeds of future conflict are sown, and development is held back.'
