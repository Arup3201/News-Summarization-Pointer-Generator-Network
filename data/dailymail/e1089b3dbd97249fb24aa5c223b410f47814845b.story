The buzz around Condoleezza Rice becoming Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate has increased significantly after internet pioneer Matt Drudge reported that she is ‘near the top’ of his shortlist.

Mr Romney could name his running mate as early as next week, significantly before the traditional time of just before the party convention in late August.

He is widely expected to name a safe, unexciting figure in order to keep the focus of the election on President Barack Obama’s record.

The next Vice President? Condoleezza Rice allegedly has a good chance of being Mitt Romney's running mate

Ms Rice, President George W. Bush’s 
national security adviser for four years and then his Secretary of 
State, would be a stunning choice and fly in the face of almost 
everything Mr Romney himself and his advisers have indicated they want 
in a running mate.

Mr Drudge used his Drudge Report 
website to tease readers with an ‘exclusive’ story: ‘a surprise name is 
now near the top of the list: Former Secretary of State Condoleezza 
Rice!’

He added: ‘It was Condi who received 
two standing ovations at Romney's Utah retreat a few weeks ago, and 
everyone left with her name on their lips.’

The Stanford University professor has
never run for office or faced anything like the intense personal 
scrutiny vice-presidential candidates have to go through. She has no 
domestic policy experience and has said he favours abortion rights – a 
position that would make her anathema to conservatives and some 
independent voters.

She is very closely associated with 
Mr Bush and the unpopular Iraq war and has no executive experience. 
After the 2008 election, she hinted strongly that she voted for Mr Obama
rather than Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee.

Announcement: A Romney spokesman has revealed that the running mate will be chosen soon

Aged 57, Ms Rice has never married 
and is seen as something of an introvert. She has repeatedly made clear 
over the years that she does not believe she is cut out for the rigours 
of a political campaign.

The floating of her name could well 
be a ploy to shift the subject of political conversation away from Mr 
Romney’s record at Bain Capital, which is currently taking a hammering, 
and to appeal to women voters, who tend to lean Democratic. As a black 
woman, she would also have some appeal to minority voters and 
independents.

Presidential candidates often 
indicate they are considering unusual choices and almost always indicate
that a woman or a minority is under consideration, in large part to 
placate different party and voting constituencies.

But Mr Romney has strongly indicated 
he will go for a middle-aged white man with executive experience or a 
Washington track record that goes beyond foreign policy.

His advisers are determined to avoid 
repeating what they see as the mistake Mr McCain made in 2008 when he 
gambled on an inexperienced female – Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska – as
his running mate.

Ms Palin’s inability to answer basic 
political questions in high-pressure interviews and the drip, drip of 
revelations from Alaska of events from her past that had escaped the 
notice of Mr McCain’s vetters, who had only given her cursory 
consideration, bedevilled and divided his campaign.

Close: Ms Rice was a long-standing ally of George W. Bush as National Security Adviser and Secretary of State

Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Tim Pawlenty, former governor of Minnesota, are considered the favourites.

Also very much in the running are 
Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Governor Bobby Jindal of 
Louisiana, while Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey and Senator Marco
Rubio of Florida are much more likely picks than Ms Rice.

Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire
and Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico probably have a stronger 
chance than Ms Rice. Senator John Thune of South Dakota and Governor Bob
McDonnell of Virginia are also frequently mentioned.

Senior Romney foreign policy advisers
like John Bolton, Bush’s hardline ambassador to the UN, are highly 
sceptical about Ms Rice’s abilities. The memoirs of Vice President Dick 
Cheney, who holds a fundraiser in Wyoming for Romney this week, and 
Donald Rumsfeld, depict her unfavourably.

Ms Rice spoke to Romney donors at the
Utah retreat last month and was well received. She later told CBS News:
‘I talked about the need for American leadership; I talked about the 
importance of the United States to a more peaceful world, a world that 
has been quite turbulent in recent years and needs a strong American 
anchor.

‘But I also talked about the essence of America, and perhaps that's what people resonated with.’

In the same interview she dampened 
speculation that she might be Mr Romney's running mate: ‘I didn't run 
for student council president. I don't see myself in any way in elective
office.’

She added: ‘I'm saying there is no 
way I will do this, because it's really not me, I know my strengths. 
Governor Romney needs to find someone who wants to run with him. There 
are many people who will do it very, very well, and I'll support the 
ticket.’

The news came as Mr Obama apologised 
for not inspiring the public enough as president, telling CBS This 
Morning he regretted 'thinking that this job was just about getting the 
policy right.'
