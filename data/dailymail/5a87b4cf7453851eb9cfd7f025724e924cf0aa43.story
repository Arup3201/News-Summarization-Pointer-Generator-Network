This time last year Neil Trotter was living in a three-bedroom suburban semi on a busy main road.

But he has since moved somewhere rather more desirable after scooping £108million to become Britain’s fourth biggest Lottery winner.

The former car mechanic now has a £5million medieval mansion to call home, with its own private lake and more than 400 acres of land.

Jackpot: Mr Trotter (pictured with his partner Nicky Ottaway) has moved somewhere rather more desirable after scooping £108million to become Britain’s fourth biggest Lottery winner

Motorsport enthusiast Mr Trotter, 41, spoke last year of his plans to buy a new house with room for horses for his partner, Nicky Ottaway, 33, and a fleet of supercars for himself. 

‘There are a lot of stunning cars out there – I’m going to need a lot of garage space at the new house,’ he said. The EuroMillions winner also described how the couple hoped to find a ‘slower pace of living’ by moving to the country.

After spending months looking at properties in the Home Counties, Mr Trotter recently acquired a stunning home deep in the Kent countryside.

The eight-bedroom Grade II-listed manor house has been extended and renovated over the years. It enjoys sensational views across landscaped gardens and the lake, and is surrounded by woods and fields.

Inside, large wood-beamed rooms and vast stone open fireplaces give the property the feel of a medieval squire’s home. 

There is also a separate three-bedroom oast house with a distinctive conical roof, converted from a traditional building used to dry hops for beer.

Plenty of room, then, for Mr Trotter and his partner, although they are likely to be visited by his daughter from a previous relationship who lives with her mother.

Mr Trotter revealed last year that it was his dream to own luxury cars including a £866,000 McLaren P1 supercar and classic racers such as the Sierra Cosworth. But his new neighbours will be pleased to learn he ruled out building a race track.

There was no sign of any supercars at the mansion this week, although two new Range Rovers were parked outside the oast house. 

It is a far cry from Mr Trotter and Miss Ottaway’s modest former home in Coulsdon, Surrey.

His father bought him the property for £186,000 in 2006 but it was ‘absolutely derelict’, meaning he had to strip it back throughout and replace the roof, ceilings and floors.

He made a tidy profit when he sold the house for just under £400,000 in September. 

Neighbours described how the couple moved out ‘almost overnight’ after they scooped the EuroMillions jackpot last March.

Mr Trotter admitted at the time that he was like his namesake, Del Boy Trotter from Only Fools And Horses. 

He said: ‘I always knew I’m going to be a millionaire. I’m a Trotter so it’s going to happen at some stage. I have always believed, and it obviously works.’ 

The couple had been unaccustomed to spending money on themselves before their massive win. Mr Trotter had to buy new shirts because previously he wore his paint-spattered work clothes all the time.

Speaking this week, Mr Trotter declined to comment.
