Women keen to increase their bust size but who despair at the £5,000 cost of a surgery may have an alternative solution.

One company is offering a non-invasive breast enlargement treatment for a tenth of the cost - and it boasts impressive results.

The pain-free treatment - delivered via a machine called the Wonderlift - claims to leave clients with a bust size of up to two times larger.

The machine is a suction pump device which claims to improve the elasticity of skin tissue and shape and firm the breast.

A woman tests out the device on This Morning saying 'it's quite comfortable. It just feels like suction really'

The machine promises to firm, lift and tone - and comes in at £50 per treatment

During treatment, the suction is followed by vibration
 massage to stimulate the breast regrowth, low frequency current to 
stimulate the blood and lymph 
circulation and prevent hyperplasia of mammary glands (abnormal cell development), and finally 
low-level light therapy intended to assist with skin elasticity, smoothness, rejuvenation, 
and spot and freckle removal.

Wonderlift's founder Sajida Rashid says: 'The way we work is consumer led. I ask my clients what they're looking for and we deliver it.

‘After 12 week course, plus six follow up treatments, results should last up to two years.’

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, a young woman named Nicole tried out the breast enlarger.

She said: 'It's quite comfortable. It just feels like suction really. 

'I wanted to try this treatment because I’ve been for surgery consultations but I’m cautious of going under knife.

'I’ve had three treatments so far and think my breasts look fuller and feel firmer,' she said. Though Ruth and Phillip said they 'haven’t spotted major difference'.

Journalist Stephen Handisides, who for the last 11 years has been known for his work around cosmetic surgery, dentistry and beauty, said on This Morning: 'I think it’s a good treatment, but after the first treatment people should see some results, though it is important to follow up and have two to three treatments within the first week.

'You do have to have the time to go and have these treatments.'

Ms Rashid has just sold machines to salons and clinics in London, nationwide and even Duba where practitioners are being trained to use them.

She has priced the treatment at £50, but a course of 12 is recommended, which she offers to clients for £500.

The same machine, she says, can perform a bottom lift and enhancement via the same technologies it uses to firm and enlarge breasts.

'It can reduce cellulite and lift the glutes up.'

Although her background is not in the 
beauty industry, Rashid's passion for the industry led to her opening
 Glow Beauty salon in Leeds in 2008 - a decision she says she has never 
regreted.

Muscle re-education is the process of lengthening or shortening muscles.

The 
procedure sends a current to lift and re-educate muscles.

The current 
stimulates Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), a nucleotide that can 
accumulate in the muscles themselves.

The beautician later expanded her reach and won an award for one of her innovative treatments.

'I partnered with HLCC USA as an Exclusive UK distributor in 2011 and won Most Innovative Treatment And Service 2012 for HLCC UK by MyfaceMybody, then my salon was awarded Best Beauty Salon in Leeds 2012-2013.

'I came across non-surgical breast enhancing last year in the USA when the PIP implants had much media coverage and decided that I would like to launch this within the UK and worldwide.

'The treatment has been around for 
long time, it's similar to cupping - but with the added benefits of 
following therapies for maximum results.'

Vacuum suction is used to manipulate fat tissue, which is mainly what breasts are made up of.

The intense suction will also assist with pectoral muscle contraction which is what provides the breast area with shape.

When a muscle lengthens or shortens, the skin lifts and firms. Vacuum suction also helps to increase blood circulation thus eliminating toxins through the lymph.

The machine also employs so-called micro current therapy which promises to stimulate regeneration of nerves and soft tissue.

Benefits of the micro current according to Rashid include improved muscle tone, muscle re-education, lifting, improved blood circulation, aided lymphatic drainage and increased collagen and elastin production.
