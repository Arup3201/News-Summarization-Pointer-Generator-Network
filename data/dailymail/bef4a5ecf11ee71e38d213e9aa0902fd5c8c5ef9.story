For most people, Kirby vacuum cleaners are nothing more than a household necessity.

But for Dylan Greene, who has autism, they are his greatest passion - and have been for 12 years.

So, for his 14th birthday, the teenager's mother decided to do something extra special to celebrate.

Jodie Greene, from Chesterfield County, Virginia, sent an email to the Kirby Company - the Cleveland-based makers of the Kirby vacuum - explaining how her son had never been into 'normal' toys.

In it, she wrote: 'I am reaching out to you in hopes for an answer to an unusual request for my son who is autistic. He has always been obsessed with vacuum cleaners. His favorite is the Kirby.

'He spends hours every day watching videos on his tablet about different Kirbys. When he isn’t watching videos, he is talking about them. I really would LOVE to get a demo done for him for his birthday. I am writing to you in hopes that you can get me in touch with a way to get him this demo.'

The mother-of-two went on to explain that she did not intend to buy a Kirby - but hoped she may be able to pay a flat fee or host salesmen who needed to conduct practice demos for training purposes.

'I do not want anything free, but as the mother of a special needs child, it is so hard to find things to make my son happy,' she said. 'I know that having this demo done would just be so awesome, and it would warm my heart to see him so excited to experience that.'

Ecstatic: Later in the day, Mr Archie - who has been selling vacuums for the Kirby Company for a quarter of his century - presented a joyful Dylan with his best gift of all: A brand new Kirby vacuum cleaner (pictured)

Ms Greene's heartfelt email did not go unnoticed by the company - not only did its bosses gift Dylan with a Kirby-branded soccer ball, hat and T-shirt, they also sent salesman Al Archie to his house.

On his birthday, the teenager and his family and friends were treated to a vacuum demonstration from Mr Archie, who had traveled from Fredericksburg to fulfill Dylan's wish, according to WTVR.

And after his demonstration, the salesman - who has been selling vacuums for Kirby for a quarter of his century - presented Dylan with his best gift of all: A brand new Kirby vacuum cleaner.

'At the end of the demonstration [he] gave my son a brand new Kirby vacuum,' Ms Greene, who also made a vacuum birthday cake for Dylan, said. 'There was not a dry eye in the house.'

Making an impact: 'At the end of the demo [he] gave my son a brand new Kirby vacuum,' Ms Greene (left), said. 'There was not a dry eye in the house.' Right, Dylan has apparently been 'over the moon' ever since

Speaking after his demonstration, Mr Archie said he had arranged for Dylan to receive the vacuum cleaner because he was touched by the Swift Creek Middle School student's passion for them.

'I wanted to do something for him,' he said. '[It was] an opportunity to give something back.'

He added that the teenager had impressed him by 'knowing more about the Kirby than I did.' Kirby vacuum cleaners can typically cost from $400 upward. 

Dylan, who first picked up a vacuum aged two, has been 'over the moon' since his birthday treat.
