Tony Pulis wants to add Paul Jewell to his new-look coaching team at West Bromwich Albion.

And the the new Baggies boss also wants to draft in Carlo Nash to be his goalkeeping coach at the Hawthorns. 

The Midlands club confirmed the departures of coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely with immediate effect on Monday following the sacking of Alan Irvine last week.

And Pulis has wasted no time in shaking-up his back-room team at the Midlands club and is close to making his first two new captures. 

Jewell, who has been out of work since leaving Ipswich in 2012, is set to join as first-team coach.

Nash, who played for Pulis at Stoke, will work with the club's goalkeepers.

Pulis' trusted assistant Dave Kemp has already joined, while Gerry Francis is set to agree a part-time coaching role.

West Bromwich Albion today announce the departures of senior coaches Rob Kelly, Keith Downing and Dean Kiely.

The trio have left the club with immediate effect as Tony Pulis prepares to finalise the appointment of a new backroom staff.

Director of football administration Richard Garlick said: 'The Club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure.

'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

'Rob joined at the start of the season and became a valued member of the coaching set-up.

'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff.

'We wish to thank them for their efforts and wish them all the very best in their future endeavours.'

Downing became first-team coach under Roy Hodgson, in March 2011, before being elevated to Assistant Head Coach in December 2011 following the departure of Michael Appleton to become Portsmouth manager.

Following Steve Clarke's departure in December 2013, Downing took the reins at The Hawthorns in caretaker capacity - his side winning one and drawing three of his five Barclays Premier League games in charge.

Albion recruited Downing as Academy Under-18s coach in July 2009. He also became responsible for running the Baggies' Barclays Premier Reserve League team at the start of the 2010/11 campaign.

Kelly joined Albion as Alan Irvine's Joint-Assistant Head Coach alongside Downing in June.

Kiely became Albion Goalkeeper Coach in March 2010.

The former Republic of Ireland man initially joined the club as a player in January 2007, helping the club to the Championship play-off final later that year.

The following season he scooped the Championship's 2007/08 Puma Golden Glove thanks to his 18 clean sheets in all competitions after helping Albion clinch the title and reach and FA Cup semi-final.

He made 88 appearances for Albion as a player.

In confirming the departures of Kelly, Downing and Kiely, Richard Garlick, the club’s director of football administration, said: 'The club would like to place on record its deep appreciation for the contribution of Keith, Rob and Dean within the coaching structure.

'Keith and Dean have been here a number of years and took over first-team control in a caretaker capacity during a difficult period last season. They played a key role in stabilising the team.

'Changes in personnel are part of football life and it is obviously sad to say farewell to three popular and respected members of staff.'
