QPR have announced that midfielder Esteban Granero has returned to Spain after joining Real Sociedad for an undisclosed fee.

The 27-year-old has signed a four-year contract with the Basque outfit until 2018.

Granero moved to the Hoops from Real Madrid in 2012 and made 28 appearances during his first season for the club.

On the move: QPR midfielder Esteban Granero has joined Real Sociedad

Sparse: The Spanish midfielder made just 28 appearances for QPR in two seasons at the club

But he left the club for Sociedad on loan last summer following QPR's relegation from the Premier League.

Unfortunately for him, however, a serious knee injury limited the former Spain Under-21 international to just six appearances in all competitions.

A QPR statement read: 'The club would like to thank Esteban for his contribution during his time at Loftus Road and wish him well for the future.'Â
