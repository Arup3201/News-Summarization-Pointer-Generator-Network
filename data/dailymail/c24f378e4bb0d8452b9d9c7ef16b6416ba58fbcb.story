An American cartoonist remains in hiding four years after she suggested a 'Everybody Draw Mohammed Day'.

Molly Norris, a former cartoonist with the Seattle Weekly, disappeared on advice from the FBI after Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki put her on a hit list.

The revelations of the long term repercussions of satirizing Mohammed came to light after the horrific massacre of Charlie Hebdo staff last week.

'She had to completely change her identity, disappear from her work,' Larry Kelley, the founder of the Free Molly Norris Foundation, told KOMO-TV.

Mr Kelley said Ms Norris is the first U.S. journalist working in the country to be forced into hiding by 'radical Islam.'

Ms Norris had attempted to satire Comedy Central for censoring imagery of the Prophet Muhammad on TV show South Park. Her cartoons depicted Muhammad's likeness as a tea cup, domino, box of pasta and spool of thread.

The move sparked a campaign for artists to draw the icon, something that is forbidden by the Quran. 

A Facebook page for the May 20 event garnered several thousand attendees to 'defend a little our country is famous for ... the first first amendment,' her cartoon stated.

Islamic militant Anwar al-Awlaki, who was killed in a U.S. drone attack, had put Ms Norris on a hit list

Al-Awlaki then named Norris as a 'prime target'.

A year later the American-born cleric was killed during a U.S. drone strike, while on the run in Yemen.  

Despite his death, the New York Daily News reports that Norris has not come home after leaving behind her friends and family. 

The ordeal stressed Norris out to the point that she lost seven pounds, she said before going underground.
