A 23-year-old man called 999 claiming he was American rapper Nicki Minaj, while he was drunk

A 23-year-old  man has been banned from drinking after he called 999 claiming he was rapper Nicki Minaj and that he had seen a ghost while he was drunk.

Steven Brown from Crumlin, Country Antrim in Northern Ireland, made two calls within five minutes of each other to the emergency services on Christmas Day, a court heard.

The first call was reportedly made at about 10.15am on December 25 where Brown claimed two men were making threats to kill him but was too intoxicated to provide more information.

Prosecutors at Belfast High Court said that five minutes later he rang again and told the operator he wanted to cancel the first call, according to the Irish Times.

During the second call he also claimed to be the 32-year-old American rapper and said there was a poltergeist in his house.

The court was told the phone calls were in breach of a previous ASBO, which banned him from using the emergency number.

Brown did not deny making the calls when police arrived at his house to arrest him and told officers he felt there was an emergency when he dialled the number.

Prosecutors told the court that he Brown had recently been released from prison 'after serving a sentence for offences of a similar nature' and that he was an alcoholic. 

A defence barrister said Brown had been released from hospital and was taking medication but, against the advice of doctors, had consumed alcohol.

Lord Justice Coghlin, hearing the bail application, said: 'This man is essentially a nuisance, which no doubt is a product of his alcoholism.

'Police have better things to do that cope with these telephone calls.”

Brown was released on his own bail of £250, banned him from possessing and consuming alcohol and from dialling 999, except in an emergency. He also imposed a 10pm-7am curfew.
