A mysterious identification note was found on Warrant singer Jani Lane's person when his body was discovered.

Members of Lane's family are furious that the 'friend' did not offer proper help to the 47-year-old when they were aware of his substance abuse problem, TMZ report.

TMZ also claim that the musician's Comfort Inn room was not purchased by him. It is currently unclear whether the same friend who wrote the note also booked the room.

An autopsy has been completed and results from the toxicology report will be released soon, the website reports.

The death is being treated as accidental or due to natural causes and not suspicious.

The star's body was found on August 11 at a Comfort Inn hotel in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles.

The singer was famous for his long blonde hair and skin tight leather ensembles, which embodied the glam rock eighties.

His Warrant bandmates paid tribute to the frontman, saying they were 'deeply saddened' by his passing.

Erik Turner, the band's guitarist who
also co-founded Warrant, has now revealed the group will officially pay
tribute to Lane during their concert in North Dakota tonight.

Turner told TMZ.com: 'We will be making a tribute before we play the song Heaven tonight.

'We never thought that when the song 
'Heaven' was written we would be playing it some day in the memory of 
Jani's untimely death.

'This is a very sad day for rock and roll. One of the great things about music is that it lives on forever.'

Lane had an on-off relationship with 
the band, leaving in 1992 before returning and quitting again several 
times. He left for the last time in 2008, citing writing differences.

was a good-hearted guy with a gentle soul. I know he had a tough life 
and many battles, but who doesn't? He seemed to be genuinely working so 
hard at sorting things out and getting things in order. It's a true 
shame.'
