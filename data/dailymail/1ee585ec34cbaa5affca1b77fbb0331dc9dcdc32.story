Reverend Al Sharpton has blasted Sony executive Amy Pascal over racially charged comments that were made public in her hacked emails - and says it's part of an overwhelming problem of lack of diversity in Hollywood.

'Right now, Hollywood is like the Rocky Mountains. The higher up it goes, the whiter it looks,' he quipped to TMZ. 

Sharpton and two other black leaders are meeting with Pascal at her request after she was forced to apologize for comments she made about President Barack Obama in leaked emails.

Al Sharpton says the comments revealed in Amy Pascal's hacked emails are part of a much wider problem with lack of diversity in Hollywood

He told TMZ it won't be easy for the embattled Sony Pictures co-chairman to avoid his condemnation. 

'If people have a culture of acting like it's OK to joke about the President of the United States only watching black movies - this is what are were saying in 2014,' Sharpton said. 

He added: 'I don't know who's behind the hack. I know what I've read about the hack. And I'm going to give her a lot of heck about the hack.'

Pascal, it was revealed, joked with film producer Scott Rubin over email about what she talk to President Barack Obama about during a breakfast meeting.

She then offers that the president probably liked 'Django Unchained' - a violent film about a slave freeing himself. Mr Rubin counters with '12 Years a Slave' and then 'Ride-along.'

'Ride-along. I bet he likes Kevin Hart,' Mr Rubin writes.

RadarOnline also reports that in one email she says TV deals are the new 'black baby' in Hollywood -which Radar says is a jab at stars who adopt African and African American children.

Pascal has asked to meet with Sharpton, as well as the head of the Urban League and the head of the NAACP in an effort to smooth over her comments.

Pascal was responsible for greenlighting the new 'Annie' film featuring black leads - including in the title role 

However, Sharpton says that matters little if none of the top executives in Hollywood are diverse. 

 'That's product, that's selling to consumers,' he said.

'Who makes the decisions? Who does the budgets? Who writes the checks? That's what we want to know.'
