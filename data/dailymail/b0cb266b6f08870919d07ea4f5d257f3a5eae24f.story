The eating habits of some of the world's most powerful people have been revealed at a meeting of top chefs in London.

The Club des Chefs, which is made up of those who cook for heads of state and political leaders, met in the capital for its annual get-together this week.

They revealed that the Queen does not eat shellfish, Prince Philip likes a lager with his lunch and Barack Obama cannot stand beetroot.

The Queen is said to have told the kitchen of one head of state that she doesn't eat shellfish. Meanwhile, Prince Philip is said to enjoy a daily beer with his lunch

Meanwhile, French President Francois Hollande hates artichokes, his predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy doesn't like cheese and Russian premier Vladimir Putin has his food tasted by a member of staff to ensure it is not poisoned.

Rosaleen McBride, who cooks for Irish presidents, revealed the Queen's aversion to shellfish after speaking to Her Majesty's head chef, Mark Flanagan.

The Times reported Mr Flanagan would not say whether his employer disliked the taste of the seafood or whether her dietary requirements were due to health fears.

Ms McBride also told the paper that her staff bought lager for Prince Philip after hearing that he has been drinking beer at lunchtime for decades.

A former royal chef has previously claimed the Queen dislikes potatoes, starts the day with Kellogg's Special K and enjoys a gin and Dubonnet nightcap.

Despite the claims she does not eat shellfish, staff at Buckingham Palace served crayfish as a starter when President Obama visited the UK in 2011, although beetroot remained off the menu.

The secrets emerged when the Club des Chefs, made up of those who cook for heads of state, met in London

The 21-member Club des Chefs gathered at London's Hakkasan Michelin-starred restaurant on a Sunday evening.

Among them was Barack Obama’s personal chef, Cristeta Comerford, Tim Wasylko, chef for the Canadian prime minister Stephen Harper, and French President Francois Hollande's cook Bernard Vaussion.

Hilton Little, the chef to the president of the South Africa, who also served the late president Nelson Mandela, revealed Mandela loved homemade stews and once impressed a guest by serving bangers and mash.

Amid growing global anger at his boss's regime, President Putin's chef did not attend the event.

It is believed the chefs refuse to tell each other their employer's favourite meals, due to fears leaders will be served the same meal everywhere they go.

The group reportedly tried traditional fish and chips while they were in Britain and even attempted to make pork pies.
