If home really is where the heart is then Tugay Kerimoglu can prepare to be confused as Arsenal attempt to get their European campaign back on track at home to Galatasaray on Wednesday.

For 14 years, Tugay prowled midfield for Galatasaray, the club he supported as a boy, and he has returned to Istanbul to coach them twice, as assistant manager to Gheorghe Hagi and again in the same role for Roberto Mancini.

He and Mancini left in May after winning the Turkish Cup and finishing second in the league. Tugay is now living in his London apartment at what was once Highbury Stadium while considering his next move.

He is certain about one thing. ‘No more assistant,’ said Tugay, a rugged figure in double-denim with his grey hair swept back to his collar as it was when he played.

He is ready to manage. ‘The stress doesn’t matter,’ the 44-year-old added. ‘It’s part of football. I learned that you have to confront it if you’re to be successful.

‘I listened to my managers taken something from them all: Mark Hughes, Graeme Souness, Fatih Terim; all different approaches. It all comes to this point.

‘I worked closely for eight months with Roberto Mancini. By the end of the season we had the team settled and looking good but you never know what is going to happen.’

Except, at Galatasaray you can have a good guess if you finish one place behind Fenerbahce, their fierce rivals from the Asian side of the Bosphorus.

‘The club has no patience,’ said Tugay. ‘In Turkey, you have to win the title every year. That is the only measure of success. In England, it is more about what the manager thinks; his philosophy.

‘I remember at Blackburn once, we lost 10 games at home in a season and there was no-one calling for the manager to be sacked. In Turkey it is all about the scoreboard. It’s a cultural thing. In Turkey, we think with our hearts.’

Tugay has never been one to talk much, preferring to go about his business on the field, but he has seen fiery moments when the passions of British and Turkish football mixed.

He saw Souness plant an enormous red-and-gold flag in the centre circle at Fenerbahce’s Sukru Saracoglu stadium after Galatasaray had beaten their rivals to win the Turkish Cup in 1996. ‘He knew what that derby meant,’ said Tugay.

‘It is one of the biggest rivalries in the world and it doesn’t stop at the stadium gates. I don’t know what went through his head, but now it’s part of the history of the club. In Turkey, we can’t bear losing. Sometimes things go wrong because there’s so much passion. It’s how we’re brought up.’

Tugay was reared at the old Ali Sami Yen Stadium. It was demolished in 2010 as Galatasaray moved to the Turk Telekom Arena. The new place is nearly twice as big, but memories of the intimidating atmosphere at the old ground still send a tingle down the spine.

‘It was special,’ said Tugay. ‘The hairs would stand up on your arms. It was an atmosphere completely different to anywhere else. The new stadium looks like the Emirates, but the fans are the same and they still get behind their team, always.’

He was playing for Galatasaray in the infamous 0-0 draw in 1993 which knocked Manchester United out of the Champions League on away goals. United’s players claimed they were attacked by riot police sent to shield them from fans who lit flares and hurled missiles.

‘The police went to protect them, not to do harm,’ said Tugay and believes that victory was crucial to the development of the team — and Turkish football. ‘United were a big club, with big history. No-one gave us a chance. I remember reports afterwards about how United’s shares had gone down — the result caused financial damage.’

Souness, in charge at Galatasaray for the 1995-96 campaign, regrets missing the chance to develop Tugay’s generation. It would evolve to beat Arsenal in the UEFA Cup final in 2000 — although Tugay had joined Rangers by then — and many of those players formed the nucleus of the Turkey team that reached the 2002 World Cup semi-finals.

‘If you ask for my favourite memory it is always the World Cup,’ said Tugay. ‘To come so close was spectacular.’

When Turkey met England in the qualifiers for Euro 2004, it was another tense affair with players clashing in the tunnel after Tugay conceded a first-half penalty, which was missed by David Beckham.

By this time, after 18 months at Ibrox, Tugay was at Blackburn, again with Souness, who also signed Hakan Sukur, another Galatasaray star. Homesick Hakan was soon back in Istanbul, but Tugay spent eight years in East Lancashire with wife Etkin and their two children.

His football thrived in England with his understanding of the shape of the game around him and ability to control it.

‘When I moved to Blackburn, Souness told me to play simple and let everybody else do the running,’ he said. ‘Maybe this is why I stayed so long — but it was always one of my aims to be a manager.’

Tugay played until he was 38 and won 94 caps. When asked for the best he played with, he mentions Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke before settling on Romanian maestro Hagi. ‘He was a great person who never once hid behind his name,’ he said.

When Tugay quit playing in 2009, Hughes gave him a coaching role at Manchester City’s academy. Since then, he has coached in Turkey’s national academy as well as at Galatasaray.

If his next job is in Britain, he will be delighted. He holds a British passport and 19-year-old son Berke studies in London and daughter Melis, 11, was born in the city.

As a player, he always sought to model his style on Pep Guardiola. ‘How he ran, where he ran, the spaces he played in,’ said Tugay. ‘He played like a man with four eyes.’ If he emulates Guardiola’s coaching career as successfully as he did his playing style, this could be the start of something big.
