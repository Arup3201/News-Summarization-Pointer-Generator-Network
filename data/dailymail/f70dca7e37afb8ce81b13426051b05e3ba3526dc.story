Anthony Johnson has surprised himself with his scintillating form since returning to the UFC and is desperate for it to continue against Alexander Gustafsson.

Johnson was cut from the promotion almost three years ago after failing to make weight before losing to Vitor Belfort in Brazil.

But he returned this year with eye-catching victories over Phil Davis and Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and is now just one fight away from a meeting with champion Jon Jones.

'It's been an awesome year,' Johnson told Sportsmail. 'But I didn't expect to be in this position. I knew I would be somewhere but I didn't think I'd be where I am right now.

'But I knew my hard work would pay off.

'Deep down inside I've always known I had the talent to be the best so being in this situation doesn’t surprise me but I didn't think it would come so fast.'

Johnson revealed a heart-to-heart with his trainer after his defeat to Belfort set him on the road to his stunning renaissance.

Johnson was all smiles as he addressed the media earlier this week

'I'm a different person and a different fighter,' he said. 'I'm putting my heart into it now but back then I didn't. I pay attention now and a lot has changed.

'I didn't give it my all. I was going through the motions but now I make the best of the situation.

'Whenever I got cut from the UFC after fighting Vitor Belfort, I knew I had to get my act together. 'Me and my trainer were flying back from Brazil and we had a couple of cups of wine and started talking about what we were going to do.

'So far we've kept our word and things have been working out.

'We never wanted to put ourselves in the situation we were in in Brazil and really go out and show the world what we are about.'

Having struggled with his weight throughout his career, Johnson finally feels comfortable at light-heavyweight and is looking forward to showing he belongs with the best.

'He [Gustafsson] is one of the best and I think he should be fighting for the the title instead of Daniel Cormier but things happen for a reason and I'm glad that this fight is happening because it gives Sweden something to look forward to.

'Victory would mean everything and it would let me know where I belong. This is personal.'
