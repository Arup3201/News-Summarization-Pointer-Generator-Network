Those who decided to skip Black Friday shopping in favor of a trip to the Grand Canyon yesterday got to see the natural wonder from an extraordinary perspective.

Due to a rare weather phenomenon, the canyon's famous gorges were filled with a river of fog.

According to the national park's Facebook page, the fog was caused by something called a 'temperature inversion'. This happens when warm air acts as a lid to seal cool air near the ground. That means all pollution and fog is trapped and unable to rise.

Filling the abyss: The Grand Canyon's gorges were filled with fog Friday morning, creating quite the Kodak moment

Trapped: A temperature inversion is caused when warm air higher up creates a lid to trap cool air below, and all pollution and fog created near the ground

Kingdom in the clouds: According to park rangers, the fog was caused by a weather phenomenon called a 'temperature inversion'

Ranger Erin Whittaker told MailOnline
 that temperature inversions happen on average once or twice a year, but
 never producing such a picturesque full inversion.

Most
 of the inversions only fill up parts of the canyon, or occur on cloudy 
days. Yesterday's inversion happened against a perfectly clear blue sky,
 enveloping the entire canyon - an event Ranger Whittaker says happens 
about every 10 years.

Ranger
 Whittaker says some of the tourists visiting the canyon on the busy 
holiday weekend were disappointed they couldn't see the Colorado River 
below, and just figured it was a normal weather pattern.

Worth waiting for: Apparently park rangers wait years to see a temperature inversion happen in the canyon

Ocean of fog: While the weather caused the canyons to be covered up, many still turned out to photograph the event

But she and the other rangers tried to explain just how lucky they were to see the canyon  in a perfect inversion.

Once word spread, locals turned out to photograph the unusual view.

'Word spread like wildfire and 
most ran to the rim to photograph it. What a fantastic treat for all!'

Ranger
 Whittaker described it as being like a 'really awesome beach day' with 
all the locals leaving their posts to head to the beach to enjoy 
themselves.

A temperature inversion happens when hot air high up acts as a seal to keep cold air pollution and fog trapped below

While inversions happen once or twice a year at the Grand Canyon, a full inversion is more unusual, happening closer to every 10 years
