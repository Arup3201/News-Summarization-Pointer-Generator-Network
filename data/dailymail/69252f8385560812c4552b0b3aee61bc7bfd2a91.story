A Florida homecoming queen has been on the receiving end of a barrage of internet trolls this week and all because she has the misfortune to share the same name as the spoilt New Jersey teenager currently trying to sue her parents.

Rachel Canning, 22, attends the University of South Florida and apart from her name doesn’t share a lot in common with the 18-year-old high school student who has hit the headlines this week.

The two girls don’t especially look alike and have different colored hair, but that didn’t stop the USF Rachel having her Facebook account bombarded with hate-filled messages intended for the New Jersey teenager.

Rachel Canning, 22, attends the University of South Florida and apart from her name doesn't share a lot in common with the 18-year-old New Jersey high school student who has hit the headlines this week for suing her parents

A family court judge denied a request by Canning of Lincoln Park, New Jersey, to have her parents temporarily resume paying her tuition and living expenses. He set another hearing date for next month

On her way to a sorority chapter meeting on Monday evening, USF Rachel was surprised to find that she had 200 pending ‘follow’ requests for an account that she had previously only used last year when she was running for homecoming queen.

Very quickly her Facebook was filled with abusive messages from people she didn’t know and who were mistaking her for someone else.

‘At first, I thought, “What the heck?”’ Canning told the Tampa Bay Times.

‘I was more disturbed at the online bullying going on. Regardless, this girl's only 18. I couldn't believe there were full-grown adults that spent their day not only stalking this girl but sending bullying messages... I've never been on the receiving end of anything like that.’

The message that USF Canning posted to explain that she wasn't the infamous Rachel Canning of New Jersey was seen by more than 10,000 users

Some commenter used profanity, while others told her how terrible she was and that they wished she would get hit by a bus.

Canning, who was named USF homecoming queen in October, said her campaign Facebook page had previously got about three views a day.

By comparison, a message she posted to explain that she wasn’t the infamous Rachel Canning of New Jersey was seen by more than 10,000 users.

But rather than take all that negativity to heart, Canning has decided to put the spike in traffic to her Facebook page to a good cause.

In April Canning is set to participate in a fundraising walk for the advocacy group Autism Speaks and so she has posted a link to her fundraising page. Her 19-year-old brother, Thomas, has Asperger's syndrome.

'For Rachel to turn negative attention into something so positive shows what a great person and big sister she is,' said Katy Formella, Tampa Bay manager for Autism Speaks.

Boring? Rachel Canning appears to yawn while listening to how her family were torn apart by her claims and behavior

Sensational claims: Rachel Canning attends Morris County Court today in her school uniform. She is suing her parents Sean and Elizabeth for 'abandoning' her after she ran away after her 18th birthday

The New Jersey Rachel Canning came to 
the world's attention earlier this week when it was revealed that she 
was suing her parents to support her after she moved out of their home.

Her
 initial request was denied on Tuesday by a judge who cautioned that the
 case could lead to a 'potentially slippery slope' of claims by 
teenagers against their parents.

Canning
 had sought immediate relief in the form of $650 in weekly child support
 and the payment of the remainder of her tuition at Morris Catholic High
 School, as well as attorney's fees.

State
 Superior Court Judge Peter Bogaard denied those motions but ordered the
 parties to return to court on April 22, when they will present evidence
 and testimony on the over-arching question of whether the Cannings are 
obligated to financially support their daughter.

A
 high school senior, Canning has already been accepted by at least one 
college and is seeking to have her parents pay some or all of her 
tuition, attorney Tanya Helfand told Bogaard on Tuesday.

Dressed
 in her school uniform and with several friends in the gallery, Rachel 
Canning didn't speak to reporters after the hearing.

Bogaard
 sounded skeptical of some of the claims in the lawsuit, saying it could
 lead to teens 'thumbing their noses' at their parents, leaving home and
 then asking for financial support.

Blasted: The judge hearing the case took a very dim view of a voicemail 
Rachel left for 
her mother. She told her 'I hate you' and 'I wanna s*** all over your 
face'

Heartbreak:
 Elizabeth and Sean Canning broke down in tears as details of how their 
family was torn apart were read out publicly in Morris County Court, New
 Jersey

'Are
 we going to open the gates for 12-year-olds to sue for an Xbox? For 
13-year-olds to sue for an iPhone?' he asked. 'We should be mindful of a
 potentially slippery slope.'

Court documents show frequent causes of parent-teenage tension - boyfriends and alcohol - taken to an extreme.

In
 the filings, there are accusations and denials, but one thing is clear:
 the girl left home Oct. 30, two days before she turned 18 after a 
tumultuous stretch during which her parents separated and reconciled and
 the teen began getting into uncharacteristic trouble at school.

In
 court filings, Canning's parents, retired Lincoln Park police Chief 
Sean Canning and his wife, Elizabeth, said their daughter voluntarily 
left home because she didn't want to abide by reasonable household 
rules, such as being respectful, keeping a curfew, doing a few chores 
and ending a relationship with a boyfriend her parents say is a bad 
influence.

They say that shortly before she turned 18, she told her parents that she would be an adult and could do whatever she wanted.

She
 said her parents are abusive, contributed to an eating disorder she 
developed and pushed her to get a basketball scholarship.

Phone message left for Liz Canning from Rachel at July 2, 2013 1:18pm, submitted to Morris County Court, which got the judge apparently so angry:

'Hi
 mom just to let you know you're a real f**king winner aren't you you 
think you're so cool and you think you caught me throwing up in the 
bathroom after eating an egg frittatta, yeah sorry that you have 
problems now and you need to harp on mine because i didn't and i 
actually took a s*** which i really just wanna s*** all over your face 
right now because it looks like that anyway, anyway i f***ing hate you 
and um I've written you off so don't talk to me, don't do anything I'm 
blocking you from just about everything, have a nice life, bye mom'

Dim view: The judge denied her request for any immediate financial costs to be paid and warned Rachel that her request would probably be turned down on the evidence she has provided so far

Pained: Rachel's parents owe more than $5,000 on her school fees, but are refusing to pay, saying that she had 'emancipated' herself from their care

They
 say they were supportive, helped her through the eating disorder and 
paid for her to go to a private school where she would not get as much 
playing time in basketball as she would have at a public school.

Helfand
 told Bogaard in court on Tuesday that Rachel Canning learned her 
behavior from her parents, particularly her mother, with whom she has a 
difficult relationship.

'These
 people who call themselves loving parents paint the most disgusting 
portrait of their daughter' in the court filings, she said. 'They are 
pointing the finger to avoid their parental responsibilities.'

A
 cheerleader and lacrosse player who hopes to become a biomedical 
engineer, Canning wants the judge to declare that she's non-emancipated 
and dependent as a student on her parents for support

Attorney
 Laurie Rush-Masuret, representing the Canning parents, called Rachel 
Canning's claims 'outrageous' and said that by leaving - and by the fact
 that she is 18 - Rachel Canning 'emancipated herself' and shouldn't 
count on her parents' support.

'There is no abuse. There is no neglect,' she said. 'They are not unfit parents. She could come home tonight.'

Rachel
 Canning has been living in Rockaway Township with the family of her 
best friend. The friend's father, former Morris County Freeholder John 
Inglesino, is paying for the lawsuit.

Mother
 and daughter: Rachel further claimed in court papers that her mother 
Liz called her 'porky' and that Rachel went on to suffer from bulimia. 
Mrs Canning said this is not true and she supported her
