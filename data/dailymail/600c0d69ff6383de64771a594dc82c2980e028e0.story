Atletico Madrid are considering a move for Manchester United midfielder Shinji Kagawa.

The Spanish champions are rebuilding their squad this summer and Kagawa, who is one of those players Louis van Gaal is prepared to discard at Old Trafford, has emerged as a target for Atletico manager Diego Simeone.

Kagawa, 25, is viewed by Atletico as an alternative to Arsenal's Santi Cazorla.

The Japanese international arrived at Old Trafford from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2012 but he has struggled to nail down a place in the first-team and has only offered sporadic glimpses of his qualities.

Van Gaal has already outlined his belief that the United squad is excessively stocked in Kagawa's preferred No. 10 position and it is understood that Juan Mata, Wayne Rooney and Adnan Januzaj all ahead of him in the pecking order.

Kagawa has been frustrated by the failure of both Sir Alex Ferguson and David Moyes to hand him an extended run in his favoured role behind the forward and he has previously spoke of his reluctance to play from the wide positions.

Moyes, for his part, argued that Kagawa has been effective playing from the left for  the Japanese national team.

Nonetheless, with Van Gaal's new 3-5-2 system, the only slot for Kagawa would be in the role that Juan Mata will primarily occupy, with Kagawa too slight to play in a wing-back role.

German side Wolfsburg are also monitoring Kagawa and they have previously registered an interest in a player that could be available for around £13million.

Borussia Dortmund are not currently prioritising a move to take Kagawa back to Germany but manager Jurgen Klopp remains an admirer and could be tempted into the race, particularly with the future of Marco Reus remaining unclear.
