Tennis commentator Barry Cowan has got under Andy Murray’s skin again – by knocking his mum Judy out of the Guinness Book of World Records.

Cowan, who once took Pete Sampras to five sets at Wimbledon, had his world record for holding the largest-ever tennis coaching session ratified by the Guinness authorities on Tuesday.

Beaten: Judy Murray is no longer the record holder for the largest-ever tennis coaching session

He and his fellow trainers simultaneously coached 680 children in Liverpool before the city’s Hope International tournament last month, surpassing the previous highest of 406 trained by Judy in New York earlier this year.

If anyone was going to be miffed about his mother losing her record to 39-year-old Cowan, it will be the 2013 Wimbledon champion.

Murray has not failed to disguise his irritation with Cowan in the past and sent a scathing tweet about his work on Sky Sports during a match between Rafael Nadal and Thomas Berdych in Italy last year: ‘Was pumped 2 watch nadal berdych but barry cowans commentating has killed match..poor guy has no idea what’s happening #clueless”

Cowan had previously said the Scot had to play more aggressively to win Grand Slam events.

The coaching record, which will now appear in the renowned Guinness Book of World Records, was set in Liverpool on June 18 when organisers invited local schools to take part in the mass training session under Cowan’s charge.

Tournament chief Anders Borg was delighted the record has been accepted.

‘It is now official. 680 kids from Liverpool schools can now say they are part of a world record. Barry was in charge of the coaching team.’

Cowan, who was born in Southport and is a lifelong Liverpool fan, reached a career high of 162 in his tennis career and took Sampras the full distance in his most famous match on Court One in 2001.

He has since developed  a reputation for being an opinionated but knowledgeable pundit on television including Sky Sports.
