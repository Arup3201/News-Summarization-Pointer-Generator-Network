There were many who doubted Alastair Cook could repeat his achievement in India in turning a 1-0 deficit into a 2-1 Test series lead, including at least six former England captains, but Peter Moores was not among them.

The extraordinary fourth Test victory, England’s first within three days against India since 1967, was a triumph for a captain on the end of fierce criticism after the low of Lord’s and a coach in Moores who had much to prove.

The bitter aftermath of the worst winter in England’s history increased the pressure on Cook and Moores but, finally, after the most searching examination, a new era brimming with promising talent looks close to glorious fruition.

‘The significant point was when Alastair came out and said he was in it for the long haul,’ said Moores when asked how England had recovered under Cook from the rock bottom of their second Test capitulation to twice thrash India.

‘He still wanted to do the job. If other people didn’t want him then fine, he’d move on, but he made public his desire to captain England. The more criticism he got the steelier he got, more determined. He’s that sort of character.

‘I think he honestly said, when people were questioning him, that he would give it everything he had and he’s still got the same approach. He’s developing quickly tactically as a captain and he has great values. 

'There is nothing Alastair wouldn’t do for England or for the team. And that’s a good place to start.’

Privately, the England hierarchy have always been adamant that Cook was going nowhere, not even, they insist, if that defeat at Lord’s had been followed by another in Southampton. Yet Paul Downton, the new managing director whose belief in Cook and Moores has never wavered, did not have to worry about that.

This Investec series is not won yet but such was the spineless surrender of India at Old Trafford, when salvation in the form of Hurricane Bertha was just around the corner, that it is difficult to see them possibly recovering at The Oval.

Stumping up: Cook leads the applause following the final wicket

Another victory in the final Test would cement Cook as captain for next year’s Ashes, with England’s next Test cricket not coming until April in the Caribbean, of an exciting team who just needed to turn that potential into tangible success.

Did Moores, in his second coming as coach, ever doubt his captain? ‘No, because when you are close to somebody you get an idea of their will to do the job,’ said Moores. ‘He would openly admit that he’s had a really rough ride but that can sometimes forge somebody into something special.

‘Leadership is about getting people to follow you and creating opportunities for them. Cooky is very much into that. Deep down, he is a real carer as a bloke. He wants the team to grow. 

'That’s why it’s exciting, there are chances for all these young players coming in. There will be some changes as we go along but hopefully the leader is not someone you want to change too often.’

While England are on the up India have descended from a position where they could have claimed an historic series win on these shores to an absolute rabble under a captain in MS Dhoni who just did not look interested on Saturday.

Dhoni’s hopeless slog to gift Moeen Ali one of his four wickets, as nine in all fell after tea on the third day in just 132 balls, summed up an India side who have appeared to lose focus ever since Dhoni became obsessed with trying to get Jimmy Anderson banned for the rest of the series.

The India captain must have known bad weather was on the way to Manchester yesterday and tomorrow yet he showed a complete lack of discipline.

England’s startling recovery should be placed in the context of India’s fecklessness at the Ageas Bowl and in Manchester but it is also worth pointing out that the home side finally got the pitch at Old Trafford, with pace and carry, they have craved all season. 

It is no exaggeration to say that England would probably have won all their Tests this season if the pitches had replicated the one produced by Matt Merchant. Can it really be so hard for groundsmen?

‘That was one of the best cricket pitches I’ve seen for a very long time,’ said Moores of his old stamping ground. ‘It had something for everyone.’

For now it has helped restore the smile on the face of English cricket.
