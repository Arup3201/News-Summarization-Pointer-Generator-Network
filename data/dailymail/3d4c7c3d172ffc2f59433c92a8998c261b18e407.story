Fabricio Coloccini will miss the Tyne-Wear derby next month, after his appeal against a red card picked up against Everton this week was rejected. 

The defender was sent off following a lunge on Aaron Lennon in the second half and immediately hit with a three-game ban, ruling him out of the trip to the Stadium of Light on Easter Sunday.

And the FA's Indpendent Regulatory Commission decided to reject his claim for wrongful dismissal, keeping him out until April 19.

United had felt they had a case for overturning the dismissal but their appeal fell on deaf ears on Tuesday.

The club are now left with just one fit centre-back – Mike Williamson – for the games against Arsenal, Sunderland and Liverpool.
