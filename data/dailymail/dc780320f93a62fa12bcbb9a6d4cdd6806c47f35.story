Deaths from some of the most common cancers have dropped by a third in the last 20 years, the latest figures show.

Rates of death caused by breast, bowel, lung and prostate cancer combined fell by 30 per cent overall, according to Cancer Research UK.

These cancers account for almost half of the 160,000 cancer deaths in the UK each year.

The charity says research, leading to innovative drugs and other forms of treatment, is responsible for more patients beating the disease.

Earlier diagnosis has helped boost survival rates, but there have also been major advances in surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Death rates for breast cancer fell by 38 per cent, bowel cancer by 34 per cent, lung cancer by 27 per cent and prostate cancer by 21 per cent in 2010-2012 compared with 1991-1993.

The data shows around 15,000 people died from breast cancer 20 years ago compared with 11,600 now.

Scientists have improved detection of the disease through screening and more effective treatments - such as more effective forms of surgery and radiotherapy, along with hormonal drugs.

Today almost 3,000 fewer people a year die from bowel cancer than 20 years ago, while recently introduced screening is likely to bring death rates down further through earlier diagnosis.

But a fall of 3,000 lung cancer deaths over the last two decades has masked rising rates among women smokers.

Prostate cancer survival in the UK has doubled in the last 40 years with half of those diagnosed with cancer living for at least 10 years.

But some cancers have not made the same progress, with death rates in liver, pancreatic, melanoma, oral and some digestive cancers all increasing.

Despite improvements, cancer survival rates in Britain still lag well behind those in other European countries.

A major study of 29 countries found that the UK was on a par with Slovenia, Czech Republic and Estonia far below France, Germany and Scandinavia.

Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK’s chief executive, said ‘Research continues to help save lives from cancer, and these figures offer renewed encouragement that progress continues.

‘The UK remains a world leader in cancer research, responsible for many of the breakthroughs that have reduced the impact of cancer.

‘But while the death rate for the four biggest cancer killers falls, it’s vital to remember that more needs to be done to help bring even better results over the coming years.

‘There are over 200 different forms of the disease. For some of these, the advances are less impressive, such as pancreatic, oesophageal and liver cancer.

‘Far too many lives continue to be affected by the disease. We’re determined that the research we fund will help save more lives, developing better, kinder treatments which will beat cancer sooner.’

Mother of two Nicola Bourne from Harpenden was just 31 when she was diagnosed with advanced bowel cancer in 2012.

She had intensive chemotherapy and radiotherapy to shrink the tumour, a 12 hour operation to remove it and then a further course of chemo finally finishing on Christmas Eve 2012.

Nicola’s mother had died from bowel cancer three years earlier after enduring six years of gruelling treatment – which the young mother was dreading.

‘I expected the worst but almost everything about the treatment had changed’ she said.

‘You could just see how much it had improved from when I went through it with mum. While my mother had chemo in the hospital I could take a pill at home.

‘The difference in how cancer care and treatment had moved on in 10 years was phenomenal – thanks to research I’m incredibly optimistic that in another 10 years things will have got even better.

‘Soon after my mother was diagnosed, my grandmother realised she’d been having similar symptoms and she too was diagnosed with bowel cancer.

‘But unfortunately it was too late for treatment and she died aged 69. When I was referred for genetic counselling I discovered my great grandfather had died from the same thing making four generations affected by the same cancer.’
