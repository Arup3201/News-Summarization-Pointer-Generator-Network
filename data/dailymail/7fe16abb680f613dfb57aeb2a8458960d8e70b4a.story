It takes a lot to steal the show from the notoriously flamboyant Eurovision entries, but this Swedish sign language interpreter's energetic moves and expressive gestures have managed to do just that.

Tommy Krångh has become an overnight sensation in Sweden after putting on the performance of his life, interpreting pop singer Magnus Carlsson's attempt to enter Eurovision.

But while Carlsson's upbeat tune may have failed to impress audiences in the Scandinavian country, being voted ninth out of 12 entries vying to represent at the annual competition, many are now calling for 48-year-old Krångh to take the stage for Sweden in Vienna this May.

Clicks: But while Carlsson's song only came ninth out of 12 entries, it has been shared thousands of times

Shared: And it is all down to Krångh's exuberant interpretation - complete with hip wiggles

The video of Krångh's exuberant interpretation has been shared thousands of times in Sweden, and across the world.

The delighted interpreter has told Swedish newspapers he was 'thrilled' with the reaction - and has been 'love-bombed' on Twitter by people who enjoyed his energetic performance, even getting the odd marriage proposal.

'It´s been absolutely amazing,' he told MailOnline. 

'I´ve been love-bombed from a thousands of people. People are even proposing to marry me. This is something I could never imagine. 

'It's a once in lifetime experience after being a signer for so many years. I love that sign language gets so much attention at the moment.' 

Hilarious: Krångh says he has been 'love-bombed' on social media since the show went out

Interpretation: He hopes his translation enables deaf people to get the 'feel' of the song

Water cooler: He wants deaf people to be able to discuss the song at work just like their hearing colleages

Krångh told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet he 'just get funky and let go' when he got up on stage.

Speaking to MailOnline, he added: 'The music is a part of your entire body.

'That is the charming thing with sign language it is so expressive and when you hear the music you basically freak out and loose yourself.'

Meanwhile, he revealed that his aim is to ensure deaf people could grasp the message the singer was trying to convey.

'We get the songs a few weeks before the contest and then its up to you to analyze the song,' he explained. 

'What is the message, if there is a message for that matter, what does the artist want with the song. How do you get into the rhythm and so forth. 

'The important thing is that people who can´t hear is suppose to get the same experience as people who can. 

'They should be able to have an opinion about the song, just like everyone else.' 

Future: It is not clear whether Krångh is going to be the interpreter for this year's Swedish entry yet

Entry: Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw, who won the public vote

Top marks: However, it seems the Swedish public would give 'dix points' if Krångh is the interpreter

It is not yet clear whether Krångh will be heading to Vienna as the official sign language interpreter. 

Sweden is going to be represented by Måns Zelmerlöw this year, and he will no doubt be hoping to take home the trophy.

But it seems the Swedes might be a little sad if Krångh doesn't make an appearance. 

'I know that Måns will make us proud in Vienna, but I would not say no if I was asked,' he told MailOnline. 

'Perhaps we could both be on stage,' added Krångh, who also revealed his 'dream artist' to work with would be Celine Dion.

Krångh is not the first Swedish interpreter to capture the imagination of the nation.

The last time Sweden won Eurovision three years ago with Euphoria, by Loreen, an interpreter managed to steal a bit of the limelight from the main act.

Precedent: This sign language interpretation was also a hit three years ago

Trophy: That year's winner, Euphoria, by Loreen, came complete with an emotive interpretation
