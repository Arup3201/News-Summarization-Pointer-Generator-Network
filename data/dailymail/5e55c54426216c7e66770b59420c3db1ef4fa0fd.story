More than £30billion was wiped off the value of Britain’s leading companies as world stock markets tumbled yesterday.

The FTSE 100 index fell 130.64 points or 2 per cent to 6417.16 in London, reducing the value of UK blue-chip firms by £33.2billion in a blow to millions of savers.

Milan’s stock market was down 940 points, or 4.92 per cent, and shares in Athens fell 5.63 per cent.

The dramatic sell-off came as fears that Greece will abandon the euro sent shockwaves through the markets.

Speculation is also mounting that the European Central Bank is preparing to flood the eurozone with newly created money through quantitative easing, in a bid to stave off recession.

The combination sent the single currency to a nine-year low against the US dollar.

Dr Dennis Novy, an associate professor of economics at the University of Warwick, said: ‘The eurozone economy has been in the doldrums for years now. Markets are expecting the euro to become weaker.’

A snap general election has been called in Greece for January 25 - opening the door to the Left-wing Syriza party, which is ahead in polls and has vowed to tear up the nation’s £188billion bailout agreement. It is feared this could lead to a euro exit.

German magazine Der Spiegel reported that Berlin considers Greece quitting the euro almost unavoidable if Syriza seizes power - a report Germany’s government denied.

Carsten Brzeski, chief economist at banking group ING, said: ‘It would be a nasty precedent if Greece leaves as it could stimulate others to do the same, making it the first step of euro fragmentation.

‘The fact remains that losing one member of the family would ultimately open Pandora’s box.’

French President Francois Hollande yesterday said it is ‘up to the Greeks’ to decide whether to remain part of the single currency.

‘As for Greece remaining in the eurozone, Greece alone can decide,’ said Mr Hollande. ‘The Greeks are free to determine their own destiny.’

Analysts said talk of a Greek exit triggered heavy selling in stock markets across Europe.

Alastair McCaig, a market analyst at trading firm IG, said: ‘Trading screens are a sea of red as talk of a Greek exit from the eurozone drives equity markets lower.

‘We are now entering what could be the final chapter of the Greek saga, in which the indebted nation breaks free from the single currency and tries to go it alone.

‘The rise of the anti-austerity Syriza party has sent shivers down the spine of dealers as they are well positioned for the election this month.

‘A victory for the left-wing party does not automatically mean a Greek exit but traders will certainly see it that way.’

Asda knocked 2p off the price of fuel yesterday, saying it will charge no more than 105.7p a litre for petrol and 112.7p for diesel from today. Morrisons, Sainsbury’s and Tesco swiftly cut their prices.
