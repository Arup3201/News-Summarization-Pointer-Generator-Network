Disney has announced huge profits from its movie studios, the same day it confirmed that the Toy Story franchise will return to cinemas in 2017 with a fourth installment.

Pictures such as Frozen, as well as hits from its Marvel Studios subsidiary including The Avengers, Iron Man 3 and Guardians of the Galaxy, made an average of $1billion in global box office receipts, the company's CEO said.

Bob Iger talked up the media company's studio successes during an earnings conference Thursday, the same day he announced that Toy Story creator John Lasseter would return to direct the fourth movie in the beloved franchise.

Update: The new film, featuring tablets where in the 1995 original there was only Etch-a-Sketch, is set for studio release in 2017, and will be directed by creator John Lasseter

However, while Disney's film successes impressed, other holdings including the ABC and ESPN cable networks and other media interests dampened optimism, with the result of an overall drop in the company's share price.

Disney's value dipped one per cent yesterday, after announced figures for cable earnings fell short of predictions,CNBC reported.

But financial results will do little to halt the enthusiasm around the latest Toy Story film.

In a separate announcement, Iger welcomed back John Lasseter, who wrote the story for all three films and directed the first two.

He said: 'John created Toy Story and directed its first two films and it's great to have him back directing one of our most valuable properties.'

Marvelous: Disney's acquisition of Marvel Studios is paying dividends, with billion-dollar profits from films like Marvel's The Avengers, as well as separate films starring Captain America (Christopher Evans, center), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr, right) and Thor (Chris Hemsworth, second from left)

Lasseter himself said the film will 'open a new chapter' in the lives of its main characters, Woody the cowboy and space ranger Buzz Lightyear.

The original 1995 film was the first fully computer-animated feature-length film, and made $361million at the box office. Sequels followed with 1999's Toy Story 2, and the much-anticipated Toy Story 3 in 2010.

Good news in the movie business comes at a challenging time. Movie studios, TV networks and cable and satellite providers alike are grappling with a changing media industry as more people watch TV and movies online and via streaming services like Netflix and Hulu.

HBO made waves recently by saying it would offer a standalone streaming service late next year.

Some have speculated that Disney's ESPN network may do the same - but Iger batted away the idea, saying that cable channel bundles are still the best choice for consumers.

He said there are 101 million households with a cable or satellite subscription in the U.S., down  from 101.5 million last year.

He said: 'While clearly the economy has had some impact over the last few years and we do see the millennials seem to be becoming subscribers a little bit later than perhaps they used to, we just feel that when you look at the quality of what's offered, meaning the number channels in the programming across those channels, and you consider the price, that is likely to remain dominant for a long time.'

He added that he didn't think there is a need to create a standalone ESPN streaming service since that might erode the popularity of cable bundles.

'To do it at a point where you are endangering your own business model which is already facing a fair amount of challenge because of all the changing dynamics of the media landscape, it doesn't make sense to us right now,' he said.

Disney Studios had the strongest results among the media company's divisions.

Revenue in that unit climbed 18 per cent to $1.78 billion, with growth both in theatrical distribution due to Maleficent and Guardians of the Galaxy and home entertainment thanks to Frozen and Captain America.

Other segments reported higher revenue as well. The Burbank, California company said revenue from media and cable networks rose 5 per cent to $5.22 billion.

Revenue from parks and resorts rose 7 per cent to $4 billion. Consumer product revenue rose 7 per cent to $1.07 billion.

Overall revenue rose 7 per cent to $12.39 billion, ahead of expectations of $12.36 billion.

Fourth-quarter net income rose 8 per cent to $1.5 billion, or 87 cents per share. Excluding one-time items, net income matched analyst expectations of 89 cents per share.

The stock dipped less than 2 percent after-hours, having closed at an all-time high of $92 before the report. The stock has been on a dramatic run, nearly doubling in the last two years.
