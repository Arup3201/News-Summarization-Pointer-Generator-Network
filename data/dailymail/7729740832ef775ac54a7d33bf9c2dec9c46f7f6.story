When you go clothes shopping, what do you look for? Most of us, if we’re honest, would say that an item’s price (closely followed by quality and fit) trumps ethical concerns about where, how and by whom it was made.

Indeed, across the High Street, sales of ethical clothing have fallen thanks to their perceived high cost — Fairtrade cotton sales fell from 18 million items to 12 million between 2009 and 2010.

But ethics were thrust into the spotlight again last week when a customer found a ‘hidden’ message sewn into a £10 Primark dress by what appeared to be a factory worker, reading: ‘Forced to work exhausting hours’.

Troubling: Rebecca Gallagher, 25, discovered the hand-stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a Primark sundress

Hidden message: The hand-stitched note reads 'Forced to work exhausting hours'

Rebecca Gallagher, 25, discovered the hand-stitched protest sewn in next to the washing instructions of a floral sundress she bought in South Wales.

Primark claims ignorance of how it got there, saying there have been ‘no other incidents’, but it raises troubling questions.

So, where can you buy clothes without abandoning your morals, harming the environment or paying a fortune?

While numerous small companies sell genuinely Fairtrade and ethical fashion, such as fashion-conscience.com, ethicalsuperstore.com and stylewithheart.com, it is High Street stores that have the real power to make a change.

You will find buzzwords such as ‘sustainability’, ‘fair practice’ and ‘ethical’ scattered liberally across store websites. But finding out which companies live up to their promises is difficult, says Tamsin Lejeune, managing director and founder of the Ethical Fashion Forum, the main industry organisation for sustainable fashion.

‘Certain companies are getting pretty serious about the supply chain,’ she says. ‘But every company tends to have its own standard.’

Still, if you know where to look — and what to look for — there are places where you can buy clothes with a clear conscience.  

On the High Street: Many of us don't consider ethical concerns when shopping at chains such as Primark

High Street giant H&M is one of the best, despite its cheap prices. Its Conscious Collection offers affordable basics in eco-friendly fabrics, such as a shirt dress for £29.99 in Tencel(made of wood pulp), organic cotton-blend vests for £4.99 and jeans made from partly recycled material for £29.99.

H&M regularly comes top of industry surveys on sustainability, and has pioneered the use of fabrics such as organic leather and recycled wool. It also features Clevercare labels, encouraging the customer to save energy by washing clothes at lower temperatures, and offers to recycle old clothes.

Online giant Asos is another pioneer with Asos Africa, an ethical line made in Kenya which uses local fabrics: this season’s standouts include a £35 mesh maxi-dress and a beautiful £12 zebra-print scarf. 

Zara is another good bet, as it has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative. The campaign group Labour Behind The Label (LBL) also found in a report that Zara was in the process of raising workers’ wages to meet a ‘living wage’ benchmark.

LBL spokeswoman Hannah Smith says: ‘Most people making our clothes have to choose between buying shoes for their children and having dinner. Doubling the wage of workers who make a T-shirt can cost as little as 20p per shirt — but most brands aren’t prepared to forgo even a fraction of their enormous profits.’

The report gives a very low ethical rating to brands including Armani, Versace, Hugo Boss and Gucci, based on lack of transparency and the number of subcontractors and indirect employees, who may not have as many workers’ rights.

Marks & Spencer is another winner, though. It aims for workers in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India to be paid a living wage by 2015, and has strict animal welfare rules in its tanneries, refusing to sell wool from sheep that have been mulesed (a technique to prevent maggot infestation by cutting away skin near the tail, often without anaesthetic). It uses organic and Fairtrade cotton and wool in many items, from £5 vests to wool men’s suits at £349.

Ethical hit: Dress by H&M

And its Shwopping initiative with Oxfam aims to reduce the number of clothes going to landfill — a billion items a year in the UK.

While some stores quietly offer small lines of organic or Fairtrade T-shirts — including Laura Ashley, from about £20, and Gap, which has organic cotton childrenswear — it is at department stores that you may be most able to make informed choices.

John Lewis is aiming to increase its British suppliers by 15 per cent next year and stocks brands such as Seasalt, a Cornish company that specialises in Soil Association-certified organic cotton, with Duchess of Cambridge-worthy Breton tops for £29.95.

House of Fraser, meanwhile, stocks People Tree, the Fairtrade fashion pioneer beloved by Livia Firth and Emma Watson, which has dresses from about £45, with Orla Kiely-designed frocks from £75.

Even without the labels of ‘organic’ and Fairtrade, you can buy more responsibly on the High Street. Take jeans: producing a  single pair uses 11,000 litres of water during manufacture, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature, polluting  rivers in countries such as China with mercury, cadmium and lead. That makes Levi’s a good buy: they have signed  up to the Better Cotton Initiative and come up with a technique for washing denim in recycled water.

Buying ethical does mean savvy shopping and sometimes paying a little more. But surely it’s worth it — after all, for every bargain basement dress someone, somewhere, might be paying a heavy price.
