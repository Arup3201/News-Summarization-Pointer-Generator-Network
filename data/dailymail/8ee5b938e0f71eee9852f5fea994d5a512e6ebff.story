The Rail Minister shamed into giving up his chauffeur-driven car following a public outcry is back  in his Government limo – after finding the daily commute by train too gruelling.

Simon Burns is risking the wrath of David Cameron by using his £80,000-a-year official car to travel to Westminster.

The Mail on Sunday revealed  earlier this year that Mr Burns was picked up from his constituency home in Essex every morning, driven the 35 miles to his Westminster office and dropped back home again in the evening. The disclosure triggered a furious reaction from commuter groups.

At it again: Rail minister Simon Burns, MP arrives for work at the House of Commons in his chauffeur driven car

Off road: Mr Burns is pictured on the train journey from Chelmsford into London

Downing Street ordered Mr Burns, who is responsible for ‘rail strategy’ and ‘fares policy’, to take the train instead, and the Minister joined other commuters from Chelmsford station.

He was pictured looking miserable as he failed to find a seat and stood swaying in the ‘vestibule’ area between carriages in a packed train.

However, at 7am on Thursday, Mr Burns was photographed arriving at the House of Commons in the comfort of the back seat of his Toyota Avensis.

Whitehall sources say the 60-year-old chain-smoking Oxford graduate, who is a cousin of rock star David Bowie, now usually stays in London from Monday to Thursday and goes back to his constituency only at weekends.

He is collected from his new base in the capital each morning in his official Toyota Avensis and taken either to his MP’s office in the  Commons or his ministerial office in the Department for Transport.

Controversy: How the Mail On Sunday broke the story that Simon Burns was taking an £80,000 limo to work back in January

Contrast: Transport Minister Norman Baker (centre) takes the train twice a week on the 120-mile round trip to his Lewes constituency, and otherwise travels from his London home to his office on foot or bus

The driver also frequently ferries him between the two offices, which are just one third of a mile apart.

The
Avensis, one of two pool cars used by the department, costs the 
taxpayer an annual £80,000, including driver salary, maintenance and 
other costs.

The
revelation is likely to add to the Government’s embarrassment over MPs’
perks, following a storm of protest over last week’s proposal that they
should receive a bumper pay rise of £7,400.  

And, worryingly for Mr Burns, it comes just days before Mr Cameron prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks.

Bad timing: Worryingly for Mr Burns, it comes just days before David Cameron prepares to announce a reshuffle of his ministerial ranks

Friends of Mr Burns say that  he found it impossible to work on the trains between Chelmsford  and London.

When
this newspaper initially disclosed Mr Burns’ travel arrangements in 
January, he argued that he was barred by official rules from working on 
confidential papers on the train. The claim was denied by the Cabinet 
Office.

In contrast, fellow Transport Minister Stephen Hammond usually uses public transport to travel the eight miles to his Wimbledon home, while Liberal Democrat Under-Secretary Norman Baker takes the train twice a week on the 120-mile round trip to his Lewes constituency, and otherwise travels from his London home to his office on foot or bus.

Labour MP Fabian Hamilton said: ‘I think it is a shame that the Rail Minister doesn’t seem keen to use the railways. He is responsible for the quality of the journey endured by commuters, but will not stoop to join them.’

And David Brigg, chairman of commuter group the Witham and Braintree Rail Users Association, said: ‘How can we go to the local MP, who also happens to be the Rail Minister, about commuting problems if he is not experiencing the same  trials and tribulations of the journey into London as us?’

Sources close to Mr Burns said he would not be claiming for the cost of his London accommodation on expenses, and added that when he travelled between the constituency and Westminster at weekends, he either drove himself or took the train.

A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘Simon Burns regularly uses trains, including to and from his constituency.

As an MP he has always spent nights in London, particularly when Parliament is sitting late. Any night in the capital comes at no expense to the taxpayer.’
