The general consensus is that this year's Chelsea Flower Show was one of the best ever, with a clutch of talented young designers injecting extra energy and brio into the 101-year-old event.

Purple, magenta and claret were the dominant colours, closely followed by blue, while softly swaying grasses and umbellifers were interspersed with perennials to gorgeous effect. If you've been inspired to recreate some of that Chelsea magic in your own garden, here are some of the key plants from this year's show.

Tall, graceful Iris sibirica (see main picture; available from www.woottens plants.com) cropped up in many of the show gardens, most strikingly in the immaculate gold-medal-winning Italian-inspired garden by Tommaso del Buono and Paul Gazerwitz, where the blue flowers contrasted beautifully with lime-green euphorbias and box hedging. Iris sibirica thrive in sun or shade, need no staking, and also come in luscious shades of purple, white or yellow. 

Iris siberica thrive in sun or shade so are fairly low maintenance

Their garden also used Anchusa azurea 'Loddon Royalist', which has one of the most intense blues of any summer-flowering plant. The flowers, rather similar to forget-me-nots, are held on upright stems and set off by coarse, rather hairy leaves. This perennial, which needs free-draining soil and is fairly short-lived, is available from www.hardys-plants.co.uk.

The youngest ever winner of a show garden gold medal, 27-year-old  Hugo Bugg, made a big impression with the Royal Bank of Canada garden. He used plenty of the deep-crimson loosestrife, Lysimachia atropurpurea 'Beaujolais', and with its silvery foliage and very small, pineapple-shaped flowers, this perennial is an absolute stunner. Lysimachia is available from www.crocus.co.uk, or it can be grown from seed in spring.

The Laurent Perrier garden, which won Best in Show, featured graceful planting of foxgloves, verbascums and aconites interspersed with the buttery-yellow lupin, Lupinus 'Chandelier' (available from www.claire austin-hardyplants.co.uk). Lupins – magenta ones this time – also popped up in the exuberant Stoke-on-Trent show garden, confirming that this humble cottage garden favourite is now the height of fashion.

Orlaya grandiflora, or white laceflower, is a hardy annual with ferny flowers and flat umbels of pure white flowers throughout the summer. It's a great plant to use in a romantic, airy design and it was used to great effect in the Cloudy Bay garden, which won a silver-gilt medal. Seeds are available from www.chilternseeds.co.uk.

The graceful Gladiolus communis subsp. byzantinus was used in several show gardens and on the Avon Bulbs stand in the marquee, which won a gold medal. This gladiolus is a world away from the familiar florist's gladiolus; it's a slender plant with sword-shaped leaves and reddish-purple, funnel-shaped flowers that bloom throughout summer. Available from www.avonbulbs.co.uk.

Although several new roses were launched at Chelsea, one of the most striking varieties on show is actually a couple of years old. Rosa 'Boscobel', bred by David Austin (www.david austinroses.co.uk) has buds that start off as red before opening to a rich salmon colour. The unusual colour made it a hit with designers, and it looks set to become a classic.
