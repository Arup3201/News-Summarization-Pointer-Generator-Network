Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez ran the show for Chile as one of last summer's most impressive teams continued their good form against Peru.

Sanchez, bossing the game from his role behind the striker, created several chances throughout the game, and hit the cross-bar with a near-perfect free kick.

Most crucially, the playmaker helped break down a stubborn Peruvian defence with a magical assist in the 27th minute.

It is clear to see how much Vargas' two goals mean to him as he secured a confidence boosting win for Chile

Former Cardiff midfielder Gary Medel scored Chile's second before Vargas rounded off the win in the second half with an excellent volley following a well-worked corner.

The match was also notable for Barcelona goalkeeper Claudio Bravo becoming Chile's most capped player.

The 31-year-old won his 85th cap for his country, and was reasonably comfortable in keeping a clean sheet, as Jorge Sampaoli's side stepped up their Copa America preparations.
