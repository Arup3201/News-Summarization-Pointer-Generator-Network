The advert for a 'customer-facing passenger assistant' has been criticised as 'gobbledegook' (file picture)

The job adverts for a ‘passenger 
assistant’ stressed that a ‘good face-to-face communicator’ was required
 who must have ‘customer-facing experience’.

Not to mention having a ‘natural flair for going the extra mile’ and being fit enough to stand for lengthy periods.

In other words, a bus conductor.

Candidates were further informed that 
they would work on a ‘unique’ new double-decker bus which was 
‘accessible’ and ‘convenient’ and asked if they had ‘the kind of 
personality that made last year’s Olympic gamesmakers so successful’.

The Plain English Campaign – which promotes concise writing – summed up the ads as ‘gobbledegook’.

A spokesman said: ‘What seems like a 
great idea is certainly getting lost in translation here. “Wanted – 
helpful bus conductor” would seem a lot clearer.’

The Go-Ahead London bus company placed
 the ads in newspapers and on the internet.

‘The primary role of the 
passenger assistant is to travel the length of the route and ensure that
 passengers board and alight the bus safely,’ said an online 
description.

‘As part of the role it’s your 
responsibility to be visible to passengers by patrolling both the lower 
and upper deck and be proactive in assisting with general inquiries.’

The advert calls for applicants with the 'same kind of personality' as the London 2012 gamesmakers

The Plain English spokesman added: 
‘The prospective clippie must now undertake “routine patrols” and be a 
“visible presence” – which of course makes us wonder what fun it would 
be to be an invisible presence instead.’

A Go-Ahead London spokesman said: ‘We have reviewed our advert and are happy with the content.

‘The advert has been successful and has generated a very large number of applications.’

Boris Johnson previously won an award for his 'cyclised city' comment

NHS Trusts, councils, politicians and even sportspeople have been mocked by The Plain English Campaign for their awkward use of English.

The organisation holds an annual awards for the most baffling and awkward statements.

Last year, NHS North Staffordshire, was awarded the dubious honour for this baffling response to a bid to open a new pharmacy at Madeley Surgery.

It wrote: 'There was not currently a gap on the spectrum of adequacy sufficient to conclude that the provision of pharmaceutical services is not currently secured to the standard of adequacy,' the committee explained as it rejected the application.

NHS Tayside also won an award after it reported that it planned to adopt a 'dashboard approach to performance reporting and assurance'.

Mitt Romney, the defeated Republican Presidential candidate, was named as the winner of the 'Foot in Mouth' award for spoken gibberish after regularly tying himself in knots during the US election campaign.

In one particularly confusing episode, he told voters: 'I believe in an America where millions of Americans believe in an America that's the America millions of Americans believe in. That's the America I love.'

Previous winners have included Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who called for London to become 'a cyclised city'.

In 2010, Former Liverpool and England player Redknapp won the Foot in Mouth Award for his incorrect use of the word 'literally' and other gaffes.

Examples included: 'These balls now - they literally explode off your feet.'

And: 'Steven Gerrard makes runs into the box better than anyone. So does Frank Lampard.'
