A one-year-old boy has learned to propel himself in a wheelchair.

Wyatt Banks landed in a wheelchair after recently being diagnosed with an auto-immune disease that damages the spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed below the chest.

An inspiring video shows the determined toddler refusing to give in to the disease, moving himself forward on a specially designed wheelchair.

Strapped in around his chest, the boy is shown using the wheels to move forward exactly as adults do. 

Once a toy is shown to young Wyatt, he moves more quickly and reaches out to grab it.

Doctors at the Maryland hospital he is currently being treated in say Wyatt is the youngest person they have ever seen use a wheelchair on their own, his mother Abby  Banks told Fox Carolina.

The young boy’s diagnosis has not been made public, it is not known if he will ever walk again.

His fight against the debilitating disease is chronicled on his Facebook page.
