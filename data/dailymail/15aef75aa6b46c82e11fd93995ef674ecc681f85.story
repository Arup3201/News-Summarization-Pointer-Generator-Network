Heartbroken: Karissa Gates, 16, died five months after being diagnosed with cancer

A mother grappling with the death of her 16-year-old daughter from cancer has now had to deal with a mysterious fundraising page from a girl that she has never met.

Karissa Gates died on December 4 following a five-month battle with cancer, and now her family has discovered a Facebook page claiming to be collecting funds for her funeral but they had never been contacted with the page's creator.

The girl who made the memorial page that solicited donations has not been named publicly, but she claims that she is a friend of a friend of Karissa's.

The girl denied any wrong doing, but since she was contacted by both Karissa's godfather and a local news station, she has changed her story multiple times.

Originally, the Facebook page said that it would collect money- cash or checks- that would either be donated to Radys Children's Hospital in San Diego where Karissa was treated or they would go to the funeral home though it did not specify the name of the home.

'I don't know the that family very well but I knew Karissa thatâ€™s why I decided to do this on my own as a fundraier... it the family wants to make a fundraiser that is up to them,' read a typo-riddled message posted by the creator on the page.

'It was more of a friend to friend thing trying to raise money and awareness, thats why all the money will go twds [sic] her funeral as well as childrens hospital so I don't want it written out to the family just so I know exactly where the money goes.'

Confused: Karissa's mother Tima Gates said that she does not know the person who made a memorial Facebook page for her daughter and is concerned that she is soliciting money using her daughter's name

Karissa's godfather, Frances Gebo, told 10News that he contacted the page's creator by phone and was not happy with the insufficient answers he was given.

'I said "who are you going to make the payment to?" She said the funeral home and I said "Well, which funeral home?" And she said "well, well" and didn't have an answer and I said "You know what? This doesn't seem right,"' Mr Gebo said.

The station then contacted the girl herself and she maintained that her intentions were heart-felt.

'I'm not just gonna hand the money over to her mother. I don't know how her family is or what they will use it for! Ok!' the girl wrote in Facebook messages with the 10News reporter.

'This is really hurtful and degrading to be put down as if I'm doing something bad. All the money will be donated in memory of Karissa to Children's Hospital.'

Unanswered questions: The girl who created the Facebook page, who has not been publicly named, claims that she was friends with Karissa and is now holding a toy drive in her honor

Suspicious: Karissa's godfather Frances Gebo called the girl behind the Facebook post and said she had no explanation for where the money would go and did not know the name of the funeral home

The girl has since changed the venue again, collecting toys and cash at a local hair salon allegedly in Karissa's honor.

Karissa's mother remains sketeptical, saying that it appears odd that the girl would have felt to motivated to start her own fundraiser but then not even try contacting the relatives to give condolences.

'If you are going to go to that extent, then you would go to that extent to contact the family,' Tima Gates told 10News.

Now the Gates family has started their own fundraising effort- having not had any further contact with the girl or seen any of the money that she was trying to raise- in order to have enough money to give the teenager a proper burial.
