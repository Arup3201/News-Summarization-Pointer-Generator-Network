A Taylor Swift fan has skillfully recreated every Polaroid picture in the 1989 album booklet, featuring herself in the photos in lieu of the singer.

Nadia Afkhami, a student at the University of Central Florida, posed for the Taylor-inspired pictures while procrastinating during finals week and shared the collage on Tumblr. 

And her efforts have won her the ultimate accolade – a note of praise from Taylor herself.

The singer loved the concept so much that she reposted Nadia's pictures on her own page, writing: 'Nadia this is so cool!'

Fan favorite: A 'very impressed' Taylor reposted Nadia's photos on her Tumblr page and wrote her a note of praise

Amazing feat: The pop star said fan's Polaroids were 'so cool'

Copycat: 'I love your confidence in those photos,' Taylor wrote to Nadia. 'Don't ever doubt or fear that part of you. You are beautiful and you did much more than try'

'It must have taken so much work to recreate all of these. Very impressed. I love your confidence in those photos.

'Don't ever doubt or fear that part of you. You are beautiful and you did much more than try. You set out to do something, then nailed it... in your own way, with your own flare.'

The 25-year-old pop star added: 'I hope finals went well and that you keep doing creative projects! Will be excited to see what you come up with next.'  

Impressive work: 'You set out to do something, then nailed it... in your own way, with your own flare,' the 25-year-old pop star wrote to her fan 

Star pupil: The Blank Space singer noted that she hoped Nadia did well on her finals and encouraged her to keep doing creative projects

Don't stop: Taylor ended her note to Nadia by saying she is excited to see what the student comes up with next

Shake it off: Taylor's words of encouragement helped Nadia laugh off the negative online comments she had received

Ultimate fan: It is not the first time that Taylor has reached out to her fans. Earlier this year, she sent a selection of carefully-chosen gifts to some of her most dedicated supporters after finding their fansites online

Taylor's words of encouragement were exactly what Nadia needed to shake off the online bullies who wrote mean comments about the college student's pictures being 'the fat Taylor version'.

'When I read [the negative comments], I sort of laughed,' Nadia told Buzzfeed News. 

'Some said "I hate when people are trying to be just like their idols, be yourself!" Well, I'm not trying to be anyone but myself. I didn't put on a blonde wig and go out and buy her exact outfit.

'I made it work with what I had. And what I had was just me. And that's something to be proud of. I'm not a size double zero. I'm a size 8. And that's OK with me.'

She added: 'Because I think what people need to understand is that the size of clothing I am, doesn't have anything to do with the size of my heart and all the compassion in it.'

Haters gonna hate: One online bully wrote that the Nadia's snapshots were 'the fat Taylor version'

Individual style: 'I'm not trying to be anyone but myself," Nadia said of her photos. 'I didn't put on a blonde wig and go out and buy her exact outfit' 

Pretty and proud: 'I'm not a size double zero. I'm a size 8,' Taylor's fan noted. 'And that's OK with me'

State of mind: Nadia added: 'I think what people need to understand is that the size of clothing I am, doesn't have anything to do with the size of my heart and all the compassion in it'

Generous donation: Earlier this week, Taylor reached out to another fan in order to thank her for her long-time support; along with a box of gifts and cards, the popstar also included a check for $1,989 in order to help her pay off her student debt

Push my buttons: The star captioned each image with a handwritten lyric from her songs, which Nadia also included in her own replicas

Vintage: Much like the inspiration for her album 1989, each of Taylor's Polaroid pictures has a retro influence

Fashion star: Nadia used items from her own wardrobe in order to replicate Taylor's high fashion ensembles

Tribute: Nadia insists that the images are more about embracing her own take on Taylor's sense of style, rather than her trying to completely copy her idol

Laid back: Many of the images feature Taylor - and Nadia - relaxing in their own homes

 

Accidental art: Taylor has previously said that the original cover Polaroid was taken in the moment and was never intended to be used on the front of her album

Natural state: None of the Polaroids are posed, but were taken while Taylor was going about her day, which is why she appears so relaxed
