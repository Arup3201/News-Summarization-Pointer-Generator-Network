Burger King has agreed to buy Canadian coffee-and-doughnut chain Tim Hortons to create the world's third-largest quick service restaurant group, with sales of about $23billion.

The corporate headquarters of the new company will be in Canada, which may also help Burger King lower its taxes. 

Such tax inversions have been criticized by President Barack Obama and Congress because they mean a loss of tax revenue for the U.S. government.

Unfair? Some Burger King customers are finding it hard to swallow that the home of the Whopper will move to Canada, where they would see their taxes lowered

Burger King and Tim Hortons said the chains will continue to be run independently and that Burger King will still operate out of Miami. 

Investors seemed to welcome the announcement by Burger King late Sunday that it was in talks to buy Tim Hortons. The news pushed shares of both companies up more than 20 percent. 

However, some Burger King customers are finding it hard to swallow that the home of the Whopper will move. 

Customers have been voicing their discontent with the 60-year-old hamburger chain because of the implications for its tax bill. By Monday afternoon, Burger King's Facebook page had more than 1,000 mostly negative comments about the deal.

Shawn Simpson, who hadn't heard of the talks until approached by a reporter while he was at a Burger King in New York City on Monday afternoon, said he didn't like the idea of the company paying its taxes to another country.

'For them to take their headquarters and move it across the border is a negative for me,' said Simpson, 44, who was ordering a Double Whopper and onion rings. 'It's an American brand.'

Customer Gabe Givens wrote on Burger King's Facebook page: 'If you attempt to buy Tim Hortons for the purposes of evading US taxes, I will NEVER step foot in another Burger King again. Don't do it.'

A message from Mike Gee carried a similar sentiment. He said: 'Move to Canada to avoid paying taxes and I will never darken the door of a Burger King again. Does corporate greed in this country ever end? Shame!' 

Zach Bernstein added his disapproving voice to the debate. He wrote: 'I don't patronize corporations that engage in tax inversions, so if you do take that route, count me among the many Americans who will never enter one of your stores again.'

A representative for Burger King, Miguel Piedra, said while the headquarters of the new company would be in Canada, Burger King would still continue to be run out of Miami. Piedra also said the comments on Burger King's Facebook page represent a small fraction of the company's more than 7 million followers on the social media site.

Big U.S. companies, including pharmaceutical AbbiVie and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, recently have pursued tax inversions to cut their costs. Earlier this month, Walgreen abandoned plans to pursue a tax inversion after negative publicity about the planned move.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest wouldn't comment on Burger King's announcement on Monday, but said the president generally believes it's unfair for companies to pursue a tax inversion merely to pay less in taxes. The Obama administration is considering executive steps it could take to de-incentivize inversions.

Tax purposes: The move will be a tax inversion, where one company buys another based in another country in order to lower its taxes

Unlike many other companies, Burger King's move has the potential to turn off customers since it's a brand people are so familiar with. It's difficult to gauge whether such fallout would hurt the fast-food chain's business in the U.S.

Some analysts say even if some Burger King customers are initially angered by the move, the feelings could quickly fade since there wouldn't be any significant changes in restaurants as a result of the deal. Besides, many Burger King customers who go to the chain for convenience may not care enough about the move to change their eating habits, said Jonathan Maze, editor of Restaurant Finance Monitor, which tracks the industry.

'It's going to irritate people, but basically it's a paper move,' he said.

It's not clear exactly how much a combination with Tim Hortons would reduce Burger King's tax costs. A recent report by KPMG found that total tax costs in Canada are 46.4 percent lower than in the United States.

The deal will create a new holding company with 18,000 restaurants in 100 countries and about $22 billion in sales.

The tie-up could help each Burger King and Tim Hortons chains pose a greater challenge to market leaders such as McDonald's and Starbucks.

 It also reflects a desire by both companies to expand internationally. Burger King, which has about 14,000 locations, has been striking deals to open more locations in developing markets.

The company sees plenty of room for growth internationally, given the more than 35,000 locations McDonald's has around the world. Tim Hortons has more than 4,500 locations, mostly in Canada.

Back in the U.S., breakfast and coffee have been hot growth areas in the fast-food industry. Between 2007 and 2012, breakfast grew faster than other segments in the restaurant industry at about 5 per cent a year, according to market researcher Technomic. But it has long remained a weak spot for Burger King.

McDonald's led the category with 31 per cent of the market in 2012, while Burger King had just 3 percent to 4 percent, according to Technomic.

 Burger King's stock surged $5.78, or 21 percent, to $32.89 on Monday, while Tim Hortons' stock also rose 21 percent to $76. 33. 

It wouldn't be the first time Tim Horton has paired with a U.S. fast-food chain. Tim Hortons was purchased by Wendy's International Inc. in 1995. In 2006 it completed an initial public offering and was spun off as a separate company.
