A French cyclist has broken the land speed record on a bicycle by attaching a hydrogen-peroxide rocket to the frame.

Francois Gissy from Alsace recorded a top speed of 163mph (263kph) on his self-built vehicle on an old runway in Munchhouse in North Eastern France.

This record beat his previous mark of 150 mph (242.6kph), set in 2002, and just missed out on the powered bike speed record set in 1995 by the Slipstream bike by 3mph (5kph).

Concentrated liquid hydrogen peroxide flows into a storage tank that contains a catalyst.

This catalyst is usually a material such as silver.

The decomposition catalyst causes the hydrogen peroxide to decompose into water steam and oxygen.

This reaction heats the gas mixture to around 650 degrees.

The hot steam is then pushed through a nozzle attached to the end of 
the rock and this provides the thrust need to push the bicycle forward.

The velocity of the gas flow after the nozzle becomes well over 1000 m/s and gives the rocket a considerable reaction force thrust. The gas mixture after the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide contains oxygen.

The thrust force is increased if this oxygen is used to burn an organic fuel, before it is released through the nozzle.The
 fuel can be a liquid, such as pure alcohol called ethanol that is sprayed in after the 
catalyst chamber.

Or it can be a solid, such as a rod of polyethylene placed after the catalyst chamber.

Gissy designed the bike himself while Swiss company Exotic Thermo Engineering (ETE) and engineer Arnold Neracher designed the rocket that propelled it

ETE's rocket used hydrogen peroxide and is called an 'ecological monopropellant motor.'

The rocket works by putting concentrated liquid hydrogen peroxide into a storage tank that contains a catalyst.

The
 fuel can be a liquid, such as pure alcohol called ethanol that is sprayed in after the 
catalyst chamber.

These kind of rockets are called bipropellant liquid fuel 
rockets.

Or the fuel can be solid, such as a rod of polyethylene 
placed after the catalyst chamber.

Such a rocket is called a hybrid 
rocket. 

The decomposition catalyst causes the hydrogen peroxide to decompose into water steam and oxygen.

This reaction heats the gas mixture to around 650 degrees.

The hot steam is then pushed through a nozzle attached to the end of the rock and this provides the thrust need to push the bicycle forward.

The velocity of the gas flow after 
the nozzle becomes well over 1000 m/s and gives the rocket a 
considerable reaction force thrust.

The gas mixture after the decomposition of the hydrogen peroxide contains oxygen.

The thrust force is increased if this oxygen is used to burn an organic fuel, before it is released through the nozzle.

The record was set at the Munchhouse aerodrome in Haut-Rhin in the Alsace region of France.

The speed was officially recorded using a GPS tracker fitted to the bike's handlebars. 

In the video posted on LiveLeak, Gissy is shown zooming passed a speeding car during his record-breaking ride.
