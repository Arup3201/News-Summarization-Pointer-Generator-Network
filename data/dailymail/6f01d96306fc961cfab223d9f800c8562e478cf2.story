A routine child welfare investigation led to the discovery of a toddler's corpse buried in a grave in the backyard of a Long Island home on Saturday.

State police unearthed the remains outside a tidy house in Farmingdale after Officials with Suffolk County's Child Protective Services visited the family and realizing one of the couple’s three boys was missing.

They grew concerned when the family couldn't account for the whereabouts of a child born in 2009.

Secret burial: The body of a 17-month-old boy was found buried in this 3-foot-deep grave in a Long Island home's backyard on Saturday

Shocking find: The boy was discovered in the backyard of this home after child protective services visited the family and inquired where their youngest born in 2009 was

Investigation's end: After obtaining a search warrant for the home following an interview with the residents, officers found the boy's body resting along this fence line

Police say the boy’s mother Heather Kowalczik admitted her son, Justin Kowalczik, who was about 17-months old, died two years ago after the family moved to Farmingdale from Orange County. After further probing she revealed a possible location for his body.

'It is absolutely a suspicious death and it is being investigated as such,' said State Police Major Patrick Regan. 'We don't have a cause of death, and to our knowledge, there was never a report made of the child being missing.'

Obtaining a search warrant and investigating the property’s backyard, it was there on the fence line they found the boy in a 3-foot grave resting near a soccer goal and children's toys.

The circumstances of his death remained unclear Saturday while foul play is not immediately suspected.

Justin, the youngest half-brother of two older boys – Robert, 9, and Alex, 6 – died in the summer of 2010, according to police.  Authorities said it’s still unclear why the family kept it a secret.

Questioned: The boy's mother Heather Kowalczik, left, is seen along with her boyfriend and the father of two of her oldest boys, Robert Rodriguez, who is a person of interest

Backyard party: Neighbours were shocked by the news saying they had celebrated one of the home's two surviving boy's birthday in the backyard in August

Chasing leads: State Police officers arrived in the dead of night to dig in the backyard after interviewing the boy's mother

Police have listed Kowalczik’s boyfriend, Robert Rodriguez who is the father of her two older boys, as a person of interest.

On Friday, police released an Amber Alert for the oldest boy, Robert, after he failed to show up for school and Rodriguez was also found missing. He was later recovered safely

As of Saturday afternoon, Rodriguez has refused to answer questions, Regan said.

'He did not come in willingly. He is not cooperating,' Regan said.

Neither Rodriguez nor Kowalczik had been charged with any crimes.

Root of the crime: Officers have made no arrests at this time though the boyfriend of the 17-month-old's mother is considered a person of interest while not cooperating with authorities

Other brothers: Officers said that the 17-month-old's surviving half-siblings, two boys, are currently in custody of county child welfare agents

Kowalczik's two surviving children were in the custody of county child welfare agents, police said.

Neighbour Tekiera McCormack told Newsday that she was stunned.

'I can't see this,' she told the newspaper. 'This is crazy. She was a good mother. Those kids loved her.'

Like Ms McCormack, Michelle Peavey said she's especially mortified by the news as the family held a birthday party for one of the boys in the backyard in August.

'You mean we were back there with a body? Oh my god,' Mrs Peavey told MyFoxNY. She said her own boys played in the backyard and attended that same birthday party.

'I just want to sell the house. I don't even want to come back here,' the property's landlord Louis Lancia told Fox.
