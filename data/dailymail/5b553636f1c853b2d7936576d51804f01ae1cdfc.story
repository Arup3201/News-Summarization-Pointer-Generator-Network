Nature walkers are being warned to beware of 'aggressive foreign cows', following attacks on ramblers by imported cattle.

Cows brought to Britain from the continent are posing a danger to ramblers who enter their fields, walkers associations warn today

They are now urging fellow walkers to take care after a number of incidents over recent months, including a fatal attack in Wiltshire where a 66-year-old man was trampled to death.

Clive Grumett, chairman of the Sussex Area Ramblers, said the introduction of more aggressive breeds from Europe had led to the rise in attacks.

He said: ‘Farmers introduced them because they wanted to improve their stock. However, they discovered these breeds were more aggressive after a number of cattle herders were attacked.

‘Dairy cows are used to human interaction because they have to be milked. However, beef cattle are not, so they can be more aggressive.’

The warning comes just weeks after a 66-year-old man was trampled to death by a herd in Wiltshire.

The walker had been with a friend when the cattle charged at the pair, leaving him dead and the other with serious injuries.

Carl Maynard of East Sussex Council said: ‘Thankfully serious incidents involving walkers and cattle are very rare.

'However, we would always recommend walkers take steps to keep themselves as safe as possible.'

Among the advice given is to move as ‘quickly and quietly as possible’, avoid getting between cows and their calves and ‘not panic or run’ as most cows will stop before reaching a human.

John Archer, from the National Farmers' Union, reminded walkers that the countryside remains a working environment.

He added: ‘Walkers should be mindful of their surroundings and especially vigilant on entering a field where the whole field cannot be seen.

‘Follow the advice above and be sympathetic to animals that are rearing their young - please give them space.’
