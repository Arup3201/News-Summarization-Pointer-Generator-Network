Researchers say that recently unearthed photos of the remote Pacific island near the site of a reef where they believe Amelia Earhart's plane may have landed during her doomed 1937 flight around the world could prove that the aviator and her navigator lived for a time as castaways, and didn't die in a supposed crash as previously thought.

Last month, researchers contracted by The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR) found what they say are sonar images of Earhart's plane just off the coast of what is now Nikumaroro Island, which is part of the Phoenix Islands roughly 3,000 miles northeast of Australia in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

Proof? Researchers say these photos of Gardner Island could prove whether Amelia Earhart ended up a castaway after landing her plane in the Pacific Ocean in 1937

At the time of Earhart's flight, the island was known as Gardner Island, a then-uninhabited, seven-mile stretch of sand, shrubs and trees with a large lagoon at its center.

TIGHAR believes Earhart's plane went off course while en-route to Howland Island, roughly 800 miles north of Gardner Island. The group believes the plane made a safe landing on a long, smooth reef just off the coast of Gardner Island and then made it safely to shore, where Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan lived until their demise.

The new photos, discovered by Matthew O'Sullivan, keeper of photographs at the New Zealand Air Force Museum in Christchurch, are aerial photos of the island taken in December of 1938, more than a year after Earhart's plane supposedly landed there.

The 45 photos - found in an unlabeled box containing a sheet of paper saying 'Gardner Island' - are part of a set of aerial obliques taken by a Supermarine Walrus launched 
from HMS Leander in support of the New Zealand Pacific Aviation Survey conducted as the British Navy was looking for possible Pacific landing strips for seaplanes, or even an airfield.

Aim: The purpose of the expedition was to test the hypothesis that the Earhart aircraft, after landing on the reef at Gardner Island (now Nikumaroro), was subsequently washed over the reef edge, broke up in the surf, and sank

As Discovery News points out, the photos were taken about a month before the island's first 'official' habitation, which suggest that any artifacts found on the island would have had to come from Earhart, or been washed ashore.

'For 25 years we have struggled to tease details from a handful of 
printed photos. Now we have an amazing array of detailed aerial images 
of every part of the atoll taken before the first colonists, or even the
New Zealand Survey party, set foot on the island,' Ric Gillespie, 
executive director of TIGHAR, told the publication.

What Gillespie and Discovery News fail to mention, however, is the fact that the island had residents long before the British Navy's 1938 attempt to colonize the island - although they weren't 'official' inhabitants. In fact, people had been living on the island as far back as 1915, when British entrepreneur John Arundel acquired a license to use the island to plant coconut trees.

As part of Arundel's project, 20 workers were brought to Gardner Island to run his coconut operation. They even built iron-roofed structures, which remained on the island even after a severe drought put an end to the project and the islanders were forced off.

Gardner Island had additional human contact prior to Earhart's flight when, in 1929, the SS Norwich City crashed into a reef off the island's northwest corner - likely the same reef where TIGHAR claims Earhart landed her plane.

Eleven of the ship's 35 crew members died in the wreck and the fire that engulfed the ship after it ran aground. The remainder of the crew lived on the island - in collapsed structures from the failed Arundale project - for several days until they were rescued.

In the past, however, TIGHAR, which has made more than 10 trips to the island in search of evidence to support its theories about Earhart, claims to have found several items on the island that suggest the aviator - or at the very least, a female who lived in the 1930s - spent some time on the island, including American beauty and skin care products that may have dated to the 1930s, and a shattered mirror from a woman's cosmetic 
compact. 

TIGHAR has many critics, though, none of whom buy the group's theories of Earhart's final days.

'Not to impugn [the head of TIGHAR], but I don’t think [the group] found anything on any expedition,' a curator at the Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum said during a 2012 interview with the New Republic.
