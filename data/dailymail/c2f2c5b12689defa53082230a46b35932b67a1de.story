A gang made £1 and £2 coins from lead and sprayed them with silver and gold paint, a court heard.

Mark French, 47, Tony Rees, 50, and Anthony Dunn, 53, bought ingots of metal to put through their own press in an east London factory.

Coins worth £10,355 were recovered and the gang processed enough metal to make £16,000 worth of counterfeit currency in a month.

Mark French, 47, Tony Rees, 50, and Anthony Dunn, 53, made these fake coins out of lead with their own press at an east London factory

The men sprayed the fakes with gold and silver paint to make them look like pound or £2 coins. They disguised their factory as a garage

Tony Rees, of Upminster, was jailed for a year for his part in the coin fraud

Police had been keeping the men under observation and raided two premises - a rented business unit in Tarling Road, Canning Town, and a house in nearby Hoy Street.

The business unit was disguised as a vehicle recovery garage as the men worked inside making thousands of coins, the Old Bailey heard.

Royal Mint experts examined the buckets of coins and found they were crude copies.

The coins would not have been accepted in a vending machine because they were magnetic and the wrong size.

Father of-five Dunn rented the premises sprayed the coins and hired the two others to join the team.

French, who has a previous conviction for fraudulently taking a £30,000 lorry, was also convicted of cultivating 32 cannabis plants, which he claimed was to ease his back pain.

Rees, who claimed he was the operation’s ‘dogsbody’, has a previous conviction for conspiracy to make fake Euro notes.

Judge Richard Hone jailed Dunn for nine months, Rees for a year and gave French a nine-month sentence suspended for two years.

The judge said he took into account the coins were ‘of poor visual quality’ and that the conspiracy ran for just over a month in April of last year.

He told Dunn: 'You were the prime mover in this conspiracy. You paid the rent in cash, and you engaged the assistance of your two co-defendants.'

The judge told French that he took into account a recent job offer when deciding on the suspended jail term.

‘You have been friends with Tony Dunn for many years and you were drawn into this conspiracy with him,' he said.

Judge Hone said Rees’s previous convictions were a serious aggravating feature.

‘But it seems to me you also were involved for only a few weeks and had the shortest role of the three defendant,’ he added.

French, of Canning Town, Rees, of Upminster, and Dunn, of Stepney, all east London, admitted conspiracy to make counterfeit coins.

The three men hugged each other in the dock before two of them were led away.

DI Doug Blackwood, from the City of London Police, said: ‘Dunn, Rees and French had their criminal counterfeiting conspiracy all set up and were fast on their way to establishing small-scale commercial fake coin production.

‘But they were rather surprised when police officers found all three of them together in the derelict warehouse where the spray painting took place.’

He added: ‘There is no doubt that they could have set up a steady production of fake coins had they not been caught.

'There were around five to eight thousand in various stages of production when officers executed a warrant at the premises.

‘It was quite a labour intensive process. Each moulded coin had to have a penny placed in the centre before it was sprayed gold and then each was finished by hand to make them appear more genuine.’
