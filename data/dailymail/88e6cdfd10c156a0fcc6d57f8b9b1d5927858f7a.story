BNP leader Nick Griffin obviously thinks the way to the British public’s vote is through their stomachs.

The MEP, who was last week declared bankrupt, is trying his hand as a TV chef promising recipes on how to cook ‘traditional British fare’ on his large Aga.

In a bizarre 30-minute video, Mr Griffin swigs beer like Keith Floyd while imparting tips on how to chop an onion and why English food is the best in Europe.

Recipe: BNP leader Nick Griffin has posted his cookery tips online for workers and their wives who do not know how to make cheap meals

Cooking a British stew certainly seemed to be thirsty work, with Mr Griffin taking swings from a pint glass and a bottle as he rattled the pots and pans

Mr Griffin claims he was given culinary inspiration after speaking at a public meeting where people warned of the impact of ‘poverty’ on their workmates.

He warns that many people – more specifically ‘their wives’ - do not know how to cook cheap food so he offers a ‘recipe for beating the Tory blues’.

But during the lengthy BNP video posted on YouTube, which includes a description of different sized potatoes and the merits of swede, he manages to make several political points about why all things English are best.

Addressing the camera in what appears to be his own kitchen, he tells viewers: ‘One of our chaps in Birmingham was saying that people he works with were saying they simply cannot afford, their wives cannot afford to put enough decent food on the table.

‘He said part of the trouble of course is a lot of these people cannot cook.

‘So you can talk about producing cheap food and cooking for yourselves but really all they know is cheap packet food.

‘In those circumstances you simply cannot do cheap meals. You have to pay the top supermarket prices.'

Tip: Among the many pieces of advice given by the BNP leader is the need to remove the skin from an onion before chopping

Patriotic: Mr Griffin chose British beef, but not the best cut and found two packets which were reduced in the supermarket

New career? Mr Griffin suggests his exhaustive cookery advice could become a regular feature

So he sets about producing British stew, using reduced beef, onions, carrots, beer, tobasco and swede: ‘You can have too much swede… unless you are a goat.’

His tips include not eating the outside of an onion, how cheese can be used on a jacket potato and remembering to remove the foil from stock cubes.

Getting political in the kitchen, Mr Griffin goes on: ‘English cookery for centuries was the best in Europe… very advanced, lots of spices.

‘It became very simple after the Hanoverians came over from northern Germany. As you know I spend a lot of time on the continent.

‘I reckon you can go to fancy French restaurants, or fancy restaurants anywhere you like…

‘You can go to all those fancy restaurants and you won’t get anything in fact certainly no better if as good as you get from decent cooking in a decent English pub these days.’

Cheers: Mr Griffin said the fact he had drunk some of the beer would not harm the recipe

Taste test: BNP members Tony and Chris declared the food was 'very tasty' but the unnamed surly teenager at the table was not asked for her opinion

He later dismisses the idea that the popularity of curry in Britain requires top chefs from Asia.

Insisting the word ‘curry’ comes from a 13th century cook book, Mr Griffin declares: ‘Don’t let people tell you that you have to have huge numbers of immigrants to have good cooking.’

He also reveals there is a Mexican restaurant ‘in a town not far from here’.

‘The place isn’t swamped with Mexicans. You take the recipe – that’s really all you need,’ he adds.

After half an hour of chopping, stirring and slurping he announces Blue Peter-like: ‘Here’s one I made earlier’.

BNP members Tony and Chris are asked to taste the carb-heavy meal before declaring – not too enthusiastically – that it is ‘very nice’.

An unnamed, somewhat surly-looking, teenager sitting at the table is not asked for her opinion.

Mr Griffin signs off: ‘Give it a go. If you haven’t cooked before, surprise yourself.’
