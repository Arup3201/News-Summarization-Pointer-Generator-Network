The mother condemned to death in Sudan for marrying a Christian is being prevented from fleeing the country by her callous brother - and could face an entirely new trial.

Meriam Ibrahim has been hit with a new petition by Al Samani Al Hadi who has publicly vowed to execute her if he gets the chance.

But lawyers for Meriam, a 27-year-old doctor, say that he is just acting out of spite and that he does not have any authority over her.

MailOnline can also reveal that Meriam could face an entirely new hearing that could delay her departure by weeks or months.

Free: Meriam poses hours after her release on Monday with her husband, Daniel (left) and her children, Martin (on Daniel's knee) and baby Maya. She is now facing a possible new hurdle to her freedom

She faces forgery charges that relate to the documents she used to try and flee Sudan  - and could be hauled before a judge again.

The twist represents the latest setback for Meriam in her attempt to leave Sudan and fly to the US.

She was freed on June 30 after spending eight months behind bars in a horrific women's prison in the Sudanese capital Khartoum.

During her time in the facility she gave birth to daughter Maya, one month, in shackles whilst her son Martin, 21 months, was by her side during the entire ordeal.

The day after the sentence was overturned Meriam and her family tried to fly to South Sudan en route to the US but she was detained and accused of using false papers in a naked attempt to thrawt her by the Sudanese government.

Now adding to her woes is her half brother Al Hadi, a strict Muslim who was supposedly furious when he learned she had been let out of jail and vowed vengeance to restore Muslim honour.

Meriam's lawyer Shareif Ali Shareif told MailOnline: ‘Her brother [Al Samani Al Hadi] has launched a new petition to the family court to prove that Meriam is his sister.

‘He does not want Meriam to travel to Sudan.

'Barbaric': As well as the death sentence for apostasy (the crime of abandoning your religion) Ibrahim was also sentenced to 100 lashes for what the court deemed her adultery for marrying a Christian

‘He asked the court to rule that Meriam is his sister. This would give him a legal right over her.

‘But he does not have the authority to demand this right – it is only a father or a mother that can demand this legal status.

'He is doing this to prevent Meriam from travelling outside of Sudan.

‘Meriam has not been officially informed of this latest move. She has not been interviewed and has not appeared in court.

‘We [Meriam’s legal team] are aware of the new legal process but we have not received any documents as yet.'

Meriam is married to Daniel Wani, a naturalized US citizen, and was sentenced to death and 100 lashes for apostasy and adultery when she married him because the court did not recognize the wedding.

A judge ruled that because she was born a Muslim - her father left home when she was six - it did not matter that she was raised a Christian and said that she had the renounce her faith or die.

Meriam's family history is complicated and it appears Al Hadi was part of the second family that her father started after he left her mother.

She claims never to have met him in her life and his motives for interfering in her life seem somewhat murky.

Shareif told MailOnline that Meriam still has to deal with the forgery allegations before she is free to leave Sudan and move in with Daniel, a biochemist who lives in Manchester, New Hampshire.

A hearing is set for Thursdsay but what happens after that is unclear.

He said: ‘Meriam wants to leave Sudan as soon as possible.

‘But she is still being investigated by the National Intelligence and Security Service with relation to the allegation that she had obtained a false travel document. This is still on-going.

‘Meriam has not been given an American passport.'

Tina Ramirez, of religious campaign group Hardwired, said that she did not know what the court would do about the forgery allegations.

She said that it was possible Meriam could have to go through a new trial, but negotiations are said to be ongoing between the Sudanese government and the US embassy in Khartoum over her release.

Meriam's case attracted international attention and the governments of the UK, the US and the United Nations all called for her to be freed.

Bill and Hillary Clinton were also among those demanding she be released, as was human rights campaigner Mia Farrow.

MailOnline has repeatedly highlighted Meriam's case and has spoken to numerous Senators who are behind attempts to get her to America.

Shareif told MailOnline that despite all the strain Meriam and her family are under they are 'all fine'.

He said: 'Meriam, Daniel and the children are in good health.’
