A year after letting top wide receiver DeSean Jackson go, Chip Kelly has again put his stamp on the Philadelphia Eagles with a jaw-dropping piece of business.

Two-time All-Pro running back LeSean McCoy will be traded to the Buffalo Bills in exchange for third-year linebacker Kiko Alonso.

The stunning trade will reunite Eagles head coach Kelly with former Oregon star Alonso, who is coming off ACL surgery after a dominant rookie year in 2013.

McCoy was regularly sidelined in favour of Chris Polk during the Eagles' disastrous stretch, which saw the Dallas Cowboys claim the NFC East title.

The move should end CJ Spiller's time in Buffalo and further confirms the devaluation of the running back position.

Freeing up $11.95million in cap space, the move adds fuel to the fire that the Eagles will move up for former Ducks quarterback - and Kelly protege - Marcus Mariota in April's draft. 

ESPN's Adam Schefter first reported the trade, with NFL.com's Michael Silver confirming the move.
