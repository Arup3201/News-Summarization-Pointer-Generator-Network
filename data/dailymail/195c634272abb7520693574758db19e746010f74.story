Former Tottenham and Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas has ruled out the possibility of replacing Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool.

The Zenit St Petersburg manager has been linked with the Anfield hot-seat in some quarters but he insists that he has no intention of returning to the Premier League after two shorts spells in London.

Rodgers is under pressure with the Reds sitting 11th in the table, having been eliminated from the Champions League at the group stage.

But Villas-Boas is enjoying his role in Russia and has no plans to return to England anytime soon.

In an interview with Portuguese TV channel TVI on Tuesday, the 37-year-old said: 'I'm not the least interested in this. Returning to England is definitely not in my plans.

'I liked coaching in England, it was a positive experience, but negative things also happened.'

Villas-Boas left Spurs in December 2013 following a 5-0 home defeat by Liverpool but he insists he was not sacked by the north London club.

'Tottenham set a points and victories record in my first season, and missed out on the Champions League by one point and had a great run in the Europa League,' he said.

'In the second season, at the time I left we had more points than in the previous season. I ended up leaving by mutual agreement - it wasn't a sacking - because I gave full support to the football director Franco Baldini who meanwhile had other ambitions, meaning that I ended up with players that did not fit the profile I wanted.

'The chairman proposed a challenge to increase Tottenham's competitive level, but immediately [Luka] Modric left and we didn't get any of the targets I had identified, such as Joao Moutinho, Willian, Oscar or Leandro Damiao. These were promises that were not kept. I had a group of players I had not chosen.'

The ex-Porto boss was given the boot by Chelsea after just seven-and-a-half months but he insists that a legal battle between owner Roman Abramovich and his former business partner Boris Berezovsky had a part to play in his sacking.

Villas-Boas added: 'I arrived at a difficult time in the private life of the chairman, who was rarely present. This clearly had an effect. 

'Then I was surprised and I am still surprised that the chairman's intentions changed. When I went there the idea was to rebuild the team.'
