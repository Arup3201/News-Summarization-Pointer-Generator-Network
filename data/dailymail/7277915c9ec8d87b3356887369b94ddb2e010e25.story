The devastated aunt of the five-year-old boy who who was swept into the sea on the NSW Central Coast on Thursday has revealed the family's heartbreak as he is feared to be drowned.

'Heading to Umina to be with my family... may the lord give us strength today and bring our Little Chayce home to us,' she wrote on Facebook.

Ms Kupu posted photos of Chayce on her page as tributes poured in for the young boy who has been missing since 1.50pm pm on Thursday.

The boy, believed to be from the Central Coast but holidaying at the beachside village with his family, was playing on the shore with his siblings when a large wave swept him into the ocean.

A frantic search failed to find him on Thursday after he vanished.

On Thursday evening Ms Kupe wrote: 'Devastated to loose my little nephew today ... we will find Chayce ... Loving you always Aunty Wella.'

'And that is quite tragic and our hearts and thoughts do go out to the family this morning.'

Det Supt Hutchings said the visibility for divers was quite poor and a large swell along the coast was affecting the current.

The boy's family arrived on the beach are being comforted by police and counsellors.

Locals from the small coastal community say the tragedy is heartbreaking.

'Pearl Beach is a very special place because it's a real community even though there is not a lot of permanent residents here,' general store owner Kevin McCunn said.

'It feels like a tragedy for the community.'

It is understood that most of the family were not confident in the water.

Surf lifesavers told Fairfax Media the boy's family might not have been able to save him.

'They're not sure whether anybody could actually swim,' a spokeswoman for Surf Life Saving NSW said.

Acting Superintendent Paul Nicholls said the young boy, who was staying with extended family in a house opposite the beach, was with a group of family and friends, including children, at the time of the incident.

Acting Superintendent Nicholls said friends and family tried unsuccessfully to grab the boy but were unable to reach him.

A command post had been set up and was manned overnight on Thursday

'We understand that some of the people that he was with have gone into the water to go and assist but they were unable to locate him,' he told the ABC.

Locals have turned up at the beach offering to help the grief-stricken family.

Resident Mandy Harris told AAP the waves were very dangerous when the boy was swept into the ocean.

'They were the biggest I have ever seen and I have lived here for eight years,' she said.

'The trouble is there is a lot of undertows in the ocean.'

Pearl Beach general store owner Kevin McCunn said the suspected drowning is a real tragedy for the tight-knit, beachside community.

Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command and Surf Life Saving Australia all took to the waters

He said the northern end of the beach, where the young boy was playing, was a dangerous spot.

'It's been rough seas the last few days and at the north end of the beach it can be quite dangerous,' he said.

A resident told the Sydney Morning Herald a young boy was the last person to spot the child in the surf.

'The child was only spotted once [in the surf], I believe, and he was actually playing at the north end of the beach and thatâ€™s the rough end,' she said.

The resident, who did not want to be named, also claimed the five-year-old was playing with siblings.

A full scale air and sea search was immediately conducted involving police from Brisbane Water Local Area Command, the Marine Area Command, Surf Life Saving Australia, NSW Ambulance Service and the Westpac Life Saver Helicopter and the sea search continued overnight after the light faded.

A NSW police spokesperson told MailOnline on Friday morning: 'The search has resumed but there is unfortunately nothing new.'

Marine Area Command officers continued the search throughout Thursday night with the assistance of the Police Rescue Squad officers.

'Because of the darkness a lot of the resources can't be used,' a police spokesman said.

Dye had been released into the water during the search in order to determine the direction of the currents.

A nearby restaurant owner said people on the beach were 'totally beside themselves' after hearing the news.

'We all feel sick to our stomach, we are worried about the poor parents,' Melissa, from Pearls on the Beach restaurant told TVNZ. 'It's quite rough out there.'

The picturesque coastal hamlet has been a popular destination with school holidays taking place over the past week.

However the beach is not patrolled.
