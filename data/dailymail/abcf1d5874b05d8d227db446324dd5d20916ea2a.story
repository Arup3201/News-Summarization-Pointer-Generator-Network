Arsenal captain Thomas Vermaelen might be on a holiday from football, but he still found time for a kick-about on the beach in Barbados.

The Belgian centre-back, enjoying a break with his family between the World Cup and the new Premier League season, showed off his skills by the sea.

Head boy: The defender couldn't resist getting a football out on the beach in Barbados

Rumours: Vermaelen was a teammate of van Persie at Arsenal, and could be again at Manchester United

Vermaelen played just 31 minutes of Belgium's campaign in Brazil, after a season on the periphery of the Gunners' first team.

The defender's lack of playing time has seen him linked with Manchester United, and with United striker Robin van Persie in Barbados have done nothing to quieten rumours that the Arsenal skipper may be following his predecessor to old Trafford.

Making a splash: The defender stops the ball from going in the water

Decision time: The Arsenal skipper has been heavily linked with a move away from the Emirates this summer

The Dutch captain spent time with Vermaelen for the second day running on Friday, as his club teammates flew to America on a pre-season tour.
