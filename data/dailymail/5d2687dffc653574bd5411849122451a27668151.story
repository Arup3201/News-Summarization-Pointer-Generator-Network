A Northern California deputy district attorney has been removed from a criminal prosecution after officials say he failed to disclose a romantic relationship with a crime lab technician.

Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Ted Kajani is no longer overseeing the prosecution of brothers David Zimmer and Robert Zimmer for the 1989 strangulation of David Zimmer's estranged wife, Cathy.

Officials say Kajani had put the criminalist Amanda Cardenas with whom he had an affair on the stand to testify about DNA evidence in the case.

The affair began before Cardenas testified in May at a preliminary hearing for the Zimmer brothers, authorities said.

Cardenas also testified before a grand jury that would indict the two on charges that they killed Cathy Zimmer, reported the San Francisco Chornicle.

Mother Cathy Zimmer, 38, was killed in 1989 

There is no evidence that DNA or other evidence was compromised as a result of the affair, said Assistant District Attorney David Angel, head of the conviction integrity unit at the district attorney's office.

'Legally, I don't think it's a conflict of interest or anything like that,' Angel said.

'However, it gives an appearance of impropriety, and it's unprofessional, and when we found out about it, we wanted to disclose it and try to rectify it.' 

The body of Cathy Zimmer, a 38-year-old mother of two  was discovered in the back seat of her Chrysler New Yorker in the short-term parking lot on March 10, 1989 and her body was covered up with a quilt. 

David Zimmer, and his 70-year-old brother, were both arrested earlier this year and charged with first-degree-murder.

Initial evidence pointed to at least Robert Zimmer being involved, his DNA was found on an ‘intimate’ area of the murdered woman’s clothes, investigators said.

The brother-in-law insisted all along he did not have a physical relationship with her, but investigators kept pursuing his guilt.

The couple was in the middle of a divorce and her soon-to-be ex-husband mysteriously cashed two life insurance policies worth $183,000 before selling their home for $225,000 shortly after her death , according to KTVU.

Robert Zimmer’s daughter Paula recalled in 2010 to investigators that his father obsessed over his fingerprints being found in her car as police combed it for evidence in the days after the discovery. 

He insisted he never had any type of personal or sexual relationship with Cindy Zimmer, but could not recall if he was ever alone in a car with her, authorities said.
