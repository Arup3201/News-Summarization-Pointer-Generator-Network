Jeb Bush has given himself a deadline of the end of this year to decide whether or not he will made a bid to follow his father and brother's footsteps by running for president.

The former Florida governor says all the speculation about whether he'll run in 2016 is actually getting him more attention than if he had already entered the race.

Bush has antagonized many Republicans by supporting an immigration overhaul- a topic that he has worked on for years and co-authored a book on immigration reform last year.

Cooling expectations: Former Florida governor Jeb Bush, seen here in January, has said that he is giving himself to the end of the year to decide about whether or not he wants to run for president

On
 immigration, he said that those who come into the country illegally 
generally do so because they had no other means to provide for their 
family, and what they did is 'not a felony'.

'It's an act of love. It's an act of commitment to your family,' Bush said.

'I
 honestly think that that is a different kind of crime. There should be a
 price paid, but it shouldn't rile people up that people are actually 
coming to this country to provide for their families.'

He denied that he's purposefully trying to ramp up the speculation, and expects it will continue until he makes his decision before year's end.

He told Fox News Channel in an interview airing Sunday that the state of politics is 'crazy right now'.

Bush says one factor in his decision will be whether he can deliver an optimistic, hopeful message without getting drawn into a political 'mud fight'.

He says the other main factor in his decision will be whether his family approves of a run.

The interview with Bush occurred at his father's presidential library during the celebration of the 25th anniversary of George. H. W. Bush's presidency.

This is just the latest in a series of non-denial denials that Bush, 61, has issued over the past few months.

In November, he told CNN: 'There's a time to make a decision. You shouldn't make it too early, you shouldn't make it too late. There's a time. There's a window. And this is not the time for me. This is the time to show a little self-restraint.'
