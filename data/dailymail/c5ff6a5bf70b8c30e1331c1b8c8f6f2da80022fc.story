Kidnappers in Nigerian who took an American missionary hostage on Monday morning are demanding a ransom of nearly $300,000, authorities have said.

The Rev. Phyllis Sortor, 70, was abducted while she was at the Hope Academy, where she works as a financial administrator in Emiworo, Kogi State, officials from her Seattle church said on Tuesday.

Friends of Sortor were later contacted by the thugs who are demanding 60 million naira, or nearly $300,000, for her safe return, Kogi Police Commissioner Adeyemi Ogunjemilusi told NBC News.

Kidnappers in Nigerian who took American missionary Rev. Phyllis Sortor on Monday morning are demanding a ransom of nearly $300,000, authorities have revealed

Dramatic: A group of masked gunmen stormed Hope Academy on Monday morning around 10am and fired sporadically to scare off bystanders while they took Sorter into their custody 

He believes the kidnapping is the work of a local criminal gang, rather than terrorist group Boko Haram doesn't usually operate in the area.

'We will do all within the available resources to ensure the safe rescue of the victim,' the commissioner said, noting that officials are combing the forest for her.

State Department officials declined to provide information about the kidnapping, reports .

'The U.S. Embassy has been notified, and the State Department and the FBI are working with local authorities to find and rescue her,' Bishop David Kendall said on the Seattle church's website.

Tensions? Sorter has been working as a missionary in Africa for the past 10 years. Friends and family say she has infuriated local leaders by building Christian schools in the majority-Muslim country 

A group of masked gunmen raided Hope Academy, the school that Sorter and her church built in the village of Emiworo around 10am on Monday morning.

The kidnappers 'came into the school premises shooting sporadically to scare away people before taking (the hostage) away into the bush', a Kogi state police spokesman said.

Sorter has been working as a missionary in Africa for the last decade, and friends say she has faced some resistance from local leaders for building Christian schools in the majority-Muslim northern portion of the country.

'She's had a lot of opposition,' friend Judy O'Brien, who attended Seattle Pacific University with Sorter, told KOMO.

On Monday night, Sorter's friends and family gathered at her church at Seattle Pacific University to pray for her safe return.

Coming together? Friends and family gathered at Sorter's church in Seattle on Monday to pray for her release 

Taken by surprise: Sorter's stepson Richard Sorter attended the prayer service and called the experience of his step-mother's kidnapping as 'surreal' 

Her stepson Richard Sorter was in attendance and has called the whole experience 'surreal'.

'We just want her to be safe and get out,' he said. 'We are just a working-class family, we don't have any money. That's not a huge church, they don't have money.'

Nigeria is one of the world's worst country's for kidnapping, a major criminal enterprise that makes millions of dollars a year.

Criminal gangs have kidnapped scores of expatriates in southern and central Nigeria over the years.

The central Kogi state has also had low level activity by Islamist militants linked to insurgent group Boko Haram, security sources say - though that group operates mainly in northeastern Nigeria.
