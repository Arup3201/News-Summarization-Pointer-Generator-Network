Alec Stewart says he reported to the England and Wales Cricket Board that he had been told Tim Bresnan, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann all had access to a parody Kevin Pietersen Twitter account.

Stewart made the claims on Wednesday night, saying he was told by the account's owner, Richard Bailey, at a Test match in 2012.

The 'KPgenius' account is a prominent topic in Pietersen's autobiography, published this week. Pietersen cites the account as one example of a culture of 'bullying' inside the England dressing room.

Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann are among three ECB players said to have had access to parody account

Kevin Pietersen claims there was a bullying culture inside the England camp

Bailey is a cricket fan and a friend of Broad, but has always maintained he ran the account alone with no input from the dressing room, telling the Guardian on Wednesday: 'They 100 per cent did not tweet from it.'

Swann used his column in Wednesday's edition of The Sun to refute the claims, insisting that while he did follow it, he did not have a hand in running it.

That came after Pietersen's book told a story of Stewart claiming Bailey had confided in him that three members of the England team had access to the account.

Angered that his 'integrity' had been questioned by Bailey's denial, Stewart told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'The reason I am prepared to talk about is that he (Bailey) has said he didn't say anything to me and therefore is doubting my integrity and I won't have that.

Alec Stewart passed on information he received to the ECB

'I aren't here to nail Pietersen, Broad, Swann, Bresnan. I'm an ex-England player and an England fan.

'What happened, back in 2012 at the Oval, at the top tier of the OCS Stand at the Vauxhall End of the ground, this gentleman came up and said to me: 'I understand you follow the KPgenius twitter account'.

'I said 'yes, some of it is funny, some of it is close to the bone'. He then said 'that is me', I said 'very good, well done'. He then came back and said, 'can I keep a secret?', I said 'yes, but it depends what you're going to tell me'.

'He said 'I can't tell you' and then walked away. Thirty seconds later he came back and said 'three players have access to the account, they have the password' and he told me the three names.

Andy Flower (right) was made aware of the information, says Stewart

'The names were Bresnan, Broad and Swann and it didn't sit comfortably with me. Not because I wanted them three players to get fined, but it didn't sit comfortably with me if what he was saying was factually correct.

'I then made Hugh Morris, and Andy Flower at a later date, aware of the conversation, passed on that information and left it at that. If the ECB wanted to investigate or ignore, they could.

'I'm not going to doubt what Pietersen, Broad, Swann, or whoever has said but I will guarantree 100 per cent this lad said that to me.'

There was no comment from the ECB on Stewart's claims on Wednesday night.

Stewart's comments came after Pietersen described the ECB as 'dinosaurs ... shooting themselves in the foot'.

Tim Bresnan is the third England player said to have had access to the parody account

The sacked batsman was referring to the emergence on Tuesday night of a leaked document, which appeared to log the ECB's list of his alleged misdemeanours during last winter's descent to Ashes whitewash in Australia.

A month after his return, Pietersen was told he would not be picked by England again - bringing an apparent end to his record-breaking but controversial career.

As he was promoting his autobiography in a series of interviews, the document - which ECB swiftly made clear was a draft of a private internal email - somehow came into the possession of website Cricinfo.

It is unclear how the document reached the public domain but was, in any case, a turn of events which did not impress Pietersen.

Pietersen has accused the ECB of shooting themselves in the foot over a leaked document

Speaking before an appearance on BT's The Clare Balding Show, to be broadcast on Thursday, he said in quotes carried on www.cricketworld.com: 'I think there are times in your life where you shoot yourselves in the foot, and I don't think the ECB helped themselves last night.

'It's embarrassing what happened last night.

'When you're dealing with dinosaurs that don't understand social media they are going to shoot themselves in the foot - and they've done it.'

Several issues are sure to rear their head again along with plenty of others as Pietersen continues a marathon promotional tour.

But the 34-year-old had braced himself for the experience.

'I said to my wife and 'team' last week, 'this week will be carnage - I'll be in the eye of the storm, and it'll happen and then it'll go.''

Former Australian captain Ricky Ponting has corroborated Pietersen's claim of bullying

Pietersen's recollection of bullying on the field, often directed by bowlers towards fielders who made mistakes, has been corroborated by former Australia captain Ricky Ponting.

He has made it clear in an interview with the Australian press that he too often noticed the intimidating behaviour among his Ashes opponents.

Pietersen said: 'You write books like this when you've got evidence to back it up and you've got people who are prepared to back it up.

'I haven't even spoken to Punter [Ricky Ponting]. When I woke up this morning and I saw this, one of the greatest cricketers to have ever played the game, how do you think he views it when he's in the opposition and he's seeing team-mates abuse each other and bully each other on a cricket field?

'How do you reckon it feels for the individuals that are going through it in the dressing room. I've been speaking to the coach about it for years.'

'Six months' time, you never know, there could be a change at the top, I live in hope. And one day I hope to be able to play Test cricket again. If I got the call now, I'd leave your show!'
