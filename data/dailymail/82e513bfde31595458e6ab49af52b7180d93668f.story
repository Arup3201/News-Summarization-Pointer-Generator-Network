Lord Steel yesterday continued to insist he had heard nothing to suggest Cyril Smith had been involved in any offending while a Liberal MP.

The peer, who led the Liberals between 1976 and 1988, admitted he had been informed in 1979 that Smith had been investigated by police for child abuse when he was a Labour councillor.

However, he maintained that ‘no complaint or even rumour’ reached his office that Smith had been accused of paedophile activities during the 1970s when he was Liberal MP for Rochdale and Steel was his Westminster colleague.

That is despite the fact allegations of Smith’s law breaking were swirling around Parliament well into the 1980s.

Speaking at length for the first time about claims he ignored rumours about the 28-stone monster, Lord Steel said he was happy to be interviewed as part of any police probe into whether there was a cover-up of Smith’s crimes.

He recommended Smith be given a knighthood in 1988 – despite claims that senior figures in both the political and security establishment knew of allegations against him.

Last night Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP whose book revealed the full extent of Smith’s abuse, accused Lord Steel of being disingenuous.

‘Is he really telling the public that no one ever mentioned these allegations to him?’ he asked. ‘We are talking about what was an exceptionally small political party.

‘It seems incredible that Steel hadn’t heard of any of these allegations after 1979.’

On Thursday, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg urged police to investigate whether there had been an establishment cover-up of Smith’s activities. He died in 2010 without facing justice.

In a statement yesterday to the Daily Telegraph, Lord Steel said he would co-operate with any police inquiry. ‘I agree that there should be a fresh inquiry and am happy to be interviewed, having known nothing beyond the 1979 published report of police investigations when Cyril Smith was a Labour councillor in the Sixties,’ he said.

‘No complaint, nor even rumour, of his alleged misbehaviour as an MP ever reached us, and indeed stories only came to light after his death.’

Mr Danczuk said he was disappointed that Lord Steel seemed to be highlighting Smith’s earlier Labour links: ‘Most members of the public, and certainly me, do not care which party Smith belonged to.

‘This is a case of a senior politician using his power to abuse boys, and Steel should be thinking more about the victims and less about party politics.

‘Lord Steel is being disingenuous – muddying the waters rather than clearing them. He now needs to come clean to the public on when he challenged Smith, what he said to him and what Smith said back.

‘We know for a fact that Liberal MPs, Liberal parliamentary candidates and Liberal councillors throughout the decades knew about these allegations.’

Claims about Smith’s paedophilia were printed in the May 1979 issue of the tiny Rochdale Alternative Press, and the report was brought to the attention of Lord Steel.

His spokesman responded at the time: ‘It’s not a very friendly  gesture, publishing that. All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms’.

But it has been claimed that the Liberal leadership was so worried the allegations would gain wider circulation that they called in Harold Wilson’s hugely influential legal fixer, Lord Arnold Goodman, to hush them up.

Dominic Carman said his barrister father George Carman QC, who was then representing former Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe as he prepared to stand trial for conspiracy to murder, feared that reports of Smith’s abuse in national newspapers could have seriously damaged his defence.

He added: ‘My understanding both from the time and afterwards was that Lord Goodman may well have been involved. It appears that he did a very good job of stopping the story from being repeated.’

Despite overwhelming evidence that rumours of Cyril Smith’s appalling behaviour were widely known at Westminster, Lord Steel maintains he knew – or heard – nothing save for the allegations in 1979 that the MP had abused young boys.

As Labour MP Simon Danczuk’s explosive book revealed in the Mail last week, Smith’s serial sexual abuse of vulnerable youngsters was repeatedly covered up by the Establishment.

And in the years following the original allegations, printed in the Rochdale Alternative Press and repeated in the satirical magazine Private Eye, Smith’s sordid activities continued.

Was Lord Steel, who nominated the predatory paedophile for a knighthood in 1988, totally ignorant of rumours of the MP’s depraved conduct? Here the Mail details the incidents he claims he knew nothing about:

In the 1980s Smith’s car was pulled over on the motorway near Northampton and traffic officers discovered child porn in the boot. Local police wanted to press charges but a phone call was made from London and the MP was released without charge.

One young Liberal activist was sexually assaulted in Smith’s office in the House of Commons in the 1980s as other MPs, including Labour leader Michael Foot, walked by.

Smith’s alleged abuse of boys was publicly raised during the 1987 general election by his Labour opponent David Williams. ‘Everyone in Rochdale heard rumours about him, and I believed they should be properly investigated,’ he said. ‘Perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf , But Cyril Smith was a dirty politician, so I decided to do it.’

A former campaigner for the Social Democratic Party, then in an alliance with the Liberal Party, said senior party officials panicked during the 1983 election through fear that Smith would be exposed as a child abuser. Charles Baker, an SDP activist in Hertfordshire, said: ‘There was a kind of an alert, an alarm that one of the other parties had got hold of the fact that Cyril Smith had interfered with boys yet again.’

Smith was a visitor to the notorious Elm Guest house in south-west London, now the focus of a Scotland Yard investigation into an alleged VIP paedophile ring in the 1980s.
