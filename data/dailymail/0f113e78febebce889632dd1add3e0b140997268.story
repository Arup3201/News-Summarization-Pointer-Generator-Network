Prisoners will make sandbags, fence posts and other kit for the Army in a drive to teach them the ‘value of a hard day’s work’, the Government has announced.

The ten-year deal to produce equipment will save the Armed Forces money and give inmates valuable employment skills, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said.

It comes as new reforms to rehabilitate offenders kick in, including support at the prison gate when they finish their sentence.

Mr Grayling said: ‘By providing this new service, prisoners will be giving something back to their country, while learning important new skills and the value of a hard day’s work.’

The agreement builds on a six-month trial that has already reaped savings of nearly £500,000.

It will see a number of products made by inmates, including some previously produced overseas.
