Some of Britain’s leading charities have been accused of handing their chief executives excessive pay rises.

Thirty executives at the country’s 14 leading international development charities now earn more than £100,000, it emerged last night.

The Charity Commission, the sector’s watchdog has accused the of ‘bringing the charitable world into disrepute’.

Conservative MP Priti Patel, pictured, says taxpayers deserve to know how their money is spent. They'll be 'shocked to see so many highly paid executives in charities that are dependent on public funds'

Despite falling donations, 11 bosses at the 14 charities which make up the Disasters Emergency Committee are now paid more than the Prime Minister’s £142,500.

The figures display a marked increase in salaries at the organisations, which employed just 19 people on six-figure salaries in 2010.

The charities employ nearly 200 staff who are paid more than £60,000 - an increase of 16 per cent between 2010 and 2012.

William Shawcross, chairman of the Charity Commission, warned charities to control boardroom pay or risk doing harm to their reputations.

He said: ‘It is not for the Commission to tell charities how much they should pay their executives. That is a matter for their trustees.

‘However in these difficult times, when many charities are experiencing shortfalls, trustees should consider whether very high salaries are really appropriate, and fair to both the donors and the taxpayers who fund charities.

‘Disproportionate salaries risk bringing organisations and the wider charitable world into disrepute.’

The Disasters Emergency Committee was set up 50 years ago to coordinate work at times of tragedy around the world.

The charities involved with DEC include Action Aid, Age International, British Red Cross, CAFOD, Care International, Christian Aid, Concern Worldwide, Islamic Relief, Merlin, Oxfam, Plan UK, Save the Children, Tearfund and World Vision.

The 14 charities have received more than £1.1billion of public money over the past three years - the bulk of it from the Government, the European Union and the United Nations.

Conservative MP Priti Patel said: ‘Hard-pressed taxpayers deserve to know how their money is being spent and will be shocked to see so many highly paid executives in charities that are dependent on public funds.

‘This money should be focused on delivering frontline services rather than lining the pockets of unaccountable charity executives.

‘As more public money is being given to charities to run services, they need to become more accountable to the public and subject to greater scrutiny and transparency.’

The Disasters Emergency Committee said it has run 62 appeals and raised more than £1.1billion since launching in 1963 - and insisted pay at the organisations was ‘broadly in line’ with other charities.

A DEC spokesman said: ‘The Disasters Emergency Committee plays no part in setting executive salaries at our member agencies but we believe these salaries are broadly in line with pay at other charities of comparable size.

‘To ensure the most effective use of appeal funds, a balance must be struck between minimising overheads and ensuring a robust management system is in place.

‘Good management of emergency responses in the UK allows our member agencies to deliver the planning, monitoring, accountability and transparency that this work requires and that the public rightly demands.

‘The proportion of DEC appeal funds that can be spent by member agencies on the UK management of their disaster responses is capped at seven per cent.

‘Over the past five years the DEC has raised over £193million for its appeals and the cost of raising those funds was less than four per cent of that total.’
