PC Richard Bent, 28, who admits the theft of £250 from a dead man and £93 from a lost bag handed into police by a posed member of the public

A police officer cousin of England footballer Darren Bent stole £250 from a flat where a man had died.

PC Richard Bent, 28, told a colleague: 'No disrespect, but he's dead', after swiping the bank notes from the central London home he was guarding.

Detectives investigating the sudden death of Rustam Cihhudy, asked Bent to collect medical notes from the Westminster flat, and the policeman took his chance to pocket the money.

When quizzed about the theft, Bent remarked: ‘No disrespect, but he’s dead. He wasn’t going anywhere soon.’

Bent, whose mother is the aunt of England and Aston Villa striker Darren, and who admits the theft, was based at Belgravia Police Station at the time of the theft on July 13 this year.

His colleagues set a trap for Bent as he returned to the station to book in the medical notes.

Bent was handed a lost bag by an undercover officer posing as a member of the public containing £93, which the PC promptly pocketed.

‘He is a serving police officer and the two thefts were committed while on duty’, prosecutor Emma Scheer told Westminster Magistrates Court today.

‘This is abuse of trust in relation to the fact he is a police officer, which is quite significant.’

Bent was arrested outside Bank tube station in central London, after skipping out of his shift early on July 13 to cash in his stolen money.

Ms Sheer said: ‘The £250 stolen was in old money and needed to be exchanged for new money.'

‘The first charge is a theft from a deceased person, Mr Cihhudy, while on duty providing cordon services.

‘PC Bent was positioned on the cordon guarding the property and obtained the keys to the property.

‘He took the medical notes that he was requested to do.’

Mr Cihhudy’s death was initially treated as suspicious after he collapsed unexpectedly at a flat in  Page Street, Westminster, but was later adjudged not to be a police matter.

‘It was discovered PC Bent had taken money from the bag and put it into his own bank account, before effectively discarding the bag’, said Ms Scheer.

‘At the time of the event, he didn’t know the person was an undercover police officer.’

Bent, wearing a shirt and tie covered with a black jumper, initially gave no indication of a plea and asked for the case to be transferred to the crown court.

But district judge Nicholas Evans insisted the case could be dealt with at the magistrates’ court.

‘No indication is really intended for those who are mentally unable to make up their minds’, he said.

‘I am not sure why it is done and what it is intended to achieve.’

He admitted two counts of theft - in respect of the £250 and £93 amounts - but denies swiping a bank statement, three cheque books, and a passport from Mr Cihhudy.

Bent, from Wandsworth, southwest London, was suspended from the Met Police when the accusations came to light.

Judge Evans ordered him to return for sentence on September 26 and released him on unconditional bail.

A decision will then be taken on how to deal with the allegations of stealing the passport, bank statement, and three cheque books.

Bent denies the claims which may now be dealt with as a separate allegation or resolved after a hearing.
