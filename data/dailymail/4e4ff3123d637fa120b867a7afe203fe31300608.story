That was a tough day. I feel dejected now and I will be until we train again because you build up in your mind what might happen and it was not to be.

Australia were very strong and their win percentage has been about 80 per cent for the last year, so they were favourites going into this first World Cup match — but we should have done better. However well you bat and bowl there is no real excuse when you field poorly because that’s something that is totally controlled by us.

So we let ourselves down a bit there and maybe that was a result of big-occasion nerves, which is understandable. People sometimes think of professional sportsmen as robots but if you put anyone under a high catch in front of 85,000 people it’s a nerve-racking experience.

Our big chance came when they were about 220-odd for five. We had our opportunities. But the death overs now are really hard work. If someone gets going there is always a boundary option and Glenn Maxwell and Brad Haddin played really nicely.

We just lacked a bit of killer extinct. Does that come with experience? It’s OK to make mistakes once but if we make them again it’s a problem, so Friday against New Zealand is a big day for us. 

Our two toughest games are our first two, there’s no doubt about that, so that even if, God forbid, we lose again it won’t be the end of the world but we need to improve a lot and we will be aiming to do that in time for our next game.

Doing it at the death

So what about our death bowling? Well, the talk at the MCG is that you have to try to make the batsmen hit square because it’s 64 metres straight and 84 metres wide. The guidance here is that it is best to stay on the short side.

Paceman Steven Finn was one of the England bowlers who felt the full force of the Australian onslaught

Here’s a stat for you. South Africa are the best in the world at death bowling and they go at an average of 5.8 runs as compared with our 8.0 in the last 10 overs. So what’s making them better? The world average is 30 to 40 per cent yorkers in those last overs in the modern game and what’s South Africa’s percentage? 12 per cent. They bowl length outside off-stump.

In Adelaide the plan will be to get the ball full and straight because it’s longer straight than wide. If the Aussies had bowled first in this game they would have bowled short, no doubt. With only four men out, it’s tough whatever you do, but we have to have a think because we can’t keep leaking 80, 90, 100 in the last 10 overs.

Taylor's tough luck

 I felt for James Taylor today. The game may have gone by the time Jimmy Anderson was given run-out, but a hundred against Australia at the MCG could be a life-changing experience and it’s sad that human error has denied him that. It’s clearly a grey area and they might have to think of balls like that as a let, like in tennis. Titch was very good about it afterwards, but it was a great shame for him.

Finn's hat-trick

It was great for Steven Finn to get a hat-trick. I’ve never felt under as much pressure under a catch as I was for the first dismissal of that hat-trick. I was getting so much stick from the crowd — worse than last year — and all I could hear as the ball went up was booing and jeering. Thankfully I kept hold of it!

Australian opener Aaron Finch was dropped on nought and went on to make 135

Keeping the faith

Everybody was gutted after the game. We know we’re better than that. It was always going to be a tough ask but we could have applied ourselves a lot better. But don’t lose the faith. This team has something about them.

The captain might be in the middle of a run of low scores but you just know with Eoin Morgan that when it really matters he could suddenly hit 60 and win you the game. He’s that sort of guy. A win on Friday would relax the camp but New Zealand on their own patch will be tough. We’re tight as a group. Everyone is together. We will find our way.
