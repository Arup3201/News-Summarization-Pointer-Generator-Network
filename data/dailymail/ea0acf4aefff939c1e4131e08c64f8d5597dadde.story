Zurich's drive-thru brothels have been hailed a success by Swiss social services, a year after they first opened.

The experiment in Switzerland's largest city began last August when the authorities opened Europe's first municipal drive-in brothel in an old industrial area.

It was hoped the initiative would slash the number of sex workers on the streets, while at the same time offering them a safer space to work. But not all of them are happy with the arrangements.

Privacy... Two empty so-called 'sex boxes' at Zurich's sex drive-in, which has been hailed a success by Swiss social services one year after it first opened in an industrial site in the west of the city

Authorities admitted that some have complained their earnings have fallen since the new initiative began, and that they are too far from city centre bars and clubs.

Running the drive-in, which cost around 2million euros ($2.6 million; £1.6million) to set up, has also proved more costly than originally thought.

Zurich's drive-thru brothel opened last August, with sex workers who agreed to move from their traditional haunts in the city centre allowed to ply their trade there safely and with a minimum of fuss.

The site to the west of the city boasts helpful signposts and understated wooden drive-in 'sex boxes' where customers can be served in relative privacy in the comfort of their own cars.

Sex workers agreeing to take part in the scheme did, however, have to get a permit and pay tax to avail of the drive-in's creature comforts, which include a laundry, showers and cafe.

They didn't have much choice in the matter. At the same time, Zurich launched a crackdown on unregulated prostitution and confined the oldest trade to just the drive-thru and two other zones.

City are officials are pleased with the results. 'The new regulation of street prostitution has attained its objectives of protecting the population and the sex workers,' they said in a statement.

Social services said that as well as protecting prostitutes, few neighbours were bothered by the comings and goings at the drive-in in the Altstetten district.

No increase in street walkers had been noticed in the two other districts of the city where prostitution is tolerated, they said.

Residents had risen up in protest at the number of prostitutes descending after dark on the Sihlquai, a main street near the city centre, and the authorities were worried about human trafficking if the trade was left unregulated.

'The first year of the service has been positive,' Zurich social services said in their statement.

The number of prostitutes working in the drive-in averaged 15 a night, half the number who worked the old red-light area before the city stepped in to regulate the business.

A spokesperson for the Sex Worker Open University, a group which campaigns for the rights of sex workers in the UK, told MailOnline that the initiative, while welcome, had its problems.

'Any initiative that truly makes selling sex safer would be welcome, but the "cleaning up" of areas where people engage in commercial sex is often in the interests of the public rather than the sex worker, who is often made more vulnerable by losing earnings and being "tucked away" out of sight,' she said.

'Sex worker rights advocates all over the world along with organisations such as World Health Organization, and UN Women all agree that full decriminalisation, rather than Swiss-style regulation and licensing, is the best human-rights based approach to keeping sex workers safe.'
