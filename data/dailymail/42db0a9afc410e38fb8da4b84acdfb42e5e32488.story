Former Newsnight Economics Editor Paul Mason claims that social networking websites may become a more reliable source of news than the BBC

The BBC is led by a ‘patrician elite’ that fails to listen to its audiences, one of its former editors has claimed.

Paul Mason – who was Newsnight’s economics editor for more than a decade - warned websites like Wikipedia and Twitter could soon become ‘more believable’ than BBC News because they are more receptive to corrections from readers.

And he blamed an outmoded management culture for preventing the corporation from changing with the times, saying senior executives are more worried about ‘messing up’ than producing interesting programmes.

Mason left the BBC in August to become culture and digital editor at rival broadcaster Channel 4. Before leaving, he used an interview with the BBC College of Journalism to launch a series of broadsides against his former employer.

The 53-year-old journalist – who published a novel last year – said: ‘Editorial leadership at the BBC has become more modern since I joined 12 years ago. A more diverse set of people now get to be editorial leaders. But the organisation can still feel like it is set up to be led by a kind of patrician elite.

‘There can be a jarring sometimes between newer, younger editorial management and the way the organisation responds to commands and requests.’

He added: ‘The danger sometimes is that the signals that come from the top are “don’t mess up,” sometimes put a bit more forcefully, whereas the signals should be from the outside world, saying “you’re not ordinary enough, you’re not believable enough, you’re not innovating enough.”

‘If I said one thing on leaving this building, it would be: “become more receptive to those signals”.’

During his time at the BBC, Mason was a vocal critic of the corporation’s programme of cuts.

Despite insisting the corporation still has a ‘global reputation for telling the truth and being impartial’, he warned it risked being overtaken by social networking sites.

He said: ‘To many people Wikipedia is news; Twitter is a news service. Our problem is when Wikipedia and Twitter become more believable than the BBC because they sound more authentic. Or because they are better peer-reviewed in real time: ‘that’s wrong, change it’. They are both subject to more peer-review than BBC output.’

He added: ‘The problem we’ve got as public service broadcasters, is to produce stuff that engages them as well as BBC content did with the 1950’s and 60’s generations…things that make them go “wow, that is so true, and so like my life that I’ve got to watch this every day”.’

Mason is the second senior BBC journalist to leave in recent months.

Last week, economics editor Stephanie Flanders announced she was leaving to become chief market strategist for JP Morgan Asset Management’s European unit on an estimated £400,000 salary.
