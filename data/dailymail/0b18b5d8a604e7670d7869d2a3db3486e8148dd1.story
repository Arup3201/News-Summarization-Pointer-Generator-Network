China has built an island fortress on a disputed reef, raising concerns over their military ambitions in the South China Sea.

Satellite images show that an artificial island with two piers, a helipad and a cement plant has appeared within the past nine months at Hughes Reef in the Spratly Islands.

China, the Philippines, Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei have all registered claims to the territory, leading to increased military tensions recently.

Original: The first satellite images, taken in March last year, showed the original 380 square metre platform that work started expanding from. US officials have described China's building expansion in the area as 'unprecedented'

Progress: Within months, staff had built an artificial island and dredged a channel as they prepared to develop the fort on the disputed Hughes Reef

Concern: The pictures, released by military analysis firm IHS Jane's, show the area has now been expanded to a 75,000 square metre fort amid concern that China can develop its navy, air force, coastguard and fishing fleets in the region

The pictures, released by military analysis firm IHS Jane's, has been expanded from 380 square metres to a 75,000 square metre fort  in the Union Banks region.

The reef is approximately 210 miles from the Philippines and 660 miles from China. 

Work originally began in March last year, and by the end of January, the original structure had been connected to the helipad. 

Pictures also showed that similar structures are being built at nearby Johnson South Reef and Gaven Reefs. 

Experts say the fortresses will allow the Chinese government to extend the range of its navy, air force, coastguard and fishing fleets in the region.  

American authorities have repeatedly asked China to stop their building projects in the region, which began after President Xi Jinping came to power three years ago. 

James Hardy, Asia Pacific Editor of IHS Jane's Defence Weekly, said: 'Where it used to have a few small concrete platforms, it now has full islands with helipads, airstrips, harbors and facilities to support large numbers of troops.

Military might: China's President Xi is expected to announce an increase in spending on the military next month

'We can see that this is a methodical, well-planned campaign to create a chain of air and sea capable fortresses across the center of the Spratly Islands chain.'

One western diplomat said: 'These reclamations are bigger and more ambitious than we all thought.

'On many different levels it's going to be exceptionally difficult to counter China in the South China Sea as this develops.'  

Last May, Chinese ships were accused of attacking Vietnamese vessels in the area, which is thought to be rich in oil and gas.

The Chinese have employed workers to build ports and fuel storage depots that experts say would allow Beijing to project power deep into the maritime heart of Southeast Asia.

A senior US official described China's building expansion in the area as 'unprecedented', and said: 'The Chinese have built up a head of steam on the land reclamation in the South China Sea over the course of 2014. If anything, it looks to be accelerating.'

President Xi is expected to announce an increase in spending on the military next month. 

Last year China's defence budget rose to approximately £85 billion, second only to the US in terms of total spend. 

In March last year, the Philippine government revealed concerns that China was carrying out land reclamation activities in the region.  

Japan has been strengthening its military might as tensions in the area mount, and last month announced a record £28 billion defence budget.
