Lighting storms are impressive displays of nature's power - but up until now scientists hadn’t realised that they could also sculpt mountains.

A team of researchers from Johannesburg recently discovered that a single lightning bolt could, for example, blow 
three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock.

This
 goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres 
(10,000ft) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years.

The discovery was made by Professor Stefan Grab while studying the Drakensberg mountains in Lesotho, southern Africa.

Previous theories claim that water melting and freezing inside cracks causes the rocks on mountains to break into pieces as they expand and break off. 

The Wind River Range, the Sierra Nevada and the Rocky Mountains were thought to have been shaped in this way, for example.

But unlike these formations, Professor
 Grab believes that lightning was the main cause behind the creation of 
the mountain landscapes in southern Africa

In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock

The hit: Lighning strickes the rock surface. The heat - which is around 27760 ºC - vapourises water that is stored in the cracks.

The explosion: The force of the vapourised water explosed the rocke, moving 10 tonnes of debris as far as 10 metres (30 feet) away. New cracks help to continue the process of weathering.

In Lesotho's Drakensberg mountains, for instance, the team found that a single lightning bolt could blow three to 10 cubic metres (100 to 350 cubic feet) out of bedrock.

This goes against the current assumptions that the peaks above 3,050 metres (10,000 feet) tend to break down over hundreds of thousands of years.

His team used a compass to prove their theory. ‘A compass needle always points to magnetic north,’ said Professor Grab's colleague Professor Jasper Knight. 

‘But
 when you pass a compass over a land’s surface, if the minerals in the 
rock have a strong enough magnetic field, the compass will read the 
magnetic field of the rock, which corresponds to when it was formed.

‘In the Drakensburg, there are a lot of basalt rocks which contain a lot of magnetic minerals, so they’ve got a very strong magnetic signal.’

If a compass is passed over an area where a lightning strike occurred, its needle will suddenly swing through 360 degrees.

‘The energy of the lightning hitting the land’s surface can, for a short time, partially melt the rock and when the rock cools down again,’ added

‘It takes on the magnetic imprint of today’s magnetic field, not the magnetic field of millions of years ago when the rock was originally formed.’

Because of the movement of continents, magnetic north for the newly formed rock will be different from that of the older rock around it.

Professor Knight and Professor Grab mapped out the distribution of lightning strikes in the Drakensburg and discovered that lightning significantly controls the evolution of the mountain landscapes because it helps to shape the summit areas with this blasting effect.

Previously, angular debris was assumed to have been created by changes typical of cold, glacial environments, such as fracturing due to frost.

Water enters cracks in rocks and when it freezes, it expands, causing the rocks to split apart.

‘Many
 people have considered mountains to be pretty passive agents, just 
sitting there to be affected by cold climates over these long periods of
 time,’ said Professor Knight.

‘This
 evidence suggests that that is completely wrong. African mountain 
landscapes sometimes evolve very quickly and very dramatically over 
short periods of time. These are actually very sensitive environments 
and we need to know more about them.’

The research team also attempted to quantify how much debris was moved by such blasts, which can cause boulders weighing several tonnes to move tens of metres.

The stability of the land’s surface has important implications for the people living near the mountains. ‘If we have lots of debris being generated it’s going to flow down slope and this is associated with hazards such as landslides,’ said Professor Knight.

Mountains are also inextricably linked to food security and water supply. In Lesotho, a country crucial to South Africa’s water supply, food shortages are leading to overgrazing, exposing the rock surface and making mountain landscapes even more vulnerable to weathering by lightning.

Professor Knight hopes the research will help to put in place monitoring and mitigation to try and counteract some of the effects.

‘The more we increase our understanding, the more we are able to do something about it,’ he said.

This is said to be due to temperature changes in the mountainous rock

They proved their theory by monitoring changes on a compass needle

This suggests the mountains evolved 'very quickly and very dramatically'
