A Texas elementary school bus driver was caught on camera last week mocking a crying little girl and even inviting the other students to join in.

The Floresville driver, who students called Ms. Pat, is not longer employed in the school district after video footage of her cruel and unusual behavior was aired by a local news station.

The footage shows Ms. Pat calling the girl 'crybaby' and pretending to wail as she goads the kids to join in.

Disgraceful: This south Texas school bus driver (in surveillance footage at left) who kids call Ms. Pat is no longer on the job after she taunted a crying little girl and had the other children join

'Cry...cry...cry...' Ms. Pat taunts on the video as the little girl, who's remained anonymous and not pictured along with the rest of the kids, continues to sob.

Ms. Pat asks the other kids to join her as she blurts, 'Ready?....I want my mama! Waaaah.'

KSAT obtained the almost unbelievable footage, which they aired Tuesday.

At the time, Ms. Pat was still employed with the district and driver her normal route.

Floresville school superintendent Dr. Sherri Bays admonished the driver's behavior in an interview with KSAT.

'I was very concerned with that and it's definitely not appropriate,' Bays said. 'I think she's acting very childish and immature.'

After some very public scrutiny of her employee, Ms. Pat is no longer on the job.

ABC News was able to report Wednesday that Ms. Pat has left the job, though it is unclear whether she's been fired.
