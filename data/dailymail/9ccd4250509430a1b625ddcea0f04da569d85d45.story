The heavily pregnant wife of Denver Bronco's start Eric Decker could be living it up in a luxury suite at Sunday's Super Bowl, but she has said she's determined to sit in the touchdown zone to get the best view of her hubby.

Jessie James Decker is eight months pregnant, but she is making sure that she as close to the action as possible in order to see her man play the game of his life.

In an interview with the New York Post, Decker's brave wife said she was offered box seats but even though she's ready to pop she wanted to see as much of her wide receiver husband as possible.

Pitch-side: It could be 35 degrees on Super Bowl Sunday, but that won't stop Jessie James Decker from making sure she's close to the action instead of being comfortable in a luxury box seat. She wants to see her man, Eric Decker, play up close and personal

About to pop: Jessie James Decker is eight-months pregnant and passed up box seats so she could be as close to her Broncos wide reciever husband as possible

Decker, 26, has become one of 
the breakout stars of the Denver Broncos with career highs for both the 
number of receptions he made and the number of receiving yards.

'Eric could have put me in the box but
 I just wanted to be as close as possible. This is a once-in-a-lifetime 
opportunity and I am not going to miss the chance to see my husband 
score a touchdown right there,' the 25-year-old country music singer 
said.

Her husband tried to change her mind with the of being in the warmth. She turned down his offer. Sitting only a few rows from the action sounds better to her.

'He really wanted me to sit in the box to protect myself from the weather and everything. He keeps trying. He sent a text to me yesterday writing 'Are you sure, baby, are you sure you don't want to sit in the box?''

Determined: Even after her hubby tried to change her mind with the toasty comfort of sitting indoors, she turned down his offer. Sitting only a few rows from the action sounded better to her

'I'm like, 'No. I'm going to be out there. I want to smell the sweat. I want to see your face,'' she said.

While flying from Los Angeles to Nashville last week, James had a big health scare as her heart rate shot up to almost twice the normal rate, she said.

An ambulance rushed her to the hospital, where doctors diagnosed her with a bad case of the flu.

'It was very scary ... But I rested for a couple days. I went back to Denver, packed for New York and here I am. So it's been a whirlwind,' she said.

Thermal underwear will be worn, including a heavy North Face coat and boots as James prepares to bundle up and face the elements.

On her first night in New York, James passed on a yacht party that other football wives attended so she could chill out in her cozy Manhattan hotel room.

'This is one of the most incredible things you could imagine happening for your significant other: going to the Super Bowl. This is really, really special,' she said.

Valuable asset: Decker had two career highs this year and the Broncos will face the Seahawks at this weekends Superbowl
