It's a problem all bird-lovers will relate to - you go out and buy expensive seeds and leave them out in your feeders - only for a greedy squirrel to come along and steal the lot.

But a Utah couple have come up with an ingenious solution, which involves turning their feeder into a squirrel slip'n'slide.

Robert and Nancy Krampf, from Johnson Canyon, were being constantly thwarted by one particularly plump critter, which would run up the pole to their bird feeder and make off all of their seeds stored in its cheeks.

Slipping away: The greedy squirrel has been thwarted by Robert and Nancy Krampf's simple Vaseline trick

But by adding Vaseline to the pole, they have not only made a lot of hungry birds very happy, they have also created a hilarious YouTube hit.

The video shows the persistent squirrel trying time and time again to clamber up the greasy pole, only to slide all the way back down every time.

It tries several different tactics, including working its way up slowly from the bottom and taking running leaps at the pole, but no matter what, the result is always the same.

Mr Krampf posted as the caption to the video: 'The Rock Squirrel has been raiding our bird feeder, carrying away pounds of seed. Nancy figured a quick solution. I don't know which is funnier, the squirrel or Nancy's narration.

'For anyone who is concerned about the squirrel, he still raids our other two feeders and the vegetable garden. The tiny amount of Vaseline used is non-toxic, the kind used for lip balm. He quickly learned that this feeder was not worth the trouble, so we have not put more on the pole, and the birds are delighted to actually get some of the bird seed.'

The couple laugh hysterically as they watch the poor squirrel's failed thieving attempts, while Mrs Krampf adds sound effects and comments: 'He's not going to give up, is he?' 

Mr Krampf runs a website called 'The Happy Scientist', on which he posts entertaining and informative videos teaching people about everything from rocks to rubber bands, as well as performing experiments. 

On the squirrel video, he said: 'You could find some science in it if you think about friction, animal behavior, etc., but most people enjoy it because of Nancy's funny narrative and sound effects.'
