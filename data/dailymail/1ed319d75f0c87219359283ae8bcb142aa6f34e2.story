Cold weather sweeping through the Northeast and Midwest is causing widespread disruption today - tearing the roof of the Pontiac Silverdome to pieces along the way.

Up to 12 inches of snow is expected across the Midwest and Upstate New York with temperatures 10 to 30 degrees below average across the two regions, according to the Weather Channel.

In Detroit high winds claimed the inflatable roof of the Pontiac Silverdome.

Empty: The Lions last played at the Pontiac in 2002. The stadium owners said they deflated the roof in early January ahead of its renovation. They said damage caused by today's storms had given no cause for concern

Several holes were ripped into the roof of the former home of the Detroit Lions - it had already been deflated as part of a renovation plan and officials said they were unconcerned by the damage, according to the Detroit Free Press.

A snow band is currently across the northeast with three inches of snow expected for the Syracruse area and a further foot headed there on Thursday.

A further winter weather system is also expected to hit the Northeast on Friday.

Erie, Pennsylvania has already exceeded all records with 16.3 inches of snow falling on Monday alone making it its snowiest day in January on record, according to the Weather Channel.

More than a foot is expected in Ashtabula, Ohio and Jamestown, New York today.

A pile-up, caused by icy roads took place outside Cincinnati yesterday involving at least 86 vehicles that left a 12-year-old girl dead.

The crash on Interstate 275 near the Cincinnati suburb of Colerain Township was one of at least four pileups that snared dozens of vehicles.

Colder: Much of the Midwest will turn colder again on Thursday according to forecasts with heavy snowfall expected across the region

The freezing weather has caused three separate highway pileups involving dozens of vehicles in Ohio. This multi-car crash on Interstate 275 left about 20 people injured.

Officers were called to the scene shortly after 11:30 am and discovered multiple chain-reaction collisions.

The 12-year-old girl had gotten out of a damaged vehicle and was standing in the median near a cable barrier, a type of fencing made of rope-like steel wire cables, the Hamilton County sheriff's office said.

Another vehicle hit the barrier, snapping a cable, which then struck the girl and killed her, office spokesman Jim Knapp said.

At least 20 people were taken to hospitals, though their injuries were not expected to be life-threatening, the office said.

Snowfall: Duane Kniskern of Pine Bush, N.Y. ices fishes on Glenmere Lake in Florida, New York. Snow is expected to fall again across the area on Thursday

Tony Bambenek fishes on East Lake Winona in Minnesota. Ice on the lake is around 10 inches thick. Bambenek told the Winona Daily News: 'I like this weather. It's better than 20 below. I wouldn't be out here if it was that cold.'

Part of the sudden cold surge was down to a system dubbed Winter Storm Jove.

It brought the wind chill factor to around minus 50 in Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

In Detroit, around 120,000 customers lost power over the weekend as high winds knocked down electricity lines.
