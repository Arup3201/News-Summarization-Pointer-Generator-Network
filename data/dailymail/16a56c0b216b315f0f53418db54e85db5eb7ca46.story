Almost every man in Britain who is diagnosed with testicular cancer is now beating the disease, figures reveal.

More than 96 per cent of those treated today are still alive after 10 years, compared with fewer than 70 per cent in the 1970s, says Cancer Research UK.

Although there is a slim chance of the disease returning, patients who have survived for more than a decade are considered effectively cured.

The charity claims the result is down to its success in developing the chemotherapy drug cisplatin.

The treatment, at the centre of which is an atom of the element platinum, is hailed as a ‘shining example’ of achievement through research.

Cancer Research chief executive Dr Harpal Kumar said the word cure is now ‘almost a reality’ for some types of cancer.

‘But it’s important we recognise the four per cent who aren’t surviving the disease, as well as the fact that we still need treatments to be kinder to patients in the future,’ he added.

‘It’s only by doing more research that we can bring forward the day when we are able to beat all types  of cancer.’

Testicular cancer strikes about 2,300 men in the UK every year.

Unlike many other forms of the disease, it tends to occur at a relatively young age and is now the most common cancer in men aged 15 to 49.

Men are urged not to ignore early warning signs, the most common of which is a lump or swelling in one of the testicles.

Martin Ledwick, the charity’s head information nurse, said: ‘Although most lumps in the testicle won’t turn out to be cancer, it’s important you get symptoms checked out as early as possible as this gives the best chance of cure.

'Get used to how your testicles look and 
feel normally and if you if you notice a lump, swelling or persistent 
discomfort then go and see your GP.

'Cancer Research UK has a leaflet about 
what to look out for, which you can download from the website. You can 
also call the charity’s information nurses on freephone 0808 800 4040 if
you have any questions.'
