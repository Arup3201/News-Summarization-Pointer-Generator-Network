The cream of the Royal Air Force, they climb, swoop and split the cloudless skies as they have done for almost 50 years.

These stunning photographs show the British Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team - better known as the Red Arrows - on fine form above the RAF Akrotiri base in Cyprus.

Complete with their refitted Hawk jets - now sporting a Union flag on the tailfin - the nine-pilot team was today awarded their right to display.

The team makes its first performance in Falmouth, Cornwall, this Saturday and continues across the UK and Europe for the rest of the summer.

New look: In honour of the 50th anniversary, the Hawk jet planes have all been given a Union flag on their tailfin

Climbing high: The pilots have been practising their daring formations over Cyrpus for months

Manoeuvre: The Red Arrows have long been held up as an international example of excellence in the skies

Formation: After receiving their Public Display Authority, the pilots were allowed to swap from green overalls to red
