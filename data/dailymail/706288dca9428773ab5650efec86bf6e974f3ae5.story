By the time transfer deadline day arrived, Tom Cleverley’s career had reached a crossroads in every sense. Aston Villa or Everton. Sadly, his journey through the ranks at Manchester United had reached a dead end.

Forced to train with the reserves at Carrington last week after manager Louis van Gaal took him to one side and informed him that the imminent arrival of Daley Blind would further limit his first-team opportunities, Cleverley knew his time was up after 14 years at the club.

Little more than a month after Van Gaal handed him the honour of captaining United for the first time against Roma on pre-season tour in Denver, the England midfielder had joined the list of players earmarked for the Old Trafford exit.

Cleverley’s subsequent departure was a little messy, to say the least. He was halfway down the M6 en route to undergo a medical at Villa on Monday after United accepted a £7.5million bid when Everton attempted to hijack the deal. That fell flat when their offer of £5.5m was rejected by United chief Ed Woodward, and Villa rushed through a loan move that was only ratified by the Premier League on Tuesday afternoon.

It is safe to assume that those first fraught phone calls from Villa boss Paul Lambert and his assistant Roy Keane were less than polite. However, when the dust settles and Cleverley adjusts to his new environment at Villa Park, he may come to the conclusion that this is a not a bad career move after all.

His once burgeoning reputation has taken something of a battering over the past 12 months. A player whose selfless contribution to the team was not always appreciated by supporters who demanded more from those wearing a United shirt became a prime target during United’s alarming decline under David Moyes. Played out of position and then not at all by the Scot, his confidence dipped.

The situation took a poisonous turn in February when an online petition was set up calling for him to be axed from the England squad. Publicly, Roy Hodgson stood by Cleverley but it was perhaps no surprise that the combination of events meant that he did not go to the World Cup in Brazil.

Although Van Gaal’s reputation as a coach who likes to build from within and work with younger players initially augured well for his future at United, the club’s spectacular £150m summer spending spree told otherwise. Cleverley and his old friend Danny Welbeck were out as United turned to big-name signings like Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on astronomical wages of £280,000-a-week.

That is 10 times more than Cleverley earned at Old Trafford but some still accused him of greed for haggling over his personal terms with Villa. At the age of 25, however, he knows that his next contract is likely to be the most important of his career.

Where that will be remains to be seen. He will spend the rest of the season at Villa who have an option to renew their £7.5m offer in January. It is unlikely that Everton will have been discouraged by their unsuccessful attempt to sign him on Monday.

Unlike Welbeck, who will earn in excess of £100,000-a-week following his £16m move to Arsenal, Cleverley has had to take a step back. In the long run, it may turn out to be a blessing in disguise.

The important thing is to get his mind back on playing football at a club where he will be given every chance to shine. A player who first made his mark away from United on loan at Leicester City, Watford and Wigan must do so again.

Keane knows a thing or two about leaving United and the Irishman could be a key figure in Cleverley’s rehabilitation at Villa. The former Old Trafford skipper will relish the opportunity to rebuild the midfielder’s confidence and develop his game. This, after all, was a young man who was frequently tipped for stardom by Sir Alex Ferguson.

Cleverley, who was 11-years-old when he chose Old Trafford ahead of Leeds and Blackburn, has proved United wrong before. Their academy coaches thought that he would be too small to make the grade, but he went on to play a total of 79 games for the first-team.

Even though Cleverley and United have now gone their separate ways, it’s by no means the end of the road.
