Food writer Katherine Whiteman died in a road accident less than an hour after landing in Argentina

A top food writer, who edited books featuring recipes from Raymond Blanc and Pierre Koffman, died after being thrown from a car in an accident less than an hour after she landed in Argentina.

Katherine Whiteman, 63, was thrown through the window after the car she was travelling in with her barrister husband Peter Whiteman QC and a translator hit a verge and somersaulted.

She died on the road after the car landed on top of her and continued to roll.

In a statement, Mr Whiteman, a corporate barrister, said that he began frantically searching for his wife was after the car came to a halt on National Highway 231.

He said: 'I began to desperately ask where she was. I looked around the car and saw my wife lying face down, losing a lot of blood.

"I took my wife's wrist to take her pulse, but I never managed to get one.'

Less than an hour earlier the couple had landed at Bariloche Airport and had hired a driver to take them to their hotel in Villa La Angostura.

Mr Whiteman's statement said that the car had skidded a number of times and the driver had repeatedly swerved to avoid oncoming traffic in the lead up to the crash.

He said: ‘Some 15 minutes before the accident I noticed the driver, on four or five occasions, was taking corners at speeds of about 110km an hour.’

The vehicle flipped several times and performed a barrel-roll after hitting a verge, skidding on its side before coming to a rest on all four tyres.

Southwark Coroner's Court heard that Mr Whiteman, who specialises in all areas of corporate and commercial tax, and the interpreter had to climb out of the cars broken windows as the doors were jammed shut following the crash.

They moved Mrs Whiteman because she appeared to be choking on her own blood, but by the time the emergency services arrived, she had died.

Mrs Whiteman, who was born in Hampstead, north London, was pronounced dead at around 2pm on January 4, 2009.

Following an investigation by Argentinean authorities, her body was repatriated to the UK.

The investigations revealed that the driver of the silver Volkswagen Golf, Fabian Peyregne, had been driving at a dangerous speed of at least 71.3km an hour.

He was found to have caused death by negligent driving and received a two year suspended sentence.

Coroner Andrew Harris said: ‘The evidence suggests that she was only alive for a few minutes and died on the road side having been thrown out of the car from which the other three people exited through the window.

‘It is clear from the report that the car skidded, left the road and somersaulted.

‘The speed at which that vehicle was going was not safe. The driver was charged and found guilty of death by negligence.’

Dr Harris recorded that Mrs Whiteman of Dulwich, southeast London, died of multiple injuries. He ruled that her death was an accident.

Mrs Whiteman, a member of the Guild of Food Writers, was the author of several books, including Brittany Gastronomique, The Italian Cook, Love Food Love Paris and The World Encyclopedia of Fish and Shellfish.

She was inspired to get into cooking by her Italian grandmother and her early career saw her work on the Supercook partwork, which featured a mix of 3,000 different recipes.

She was also the editor of two of the most significant books on French cuisine published in this country - Raymond Blanc’s Recipes from Le Manoir aux Quat’ Saisons and Pierre Koffmann’s Memories of Gascony.

She worked on 11 books with legendary chef Michel Roux, whom she introduced herself to at the Waterside Inn in Bray, and wrote some 30 books in her own right.

As well as working on books, the former BBC production editor was a restaurant inspector for the Good Food Guide and a prominent member of the Food Writer's Guild.

Mrs Whiteman, a graduate in French and Italian at Trinity College in Dublin, supported several campaigns including the Guild of Food Writer's Hospital Campaign.

In a eulogy read at Mrs Whiteman's funeral by her husband he described her as 'unique' and 'full of fun'.

He added: 'Her knowledge of food, ingredients, recipes and cooking techniques was encyclopaedic.

'The books she wrote were a joy to read, the recipes were always easy to follow, and they worked – according to all of those who tried them out. Her meals and hospitality were legendary – the food she prepared was exquisite.

'For all her talents and qualities, Kate was a truly modest person. She was also totally genuine, extremely intelligent and full of common sense.

'She was, of course, elegant, glamorous, charming, graceful, sensitive and so very kind. She was warm, compassionate, loving, vibrant and radiant.'

She is survived by her husband, Peter and two daughters, Victoria and Caroline.

Widower Mr Whiteman is recommended as a leading silk in his field in Chambers UK, where he is praised for his 'flair and bravery in court.'

The barrister was described as 'the brightest man at the bar' by Tatler magazine.
