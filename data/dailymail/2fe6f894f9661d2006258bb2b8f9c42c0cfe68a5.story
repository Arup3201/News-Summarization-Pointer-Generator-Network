A six-year-old girl was plucked to safety by firefighters after nearly throttling herself when she fell through the railings of her balcony in southern China.

Qing Yuan Tai trapped her head between two steel bars that would have choked her if she'd lost a precarious toe-hold on a support bracket.

Frantic neighbours in Wenzhou, Zhejiang province, dialed 999 while they tried to stop the girl being strangled or breaking her neck.

'She was frightened and in a lot of pain. If she'd slipped or lost her grip with her feet she would have been dead pretty quickly,' said a spokesman.
