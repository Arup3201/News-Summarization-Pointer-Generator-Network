Accused: Marcos Ortega, 33, allegedly smashed into Moeller while he was walking on the side of the road

A man who was allegedly hit by a drunk driver and dragged for a mile and a half down the road stuck in his windshield has died.

Kenneth Moeller, 61, was hit in Ocean Township, New Jersey, last week and sustained such horrific injuries that he had to have a leg amputated in hospital.

Police say Marcos Ortega, 33, was behind the wheel - and kept on driving with Moeller lodged in his battered windshield until officers pulled him over.

Ortega was first charged with driving under the influence and causing serious bodily injury, but is likely to face more serious accusations now that Moeller has died, NJ.com reported.

According to invesigators, Moeller, from Lanoka Harbor, was walking on the shoulder of the highway when Ortega veered into him. 

Ortega remained jailed Tuesday on $150,000 cash bail. It's not known whether he has retained an attorney.

The accident occurred November 10 on Route 9 in Ocean Township.

Prosecutors said a township police officer responding to reports of an erratic driver saw what appeared to be a person lying on the hood of a vehicle.

The officer stopped the vehicle and, as he approached it, saw the victim lodged halfway through the windshield.

Samples of Ortega's blood were collected for analysis, but the tests have not been completed.

Death: Moeller was being treated at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, where his leg was amputated in an unsuccessful bid to save him
