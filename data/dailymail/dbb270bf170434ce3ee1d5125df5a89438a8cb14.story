A Chinese restaurant has removed two naked 50ft statues of Buddha from its roof just two days after putting them up because they offended believers.

The statues were a reference to a old Chinese wives' tale involving Buddhist monks, which features one of them scrambling over a wall to try some soup.

Buddhist followers, known for their 
peaceful ways, were so angered by their religions leader being used as an advert that they began protesting
 outside the eatery, demanding the figures be taken down.

Li Tsui has removed two 50ft naked Buddha statues from the roof of his restaurant just two days after putting them up because they offended local Buddhists

The images were a reference to an old Chinese wives' tale, in which a Buddhist monk jumps over a wall to try some soup. A poet supposedly remarked that Buddha himself would have done the same

According to the legend a scholar 
travelling by foot used to carry ingredients for the soup in a clay pot,
 and heat them up when he stopped for rest.

The story goes that while warming the dish near a Buddhist temple, one of the monks could not resist the smell and jumped over a wall to try it, causing a poet among them to remark that Buddha himself would have done the same.

Li Tsui, who owns the restaurant in Jinan, in China's Shangdong province, said: 'I didn't intend to offend anyone and in fact there is a very popular dish that we also make here known as Fotiaoqiang, which is extremely popular in this part of the world and everybody eats it.

There are various different versions of the tale, but it is thought to be a fake designed to help sell Fotiaoqiang soup - served at Mr Tsui's restaurant - which translates as 'Buddha leaps off the wall'

Buddhist followers were said to be so angry at the depiction of their spiritual leader climbing over the building that normally pacifist followers started protesting outside

'The dish translates as "Buddha leaps off
 the wall". I simply meant to advertise that and as everybody knows the 
dish didn't think that would be a problem.'

While different versions of the story are told across the whole of China, it is likely to be made up as a marketing trick in order to sell the expensive meal.

Recipes for the soup also differ, but usually include a variety of expensive ingredients, such as venison, shark fin, sea cucumber, shiitake mushrooms, herbs such as ginseng and wolfberries, Shaoxing rice wine, bamboo shoots, pork, duck, quail's eggs and stock.

Mr Tsui has since apologised, saying that because the dish was popular he thought the statues wouldn't offend anyone

The ingredients are combined in a large clay pot, covered with wine and stock and then boiled very slowly for a long time.

It is a delicacy which is not widely available, and must usually be bought from specialist restaurants, such as the one owned by Mr Tsui.
