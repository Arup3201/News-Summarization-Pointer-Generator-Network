Rihanna accompanied Chris Brown to court Wednesday morning for his probation hearing.

The 24-year-old singer, who recently admitted she was back together with the R&B star, followed him into the Los Angeles courthouse for his latest hearing stemming from his 2009 assault of her.

According to sources on TMZ, Rihanna 'blew Chris a kiss and said some supportive words to him before he entered the courtroom.'

Heading to court: Rihanna accompanied Chris Brown to court with his mother Joyce Hawkins as he prepared for another probation hearing

Brown was in court to hear allegations from the Los Angeles prosecutors office that he may have lied about completing his community service.

TMZ reports the judge ordered Brown to meet with his probation officer in Los Angeles within 48 hours to discuss the allegations.

The judge scheduled another hearing on April 5 due to needing 'more time' to review the evidence presented by Los Angeles prosecutors. He also needs to speak to the probation officers.

Rihanna, 24 and Brown, 23, then left the courtroom 'arm in arm' with Brown looking 'dejected,' added TMZ.

Earlier, the couple had left Brown's home together with the star carrying his suit under his arm.

Rihanna wore sunglasses and kept her head 
down with her long hair partially covering her face.

The
couple were also accompanied by Brown's mother Joyce Hawkins amid 
allegations that Brown  'lied about completing community service hours,'
which formed part of his probation deal.

Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos and the Richmond Virginia Police Department have vociferously denied the allegations.

Mr Geragos gave a news conference 
after the hearing on Wednesday where he said: 'I have never had a client
who has been tortured like Chris Brown has.'

He added that Rihanna had been in court to 'support' Brown and was unimpressed with the allegations. 

'[She's] completely supportive,' he said. 'She thinks it's utterly ridiculous to him.'

Expressing his fury at the District Attorney's Office, Mr Geragos said: 'The D.A. is paralysed with the thought 
his probation will be terminated.  If that happens they won't be able to
jock him around like they've been jocking him around.'

More time: Brown will have to return to court on April 5 for another hearing

Brown was in court following allegations by L.A. prosecutors on Tuesday that there is no credible evidence he 
completed his community service sentence for beating Rihanna, and citing
several other incidents that they say point to anger management issues with the singer.

The Los 
Angeles County district attorney's office filed a motion which focuses on issues with
Brown's community labour in Virginia, citing numerous discrepancies and 
claiming the R&B singer was essentially  unsupervised.

Brown
is reported by E! News to have slammed the allegations on his Instagram
account, writing: 'I can handle the hate but enough is enough yo! 'Im a
human being and I honestly think I deserve respect i'm sick of being 
accused…I'm just tired of this sh**.

'A day in my shoes is a day in hell,' he added.

Meanwhile, a source told Radar that an attorney for the Richmond Police Department has sent a letter to Los Angeles prosecutors stating they are 'completely in the wrong when it comes 
to their claims about Chris’s community service.'

Mr Geragos is also said to be filing a
motion to Tuesday's motion insisting 'there is solid evidence that 
Chris didn't lie and that he fully complied with his probation and 
community service obligations.

TMZ reports Geragos' filing also includes 'invoices and checks indicating Chris paid $31,534.70 to the Richmond PD for providing security during his labor details'. The District Attorney claims Chris did not pay such a sum.

An insider meanwhile told Radar: 'Richmond P.D. is extremely upset about the allegations and believe that 
prosecutors are just ignoring the facts. Separately, several 
firefighters have voluntarily contacted Geragos and said they witnessed 
Chris performing his community service hours.

'Chris is ready to face the

has nothing to hide.'

On Tuesday, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey claimed: 'Chris Brown failed to provide "credible or verifiable 
evidence"' that he completed his court ordered community labour.

Mr Geragos labelled the filing 'frivolous and defamatory', and added he planned on seeking sanctions against prosecutors.

'The motion filed by the DA's office is 
shameful and a disgrace,' Mr Geragos said. 'In essence, it calls everyone a
liar in the Richmond Police Department and the Virginia Probation 
Department.'

He claimed prosecutors ignored interviews 'where 
sworn peace officers stated unequivocally that Mr Brown was supervised 
and did all of the community service.'

He added: 'I plan on asking for 
sanctions from the DA's office for filing in frivolous, scurrilous and 
frankly defamatory motion.'

A spokeswoman for the district 
attorney's office declined to comment on Mr Geragos's statement.

The prosecution's motion also notes several incidents in which Brown lost his temper, including throwing a chair through a window after a
Good Morning America interview in which he was asked about his assault 
of Rihanna on the eve of the 2009 Grammy Awards.

The
report cites Brown's recent fight with R&B singer Frank Ocean, 
including Ocean's allegation that Brown 'threatened to shoot him in the 
brawl over a parking space,' according to a police report of the 
incident.

Ocean suffered cuts on his right index finger and minor cuts to his left temple.

Police officials say they
are unlikely to seek charges against Brown for fight with Ocean, after 
Ocean posted online that he does not intend to seek criminal or civil 
penalties.

Judge Patricia Schnegg ordered Brown 
to 
perform 180 days of community service after he accepted a plea deal of 
community labour, five years' formal probation and domestic violence 
counselling back in 2009.

The new prosecutor's motion asks the judge to order the singer to repeat his entire 180-day service 
sentence in Los Angeles. Brown had been given permission to perform 
clean up and manual labour duties in his home state of Virginia.

But LA prosecution 
investigators claim they found no evidence he completed his work as ordered.

Richmond Virginia police chief Bryan Norwood was tasked with supervising Brown and submitted paperwork last year indicating the singer had completed his sentence.

However, prosecutors allege there are
numerous shortcomings and possible misstatements in those records, 
which show the singer performing double shifts in the city and at a day 
care centre where his mother once worked.

'This
inquiry provided no credible, competent or verifiable evidence that 
defendant Brown performed his community labour as presented to this 
court,' Deputy District Attorney Mary Murray writes in the filings.

She alleges that the records submitted by Norwood are 'at best sloppy documentation and at worst fraudulent reporting.'

Richmond
police spokesman Gene Lepley declined to discuss the allegations, 
saying: 'We believe it would be inappropriate to comment on a matter 
that's before the court.'

According to the motion, officials 
with Virginia's probation office told investigators that Brown's 
arrangement to be supervised by Norwood was 'extremely unusual' and had 
not been approved by the agency. No one from Virginia's probation 
department oversaw Brown's hours, the filing states.

The
motion notes that the only records the department has to indicate Brown
was supervised were officers' overtime sheets. But five of 21 days that
officers logged overtime for Brown were spent providing security for 
the singer's concerts.

Around one-third of Brown's community hours were logged at a daycare centre where the singer spent time as a child and where his mother once served as director, it has been reported.

The prosecution motion says a 
detective checked on Brown on only nine occasions when he was working 
there. Each time, the singer was found at the centre, accompanied by his
mother and a bodyguard but no law enforcement personnel.

Chris Brown left his home with a tub of  Bronner Brothers Super Gro Hair Aid on Wednesday, prompting speculation that the 23-year-old R&B star is worried about hair loss.

The product is is rich in various proteins, sulphur, and sage, contains vitamins, mineral and coconut oils, and promises to 'relieve itchy scalps, splitting ends, and promote healthy hair with an abundance of rich minerals and nutrients.'

It is not clear whether the hair loss product is for Brown himself, or why he needed it as he headed to his probation hearing at a Los Angeles court.

The star usually wears his hair in a short, cropped style, but is often seen sporting a baseball hat or trilby.
