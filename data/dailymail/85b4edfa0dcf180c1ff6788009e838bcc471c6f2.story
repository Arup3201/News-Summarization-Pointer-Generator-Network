It is the most exclusive spot on the Riviera, a playground for the rich and famous. But Cannes this week hosted a less glamorous crowd.

Scores of officials from at least 68 British councils and quangos were in the French resort for an international property conference – or ‘taxpayer-funded jolly’, in the words of critics.

The four-day MIPIM 2014 event brings together investors, property moguls, developers and investment bankers who do business over glasses of champagne amid the sea views.

It started on Tuesday at the InterContinental Carlton, where rooms can cost thousands of pounds a night, with a huge fireworks display and party on the beach.

Property developers and investment banks hosted champagne receptions on yachts, and stalls in the conference centre offered wine and canapes to passing visitors.

Not to be outdone, the 235 local council representatives took over bars and restaurants and partied the long, warm nights away. One told the Daily Mail: ‘This certainly beats working. I’ve sent pictures of the beach to my partner telling her I’m working hard.’

During the day, attendees enjoyed long rosé-fuelled business lunches of huge plates of seafood.

The cost of rooms in Cannes last week was such that many private sector workers had to stay in cheaper destinations down the coast. By Tuesday there was not a room to be had in any of the hotels in the entire city or a seat in any of its expensive restaurants.

Most councils sent only two or three representatives, but there were some notable exceptions. Leicester and Leicestershire Enterprise Partnership sent 11, the same number as the City of London Corporation. The enterprise partnership for Derby, Derbyshire, Nottingham and Nottinghamshire sent 20, and Sheffield City Council and Sheffield City Region sent ten.

The Marketing Manchester quango sent 16 people, while Manchester City Council sent three. The Manchester delegation, which also included representatives of Manchester International Festival, had its headquarters at a bar in a central location. Free drinks were served on at least one of the nights during a Manchester City game on the bar’s TV. The drinks, like the rent for the bar, were funded by private sector partners.

The council’s chief executive Sir Howard Bernstein and some staff stayed at the luxurious Gray d’Albion hotel, where rooms can cost £400 a night, paid for by the organisers of the event.

The Manchester delegation later hosted a private party paid for by the private sector at a villa in another prime Cannes spot.

Earlier that day it hosted a reception for footballer-turned-property developer Gary Neville at which he announced plans to build a hotel with former teammate Ryan Giggs.

Team Nottingham, the delegation from Nottingham, took over as its headquarters the top floor of a bar overlooking the beach, paid for by private sector partners.

Manchester City Council said the cost of its attendance to the taxpayer was £50,000 but claimed the return in private sector support would be five times higher.

A council spokesman said: ‘Manchester, in common with all of Europe’s major cities including London whose presence was led by the Mayor of London, sent a private-public delegation with over 50 companies to MIPIM to attract investment and jobs.’

Jonathan Isaby of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘This conference is little more than a fancy taxpayer-funded get-together for council officers and companies in the French Riviera. When councils are putting up taxes and failing to cut waste, many residents will wonder why on earth they are paying to send this many local politicians on a jolly to Cannes.

‘If this so-called conference is of such benefit to local businesses then they would surely be happy to fund the entire trip themselves, rather than relying on hard-pressed residents for more money.’
