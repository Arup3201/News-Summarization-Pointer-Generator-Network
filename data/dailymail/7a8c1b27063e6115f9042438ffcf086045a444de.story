A newly revealed scrapbook shows an insider's view of how Winston Churchill was laid to rest in a tiny Oxfordshire village almost exactly 50 years ago - in a grave which this week has become the focus of commemoration for the great man.

The collection of photographs is owned by 91-year-old Frank Hall, who was a verger at St Martin's church in Bladon, where the wartime Prime Minister was buried.

They show preparations for the burial - including Mr Hall mowing the grass around the grave plot and servicemen rehearsing the lowering of Churchill's coffin.

Other pictures reveal how crowds of people descended on the village for the service, whose 50th anniversary falls on Friday, and members of the public queued for hours for a glimpse of the great man's grave.

Today, the public again returned to the Bladon churchyard to pay tribute to the man who led the Allies to victory over Hitler's Germany in the Second World War. 

Mr Hall was responsible for taking care of the wreaths left at Churchill's grave by his family, and the sea of flowers donated by mourners in the following weeks.

He received a letter from the statesman's widow Clementine thanking him for 'looking after my husband's grave', and the note is also in his historic scrapbook.

Mr Hall has now donated the book to an exhibition at Churchill's birthplace, Blenheim Palace, which is situated in the town of Woodstock not far from Bladon.

The former Prime Minister's state funeral in January 1965 took place at St Paul's Cathedral in London before his body was taken to St Martin's via train.

The funeral rehearsal depicted in Mr Hall's scrapbook was held two days before the actual ceremony.

Mr Hall was a verger at St Martin's between 1961 and 1969 and now lives in the nearby village of Stonesfield with his wife Jean.

'It was always known that Winston Churchill would be buried at Bladon but it never really occurred to me that I might be involved in it,' he said as he revealed his scrapbook for the first time.

'He always said he knew whereabouts he was going to be buried because there was a plot left for him.

Preparations: Frank Hall, a verger at St Martin's who has kept this scrapbook for 50 years, mowing the grass in the graveyard

Grave: The plot which had been prepared for Churchill in the graveyard at Bladon, near his birthplace of Blenheim Palace

Plot: The grave was dug in the Churchill family plot when the wartime Prime Minister died aged 90 in January 1965

Final journey: Churchill's body was transported from St Paul's Cathedral in London to Oxfordshire on this train

Waiting: Hanborough railway station, where the train stopped so that Churchill's body could be taken to Bladon by car

'The burial was at 3pm and the police closed off the village at 10am to people. Lady Churchill wanted it to be private and it was from the point of the lychgate at the church.

'There were about 30 people around the grave, mostly family. I was at the graveside for the burial, in the corner by the church tower.

'All I had to do was stand there and wait until they had moved on and then the grave diggers came and filled the grave in.

'I had to put the wreaths left by Lady Churchill and the Queen out before all the visitors came.

'The police let the photographers in for 10 minutes and then the crowds started coming and that went on until midnight.

Media: These 10 phone boxes were installed for members of the Press to file their reports - conveniently close to the village pub

'The following day the crowds were back. People parked a mile away from the church. I remember speaking to a father carrying a small child who had queued for three hours to see the grave.

'They kept on coming for six weeks and my job was to put the new flowers down and take away the old ones.'

Mr Hall had previously met Churchill 20 years earlier, while serving with the 6th Airborne Division in the Second World War.

His regiment had just crossed the Rhine into Germany in April 1945 when the Prime Minister arrived in a jeep alongside Field Marshal Montgomery.

Crowds: Hundreds if not thousands of members of the public queued up after the burial to pay their respects to Churchill

Queue: Villagers were willing to wait hours for a glimpse of Churchill's final resting place

Night: The mourners continued to come until well after dark, testament to the affection in which Churchill was held by the public

Love: A wreath from Churchill's wife Clementine, who signed herself 'Clemmie', was placed on his grave

Mr Hall, who fought in the Battle of Normandy in June 1944 and the Battle of the Bulge in 1945, said: 'He had a trilby hat on and a cigar in his mouth and he gave his V for victory sign.'

After being demobbed in 1947, Mr Hall worked as a delivery driver and then for for a local sand and gravel company before becoming a verger at St Martin's.

The Churchill Exhibition at Blenheim Palace will open on February 14.

Tribute: Robert F. Kennedy, brother of the murdered President JFK, visited Churchill's grave in 1967

Letter: When Mr Hall retired as verger at the church, Mrs Churchill thanked him for looking after the grave
