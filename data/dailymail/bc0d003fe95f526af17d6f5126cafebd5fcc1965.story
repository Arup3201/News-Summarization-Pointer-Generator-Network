Researchers think they have found the wreck of the iconic Civil War 
vessel the Planter — the Confederate ammunition ship commandeered by the
 slave Robert Smalls, who steamed it out of Charleston and surrendered 
it to the Union Navy.

Archaeologists with the National Marne 
Sanctuary Program said Tuesday they have found what is thought to be the
 wreck of the side wheel steamer buried under about 15 feet of sand just
 offshore at Cape Romain, northeast of Charleston.

They released a report outlining their findings on the anniversary of the day in 1862 when Smalls took the vessel.

Smalls
 would return to Charleston a year later to pilot a Union ironclad in an
 attack on Fort Sumter. After the war, he served in the South Carolina 
General Assembly, the U.S. Congress and as a federal customs inspector.

Bruce
 Terrell, a maritime archaeologist and historian, said scientists used 
old maps and newspaper accounts to identify the general area where the 
Planter was thought to have wrecked in a storm in 1876, eleven years 
after the war ended.

Using a magnetometer, an instrument that can 
detect metal beneath the ground, they found a number of metal objects 
seeming to correspond to the wreck.

The report said more studies will be
 needed before the wreck can be positively identified.

The 
Planter, built in 1860, wrecked when a storm came up as it was trying to
 tow a grounded schooner back to sea at Cape Romain. In the following 
days, many items on board were salvaged.

'We're not sure how much 
was left of the Planter because contemporary accounts indicate it was 
pretty well stripped down — all the way to the cushions and blankets and
 doors,' Terrell said. 'It looks like the engines and the paddlewheels 
were taken out.'

The items buried in the sand could be the boilers
 because they would have been corroded by the salt water and not much 
good for salvage after the Planter sank, Terrell added.

Smalls was
 born in the Beaufort area and became a river pilot in Charleston in the
 1850s. He was later conscripted by the Confederates to serve as a pilot
 on the Planter.

Smalls took the Planter early on the morning of 
May 13, 2014, after the Confederate officers aboard left the ship for a 
night in town.

He steamed upriver to pick up family and friends, 
then turned around and slipped past five Southern batteries on 
Charleston Harbor to reach Union blockade ships.
