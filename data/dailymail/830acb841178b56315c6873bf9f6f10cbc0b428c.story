Rapist: Hamidullah Hamidi should have been deported in November, but stayed in the UK and raped a 14-year-old

An illegal immigrant dragged a teenage girl with learning difficulties from the streets and raped her in his home - a month after a warrant had been issued to have him deported.

Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, tempted his 'extremely vulnerable' 14-year-old victim from outside a shop in Bristol by offering her money.

He took the girl - who has a mental age of seven - to a deserted street before dragging her home, locking her inside and raping her, a court heard.

Hamidi has now been jailed for six years after admitting one count of rape at Bristol Crown Court.

The court heard that Hamidi, an Afghan national, fled his home country as a child to avoid fighting for the Taliban and was raised by a foster family in Britain.

He was given limited leave to stay in the country, which he exceeded, leading to a warrant being issued to have him deported.

Hamidi was supposed to leave the UK last November, but was still in the country on December 8 when the attack took place.

Judge Michael Longman said that Hamidi would serve half his prison sentence before being deported.

Sentencing, he said: 'Your victim was just 14 at the time when you raped her. She was plainly an extremely vulnerable girl.

'You saw her in the shop and left and waited for her to come out. You offered her money as a lure and she accompanied you.

'You led her physically to your home address where you locked her in and raped her. When she was able to leave and make off, you followed her until you were stopped from doing so. You caused her severe psychological harm.'

The court was told Hamidi’s victim suffers from significant learning difficulties and intellectually functions at the level of a seven-year-old child.

Overstayer: Bristol Crown Court heard how a warrant had been issued for Hamidi's deportation

Prosecuting, Giles Nelson said Hamidi was classed as an 'overstayer', with attempts to deport him made at his home on November 11 last year.

'The following month, on December 8, his victim went to a shop in Easton,' Mr Nelson said.

'The defendant was in the shop and is seen to leave the shop then wait outside for the victim to emerge, which she did.

'The defendant offered to give her money, she agreed and went with the defendant. He grabbed her and pulled her along with him.

'She was trying to stop him but couldn’t and there was no one else there.'

Hamidi dragged the girl to his home and locked her inside before raping her, Mr Nelson said.

The girl later told police: 'I said "Can you stop, please" but he wasn’t having it.'

Hamidi eventually allowed the girl to leave the property and she fled, before approaching members of the public on a nearby street for help.

'She was seen to be extremely frightened indeed,' Mr Nelson added. 'Her mother says that she has had no sexual encounters and has been left with severe psychological harm.'

Hamidi was arrested by police on December 11 and initially denied the attack but later admitted it in court. Representing Hamidi, Stephen Mooney said his client was still appreciating 'the enormity of what he has done'.

'He came to this country from Afghanistan to prevent him from being sent to fight for the Taliban,' Mr Mooney said.

'His father had sympathies for the organisation. His mother did not share those views.'

Mr Mooney said Hamidi had been placed within a foster family in Britain and attended college.

'He has thrown away all that he has in this country,' Mr Mooney added.

Hamidi, who wore grey tracksuit bottoms and a black jumper in court, remained emotionless as the sentence was passed.
