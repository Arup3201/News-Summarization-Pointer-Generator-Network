A man has admitted going on a JCB rampage - causing £300k worth of damage to the recycling plant where he worked.

Trevor Lewis, 59, wreaked havoc when he used the digger to go on a systematic 'rampage' at the Eastwood Recycling Centre in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, on Saturday, July 19.

Lewis, a site contractor for SITA UK, appeared at Calderdale Magistrates Court this morning where he pleaded guilty to a charge of criminal damage.

Destruction: The yellow JCB, which appears to be smoking, and a trail of decimated wooden and metal fences at a recycling plant where Trevor Lewis, 59, went on a 'rampage'

Torched: A porta-cabin that was set ablaze during the July 19 incident

The court heard Lewis had bought £15 worth of diesel before arriving at the depot, which he used to set a porta-cabin on the site alight.

He then destroyed everything he could, tearing down railing and fencing, crushing yards of steelworks.

Armed police had to be called in to try and contain the situation, after workers arrived at work to meet devastation, the court was told.

The court heard Lewis, of Mayroyd, West Yorkshire, had been depressed after suffering an injury to his knee

Lewis was given unconditional bail and will next appear at Bradford Crown Court for sentencing on  August 27

He arrived at court with a family member and spoke only to confirm his name and enter a plea.

Lewis was given unconditional bail and will next appear at Bradford Crown Court for sentencing on Wednesday, August 27.

The recycling centre, which had only just been reopened following a £600k upgrade, will be closed until at least November as repair works are carried out.
