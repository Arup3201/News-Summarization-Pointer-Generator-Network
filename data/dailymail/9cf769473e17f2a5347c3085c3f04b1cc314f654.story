Accused: Amy Belliveau allegedly had a relationship with a 'high functioning' special needs student

A 43-year-old married special education teacher has been arrested for allegedly having a sexual relationship with one of her students.

Amy Belliveau, who was in her first year of teaching for the district in Newington, Connecticut, allegedly had sexual contact with the 20-year-old student between April and June this year.

It is against state law for a school employee to have sexual contact with a student, regardless of the student's age. Officials described the pupil as a 'high-functioning' special needs student.

An investigation into her conduct was launched after a tip from the school district on June 13.

She was placed on administrative leave from Newington Transitional Academy when the investigation was launched and she was fired following her arrest.

Schools Superintendent William C. 
Collins told the Hartford Courant that the district worked jointly with police after they began to
 suspect a sexual relationship had occurred.

He said he was 'thrilled' that an arrest had been made in the case.

On Thursday, Belliveau turned herself in after learning a warrant had been issued for her arrest.

Scene: She was investigated after her school in Newington, Connecticut tipped off police in July

She has been charged with eight counts of second-degree sexual assault. She posted bail and will be back in court on October 9.

Belliveau, who lives in New Britain, has been married to husband Peter since 1997 and they have two children.

Although it was her first year with the district, records show that Belliveau began teaching elementary school and high school art classes after receiving her Connecticut Teacherâ€™s Certification in 1996.

The school teaches life skills to 18- to 21-year-old students with varying needs.

Former Newington elementary school teacher Soldelis Garcia told FoxCT: 'We try so hard to work with our students and to have one of our colleagues to do something like that is just sad.

'Parents entrust us with their children and then that trust is taken away [by something like this] and it gives us a bad stigma.'
