Molly Wei, who spied on Tyler Clementi's romantic encounter with another man, testified Tuesday that she was 'overwhelmed with sadness' when police told her he was missing and had likely committed suicide.

Wei is the star prosecution witness in the trial of Dharun Ravi, who is accused of invading Clementi's privacy by recording the Rutgers University freshman in the dorm room they shared in 2010. The 19-year-old has known Ravi since middle school and two friend watched Clementi with his male companion on a computer in her room.

Wei's testimony was the first mention of Clementi's suicide at the trial in three days of testimony. The prosecution has made the case about the 15 charges Ravi faces for the secret video recording, not about whether those actions drove Clementi to jump off the George Washington Bridge.

Wei, 19, said campus police called her, then picked her up in an unmarked car after class in New Brunswick, New Jersey, on September 23, 2010 — after Clementi went missing.

At
first, she said, she was nervous about being told to get into a beige 
Cadillac and texted her boyfriend at another school to get in touch with
police if he didn't hear from her within several hours.

She said that what she learned there rattled her so much that she had her parents take her home for the night.

'At
the end of the conversation, the police officers told me that Tyler was
missing and that he had possibly committed suicide,' she said.

'I was sad, overwhelmed. I felt very bad if anything had happened. I just was overwhelmed with emotions of sadness. I just felt so bad for what happened.'

Wei was charged and arrested initially but entered a
program that will allow her to keep her record clean if she meets a 
list of conditions, including doing community service, working or 
attending school full-time.

She
also agreed to cooperate with authorities and testify truthfully in 
Ravi's trial. She said she has completed about 250 of the 300 hours of 
community service required.

However, Ravi's lawyer, Steven Altman, pushed Wei to admit that police made an error when she was at first charged with broadcasting and recording the encounter.

She said Ravi streamed the video to her computer, but never recorded it or posted it to the wider Internet.

On Monday, Wei testified that Ravi texted her multiple times as she was being interviewed by police and told her to make the webcam video broadcast seem like an accident.

‘I think that he thought we were going to get in trouble, so he wanted to make it seem like it was more of an accident,’ she told the court.

Both she and defendant Dharun Ravi, who turned 20 today, viewed the web images of Ravi’s roommate, 18-year-old Tyler Clementi.

She said Ravi was worried about what she was telling police, and asked her multiple times via text message what exactly she revealed to them.

‘Did you tell them we did it on purpose? What did you tell them when they asked why we turned it on? I said we were just messing around with the camera,’ Ravi said in some of his messages, ABC News reported.

Wei responded saying that she told investigators ‘everything’ that happened the night of September 19, 2010 when Ravi set up a webcam in his and Clementi’s room after Clementi asked to have the room for himself.

Clementi jumped to his death from the George Washington Bridge days after that, as the rumours abounded that he was gay.

Wei also testified Monday that she agreed to keep it a secret because it was so shocking to see the images - but that it wasn't under wraps for long.

‘First of all, it was shocking. It felt wrong. We didn't expect to see that. And now that what we did, it was like we shouldn't have seen it,’ Wei told the jurors.

‘We didn't want people to know what had happened.’

But within minutes, she testified, she and defendant Dharun Ravi were online chatting with friends about seeing two men kissing.

Within the hour, Ms Wei said, she agreed to show a few seconds of the video stream to four other women who visited her dorm room.

Still, she said, Ravi did not intend to humiliate his roommate. Ravi faces 15 criminal counts, including invasion of privacy and bias intimidation.

To convict him of bias intimidation- the most serious charge he faces- prosecutors would have to persuade jurors that Mr Ravi acted out of bias toward gays.

Unlike other more casually dressed 
college students who have testified so far in the trial, Ms Wei wore a 
black business suit.

And unlike the others, she kept her voice audible 
even during the most uncomfortable moments.

She said that she invited Ravi, whom 
she had known since middle school, to her dorm room for a snack a few 
minutes after 9pm on September 19, 2010.

When Ravi tried to go back, 
she said, Mr Clementi told him that he wanted the cramped dorm room to 
himself for a few hours. So Ravi returned.

Within a few minutes, she said, he 
used her computer to view live images from his webcam. It was then, she 
said, that she saw about two seconds of Mr Clementi and an older man 
kissing.

Even though she said they initially 
agreed not to talk about what they had seen, she asked Ravi to tell a
friend about it during an online chat that began at 9.20pm and within 
minutes, word got around the dorm.

She said she agreed to turn the webcam back on at the request of a woman who was among a group dropped by her room.

‘It was the exact same image, except that they had taken their tops off,’ she said. ‘As soon as they saw it, I turned it off.’

Ms Wei was expected to be back on the witness stand for more cross-examination on Tuesday.

Also Monday, jurors heard from university official William O'Brien that Mr Clementi requested a room change about 30 hours after the alleged spying - and a day before he killed himself.

Mr O'Brien, associate director of residence life at Rutgers, told jurors that his staff did not see Mr Clementi's request for a new roommate until after he was reported missing from campus.
