On the surface, the story behind Derby County’s remarkable march to the play-off final is a simple one.

Nigel Clough was sacked as manager last September with the team languishing in 14th place, following four mediocre seasons finishing in the middle to lower reaches of the Championship.

In came former player and coach Steve McClaren who waved his magic wand – or some such action to that effect – and Derby were galvanised into a run of seven successive wins that propelled them into the top two.

Visionary: Steve McClaren has impressed Derby supporters with his attacking style

Ousted: The Derby board eventually lost patience with Nigel Clough after no signs of improvement

Images of a wally with a brolly were quickly banished as the free-scoring team retained their promotion push, and they go into Saturday’s final as justifiable favourites to beat a far more expensive and experienced QPR side.

It is a neat and tidy narrative and one that the club’s owners have been keen to promote, but such a simple interpretation grossly undervalues the diligent work done by the previous manager over the preceding four-and-a-half years.

For while McClaren has undoubtedly brought purpose and direction to a young and energetic collection of players, there is no escaping the fact this is ultimately Nigel Clough’s squad – one that he patiently assembled under very trying circumstances.

Nine of the 11 players likely to start at Wembley were either bought or nurtured by Clough, and the two great hallmarks of the team – a tight spirit built on humility and an attractive passing style – were very deliberately promoted by the previous regime.

In truth, Derby’s rise is not an overnight transformation but one that has been brewing for some time. It is necessary to rewind back to January 2009, when Clough was appointed manager, to appreciate the firm foundations upon which McClaren has sculpted his impressive team.

Clough took over a club in crisis, one in danger of sinking into the third tier of English football less than two years after dropping out of the Premier League.

The American owners were realistic about the dire finances and set the son of Derby’s most famous manager the arduous task of rebuilding the club from top to bottom on a shoestring budget.

Big earners and prima donnas were ditched and the manager was forced to work with players from the academy and lower leagues.

But he did so with a clear long-term vision behind his careful actions. Only hungry, hardworking and humble players would be allowed to wear the shirt.

One of the first signings, Jake Buxton, was initially derided as little more than a pub player when he arrived from Burton Albion. But his wholehearted and unselfish performances at centre half showed the path to a strong team spirit, and he is now a cult hero among fans.

Goals: Chris Martin was Derby's top scorer with 22 league goals

While some of Clough’s signings were born with such character, others were given the chance to reinvent themselves by joining this collective ethic.

Chris Martin, previously convicted of assault and banned from 68 Suffolk pubs, was plucked from Norwich last year on a free transfer and told to step up to the responsibility of becoming a proper No 9. He is now the key and focus of all Derby’s attacking play, scoring 25 of the team’s goals this season, 22 of them in the league, and assisting in most of the others.

Allied to these signings were a clutch of youngsters promoted from the club’s restructured academy, most notably the much-coveted Will Hughes.

Two years ago Clough recognised in the slender 17-year-old the courage to receive the ball in any situation and attempt to dominate possession. The team subsequently evolved around the teenager’s vision and one-touch passing, and finally began playing the sort of football befitting a side managed by a man called Clough.

Progress may have been frustratingly slow but this season began with public pronouncements of finishing in the top six, and some of the early signs – a 5-1 away thrashing of Millwall and a glorious goal after a 26-pass move at Yeovil – were promising.

But consistency remained elusive and the board lost patience after a 1-0 loss to local rivals Nottingham Forest in September, the third defeat in eight days.

While Clough’s sacking was undoubtedly harsh, but the bold decision to hand Steve McClaren the task of fulfilling the team’s potential has been vindicated in spectacular fashion.

McClaren has repeatedly acknowledged his great inheritance at Derby, and perhaps the most remarkable aspect of his success is that it is built on no more than minor tinkering and fine-tuning.

It may well have been the case that Clough was too close to his project, and a fresh pair of eyes was needed to make the small – but significant – changes that have propelled Derby up the league table.

Wise move: Liverpool's Andre Wisdom has been very impressive on loan

While Clough’s team had a tendency to over-elaborate and sometimes keep the ball for the sake of it, McClaren’s charges play with more urgency and forward momentum.

While Clough’s desire to pick his best 11 footballers often meant putting square pegs in round holes, McClaren has fitted the players into a clear 4-3-3 formation.

And while Clough was inherently cautious and would try to preserve a 1-0 lead, McClaren encourages his players to cast off their inhibitions and chase more goals.

He has also been far bolder with substitutions and tactical changes, rescuing many points from seemingly hopeless causes by making an early switch in matches to playing four up front.

Records: Craig Bryson has had a breakthrough season in midfield, with 16 league goals

But beyond this the team is largely unchanged, with only minor changes in personnel – most notably the Liverpool loanee Andre Wisdon bringing solidity to a leaky defence and George Thorne borrowed from West Brom to fill the crucial holding midfield position.

It is tempting to wonder whether this very same success would have been overseen by Clough, had he been granted more time to see his work come to fruition?

Or perhaps it did actually require someone with the experience and insight of McClaren to accelerate the team’s development by instilling greater positivity and self-belief?

It may even be the case that Derby did Clough a favour by jolting him out of his complacent comfort zone in the town where he grew up, for he is now enjoying at Sheffield United the sort of rapid success that eluded him in his previous job. It is possible he just needed to be liberated from the giant shadow cast by his father’s unmatchable accomplishments at Derby.

The management change has also brought a chance of redemption for McClaren, whose image was tarnished by failure in charge of England, a sacking at Wolfsburg and resignations from Nottingham Forest and FC Twente, not to mention the comical local accent he adopted while managing in Holland.

He is now flourishing back among those who love him and rediscovering what an excellent manager he can be at the club where he first experienced English football’s top tier as a player and coach.

If he returns Derby to the Premier League he will deserve all the plaudits that come his way, but he knows the achievement will rest above all on having the good sense to recognise – where others did not – the many fine attributes in the team built by his predecessor.
