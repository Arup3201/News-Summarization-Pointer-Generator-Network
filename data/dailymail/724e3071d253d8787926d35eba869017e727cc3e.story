QPR have announced they will not be taking disciplinary action against Steven Caulker over the incident that left the defender requiring hospital treatment.

Caulker suffered a cut to his head amid reports he was involved in a brawl at a London pub on Sunday afternoon with players from Crystal Palace also present at the social event.

QPR say Caulker, who is available for Monday night's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton, was wounded after falling over and have opted against punishing the 22-year-old.

The incident is said to have occurred at the Ship Inn, in Wandsworth, London

Manager Harry Redknapp insists the bid for top flight survival remains intact despite the incident that occurred just hours after the club had moved out of the relegation zone with a second victory in three matches.

'A few of the players went out for Sunday lunch, it was only a small group. I didn't stop them going, they were quite entitled to do that,' Redknapp said.

'I've always said I've got no time for footballers going out and having a jolly over Christmas because it's a busy time of year.

'But they went for Sunday lunch, it wasn't a Christmas party. If it was, then all the players would have gone.

'There were Crystal Palace players there as well apparently, so it wasn't a club thing. It was just a few lads who decided to have some lunch together.

'Steven fell over, don't ask me how.....I wasn't there and can't be with them 24 hours a day. He fell over somehow and got a cut on his head but is OK now.

'Has it damaged anything? No, it certainly hasn't damaged anything. It was only one lad who ended up having a problem, fell over and banged his head. The rest of them.....not a problem

'I certainly didn't think it warranted front page headlines. Surely there are more important things going on than Steven Caulker falling over and banging his head.

'We move on, it's done and dusted now. There wasn't a problem with the rest of the lads and we get ready for Monday's game against Everton.'

Redknapp denies having made approaches for strikers Robbie Keane or Jermain Defoe, both of whom worked with the 67-year-old when he was manager of Tottenham and now play in Major League Soccer.

'Robbie's an amazing footballer, one of the best professionals I've come across. He's gone over there and been the best player in the league, he hasn't gone there for a holiday,' Redknapp said.

'But he belongs to the LA Galaxy and is the star man of their team and league. We've never made an enquiry about him. They wouldn't let him go.

'I've never spoken to Jermain. I asked about him in the summer, but he was too expensive and the club wouldn't let him go anyway. He's a top player.'
