A young British holidaymaker was killed by a stray bullet at a New Year’s beach party in a popular Thai tourist destination.

City trader Stephen Ashton, 22, was dancing on the sand when he was caught in crossfire following a fight between two groups of Thai men.

Despite frantic efforts by his distraught friends and other revellers, he died soon afterwards at a local hospital.

Mr Ashton, who is understood to have been on holiday with five friends, had travelled to one of the top locations on young Britons’ gap year wishlist – Haad Rin beach on Koh Phangan island.

The resort has long been famed for its monthly ‘full moon’ parties, as well as its New Year festivities.

Hippy travellers have been followed by growing numbers of affluent young  Britons fresh out of school or university, although the Foreign Office warns visitors to take care because of problems with roving criminal gangs.

Mr Ashton, who lived with his mother Diane in a £1million house in Purley, Surrey, was simply enjoying the festivities at the Zoom beach bar when tragedy struck.

According to local reports, 300 tourists were dancing shortly after 4am on New Year’s Day when two groups of Thai men, each half a dozen strong, began arguing, then fist-fighting.

As one of the groups fled the bar, one man turned back and fired a gun, leading to panic.

One bullet struck Mr Ashton in the torso, causing devastating  injuries.

After first aid by partygoers failed, he was sent to the Ban Don hospital nearby, which has only elementary surgical  facilities, and was later pronounced dead.

Local police officer Lieutenant Colonel Somsak Noorod said: ‘He was shot in the side while he was dancing on the beach.’

Thai police named their suspect as Ekkapan Kaewkla, 26, and arrested him yesterday afternoon in remote hills in the centre of the island.

He is said to have had a home-made gun, which was allegedly the weapon used.

Shock: The beach was packed full of people celebrating New Year's Eve when the incident happened

Killed: Mr Ashton was at a New Year party on one of Thailand's most famous islands

He was reported to have admitted being in the fight, but denied firing the fatal shot.

Colonel Kittakarn Kramothong, head of the island’s police station, said: ‘Stephen was not involved in the fight. The gun used was home-made.’

Mr Ashton had been staying at the Pink Bungalow complex nearby with his friends.

Just a fortnight ago he had posted on Facebook a photograph of himself and two companions in a Thai bar.

His father John died suddenly aged around 50 about a year ago.

A childhood friend last night told how he had given up work to nurse his father, who suffered a terminal illness.

Zak Gorman, 22, said: ‘All I can say is Stephen was a top bloke.

'He was a barrister’s clerk and then started work in the City trading derivatives, but he quit his job to look after his father.’

He had returned to work last year.

Mrs Ashton, 48, was on her own New Year holiday abroad and was last night understood to be on her way to formally identify her son’s body in Thailand.

Other relatives at the family home yesterday were too upset to discuss their loss.

A former neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ‘It is so tragic. It is just Diane and her daughter Emily left now.’

Last night a Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the death of a British national in Thailand. We are providing consular assistance to the family.’

Haad Rin beach on Koh Phangan island, off the east coast of Thailand, was once a tranquil hippy secret.

Over the last three decades, however, it has gained growing fame for its Full Moon parties – which can now take place pretty much any time – with blaring Western dance music.

The hedonistic atmosphere of Haad Rin beach is thought to have inspired the hit film The Beach, starring Leonardo Di Caprio and Tilda Swinton, and the original book of the same name by British author Alex Garland.

Its backpacker hero leaves a resort similar to Haad Rin for a secret island utopia populated by young Western travellers with access to unlimited marijuana.

In the real Koh Phangan, there are young tourists experimenting with drugs, but many simply head there for the cheap beer and dance music parties.

The Foreign Office has warned of problems at the beach, including sexual assaults, drownings involving swimmers high on drugs and attacks by local gangs.
