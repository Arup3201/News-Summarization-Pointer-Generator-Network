A paedophile described as 'predatory' who used two children to act out a 'real life pornographic film' has been jailed for 15 years today. 

Ian Hodkinson groomed the parents of an 11-year-old girl so they trusted him to look after her before raping her with an accomplice, who was just 13.

Judge Norman Wright told Liverpool Crown Court that the girl, who had been using the computer in Hodkinson's bedroom, left to go to the toilet before Hodkinson started having sex with the boy so she would see them when she returned.

'She didn't complain or flee as an adult might have done.

'She looked on you as a friend. You had groomed her well,' said Judge Wright.

The 41-year-old then sexually assaulted and raped her before ordering the young boy to do the same.

Hodkinson, from Wigan, denied the charges along with his co-accused, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, but both were found guilty at a trial at Liverpool Crown Court.

Hodkinson was also found guilty of six charges of sexual assault including one on a ten-year-old boy in a separate incident, inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, rape of a child and attempted rape.

The judge ordered that he is on extended licence for six years for public protection.

He banned him from working with children and ordered him to sign the Sex Offenders Register for life. 

The court heard that he has a previous sexual assault conviction.

The juvenile defendant was placed under supervision for two years and was made the subject of a youth rehabilitation order for two sexual assaults and an attempted rape. 

The judge said: 'You looked up to him and did what he said. 

'You probably still do not appreciate the effect he has had upon you. He made you do this not for your gratification, but for his.'
