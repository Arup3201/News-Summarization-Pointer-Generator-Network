Response: Jeremy Hunt took to Twitter to dismiss claims that there are plans to allow ambulance waiting times to double as ‘scaremongering’

Jeremy Hunt was accused of ‘moving the goalposts’ yesterday as a row erupted over plans to allow ambulance response times to more than double.

The Health Secretary described the claims as ‘scaremongering’, but a leaked NHS memo revealed proposals to increase maximum permissible waiting times for some serious calls from eight to 19 minutes.

Senior doctors said the plans ‘risked lives’ and Labour accused Mr Hunt of making a ‘panic decision’ in the face of a winter NHS crisis.

But last night it emerged that Labour and the Liberal Democrats had been informed of the plans up to three months ago and had not raised any objections.

The Association of Ambulance Chief Executives, which wrote the document, said in a statement it was ‘surprised’ by the reaction.

It said that ‘over the last three months the principles of what we are proposing and the benefits for patients that we envisage have been shared with Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrats and we have received no negative feedback on the thrust of those principles’.

The statement added: ‘At this stage, these are only proposals and they will not be formally approved until NHS England and the Secretary of State are convinced … that they are clinically safe and that they offer better care for our patients.’

The Association pointed out that half of call-outs are categorised as ‘life-threatening’, but only one in ten actually are.

Bosses believe relaxing targets – so the eight-minute response time only applies to these calls – would mean more lives could be saved.

The ambulance service in England and Wales is under severe strain and has consistently missed response time targets for the most serious cases since April.

In some regions the volume of calls is 15 per cent higher compared with last year

Officials blame an increasing tendency of patients to dial 999 first instead of trying to arrange an appointment with a GP.

The most serious ambulance calls are categorised as either Red 1, such as cardiac arrests, or Red 2, which are slightly less serious but still life-threatening, including strokes, breathing difficulties or blood clots.

Currently, ambulances have to respond to both Red 1 and Red 2 call-outs within eight minutes.

But the leaked document suggested raising the waiting time for some Red 2 call-outs to 19 minutes. It was drawn up by the Association, dated last Monday, and clearly stated that the proposals had been ‘approved by the Secretary of State’. It added that the target date for implementing the proposals was the first week of January.

However, Mr Hunt took to Twitter to dismiss the claims as ‘scaremongering’, saying he ‘categorically refutes’ them. He wrote: ‘No plans to double ambulance waiting times, and there never have been.’

But one ambulance service director, who asked not to be named, told BBC News: ‘This is being done for political expediency rather than patient safety … with the full blessing of Jeremy Hunt. This is being pushed through with limited consultation with the chief executives and the health service as a whole.’

The document states that a small proportion of the most serious Red 2 calls would be upgraded to Red 1.

Of the remaining Red 2 cases, just under half would keep the eight-minute target – but would be given an extra three minutes before the clock started, to help staff classify the call.

All other Red 2 cases would have a 19-minute target, and the clock would not start until three minutes after the call is received.

Yesterday Professor Keith Willett, NHS national director for acute care, said ‘nothing had been agreed’ – and that the plans would not take effect next month.

He told BBC Radio 4’s The World This Weekend: ‘If it is not clinically sound then it is not going to progress.’ Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the plans suggest Jeremy Hunt’s solution to the A&E crisis is to ‘give up and move the goalposts’.

He added: ‘People will struggle to understand how, in the middle of a crisis, it makes sense for the Government to make a panic decision to relax 999 standards and leave patients waiting even longer.’

Mr Burnham has written to the Health Secretary asking why the measures were not disclosed to Parliament days after he signed them off.

Professor Sir Roger Boyle, the Government’s former adviser on heart disease, said the plans were ‘going down a very dangerous path, and will risk lives … it’s an admission of defeat’.

Rising numbers of 18 to 34-year-olds are heading straight for A&E as they cannot get convenient appointments with a GP, according to a report.

They are twice as likely to attend casualty units and walk-in centres compared with over-55s.

Analysis of the official GP patients’ survey by the House of Commons library found there were 37.4million failed attempts to book an appointment with GPs last year, affecting 4.7million patients.

The research into young adults was carried out by Citizens Advice and found one in seven people aged 18-34 could not see a GP last time they tried to make an appointment, compared with just one in 17 aged 55 or over.

Only 30 per cent of the younger patients found their experience of GPs to be ‘very good,’ compared with 64 per cent of patients over 75. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said failure to treat younger people outside hospital would add to the financial pressures on the NHS.

‘GP services need to keep up with 21st-century lifestyles,’ she said. ‘With many younger adults out at work, it can be difficult for them to get an appointment with a GP, particularly at a convenient time. As a result, some people are struggling to access the medical advice they need.

‘It is in the NHS’s interest to get primary healthcare for younger adults right and ensure services fit around busy working lives. A failure to meet their needs piles more pressure on budgets.’

The charity found young people often prefer to use walk-in centres but noted that nearly a quarter of these 24-hour services had closed since 2010.
