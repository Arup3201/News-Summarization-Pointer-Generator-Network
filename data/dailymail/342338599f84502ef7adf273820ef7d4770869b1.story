A British woman who was raped at knifepoint and left for dead said she ‘couldn’t be happier’ after her attacker was jailed for 23 years yesterday.

Moroccan waiter Mohamed Fadel el Anssari stabbed Cheryl Maddison repeatedly in the neck, throat and back after carrying out the sex attack in Magaluf, Majorca, in May 2008.

Judges in Palma sentenced him to 11 years for rape and 12 years for attempted murder.

Brave: Cheryl Maddison was raped and left for dead in Majorca in 2008. Her attacker, Moroccan Mohamed Fadel el Anssari was yesterday jailed for 23 years

Justice: Cheryl Maddison, 25, and boyfriend Kaine MacDonald, 21, appeared happy at the end of the trial in Palma Mallorca

Miss Maddison, 25, who waived her 
right to anonymity, broke down in tears after being told the news at her
 home in Houghton-le-Spring, Country Durham. ‘I’m over the moon, I 
couldn’t be happier,’ she said. ‘I had convinced myself he was going to 
get off which was terrifying.

‘All I ever wanted was for him to go to prison for a very long time.’

She was attacked at around 4am on May
 30, 2008, as she returned home to her rented flat after work. She had 
only been on the island for six days.

Fadel, 31, hit her in the face, 
grabbed her hair and forced her into her apartment. He whispered to her 
that she should keep quiet otherwise he would kill her, according to the
 judges’ report.

Once he was inside the flat, Fadel 
forced his victim to carry out a sex act. He then pushed her to the 
bedroom and raped her on the bed.

‘Immediately afterwards, with the intention of ending her life, he choked her,’ the judges said.

Fadel then stabbed her in the chest. 
When she came round he forced her to stand with her back to him before 
pushing his knife slowly into her neck.

Miss Maddison pretended to be dead until Fadel fled, before crawling out into the street.

She spent two weeks in hospital, with
 doctors saying she was lucky to have survived. The judges’ ruling was 
made public in a 52-page document released yesterday.

Miss Maddison updated her Facebook 
page to say: ‘I hope the b*****d rots!!!!!!!!’ When friends wrote of 
their support for her, she replied: ‘Thank you every1... I’m absolutely 
buzzing! Bouncing off the walls x’ Francisca Ramis, one of the three 
judges who convicted him, said Miss Maddison had been raped in a 
‘terrifying context of violence and intimidation’.

Police in Majorca launched a huge 
manhunt after the attack, but failed to find her attacker. Fadel was 
finally arrested in July 2011 after DNA on a cigarette found nearby 
matched that at the scene of the crime.

The court trying him last month heard
 that after his arrest he had confessed to raping and stabbing Cheryl 
and had admitted an attack on a second woman.

State prosecutor Jaime Guasp said police believed Fadel was responsible for a number of violent sex attacks.
