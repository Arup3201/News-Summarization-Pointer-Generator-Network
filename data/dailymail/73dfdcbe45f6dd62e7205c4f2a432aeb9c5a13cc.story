Almost 36,000 bottles of prescription eye drops have been recalled after they were found to contain printer ink

A product recall of eye drops has been issued after nearly 36,000 bottles were found to contain printer ink.

Bausch and Lomb, manufacturers of the prescription eye drops, has sent letters to doctors and chemists ordering the return of 35,800.

The company, one of the biggest eye-care firms in the world, has asked for the 1,780 batches - which contain 20 bottles in each - to be returned to their New York base after a manufacturing blunder.

In a letter to hospitals and pharmacies, Irene Fazakerley, of the Scottish Government's health department, said: 'Bausch and Lomb is recalling the batch because black particles have been identified in some packs.

'Initial investigations suggest that the contaminant is printing ink, in which case we understand that the risk of toxicity is low.

'No other batches of this or any other product are affected.

'Healthcare Professionals are asked to quarantine remaining stock and contact the wholesaler from which it was obtained to arrange uplift and replacement.'

A spokesman from the drug watchdog, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said: 'These eye drops are only used in hospitals and administered by medical professionals.

'We don't anticipate that people will have them at home.'

Bausch and Lomb, creator of the 
iconic Ray-Ban sunglasses, claimed that no one had been harmed by the 
botched lots of eye anaesthetic.

A
spokeswoman said: 'Bausch and Lomb is conducting a voluntary recall of a
single lot of proxymetacaine 0.5% Minims Eye Drops Solution.

'We chose to initiate this recall after confirming a report of the presence of foreign particles in a product from this single lot.

'No adverse events have been reported which have been attributed to the defective product in this single lot. No other lots have been affected.

'No other products in the Minims range or other Bausch and Lomb products are affected by this action.

'We are working closely with the MHRA to provide updated information regarding this recall action.'

An MHRA spokesperson added: There is no evidence that any patients are experiencing any problems from these eye drops and testing has shown that there is a low risk of any patients having any adverse reactions.

'This affected batch is not being used and we have alerted doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals about this issue.

'These eye drops are used as a local anaesthetic for eye procedures in hospital and are only used under the supervision of a qualified healthcare professional.

'People who are worried or who have concerns can speak to their doctor.'
