A year ago when Jonathan Antoine & Charlotte Jaconelli were heading for the finals of Britain’s Got Talent, the worst they expected to be thrown at them were barbs from Simon Cowell. 

His initial reaction, on seeing them, was that things could not get any worse. He then suggested Jonathan should dump Charlotte and go solo.

At this year’s final, Charlotte, seated without Jonathan, saw the egg-hurling incident during classical singers Richard and Adam’s performance, but thought it was all part of the act and viola player Natalie Holt was throwing flower petals at the judges.

Hitting the high notes: The classical duo were one of the show's underdog stories that captured the nation's imagination

‘I thought, “Oh, this is different. Our act could have done with something like this last year.” Then I realised it was egg on Simon’s jacket.

‘I saw Richard and Adam afterwards. They were quite upset about it. They felt people would watch it to see the egg girl rather than watch them, but they were happy to have got as far as they did in BGT.’ 

‘Thankfully it was only eggs,’ adds Jonathan. ‘If the situation was more serious and they had a gun or something else that could do harm and I was there, I am a large guy, I would literally have fallen on them and they’d be out of commission.’

For Jonathan and Charlotte, their own experience of the show has been life changing, but for 18-year-old baritone Jonathan in particular, who had severe depression during his childhood, it may have helped to save his life.

At their first audition in April 2012 they sang Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion’s duet The Prayer. 

Charlotte says: ‘The difference between walking on stage with his head down and walking off with his head high was like watching a film. Afterwards I thought, “Is this the same person? He’s so happy!"

‘I was probably bouncing around the room,’ he says. ‘I had not felt that elated for a very, very long time.’

What a difference a year makes: Jonathan lacked confidence when he appeared on the talent show last year. He had suffered from depression

Upstaged: Natalie Holt took centre stage on this year's final when she threw eggs at judge Simon Cowell

‘That’s when we realised, hang on, it was a good thing we applied,’ says Charlotte. ‘This will be good for us.’

Jonathan says: ‘A year ago I had no direction in life and now it’s insane the change that has happened.

'I have grown out of my teenage angst. I am the same person but I feel different . . . like Doctor Who, I have regenerated.’

Jonathan
weighed 20st when he appeared on BGT, but he says now: ‘I am on Weight 
Watchers and I have lost about 40lb, it is all on track and I’m really 
happy.

'My depression came 
from dealing with life. I feel I am better equipped for that now after 
the adventures we’ve been through and all the stuff that’s happened. 

‘When
I look back I understand why I felt that way. When you are in that 
mind-set it feels impossible to get out, you are upset about everything 
all the time, nothing seems bright or good.

'Being able to look back at that is something I thought I’d never be able to do and I am just so glad I can.

‘No one thing triggered it, but it was pretty much about school — I never enjoyed it.

‘Stress
and how I deal with it has been a big part of my life. That’s why I 
left school. I wasn’t sure I could handle the stress of this, either, 
but it has turned out for the best.

‘I no longer see a psychiatrist and I feel stable and able to cope — which is crazy considering where I was a year ago.

Second place: Jonathan and Charlotte lost out on the top prize, but went on to sign with Simon Cowell's record label

Chart success: The pair's first album reached no. 5 in the charts. They are going on their first tour and will be releasing a second album in October

'I am still on Prozac, but my dosage has gone down considerably. The irony is that being in the spotlight has helped.’

Though she plays it down, Charlotte is his guardian angel. You could see it in their first appearance where she rested a comforting hand on his shoulder, and sang his part when he joined in too early.

‘Watching somebody come from such a low place to where he is now made me think I’ve really had it easy,’ she says. ‘He’s made me appreciate things much more.’

Says Jonathan: ‘Charlotte has taught me to take no nonsense — she most certainly does not. 

‘In the business we are in you could so easily get messed up and you just have to have the strength of will to stand your ground.’

Turning to Jonathan, Charlotte adds: ‘Before going on the show I was probably one of the most unemotional people you could ever meet. I think you have only ever seen me cry twice.

‘I’m not cold-hearted, I just couldn’t express emotion except through my music, but the past year has made me more vulnerable and more able to be emotional in front of people.’

Charlotte faced a crisis of confidence at the start when Cowell suggested Jonathan dump her because she would hold him back. Jonathan told him: ‘We’ve come on here as a duo. We’re going to stay as a duo.’

She says: ‘What happened in the first audition knocked me back.

Competition: Last year's winner was Ashleigh Butler and her dog Pudsey, who beat Jonathan and Charlotte to the top prize of performing at the Royal Variety Show

‘Before we went on stage at the semi-finals, I couldn’t stop crying and couldn’t work out why. I realise now it was a panic attack.

Usually before we do a performance, Jonathan is very nervous and I’m there relaxed in a chair’. 

Jonathan and Charlotte met at school in Chigwell, Essex, when they were both 11. ‘We are like brother and sister,’  Charlotte says. 

‘I’ve had a few marriage proposals,’ adds Jonathan, not believing anyone could really be interested in him. 

‘I’ve stopped counting how many. It’s very weird. I know it’s in jest. I haven’t had a girlfriend for a very long time, two or three years.’

Both live at home with their parents.

Charlotte is funding a house extension and Jonathan is paying for his family’s garden to be landscaped. 

Meanwhile, they are excited about their second album Perhaps Love, which is due out in October. 

And next week they begin their first tour — backed by a 16-piece orchestra, all playing live — with, they hope, no egg throwers among them. 

Though if there is one, they’d better steer clear of Jonathan.
