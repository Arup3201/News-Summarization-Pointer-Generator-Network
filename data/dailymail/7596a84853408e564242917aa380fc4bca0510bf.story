Perhaps Ibrox was simply saving itself for Monday’s annual general meeting.

At the close of another tumultuous week in the club’s recent, crazed history there was scarcely a supporters’ stir by way of a reaction as they watched another low-grade home victory.

There was no show of support for Ally McCoist, in spite of their manager going through another week of emotional torment in which he moved closer to breaking ties with his club and learned of ex-colleague Mark Hateley working behind his back.

There was barely a ripple of a retort to the boardroom that has been undermining their Rangers hero.

And there, of course, was very little to shout about as a strike from Fraser Aird and a Simon Mensing own goal contributed to a routine Championship success.

Sadly, it is apathy and acceptance that has greeted the realisation that McCoist’s time is ticking down at Rangers. Even anger seems thin on the ground where once match days could be an ideal avenue for protest.

A quiet acquiescence now says that McCoist won’t be the man to lead the team much further and the stance from the fans as to who they really want removed from positions of power at Ibrox came only from a vocal pocket at the foot of the Broomloan Road Stand.

They warmed up the first-half action with some anti-boardroom chants, specifically aimed at Sandy and James Easdale. And ‘You greedy b*******, get out of our club’ came the cry in a muted flurry of fury towards the directors’ box.

It was claimed that 28,053 were present yet chairman David Somers, as he did a fortnight ago, may be required to offer an adjusted total to accurately reflect the dwindling nature of the Ibrox audience.

McCoist, who continued to invite his players to raise their game against the unobtrusive backdrop by being a visible presence in his technical area throughout, suggested it could be a while before the disaffected fans flock back to the stadium in old numbers after taking too many slaps in the face from Rangers regimes.

McCoist said: ‘I am not sure attendances are a worry. Obviously, when we are playing at home, I would far rather the team was being supported by 50,000 rather than 15,000, 20,000 or 25,000. That goes without saying.

‘However, I do understand, 100 per cent, the vast majority of fans’ feelings over the last three years. I have felt unbelievably sorry for the fans. I think the club will get the fans back. But in the short term? I don’t know about that.’

Rangers boss Ally McCoist looked in high spirits despite recent difficulties at Ibrox

On what may turn out to be his Ibrox dugout farewell, McCoist went for a selection first against a Livingston side that parted with their manager John McGlynn last week. Nicky Clark and Kenny Miller were paired in attack as Jon Daly joined Kris Boyd on the bench.

The players, perhaps still shellshocked by the leaking of McCoist’s resignation news, were dreadfully slow starters in their last outing at Queen of the South. And they survived an early scare here before

seizing a 10th-minute advantage. For Mark Burchill’s caretaker reign would have started in spectacular fashion were it not for the excellence of Steve Simonsen.

The keeper produced a brilliant lefthanded block, smartly getting down to push away Danny Mullen’s drive.

Rangers were far from fluent in their efforts to build up a lead on the Championship’s bottom club and had to settle for one goal before the break.

From a Stevie Smith corner not adequately cleared, the ball dropped to the right foot of Aird and he drilled a fine finish back across goal and into the bottom right-hand corner of Darren Jamieson’s net.

Ian Black ruffled the side netting but Livingston’s defence could hardly have been described as under siege.

It took a superb overhead kick from Lewis Macleod to split the sides in the season’s earlier meeting but, with the midfield ace out injured, there was no hint of such quality invention here. With the home side mustering their own motivation without a well of support from the stands, Livingston dug in to stay in the contest.

Had Jordan White fared better with a header from eight yards, the focus of Ibrox upset would have swivel led back on to the performance of McCoist’s players.

He was locked in conversation with assistant Kenny McDowall for long spells of the second half in a bid to figure out a lock-breaking move.

Those chats couldn’t help Nicky Law conjure a second goal to warm the blood of the loyal souls suffering at the struggles of their side.

The midfielder was under pressure from Callum Fordyce but should have produced better than a failure to hit the target from 12 yards after Aird’s cutback.

All those dugout discussions did add up to a call for flair and a finisher from the bench, so McCoist introduced David Templeton and Kris Boyd with 17 minutes left.

However, it was a malfunction rather than magic that held the key to breaking down Livingston for a second time.

Aird’s delivery from the right was a teaser but it came down to a communication disconnect between Mensing and his keeper aiding Rangers to confirm victory. The visiting skipper intervened as Jamieson flew out to collect and nodded the ball into an empty net.

Substitute Dean Shiels was the unlikely last line of defence to stop Keaghan Jacobs dragging the visitors back into the game and Rangers’ relief was soon complete. Not that it was obvious to feel on a numb afternoon in Govan.

Half-time advertising had boasted of a second-half season tickets being available for £125.

It’s going to take more than a few discount labels on that figure — preferably without Sports Direct branding — to tempt the bravest Rangers souls into taking up that offer.
