The challenge consisted of a 1.9km swim, a 90km bike ride and a 21.1km run.

Button shared pictures of the challenge via his Twitter account on Tuesday morning which included a snap of himself standing on the podium - something the Formula 1 star is certainly used to.

One picture showed other participants clearly exhausted from the challenge flat out on a grassy area as Button joked: 'This is how crazy the party was post race!'
