Miranda Kerr's mother, father, brother and grandmother have begged the supermodel to get in touch, revealing that they have not seen her or her son Flynn for 'over a year'.

Making an extraordinary public plea for the two to return home to Australia, they revealed that a rift had seen the supermodel cut off contact.

In a docudrama titled 
Family Confidential, which will air on Australian Television network ABC
 next Tuesday, Miranda's 
father John even tells how his daughter's husband 
Orlando was the one to  confirm the couple's separation.

'I remember him saying "we're always going to be family" and that's how we'll treat Orlando, Miranda and Flynn. We're all family,' he says of the phone call, in which the actor broke the news of the end of the three-year union.

Miranda's mother Therese stepped down as general manager and chief executive 
officer of her skincare line Kora Organics last February, sparking 
rumours of a rift between the pair.

John says that he now wished his daughter had married a 'nobody', someone who was completely out of the limelight.

So close: Miranda and her mother Therese used to be like 'best friends' and speak every single day, but it appears that things have changed

'After what I know now I would rather she did just marry a nobody because you really can't get that family time by yourself,' he says.

'I just hope Flynn grows up and he wants to be with his nan and pop.'

Miranda's grandmother Ann, who also appears in the documentary, has been left particularly devastated that she has not seen her precious great-grandson, saying: 'I miss the baby and I think he's missing out on family, that closeness that we have always had.

'It's very nice where they are but nothing like Australia, nothing, and I think hopefully Flynn might end up here. We just keep our fingers crossed.'

Miranda and her grandmother previously shared a special bond, with Ann often appearing in interviews and on modelling shoots alongside the model in the past.

Meanwhile, Miranda's mother Therese, who says she used to speak to her daughter every single day, is teary as she explains of how she had to eventually 'let go' of her daughter.

'What I have had to do is let go,' she explains, 'and allow her to be assertive and lead her own life and I guess for any mum that's a little bit challenging sometimes to do that.'

Therese says she now sends texts to Miranda to remind her that she's always there for her, but as she is filmed doing so during the documentary, they are not always immediately reciprocated.

'We have been best friends for most of our life. We used to talk just about every day.

'I send her messages, just little texts to say "I love you honey, let your little light shine, my arms are wrapped around you."'

Before Miranda moved to New York at the age of 25, her parents say they told the then budding supermodel 'the day you think you're better than anyone else is the day you don't model under our guidance'.

Therese says these days her daughter's life is completely different, but it is important as her mother says to stand 'true'.

'Miranda's life is so different now (and) she's surrounded by yes people all the time. It's so important for me to be real, to be true, to be who she needs me to be,' she says.

Since parting ways with Miranda's Kora Organics skincare line, Therese has created her own called Divine by Therese Kerr, and says that while she realises her daughter's fame has helped get the 'message out', it has perhaps come at a cost to her family.

'You have to be in the media to be able to get your message out, but then our little Flynny doesn't know what it's like to walk outside without paparazzi,' she says.

Meanwhile, the former Victoria's Secret Angel's father says that while he's proud of his daughter for being a strong independent 30-year-old, he also wishes that she was just a 'normal, everyday girl'.

'There were so many people who said "oh Miranda she used to be this nice little girl who we could get to do anything", whereas now she's like 'you know what, I'm not doing that anymore,' he says.

MailOnline have reached out to Miranda's representatives in regards to the documentary, but have yet to hear a response.
