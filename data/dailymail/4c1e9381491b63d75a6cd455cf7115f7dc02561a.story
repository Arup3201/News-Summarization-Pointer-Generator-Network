They are probably the most hated reality couple in the history of Celebrity Big Brother but Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag have revealed they faked their way to the final by playing the pantomime villains.

Speidi stole the show with their villainous behaviour and venomous ways but The Hills' stars said they were simply doing their job.

Spencer, 29, said: 'They brought us in to be Speidi and stir it all up. I feel like a cartoon character. My talent for some odd reason, is being an a**hole.'

It was just a job for them: Heidi and Spencer kissed for the cameras as they found out they would be leaving ahead of Rylan

But all Spencer and Heidi 
efforts fell at the last hurdle when they narrowly missed out on winning
 the Celebrity Big Brother trophy on Friday night, coming second to 
eventual winner Rylan Clark.

Speidi first revealed their fake' nature at an emotional last supper for the housemates, but Spencer's speech didn't win over the other celebrities, many of whom were simply shocked at their outburst.

With Spencer, who said he gave up college to become a reality star. crying into his Chablis, other housemates thought the pair were simply stirring up emotions for votes.

Break down: Spencer Pratt gets emotional on the last night in the Celebrity Big Brother house as he tells his housemates he felt he had to play 'the bad guy'

US star Spencer broke down in tears as he claimed he was putting on a front as 'the bad guy' and admitted he was intentionally causing upset in the house so he could 'pay the bills'.

He told the rest of the contestants as he continued crying: 'I thought that (Big Brother) would be fun, I could go 
and be the villain I've always been - it's my opportunity 
to make conflict and make drama.

'In my heart I do care about everyone. I told Big Brother you gave me the wrong
 cast - it's been very difficult for me to be awful but you know, I just 
got to be the bad guy - just got to be the baddie and I had to step up and
 pay my bills.

So now he's being nice: The Hills star made his speech during his last dinner with the his housemates

'I can't come all the way from America and not be the bad guy cos that's not what they cast me for.'

He then added while himself and Heidi continued crying: 'It's been hard to be the bad guy of this season, it's usually a lot easier.'

While Heidi added: 'This was just a job for us. We never did this for "the experience"'

On top: Rylan was crowned the 2013 winner and came out to the crowds looking ecstatic to cheers

Enjoying the reaction: Spencer happily welcomed the boos from the crowd and remained defiant when chatting to presenter Brian Dowling

Crocodile tears? His speech led some housemates to speculate he was putting on an act as a last ditch attempt to win votes from viewers

Drama: Spencer gave it his all as he spoke of his time in the house, insisting he had a place in his heart for them all... after causing controversy throughout

Cheers: Heidi insisted she's never seen Spencer cry before after he sat back down again

The speech caused the housemates to also start crying, and his wife Heidi was particularly taken aback as she admitted: 'I've never seen my husband cry before'.

Giving her own speech, finally being kinder to her fellow contestants compared to the rest of the series, Heidi Montag said: 'I didn't know I could complete this - the worse experience and the best. I do have a place for all of you in my heart. I'm appreciative of my husband. I'm a bigger, stronger better person.'

But while they seemed to move the housemates inside, with them all putting on their 'sympathy faces', as soon as the drama was over it seems they weren't all fooled by his words.

Taking a walk in the garden, Razor questioned Rylan: 'Were they for votes do you reckon?'

To which the singer replied after a pause: 'What the night before the final? You just have to break down. I can't believe anything that comes out of their mouths.'

And even Claire Richards admitted when speaking to Brian Dowling after being voted out in fourth place: 'I had my sympathy face on but I did think "that's a load of c**p."'

So near but so far: Ryan, Claire and Razor came third, fourth and fifth respectively throughout the evening

'Spiteful': Claire, among with the rest of the housemates, admitted they weren't sure if the tears were real but Spencer insisted they were because he's not 'that good an actor'

During Ryan's eviction interview, after coming third, he added: 'If they're here to be baddies they've done a good job haven't they?'

But as soon as Speidi eventually left the house in second place, Spencer insisted that 'yeah the tears were real'.

He added to presenter Brian Dowling: 'We went in to try and be the most entertaining we could be. I didn't come here to meet any new friends... we came here to be champion... If we didn't get this reaction we didn't do our jobs properly.'

It was also prominent that there was only one British star in the final three - Rylan was joined by one Auatralian, Ryan Maloney who came third, and two Americans - Spencer and Heidi, who were voted second by the public at home.
