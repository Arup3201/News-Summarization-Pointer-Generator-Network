High flier: Victoria Sadler took up burlesque dancing to counterbalance her £150,000 city job

After a decade in a high-flying job in the City, Victoria Sadler thought she had seen and heard it all: traders who used their expense accounts to take clients to strip clubs; colleagues openly mingling with prostitutes and vile sexist language bandied about on a daily basis.

There was the 40-year-old trader who had a heart attack and died at his desk.

And another who threw a tantrum in the office – sweating profusely and sniffing constantly then screaming ‘you bitch’ at her before he smashed her phone against the wall.

He had not even bothered to wipe the tell-tale smudge of white powder from his nose.

So when the disenchanted internal auditor took up burlesque dancing – swapping austere daytime suits for pink sequins, spangles and feathers in the evening – she never suspected it would end her £150,000-a-year career.

Now, instead of auditing the professional behaviour of traders, Victoria has adapted their characteristics to feature in her routines.

In one dance she begins dressed as Michael Douglas’s unscrupulous Wall Street trader Gordon Gekko and morphs into Madonna’s Material Girl in a basque covered in bank notes.

She works under the name Victoria L’Etoile and performs for an audience dominated by men – but one over which she says she has total control.

‘When I took up burlesque in 2003 I was working at Merrill Lynch,’ says Victoria, 36. ‘I liked it because it countered the testosterone-fuelled environment of my working life.

‘Even though I was the pudgy, pasty-faced girl in the corner of the burlesque class I appeared to have a talent for it. I did keep it secret from the bank. Compared to the behaviour of those around me on the trading floor, it seemed a harmless hobby.’

But in 2008, when she was working for another major bank, a colleague sent an email to her employers containing a video clip of her performing at Soho cabaret bar Madame JoJo’s.

Victoria had just been promoted but was accused of bringing the firm into disrepute – a charge which carried the threat of instant dismissal.

‘I was in shock,’ Victoria recalls. ‘I cried, broke down and rang my lawyer. The sheer hypocrisy of it was just astonishing. The banks quietly condone the poor behaviour of male traders but I was being faced with the sack.’

It was September 2008, the time of the financial crisis. ‘You would have thought the banks had more to worry about,’ she says. But Victoria was subjected to a painful and painstaking eight-month-long investigation.

The final 200-page report from the bank’s human resources team, who had studied the video of her dancing, included comments that she stroked her leg during her act, and that her breasts ‘wobbled’ when she danced.

‘They pulled everything out of context,’ Victoria says. ‘They made it seem smutty.’ In September the following year she finally left in disgust, forced out by the ‘sexist’ bosses who refused to discipline her colleagues.

Today she is more interested in her performances and has transformed her act to bring comedy – and her experiences of banking – into her act.

‘My audiences are a mixed crowd of men and women – the women “get it” when there’s satire and comedy, which after all is in line with the origins of cabaret. It’s very gratifying.’

Victoria is also releasing an explosive new book, Banking On Burlesque, in which she lifts the lid on what really takes place on the trading floors of the City’s biggest banks.

She claims that at Merrill Lynch male colleagues openly boasted they were going to clubs to ‘get some slags’, and that one of her managers – a  married man with children – invited her into his office and wanted her to mark him out of ten for his naked body.

There were also sexist insults on the trading floor. ‘The big screens on the trading floor were supposed to show news clips but they were showing women’s aerobics, on a loop,’ she said.

Far more seriously she was appalled to discover fraudulent traders creating fake trades to boost apparent profits to secure their jobs and their bonuses.

‘I audited one trader who later was investigated by the bank. The sum involved was around £300 million,’ she said. ‘I was then told that was the fifth trader who had been investigated for suspected fraud that year.’

She claims drug taking was rife. ‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I witnessed their behaviour,’ she says. ‘They weren’t taking drugs in a party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.’

The eldest daughter of an architect father and mother who is a nurse, Surrey-born Victoria opted for a career in the City in 2000 after gaining a politics degree from Manchester University.

‘I never saw the traders take drugs, but I
witnessed their behaviour. They weren’t taking drugs in a 
party way, it was to survive and cope with the stress.'

‘It was one of the few jobs that paid enough to allow me to move out of home and buy a flat on my starting salary,’ she concedes bluntly. ‘I do think I was perhaps naive.’

But by 2002, when she was working as an internal auditor for Merrill Lynch, she was beginning to dislike the sexism and policies she saw on the trading floor.

‘I am a bolshie and brusque personality so I assimilated with the culture quite easily,’ she said. ‘But then there was a big sex discrimination case brought by Stephanie Villalba who had been the head of the private wealth division. She was the only female head of a department. Out of the blue she resigned and sued Merrill Lynch.

‘It was at that point that the scales began to fall from my eyes. Because I worked in internal audit I was responsible for investigating traders. I realised that every trader I saw had been white, and male.’

Around the same time Victoria was up for a pay review and had been discussing with a male colleague, who did the same job and got the same promotion, what their salaries and bonuses were likely to be.

When he came out of the manager’s office he triumphantly revealed the figures, expecting she would get the same result. But when I went in the figures were different,’ she said. ‘He had got £60,000 and a bonus and I had £57,000. We had the same performance scores and reputation.

‘When I told the boss I knew about this he was furious and said we shouldn’t have been discussing it. They later offered to pay me more – even more than my colleague – as long as I kept quiet about it.

‘I thought, “Wow this sexist stuff does really exist.” It was the first clue I had that I would have to fight to be treated equally.

‘Merrill Lynch was like a boys’ club where everyone was trying to do the Gordon Gekko thing.’

'The pressure on the traders was 
immense. They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to 
get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic.'

But if Merrill Lynch was a boys’ club, Victoria says the other bank was ‘a grim treadmill’. ‘The pressure on the traders was immense,’ she said. ‘They looked like sick dogs who didn’t know how to get out. They were cannon fodder and their behaviour was erratic.

‘Later, when I had my own discussions with my bank’s human resources department over my burlesque show, I talked about what I had seen in the industry.

‘I was told that there was no evidence that traders went to strip shows and no evidence that they took drugs. I was staggered.’

But had Victoria never considered her double-life as a performer might create problems? ‘No,’ she says. ‘But when I told my mother I had taken up burlesque she was appalled, and she gave me a warning:  “Watch who you tell.”

‘It wasn’t that she thought it was shameful, but I should beware of other people’s prejudices.’

After being forced out of the bank, Victoria got an 18-month contract with Goldman Sachs, where she felt that despite the devastation of the credit crisis ‘nothing much had changed’.

Yet she insists, despite conceding she faces an uncertain future as  a writer and a dancer, that she has no regrets.

‘I enjoyed working in banking for a time,’ Victoria said. ‘But I’m much happier doing burlesque now and working on books.

‘In banking I felt I was losing my identity as a woman. I don’t want to go back to that hell. It was a world of abuse, sexism, ruthlessness – I felt like I was wasting my life.

‘Now burlesque has freed me from that. And the women in this world are bold and assertive – unlike the few pretty little female assistants you meet on the trading floors.

‘I’m 5ft 8in and a size 14 but burlesque is not about how you look. And my role models here are women who don’t need to take any crap.’
