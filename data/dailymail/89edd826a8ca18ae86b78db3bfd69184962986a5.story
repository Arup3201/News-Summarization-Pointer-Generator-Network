A hospital has become the first in Britain to trial a futuristic way of getting medications to patients quickly.

Wexham Park Hospital, in Slough, is using Futurama-style tubes to deliver prescriptions.

The series of pneumatic tubes shoot prescription medications to wards and departments all over the hospital.

Heatherwood and Wexham Park Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has also become the first in the country to automate their drug dispensary, by using two robots.

The Â£600,000 automated drug robots, nicknamed Tom and Jerry, work automatically to sort through the mounds of different prescriptions before placing each medication in a tube, to be sent to the doctor in charge.

The Dutch-made robots slash the waiting time for patients to receive their drugs by more than half.

Chief Pharmacist Dennis Lauder said: 'Our whole ethos in pharmacy is patient safety.

'The number of dispensing errors is low at the Trust and is line with the national average.

'Nevertheless, we consider any error to be serious and the robots will certainly help to eliminate them.

The hospital says the new system has more than halved the time it takes patients to receive their medication

'We feel it's important to invest in and continuously improve our efficiency so that we can continue to provide a high quality and safe service.'

The robots pick the correct medicines by automatically scanning the barcodes on the packaging, with zero margin for error.

A spokesperson for the Trust said: 'It really is like Futurama.

'The robots do the work, sort out the drugs and then they shoot along these tubes to where they need to go.

The hospital says the new system will prevent errors being made in the distribution of medicines

'It is a revolutionary new system and nobody else has them yet.

'We can see it being the future of pharmacology in the NHS, especially for large hospitals like ours.'

Within minutes, prescriptions are sorted and either handed out then and there or sent through the more than 200-metres of air tubes to the pharmacy department for staff to distribute.

Mr Lauder added the robots can sift through more than 900 items an hour, and will reduce waiting times for medication from two hours to less than one, freeing up pharmacy staff to spend more time with patients on wards.
