Even among all the dastardly deeds King Richard III might have committed, there is one crime of which he never stood accused – he never harmed a goldfish.

But five centuries on from the much-maligned monarch’s reign, he has become embroiled in a row he could never have foreseen.

The murder of the Duke of Clarence in a modern-day interpretation of Shakespeare’s play has incurred the wrath of animal rights champions – after it was alleged a goldfish was injured during the performance.

A woman who bought a front-row seat to watch Martin Freeman, star of the BBC’s Sherlock, play Richard at the Trafalgar Studios theatre in London, claimed to have seen a fish squished during a scene in which Clarence’s life is despatched in a tank of water.

She reported the production to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals group (Peta), claiming the goldfish was ‘ground up with the gravel and pushed up against the sides of the tank’ as the actor ‘thrashed around wildly’.

Peta contacted director Jamie Lloyd to complain the life of the goldfish was being placed in peril of injury or death. 

Campaign co-ordinator Kirsty Henderson asked him to stop using live fish for entertainment in what she described as an unsuitable environment.

In a series of tweets, Mr Lloyd responded by insisting: ‘As a strict vegan, the safety & welfare of the goldfish in Richard III has been my top priority. They are growing & flourishing.’

He added: ‘No goldfish has been harmed or killed in Richard III. We’ve followed very strict guidelines to ensure their well-being & happiness.’

The modern take on Shakespeare's historical Richard III has been playing on the West End since July 1

Eight goldfish are employed in rotated pairs to depict Clarence being murdered in the tank, which then appears to fill with blood. Clarence has earlier described a ‘drowning’ dream in which he sees fish gnawing at the bodies of shipwrecked men.

In the original Shakespeare play, Clarence is stabbed and drowned in a butt of malmsey wine. History does not record if goldfish featured in the murder, but none is mentioned by the Bard. Peta says in its letter to Mr Lloyd that experts report fish to be ‘intelligent, sensitive animals who feel pain just like humans do’. They also possessed long-term memories and complex social structures.

It concluded: ‘Taking them out of the production altogether is the only way to ensure their welfare and would in no way affect the success of the show itself.’

Yesterday Mr Lloyd agreed to withdraw the fish from the production, which opened on July 1 and is scheduled to run until September 27.

He added in a statement that the goldfish were supplied by a reputable dealer and cared for under RSPCA-approved conditions to ensure no distress was caused to them.

If only the same could have been said for the Duke of Clarence. 

George Plantagenet, the 1st Duke of Clarence was Richard the III's brother and is a key character in William Shakespeare's play.

In original versions, the play opens with Clarence being framed for treason before he is arrested and taken to the Tower.

In one scene, Clarence recounts a nightmare of being pushed into the ocean and drowning - later on in the play he is attacked by assassins sent by Gloucester, the man who framed him, and is stabbed and drowned in a butt of wine.

In the version - set in 1970s Britain and starring Martin Freeman - the butt of wine was ditched for an office fish tank in a modern twist on the gruesome murder.
