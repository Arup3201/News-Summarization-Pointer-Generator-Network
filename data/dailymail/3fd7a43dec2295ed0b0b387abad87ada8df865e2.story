Barcelona defender Pique and pop star partner Shakira are not like many couples.

The pair, who are expecting their second child, want to use their own personal joy to help poverty-stricken people around the world.

The couple are expanding their original World Baby Shower initiative to aid Unicef after they came up with the concept after the birth of their son Milan in 2013.

One picture shows them with their smiling son Milan, while another has Barcelona player Pique is seen standing behind her, beaming with pride as he wraps his arms around her blossoming body. 

Explaining the thinking behind the campaign, 37-year-old singer Shakira explains: 'Now that we are soon welcoming our second child we want to help other children around the world and also contribute to a long-lasting solution for getting children living in extreme poverty the supplies they need to survive.

The couple, pictured above with Milan in October, want to help the world's poorest mothers and children with the drive, which gets fans to donate by buying 'inspired gifts' online

The pair are hoping to provide midwifery kits with medical equipment for safe delivery of 50 babies, measles and polio vaccines, blankets, and baby scales through the campaign

'We also want other parents to feel compelled to do the same. 

'With the explosion of social media, celebrities aren't the only ones who have platforms that can reach mass audiences, and we want this movement to keep going long after our baby shower has ended, so we want to invite them to host their own baby showers with Unicef as well.'

Shakira urges her fans to head to Facebook to buy 'inspired gifts', which will be transformed into donations for the cause. 

These include midwifery kits with medical equipment for safe delivery of 50 babies, measles and polio vaccines, blankets, and baby scales.

The celebrity couple’s first virtual World Baby Shower to benefit Unicef’s mission for children was held from January to February 2013 and as a result, over 80,000 children were vaccinated against polio while nearly four tonnes of therapeutic food helped children suffering from malnutrition.
