Even the most devoted Lego fans could struggle to wrap their brains around some of these tricky puzzles.

The famous Danish toy firm has released a set of posters featuring a range of teasing 'riddles' to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the Lego blocks.

The puzzles - made with different size and colour bricks - are minimalist, and require a varying degree of thought to unravel.

Among the answers are Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the Tortoise and the Hare, Reservoir Dogs, and Stairway to Heaven.

The name Lego is an abbreviation of the two Danish words 'leg godt,' which means 'play well.'

Violent: The film these bricks represent is definitely not for the faint hearted. The bricks' colours are a big clue

The Lego Group was founded in 1932 by Ole Kirk Kristiansen, and is now owned by one of his grandchildren.

The first Lego 'automatic binding brick' was launched in its present form in 1958. A spokesman for the firm said the riddles were designed to 'honour' the brick.

Lego operates 46 stores worldwide, including seven in Britain and 34 in the US. This includes ones at the Disneyland and Walt Disney World Resorts as well as in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.

A Lego store was also opened in Lima, Peru in November 2010.
