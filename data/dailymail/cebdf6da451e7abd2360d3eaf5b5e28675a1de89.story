A trainee flight attendant on board doomed AirAsia flight QZ8501 left a touching love letter from the sky for her boyfriend in one of her last Instagram posts.

‘I love you from 38,000 ft,’ 22-year-old Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi wrote on a napkin to her partner Divo just two weeks ago.

Ms Khairunisa has been tentatively identified as one of the seven bodies so far retrieved from the Java Sea after the aircraft crashed on Sunday, 42 minutes after taking off from Surabaya in Indonesia with 162 people on board.

'I love you from 38,000 ft': AirAsia stewardess Khairunisa Haidar Fauzi wrote on a napkin to her partner Divo two weeks ago

The 22-year-old has been tentatively named as one of the bodies retrieved from the Java Sea

Along with photos of her travels, family and friends, Ms Khairunisa often shared messages to her boyfriend including his and her name written in sand on Instagram.

The body of the former law student, who was following her dreams of becoming a stewardess after joining AirAsia last year, was  identified because her name tag was reportedly still attached to her uniform.

Authorities have confirmed the bodies of four males and three females – including a flight attendant – have been discovered in the search.

Her father, Haidar Fauzi, told the Sydney Morning Herald that he heard his daughter had been found but it has not been officially confirmed.

‘We only borrowed our daughter from God and now he has taken her back,’ Mr Haidar told the SMH.

Her family have been waiting at Juanda Airport near Surabaya in East Java province, where a crisis centre has been providing information to anxious relatives since the plane vanished from radars after departing the airport for Singapore.

‘This is what we expected, and the sooner the body is returned, the sooner we can have her back,’ Mr Haidar said.

Known to her friends as Nisa, her father said she would have put the lives of her passengers before her own.

Ms Khairunisa's brother, M. Ikhsan Nul Kamil, told Indonesian news portal Detik.com: ‘If they are saying they have found the body of one of the air stewardess, then we hope it is our little sister.’

He described her as a cheerful person and said: ‘She was a good girl, always liked to help others. I always asked for her help when I need it.

‘But she was also 'manja' (spoiled) because she phoned home four times a day.’
