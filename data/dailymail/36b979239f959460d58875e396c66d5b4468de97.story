The Australian Commonwealth Games women's swim team uniform is a shock for all the wrong reasons - part of the country has been left off.

After the team's formal uniform was slammed as being 'ugly' when it was first revealed last month, the latest problem is the state of Tasmania has been completely left off maps of Australia that are pasted on the women's swim team's one-piece swimsuit.

The missing state has caused outrage in Tasmania, with many in the state still sensitive about a similar blunder 32 years ago, which saw the island state dropped from a map of Australia created by performers at the Brisbane Commonwealth Games in 1982.

The Speedo design has even sparked the ire of outspoken Palmer United Party senator Jacqui Lambie, reported News.com.au.

'I hope that it was an oversight and not deliberate. Tasmania also disappeared from Olympic medals and posters for Baz Luhrmann’s movie Australia, so it's very disappointing that the same oversight has happened a number of times, she said.

The senator has even suggested the state be compensated with $5 million for a tourism advertising campaign and money to lower the cost of sea travel to Tasmania.

With funding cuts to Tasmanian tourism since 2008, Ms Lambie said an apology with a payment from the government would not be enough to rectify the error, especially for the impacted tourism sector.

'Ordinary Tasmanians will be offended and feelings will be hurt. We're very proud of our state, however more than just feelings will be hurt,' she said.

During the games, seven Tasmanian athletes are representing their state.

In another shocker, Tie Me Kanagroo Down was not what Australian athletes expected to hear while heading to the flag bearer's ceremony in Glasgow.

There are reports a Scottish bus driver played the song by paedophile musician Rolf Harris' as he drove the Aussie athletes on Monday, reported News.com.au.

The track was stopped shortly after it started and was featured on an Aussie hits CD bought by the driver and was the third song after Land Down Under and I'd Love to Have a Beer With Duncan.

Cyclist Anna Meares was unveiled as Australia's flag bearer during the ceremony.

Another blunder for the Commonwealth Games was that two unidentified Australian athletes set to compete at the games could have missed their chance at taking gold after a blunder saw them entered in the wrong event.

The unaware pair have not been told of the error because it 'has nothing to do with the athletes' said Australian Commonwealth Games Association Chief (ACGA) executive Perry Crosswhite, who is refusing to confirm the athletes' identity or sport.

'One athlete was entered in the wrong event and the other was not entered for an additional event they should have been in,' he said.

He also said it was possible the athletes involved do not know the were caught up in the oversight.

The mix up saw 48 athletes from eight countries granted special dispensation by the Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF) so they can take part in their events, reported News.com.au.

Entry deadline was June 11 and a CFG statement stated the athletes' administrators were behind the bungle which meant the athletes were not entered could have resulted in them not competing in their events.

'It was never an issue. They were always going to be in. We just had to go through a process that didn’t come out until yesterday,' Crosswhite said.

'Absolutely there was a mistake. The ACGA made an entering mistake and we admitted it straight away and we made sure it was corrected.'
