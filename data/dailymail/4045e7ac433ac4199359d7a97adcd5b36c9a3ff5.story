Jack Wilshere has asked Arsene Wenger about the possibility of playing in a deeper midfield role for Arsenal.

Wilshere’s performances have improved rapidly since he was first deployed by England directly in front of the defence against Switzerland in September.

Wenger, however, prefers to use the 22-year-old in more advanced positions, where his vision and quick passes can create chances, and is reluctant to make a change.

‘I wouldn’t mind playing there for Arsenal,’ said Wilshere. ‘I’ve already spoken to the manager about it and he doesn’t see me playing that holding role just yet. That’s his decision. 

'At the moment Mikel Arteta is injured and Mathieu Flamini is playing that role. It’s down to him.

‘This is probably the best I’ve played for England and I’m enjoying it. I said after the first game against Switzerland that I’d only get better. It was my first game in that role. The main thing is the coaches are getting their points across.’

Wilshere was voted man of the match against Slovenia on Saturday and then produced a wonderful pass on Tuesday to create the opening goal for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in England’s 3-1 win in Scotland. 

It was his first England assist, although Wilshere claims Wayne Rooney is also at fault for this. 

He said: ‘If that’s true, I’ve got Wazza to blame because against Estonia he could’ve had six.’

Meanwhile, Wilshere’s Arsenal team-mate Lukas Podolski has been warned his international future may be in jeopardy if he doesn’t quit the club in January. 

The forward has hardly featured for the Gunners this season and Germany boss Joachim Low has said the 29-year-old’s place in his country’s squad will come under threat if he isn’t playing regularly.
