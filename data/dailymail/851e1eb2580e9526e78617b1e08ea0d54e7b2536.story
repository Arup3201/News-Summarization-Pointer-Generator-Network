Most games come with a safeguard that if you fall down a hole, get killed by a monster or fail to complete a level in time you can have another go.

But not in Upsilon Circuit. Once you die in this ‘part gameshow, part role-playing game’ you are never allowed to play it again - a feature the developers call 'perma-permadeath.'

Only eight ‘contestants’ are allowed to play at any one time and each player is then replaced by a member of an audience watching the whole action unfold.

Once chance: Upsilon Circuit is ‘in early development’ by New Hampshire-based developers Robot Loves Kitty. It calls the game ‘part gameshow, part action role-playing’ and only eight people can play at any one time. Once a player dies they can never play again, a feature the developers call 'perma-permadeath'

Upsilon Circuit is ‘in early development’ by Calvin Goble and Alix Stolzer from New Hampshire-based Robot Loves Kitty.

Players must solve puzzles and battle monsters to win rewards, but these rewards are then given to the audience.

Audience members choose how these rewards are subsequently used by the contestant to increase their skill level, for example.

‘When you are chosen to play, the world watches, and everyone has a hand in your journey, both friend and foe,’ said Robot Love Kitty.

Contestants explore the overworld and dungeons (pictured) in search of the Dream Tech Crystals. They fight monsters, avoid traps, and compete with the opposing team. When the contestant earns rewards they are given to an online audience. Audience members then choose how these rewards are used by the contestant 

In Upsilon Circuit, each contestant explores the overworld and generated dungeons in search of the Dream Tech Crystals. 

They fight monsters, avoid traps, and compete with the opposing team. 

When the contestant fights monsters or gets treasure, the [experience points] and other rewards go to an online audience.

Only eight ‘contestants’ can play at any one time and once they die they can't play again.

A player is then replaced by a member of an audience.

‘Upsilon Circuit is two games intertwined. The contestant's adventure, while the audience intervenes.

‘Each contestant explores the overworld and generated dungeons in search of the Dream Tech Crystals. They fight monsters, avoid traps, and compete with the opposing team.'

When the contestant fights monsters or gets treasure, the [experience points] and other rewards go to the audience.

‘Simply put, the audience is part dungeon master, part strategist, and part judge and jury,’ continued the developers. 

Replacement audience members are selected randomly, but the developers said they may introduce minigames in which the audience can unlock items.

This could potentially improve their chances of getting a turn.

Upsilon Circuit was demonstrated at last year's indie gaming event Pax East. 

Interested players can sign up to the game’s mailing list to be informed about when the show starts but the developers have not announced when this will be.
