Bank account holders in Cyprus could be subjected to a weekly limit on cash withdrawals, it emerged today.

Cypriot finance ministers have drafted a series of capital controls that also include export limits on euros, a ban on cashing cheques.

Fixed-term deposits may also have to be held until maturity.

Cash crisis: Cypriot finance ministers are considering weekly limits on withdrawals to curb a run on deposits

Earlier, the Central Bank governor said measures to avert a run on deposits after a painful EU rescue plan will be 'loose' but would apply to all banks on the island.

Panicos Demetriades said they would be 'temporary' but would not say how long they would last.

He said authorities were doing 'all they could' to ensure banks reopen on Thursday as announced late yesterday.

The two banks at the centre of the financial crisis - Bank of Cyprus and Cyprus Popular Bank - are currently limiting ATM withdrawals to 100 euros a day.

News of the limits on cash withdrawals, revealed by the BBC, came after the 
Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) announced British pensions would not be paid into Cypriot bank accounts for the 
foreseeable future and advised expats to open UK accounts.

Chancellor George Osborne also revealed the Treasury is working on a solution for the 13,000 UK customers of Cyprus Popular Bank, part of Laiki Bank, who could lose up to 40 per cent of their savings above the 100,000 euros (£85,000) cut-off limit.

A spokeswoman for the DWP said a 'watching brief' is in place on the situation but 
payments into Cypriot bank accounts will not resume when banks on the 
island reopen - currently planned for Thursday.

In a statement to MPs, Pensions Minister Steve Webb said the Government 
is advising people to either switch their payments to a British account 
they already have or to open a new one.

About 6,000 of the 18,133 British expats on Cyprus use a British bank account already and so are not affected by the freeze.

Mr Webb said: 'We are advising customers to change the bank account into
which payments are made, for example by nominating an alternative bank 
account or the account of a 'trusted friend' which is permissible under 
our current rules on benefit payment.

'This is a practical measure to ensure that payments reach our customers
promptly, and we are not advising these customers to close their 
Cypriot bank accounts.

'Customers who do not currently have another bank account may wish to 
open one.

'HM Treasury have also worked with Barclays to put in place a 
process so that individuals can open a bank account quickly if they wish
to do so.'

The freeze on benefit payments into Cypriot bank accounts was announced 
by Treasury Minister Greg Clark last week amid reports that the 
government in Cyprus was planning a levy on all accounts to fund a 
bailout.

The plan was rejected by the Cypriot parliament, but banks have been 
closed since in a bid to avoid a run on the island's banks after a new 
deal which will use savings over £85,000 to pay off struggling lenders.

The
rescue package will wind down the largely state-owned Popular Bank of 
Cyprus, also known as Laiki, and shift deposits below 100,000 euros to 
the Bank of Cyprus to create a 'good bank'.

Deposits above 100,000 euros in both 
banks, which are not guaranteed under EU law, will be frozen and used to
resolve Laiki's debts and recapitalise Bank of Cyprus through a 
deposit/equity conversion.

Banks
have been closed since March 16 to avert a run on deposits as the 
country's politicians struggled to come up with a plan that would raise 
enough funds to qualify for an international bailout.

All except the country's two largest 
lenders had been due to open today after the country clinched an 
11th-hour deal with the 17-nation eurozone and the International 
Monetary Fund.

But last night the Central Bank said 
that 'for the smooth functioning of the entire banking system, the 
finance minister has decided, after a recommendation by the governor of 
the Central Bank, that all banks remain shut up to and including 
Wednesday'.

ATMs have been functioning, but many 
run quickly out of cash, and a daily withdrawal limit of 100 euros (£85)
was imposed on the two largest lenders, Bank of Cyprus and Laiki.

Mr Clark said the goal was to ensure that payments reached their intended recipients.

Mr Webb said the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and aims to minimise disruption for those affected.
