Relentless: The grieving mother of Gregory Spring, 17, who killed himself last Monday says he's been taunted even after his death

A tormented 17-year-old continues to be bullied even after his suicide.

On the message board of the Olean, New York funeral home where Gregory Spring's memorial service was recently held, someone wrote ‘Ha ha. He died. I hope he is in hell.’

Keri Spring said her son, who suffered from Tourette syndrome and a brain malformation called callosum cysgenesis, was bullied for years and that the problem had recently worsened.

Since beginning tenth grade at 
Allegany-Limestone High School, she said Greg had suffered greatly. He 
took his own life last Monday.

Spring said Gregory was bullied from the fourth grade until his death and, it appears, even thereafter.

The guest book for Gregory's memorial is still up at the website of the Casey Halwig & Hartle Funeral Home, though the disparaging comment WIVB reports was left for him appears to have been removed.

In
part, his suffering was due his brain condition, an absence of the 
connection between the left and right lobes, that made it tough for him 
to understand things.

Taunted: Local news station WIVB reports that a comment celebrating Spring's suicide was posted to the message board of his funeral home, though it appears to have been taken down

Suffering: The 17-year-old, who suffered from Tourette syndrome and a brain malformation, had recently broken up with a girlfriend and, his mother says, was bullied since 4th grade

He’d also recently lost his girlfriend. And, Spring said, a newcomer to his school had quickly become Gregory’s bully.

Gregory’s condition caused him to wonder why the bullying was happening.

‘He just wanted to be accepted,’ Spring said. ‘He was very compassionate, very emotional, very loving.’

At one point, Spring said her son even pleaded with his bully.

‘There came an incident,’ Spring told WIVB, ‘where Greg actually picked him up and said, “Stop bullying, bullying isn't good. Bullying is only going to hurt people.”’

No idea: Greg's mother said her son was suffering silently. She's now speaking out in hopes others will learn from his tragedy

'Emotional person': Gregory loved soccer, hunting, and woodcarving. His mother says his brain condition prevented him from understanding negative things like bullying

But instead of punishing the bully, Spring said Gregory was suspended from school.

Once she learned of the message scrawled online against her deceased son, she and her husband decided to speak out.

Denial: School district superintendent Dr. Karen Geelan released a statement saying an internal investigation revealed 'the young man was not bullied'

They contacted the local news to tell their story in the hopes it can help others.

‘When a bully is brought to your attention, it needs to be hit head-on and stopped immediately,’ Spring said.

Spring said her husband contacted their state senator about the need for tougher anti-bullying laws.

Area
superintendent of schools Dr. Karen Geelan responded to the assertion 
that bullying drove Gregory Spring to suicide in a statement:

‘Any
allegation of bullying is taken very seriously. I have conducted a 
thorough investigation and to the extent we can determine it, I have 
determined the young man was not bullied. Based on information received 
from the police, the untimely loss of this student's life may be 
attributed to a factor or factors altogether unrelated to bullying.’
