A schoolboy was airlifted to hospital after being hit by a piece of adventure playground equipment that collapsed on top of him.

Authorities were alerted of the nine-year old youngster's accident by onlookers, and he was immediately taken away for emergency treatment by the air ambulance.

The boy was playing with his friends in the park in Crawley, West Sussex on a Easter holiday day out.

The playground where the incident happened is thought to be part of this installation at the Cherry Lane Adventure Playground

He was injured by a pole that came loose from the playground structure and struck him.

The accident caused him a head injury that had to be treated by emergency services.

A number of police cars and paramedics attended the scene at the Cherry Lane Adventure Playground.

In addition, the police cordoned off the adventure playground with police tape, so that other children could not use it.

Health and safety officials have been alerted to the state of the playground following the incident.
