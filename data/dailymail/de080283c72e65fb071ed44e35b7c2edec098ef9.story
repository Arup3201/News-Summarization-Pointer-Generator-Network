This is the shocking moment a convicted Muslim extremist warned there would be a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding.

Afsor Ali, 27, who worked in security on the London Underground, was captured on video telling viewers not to attend the event on April 29, 2011, at Westminster Abbey in London.

Under the alias Abu Assadullah, he can be heard warning there is a 'high possibility of an attack' at the 'royal wedding'.

Warning: Afsor Ali, 27, is captured on video warning there will be a terror attack during the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding. Under the alias Abu Assadullah, he says there is a 'high possibility of an attack' 

In the footage, posted on YouTube, he also tells viewers that the British public have ‘no one to blame except themselves’ because they failed to condemn the government.

In addition to the video, Ali kept a stash of terror manuals on his MP3 player, owned a copy of the al-Qaeda magazine Inspire with a guide on how to make bombs and fire an AK-47, and branded the 9/11 terrorist atrocity 'an historic event'.

Now, he has been jailed for two years and seven months after being convicted of three out of four counts of possessing terrorist material at London's Old Bailey.

At an earlier hearing, Ali, from Bethnal Green, east London, had admitted possessing someone else’s UK passport in an unsuccessful bid to flee on the Eurostar to Paris in March.

And today, he also pleaded guilty to a bail offence by failing to attend a court in February.

Ali was handed a 16-month jail sentence for the passport offence 
and an eight-month term for skipping bail, to run concurrently, as well as a 
further 15-month sentence for possessing terrorist material.

Sentencing Ali, Judge Charles Wide QC told him he had made a 'really determined attempt' to evade justice.

He said the defendant had lied in his evidence in a bid to make the jury believe that while he was 'radical and committed', he was 'not an extremist and did not support terrorism'.

He told Ali: ‘During the trial you tried to give the jury impression that although you were radical you weren’t an extremist and didn’t support terrorism.

'It is absolutely clear you are an extremist and you do support terrorism. You deliberately tried to tuck this material away in a series of subfolders.

'Had you had the intention of using the material the sentence would have been very different.'

He continued: 'While you were on bail, subject to strict conditions, you did not report to the police. Sadly action was not taken as early as it should have been.

'You then made a really determined attempt to flee the jurisdiction. You acquired somebody else’s passport. I am told you had a lot of money on you. It is very obvious you were getting help. You are not just a loner. That is a very serious matter.'

Dressed in a cream tunic and hat, Ali stood impassively in the dock throughout the hearing before being led down to the cells.

Earlier in mitigation, his lawyer Naeem Miam argued that Ali had made no attempt to disseminate the terrorist material and there was no suggestion that he was himself a terrorist.

During the trial, jurors were told Ali 
was first arrested in December 2011 when he took part in a protest 
against American drone attacks in Pakistan alongside members of the banned group Muslims Against Crusades outside the U.S. embassy.

He was released without charge, but during the investigation an MP3 player was seized, while a laptop and external hard drive were taken from his home during a search.

When the items were examined, they were shown to contain documents that were useful to terrorists, the court heard.

When police searched Ali's home months later, they found his new computer also contained extremist material, jurors were told.

Oliver Glasgow, 
prosecuting, told the court Ali had promoted extremism in YouTube videos
 under the alias Asad Ullah, which means ‘Lion of God’.

He cited the two clips in which the defendant warned of a terror attack at the royal wedding and bragged about the 9/11 attack.

The jury was also told that police recovered two personal recordings of a telephone call between Ali and the radical Islamist Shaykh Omar Bakri Mohammed.

The defendant also possessed a transcript of a speech given by Omar Bakri, in which he seeks to legitimise suicide bombings.

On November 29, 2012, Ali was charged with possession of documents or records containing information of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism contrary to Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000.

He was found guilty of possessing two electronic files containing Inspire - the al Qaida magazine - and an electronic file containing 39 Means to Serve and Participate in Jihad.

He was found not guilty of a fourth count.
