A campaign to help elderly people use the internet to develop passions including travel and cooking has been turned into a new documentary.

Cyber Seniors follows a group of senior citizens aged between 76 and 93 as they discover the world of the Internet through the guidance of teenage mentors.

The film recently premiered in Los Angeles and New York and is currently being screened across the US.

The group featured in the film all had different interests, with some eager to get onto Facebook to see photos of their grandchildren and others wanting to learn how to cook or find inspiration for travelling.

The film also features the elderly group competing to get the most hits for an online YouTube video. 

It includes 89 year-old Shura who decides to create a YouTube cooking tutorial while another member of the group, 93-year-old Marion, is shown making a rap video.

The documentary, directed by Saffron Cassaday, was inspired by a campaign set up by her sisters Macaulee and Kasha five years ago.

The pair began recruiting friends to visit a local retirement home twice a week to teach elderly residents how to use the Internet after witnessing first-hand how it had transformed their grandparents' lives.

After learning some basic skills, their grandparents were in touch several times a week by email, Facebook and Skype.

'Our goal is to get as many seniors on the internet as possible – especially as when seniors age they can become isolated,' Macaulee Cassaday said. 

'We really want to get them on the internet to stop that isolation and get then connected again.'

Julia Marrocco started volunteering with the program when she was in high school.

'I'm always on the computer, so to me it was like: "I'm doing this anyway I may as well help someone learn what everybody else is using and help them get connected into that whole world that exists out there",' Marrocco said. 

'I grew up with a computer in my house. To me a computer is as simple as picking up a pen, so having to learn how to really explain something and take your time I think is rewarding.'

Ellard, 89, was originally interested in reuniting with his friends from World War II, but instead turned his interest towards reconnecting with his estranged daughter via Skype.

At 76-years-old, Annette was the youngest senior of the group. She wanted to get online so she wouldn't miss out on party invites, and is also shown being introduced to online dating.

The film has partnered with the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) Foundation, which is also trying to encourage seniors citizens to get online.

Director Saffron Cassaday said: 'I just think the internet has really changed the way that we communicate. 

'In the past, senior citizens lived with their kids and grandchildren in the same house, then they lived in the same town, now we have families who are living across the world from each other.

'The rest of us adapted by staying in touch through technology, but they've kind of been left behind and left out of that. 

'As they get older, they can't move around as much; they can't fly to Australia or another country to visit family members. 

'The internet really does help them to reconnect with family members that they don't get to do that often.'

Asked what had most surptised her about making the films, Saffron added: 'I think it taught me that you can have a lot of fun in your later years and that retirement age isn't something to be afraid of.

'I think a lot of people dread getting older and think that there's no fun to be had, and that's just not true. 

'People are living way longer now and they're living healthy, happy lives. A lot of these senior citizens weren't sitting around bored. 

'They're active, they're out there, they have busy schedules. It's good to know that there are things to look forward to in later life.'
