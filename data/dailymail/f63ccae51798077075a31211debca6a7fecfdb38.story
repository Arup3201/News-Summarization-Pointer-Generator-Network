It has survived devastating fire, earthquake and swinging spending cuts during its 140 year history.

But now it looks as if America's oldest aquarium will have to shut its doors to the public once and for all.

The small, 10,000-square-foot National Aquarium - which has recently undergone a five-year, $2million renovation - will close unless a wealthy donor can come to the rescue.

Closing time: The National Aquarium, in Washington, DC, which is home to more than 1,500 animals, will close its doors to the public for good today

The aquarium, initially established in southwest Cape Cod in 1873, was handed to the Department of the Interior in the 1940s.

It
 has been operating out of the Commerce department's lower level since 
the early-1930s.

But in May, the board of directors announced 
that the aquarium, which employs 43 staff, had outgrown its current building and would close on September 
30, according to news website Mother Jones.

All the animals - more than 1,500 creatures including alligators, sharks, and turtles - would have to be removed by March 2014, unless a benefactor can help.

Many of the animals go directly to the National Aquarium's sister facility in Baltimore's Inner Harbor.

Since it was established, the aquarium has weathered a host of different 
storms threatening its existence.

In June 2004, a fire in the Herbert Hoover building disrupted 16 of the venue's 80 exhibits.

In August 2011, a 5.8 magnitude earthquake rocked DC, but luckily left the animals unscathed.

In
 early 1981, president Ronald Reagan proposed $31 billion in spending 
cuts, including the aquarium's entire budget for that year - $289,000 it 
had been guaranteed by the Carter administration.

The aquarium had been seen as a huge waste of money by some in the media.

National Review contributor James Kilpatrick said: 'There exists in the basement of the Commerce Department building a second-rate, no-account, downtrodden facility known as the National Aquarium.'

He added: 'If the aquarium syndrome sufficiently infects the body politic, the [fiscal] mess we are in will get worse.'

In early 1982, all federal funding was pulled for good.

But a campaign to save the aquarium, called the Friends of the National Aquarium, only grew stronger. It lobbied Congress aggressively, demanding restoration of the budget.

The aquarium was allowed to remain as a private facility, under the sponsorship of a nonprofit society whose board included the wives of Reagan cabinet officials including the secretaries of Commerce, Agriculture, and Transportation.

The aquarium has hung on ever since, persisting on a shoestring budget derived from entrance fees and donations. But today the death knell finally sounded.
