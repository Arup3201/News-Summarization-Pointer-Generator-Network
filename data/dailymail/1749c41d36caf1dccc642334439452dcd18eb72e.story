Diners enjoying lunch when the Boston Marathon bombings went off are making good on the checks they were forced to run out on.

Tony Castagnozzi, owner of Rattlesnake Bar and Grill on Boylston Street, a few blocks from the blasts, said he has received a flood of calls from customers wanting to give their credit card details as well as checks in the mail since the April 15 terror attack.

'I was speechless. ... You see there are so many good people out there. It makes you feel good,' Castagnozzi said.

Speechless: Tony Castagnozzi, pictured, who has owned the Rattlesnake on Boylston Street for 23 years, said he was shocked when the checks started to pour in

The restauranteur, who's owned the bar for 23 years, was left with more than $3,000 in unpaid tabs when the blasts went off and police evacuated his customers.

He was happy to write off the expense given the gravity of the situation, but he's already recouped more than $1,200 of what was owed - with cash flowing in from all around the country.

'They all said, "Listen, we were there, having a good time, and we want to pay our tab,"' he told The Boston Herald.

Good people: A marathon-goer from Denver, Colorado, who had a $91 tab was the first to call Castagnozzi, pictured right with a customer, and clear his debt

A marathon-goer from Denver, Colorado, who had a $91 tab was the first to call in and clear his debt.

He gave his credit card details over the phone.

Since then, patrons from Florida, 
Virginia, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and across Massachusetts have 
settled up with the popular restaurant.

'It's
the right thing to do, isn't it? At least in my mind it is,' David 
Christmas, a 16-year Boston Marathon veteran from Acton told the Herald.
He sent in $50 to cover his $35 bar tab and a tip.

Blasts: The Rattlesnake restaurant is located a few blocks from the finish line of the marathon, where the blasts were detonated on April 15

Aftermath: Tables and chairs of restaurants can be seen blown apart and scattered in the aftermath of the Boston bombings, though this image does not show the Rattlesnake Bar

Evidence: Investigators spent days combing the area at the finish line of the Boston Marathon for evidence, which meant local businesses lost out on more takings

The other stand-up diners have added generous tips as well for the waitresses who were left emotionally scarred from the blasts and without one of their biggest paydays of the year.

'They didn't expect anything,' Castagnozzi told the Herald. 'Marathon day is our busiest day of the year. And they work hard. So they were pleasantly surprised.'

A handful of customers who were evacuated from the Charlesmark Hotel have also settled up their tabs since the blasts, the Herald reported.
