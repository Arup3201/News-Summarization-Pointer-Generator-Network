The traditional Christmas chocolate treat Ferrero Rocher is under threat from a shortage of one of its main ingredients - hazelnuts.

Production of the chocolate - famed for its cheesy adverts set at an ambassador's reception - has been hit a global shortage of hazelnuts caused by a washout of crops following bad weather.

The cost of hazelnuts has increased by more than 60 per cent already this year after hail storms and frost obliterated crops in Turkey, where about 70 per cent of the world’s hazelnuts are harvested.

Ferrero, the Italian parent company, buys a quarter of Turkey's annual crop for it's products, including Nutella, the chocolate spread. 

It has resulted in a stark increase in the wholesale price of the nut, which rose to £6,300 ($10,500) per tonne from just £3,900 ($6,500) per tonne in February.

While the extent of the damage to the hazelnut flowers on Turkey’s Black Sea coast is not yet fully evident, it is feared about 300,000 tonnes of the crop could have been damaged in March’s poor weather.

The company told The Sun it does not expect any production problems.

The news comes after continued warnings about the rising cost of cocoa which has continued to soar as demand outstrips production.

Experts have warned that a growing taste for chocolate in Asia – particularly in China – means cocoa farmers will need more help to provide a greater amount to

export or manufacturers will be forced to use less cocoa in their products.

It is feared the rising demand could become unsustainable by 2020, unless more is done to help cocoa growing communities.

The threat of a global shortage of both cocoa and hazelnuts comes as bad news for chocolate makers – many of whom combine the ingredients for their products.
