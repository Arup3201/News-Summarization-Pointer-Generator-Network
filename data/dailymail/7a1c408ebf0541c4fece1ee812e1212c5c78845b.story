As creative consultant for luxury leather goods brand Smythson and ambassador to the British Fashion Council, Samantha Cameron is usually admired for her chic, pared-back style.

However, opinion was divided on the unusual 'half-calf' boots with neoprene panels she wore yesterday on the school run.

As the name suggests, ‘half-calf’ boots 
sit higher than ankle boots but fall some way short of the knee. Unlike 
ankle boots, which stop at the narrowest part of the leg, these draw 
attention to the calf.

Unflattering: Samantha Cameron wore a pair of £80 'half calf' boots on the school run in the London sunshine on Tuesday but fashion critics weren't impressed

Some critics carped that the usually 
impeccably dressed 
42-year-old had missed the sartorial mark - mainly due to pairing them 
with a knee-length skirt, which had the effect of truncating her long, slim legs.

As Samatha has found, they are not the easiest style to pull off. But whoever said fashion was easy?

They have been identified in fashion circles as a key trend for autumn, with similar shapes appearing on the Stella McCartney, Chloe and Jason Wu catwalks and now filtering on to the high street. So, if you're tired of ankle boots and bored of bikers, why not give them a whirl?

On trend: Teaming these boots with a knee-length skirt was a mistake, say fashion critics

If you're looking to jump on the trend without breaking the bank, Topshop offer their AEON Neoprene Chelsea Boots for £78.

Got some cash to splash? Then Charlotte Olympia's £911 'Lucinda' mid-calf boots will fit the bill.

To help you avoid a SamCam-style footwear faux pas, we have called in some of the industry's most reputable stylists to give their verdict on how to pull off the look.

Toni Jones of blog 30ish Stylist, said: ‘SamCam’s feet are suffering from transitional trend issues.

'Most women with their finger on the fashion pulse will have snapped up key pieces for their autumn wardrobe already, especially coats and boots as these are the first things to sell out, but the long summer is leaving us itching to wear our new season buys.

'It seems that Sam couldn’t wait to wear her Stella copies with trousers or tights and has taken a leaf out of the street style stars hanging around fashion week tents in midi skirts, bare legs and clumpy ankle boots.

'"F-ugly" boots are the ultimate way to toughen up a girlie look and very hot right now.

'Samantha definitely has the legs for this look, but unfortunately only a 20-something can pull of such a contrasting style with conviction. Killer studded courts or even a patent brogue would have been a cooler option.’

Fashion stylist Courtney Smith who has worked with Kelly Rowland and Sarah Harding, said: ‘Actually, as far as half-calf boots go, these aren’t the most unflattering I've seen. She's lucky she has slender legs, however it definitely isn't doing any favours at lengthening them or making them appear slimmer.

'Black tights would work really well here, as they would elongate the leg and blend into the boots.

'The main problem is the length of the skirt teamed with those boots. If the skirt were shorter, it would balance out the legs and body better than the midi style she's chosen.'

Laura Puddy, who styled One Direction on X Factor, added: 'SamCam is always super stylish but wearing these boots with black opaque tights or jeans would be much better than a bare leg as it would streamline the look.'

The rest of her outfit, however, was 
more in keeping with her usual elegant look.

She opted for a navy 
jacket and fitted dress and carried a £595 putty-coloured bag from the 
Chameleon Collection by Smythson.

The Prime Minister's wife's bag collection included two dove grey styles and a blue tote bag, all by luxury leather brand Smythson
