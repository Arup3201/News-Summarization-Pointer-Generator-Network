Sergio Ramos declared himself happy with Spain's progress as Vicente del Bosque's side put their dismal World Cup behind them with a 5-1 win over Macedonia.

Goals from Ramos, Sergio Busquets, Pedro, David Silva and Paco Alcacer provided a comfortable victory over Macedonia in their European Championships qualifier. Agi Ibraimi scored for the visitors.

Spain endured a difficult World Cup in Brazil where they arrived as champions and left at the earliest opportunity having won just one game.

But Real Madrid defender Ramos was pleased with his country's first competitive game since Brazil.

The 28-year-old said: 'We need to have patience and confidence in what could develop with all the people coming in. It's been a positive start and we must continue along this line.'

Meanwhile Valencia striker Alcacer marked his international debut with a goal.

He told TVE: 'I'm very happy for the game, for my debut here at Levante's ground, in Valencia my home, and above all for the goal and win. It's been great.

'This team has a lot of quality and it was only a matter of time that the good performances and goals arrived.'
