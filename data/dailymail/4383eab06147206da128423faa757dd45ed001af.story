Yob: Richard as he was before becoming Becci Allen

A 24-stone self-confessed soccer hooligan has turned his back on the macho world of terrace violence to undergo a sex change.

Burly Richard Allen, 36, lived for brawling with rival fans at England and Exeter City games and admits he was a die-hard yob.

But Richard has shown hooliganism the red card and after he shed seven stone has swapped football shirts for frocks and embarked on a new life - as Becci.

Becci said: 'I had been on a 
colourful path with anger and got into trouble with the police a few 
times. I went to football games with Exeter City, Spurs and England and I
was a hooligan.

'I used to beat people up. I was always fighting something I wanted to be.

'I
am not proud of what I used to do but it has all gone to shaping the 
way I am today - I am finally getting the life I was meant to live.'

Becci, of Alphington, Devon, knew from the age of eight he wanted to be a woman.

But
rather than explore his feminine side he surrounded himsef with tough
friends and behaved as 'manly' as possible to release his pent-up 
anger.

Decades later Becci finally sought medical advice and has now begun the male-to-female transition.

He is undergoing hormone treatment and voice therapy ahead of a full sex change operation on the NHS.

Homebase
worker Becci said: 'I spent a lot of time suppressing it and trying to 
fit in. I was trying to conform to the male form and I did live an 
unhappy life.

Becci says he is a different person now after ditching the macho world

'I didn't used to have many female friends. I was envious and jealous of them so I built my life around a male environment.

'I decided at the age of 32 to make changes. I got to the point in life where either I did this or my life would be ended.

'I have now gone completely the other way and am now the person I should have been.

'For the first time ever I am just happy.'

Becci says he is enjoying single 
life after coming out of a 12-year relationship and insists he has the 
full backing of her family since deciding to dress as a woman.

He even broke the news to his boss over a McDonald's meal - but said he was equally supportive.

And
Becci stresses that just because he prefers to be a woman does not 
mean having to give up being a big fan of football or darts.

Becci said: 'I had a lot of fears about coming out but you need to overcome them.

Richard has shown hooliganism the red card and after shedding seven stone and embarking upon the journey towards a full sex change, he is embracing his girly side

'I
have lost seven stone in weight as I have been a lot more active but I 
am not as strong as I was and I am learning about my limitations.

'And if I am dressed inappropriately my friends will tell me to go home and change.

'I have not been to St James' Park for a while because of the trouble I got into, but I am a different person now.

'Having a sex change does not mean I have to stop going to football or darts.'

Describing his former days as a football hooligan, sex swap England, Exeter City and Spurs fan Becci Allen told how he targeted rival supporters - before dishing out brutal beatings.

Six foot two inch Becci said: 'If there was a City-Argyle game we would just go down there and basically beat the crap out of whoever was supporting Argyle.

'Obviously not the kids or the women, but any men that were wearing an Argyle shirt. We'd just beat them up. We went for the rival fans, only the people that were looking for it.

'To be honest, I only did a few games at City but I was a bigger England fan - beating up the Swedes was good fun.

'I was the quiet one that suddenly flipped. It was always fisticuffs. If you can't fight with your fists there's no point fighting.

'This was only at the weekends, during the week I was a family man. I do feel remorse now but I can't change what happened, I can only look forward and build a better life.

'I still have an England tattoo on my arm that says Loud and Proud and I have no plans to get rid of it. It's not very girly but it's part of me.'

Becci has an 11-year-old daughter, Nicole, with Paula, an ex-partner of 12 years.

Speaking of the effect Becci'sÂ  lifestyle change has had on her relationship with estranged Paula, he said: 'Paula probably took it like anyone else would have taken it. That's probably why we're not together.

'She was supportive though. She hasn't given me any hassle. We've just gone our separate ways.

'I've got a daughter who is 12 in June. I haven't seen her for three years and I really, really miss her. Hopefully one day she will come and find me.

Becci has been supported throughout her transition by the Exeter-based Laurels service, run by the Devon Partnership NHS Trust

'My family and friends are amazing. 
I'm really blessed. I'm a really happy go lucky person who loves life so
maybe that's the reason I've got so many friends.

'They just love me for me.'

Becci now has C-cup breasts because of the hormones he takes and has grown out his skinhead haircut into a red bob.

He sees himself as a regular woman leading a regular life.

Becci added: 'I really enjoy a game of darts. I go to the pub as often as possible.

'I've been to a Guns N' Roses concert and a Madness concert. I go everywhere now, lead a completely normal life.

'I haven't yet been to an England game but I plan to get back into it again.'

Becci has been supported throughout his transition by the Exeter-based Laurels service, run by the Devon Partnership NHS Trust.

Clinical team leader Maria Morris 
said: 'People do bottle their feelings up for many years and there are 
often people with a history of doing very masculine things such as being
in the forces or married two or three times.

'Telling family, friends and work colleagues can be a traumatic thing to do.

'Some
people are disowned by their families and have been declared freaks. We
become their family then and help them live a life.'
