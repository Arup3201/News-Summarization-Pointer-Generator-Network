Elton John has been told to lose his flamboyant stage costumes for an upcoming concert in Russia - or face protests by anti-gay campaigners.

The singer, who will play in the southern city of Krasnodar next month, has been told by a communist group that his usual outfits are 'homosexual propaganda' that could breach local laws where promoting homosexuality is a criminal offence.

The country's Communists of Russia party has instead suggested that the 66-year-old performer should wear 'more respectable' traditional Cossack clothes for his concert.

Elton John has been warned to wear 'respectable' dress for his gig in Russia next month - or face anti-gay protests

The singer, best known for his hit Candle In The Wind, wed David Furnish in a civil partnership in 2005

Local party leader Mikhail Abramyan recommended that Elton don a knee-length kaftan, knee-high leather boots, and a fur hat for the July 14th gig.

He said: 'It would be more respectable.  We have suggested it to the promoters and we hope he'll wear it.', according to Russian news agency Ria Novosti.

The communist group leader said his 350 members were ready to protest in the streets if the singer did not dress appropriately.

A spokesman for Elton John did not wish to comment this afternoon.

'Promoting homosexuality' is an offence in several Russian regions, including Krasnodar, St Petersburg, and Novosibirsk.

Last year Madonna was sued by Russian anti-gay groups for £7m for violating the local laws after they claimed her concert in St Petersburg, in which she spoke in favour of gay rights, 'promoted homosexuality'.  The lawsuit was later thrown out of court.

Cossacks in traditional dress marched through Krasnodar earlier this year to celebrate their heritage
