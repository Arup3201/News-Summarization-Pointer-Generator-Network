Paul Gascoigne has said he has been 'bled dry' by hackers who took £50,000 from his bank account

Former England star Paul Gascoigne has been 'bled dry' by hackers who took £50,000 from his bank account.

Gascoigne, 46, who has been battling alcoholism for years, has said the thieves made 23 withdrawals in the space of just two days, it has been reported.

Speaking outside his Bournemouth home, the former Newcastle, Tottenham Hotspur and Lazio star claimed he knew who was responsible before admitting he did not understand how it had happened.

Speaking to The Sun, he said: 'I know who did it. I know how it f****** happened, there were 23 hits in f****** two days. It was quite a lot of money.

'It wasn't that much. F*** knows. I don't know. Website, internet, I've not got a clue.'

Gascoigne, once believed to be worth £14 million, reportedly said between £9,000 and £50,000 had been stolen.

In a documentary aired by ITV this week he described the pain of knowing he might start drinking again even though he recognises it might kill him. 

Widely regarded as one of the most talented footballers of his generation, Gascoigne told film-makers he had been 'lucky twice' after almost dying from drink.

He said: 'I hope I don't die through it. Because I won't get any sympathy... because well he was warned. At least I know if I did pass away through it I wouldn't be in this pain all the time.'

Last week it was reported Gascoigne spent £4,000 in just a few hours during a drunken betting spree.

Witnesses said they saw the troubled England legend dropping bundles of £20 notes at a bookmakers following a two-day drinking bender.

Staff at the Coral shop in Boscombe, near his Bournemouth flat, eventually had him ejected, according to reports.

An onlooker told the Daily Star Sunday Gascoigne was 'swaying' and a worker behind the counter said he has spent thousands.

Gascoigne has battled alcoholism for many years and was sent to rehab in America in February.

The £100,000 stay was organised and paid for by his host of famous friends including Radio 2 presenter Chris Evans and TalkSPORT presenter and former England cricketer Ronnie Irani.

The move came following a charity appearance in Northampton during which the star appeared unwell and shaking, before breaking down and sobbing on stage in front of a room full of fans.
