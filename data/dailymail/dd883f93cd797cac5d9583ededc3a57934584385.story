Manchester City players will cheer on World Cup final team-mates Pablo Zabaleta, Martin Demichelis and Sergio Aguero from another famous sporting venue on Sunday night.

City’s squad will watch the Argentina-Germany clash from the home of golf at St Andrews. They are staying at a hotel next to the Old Course after Sunday’s friendly against Dundee.

It is likely to be the first time three players from the same English club have played in a World Cup final since 1966 when England’s Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters were all at West Ham.

City midfielder Samir Nasri offered a good luck message, saying: ‘We will be right behind you, we are going to watch the game together and support you from Scotland.’

Only two players from the Premier League have previously started in World Cup finals for the winning team — Franck Leboeuf (Chelsea) and Emmanuel Petit (Arsenal) for France in 1998.
