Eight men who held down an armed robber so hard he died were acting within the law, a coroner has ruled.

Clint Townsend died of a heart attack after the have-a-go heroes piled on top of him during a raid at Oxford's Covered Market in March last year.

The 33-year-old, who was wearing motorcycle gear and a helmet, had smashed the window of a jewellery shop repeatedly with a sledgehammer, before wrestling with the store's manager and owner.

'Within the law': A coroner has ruled the men were 'brave' and acting lawfully when they piled on top of Townsend for three to four minutes in the diamond merchant shop in Oxford's historic Covered Market

But witnesses rushed to restrain him, and held him to the ground 'in a big heap' for three to four minutes when police officers arrived.

Townsend was heard to say 'I can't breathe', before falling unconscious.

Despite numerous resuscitation attempts, he was left in a coma and died the next day.  

Alison Thompson, assistant coroner for Oxfordshire, reached a verdict of misadventure today and said: 'I am not satisfied to the required standard of proof that any of those men acted unreasonably and unlawfully... There has been a deliberate act but the consequences and the fatal outcome was not intended by those people.'

She praised the men's bravery in detaining Townsend in a 'terrifying situation,' and called the robbery 'a reckless attack.'

A pathologist, who performed a post-mortem examination on Townsend's body, discovered he had severe heart disease and one coronary artery was clogged to just one millimetre of blood flow.

Mrs Thompson said: 'I don't think there was any idea from anybody involved of what was going to happen because of his heart condition. He succumbed and gave up the struggle much more quickly than anybody realised because his heart was failing.'

Six-foot-tall Townsend and an accomplice were dressed in motorcycle leathers and had the visors of their helmets pulled down as they walked towards John Gowing Jewellers pushing a stolen Kawasaki motorbike at 9.15am on March 30 last year.

The accomplice stayed with the bike as Townsend rained blows on the store's display window with a sledgehammer. A number of smoke grenades were also thrown into the shop, the coroner heard.

The shop's manager Andrew Hill and owner John Gowing grappled with the raider - who hit Mr Hill with the sledgehammer and head butted him with his motorbike helmet - before onlookers intervened.

The accomplice ran off, leaving the motorbike lying on the floor, and witness accounts varied between there being three and eight people restraining Townsend on the street outside the upmarket store.

Police were on the scene within minutes and realised Townsend had stopped breathing. 

Officers started CPR and called for an ambulance, which took him to John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford at 9.44am.

Townsend, of Headington, Oxford, was found to have been left brain dead by oxygen starvation to the brain and was pronounced dead at 1.15pm the next day.

Mrs Thompson made it clear in her findings that the misadventure verdict referred specifically to those who had restrained Townsend.

'It was an intended and risky activity which had unintended consequences,' she said.

Townsend's parents, sisters and girlfriend Hailey were present at the inquest, but made no comment after the coroner's findings.

Speaking after the hearing, Detective Sergeant Ali Driver, who led the investigation, said: 'I think the coroner rightly mentioned the bravery of those people who got involved. 

'It was a very frightening event for those people not used to dealing with physical violence. I think everybody has acted incredibly bravely.

Family: Relatives arrived at Oxford Coroner's Court to hear the verdict of the inquest this morning

His family declined to comment on the outcome of the inquest after the coroner gave a verdict of misadventure

'This was a tragedy for all involved and our thoughts and feelings go out to the family of Clint Townsend as they continue to come to terms with his loss.

'Our thoughts are also with those involved in the restraint of Mr Townsend - none of whom wished the outcome to be as it was, and all of whom believed that they were doing the right thing.'

Three men were arrested after the incident. One, aged 44 years, was released without charge, while two others, both aged 32 years, remain on police bail.

The police are understood to have no plans to charge anyone in relation to Townsend's death.
