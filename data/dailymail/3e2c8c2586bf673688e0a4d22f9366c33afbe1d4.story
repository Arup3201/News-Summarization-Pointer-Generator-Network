A science teacher who was fired for keeping a Bible 
on his desk has is taking his battle to the Supreme Court today to prove that his dismissal is against the constitution.

John Freshwater says the Mount Vernon school board in central Ohio 
violated his constitutional free speech rights and did not make it clear
what was acceptable in his classroom before firing him two years ago.

Investigators say he preached 
Christian beliefs in class when 
discussing topics such as evolution and homosexuality and kept a Bible 
on his desk even after the school district told him not to.

Making his case: John Freshwater addresses a crowd on Mount Vernon's public square in Mount Vernon, Ohio. The public school science teacher who kept a bible on his desk and was accused of preaching religious beliefs in class.

Freshwater also was accused of using a piece of science equipment to burn students'
arms with the image of a cross. Parents complained and filed lawsuits.

Two lower courts previously upheld Freshwater's dismissal, but the 
state Supreme Court has now agreed to hear a portion of his claims over his 
firing. The hearing was to be held on Wednesday.

Freshwater can argue it is unconstitutional to fire 
someone without clear guidance on what teaching materials or methods are
acceptable. Freshwater also can argue it is unconstitutional to fire 
someone over the mere presence of a religious text such as the Bible in a
classroom.

As an eighth-grade science teacher, Freshwater tried to encourage his
students to examine facts, theories and hypotheses and then question
them and differentiate between them, his attorney said in a court 
filing last year.

A voluntary discussion of creationism or 'intelligent design' as part
of the mandatory discussion of evolution is unquestionably part of a 
secular education program, attorney Kelly Hamilton wrote.

'Freshwater did not engage in religious proselytization - he 
discussed a scientific theory that happens to be consistent with the 
teachings of multiple major world religions,' Hamilton wrote.

The board's actions, he concluded, were nothing less 'than the censorship of ideas'.

Freshwater is getting legal backing from the Charlottesville, Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, a civil liberties group.

Attorneys for the school board countered that Freshwater had long tried to push religion in the classroom.

As far back as 1994, a middle school principal told Freshwater to 
stop distributing an 'Answers in Genesis' pamphlet with information 
about a creationist organization's upcoming seminar, according to a 
filing by board attorneys asking the court to uphold Freshwater's 
firing.

Freshwater also used a handout titled 'Survival of the Fakest', to 
teach his students to doubt science, the board's attorneys said.

'Whenever Freshwater was told by a superior to cease using an 
inappropriate handout in class, he would simply find another one to 
use,' the board's attorneys said in a filing last fall.

Science education and humanist and secular groups have joined the side of the school board.

The board once concluded Freshwater had used a high-frequency 
generator, which other teachers have used to demonstrate electrical 
current, to burn a cross onto a student's arm. The cross lasted a few 
weeks.

The student's family settled a federal lawsuit against the district in an effort to move on.
