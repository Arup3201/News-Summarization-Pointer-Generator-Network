Newly-released audio from a 911 call has revealed the shock and disbelief witnesses had after a Wu-Tang-affiliated rapper's self-castration and leap from a second-floor balcony of a North Hollywood apartment.

Andre Johnson - who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar - was reportedly high on drugs when the bizarre April incident occurred, and the witness who placed the emergency call couldn't believe what he had seen.

'We have a friend over here and… we don’t know if he’s alive or not [after jumping from] the second floor… I don’t believe this s**t,' said the unidentified person.

Andre Johnson, who goes by the stage name Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, has revealed that he wants to star in a porn movie to prove that his manhood remains fully functional

The caller claimed he and a couple friends were on the balcony when Johnson jumped from the balcony. The audio was first made public by TMZ.

It was later reported the 40-year-old rapper was high on the drug PCP, also known as angel dust. The psychedelic is known for causing people to jump from ledges because they think they can fly.

Loud screaming can be heard in the background. The person on the phone claims it is Johnson. He also says at least one child who witnessed the ordeal, but it is not clear if either of his daughters was present.

'I guess he’s alive, he’s screaming, but you need to hurry,' he tells the 911 dispatcher. 'There’s a puddle of [blood]’

The man then starts talking to another person in the room.

'What a stupid mother f****r, make me call the police. This is the worst s**t I ever seen in my life.’

Police soon arrive.

'You gotta come get him, he cut his damn penis off,’ he can be heard telling cops. 'We were sitting on the balcony and this mother f****r just came and [jumped]'

The 911 audio emerged almost two months after Johnson broke his silence about the ugly incident, saying depression drove him to do it.

High on drugs: Seen here performing as Christ Bearer in the group Northstar, Johnson was reportedly high on angel dust at the time he jumped

Johnson told TMZ last month that he was smoking weed and reading a book about monks and vasectomies right before the self-castration.

He said he felt his 'world was collapsing' after being prevent from seeing his two daughters due to a restraining order, and that he had a third child on the way.

TMZ also reported that Johnson's member was able to be reattached by doctors.

While he claims he will be able to regain full functionality, having more children will likely not be possible.

The incident occurred at an apartment compex about 1am on Wednesday April 16.

Police classified the case as an attempted suicide.

Friends within the building said Johnson managed the mutilation quickly before running and jumping over the ledge.

However E! Online reported that the rapper cut off the tip of his penis first, then removed his testicles and the remainder of his genitalia.

Johnson was high on PCP at the time, E! reported, citing police sources..

When people from the building ran downstairs to see if Johnson had survived the fall, they said he was already on his feet screaming.

He was found in critical condition before he was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

The organs were recovered upstairs inside the apartment.

Neighbors initially said Johnson did not seem to be under the effect of hard drugs.

In dispute: Johnson (right) said he had been smoking weed, not doing PCP, and reading a book about self-castration at the time of the ugly April 16 incident

Northstar is described on the Wu-Tang website as a duo from the north side of Long Beach who have produced songs warning of the dangers of drugs and saluting their own Muslim beliefs.

In 1998, they were discovered by Wu-Tang member RZA, who produced some of their albums.

As Johnson's unfortunate incident hit headlines, RZA moved to distance himself for the rap duo, releasing a statement he has had nothing to do with them for 10 years.

PCP is a 'dissociative drug' meaning that it distorts perceptions of sight and sound and produces feelings of detachment from the environment and self. 

First introduced as a street drug in the 1960s, PCP - which comes in crystal form but is often smoked with a herb like mint or marijuana -  quickly gained a reputation as a drug that could cause bad reactions and was not worth the risk. 

However, some abusers continue to use PCP due to the feelings of strength, power, and invulnerability as well as a numbing effect on the mind that PCP can induce.

The dispatcher is bold. The caller is only italic when talking to others.
