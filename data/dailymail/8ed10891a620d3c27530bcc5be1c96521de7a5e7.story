Three people were arrested after police attended a student sit-in at Warwick University.

West Midlands Police said that they were responding to an alleged assault on a university staff member.

A video which was posted on YouTube but has now been made private, shows police dragging a protester to the floor, and the sound of a Taser can be heard.

A tweet from the West Midlands Police account said a Taser 'was drawn but not deployed. The sound is a warning sound'.

In another video an officer appears to tell protesters to 'back off or you'll get CSed'.

Protesters can be seen being dragged onto the floor and physically removed from the building.

The group, Warwick For Free Education, said that they were staging a peaceful sit in at Warwick University's Senate House in protest at rising tuition fees and high wages for university management.

However, a spokesman for Warwick University, which is based in Coventry, said that university security staff who were supervising the sit-in were subject to a 'shocking and unprovoked act of violence' which forced them to call in police.

A statement on the Warwick Free Education website alleges that activists were 'punched, pushed onto the floor, dragged, rammed by their throat into the wall and kneed in the face.

'At least 20 students were assaulted by university security and police.'

A student at the protest told the Coventry Telegraph: 'A police officer took out his CS spray and sprayed it in one person's eyes and then into a crowd of about ten people.

'A Taser was taken out and was being made to crackle by pressing the trigger, but it wasn't used.

'It felt particularly disproportionate. When the police came they didn't say why they were there.

'A lot of younger students were visibly shaken and left in tears. It was quite a shock, especially considering that it was a quiet protest - we weren't even shouting.'

A spokesman for West Midlands Police said: 'Police were called to reports of an assault at the University of Warwick Central Campus in Coventry this afternoon.

'Officers arrived at Senate House at 4.50pm to find a group of around 25 students protesting about fees and a staff member reported that he had been assaulted by one of the group.

'Three people were arrested from the site, one on suspicion of assault and two others on suspicion of obstructing police.

'Police officers and security staff from the university worked together to ensure everyone was safe. 

'The protest continues and officers remain at the scene to ensure there is no further breach of the peace.' 

Shortly before 9pm West Midlands Police posted two tweets on its official @wmpolice account, saying: 'The protest at the University of Warwick Central Campus remains on-going. Three people have been arrested following reports of an assault.

'During the disorder a Taser was drawn and an audible and visible warning was issued to prevent further incidents. The Taser was not fired.' 

But a statement from Warwick Students' Union said the force used by officers was 'disproportionate'.

It said: 'This afternoon, a group were demonstrating for Free Education and entered the lobby of Senate House. The police arrived and an altercation took place, the full facts of which we are still in the process of establishing. Three people were arrested.

'From the footage we have seen of this incident, we absolutely believe that disproportionate force was used against protesters. We stand in solidarity with the Warwick students who were unnecessarily harmed in this action.

'The Sabbatical Team will be attending the peaceful demonstration happening on Thursday at 3.30pm. We will also update students further with a full statement tomorrow.'
