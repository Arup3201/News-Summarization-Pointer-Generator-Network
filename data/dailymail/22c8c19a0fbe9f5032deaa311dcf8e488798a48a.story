There has long been a theory that smoking more potent cannabis is actually healthier than puffing on a less powerful joint.

The thinking is that when people smoke high-potency cannabis, they compensate for the potency by inhaling less smoke.

But now this theory has been partially debunked by researchers.

People who smoke high-potency cannabis take in more of the drug's active ingredient, THC

If this was accurate, it would mean they experience the desired high while doing their lungs less damage.

However, Dutch research has now revealed this theory is not accurate.

The scientists, who published their findings in the journal Addiction, discovered that people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale more of the drugâ€™s active ingredient, THC.

They say that while these smokers do reduce the amount of smoke they inhale, they still take in more THC than people who smoke lower potency cannabis.

This is because of the higher THC content of high-potency cannabis.

As a result of consuming more THC, they are more likely to become addicted to the drug.

However, as they inhale less, they do take in a smaller volume of smoke.

Despite this, they still inhale harmful smoke.

To make up for the additional strength of the drug, people who smoke high-potency cannabis inhale less. This means they take in slightly less harmful smoke

To conduct the study, the researchers observed 98 cannabis smokers as they rolled and smoked cannabis of varying concentrations.

Those who made strong joints inhaled smaller volumes of smoke, presumably in an attempt to reduce the amount of THC taken into the body.

But these efforts were only partially successful, compensating for roughly half of the THC strength.

So, although smokers of strong cannabis alter their smoking behaviour to compensate for the higher potency, they don't alter it enough to make smoking high-strength cannabis the healthier option.
