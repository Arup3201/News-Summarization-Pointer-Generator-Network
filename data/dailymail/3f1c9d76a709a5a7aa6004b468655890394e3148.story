The mayor of Calais yesterday begged David Cameron to come to France and tell migrants that Britain is no El Dorado.

Natacha Bouchart also repeated her threat to blockade the town’s port to make the UK change its ‘generous’ welfare and asylum policy.

‘Everyone who comes to Calais, comes because they believe they will be looked after if they get to Britain,’ said the tough-talking politician.

Showdown: Natacha Bouchart demanded David Cameron come to Calais to deliver an ultimatum to migrants

‘Under British rules they get free accommodation, they can work on the black market easily and they are given money.

‘For poor people from Africa this is very attractive. Britain is too soft on migrants.

‘I demand that David Cameron comes to Calais and gives the migrants a strong message that Britain is not an El Dorado.’

Migrants – many from Eritrea – began their attempts to overwhelm the ferry terminal last month. French authorities believe they keep trying because they know of friends who have reached Britain.

Mrs Bouchart said the number of migrants in Calais was intolerable and the town was suffering alone.

‘Britain is ignoring us,’ she added. ‘No one has ever come to visit, no one answers my letters. We are fed up with the British attitude.

‘If the UK government does not listen I will block the port. We are 75,000 people. If we all go to the port together we can block it.

‘This is illegal but is it fair to leave us as we are?’

Mrs Bouchart also demanded the dismantling of Britain’s border control at Calais and financial compensation for the cost to the town of the immigration crisis. She said: ‘If we move the border back to Dover you [the UK] will have to deal with the problem of migrants.’

Mrs Bouchart wants to open a Sangatte-style centre in Calais providing shelter, food and information on asylum to migrants determined to reach the UK.

And yesterday she repeated her call for welcome centres across France giving migrants advice on claiming asylum in Britain.

Jean-Marc Puissesseau of the Calais Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which runs the port, said: ‘The situation is unacceptable, the port is under siege.’

Yesterday hundreds of migrants at a sprawling camp close to the port vowed to reach Britain, or die trying. Almaz, 23, from Eritrea, said: ‘Every night I try to get into a truck going to England.

‘I have been arrested by the police many times, beaten and had gas sprayed into my face. But I will get to England or die trying.’

Mustafa, 24, also from Eritrea, said: ‘I have lived through a year of hell to get this far.

‘I am not going to stop now. I have crossed the desert, been jailed in Libya and crossed the sea to Italy in a small boat.

‘But I will forget it all when I get to England. I will be safe and free.’

Last night there were growing calls for action from British politicians.

‘We need to strengthen our border force at Calais,’ said Philip Hollobone, Tory MP for Kettering.

‘And we need to stop these people before they reach Calais and before they reach the UK.’

One 24-year-old living near the port, who gave his name as Mustafa and said he was from Eritrea, said: 'I have lived through a year of hell to get this far. I am not going to stop now. I have crossed the desert and been jailed'

French authorities are struggling to maintain order with up to 2,000 people living in makeshift camps and squats in and around the town.

The number of migrants found hidden in vehicles in Calais in 2014 is expected to reach 30,000.

The influx dramatically increased earlier this year when the crisis in Libya allowed migrants from Eritrea, Ethiopia and Sudan to reach Europe from the North African coast.

Armed gangs fight pitched battles for control of the best vantage points from which to break into trucks boarding ferries to Dover.

The worsening security situation has led haulage firms to advise drivers to avoid Calais.

But migrants are now targeting other Channel ports too.
