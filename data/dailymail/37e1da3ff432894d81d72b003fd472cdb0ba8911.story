A German intelligence 'double agent' who allegedly sold hundreds of top secret documents to the US was only caught after trying to broker an additional deal with Russia.

Details of the deal, to the Russian secret service, emerged yesterday after Chancellor Angela Merkel's government summonsed the US ambassador to Berlin.

It is the second case of suspected US intelligence spying against Germany within a year.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has summonsed the US Ambassador to  discuss the 'double agent'

Eight months ago German-US relations 
became tense after it was revealed that Mrs Merkel's phone had 
been bugged by the US National Security Agency.

On Friday, Germany's Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) intelligence service admitted that one of its agents had been arrested for supplying American intelligence with at least 300 top secret documents over a period lasting several years, The Independent reported.

Three of the documents are believed to have related to German investigations into US surveillance and phone bugging.

The as yet unnamed 31-year-old was caught by his own country's counter espionage agents and is in German police custody.

The spy was said to have supplied the US National Intelligence Service with at least 300 top secret documents

German intelligence sources revealed that the US spy may have operated undetected for years and that he passed on information at secret locations for about £8,000 a time.

It also said he established contact with the US through a simply email to the Amercian embassy.

The agent's arrest was raised at meeting of a German parliamentary committee tasked with investigating US surveillance scandal.

There is speculation that Germany will get their own back on the US by inviting CIA whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify against the NSA before a Berlin parliamentary committee

Reports suggest the double agent was only discovered after he tried to supply information to Russia, again by simply sending an email to their embassy.

BND agents were said to be 'stunned' by the discovery, as were German MPs.

Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere told Bild newspaper: 'I expect everyone now to 
assist quickly in clearing up the accusations - and quick and clear 
statements, from the USA too.'

It has been speculated that Germany may get one back on the US by inviting whistleblower Edward Snowden to testify against the NSA before a Berlin parliamentary committee.

However, Mrs Merkel's the government has so far ruled that out.
