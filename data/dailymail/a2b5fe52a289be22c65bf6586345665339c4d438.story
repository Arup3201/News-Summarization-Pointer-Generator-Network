When comedian Laurie Kilmartin got the devastating news that her 83-year-old father was dying from lung cancer, she turned to humor – and social media - offering touching and wildly sarcastic updates on her dad's deteriorating condition.

Kilmartin has been hard at work giving her rapidly growing number of followers the blow-by-blow account of her father's decline since February 22.

But it was not until Wednesday that the Emmy-nominated satirist's live-tweeting has gone viral.

‘Losing Dad, gaining followers. The Lord truly works in mysterious ways,’ the comic wrote to her 14,900 fans, and counting. 

After six rounds of chemotherapy and a week of radiation treatment, Korean War veteran Ron Kilmartin was admitted into a hospice facility February 20.

Miss Kilmartin, a staff writer on TBS' 'Conan' best known for being a finalist on season 7 of Last Comic Standing, has been sharing with the world her experience of losing her father before her very eyes.

Her tweets range from the deeply sarcastic to heart-breaking, from darkly funny to wistful and genuinely sweet. 

‘It appears that Dad will die as he lived, covered by horrible crocheted blankets,’ she joked.

On Monday, she wrote: 'First 2 days of Dad's hospice, I wouldn't leave the room w/o telling him "I love you." Now we're into day 5, I just say "We're cool, right?”'

In another message brilliantly mingling sadness and humor, Kilmartin said that her father indicated for the first time that his pain level was at a ’10,’ but she wryly remarked  ‘that could've been because we were watching The View.’

In one of the more heartfelt tweets on her account, Kilmartin shared: ‘Hard to leave Dad's side. I am drawn to him like a moth to a flame (that's about to go out).'

While many of her followers, including 
actor and comedian Patton Oswalt, have embraced Kilmartin's unique 
approach to dealing with loss, others have criticized her for making 
light of her father’s impending death.

In a tongue-in-cheek post, Miss Kilmartin explained to her detractors what her ultimate goal is.

'Guys, I'm just trying to grieve in advance, so I can relax and have fun at the funeral,' she wrote.

It was Mr Oswalt, a star of 'Young Adult' best known for his voiceover in Pixar's 'Ratatouille,' who put Miss Kilmartin's live-tweeting exercise on the map when he described it as 'epic' to his 1.6million followers Wednesday.

User Bill Jensen raved: ‘If @anylaurie16 doesn't win a Pulitzer for her father's-deathbed tweets, the whole award system is a sham.’

The 140-character messages have allowed an unflinching look into Kilmartin's relationship with her octogenarian dad, including their political differences: Mr Kilmartin is a conservative and a big fan of Glenn Beck, while his daughter is a liberal.

'Dad just let me turn on MSNBC during a Fox News commercial break. Time for Last Rites,' Miss Kilmartin quipped this afternoon.

An hour earlier, she tweeted in the same 
vain: 'How I check that I've put Dad's hearing aids in correctly. 
Whisper "testing, testing, Obama is a Muslim," then look for the thumbs 
up.'

She went on: ‘Can't bear to see cancer devour my Dad. Gonna give him a heart attack instead by showing him how much $$$ I've donated to MoveOn .org.’

For the past two weeks, Mr Kilmartin has been in the care of his wife of 55 years, Miss Kilmartin and her sister, who is a doctor. 

Laurie Kilmartin also has been bringing her 7-year-old son to the hospice to spend time with his grandpa, and the boy has offered his own take on the situation.

Viral sensation: Kilmartin, an Emmy Award-nominated writer on 'Conan', has drawn thousands of followers on Twitter after actor and comedian Patton Oswalt praised her updates about her father

‘I said, "Grandpa's dying," and my 7 yo son looked up at me with his big brown chocolate drop eyes and said, "what about his iPad?"’ the comic tweeted.

Miss Kilamrtin is not the first to live-tweet the passing of a parent. As Daily Dot reported, NPR’s Scott Simon famously gave regular updates on Twitter describing his mother's final days in 2013.
