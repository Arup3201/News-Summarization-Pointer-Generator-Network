It can't be said that Mother Nature does not have a sense of humour, as parts of the UK found themselves under a layer of snow on the first day of spring yesterday.

Hailstorms lashed parts of the South and snow fell on hills in Cumbria, North Wales and the North East. And it is not looking much better today, with the mercury expected to plummet to -6C (21F) overnight.

This morning’s frost will be a disaster for the many gardeners who rushed to plant spring plants during the recent balmy spell. Sales of bedding plants ‘went bananas’, growers said.

Wide parts of Britain had a frosty start 
this morning with temperatures expected to plummet as low as -3C tonight
 across parts of northern England and Scotland.

Hailstorms surprised residents of Wiltshire and Hampshire this afternoon with some able to collect entire jugs of the balls of ice.

Army cadets and horses battled a hail shower at the Gatcombe Horse Trials at Gatcombe Park, the private country home of Princess Anne in Gloucestershire.

Meanwhile, two men are recovering after they had to be rescued from an attempt to climb Snowdon.

The pair, both 25 and from Walsall, sparked a full-scale emergency after they got caught up in a snowstorm yesterday afternoon.

A Sea King helicopter from RAF Valley in Anglesey could not reach them because of cloud, so four members of the Llanberis mountain rescue team were tasked to find the pair.

In a two-hour operation, the men, who were cold and exhausted, were helped back down the mountain to safety.

A mountain rescue spokesman said: 'They were not carrying the right equipment, such as ice axes, for the conditions and got stuck at an altitude of 2,500ft on the Crib Goch ridge.'

The unexpected weather - just two days after the spring equinox - is set to continue today with hail showers predicted in Kent and heavy rain showers predicted in the East Midlands and south east.

Otherwise, though, forecasters say last night's snow does not look like it will be repeated, with showers becoming increasingly confined to eastern Britain tonight with any remaining sleet and snow giving way to sunshine and light winds.

The wet and snowy weather took a brief pause this afternoon as the clouds parted and sunshine broke through long enough for rainbows to have been spotted in parts of London and Nottingham.

Meanwhile, the wintry weather took a break as a rainbow appeared above St Peter's church in Nottingham after a sudden downpour

And in London a colourful rainbow briefly broke out over the London skyline during a sunset rainstorm

Most parts of Britain will have a dry, clear and cold night with a sharp frost.

Tomorrow rain and brisk winds will spread eastwards but many central and eastern parts of the UK should stay dry with sunny spells.

There will be no return to the warmth that saw people stripping off in parks and on beaches, however, with temperatures not expected to lift beyond 10C for most of the rest of the week.

At the world's only mute swan sanctuary in Abbotsbury, Dorset, the animals finished enjoying last week's warm weather just in time - with the laying of the first eggs of the year.

The first one was spotted on Thursday by deputy swanherd Steve Groves in a nest close to the feeding area at Abbotsbury Swannery, near Weymouth.

Now there are almost 20 as the numbers of swans making nests continues to increase.

Scores of swans return annually to Abbotsbury to raise their young, which usually hatch in the second and third weeks of May.

Hideaway: The traditional home with snow on the roof, an unusual sign for March. Apart from some hail showers in Kent, no more snow is predicted in the next few days

The attraction, which has existed for at least 600 years, only opened to the public yesterday for the summer season after struggling through a winter beset by floods.

Dave Wheeler, head swanherd for more than 30 years, said: 'We didn't know what to expect because of the terrible floods - the site was submerged twice in February and a lot of things were damaged.

'Last year, the first egg was laid here on April 1 but back in 2012 the first egg was laid on March 14 - so we never can predict timings.

'The eggs are now coming thick and fast. We're not sure if we'll beat last year's total of 100 swan nests, but the first egg has been a good sign of things to come.'

Despite the rush of cold weather, so many eggs could prove a good omen, claimed Mr Wheeler.

'Old Dorset legend has it that the day of the hatching of the first cygnet is the first day of summer,' he said. 'If we assume that this first swan spends another week laying eggs, then summer could be just six weeks away.'
