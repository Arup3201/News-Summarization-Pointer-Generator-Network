A Colorado dad just wants his family back for Christmas after his 6-year-old daughter was abducted by her mother. 

The girl, Eden Nunn, may be in danger and both she and her three siblings were taken by her mother after her father was granted full custody.

Father Dayton Clevenger said he fought over Eden's custody for years and now with a ruling in his favor had hoped to finally have time with the girl.

But Eden was taken by mother Brittany Nunn, who has since disappeared with her husband at the end of November

'Once she gets going she is willing to laugh and giggle,' he told KMSP-TV. 'She likes to play games. She likes to color a whole bunch.'

But Eden was taken by mother Brittany Nunn, who has since disappeared with her husband at the end of November.

She has also vanished with her three younger children from their Colorado home.

'It's really hard,' Clevenger said. 'Hard to deal with not knowing where she is. I try not to think about how long I'm going to have to wait to see her again so I don't want to have to dwell on it.'

Grandmother Dawn said she was terribly worried. 

'A lot of tears and frustration, missing my granddaughter,' she said. 'Wanting her to be here, to be in a safe environment. She's not in one right now.'

It's believed the missing girl could be in Colorado, Wyoming, or Minnesota.

The Missing Children Minnesota and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children have included her on their registries. 

And the family is begging the public for help.  

'If Eden happens to see this is in Minnesota and just that I love her… I do love you Eden and I hope you know and remember this and know that I love you,' she said. 'Anyone, anywhere, don't be afraid to spread the word so that I can see Eden again.'
