A cancer-stricken bride who was granted her dream wedding just weeks ago thanks to generous donations has lost her battle with the disease.

Jen Bulik-Lang, 35, passed away in her home in Mountain View, California at 8am on Thursday with her husband at her side.

'It was beautiful,' her husband Jeff Lang said in a phone call to NBC. 'Very peaceful.'

He said his wife, who was told she had four to six months to live when she learned she had stage IV lung cancer in January, had had periods of confusion over the last week and was sleeping a lot.

In love: Jen Bulik, who married husband Jeff Lang just seven weeks ago in California thanks to a generous wedding planner and local companies, has lost her battle with lung cancer

He added: 'She may have left her body, but she is still with me. She always will be.'

The couple wed just seven weeks ago thanks to a generous wedding planner who was moved after she read their story on Facebook.

After
a friend of the couple wrote about their story on a Facebook page for 
wedding planners, Erica Ota quickly got in
touch with them, NBC Bay Area reported.

She rallied more than 30 wedding vendors in the Bay Area to donate 
their services for free and spotted another opportunity when she stumbled upon Ms Bulik's Pinterest page, discovering a collection of images showing exactly how she wanted her dream wedding to be.

Adoration: Mr Lang said that his wife's death at their home on Thursday morning was very peaceful

'This was an opportunity I saw to do something extraordinary for somebody else,' the San Francisco-based social worker-turned-wedding planner explained.

With the help of the local community,
Ms Ota managed to acquire goods, decorations and services for the 
wedding in just two weeks. The total cost, $50,000, was given to the couple entirely for free.

'It was my goal to have them not pay a 
dime,' she explained, adding: 'These people have suffered enough. Why 
not give them... a gift that both of
them... and their families will never forget.'

The couple, who had been together for six years, were visibly taken aback by Ms Ota's kindness, as well as that of the vendors she contacted.

Chic: The wedding took place on Saturday afternoon, under sunny skies and Red Wood trees in a park near Ms Bulik's parent's home - which later hosted the garden reception

Generosity: The total cost of the beautiful day came to $50,000 - and it was given to the couple for free

'I'm in awe, I'm speechless,' Jen said at the time. 'It's amazing, the generosity in 
their heart, and that they're so touched by
our story.'

'For
me this whole process has been really difficult, and today was easy,' 
said Mr Lang after they said their vows. 'We just showed up and did our thing. It gets more and more magical with every moment.'

The wedding planner told the Mountain View Voice that other wedding features included a photo booth, New Orleans jazz band, a taco station and a guest book quilt.
