Liverpool have suffered their first snub in the search for a new manager - and it has astonishingly come from Brendan Rodgers.

The Swansea boss was one of the contenders to replace sacked Kenny Dalglish at Anfield but he has decided to reject the opportunity to talk to owner John W Henry.

It is the first setback for Liverpool, who have approached at least four high-profile names, including former Barcelona boss Pep Guardiola.

Anfield officials cast their net as wide as possible in their search to replace Kenny Dalglish by sounding out Guardiola and former England boss Fabio Capello. They have also made formal moves to speak to Roberto Martinez of Wigan, and are considering Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp.

A Swansea statement read: 'Swansea City can confirm that an approach from Liverpool FC to speak to manager Brendan Rodgers was officially received by club chairman Huw Jenkins this morning.

'The club is pleased to confirm that Brendan has declined the current opportunity to speak to the Anfield club about the vacant position.

'The Swansea manager is currently working hard to strengthen the squad in readiness for the new Barclays Premier League campaign.'

Rodgers, 39, signed a new three-and-half-year deal in February, made a huge impression by guiding Swansea to an 11th-place finish in their maiden Premier League campaign.

The Welsh club rounded off their season by beating Liverpool 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium, a fixture which proved to be Dalglish's last in charge of the Reds.

Swansea's attractive possession style of play also won former Reading and Watford manager Rodgers plenty of admirers, and chairman Huw Jenkins has admitted the Swans will have to become used to their boss being linked with other clubs.

Rodgers is due to fly out to Austria this weekend as he gets the chance to spend four days with world and European champions Spain at their pre-Euro 2012 training camp in Schruns, before heading to New York to take in Wales' friendly with Mexico.

On the shortlist: Former England boss Fabio Capello has also been approached by Liverpool

Wigan chairman Dave Whelan confirmed he had given permission for Martinez, the bookmakers’ favourite to replace Dalglish, to speak to Liverpool’s American owners Fenway Sports Group.

Sportsmail understands the discussions were positive, to the point Martinez is giving serious consideration to succeeding Alex McLeish rather than leaping into the highly-scrutinised role at Anfield.

Liverpool have made it clear that Rodgers and Martinez were not the only candidates on their list and they will not rush any decision.

The owners are eager to gather as much information as possible before they fill the post and Henry will leave no stone unturned in his bid to find the best man for the job.

Guardiola is available after deciding to take a year away from football after a remarkably successful spell at Barcelona.

Man of the people: Former Wigan player Roberto Martinez is idolised in Greater Manchester

Didier Deschamps, the Marseille manager who almost succeeded Rafa Benitez in 2010, remains highly-regarded at Anfield, while Borussia Dortmund’s Jurgen Klopp and the Holland national coach Bert van Marwijk also have their admirers. Former Chelsea boss Andre Villas-Boas could also come into contention.

The sense of farce at Anfield deepened as the American owners managed to score another PR own goal over Luis Suarez.

Days after sacking the long-serving director of communications Ian Cotton — clearly a casualty of the Suarez debacle — an American journalist who has worked for Sports Illustrated and ESPN called Jen Chang was appointed in the role.

But on his Twitter account on December 20 Chang responded to the news of Suarez’s eight-match ban by stating that Patrice Evra, the victim of the racist abuse, should have been charged by the FA too.

Chang wrote: ‘Suarez decision aside, why is Patrice Evra not getting charged by FA? Evra admits in evidence he used insulting language towards Suarez.’

Whichever manager takes over from Dalglish, the task facing them will be enormous and Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre has admitted the club have to make the biggest decision in their modern history.

Ayre expanded on the reasons for ending Dalglish’s 16-month reign and revealed that not even a win in the FA Cup final earlier this month against  Chelsea would have been sufficient to save his job.

Liverpool are seeking their fourth manager in less than two years and Ayre said: ‘It’s absolutely critical we get it right and we move forward. It’s where the club has to be. It’s where everyone wants it to be.

‘When John (W Henry) and Tom (Werner) arrived, they said they wanted to win. You can only live on  history of success for a certain amount of time. I am under no illusion that we can find a top-class  manager to come to this football club.’

On the decision to axe Dalglish, after he had won the Carling Cup and taken Liverpool to within a whisker of following up in the FA Cup, Ayre added: ‘It was a very simple decision based on results and if we believed that was going to change.

‘We were 37 points off the winners (Manchester City), 17 points off fourth (place) and had 14 losses. It was never about an individual result – and rightly so. It was always about taking a review of the stock of the season in full.’

Liverpool’s continued absence from the Champions League, coupled with their failure to challenge at the top of the Barclays Premier League, has led to a dip in their global appeal. A recent survey revealed they are only the fourth most popular English club in South East Asia.

This, clearly, will be a defining summer and Ayre knows steps need to prevent Liverpool becoming a relic. He said: ‘That is why it is so critical.

That is what everyone is working for. Nobody is looking for average, mediocre progress. We are looking for progress that will get the club back where it needs to be.’

Dalglish’s assistant Steve Clarke offered his resignation out of loyalty but it has not been accepted by the club.

Several players, including Suarez, Lucas Leiva and Jamie Carragher, expressed their sorrow that Dalglish had left, but the most poignant tribute came from Steven Gerrard.

The Liverpool skipper, who has just been appointed England captain, said: ‘The last 24 hours have been a rollercoaster. Kenny is my idol and always will be.’

Dalglish said on Twitter on Thursday night: ‘Overwhelmed by support of the fans. Always been special but even more so now. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. YNWA and I never have.’
