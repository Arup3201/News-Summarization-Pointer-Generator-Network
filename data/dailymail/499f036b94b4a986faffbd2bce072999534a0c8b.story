Chelsea star Ramires flashes a grin as he bumps into ex Blue teammate Demba Ba in Turkey.

Jose Mourinho's side have jetted out for a pre-season charity tournament where they play two 45 minute friendly matches against Besiktas and Fenerbahce.

Senegalese striker Ba, who scored 14 goals in 51 matches during his 18 months at Chelsea, left Stamford Bridge for Besiktas last month after falling down the pecking order behind new signing Diego Costa and Fernando Torres.

But Ba seemed happy in his new surroundings as he chatted to the Brazilian midfielder ahead of the event which will raise funds for the families of the 301 people killed in May's Soma mining disaster.

He also caught up with old pal Eden Hazard after the game. 

An explosion and subsequent fire left 787 workers buried underground leading to a four-day rescue effort and three days of national mourning. It was the worst disaster of its kind in Turkey.

Goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer was photographed wearing a T-shirt in support of those affected.

Happy times: Demba Ba and Ramires celebrate goal during Chelsea's match with Sunderland in December 2013

All of the players donned the shirt during the warm-up. 

The games should give Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho another chance to work out his best XI ahead of the Premier League season, while giving his World Cup stars another chance to impress.

Fenerbahce also boast one-time Blues midfielder Raul Meireles in their ranks.
