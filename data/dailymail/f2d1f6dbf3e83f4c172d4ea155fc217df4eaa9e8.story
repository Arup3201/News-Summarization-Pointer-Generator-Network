This is the 13-year-old schoolboy who was offered a £400 loan with payday loan firm Wonga that would have taken him almost 100 years to pay off.

If Drew Dalson had accepted the 5,853%-interest deal, he would have had to pay back the cash after just 18 days with £56 interest.

The Dundee schoolboy told The Daily Mirror he gets £5 a week pocket money and it would have taken him 98 years to pay back the debt 'if he was good'.

Offer: Drew Dalson was offered a £400 loan with Wonga, which would have taken him 98 years to pay back

Shock: His father Brian, pictured with a copy of Wonga's offer, said he was shocked that the firm would encourage a boy of his son's age to borrow such a large sum of money

His 52-year-old father Brian said it was strange when a letter turned up addressed directly to his son.

He opened it and was 'shocked' to find the firm offering his son such a large sum of money. 

'He’s a sensible lad and wouldn’t have done anything,' he said. 'But I’m sure there are other kids out there who would be tempted by such an easy fix, especially before Christmas. 

'What kid wouldn’t want £400 in his back pocket?'

Response: The company removed Drew from the database following the offer, left. It added that it did not make offers to under-18s

Wonga said it had removed Drew from its database - adding: 'We neither market nor offer loans to under-18s.'

However, the firm failed to explain how it
came to have the schoolboy's details, which would not have been on 
the electoral roll due to his age.

The offer comes just weeks after payday loan firms - including Wonga - were criticised for using catchy tunes and funny puppets to 'groom' children to become borrowers of the future. 

Consumer groups told MPs that the firms used daytime 
TV adverts to convince youngsters that the high-interest loans are normal. 

Criticism: Payday loan firms, such as Wonga, have been accused of using catchy tunes to 'groom' children to become borrowers of the future

Martin Lewis, the founder of website Moneysavingexpert.com, called for the ads to be banned from children’s TV - claiming: ‘These lenders are essentially grooming children to be the next generation of borrowers'.

He added: 'The payday loan industry insists it is not targeting children, but our research shows that kids are being dazzled by catchy tunes and cute puppets.

'The current explosion in the number of people borrowing in this way is nothing compared to how the next generation will act.’
