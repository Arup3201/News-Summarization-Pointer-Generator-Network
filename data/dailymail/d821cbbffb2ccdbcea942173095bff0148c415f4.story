The Formula One circus has parked up at the home of the World Cup winners for round 10 of the championship, and you can follow all the action from today's qualifying session at Hockenheim.

Host commentator

That's four poles in five grands prix for Rosberg. He waves to the crowd on his way back to the pits.

Hamilton will start 15th for tomorrow's race with Esteban Gutierrez serving a penalty for crashing into Pastor Maldonado at the British Grand Prix.

German GP Grid: 1 Rosberg; 2 Bottas; 3 Massa; 4 Magnussen; 5 Ricciardo; 6 Vettel; 7 Alonso; 8 Kvyat; 9 Hulkenberg; 10 Perez

The German didn't improve on his time, but it doesn't matter as Bottas only gets to within two tenths. Neverthless, an impressive run from the Williams driver.

Massa starts his final run, and he sets a PB in the opening sector, but is still a tenth down on Rosberg. His second sector is strong, too, but the Brazilian is now a couple of tenths slower than the German. He completes his lap with a 1:17.0, and improves on his time but is only third.

Vettel goes 4th fastest, but he is one second slower than Rosberg. Magnussen is up next followed by Ricciardo, Alonso, Kvyat, Hulkenberg and Perez.

Rosberg lights up the timesheets with a 1:16.540. That's a very strong time from the German. How will the Williams drivers respond? Bottas is through first and he is a mighty seven tenths slower than Rosberg, and what of Massa? He is third, seven tenths off the pace, too.

Perez is fighting to keep his Force India in a straight line, and he posts a rather disappointing 1:19.3. Indeed that is his worst of the entire session so far.

And it is the Force India of Sergio Perez who is the first driver to take to the track.

A dejected Button on traffic in qualifying: 'It doesn't matter. We did not get through and that is the main thing. I had a different balance on the last run, so not great. I have struggled all weekend. It has not been a easy weekend, but hey.'

A disappointing day for the Brits then with Button KO'd from Q2. He complained about traffic through Turn 13, but it doesn't look as though the McLaren man was really held up.

But he doesn't do it on that run, and it looks as though he will start only 11th for tomorrow's grand prix. How disappointing for the Finn.

Raikkonen takes to the track bidding to get into the top-10 shootout, but he needs to find three tenths in the final sector to do it...

Rosberg heads the field from Bottas, Vettel, Magnussen, Massa, Alonso, Ricciardo, Kvyat, Button and Hulkenberg. Raikkonen heading out here unless he can improve on his time; he's four tenths slower than Ferrari team-mate Alonso.

But what a time that is from Bottas. He goes almost one second quicker than Hulkenberg, but here comes Rosberg and he is some two tenths faster than the Williams man. Seven times posted so far with eight minutes remaining of the session.

And home favourite Nico Hulkenberg in his Force India is the first driver to take to the circuit. He posts a 1:18.270.

Mercedes have confirmed that Hamilton suffered a right-front brake disc failure.

Replays of that Hamilton accident showed him immediately taking his hands off the steering wheel. His inside front locked up, Mercedes rotated and smashed into the tyre barrier at around 160mph. It certainly looked like a brake failure on his Mercedes.

Sutil is the big-name casualty in that first session. Hamilton's time was good enough for 12th, but he will start 16th in tomorrow's race. Not what he needed after a hat-trick of disappointing qualifying sessions.

Maldonado, Sutil, Gutierrez, Kobayashi and Chilton occupy the bottom six places with three minutes left.

And on the supersoft tyres, Rosberg heads to the top of the timesheets after his two earlier errors. The German is over half-a-second quicker than Bottas.

The session is back underway and Rosberg is the first to take to the circuit. We've got a little over six minutes left. This is the first time Hamilton hasn't made Q3 since the 2010 Malaysian Grand Prix.

Hamilton locked his front brakes, but it looked as though something broke on his Mercedes. He certainly seemed a little bit shaken. Rosberg meanwhile, has work to do when the session re-starts.

Big crash for Hamilton. He loses the rear end of his Mercedes under braking and crashes into the tyre barrier. The Briton reports he is OK over the team radio, but he heads off in the medical car rubbing his knees.

And Rosberg makes another mistake down at Turn 2. The World Championship leader is struggling here. Meanwhile, it is confirmed that Ericsson won't be leaving the garage; a torrid weekend for Catheram.

That's a strong lap from the ever-impressive Valtteri Bottas who goes almost half a second faster than Hamilton. Rosberg yet to post a competitive time.

Normal order is restored as Lewis Hamilton goes over six tenths quicker than Magnussen. A big lock up for Rosberg, he runs wide, and he is forced to abort his lap.

But Austrian Grand Prix pole-sitter Felipe Massa heads to the top of the lap charts before he is usurped by Kevin Magnussen. The Dane posts a time of 1:19.379; only seven lap times posted so far. We have got 12 minutes left.

Four minutes of the 18-minute opening session gone, and it is Jenson Button in his McLaren who tops the timesheets at the present time. A quiet start to today's qualifying session so far.

And the Marussia of Jules Bianchi is the first driver out on track. Hydraulic failure on Marcus Ericsson's Caterham meanwhile, means it is unlikely he will make it out of the garage.

Qualifying has been Hamilton's achilles heel in recent times. He locked up on his final run in Canada, spun in Austria, and aborted his last lap at Silverstone. How will the Briton respond today?

* Lewis Hamilton's win in the British Grand Prix was the 27th of his Formula One career, equalling the feat of Sir Jackie Stewart. Nigel Mansell is the most successful Briton with 31 victories.

* Hamilton now has 61 podiums to his name (1st: 27; 2nd: 18; 3rd: 16). One more will equal David Coulthard's British record of 62.

* Nico Rosberg's run of 17 consecutive results in the points ended at Silverstone, with the German retiring for the first time since the Chinese Grand Prix in April 2013.* Mercedes have won eight of the nine races this season. Only five teams have scored more in a single campaign - Ferrari, McLaren, Red Bull, Benetton and Williams.

* Valtteri Bottas is the first Williams driver in nine years to score back-to-back podiums, with Nick Heidfeld the last to achieve the feat in May 2005. You have to go back to 2003, and Juan Pablo Montoya, for three or more in a row.

* Ferrari and McLaren have now gone 23 and 28 races without a win respectively.

* Up until last year Schumacher had been the only German name to have won the German Grand Prix, with Michael a four-time winner in 1995, 2002, 2004 and 2006, and brother Ralf a victor in 2001. Sebastian Vettel added his name to the German roll of honour last year.

* Only three circuits have hosted the German Grand Prix: Hockenheim (33), the Nurburgring (27, including races at the Nordschleife and current GP circuit) and a sole event at Berlin's Avus circuit in 1959.

* Ernst Christ, a one-time assistant timekeeper, is credited with the idea of building a circuit in his home town, Hockenheim. With support from the mayor and the local council, the first motorbike race was held at the circuit, then known as the Kurpfalzring, on May 25, 1932.

* A major layout revision in 1938 created the fast Hockenheim loop that would remain fundamentally unchanged until the end of 2001. A 62million euro (Â£52million) rebuild in time for the 2002 race gave the circuit its current form and increased spectator capacity from 83,000 to 120,000.

* Ferrari have an impressive German Grand Prix record with a mighty 21 victories, well ahead of nine wins for Williams and eight for McLaren

Germany can boast the reigning World Champion in Sebastian Vettel and in Rosberg the man whom leads the drivers' standings, but the turnout for this weekend's race has been poor. Stark contrast to Silverstone where stands were packed for all three days...

The air temperature is 32 degrees, and track temperature is over 50 degrees for today's qualifying session... the hottest of the year so far.

Not since the International Olympic Committee banned British cake decorators from making rings out of marzipan, have sporting officials been such party-poopers.

I got married to my beautiful girlfriend Vivian in Monaco last week and it was a wonderful experience. I wasn't sure if I would feel anxious about the occasion, but it was such a pleasure.

Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna has written a personal note thanking Formula One fans for their support following the seven-time world champion's skiing accident.

JONATHAN McEVOY: The two protagonists for the world championship, Hamilton and Rosberg, were more keen to play on their friendship than play up their animosity.

But it is Rosberg who holds the psychological edge heading into qualifying after topping the timesheets in this morning's final practice session... and by some margin, too.

The German was over six tenths quicker than Hamilton with Fernando Alonso the best of the rest in his Ferrari.

Good afternoon, petrol heads and welcome to our live coverage of qualifying for the German Grand Prix.

Nico Rosberg arrives at his home race four points ahead of team-mate Lewis Hamilton after suffering his first DNF of the season at Silverstone.

But his track record in Germany isn't good; he's never finished on the podium here - his best result was 4th back in 2009.

Hamilton in contrast, has been victorious on two occasions, in 2008 and 2011. And he starts this weekend as the bookmakers' favourite to complete a hat-trick of wins in Germany tomorrow.
