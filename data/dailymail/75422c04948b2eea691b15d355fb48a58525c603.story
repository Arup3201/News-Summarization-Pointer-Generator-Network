A plasterer who murdered his twin brother in a drunken fight on New Year’s Eve has been given a life sentence and will serve a minimum of 13 years.

Robert Cerqua, 32, was convicted yesterday of killing his brother Christopher, a carpenter, by a jury of nine men and three women at Winchester Crown Court after almost 16 hours of deliberations.

The trial heard that Cerqua stabbed his twin in a “fit of temper” following an argument that took place in the kitchen of the family house in Hythe, Hampshire, on December 31 last year.

Sentencing Cerqua, who was wearing a shirt and tie, judge Mr Justice Teare said: “You have been found guilty by the jury of the murder of your twin brother Christopher on New Year’s Eve last year.

“His death and its consequences have had, and will continue to have, a devastating effect on your parents and those close to you.

“You grew up with your brother and from time to time worked with him in the building trade. When you were both sober, it seems you got on well.

 

“But when each of you had too much alcohol, there was a risk an argument might break out leading to violence. That had happened before and it happened on New Year’s Eve.

“On New Year’s Eve you and he were drinking in the kitchen of your parents’ home. It’s unlikely that violence was on your mind or your brother’s mind when you started drinking.

“From 6pm to 8pm, it’s gathered from the record of text messages that all was well.

“However, as soon as you both drank more, it seems that you feared a fight might break out.

“Then an argument and a fight broke out, quite why is not known, but it did.

“Whether you picked up a kitchen knife from the worktop or your brother did is also not clear but what is clear is that you ended up with the knife in your hand and you stabbed your brother in the abdomen, causing a fatal wound.”

The court heard that Cerqua had served previous prison sentences for offences of battery and affray relating to domestic incidents involving his former partners.

He also had previous convictions for motoring offences and criminal damage.

Prosecutor Nicholas Haggan QC told the trial that Cerqua, who had been drinking, got involved in an argument with his brother which then turned violent.

He said the parents of the twins, Peter and Denise Cerqua, were present in the property, where both sons also lived, when the fight took place in the kitchen.

Mr Haggan said Mrs Cerqua dialled 999 to ask for police assistance and during the call, which was played to the jury, her husband called out to his wife asking for an ambulance before he shouted: “He’s stabbed him.”

The jury was shown photographs of the kitchen, which showed several crushed empty cans of Stella Artois lager alongside party food.

Mr Haggan said the defendant fled the property barefoot and called his girlfriend, who took him to a friend’s party where he continued to get drunk.

He said: “This is a tragic case. It involves the killing by this defendant, Robert Cerqua, of his identical twin brother, Christopher Cerqua.

“The incident which led to Christopher’s death occurred in the kitchen of the family home in Hythe, where both their mother and father were present in the house.

“In a nutshell, it was New Year’s Eve last year, both brothers had been drinking, shortly before 9pm an argument started between the two brothers.

“That argument appears to have turned into a tussle, punches may have been exchanged, at some point this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother Christopher.

“Having done so, the defendant fled the family home. He didn’t even stop to take the time to put on a pair of shoes before he left the house.

“He telephoned his girlfriend, who picked him up in her car and took him to a friend’s house where a New Year’s Eve party was in full swing.

“The defendant turned off his mobile phone which meant that he could not be contacted by the police.

“He stayed at that New Year’s Eve party until the police traced him to that address and he was arrested on suspicion of murder. By then he was very drunk.”

Mr Haggan said that Cerqua inflicted a single stab wound to his brother’s lower stomach which was about seven inches deep.

He said the defendant told police he had acted in self-defence.

He explained that DNA found on this knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile.

Mr Haggan said a blood test showed that Christopher had 230mg of alcohol in 80ml of blood - almost three times the drink-drive limit - and Robert told police he had drunk six cans of lager and two glasses of red wine before leaving the house.

He also told police that he had a “fiery relationship” with his brother and drink could make him “nasty” and “short-tempered”.

Robert Cerqua insisted he acted only in self-defence, but yesterday the jury of nine men and three women took 16 hours to find him guilty of murder.

He showed no emotion in the dock at Winchester Crown Court, where the verdict was met with a cry from the public gallery.

His murder trial heard an 'extremely drunk' Cerqua left barefoot after stabbing his brother with a kitchen knife, leaving a seven-inch wound in his stomach.

He joined his girlfriend at a New Year's Eve party and turned off his phone so he could not be reached, while his father Peter was left trying to stem Christopher's bleeding with a tea towel.

The professional carpenter had a cardiac arrest less than an hour later and was declared dead in hospital.

Police found Robert at a party in nearby Totton at 2.20am and told him what he was being arrested for - to which he replied: 'Murder?'

He then fell asleep in the back of a police car on the way to Southampton Central Police station, the court heard. When he woke up, he said: 'Is he dead? You are lying, he cannot be'.

While being taken to his cell, he added: 'Was it me? Was it me? I cannot remember. Honestly, is my brother dead?'

And when he was told the charge against him the next day, he allegedly said: 'I killed my f****** brother. I don’t want to be here any more.

'Nine times out of ten it would be all right. [That’s] just my luck, he had to die on me.'

Robert earlier sent a string of texts to his girlfriend, Joelle Mansfield, which revealed how the mood deteriorated, the court heard.

An earlier message from Cerqua read: 'I cannot wait to marry you!!! xxx', followed at 6.30pm by: 'Yes sexy. Chris wishes happy ‘New Year! xxx'.

But at 7pm he wrote: 'Me and Chris are going at it. Talking about past. We got things to sort out but all good. Enjoy your night my lovely, I love you'.

At 8:10pm he added: 'There might be a fight in a minute. This is my life!! Don’t want this but what can I do. Had enough. Sorry but this is what I have got to put up with and I hate it. This is my life. Sorry, but blokes. Want to f*** off anywhere but here'.

Mr Haggan told the jury of nine men and three women: 'At some point, this defendant picked up a kitchen knife and he used it to stab his brother.

'The defendant inflicted just one wound, but the tract of that wound was quite long, about 15 - 17 centimetres or approximately six or seven inches, and it punctured the aorta, the principle artery which runs down a person’s trunk.

In interviews, Robert Cerqua said his brother had been threatening him with the knife and he had either taken it, or picked up another, in a bid to defend himself.

The kitchen knife said to have been used - its handle broken and the blade bent - was discovered in the kitchen sink.

DNA found on the knife matched both the defendant and his brother because, as identical twins, they shared the same DNA profile.

In his first police interview on New Year's Day, Robert described his relationship with Christopher as 'fiery' and said drink could make him 'nasty' and 'short-tempered'.

He added: 'We started arguing, I do not know about what... All I can remember is he picked a knife up and walked towards me and I sort of panicked.

'I do not remember much. I punched him - I had a knife in my hand. He yelped and I ran out of the door.'

In a later interview he said he had not intended to kill his brother but had 'just reacted'.

Christopher Cerqua was described in tributes as 'thoughtful and caring', and had recently got back together with girlfriend Lisa Harfield, 40, a receptionist.

The couple had previously dated for six years and her son and three daughters described him as a ‘father figure’.
