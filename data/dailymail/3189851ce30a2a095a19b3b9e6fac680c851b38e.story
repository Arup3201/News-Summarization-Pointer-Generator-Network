They have been at his bedside every day for four months, waiting, hoping, praying.

Yesterday the family of cycle crash victim Ryan Smith – left in a coma after refusing to wear a helmet in case it messed up his hair – publicly shared the moment he woke up and gave them a hug.

The 16-year-old schoolboy athlete opened his eyes and uttered his first words in 123 anxious days: ‘Hello dad... hello mum.’

Magic moment: Ryan Smith, 16, who was knocked off his bike and left in a coma, hugs his father Mark, as he woke and spoke for the first time since July

Starting again: Ryan will now undergo six months of rehabilitation at The Children's Trust unit in Tadworth, Surrey

Recovering: Ryan Smith, 16, was knocked off his bike and severely injured - but had decided not to wear a helmet because he was worried it would spoil his fashionable hairstyle

Then he wrapped his arms around his father at the start of what will be a long rehabilitation programme that could one day see him walk out of hospital.

Earlier this year Mark Smith published a desperately poignant photo showing him cradling his son in his motionless, brain-damaged state.

It was meant to serve as a warning to other parents and teenagers on the danger of riding without a helmet. Yesterday the family released an equally moving snapshot, this time of the ‘miracle moment’ he awoke.

Star: Ryan's plight even touched Welsh footballer John Hartson, left, who travelled to Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire to offer his support

Emotional: Ryan holds the hand of his sister Rachael Smith, 21, who took the picture when her brother woke after four months

‘To go from being told he might not 
survive to holding him in my arms was something I will cherish for 
ever,’ the 44-year-old paramedic said. ‘It was the best hug I’ve ever 
had.’

Ryan, who represented 
his Lincolnshire school and county at athletics, spurned a cycle helmet 
because he didn’t want it to flatten his impressive mane of swept-back 
blond hair.

In July he was 
hit by a van, suffering a serious head injury. Since then he had 
remained unconscious, only recently showing signs of movement.

Vigil: Devoted dad Mark Smith has been by his teenage son's hospital bed every day since July and says the moment he left the coma was 'incredible' and was 'the best hug of my life'

Crash: Ryan didn't want to ruin his hair by putting on a helmet as he cycled to work and now his father is calling for all cyclist to wear them

Eye activity suggested he might be registering voices around him but Mark, and Ryan’s mother Julie, 46, could never be certain.

Until,
that is, he opened his eyes and spoke to them from his bed at Boston’s 
Pilgrim Hospital, close to his home in the seaside village of Chapel St 
Leonard’s.

His parents and their other children 
Rachael, 21, and Charlie May, five, had been chatting ceaselessly to 
him, including telling him he had passed all his GCSE exams, with an A* 
and three A-grades among them. Now it was his turn to talk.

‘I
asked him to say hello and he took a deep breath and said, “Hello”,’ 
said Mark. ‘After jumping around for ten minutes I composed myself and 
thought I’d push my luck and ask him to say dad.

He did. Then he went 
and said “Mum”.

‘I haven’t 
felt so happy for so long. Ryan has movement on his right side now, his 
vision is good, his hearing is fine.

He is showing true grit. But 
there’s a long way to go.’

Ryan
is starting six months of rehabilitation in a unit at The Children’s 
Trust in Tadworth, Surrey. His family is campaigning for a law forcing 
cyclists to wear helmets.
