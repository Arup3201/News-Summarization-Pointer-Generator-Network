The city of Sydney is known for its striking scenery, beautiful beaches and picturesque cityscape.

But in a new video shot by film production company Cavort, the city can be experienced from an entirely new perspective.

The camera dives in and out of the sails of the iconic Opera House, soars over Bondi Beach and weaves in between the pylons of the Anzac Bridge giving a distinct sense of flying.

The footage also takes viewers around St Mary's Cathedral, on a wild journey through Sydney's busy CBD and floats above a ferry against the backdrop of a spectacular sunset behind the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

The drone circles centrepoint tower, spins slowly above a cricket pitch and hovers above the coastline as waves crash onto the shore and surfers brave the waves.

Based in the lower east side of New York City, Cavort has created this series called 'Eye Spy' which aims to 'study and explore the world's cities from above and through light and structure.'

The Sydney City sequence was shot by Australian cinematographer Glenn Fowler, whose father Ian runs the Australian office of the production company.

From a technical standpoint, the film is a great achievement and provided some spectacular results.

Ian told Business Insider: 'The reason this looks so good is it has a highly skilled operator using it. If someone grabs one of those they could get one for about $700-$800; fully kitted out this one is worth about $2,500.

'But if someone just starts trying this stuff without the training they’re likely to crash it within five or 10 minutes.'

He also said when they were shooting scenes at Bondi Beach during summer, people were amazed and they have many enquiries about where they could get their own.

From the ground, Glenn was able to monitor the avionics and stream the footage he was shooting to ensure he's capturing all the right details.

Cavort have also shot aerial footage above New York City, San Diego, and an extensive adventure across the Caribbean.
