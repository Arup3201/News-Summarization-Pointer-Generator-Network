Syed Naveed Shabir, 31, has been jailed after stashing 1.6kgs of cocaine inside chessboards

An international drugs smuggler shipped more than £500,000-worth of heroin from Pakistan to Manchester by stashing it inside the lining of chessboards.

Syed Naveed Shabir, 31, concealed the drug so well that it could only be extracted when the fabric lining of the boards was ­dissolved with solvent.

But officers discovered the heroin - which was 100 per cent pure - after an undercover operation by the National Crime Agency.

Shabir has now been jailed for nine years after being found guilty at Manchester Crown Court of drugs smuggling.

The court was told how Shabir tried to smuggle 1.6kgs of the Class A drug by tucking it into the lining of ten games boards in a 'sophisticated concealment'.

The package, sent in September 2012, also included ludo boards and dried fruit.

But Shabir's covert operation was discovered when the package was spotted by the UK Border Force.

The court heard the parcel had been addressed to 'Mr S Ahmed' in Oldham, Greater Manchester.

Although the name was fake, the address used was real.

Once the package had been intercepted, a detective from the National Crime Agency posed as a Parcelforce delivery man so he could drop off the dummy delivery at the house.

The pure cocaine had to be extracted from the chess boards using a 
solvent process, after Shabir was caught by an undercover officer from the
 National Crime Agency

When there was no answer, he left a 'failure to deliver' card at the address with a phone number to call to rearrange the delivery.

The number led to a line which had been set up by the NCA for the operation.

Shabir's phone was used to call the number and another 'delivery time' was arranged.

This time, the parcel was signed for by another man, Khazar Hussain, who signed the sheet as 'Sataroz Ahmed'.

But Shabir's fingerprints were later found on the delivery note, the court was told.

Hussain was arrested in a nearby street but accused Shabir of setting him up. He was cleared of all charges at the trial.

Pete Avery, from the NCA's border policing command, said: 'This was a sophisticated concealment and demonstrates the lengths criminals go to in an effort to avoid detection.

'I have no doubt Shabir would have gone on to import large quantities of pure heroin, but joint work with the Border Force means he is now behind bars where he belongs.'
