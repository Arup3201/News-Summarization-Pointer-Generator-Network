A young couple and their two-year-old daughter have died after a wrong-way driver smashed into their car as they drove home from a day of Christmas shopping.

Paige Altman, 20, Cameron Greene, 22, and their daughter, Kyleigh Altman, were killed after William Ogletree, 32, hit their Honda Accord with his SUV on State Road 50 in Titusville, Florida on Sunday night.

Greene and Ogletree were pronounced dead at the scene, and Altman and her daughter both died of their injuries in hospital. The young family had all been wearing seatbelts, but Ogletree had not.

Authorities are still stumped over why Ogletree was driving the wrong way.

Tragic: Paige Altman, 20, and her two-year-old daughter, Kyleigh, both died in hospital after their Honda Accord was hit head-on by a wrong-way driver on Sunday. Kyleigh's dad was also killed in the crash

He had a valid, clean license, WFTV reported. Other drivers told the station that it is not uncommon for motorists to misread a nearby junction and end up driving the wrong way.

Alcohol tests are pending.

Orange County deputies received multiple calls about a wrong-way driver but he smashed into the Honda around 9pm before he could be reached by authorities.

'The three victims in the Honda are completely innocent in this,' Sergeant Kim Montes, a spokeswoman with the FHP, told the Orlando Sentinel.

Altman's family told the Sentinel that the couple had taken their daughter to Toys R Us for some holiday shopping before going to a Japanese steakhouse for dinner.

'She went nowhere without her daughter,' Paige's father Gary Altman told Local 6.

Altman was a certified nursing assistant who was studying to become a registered nurse and was planning on returning to Eastern Florida State College next semester, Local 6 reported. 

'She was very determined,' he said. 'She set her mind on something and she did it.'

She met Cameron while she was at Titusville High, her family said.

'She was kind and caring and generous,' her older sister Maegan Moaratty told Click Orlando. 'She would do anything for anybody.'

Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the crash and why Ogletree was going the wrong way.
