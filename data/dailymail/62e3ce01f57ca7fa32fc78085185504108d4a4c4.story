Police
 determined that Berkowitz had gotten out of Pagano's car and had begun 
walking home.

Newsday reports she exited the 2006 Jeep Liberty out of fear that Pagano was too drunk to drive.

She then began walking westbound on Nesconset Highway.

Police say Pagano tried to pull over to talk to Berkowitz 
but instead hit her with his vehicle.

At 4:11 a.m. 911 dispatchers received a call from Pagano reporting the accident and sent out first responders with reports of a serious head injury.

Berkowitz, of Stony Brook, was pronounced dead at the scene.

Pagano, of Coram, was arrested on a charge of driving while intoxicated.

It wasn't immediately clear if Pagano had an attorney.

He was held overnight at the Sixth Precint. An arraignment at First District Court in Central Islip was set for July 27, Long Island Exchange reports.

The incident remains under investigation. Anyone with information can call Crime Stoppers anonymously at 1-800-220-TIPS.
