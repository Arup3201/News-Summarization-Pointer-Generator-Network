With a net worth of £3billion, there are plenty of things Sir Richard Branson can buy with his money.

But his plans to explore the depths of the ocean have had to be put on hold, almost four years after the entrepreneur unveiled the Virgin Oceanic DeepFlight Challenger submarine in April 2011.

Sir Richard, 64, originally wanted the 18ft-long vessel to make its first voyage 36,000ft down to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench - the lowest known point on Earth - before 2012.

On hold: Sir Richard Branson unveiled the Virgin Oceanic DeepFlight Challenger submarine in April 2011

Around the world: After the 36,000ft Pacific dive, the plan was for the craft to move on to Atlantic's 28,000ft deep Puerto Rico trench, followed by Arctic, Indian and Southern ocean dives

But the idea - ‘the last great challenge for humans’, in his words - has been mothballed, two months after Virgin Galactic’s future was put in doubt after the craft crashed on a test flight.

After the Pacific dive, the plan was for the craft to move on to Atlantic's 28,000ft deep Puerto Rico trench, followed by Arctic, Indian and Southern ocean dives, reported The Sunday Telegraph.

Virgin Oceanic - which had launched under the promise of ‘five dives, five oceans, two years, one epic adventure’ - was said to have planned to charge ‘aquanauts’ up to £300,000 for the trip.

But the DeepFlight company told Telegraph reporters Robert Mendick and Dominic Nicholls that the submarine could only be used for one dive because of the huge pressure on its structure.

Tests found its cockpit showed signs of cracking under the simulated pressure of a 38,000ft depth.

And in a statement on Virgin group's website in August, when he admitted defeat for the moment, Sir Richard said: ‘We are still highly passionate about exploring the bottom of the ocean. 

Underwater: It was hoped by Sir Richard that his deep sea exploration would break as many as 30 Guinness World Records, including the five deepest dives in history

Down it goes: On his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea, Sir Richard was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine's tiny cockpit

‘However, we are now widening the focus of the project and looking for new technology to help us explore the ocean and democratise access at reduced cost and increased safety.’

Virgin then confirmed last week that the project had been ‘put on ice while we look at other technology that works’, adding that it was hopeful of reviving it at some point.

Virgin spokesman Nick Fox told MailOnline today: 'Richard is planning to develop a submarine technology that will reach the bottom of the ocean multiple times. In an ideal world this sub would take a pilot and two passengers.

‘We remain committed to the exploration of the deep seas but it will take time to find and develop the right robust technology to reach the bottom of the ocean with the same craft many times.’

It was thought the deep sea exploration could have broken as many as 30 Guinness World Records, including the five deepest dives in history.

On his planned journeys to the bottom of the sea, father-of-two Sir Richard was expecting to spend up to 12 hours in complete darkness and freezing cold in the submarine's tiny cockpit. 

Successful: Two years ago, Hollywood director James Cameron made it down to the Mariana Trench in a solo descent in the Deepsea Challenger submarine, taking more than two hours to reach the bottom

Fatal crash: Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart

The eight-foot long craft, made of carbon fibre and titanium, had stubby wings and a cockpit. It was said that it could cruise for about six miles and stay submerged without help for 24 hours.

Sir Richard had planned to take it in turns with US sailor Chris Welch to pilot the submarine. Mr Welch is carrying on with the project and Sir Richard has the option to do a dive with him.

Two years ago, Hollywood director James Cameron made it down to the Mariana Trench in a solo descent in the Deepsea Challenger submarine, taking more than two hours to reach the bottom.

That was only the second manned expedition to the depths - the first was in 1960 when US Navy Lt Don Walsh and Swiss oceanographer Jacques Piccard spent 20 minutes on the ocean floor.

In October, Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart.

Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system.
