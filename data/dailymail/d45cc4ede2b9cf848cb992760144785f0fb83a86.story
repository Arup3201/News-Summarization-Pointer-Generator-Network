Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Everton have failed to score in three of their last four Premier League matches against Southampton.

Everton have scored three own goals in their last two Premier League matches against Saints.

Southampton have won none of their last nine trips to Goodison Park in the Premier League (W0 D2 L7) and won just one of 15 away games against the Toffees overall (W1 D3 L11).

Everton’s record Premier League win came at home against Southampton in November 1996 (7-1), a result they matched v Sunderland in November 2007.

Roberto Martinez’s side have won just four of their last 15 Premier League games at Goodison Park (W4 D7 L4).

Ronald Koeman’s side have lost just one of their last six Premier League away matches (W4 D1 L1).

Graziano Pellè has not scored or assisted a goal in any of his last 13 Premier League appearances, despite attempting 34 shots (inc. blocked) and creating 12 goalscoring chances for his teammates in these games.

If Southampton win this match, they’ll equal their best ever points tally in a single Premier League season (56 in 2013-14).

Everton have won just eight of their 30 Premier League games this season, half the number that they won at this stage last season (16).

Southampton have dropped just two points from leading positions all season in the Premier League (W16 D1 of the 17 games they have led in) – fewer than any other side.
