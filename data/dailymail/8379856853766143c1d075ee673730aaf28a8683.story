Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has revealed Daniel Sturridge will be fit and available to face West Ham next Saturday, after seeing his side play out an FA Cup fourth round stalemate with Bolton at Anfield.

Sturridge, whose last appearance for the Reds came on August 31 after a series of thigh and calf injuries since, will train with the rest of the first-team squad on Sunday ahead of next weekend's home league clash against the high-flying Hammers.

Following the stalemate with Bolton Rodgers told BT Sport: 'Daniel trains with the team on Sunday – he’s at a real good level in terms of his fitness at the moment.

'He completed his final rehabilitation with the medical and sports science guys today, so he'll be ready for the West Ham game - whether he starts or not will depend closer to the time.

‘We’ll see if we can get him back for the Chelsea game in midweek too.' 

And despite seeing his side draw a blank against Championship opposition, Rodgers was equally positive about his side's performance against Neil Lennon's side.

He added: 'It was always going to be tough. Neil (Lennon) has done a great job there and in 16 games they've only lost three.

'We knew it would be physically demanding and I thought the players were outstanding positionally and getting the ball into the final third.

'You look at some of the other results around the country today and at least we're still in the competition.

'If you can't win the game it's important you don't lose it. With the players we've got coming back from injury too we're optimistic about our chances for the second half of the season.'
