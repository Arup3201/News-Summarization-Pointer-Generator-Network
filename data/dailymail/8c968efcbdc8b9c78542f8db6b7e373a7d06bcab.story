Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard touchingly swapped shirts with Stoke City teenager Oliver Shenton following their Premier League clash on Wednesday night after learning from Peter Crouch that the youngster had recently lost his mother to cancer.

Upon hearing the news from his former England team-mate, Lampard approached 17-year-old Shenton after Manchester City's 4-1 win at The Britannia and the pair agreed to swap shirts.

Lampard had to suffer the bereavement of his own mum Pat in 2008, a tragedy he later admitted left him 'in a daze' and almost unable to remember his performances at Chelsea that season.

Age: 17

Club: Stoke City 

Position: Midfielder 

From: Shenton hails from Blythe Bridge, five miles outside Stoke-on-Trent

Debut: Came on as a second-half substite in 3-0 Capital One Cup win over Portsmouth in August 2014 

History: Shenton's debut made him the third youngest player to ever appear for Stoke 

Time at Britannia: He has been with the Potters from seven years old

His gesture to help comfort a fellow professional going through the same ordeal is a welcome sign that the competitive and money-laden Premier League still retains a very human side.

Shenton made his league debut for Stoke as an injury-time substitute for Steven Nzonzi just two days after the funeral of his mum Mandy who recently lost a long fight against breast cancer.

It is believed manager Mark Hughes offered Shenton the chance to be part of Stoke's first-team squad to help cope with traumatic personal week and the youngster took the opportunity.

Crouch, who was part of the England squad alongside Lampard at the 2006 and 2010 World Cup, let his former team-mate know the special circumstances and typically the midfielder responded in a most sensitive and heartfelt manner.
