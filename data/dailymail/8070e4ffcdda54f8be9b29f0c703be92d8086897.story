Two care assistants were caught on camera beating and abusing frail dementia patients.

Sonia Limbu, 26, and Pargarsh Kaur Sahota, 57, were secretly filmed by a colleague hitting, pushing and shouting at elderly residents.

But yesterday they escaped jail after a judge denounced them as cruel – but decided that locking them up was not in the public interest.

The footage reveals Sahota hitting and shouting at a woman and Limbu whipping a man with a t-shirt.

Police described the abuse as 
despicable and commended whistleblower Slawomira Kowalkowska for 
bringing it to their attention. She handed police about 60 video clips 
she had made of the pair using a pen camera.

The home where they worked, Dormers 
Wells Lodge in Southall, West London, has already been criticised for 
the standards of care it provided.

A random inspection report on 
September, 24, 2010, by health watchdog the Care Quality Commission said
the 45-bed home in Telford Road was not meeting essential standards.

Some residents were locked in their 
bedrooms at night, which the report said did not 'respect their human 
rights' or 'protect them from abuse'.

The report found staff did not always 
help residents with meals in a respectful manner and said there were 
shortfalls in 'the promotion of privacy and dignity'.

Sahota and Limbu were arrested in November 2010 after a police inquiry at the home, which was registered in 1965.described the
women as scapegoats and called for the home to be shut down or 
overhauled.

Isleworth Crown Court heard they 
mistreated their victims – Ranbir Man, Frederick Bell, Arthur Layne, 
Matthew O'Leary, Elizabeth Flynn and Daniel O'Neal – between May and 
September 2010.

Judge Robin Johnson told the pair: 
'The fact that those in the care home are old and suffering from 
dementia does not mean they are not entitled to be treated with dignity.
Family members entrust care homes and those who work in them to look 
after vulnerable people, and you failed them miserably.

'Having said that, the home you found yourself in was undeniably very poorly run and the training you received was lamentable.

'I have no doubt you were chosen to 
work with very little review and because you were both prepared to carry
out difficult work for low wages.

'The manager was wholly unfit to manage the care home and has been suspended.

'That does not excuse you for what you did, which was unkind and cruel.

'But I conclude there is no public interest in sending you to prison and the best sentence is a community order.'

Limbu, of Southall, was convicted of 
three counts of ill-treatment under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, and 
must complete 150 hours of community service. Sahota, of Southall, 
denied five counts of the same charge and was convicted of four, and 
must complete 200 hours of community service.

Detective Chief Inspector Stuart Ryan,
of the Metropolitan Police, who was in charge of the inquiry, said: 
'The actions of these women was despicable. I would like to commend the 
actions of Miss Kowalkowska for bringing this appalling abuse to our 
attention.'

After the case, Mr O'Neal's family 
said they were disappointed the pair were not jailed. They
