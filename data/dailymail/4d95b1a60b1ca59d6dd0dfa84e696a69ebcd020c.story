The nail biting final at the Olympics Aquatics centre was almost too much for the beautiful blonde in the bleachers.

Ex Olympic swimmer and glamorous Royal Princess Charlene of Monaco was supporting South African swimmer and friend Chad le Clos in the men's 200m Butterfly race.

And as the results came in the South African couldn't hide her delight as le Clos was awarded gold, beating record holder Michael Phelps by just 0.2 seconds.

Charlene was joined by husband Prince Albert II who, like her, was dressed down for the event in Sratford in a casual polo shirt and chinos.

Later she joined the le Clos family for the medal ceremony, sharing hugs and tears with Chad's mother and emotional father Bert as the South African national anthem played out across the pool.

As a professional swimmer Charlene competed with the South African female team in the 2000 Sydney Games, but didn't secure a medal placing fifth in the women's 4 x 100 metre Medley.

It was also in 2000 that Charlene met
her now husband Prince Albert at a swimming event in Monaco, although 
they didn't marry until eleven years later in 2011.

She continued to swim professionally 
but retired from competitive swimming after she failed to qualify for the 2008 Olympic Games and what she 
thought would be her last championship.

The couple look relaxed and happy together despite rumours of depression earlier this summer

Princess Charlene and Prince Albert 
have been supporting the South African swimming team since arriving in 
London and have been spotted at several events.

On Friday the couple attended a 
glittering banquet at Buckingham Palace with Queen Elizabeth and 
dignitaries before heading over to the Olympic Park to take part in the 
Opening Ceremony.

On Tuesday they looked relaxed and happy in each others company at the swimming event.

In May reports surfaced that Charlene 
was depressed because she was unable to become pregnant and provide her 
husband with a legitimate heir.

She is said to have
struck a ‘deal’ with  the Monaco ruler to bear him a 
child after she apparently tried to flee before their wedding last summer.

Rumours of a rift and a ‘pregnancy pact’ erupted before the couple married in a lavish state wedding.

The 'runaway bride' was said to have 
fled to Nice airport two days before the wedding after discovering her 
husband-to-be had had a third love-child during their 
relationship and to have been coaxed back by brokering a deal with the 'playboy prince' that she 
provide him with a legitimate heir.
