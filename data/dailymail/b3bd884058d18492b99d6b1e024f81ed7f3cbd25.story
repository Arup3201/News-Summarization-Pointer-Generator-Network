The son of a best-selling author has been found washed up on a paradise beach in Thailand.

The body of Gilda O'Neill's son, Jeremy O'Neill, was found by beachgoers at Patong beach in Phuket in the early hours of the morning.

The 37-year-old had been studying Thai at Patong Language School, just a few hundred yards from the beach, and was seen washing himself in the sea just hours before his tragic death.

He was rushed to Patong Hospital where doctors confirmed he had sadly drowned.

Gilda O'Neill wrote Sunday Times bestsellers, My East End and Our Street.

The popular historian and novelist, whose writing focused on the ever-changing face of East London throughout the 20th Century, sadly passed away following a short illness in 2010.

Tributes have already flooded into Mr O'Neill who grew up in Brentwood, Essex, but moved to London in 2002 before travelling to Thailand more recently.

Friends and family paid tribute to 'an amazing man' on a JustGiving tribute page set up in his memory to raise funds for Great Ormond Street Hospital.

Jodie said: 'Jel was the most big-hearted, larger than life, craziest person I knew and when remembering him I will always smile :) sleep tight fella xxx.'

J Bucknole added: 'Donating to a great charity in memory of an amazing man.'

A
spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office confirmed Mr 
O'Neill's death following the tragic incident last month saying: 'We 
were notified of the death of a British national on May 21 and we are 
providing consular assistance at this sad time.'
