Rebecca Durkin, 19, will face trial for the murder of her mother after prosecutors rejected her guilty plea to the lesser charge of manslaughter

A teenager will face a murder trial after she admitted in court that she killed her mother - but refused to plead guilty to a murder charge.

Rebecca Durkin, 19, admitted to the manslaughter of her 55-year-old mother, Clancy Durkin, who was found dead inside the family home home in Southport, Merseyside on January 7.

A post-mortem examination found hospital worker Clancy had died from asphyxiation.

Police questioned the victim's daughter for  three days, but the full-time student repeatedly denied any involvement in her mother's death, the court was told.

Ms Durkin appeared in court via video link from HMP Styal and answered questions put to her by Judge Clement Goldstone QC.  

The teenager repeatedly denied, both during questioning and at an earlier appearance at Sefton Magistrates Court, that she was responsible for the death of her mother, the court heard.

But when asked her plea to the one count of manslaughter, she said: 'Guilty to manslaughter, yes.' 

Prosecutors immediately rejected her plea, and she will now face a murder trial from June 30 that's expected to last more than a week.

The prosecuting QC, Brian Cummings, told the court: 'The plea is not acceptable to the crown. We would like a jury to decide this.' 

Judge Goldstone told Ms Durkin she would remain in custody until her murder trial began.

'Your next appearance will be at this court on June 30 when your trial will take place. In the mean time you will remain in custody,' he said. 

Clancy Durkin, 55, - who was described by colleagues as 'a joy' - was found asphyxiated in her Merseyside home in January

Clancy Durkin had worked as a  caterer at the Southport and District General Hospital, where her colleagues remembered her as a 'lovely person' and a 'joy to work with'.

'I know I speak for all Clancy’s colleagues here when I say our thoughts are with her family and friends at this very difficult time,' the Hospital's site services manager, Lynne Shaw, told the Liverpool Echo.

'Clancy was a lovely person and a joy to work with. She was hard-working, and someone who looked after her colleagues and made everyone welcome.

'She will be sadly missed.' 

The trial continues.
