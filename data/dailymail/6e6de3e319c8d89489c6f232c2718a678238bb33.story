A tropical depression has formed off the coast of Florida and is expected to develop fairly quickly into the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, while in the Midwest, a deadly derecho has barreled through cities from Indiana to Iowa, killing at least one.

The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tropical Depression One formed Monday and had maximum sustained winds of about 35 mph (55 kph), with higher gusts. It was centered 105 miles (170 kms) east-southeast of Cape Canaveral and was moving southwest at about 2 mph (4 kph).

A tropical-storm watch was in effect Monday night for the east coast of Florida from Fort Pierce northward to just south of Flagler Beach.

The Hurricane Center said gradual strengthening was expected during the next 48 hours and that the depression is forecast to become a tropical storm by Tuesday.

In the Midwest, wind gusts reached over 80mph and caused damage to trees and houses in Iowa and Nebraska Monday.

The winds then moved to Chicago, where tornado and flood warnings were issued.

Iowa Governor Terry Branstad issued a disaster proclamation for Adair, Cedar, Guthrie, Jones and Linn counties.

The heavy rainfall is likely to diminish Tuesday but the runoff is expected to make several rivers swell, including the Mississippi.

Flood waters were expected to make 11 locks and dams impassable on the upper Mississippi River, forcing the closure of the river later on Monday from Bellevue, Iowa, to Saverton, Missouri, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers told The Associated Press.
