A woman who was raped by a stranger in an alleyway has waived her right to anonymity to share her harrowing story and give other victims the courage to report their attacks.

Juliet, who is in her forties, was attacked after leaving a bar in Manchester on New Year's Eve 2011. She was drunk at the time so did not remember the ordeal until the following morning when she had some frightening flashbacks and felt so sore it hurt to even sit down.

Juliet told the MailOnline her experience was 'most people's worst nightmare' and something she still struggles to deal with today - but she wanted to share her story in the hope it will give strength to other rape victims and change society's view on the taboo subject.

Brave: Juliet has shared her story in the hope it will encourage other victims of rape to seek justice

She said: 'Many victims of rape don't report it because they feel ashamed or experience self-blame. But no-one deserves to be raped.

'I had done nothing wrong, I had just gone out for a drink. It happened to me and it could happen to anyone, male or female.

'Victims need to come forward and report rape so a clear message is sent to rapists that they will not get away with it.'

With the support of the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre in Manchester, one of 46 specialist centres in the UK for rape victims, Juliet was able to see her attacker brought to justice.

A new BBC documentary, The Unspeakable Crime: Rape, that airs this evening, reveals the work the centre is doing to help people like Juliet.

In the footage, Juliet explains how she had gone out to celebrate on New Year's Eve after first drinking a bottle of wine at home. She had another drink and a shot and was expelled from the bar by the doorman as she appeared very 'out of it'.

She said: 'I remember feeling really out of it and going, "what the hell are you doing here, Juliet? Go home!" And then it's blank.

'My next memory, and I didn’t remember this until the next morning, and it’s in an alleyway... I don’tremember what's happened. Except the alleyway and then somebody holding me there and holding me and holding me.'

Juliet could recall elements of a sexual attack but her memory was sketchy. After reporting what she could remember to the police, CCTV footage, her injuries and a forensic examination helped piece together her horrific ordeal.

After examining Juliet, it was found she had injuries to her mouth consistent with forced oral sex. Other swabs taken from her found evidence she had also had sexual intercourse - something she had no recollection of.

After being told about what the doctors had found, Juliet was shocked she couldn't remember what had happened.

She said: 'I still don’t remember and I still can’t believe that it’s happened. I still want it to have not happened. I wish somebody would come and say, "Juliet, you got it all wrong". But I know that’s not going to happen.'

Juliet said learning to live with what had happened to her was difficult and she frequently suffered from anxiety attacks.

'You can't let it be you. And that's what I’ve really learnt. My identity
isn't 'I got raped'. I am Juliet. But I'm forever altered'

She said: 'I couldn’t even get to the shops without freaking out and running home. Because you feel stained. You feel contaminated. You feel like everything you touch is going to be soiled with what has happened to you.'

At first, Juliet also had to live with the fact her attacker was still at large - and she had no idea who he was and if he could strike again.

However using the DNA swabs that were
taken from her, Greater Manchester Police's serious sexual offences 
unit made a match with a 20-year-old male called Mustafa Yussuf.

In many rape cases, there is not 
enough evidence to prosecute. But thanks to the CCTV footage of Juliet 
leaving the bar looking drunk and stumbling from an alleyway some time 
later, the DNA evidence, and footage of Yussuf in the area on the same evening, he was charged.

He pleaded not guilty but after hearing all the evidence, a jury found him guilty of rape. He was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison and put on the sex offenders register.

Juliet said it was a relief to know her attacker would be jailed but it was a 'hollow victory' given he was given a short sentence while she has to live with what happened forever.

But she hopes her case gives other victims hope of some justice.

'I didn't even remember my attack but the guy was still convicted thanks to the forensic evidence,' she said.

Juliet's is one of thousands of rape cases that the St Mary's clinic deals with every year involving women, men and children.

But Dr Cath White from the clinic said Juliet's case was unusual in that 'stranger rapes in the alleyway are really quite rare.'

She added: 'The vast majority are people that are known, whether it's partner, ex partner, colleague. And that's in the adults. When you move into the children, particularly the younger you go with the children, the more likely it is to be somebody they know.'

Today, Juliet said she is still haunted by her experience and can suffer from flashbacks. She has moved away from Manchester and said she won't go into the city centre again because it makes her so anxious.

She added: 'I'm more reserved now and not as out-going as I used to be. But while I can't forget what happened, I have learned to live with it.

'You can't let it be you. And that’s what I’ve really learned. My identity
isn't "I got raped". It's not. I am Juliet. But I'm forever altered.

'I hope people who see my story on the documentary will see that I have survived - and I hope that will give them strength.'

The Unspeakable Crime: Rape will be on BBC One 10.35pm Tuesday, 4 June
