A man dubbed 'El Wingador' for his ability to eat a chicken wing in a split-second was indicted on charges of dealing cocaine yesterday.

As a five-time champion of Philadelphia's competitive chicken wing eating race - the Wing Bowl - William Simmons has became a legend in his South Jersey community and the gluttonous world of eating contests.

However, the married star is now facing altogether different notoriety after being formerly charged by a Gloucester County grand jury of possession and distribution of cocaine on Thursday.

The father-of-three, of Woodbury Heights, who last won the contest by eating 162 wings in 32 minutes, was indicted by a jury on 13 separate drug counts, the Philadelphia Inquirer reports.

The decision came on the eve of his beloved contest which marks the Friday before the Super Bowl and took place today. El Wingador was barred from entry.

He was first arrested in connection to the charges in June 2012 and after 10 days in jail was released on $100,000 bail.

Following his arrest the 51-year-old apologized to his fans for being 'a big dummy'.

'I know I'm not a bad person,' Simmons said, 'just a big dummy, and I'm asking not to be judged by this one thing.'

Following his time in jail he also released a statement condemning 'hard-time' for non-violent offenders.

'I got to see first hand the impact hard time for nonviolent offenders has on these young kids facing long sentences, giving them no chance at rehabilitation or of ever leading normal, productive lives,' he said. 

Simmons is charged with four counts of possession of a controlled dangerous substance and one count of manufacturing or distribution of more than a half ounce of cocaine.

He is also charged with six counts of manufacturing or distribution of more than a half ounce and less than five ounces of the drug and two counts of manufacturing less than half an ounce.

The Wing Bowl was held for the 21st time at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia this morning with a prize of $20,000 for the fastest eater.  

Founder Angelo Cataldi said Simmons would not be allowed to take part in this year's events.

'We all owe a debt to Bill for what he has done for our event,' Cataldi told the Philadelphia Daily News. 'But I think for his benefit that his role be downplayed while he's working things out with the courts.'

He apparently missed the 'biggest moment' in Wing Bowl's history, according to Cataldi, as New Eagles coach Chip Kelly dropped in to watch the competition.

El Wingador retired after become top of the pecking order in the 1999, 2001- 2003 and 2005 Wing Bowl contests.

He came back in 2011 but was beaten by a single wing consumed by Jonathan “Super” Squibb who managed to eat 255 wings across the 30 minute contest - worth around 25,000 calories.

In 2012 Simmons came third and was arrested six months later.

This year the contest was won by James 'The Bear' Macdonald in his second ever chicken wing eating contest.

He beat Squibb by five wings consuming a whopping 287 wings in half an hour.

According to the Inquirer the former champ aired his frustrations on Facebook today, even suggesting another return from retirement.

'As I sit here listening to Wing Bowl ... and I;m not having a very good 
day ... I can't help knowing that I still CAN COMPETE in Wing Bowl. 
Dealing with some crazy stuff in my life right now, but going to stay 
strong. Keep it in Philly! I have to say if 
New England wins, that will suck! It will make me think about coming out
of retirement to try to bring it back, if I'm able ... My wife will 
kill me ... lol,' he reportedly wrote.

El Wingador has previously thanked his fans for their support through his legal issues.

'People showed an awful lot of support for someone who’s just a chicken-wing guy,' he said.
