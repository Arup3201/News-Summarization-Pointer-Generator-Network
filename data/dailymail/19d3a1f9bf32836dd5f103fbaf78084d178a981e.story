This is the horrifying moment a deer careered into a road and smashed into a car's windshield as it tried to escape a pack of baying wild dogs.

The animal hit the screen of a car being driven by Artem Kourikov, 32, on a highway near Tomsk in Russia, before bouncing off into the road.

The animal then found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth apparently unscathed - thus escaping falling prey to the hungry pack.

This is the horrifying moment a deer careered into a road just before it smashed into a car's windshield as it tried to escape a pack of baying wild dogs

Mr Kourikov, who was travelling with his girlfriend Natalya Loukanova, 29, said: 'There was this sudden movement to the right, the undergrowth parted and this sudden shape appeared in front of my car.

'It was over in a split second - it was a deer which had landed on the glass.

'It smashed it completely.

'As quickly as it was on the car bonnet it was off again.

'It sort of bounced over the roof onto the road, found its feet and ran off into the undergrowth on the other side. It seemed unhurt, it was certainly able to put on a burst of speed.  

The terrified animal ran into the pathway of a car being driven by Artem Kourikov, 32, on a highway near Tomsk in Russia

With no time to stop or swerve Mr Kourikov had no choice but to hit the creature

The impact completely shattered the windscreen of the car - but miraculously Mr Artem Kourikov, his girlfriend Natalya Loukanova, and the deer, were all unscathed. The animal bounded off into the undergrowth - escaping the pack of hungry animals which had been chasing it

'The wild dogs that had been all up for the hunt and were slavering at the mouth seemed to have lost interest.

'I guess they thought they had their prey in their sights and then it was gone. The traffic going up and down the highway put them off the chase.

'They sniffed the air for a bit, barked a little bit, and then turned around and headed back the way they had come. So if nothing else, our impromptu meeting with the deer saved it from the dogs.'

An estimated 1,500 people across Russia die in accidents involving deer or moose every year.

Last week a bus collided with a moose on a busy road in neighbouring Ukraine with the creature's antler's smashing through the wind shield and becoming embedded in the driver's cockpit.
