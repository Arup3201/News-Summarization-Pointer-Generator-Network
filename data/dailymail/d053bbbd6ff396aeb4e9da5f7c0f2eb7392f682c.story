Actress: Nappies and cots are bad for babies, while tampons can make you infertile, according to a motherhood manual by Alicia Silverstone

Nappies and cots are bad for babies, according to the latest celebrity motherhood manual. 

Written by actress Alicia Silverstone, the teen queen of the '90s who shot to fame in the hit 1995 romantic comedy Clueless, the book details bizarre parenting techniques that have been heavily criticised by experts. 

Among the offerings in The Kind Mama: A Simple Guide to Supercharged Fertility, a Radiant Pregnancy, a Sweeter Birth and a Healthier, More Beautiful Beginning are a recipe for a placenta smoothie and claims that tampons cause infertility because of the ‘potential pesticide residues from non-organic cotton’.

Miss Silverstone also says that parents who force their children to sleep in a cot rather than  the family bed are guilty of neglect, and describes nappies as ‘pseudoscience’.

And she declares she does not believe in 
vaccinating babies because of friends whose children were ‘never the 
same’ after receiving their jabs.

The book is based on her experience of bringing up her son Bear Blu, now two.

In it, the actress recommends a vegan 
diet to stop meat, dairy, and processed foods tracking ‘toxic sludge’ 
through your uterus.

She also claims the diet will ‘help prevent or 
cure’ a whole host of problems including ‘PMS, insomnia, allergies, 
breakouts, weight struggles, thyroid condition, lupus [and] multiple 
sclerosis - while significantly lowering your risk of heart disease, 
diabetes and cancer’.

Miss Silverstone’s unusual approach 
to parenting first came to light two years ago when she uploaded a video
 of herself chewing her baby’s food before feeding him from her own 
mouth, like a mother with a baby bird.

But critics have dismissed her advice. In an article on the BabyCenter website, writer Carolyn Robertson said: ‘I don’t doubt the importance of eating well, be it during pregnancy, postpartum or just in general, and I’m sure Alicia has insight into the vegan lifestyle.

‘But... she shows a profound lack of 
understanding, and perhaps even empathy, for mums who truly struggle to 
conceive, to birth, to breastfeed, and to adjust to motherhood.

'Alicia’s breezy prescription, which basically amounts to "stop stressing and eat plants", seems to seriously underestimate the reality of these struggles.’

Readers have also left critical reviews on the Amazon website. One reader wrote: ‘This book is filled with anti-science claims. Much of what it contains flies directly in the face of the evidence, and the author also goes so far as to make anti-vaccine claims. Children die as a result of not having been vaccinated. Please, publishers; stop printing this dangerous tripe.’ 

Another wrote: ‘I think it’s safe to say that if you’re looking for grown up, sensible, wise advice on fertility and mothering, look elsewhere.’
