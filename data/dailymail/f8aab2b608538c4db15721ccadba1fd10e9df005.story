A Somerville school teacher has been charged with having a sexual relationship with a 13-year-old student.

Alexandra Romanos, a fifth-grade teacher at East Somerville Community School, has been held on $50,000 bail after pleading not guilty yesterday to two counts of aggravated rape of a child and three counts of indecent assault and battery on a child.

Police were tipped off to the alleged assaults in late June by the victim's mother after she became aware of inappropriate electronic messages between the two.

An investigation found the teacher allegedly initiated a sexual relationship with the child in late March, myfoxboston.com has reported.

Authorities say the alleged assaults took place both on and off school grounds.

Romanos has been placed on administrative leave and barred from the school.

If she makes bail, she is not allowed to contact the victim or the victim's family and cannot have unsupervised contact with children under 16.

She will also have to stay away from the Somerville School system, wear a GPS device and remain under house arrest.

In a statement released yesterday, Somerville Public Schools said: 'Nothing we can say will soften the impact that such news has on a community, particularly one as dedicated to nurturing and supporting our youth as Somerville.

'We are repulsed and angry that someone who made an oath to uphold the highest moral standards in the execution of her responsibilities as a teacher and a role model has allegedly blatantly violated that trust.'

According to CBS Boston, Romanos has worked at the school for seven years.
