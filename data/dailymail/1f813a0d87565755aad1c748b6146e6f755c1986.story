Go on Santa, treat yourself. Give the reindeer a break because Mercedes-Benz may have just the perfect present carrying answer — and in festive red to boot.

The company's new aerodynamically stylish CLA Shooting Brake, was unveiled at the Los Angeles motor show just in time to make its way onto Christmas wish lists.

Over here you'll have to wait for the spring for this sleek mini-estate as UK order books open in January for March deliveries.

Expect prices from around £25,500 to about £43,000 for the pumped-up CLA45 AMG

Expect prices from around £25,500 to about £43,000 for the pumped-up CLA45 AMG, which will accelerate from rest to 62mph in 4.7 seconds, thanks to its 360 bhp, 2-litre turbo engine — the world's most powerful four-cylinder engine in series production.

Mondeo Man is having the last laugh as the latest incarnation of Ford's family car will depreciate less than a BMW, Audi or Volkswagen, say independent motor trade experts at CAP Automotive.

According to its Gold Book, a diesel Mondeo 2.0 TDCi ECOnetic Zetec will hold onto 42.7 per cent of its new list price after three years and 30,000 miles. That compares with 38.3 per cent for a diesel Audi A4 2.0 TDIe SE, 36.8 per cent for a BMW 3 Series 318d SE and 41.6 per cent for a VW Passat 2.0 TDI Bluemotion Tech Executive.

And at three years, with 60,000 miles on the clock, a petrol Mondeo 1.5 EcoBoost Zetec will be worth 36.1 per cent of its list price, beating an Audi A4 1.8T FSI 170 SE, a BMW 320i SE's and a VW Passat 1.4 TSI 160 Executive. The book also expects the new Mondeo to be worth £1,750 more after three years than the previous model was at the same age.

There's a fascinating, if jawdropping and wince-making, TV series at the moment looking at the culture, attitudes and language used on TV in the Seventies. Did they really say and wear things like that? They surely did.

I was reminded of this when BMW boss Tim Abbott, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), spoke at its annual dinner this week.

Explaining how production is now on track for levels not seen since the Seventies, he said: 'Production is — despite the uncertainties — still forecast to rise to around two million by 2017, last achieved in 1972. But it needs a strong European market.' He noted: 'For those of you who, like me, can remember 1972, the transformation of our industry — in products, technology, labour relations and management — has been remarkable.

'In 1972, children used to rattle around in the back of cars like nuts in a can. You couldn't see where you were going because of all the cigarette smoke and your flared trousers would be caught on the brake pedal.' Quite.

Remember that infectiously catchy — if slightly irritating — Korean song that dominated the charts a few years back? Gangnam Style, by PSY, took its name from the trendy, upmarket Gangnam district of South Korea's capital, Seoul — its version of Kensington and Chelsea in West London.

Gangnam is also the place where car-maker SsangYong — Korean for 'two dragons' — has its headquarters. And in the New Year it's hoping to emulate PSY's success with the launch of a new sports utility vehicle.

The five-door Tivoli is pitched to take on the quirky Nissan Juke. It will be launched in Korea in January before a European debut at the Geneva motor show and will arrive here next summer.

Expect prices from around £13,500 and the option of either a 1.6 litre petrol or a 1.6 litre diesel engine.

As well as offering lots of interior seating and storage space, it aims to offer driver and passengers easy IT connectivity.

SssangYong's UK sales and marketing director Steve Gray expects it to double the firm's annual UK sales from 2,000 to 4,000 a year.

There's also a five-year unlimited mileage warranty.

FACING FORWARD IS A STEP BACKWARD IN CHILD SAFETY 

Millions of parents could be risking their child's safety because of confusion over car seats, says new research

Millions of parents could be risking their child's safety because of confusion over car seats, says new research.

Seventy-four per cent of parents with children under four said they use a front-facing seat. But this puts them at up to five times greater risk of death or serious injury than if they were seated facing the rear of the car, says a report for Volvo Car UK.

It says: 'In the UK, official guidance is to keep children in a rear-facing seat until they are 13kg (around nine months). However, in Sweden the norm is to postpone the change until up to age four.

'In Sweden, not a single child under six died in a car in 2013 and there were just ten serious injuries among child passengers under six.

'Over the same period in the UK, there were 77 deaths and serious injuries among occupants under four — more than one a week.'
