He is a future king and member of one of the most famous families on the planet.

But the youth of Sunderland weren’t overly impressed when Prince William arrived in the city on an official visit today.

‘Is he the ginger one or the one with the bairn?' enquired one.

Thankfully, the royal soon won new fans as he enthusiastically joined in with a cookery class and conducted a brief walkabout.

Just who is this mystery man putting on an apron in Sunderland today...?

The Duke of Cambridge helped with a cookery lesson at the Centrepoint support centre for the homeless in Tyne and Wear

The prince was conducting a series of engagements in the North East, starting with a visit to the Dundas Street Centrepoint hostel, the charity's first purpose-built accommodation for homeless young people. He's seen here helping to prepare a chicken and vegetable curry

The Duke of Cambridge is the patron of the Centrepoint homeless charity. A learning officer who met William along with a group of young people from Centrepoint and the Prince's Trust revealed that some of the young people did not know who he was

Learning officer Alison York said: 'A lot of the young people don't know much about the royal family and which prince is which. I was asked, "Is he the ginger one?" Or the "one with the bairn?"' Above, Prince Harry

The prince was conducting a series of engagements in the North East, starting with a visit to the Dundas Street Centrepoint hostel, the charity’s first purpose-built accommodation for homeless young people.

Jennifer Sams, 19, who was homeless for two and a half years, helped him to cook a chicken and vegetable curry.

‘He was so down to earth you wouldn't think he was royalty,’ she said.

She also revealed he chatted about his new son, Prince George, adding: ‘He was saying he had been holding him and his baby had been smiling into the mirror.’

Prince William also chatted and joked with wellwishers at the Haven Point Leisure Centre in South Shields

The second in line to the throne was clearly in his element as he entertained the young flag-waving crowd

'That knowledge is not there necessarily. It's been fantastic in that way to show who he is and what he does for the service,’ she said.

‘I was asked, "Is he the ginger one?" Or the "one with the bairn?"' (Bairn being a northern English term for a child.)

‘It’s natural with all the things going on in their lives, it's not in the forefront of their lives or their priorities [but] he was very interested  in what we do with young people. He was just fantastic at putting everyone at their ease. ‘

His visit was part of a day in which he learned how an alliance of bodies was teaming up to tackle the issue of homelessness.

 

The prince joined in with the Parachute Game at the Diana Award Inspire Day at Haven Point Leisure Centre

William met 30 youngsters, mostly teenagers, taking part in a workshop at the centre, which focuses on training young people to take a stand against bullying, learn project management skills, and help others to improve their chances of getting work

Seven charities, including Centrepoint - of which he has been patron since 2005 - and his father's Prince's Trust, are making up the End Youth Homelessness campaign

Centrepoint’s Chief executive Seyi Obakin said: ‘When young people come to Centrepoint, they feel that the world in general has abandoned them, that authority has abandoned them.

‘So for these young people, when someone as senior as the Duke of Cambridge comes along and shows interest, that has a really powerful motivation and says to them "you guys matter, your lives matter" and gives the young people aspiration.

The Duke also chatted with pupils from the St Joseph's Catholic Academy

'When he comes, he fires up the aspirations in the young people and we have something to work with.

‘He is coming because he was particularly keen to get the message across that we have to help these young people, we have to tackle these problems.

‘He first threw out the challenge that we should just not accept youth homelessness and he is very pleased we are starting to work on that.’

Among those he met was Wade Tench, 20. 

Tench called the Dundas Street centre a ‘home from home’ that had given him life skills.

‘I can't thank this place enough,’ he told William.

Later the prince marked his late mother's memory by paying tribute to Britain's one remaining charity that carries her name.

The second in line to the throne visited a workshop for young people involved in the Diana Award, the national youth scheme set up to perpetuate her legacy.

On a visit to South Shields, Tyneside, he met some of the 40,000 young people who have received the award for improving the lives of others since 1999 and asked if it made it more special to them that their awards included her name.

He looked delighted when they told him ‘yes’ and said: ‘You are the only charity that carries my mother's name. That is really special.’

William met 30 youngsters, mostly teenagers, taking part in a workshop at the Haven Point Leisure Centre in South Shields focusing on training young people to take a stand against bullying, learn project management skills, and help others to improve their chances of getting work.

Among them was Bright Samuel, 15, from Woolwich, London, an aspiring footballer who has suffered pressure from youth gangs.

Bright, who is receiving mentoring from Diana Award holder Alex Farrow, 24, told William how he had just been for a trial with Norwich City but after suffering rejection is going for another trial with Charlton tomorrow.

'What, not Aston Villa?' said William, a keen supporter of the Premier League side.

'He told me I should get signed with a club and then eventually sign for Aston Villa and play at right back because they need a good right back,' said Bright, who currently plays in midfield.

William was also moved by Tyreese Garrod, 12, a Diana Award anti-bullying ambassador from Newham, London, who decided to take a stand after his cousin, Nathan Jones, 12, killed himself as a result of severe bullying.

The prince looked flushed as he listened to Tyreese performing a rap urging children to stand up against bullying.

'Good rap,' said William, who signed a Facebook Wall of anti-bullying messages and wrote: 'Be Strong!'

Earlier, the prince had unveiled a plaque to mark the official opening of the leisure centre after meeting swimmers.

On his way to the Diana Award workshop in the centre, he walked past the gym upstairs and gestured through the windows at bodybuilders, urging them to work harder on their bench presses and chest exercises.
