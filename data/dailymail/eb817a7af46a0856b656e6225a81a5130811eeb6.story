A 16-year-old Mexican girl allegedly murdered her 'best friend' in a horrific stabbing attack after she posted naked photos of the pair to her Facebook account.

Anel Baez, also 16, was found with 65 stab wounds to her neck on March 19 after she invited Erandy Elizabeth Gutierrez - a girl she referred to as her 'sister' - to her home in an attempt at reconciliation.

The two - who both lived in Guamúchil in western Mexico - had fallen out after Anel published revealing photos on her Facebook account, according to Mexican news website Notus.

Erandy arrived and asked her unsuspecting friend if she could use the toilet.

She instead went to the kitchen, grabbed a knife and allegedly stabbed Anel over and over again, leaving her in a pool of blood.

She then fled the scene and tried to cover her tracks by grieving with friends of the pair and attended Anel's funeral a few days later.

It is there that police eventually arrested her.

Earlier in the year Erandy took to Twitter to send chilling threats to her once best friend.

'It may seem that I am very calm, but in my head I have killed you at least three times,' she wrote on an account that has since been deleted.

Anel was also told she would be 'lucky to survive until the end of the year'.

Her Facebook page - which is yet to be taken down - reveals a tragic look inside the lives of two young pals who would one day become victim and alleged murderer.

A photo of the pair posted on October 15 2012 - which has since been liked nearly 3,500 times - shows the two girls smiling for the camera above a heartfelt message written from Anel to the girl who would one day make good on vicious and violent death threats.

Translated roughly from Spanish, the message reads: 'I love you...you are my beloved sister...thanks for those moments of madness that provoke me and the laughter that you give me and also the desire to do crazy things with you'.

The young One Direction and Twilight fan lived in Guamúchil in the Sinaloa region of western Mexico.

Since her brutal murder, Anel's local high school (which was also attended by Erandy) has been hosting lectures and seminars aimed at preventing further similar tragedies, local media reports.

News website Cafe Negro says the 'therapy' sessions are being run by rector Juan Eulogio War Liera for a community left 'sad and outraged' by the brutal murder.

'In this community I want to tell you are not alone, we share your pain and anger and can add efforts to overcome the bitter moment,' the website quotes him as saying.

'Unity in the family is a way to preserve peace, values​​, tranquility and have a better world.'

It is expected police will lay murder charges in the coming days. Under Mexican law, Erandy faces a maximum of seven years in prison if found guilty.
