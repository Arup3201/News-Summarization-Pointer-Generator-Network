Paula Thorne, pictured with Satchmo, was left distraught after a courier ran over and killer her dog while delivering Christmas presents to their home

A Family was left distraught after a courier ran over and killed their dog while delivering Christmas presents to their home.

The delivery man struck the cocker spaniel as he came down the drive, sending the beloved pet ‘flying’ and breaking his pelvis in six places.

The injuries meant Satchmo – who had been in the family for nearly 13 years – had to be put down. But when owner Paula Thorne contacted the Hermes courier service, they simply apologised ‘for the inconvenience’ and closed the complaint.

And to make matters worse, Mrs Thorne now believes she has been ‘blacklisted’ by the company after a second package she ordered was sent back to the seller.

‘My husband was in the yard when he heard a car coming down the drive,’ she said. ‘Thinking it was me, he came out but realised that the car was going much faster than I ever would.’

Satchmo then ran out to meet the vehicle – however the driver apparently did not see the dog, who had a black coat, as he approached in the dark.

‘My husband saw the car swerve round the corner and then straight into Satchmo.

‘The car sent Satchmo flying. The courier, who is a regular, got out and said sorry, but my husband said to him: “Do you realise you’ve killed my dog?” The courier apologised but my husband said: “What do you expect when you drive like that?”’

She added that there is a sign warning people to drive slowly on the approach to their family farm in Newark, Nottinghamshire.

Her husband Ian, 70, ran to get a blanket for the injured animal, who whimpered as he lay on the ground. The vet later confirmed that his pelvis was broken in five or six places, and he had to be put down to end his suffering.

Mrs Thorne, who has three grown-up children and works in NHS mental health services, said the family was in shock and that the tragic incident on December 15 had ruined Christmas. ‘I was away in London at the time visiting my daughter and my husband phoned to say he had sad news and told us what had happened,’ she said.

‘We were in a daze. We collected his body and buried him in the woods. We were in shock but the more I thought about it, the more I realised that someone would have to take responsibility.’ She called the company with whom she had made the initial order – a pair of slippers from Samuel Windsor. But the firm said that she would have to get in touch with Hermes.

The grandmother-of-six then wrote to the courier service describing how her family had been left ‘grief-stricken’ by Satchmo’s death. ‘Understandably we are in the deep throes of bereavement – our Christmas has been destroyed – the pain is beyond measure,’ she said.

‘And my husband is suffering the acute loss of his shadow Satchmo. We hold Hermes responsible for the horrific death of our beloved dog of 13 years.’

She also complained to Hermes about the fact that a second delivery had been sent back to Next, the company she had ordered it from. The package included Christmas presents for the family of her son, the former Olympic sprinter Du’aine Ladejo, 43, who now lives in Australia. But they failed to arrive in time after the delivery was cancelled.

A spokesman for Hermes said the company was in contact with the Thornes and had apologised. ‘We would like to send our sincere condolences to this family for their terrible loss,’ he said.

He added that the firm had investigated the incident which led to Satchmo’s death, concluding that it was a ‘very sad accident’. ‘The courier contacted us immediately after he had explained to the customer what had happened. He was extremely upset, particularly as he too is a dog owner,’ he said.

‘He explained that he was driving slowly, around 20mph, but the lane was dark and he didn’t see the dog.’ The firm has also offered to help with any vet bills.
