A Maryland mother has been charged with child neglect, accused of leaving her two young daughters in a cold car while she had her makeup done in a mall department store.

Regina Marie Coleman, 28, was arrested after Charles County deputies were called to the St Charles Towne Center Tuesday evening by someone who heard children crying in a car outside.

Police say officers found two little girls, aged three and six, alone inside the Cadillac Escalade at about 8pm.

Made up: Officers say Coleman lied about having been in the mall for only 10 minutes and that she had in fact been inside for 90 minutes getting her make-up done while her children were outside in the car

The girls were dressed in heavy coats, but told officers they were cold. Officers put the children in a patrol car.

Authorities say the outdoor temperature was 16 degrees that night.

Officers then went inside to try and find the girls' parents.

Mall security paged the girls' mother, who met with deputies at the car.

Coleman told officers that she had 
only been inside the mall for about 10 minutes, where she'd returned 
without the children to find a wallet that she'd misplaced.

Cold night: The car was parked outside the St Charles Towne Center while Coleman was pampered

According to WJLA, deputies noted inconsistencies in her story and checked her bag, finding her wallet was inside it.

Deputies say Coleman had actually been in the store more than 90 minutes getting her makeup done.

She was arrested and charged with child neglect.

Online court records do not list an attorney for Coleman. Her daughters were turned over to relatives.
