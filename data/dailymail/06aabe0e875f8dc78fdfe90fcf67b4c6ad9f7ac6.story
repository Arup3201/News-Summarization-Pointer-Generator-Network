Tragic: Ronni Chasen, 64, was shot dead in her car as she drove home through Beverly Hills

A glamorous Hollywood publicist who was gunned down as she drove home from a movie premiere died from a shot to the heart, her autopsy has revealed.

Ronni Chasen, 64, was driving home from a showing of Burlesque when her Mercedes-Benz came under attack on Sunset Boulevard by a gunman with a stolen policeman's pistol on November 16.

She was hit four times, the report said, including 'the most rapidly fatal' shot, which pierced her heart, then passed through the right-side pulmonary vein and the right lung. A toxicology test found no signs of alcohol or drugs in her system.

The main suspect in the case, Harold Smith, committed suicide in the 
lobby of a Hollywood apartment building when police approached him more 
than three weeks after the slaying to question him.

Initially, rumours swirled around Hollywood that Ms Chasen had been targeted in a professional hit.

But police later claimed the crime scene was consistent with an attempted robbery or road rage. Ms Chasen’s car was found with its window cracked open a few inches.

Police believe that Smith, a 43-year-old ex-convict, shot Ms Chasen. He shot himself dead on December 1 in a Santa Monica apartment building after being confronted by officers.

The report revealed that the gun, 
which was used in both shootings, was a revolver stolen from a police 
officer during a burglary in the San Fernando Valley.

Final hours: The evening before her brutal murder, Chasen, far right, arrived on the red carpet at the Burlesque premiere to support a client

Smash: Chasen was still breathing immediately after the crash, according to the first witnesses to reach her

Removed: Ms Chasen's damaged Mercedes Benz was towed away from Sunset Boulevard

Suspect: Harold Smith had been convicted for weapons and drugs charges

It is unclear what department that officer works for and when the weapon was stolen.

The investigation concluded that it was unlikely that Ms Chasen had been killed in a professional hit.

It
said that a professional would likely have used a more powerful weapon 
and the hit would have been in a more remote location.

The gunman also hit Ms Chasen in the shoulder and chest, rather than in a tight pattern.

Ms Chasen received no death threats, was involved in no legal battles and seemed to live a ‘normal life’.

The veteran publicist was driving her Mercedes Benz just after midnight on November 16 when she was shot in the chest, leading her car to smash into a light pole.

Ms Chasen had just attended the premiere and after-party for the new movie starring Cher and Christina Aguilera.

She lived in Westwood, some 10 miles away, and may have been driving home when the attack occurred.

The publicist ran her own public relations and marketing firm, Chasen & Co and was well known in the industry.

She had worked as a publicist since 1973 with high-profile films on her resume like 1989's Driving Miss Daisy and 1994's Lolita.

She also did work for the Cocoon and Rocky franchises as well as Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.

She was named senior vice president of worldwide publicity at MGM in 1993.

MGM
executive Ashley Boone called Ms Chasen, 'One of the most respected 
publicity executives in the business' with 'strength and expertise in 
developing, positioning and executing productive motion picture 
campaigns'.
