With the return of Sherlock Holmes from the dead and a dramatic festive episode from Coronation Street, last year’s television on New Year’s Day was always going to be hard to beat.

But this Thursday’s bank holiday schedule of soap operas, sitcoms and old films managed it, attracting an extra 5million viewers on top of last year’s ratings.

A comparison of the top five shows from both years reveals the number of viewers rose from 30million on January 1, 2014, to 35million this year.

Figures showed Thursday's schedule of soap operas, sitcoms and old films saw viewers drop from 41million on January 1, 2014, to just 35million this year

An hour-long EastEnders special was Thursday’s most watched programme, with 8.5million switching on, beating the 6.8million who tuned in to Sherlock last year.

Coronation Street, the second most watched show of last New Year’s Day, did not have a January 1 episode this year. BBC1 claimed four of the top five spots on Thursday – up from three last year – with Mrs Brown’s Boys, the final episode of Miranda and an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s Esio Trot all joining EastEnders.

Fifth place was taken by ITV’s Emmerdale, with 4.9million viewers seeing character Lachlan White suffer a health scare after taking a legal high. The audience was smaller than that for last year’s offering from the soap, which was watched by 5.3million and came fourth in the list of most watched programmes.

EastEnders topped the charts with a dramatic episode that saw Lucy Beale’s killer confronted, a car crash leave one person dead and Ronnie go into labour on her wedding day. It also outperformed its episode from New Year’s Day 2014, attracting an extra 2.5million viewers. Last year, the soap had 6million people tune in, placing it third, after Sherlock and Coronation Street.

The Miranda finale was enjoyed by 7.3 million - beating the 6.7 million who watched the Christmas Day episode

In Miranda’s finale, the character’s long-awaited wedding to Gary was enjoyed by 7.3million – beating the 6.7million who watched the Christmas Day episode.

Esio Trot, based on Roald Dahl’s children’s book of the same name, was the only offering in the top five not to be part of an established series. It had 6.5million viewers.

Starring Oscar winners Dame Judi Dench and Dustin Hoffman, the programme received rave reviews on Twitter. But while Dame Judi’s performance was called ‘legendary’ and Hoffman’s ‘perfect’, social media users were scathing of James Corden’s narration.

Viewers branded The Wrong Mans star ‘awful’ and accused him of ‘ruining’ the show. One even suggested Dahl would be ‘spinning in his grave’.
