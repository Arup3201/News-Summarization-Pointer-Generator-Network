Rebekah Brooks yesterday denied waiting around for years like ‘Miss Havisham’ for her lover Andy Coulson to make a commitment to her.

The former News of the World editor, 45, admitted ‘confiding’ in Coulson when a story appeared in the tabloid in 2002 about murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler’s voicemail messages, which later caused a public outcry forcing the closure of the paper.

Their on-off relationship, which began in 1998, had several periods of ‘physical intimacy’ until 2004, when Brooks and Coulson were working as editor and deputy editor respectively, the Old Bailey heard.

When Coulson tried to break it off in February 2004, Brooks wrote an anguished love letter found on her computer which said: ‘For six years, I waited’.

But yesterday she said their relationship did not last for six years – and denied waiting like the spinster Miss Havisham in the Dickens novel Great Expectations.

She said: ‘ I didn’t have an affair for six years - if it was true I would say.

‘I think at the time when I am going back to when we were first together, that was in 1998 which is six years, at that moment at night when I wrote it, that’s what I felt. It was the emotion of the moment.

‘At that time, I had got back together with Ross [Kemp, Brooks’ then-husband], got married, bought a house together and tried for a baby.

‘My marriage had gone wrong again, but Andy Coulson had already got on with his life.

‘I’m clearly saying it’s been six years since we first got together, in my heart at that moment felt it I had waited.

‘Of course, I hadn’t been sitting there waiting like Miss Havisham.’

Brooks and Coulson deny phone hacking and misconduct in public office. She also denies perverting the course of justice.

The Old Bailey heard that the couple shared their inner-most thoughts and secrets, from their personal and professional lives.

Their relationship, which began in 1998, had several periods of ‘physical intimacy’ until 2004, jurors have heard.

It came at the height of a phone hacking conspiracy, when Brooks and Coulson, now both 45, were working as editor and deputy editor respectively.

She said of the tender letter, penned when she was married to Kemp: ‘The emotions I felt I had to Andy had obviously come out in this letter.

‘We didn’t have an affair for six years, but we were close, good friends.’

Yesterday Brooks was asked whether she was talking to Coulson ‘in that confidential way’ in April 2002, when the pair are accused of knowing Milly Dowler’s phone had been hacked by the tabloid.

Barely audible to the court, Brooks whispered: ‘Yes.’
