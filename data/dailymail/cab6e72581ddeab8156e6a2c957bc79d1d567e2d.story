Only one in three people routinely see police officers patrolling their neighbourhood, a new report has revealed.

Critics said the shocking statistics sounded the death knell for the traditional Dixon Of Dock Green-style beat bobby pounding Britain’s streets.

Police chiefs warned the fall in police visibility would get worse if threatened major budget cuts are pushed through after the general election.

But Home Secretary Theresa May has argued that since the Coalition’s austerity drive began in 2010, crime has tumbled – showing police forces have successfully continued to crack offending despite being ordered to make savings.

Decline: Just 32 per cent of people saw a police foot patrol at least once a week in 2013-14

The research, published by the Office For National Statistics yesterday also found one in five people think it is ‘likely’ they will become a victim of crime over the next 12 months amid concerns over community safety.

The most damning finding was the dwindling number of police officers or police community support officers (PCSOs) seen on foot patrols since the Coalition came to power.

Experts say not only does neighbourhood policing help catch criminals, it also deters offending, makes the public feel safe and strengthens links between the police and communities.

But only 32 per cent of people saw bobbies on the beat at least once a week in 2013-14, compared to 40 per cent in 2010-11.

And while the proportion who saw officers on foot once a month rose from 34 per cent to 40 per cent, the number never seeing them at all rose from 25 per cent to 28 per cent.

The figures coincide with a fall in the number of police officers and PCSOs from 161,000 to around 140,000 since ministers began their austerity drive.

Fear: One in five people said they thought it 'likely' they would be a victim of crime in the next year - a feeling at odds with Home Secretary Theresa May's assertion that crime has dropped since the cuts came in

There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police. Constabularies are also bracing themselves for further cuts amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds after the election.

David Green, criminologist and founder of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘Theresa May has said police time is being used more efficiently and there is less waste but this shows they have cut so far that it is starting to reduce police visibility.

‘It means the policy of neighbourhood policing, which was very popular, has become if not quite a dead letter, then severely weakened by the reductions in police strength.’

Shadow policing minister Jack Dromey said: ‘Neighbourhood policing – the bedrock of British policing – is being eroded.

There has been a reduction of 20 per cent since 2011 in the amount spent by the Home Office on the police - and chiefs warn foot patrols will decrease more if further cuts are made

‘The Government claims that they have increased the proportion of police officers on the frontline. The public see it different with fewer people saying that they regularly see bobbies on the beat.’

Steve White, chairman of Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said: ‘This underlines the sad fact that, although the public highly values the work that police officers do to keep them safe, they are seeing fewer and fewer of them around on the street.

‘It represents a sad indictment of the Government’s policing policies. Quite clearly, cuts have consequences and the government cuts have severely damaged the service’s ability to keep people safe and lock up criminals.’

Last month police unions in the West Midlands warned police cuts meant bobbies on the beat had become ‘an endangered species’.

The ONS survey found the proportion of people who felt positively about the police rose from 59 per cent in 2010-11 to 63 per cent last year, while those who had confidence in the police rose from 72 per cent to 76 per cent.

According to the Crime Survey of England and Wales, based on people’s experiences of crime, overall crime had fallen 25 per cent since 2010-11 to 7.1million incidents, the lowest since 1981.

The total number of crimes reported to forces in England and Wales has fallen from 4.1million to 3.7million over the same period.

Policing Minister Mike Penning said: ‘Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth since 2010. Citizens and communities are safer than at any point since the survey began.

‘Under this Government, police forces have shown that, with reform, it is possible to deliver more with less.

‘The police watchdog has made clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided. What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are.’
