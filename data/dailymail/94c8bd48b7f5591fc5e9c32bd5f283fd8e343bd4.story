The dangers of ‘post-operative psychosis’ have been highlighted by an investigation into the suicide of British jewellery designer and philanthropist Sandra d’Auriol hours after she had a facelift.

Ms d’Auriol jumped to her death from the roof of a Los Angeles clinic shortly after coming round from the operation in January.

Now the details of the 53-year-old’s last hours have been pieced together in an investigation for US beauty magazine Allure by cosmetic surgery journalist Joan Kron.

Sandra d'Auriol's brother said that he believed that her death was 'a direct result of post-operative psychosis' and that she awoke after the operation in a state of panic

The report reveals Ms d’Auriol’s brother-in-law Guy believes her death was ‘a direct result of post-operative psychosis’ and that she awoke after the operation in a state of panic.

According to the Allure report, Ms d’Auriol ‘pulled at her hair under the surgical gauze dressings, tore off her clothes, and feared for her safety. “We’re all going to die,” she shouted.'

When a nurse tried to restrain her, Ms d’Auriol pushed her to the floor of her 10th-floor room and ran up a stairwell to the roof of the 15-storey clinic.

A ‘crisis negotiation team’, aided by Ms d’Auriol’s husband Yan, tried to talk her into moving away from the edge of the roof, but their efforts were in vain.

A family member said: ‘Yan was feeding [them] information he hoped would yank Sandra out of the psychotic state.’  

Mr d’Auriol had not been allowed by the clinic to see his wife on the evening of her operation.

Reports at the time said post-operative psychosis was a rare occurrence.

But earlier this year Dr Martin Sandler, clinical director in elderly care at Spire Parkway Hospital in Birmingham, claimed up to one in ten older patients develops the condition – and that it is not necessarily a reaction to anaesthetic drugs.

He said: ‘This is a reaction to trauma or unusual circumstances that can be brought on by an operation or by waking up in hospital. They become frightened and anxious.’

He added that the best way to preserve mental wellbeing is for patients to return home as soon as possible and be in a familiar environment among people they know.
