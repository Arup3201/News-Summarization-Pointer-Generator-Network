Millions of us will be embarking on New Year's resolutions to lose weight and eat more healthily this week, and for many, a new juicer is probably high on the shopping list.

Supermodels such as Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley have attributed their streamlined figures to whipping up vitamin-packed juices and smoothies in their kitchens.

But rather than forking out hundreds of pounds on expensive gadgets, we might actually be better off buying much cheaper versions.

Gadget: The Vitamix Total Nutrition Health Centre blender is loved by health-conscious A-listers such as Miranda Kerr, but it will set you back £500

Consumer group Which? says that less 
expensive juicers are often as good as the fancier versions and that we 
shouldn't be tempted to splash out on ones boasting functions we don't 
actually need.

Juicing as a way to lose weight has never been so popular amongst svelte celebrities. Victoria's Secret model Miranda was so keen on her daily smoothie - a chia seed and goji berry concoction - that she invested £500 in a swanky blender, the Vitamix Total Nutrition Health Centre.

The kitchen device markets itself as much more than an ordinary blender thanks to laser-cut blades that reach speeds of 240 mph making light work of fruit and vegetable pulp, skin, pips and seeds.

Fresh fan: Miranda made a video for Net-a-porter showing her fans how to whip up her morning smoothie using the expensive gadget

Which? carried out laboratory tests on 28 different juicers and found that gadgets costing between £50 and £60 scored higher than those on sale for £350 or more.

The top-scoring model, the Philips HR, costs £69.99 and was awarded 75 points out of a possible 100.

Next placed was the Samson 6 in 1 costing £179, with the £54.99 Philips Whole Fruit juicer in third place. 

'A glass of fresh juice can be satisfyingly tasty and refreshing, especially if you've made it yourself,' said a Which? spokesman. 

'But think about how often you are likely to use your juicer, if you have the space, and if you are serious about juicing.'

The Philips HR1861 juicer came top in the Which? survey and costs just £69.99

Last year a survey found that juicers and blenders were two of the top ten kitchen gadgets which most likely to be bought but rarely used. 

Celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson (famous for training Gwyneth and Madonna) is a fan, and personal trainer and nutrition expert James Duigan rates the machines highly too, using one to make 60 shakes a day at Bodyism, his London gym. 

He uses his to blend up shakes for the likes of Bodyism client Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has previously extolled the virtues of his Clean & Lean Body Brilliance and Beauty Food smoothies 
mixed with almond milk and coconut oil. 

Shona Wilkinson, Head Nutritionist at The Nutri Centre, said: 'The numbers of stars following juice diets has sped into the stratosphere of late.

'From A-listers wanting to get red carpet ready to reality stars wanting to trim down and get healthy, they're all on board the juicing train.

'So it was only a matter of time before a new juicing machine took celebsville by storm. 

'Vitamix is a new juicer that claims to speed up the juicing process and leave a smoother, 'no bits' result. Good news for juicing fans.'

Nutritionist Madeleine Shaw, who works with Millie Mackintosh, said: 'Vitamix is awesome, it is obviously the best of the bunch. However Kenwood are making some really good less expensive blenders too.'

Philips HR1861  'One of the easiest models to use - and quiet too'

Samson 6-in-1  'Extracts more great-tasting juice from fruit and veg than other models'

Philips HR1854 Whole Fruit Juicer  'Quick and simple to use and clean'  

Philips HR1858  'Has a foam separator and easy to use' 

Philips HR1869 Avance  'Stylish and juices efficiently'

Personal trainer: James Duigan of Bodisym, who is credited with sculpting Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Elle Macpherson's bodies, is also a fan of the Vitamix blender

 Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, who has one of showbiz's most enviable figures, recently praised her ‘delicious green juice' which she described as 'a 
great way to start the day.'

But what’s behind this mysterious 
concoction? Along with other super healthy ingredients such as cucumber,
 kale and parsley, the Japanese wholefood chlorella is added to the 
juice.

And it’s not just Rosie 
who’s caught the chlorella bug, Miranda 
Kerr has admitted that she takes chlorella supplements to keep her skin 
in check.

green vegetable smoothie

Nadia Brydon, who’s a nutritionist and green food expert at Sun Chlorella, has shared her tips for the perfect morning smoothie....

'With everyone from Rosie Huntington-Whiteley to Millie Mackintosh drinking green smoothies recently, you’d be forgiven for thinking this is just another beauty fad.

'We all know that we’re probably not eating enough greens, yet our greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. 

Green smoothies can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness, and magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak.

Perhaps most importantly, these drinks provide large quantities of whole food natural vitamins and minerals and help increase our daily intake of fruit and vegetables – for busy people who still want to remain healthy, this is hugely important.

Smoothies are also full of fibre and water along with a whole range of nutrients which naturally makes us feel fuller which reduces the desire to consume food generally especially sugar and carbohydrates. We recommend the Rolls Royce of blenders, the Vitamix blender, as it breaks down the cell walls of fresh, whole foods to deliver the full benefit of nutrients. It also saves time as all of the ingredients can be added at once.'

Miranda and Rosie’s green juices and smoothies are so nutritious, simply because greens contain the most vitamins and minerals of any foods we eat, and are the most important category of foods to consume on a daily basis to help keep us healthy. 

Combining these into an easy to drink smoothie can help busy people cram as many of these vegetables into their daily diet as possible. Juicing and blending raw green vegetables and living micro greens (sprouts) containing fresh vibrant green chlorophyll are extremely nutritious ways of creating optimum health and energy.

Just juice: Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has revealed that she loves Chlorella (like those pictured right) green juices

Juicing or blending any raw green vegetable, especially the living leafy varieties, is an effective way of increasing oxygen in the body and helping to build healthy tissues. Oxygen maintains life and is a rejuvenator of all body systems.

Green smoothies containing the ingredients seen in Rosie and Miranda’s can be high in vitamin B12, which can help reduce tiredness.

The spinach in Rosie’s signature smoothie is high in magnesium, which is found in dark green vegetables and can act as nature’s tranquiliser, helping to keep us de-stressed and relaxed – so it’s no wonder so many busy celebs are trying it! 

You’ll notice that a lot of models are now adding green supplements to their juices, to up their nutrient intake even further. For instance, a daily serving of the Japanese wholefood Sun Chlorella contains iron content equivalent to nine cups of spinach (270g) and the same B12 content as a 32oz steak – vitamin D in particular is important for winter, as this nutrient is produced by natural sunlight, and long cold winters can cause Brits to become deficient, meaning it’s important to top up where possible.   To make a Rosie or Miranda style green smoothie, try the delicious recipe below at home. Freshly juiced fruits should always be diluted 50:50 with water in order to dilute the sugar content.  Blend the below ingredients, adding the water first.•    600ml mineral water (still) •    ½ chopped cucumber (skin & pips included) •    ¼ peeled avocado •    1 chopped celery stick •    Juice of ½ lemon or lime •    ¼ teaspoon unrefined salt •    Sun chlorella ‘A’ tablets: initially starting off with 5 tablets for the first three days, moving up to 10 for the next 3 days and then 15 tablets herein after. •    Small double handful (60-80mg) of mixed green leaves from the following (they can be combined): spinach, watercress, rocket, savoy cabbage, chard, lettuce, chicory, kale, bok choy, sprigs of mint, parsley, coriander, basil.
