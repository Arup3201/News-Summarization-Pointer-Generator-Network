A woman has pleaded not guilty to placing a Craigslist ad saying another woman wanted to participate in a 'rape fetish' before providing her home address.

Kathy J Row, 50, was in court on Monday charged with 
identity theft, harassment and solicitation to commit sexual assault. 
She faces more than six years in prison if convicted.

Prosecutor Brendan McHugh said one person responded to the ad andÂ  showed up at the victim's home in California.

It was alleged that Row harassed the woman from last October until June.

She placed a Craigslist ad saying the woman wanted to participate in a sexual assault for her own gratification.

The motive for the alleged harassment hasn't been released.

Row has been banned from contacting her alleged victim and a preliminary hearing was set for January.
