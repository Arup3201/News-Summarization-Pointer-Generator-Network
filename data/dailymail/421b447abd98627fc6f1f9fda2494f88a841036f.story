Manchester United legends Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville have risked the hairdryer treatment by naming a fiery burger after former boss Sir Alex Ferguson.

The duo could face the wrath of Fergie after they added a burger called ‘The Boss’ to the food menu at their new hotel.

'The Boss Burger' is known for its fiery side just like former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson

Giggs and Neville have used the beautiful game as a theme for the £20million Hotel Football which opens its doors to the public in March.

Like Ferguson, ‘The Boss burger’ is known for its fiery side, and includes dry aged beef and Scotch bonnet chillies.

Punters can wash the beefy treat down with a number of football based beverages at the hotel in Manchester.

Drinks include the Red Devil, The Posh, Early Shower, The Equaliser and Extra Thyme, there is even a tribute to club legend Eric Cantona which consists of French ingredients.

The duo also plan to create dishes linked to themselves when the hotel opens its doors to incoming United fans.

Welshman Giggs will be serving up ‘The Wizard’ which is a lamb burger from his homeland and Neville will be creating a chicken and noodle pot with shiitake mushrooms. 

Wayne Rooney’s famous 2011 overhead kick will also be on the menu, but it’s not all United themed burgers on sale.

Chelsea fans can also pop in and taste the ‘The Special One’, a Portuguese chicken burger for manager Jose Mourinho or a 'Goal and Zola' which is a four cheese pizza.
