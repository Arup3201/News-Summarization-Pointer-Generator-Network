A Melbourne-based artist is paying homage to his love of food one stitch at a time.

Phil Ferguson, who is originally from Perth in Western Australia, started crocheting types of food and posting them on Instagram to connect with other artists in the Victorian capital when he moved there in March last year.

The artist - who goes by the name of chiliphilly on social media - told Daily Mail Australia it took him a total of two to three days to complete one of his creations, depending on the design.

A Melbourne-based artist named Phil Ferguson has created 24 crocheted hats since he started in August

The 22-year-old said he started posting the photos on Instagram because he wanted to meet new people in Melbourne

Ferguson said his first attempt was a burger, which was inspired by his place of work, fast food joint Tuck Shop Take Away in Caulfield North - south-east of Melbourne.

'From that point onward I thought about how to do food hats,' the 22-year-old - who studied art at Perth's Curtin University - said. 

'[Food] has been the most accessible thing people can relate to and it will stay that way until I'm bored.'

So far, the artist has crocheted 24 woollen creations and has only been game enough to show them off on Instagram.

His first creation, a burger, was inspired by his place of work called Tuck Shop Take Away

Since then, Ferguson said the response to his art work has been overwhelming

He said the reason why he thought they were popular was because food was accessible to everyone

Ferguson said he only a special occasion would persuade him to don the elaborate pieces.

He said people's response to his work had been very positive.

'It's kind really crazy how it's taken off,' Ferguson said.

'The main reason I started uploading is because I had just moved to Melbourne and it would be way for me to meet other art people.

The artist said the pieces could take up to three days, depending on how elaborate he made the design

Ferguson has gained more than 13,000 followers on Instagram and almost 3,000 likes on Facebook

He is now looking to be more proactive in shaping his pieces and drawing inspiration from his surroundings

'I've never had so many people see my work and I've had such an overwhelming response.

'It's been great. I didn't anticipate it at all.'

He is now looking to be more proactive in shaping his pieces and drawing inspiration from his surroundings.

'I'm going to do like a subversive food blog and make hats based on food places in Melbourne and be actively inspired by things,' he said.

'I want to get more involved and interact with more people.'
