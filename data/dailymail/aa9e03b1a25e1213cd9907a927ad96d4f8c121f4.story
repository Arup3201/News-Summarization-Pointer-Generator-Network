Chelsea star Willian scored the winner as Brazil beat Ecuador in New Jersey to continue Dunga's perfect start as coach.

The decisive moment came on the half-hour when Neymar curled a free-kick over the defence to Willian, who controlled and finished with the outside of his right foot.

Willian was part of a Chelsea trio on the pitch at the MetLife Stadium, with Oscar and Ramires also impressing as Brazil continued their recovery from the summer's World Cup nightmare.

Following on from the weekend's win over Colombia in Miami, new coach Dunga - who replaced Luis Felipe Scolari following the tournament - was encouraged by the victory.

'There weren't any negative points,' he said. 'You have to take the positives from the negatives. You learn, you evolve. So for me it was all positive.

'The players played well against two very good teams. The team raised its ability depending on how difficult the situations were. All the players on this team I felt made the most of their opportunities in these games.'

Brazil were some way from their best but with just seven survivors from the World Cup squad on the United States trip, it will take time to again forge a successful side.

Indeed, Ecuador could have come away with a draw when West Ham's Enner Valencia struck the base of the post after beating goalkeeper Jefferson witha right-foot shot.

He also saw a looping header cleared off the line by Filipe Luis during the second half as Ecuador enjoyed a productive spell.

But Neymar could have made absolutely sure of victory in the 47th minute, only to miss an open goal from four yards with the goalkeeper beaten.

Brazil's defensive quartet of Danilo, Marquinhos, Miranda and Filipe Luis performed well and Dunga gave debuts to Cruzeiro striker Ricardo Goulart and Corinthians defender Gil from the bench.

Neymar, who has returned to action following the back injury sustained at the World Cup, saw the best of the first-half chances with an ambitious shot and a free-kick that both cleared the crossbar.

But Dunga was pleased with how the star performed: 'He's got a good personality and everybody is different. But players react differently to being a leader and he went out there tonight and showed he could play.

'This is one of those games that he has played 90 minutes since the World Cup, and I thought he played well.'
