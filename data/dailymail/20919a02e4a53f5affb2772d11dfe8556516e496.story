Andy Murray has been drawn in the same half as both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon, although he will only have to beat one of them en route to the final.

No 2 seed Murray faces a potential quarter-final against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who he beat at Queen's Club last week, before a potential last-four clash against either Federer or Nadal, who are scheduled to meet in a mouth-watering last-eight tie.

Nadal’s number five seeding proved 
particularly bad news for defending champion Federer, who might be 
hoping that his compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka could take him out in a 
possible fourth round before they even meet. Theirs is a rough quarter 
of the draw.

The lumping in together of Nadal, 
Federer and Murray also means that there will be a blockbuster first day
at Wimbledon on Monday with all three of them in action.

Repeat: Murray will play Benjamin Becker in the first round, who he beat at Queen's Club last week

Old foes: No 5 seed Nadal faces the prospect of a mouth-watering quarter-final against Federer

Murray’s first week looks relatively 
benign until the gradient gets tougher after the middle weekend, 
although it is hardly a straightforward start either. In the first round
he is up against 31 year-old Benjamin Becker, a decent grass court 
player, having beaten him at Queen’s last week.

He could then meet British wildcard 
James Ward, or Taipei’s Yen-Hsun Lu, the world number 74, who beat the 
26 year-old Scot at the Beijing Olympics and is happy on faster surfaces
with a Wimbledon win against Andy Roddick on his CV.

The first two seeds Murray is 
scheduled to meet are Spanish veteran Tommy Robredo and Serb Janko 
Tipsarevic, although what could materialise is a third round against 
excellent grass courter Nicola Mahut, of Wimbledon marathon fame.

Murray’s quarter final opponent is 
slated to be one of Jo Wilfried Tsonga or Marin Cilic, the two players 
he beat over finals weekend at the Aegon Championships. But with Novak 
Djokovic getting the better end of things with David Ferrer the other 
top-four seed in his half, all eyes will be on the potential classic 
match-up of Nadal versus Federer.

Opener: Reigning champion Federer will begin his title defence against Victor Hanescu on Monday

Familiar: Murray could face Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarter-finals, who he beat at Queen's last week

Kind: Novak Djokovic has been drawn in the opposite half to Murray, Nadal and Federer

Kyle Edmund, one of only three 
British men in the main draw, will have a tough baptism against the 
hugely talented 6ft 8ins Pole Jerzy Janowicz, already ranked 22 in the 
world, whose temperament can be an Achilles heel.

World No 1 Novak Djokovic will play Florian Mayer in the first round before a potential quarter-final against Tomas Berdych.

The
Serb has been handed the easier draw with Murray, Federer and Nadal all
on the opposite side. Djokovic could meet either David Ferrer or Juan 
Martin Del Potro in the semis.

French
Open champion Nadal will begin his tournament against Steve Darcis 
while defending champion Federer opens Centre Court proceedings on 
Monday against Victor Hanescu.

Baby-faced: Murray is consoled by Nalbandian in 2005

Andy Murray will make his eighth appearance at Wimbledon looking to end Britain's long wait for a home men's singles champion.

Here, Sportsmail assesses the US Open winner's performances on his previous visits to SW19.

2005: Murray made his senior Wimbledon debut at the age of 18. There was great excitement surrounding the teenager following his win in the US Open juniors in 2004 and he justified the hype by reaching the third round. Murray's first match was a comfortable win over George Bastl and he followed that up by eliminating 14th seed Radek Stepanek. Next up was former finalist David Nalbandian and the young Scot looked set for a famous win when he took a two-set lead before cramp took its toll.

2006: Murray
was now the leading British player and again he did not disappoint. 
Victories over Nicolas Massu and Julien Benneteau set up a blockbuster 
clash with top-five player and former finalist Andy Roddick. Murray had 
beaten the American en route to winning his first ATP Tour title in San 
Jose earlier in the season and he repeated the feat with a brilliant 
straight-sets win. The Scot could not maintain that standard, though, 
and lost to Marcos Baghdatis in the fourth round.

2008: After
missing the 2007 championships with a wrist injury, Murray was looking 
to make up for lost time. He reached the fourth round with relative ease
to set up a clash with Richard Gasquet that turned out to be one of 
Wimbledon's classic encounters as the Scot hit back from two sets and a 
break down to reach the quarter-finals for the first time. Hopes were 
high as he prepared to face eventual champion Rafael Nadal but it proved
to be a one-sided affair in the Spaniard's favour.

2009: With Nadal unable to defend his title because of injury, Murray was the highest seed in his half of the draw. He almost came unstuck in the fourth round against an inspired Stanislas Wawrinka in the first match to be played entirely under the new Centre Court roof before prevailing in a deciding set. Murray reached the semi-finals for the first time and was favourite to see off Roddick but he paid for a cautious approach and was beaten in four sets.

2010: The British number one came into Wimbledon in indifferent form but by the end of the first week it was clear he would be a contender once again. A victory over Gilles Simon in front of the Queen was a highlight and he was not really tested until a quarter-final clash with big-hitting Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. Victory earned the world number four another shot at Nadal but, despite doing most things right, it was not even enough for him to win a set.

2011: Nadal again in the semi-finals, and more despair loomed for Murray. This time he led, and had Nadal in trouble. But a loose forehand early in the second set was the beginning of Murray's demise. Nadal seized on the sign of weakness to win in four sets. Even though Murray felt he was playing better tennis than he had in 2010, it was scant consolation as he said: 'It's tough. But I'm giving it my best shot each time. I'm trying my hardest. That's all you can do. I'm disappointed.'

2012: This time Murray reached the final, and had all of Britain abuzz as he attempted to become the first home champion since Fred Perry in 1936. His opponent, Roger Federer, had other ideas though. Despite making a great start, Murray lost 4-6 7-5 6-3 6-4 as Federer landed his seventh Wimbledon title. Revenge of sorts came in the London 2012 Olympic final, back at Wimbledon, as Murray thrashed Federer.
