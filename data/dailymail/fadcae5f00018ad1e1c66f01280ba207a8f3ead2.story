Three premature babies have died and many others seriously injured after being wiped with an antiseptic solution, it has emerged.

Now doctors have been urged to be cautious when using chlorhexidine antiseptic on tiny babies after health experts noted a number of cases of chemical burns and other serious side effects in premature infants.

The solution has even been linked to the deaths of three babies in the UK, officials said.

Experts at the London-based Medicines
 and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) have asked doctors to 
use the solution with care after noticing a pattern of burns 
among premature babies.

A
 total of 28 newborns in the UK have suffered ‘serious side effects’ 
after being wiped down with the antiseptic before a catheter was 
inserted.

These side effects included chemical burns, which caused skin loss in some cases, or a skin condition called erythema.

Chlorhexidine is frequently used to prevent catheter-related blood stream infections among premature babies.

The MHRA received 13 reports of ‘serious
 side effects’ among children who were treated with a chlorhexidine 
solution between 2004 and 2013.

Experts at the regulator have also identified a further 16 cases in medical records between 1992 and 2014.

Of the 29 cases, four of the babies died including three in the UK and one in the United States.

A total of 28 newborns in the UK have suffered ‘serious side effects’ after being wiped down with the antiseptic before a catheter was inserted.

Side effects included chemical burns, which caused skin loss in some cases, or a skin condition called erythema.

The chemical injuries occurred in premature babies who were born and treated with the solution before 32 weeks of pregnancy.

A total of 12 reports of 'serious side effects' were reported among children who were treated with a chlorhexidine solution between 2004 and 2013 and 16 cases in medical literature between 1992 and 2014.

Of the 29 cases, four of the babies died including three in the UK and one in the United States.

Experts have said that the solution itself should be harmless if used correctly and new guidelines have been issued.

One baby died in the UK in 2005 and while the cause of death given was kidney failure, chlorhexidine is thought to be a possible contributing factor in the case, an MHRA spokesman said.

A further two children died in 2010. 
The cause of death recorded in the first case was chronic lung disease 
and prematurity, and in the second case no cause of death was given.

The
 baby is thought to have died as a result of complications related to 
extreme prematurity. But the spokesman said that in both cases 
chlorhexidine is thought to be a possible contributing factor.

The case in the U.S. was not linked to the use of the antiseptic.

The
 MHRA said that the chemical injuries occurred in premature babies who 
were born and treated with the solution before 32 weeks of pregnancy.

A
 drug safety update issued by the regulator gave fresh advice for health
 workers on the use of the chemical including, using the minimum amount 
of the solution to treat small babies and monitoring them frequently if 
they are treated with the antiseptic.

Any nappies or sheets soaked with the solution should be removed, it added.

The MHRA said that European health officials will be reviewing the issue.

‘Hospital use of chlorhexidine has a crucial role in preventing infection in premature infants, which is a leading cause of death in neonatal units and is used safely many thousands of times every year in hospitals,’ said Dr June Raine, director of MHRA’s Vigilance and Risk Management of Medicines Division.

‘Our monthly bulletin, Drug Safety Update, includes information on a small number of historic reports of serious side-effects, including four suspected deaths, in premature infants associated with the use of this product. Two of these were thought to be due to severe complications of prematurity.

‘We have also given guidance to healthcare professionals to use the minimum solution required and to remove any excess bearing in mind the risk in very pre-term infants.’

Dr Martin Ward-Platt, a spokesman for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, added: ‘This stuff should be harmless, if harm is caused it is likely to be a training or knowledge issue.

'This is avoidable and a harm these babies should not be at risk of. Nobody’s baby should come to harm because of this.’
