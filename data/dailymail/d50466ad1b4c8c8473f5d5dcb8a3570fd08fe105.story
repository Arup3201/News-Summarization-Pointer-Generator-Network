Wayne Hennessey, take a bow. Then your man-of-the-match prize.

It requires something special to shift the Welsh spotlight away from Gareth Bale, but on a night when the Real Madrid player did not quite produce his comic-book heroics, Crystal Palace's second choice staopper earned his nation a point with a performance that defied logic as much as the Bosnian attack on Friday night.

Out from the Selhurst Park freezer, his string of saves very nearly got Wales all three. 

In added time, Bale advanced with predatory instinct and struck a fearsome shot that Asmir Begovic strained every sinew to tip wide. Then Bale whipped over the corner but Hal Robson-Kanu to get himself in a mess from two yards out.

Ashley Williams had an excellent chance too in the 78th minute, arriving unmarked onto Bale’s free-kick six yards out only to head over.

Hennessey provided that platform though, his best save of the night coming 10 minutes from the end. Miralem Pjanic hit his free-kick from 25 yards with dip and swerve but Hennessey threw his 6ft 6in frame into the air, reached up a glove, and diverted the ball wide.

It was as thrilling as goalless draws come, and sees Wales top Group B in qualifying for Euro 2016.

This was the most eagerly anticipated home international in years and it showed in the roads around Cardiff. Heavy traffic meant the stadium bore plenty of empty seats at kick-off. Eventually the projected 30,741 crowd assembled to mark the biggest since England visited the Millenium in March 2011.

They had come hoping to see Wales make a statement of their intentions in this qualifying campaign; they had come wanting Bale to do the business again.

In the seventh minute, he should have. Joe Ledley fed the ball to Chris Gunter on the right wing and the Reading player immediately saw Bale had somehow been granted more space in the Bosnia area than he might expect walking atop Mount Snowdon.

A swift cross followed but, from inside the six-yard box, Bale fluffed his lines and missed the ball. Defender Toni Sunjic leapt to divert it for a corner.

It was a promising start nevertheless. Bale had another opportunity when Ben Davies sent a high pass forward but world’s most expensive left boot only managed to send a lofted volley wide.

Then Gunter volleyed over from Neil Taylor’s cross.

Gradually, though, with Everton’s Muhamed Besic doing an excellent job marking Bale, Bosnia gained increasing possession. Pjanic, so effective for Roma at Manchester City in the Champions League, was at the heart of most it.

He had already seen a deflected shot from range test Hennessey before he fired an effort just wide in the 27th minute.

The second period saw Hennessey come to the fore. He may be keeping the Palace bench warm but he was alert time and again as Bosnia laid siege to the Welsh goal for the first ten minutes after the interval.

He spread himself to deny Haris Medunjanin from four yards following Tino-Sven Susic’s cross, then saved twice from Edin Dezko, the second at full-stretch as the City striker nodded a high ball into the far corner.

His second save from Medunjanin, as Wales groaned under the pressure, was just as impressive. He pushed the Bosnian’s shot from range far away from the three lurking attackers.

The intensity of the evening was laid bare when a mass melee broke out following James Chester’s firm, yet fair, tackle on Besic that earned him an undeserved yellow card. Ashley Williams and Dzeko were both booked by referee Vladislav Bezborodov, seemingly for the crime of being captains.

The episode illustrated Welsh steel, something missing during previous campaigns. ‘We dug deep,’ said manager Chris Coleman. ‘Last time we got bullied by Bosnia (in a 2012 friendly) but we were never bullied tonight.’
