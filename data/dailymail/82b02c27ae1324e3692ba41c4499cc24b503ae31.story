This shocking image shows the moment two couples were pictured getting intimate in a nightclub car park in Belfast.

The disturbing photo, which was tweeted by a stunned by-passer, shows two female clubbers sat astride two men, appearing to have sex - while one seemingly glances at her phone. 

The scene, which was caught outside the El Divino nightclub, comes just weeks after footage of a Northern Irish girl giving oral sex to 24 men emerged from the notorious holiday resort of Magaluf.

A Twitter user posted a photo of two couples appearing to have sex in the car park 
of a nightclub in Belfast, just weeks after a shocking video emerged of a
 Northern Irish girl giving oral sex to 24 men in notorious resort Magaluf

Hours after it was posted, the image taken in Belfast went viral, with hundreds taking to Twitter to express their disgust. 

Michael McMahon, who users the Twitter handle, @MichaelMcMufin, tweeted the image, which was captioned: 'People have no shame, outside El Divino. This is traumatic.'

He added: 'First the slane girl, now these dirty f****** in Belfast #dignityatzero'.

Another user also tweeted saying: 'First #SlaneGirl then magaluf video girl was from NI, now pics of people outside el divino have emerged. Way to make us all look classy!'

And user @ShharonDoherty posted: 'IMAGINE. Jesus H Christ, these people need saved'.

El
 Divino, which is popular with students, calls itself the 'newest and 
most fashionable nightclub' which has 'changed the face of clubbing' in 
Belfast'.

The incident is said to have taken place in the car park outside El Divino, a club popular with students and billed as having 'changed the face' of clubbing in the Northern Ireland city

But the image - which shows the two men lying on the floor while both women, who are wearing white dresses, sit on their lap - led to users questioning the club's credentials.

One Twitter user Aimee said: 'And we though el divino was a classy spot'.

The image has caused outrage in the wake of the Magaluf video, featuring a 21-year-old girl who performed the sex acts in return for alcohol.

Pub crawl organisers Carnage Magaluf has said it is 
working with local authorities to make sure the scenes in the footage, which were released via social media, 
are not repeated after new regulation was introduced last week.

But pictures have continued to emerge from the Spanish island showing the consequences of the drink-fuelled culture which shocked a nation.

The video led to some celebrities distancing themselves from the resort, including The Only Way Is Essex stars cancelling an appearance at a party hosted by Carnage Magaluf.

James 'Arg' Argent and Dan Osborne, who both feature in the hit ITV show, announced they would not be taking part in the event after footage of the incident emerged two weeks ago.

TV presenter Jeremy Kyle also fell foul of Magaluf this week when he was pepper-sprayed by a bouncer while trying to film one of the clubs.

The nightclub worker said he sprayed Kyle because he 'wasn't showing the good side of Magaluf'.
