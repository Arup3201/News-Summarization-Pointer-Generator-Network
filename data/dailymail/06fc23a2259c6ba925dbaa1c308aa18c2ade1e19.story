Medical examiners have identified the 1,639th victim of the World Trade Center attacks as a 31-year-old Belgian national who worked in the North Tower. 

Patrice Braut, was working in the North Tower for Marsh & McLennan Companies on the 97th floor when the passenger jet struck the building.

The Brussels native was the only Belgian to die in the attacks. His remains were recovered between 2001 and 2002 although they were only identified this week.

Braut is the 1,639th person to be identified by the medical examiner's office. The forensic team still has to identify 1,114 of the estimated 2,753 reported killed on 9/11 at the World Trade Center. 

His mother Paola visited New York earlier this month to commemorate the atrocity which claimed the life of her only child. 

According to the New York Times, this is the first time since May that experts have positively identified a 9/11 victim. 

It is understood that there are 7,930 fragments of human remains still to be positively identified. 

The remains are being held in a repository beside the 9/11 museum at Ground Zero. 

Forensic scientists faced a major task identifying the remains of those killed on 9/11. 

Just 17 people were identified by sight alone, while 305 were determined by fingerprints. 

Experts found 25 people by photographs, a further 78 by personal effects and 534 by dental records, x-rays or tattoos. 

Speaking soon after the attack, Chief Medical Officer Charles Hirsch announced that many of the victims had been vapourised in the attacks.  

New York's Chief Medical Officer said that many of the 9/11 victims were vapourised in by the explosions
