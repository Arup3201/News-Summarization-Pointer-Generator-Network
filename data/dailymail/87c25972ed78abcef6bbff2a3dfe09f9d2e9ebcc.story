Tory MPs had threatened to rebel against the government if George Osborne pressed ahead with January's 3p rise in fuel duty

A 3p rise in fuel duty planned for January will not go ahead, easing the pressure on motorists who have seen prices at the pump soar.

In a rare piece of good news in a grim economic statement today, George Osborne has agreed not to impose the New Year hike.

Mr Osborne said he had been advised to delay the rise until April, but has instead decided to scrap it 'completely'.

However, a planned 3p fuel duty rise for April next year will be delayed until September 2013 but will go ahead.

If the Chancellor had gone ahead with the January rise it would have added £2.53 to the cost of filling up a family car.

Experts say it will save the average driver £7.69-a-month.

He told MPs: 'That is real help for the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country.'

With growth sluggish and borrowing higher than expected, the Chancellor has little spare cash to woo voters.

But
he risked a political backlash if he had pressed ahead with the rise, 
because it would coincide with rail and bus fare rises, hammering 
families and commuters no matter how they get around.

Mr Osborne used last year's Autumn Statement to scrap a planned 3p rise in fuel duty for January 2012.

A scheduled rise for August was cut from 5p to 3p, but in June this year he postponed it until January 2013. Now he has decided to scrap the January rise, confirming it in today's Autumn Statement in the Commons.

'There is a 3p-per-litre rise planned for this January. Some have suggested we delay it until April. I disagree. I suggest we cancel it altogether,' he said.

The Treasury said delaying and scrapping series of fuel duty hikes means the cost of a litre of fuel would be 10p higher in 2014-15 under Labour than under the coalition

'There will be no 3p fuel tax rise this January. That is real help with the cost of living for families as they fill up their cars across the country. And it will help businesses too.

'It means that under this Government we’ll have had no increase in petrol taxes for nearly two and a half years. In fact they have been cut.'

The rises were all planned by the last Labour government to hit drivers after they left office. If they had all gone ahead it would have added 13p to a litre of fuel, breaking through the £1.50-a-litre mark.

A damning report by the Institute of 
Economic Affairs think tank revealed the high cost of fuel was even 
encouraging people to live on benefits because driving to work makes it 
uneconomical to get a job.

The
study said: ‘Motoring taxes may increase welfare dependency by raising 
travel-to-work costs, meaning many potential workers may be better off 
on welfare benefits than entering employment.’

Within
certain income ranges, some workers face marginal tax rates as high as 
96 per cent. This means that for every extra £1 earned, the person is 
better off by just four pence because of high fuel costs.

With fuel duty and VAT combined, tax makes up almost two thirds of the price drivers pay for petrol. This graph shows how the latest cost of petrol (133.19p per litre) and diesel (141.06p) stack up.

Mr
Osborne signalled his intention to postpone the 3p rise last month, 
when dozens of Conservative MPs threatened to join Labour in a Commons 
vote on the cost of living.

Tory
MP Robert Halfon, who founded www.PetrolPromise.com to put pressure on 
ministers to act to bring down the cost of fuel, said it was the ‘number
one issue raised by backbenchers with the Chancellor of the Exchequer's
team’.

RAC technical director David Bizley said: 'The Chancellor had little option but to listen to the voice of British motorists and businesses and scrap the 3p fuel duty rise planned for January otherwise he would have faced a national outcry.

'The RAC and FairFuelUK have worked tirelessly behind the scenes to encourage politicians to recognise the significant impact the price of fuel is having on our lives and how it is stifling the economy, inflating retail prices and reducing our competitive position against Europe.'

The Tory MP who lead the fight 
against a planned 3p rise in fuel duty today thanked the Chancellor for 
backing 'white van Conservatives'.

Robert Halfon, who was a vocal critic
of the planned rise ahead of a Commons debate on the issue last month, 
praised George Osborne’s move to scrap the January tax increase.

During the Autumn Statement, the Chancellor said he was not merely postponing the 3p rise to April but scrapping it altogether.

During questions on the statement, 
Harlow MP Mr Halfon said: 'Can I thank you on behalf of my colleagues 
and Fair Fuel UK for putting the fuel back into the tank of white van 
Conservatives across the country.

'Can you confirm the scrapping of the
3p petrol rise, not just for three months but permanently, will mean 
the average Harlow resident is better off by £80 to £100 next year?'

Mr Osborne replied: 'I congratulate 
you for speaking for motorists and families across the country against 
Labour’s fuel tax rises.

'You
speak for Harlow man and woman and I’m glad, as a result of your 
campaigning and difficult decisions we have taken elsewhere to control 
public spending, we have been able to cancel altogether that fuel duty 
rise due for January.'

The news that the January rise will not 
go ahead was also welcomed by hauliers, who warned rising fuel costs 
were eating into their profit margins.

Alistair Bingle, managing director of 
removals firm Bishop’s Move, said: 'The 3p-a-litre fuel duty rise, which
would have come into effect in January, would have had a severely 
negative impact on the haulage industry and a potential loss of jobs 
right down the ladder. For me there is no argument – the fuel duty 
freeze had to happen and I’m delighted that it has.'

Hard-pressed motorists have been 
cutting down on the miles they drive to conserve fuel, but near record 
levels of fuel duty have been pouring into the Treasury.

Since 1991-92 the amount of fuel used in the UK has fallen by 20 per cent to 50.6billion litres.

But over the same period fuel duty receipts have more than doubled from less than £11billion to £26.8billion in 2011-12.

Edmund King, AA president, said: ‘Drivers in the UK have followed Government advice to purchase more fuel efficient vehicles.

‘It
is remarkable that fuel consumption has fallen 20 per cent in two 
decades. However, drivers are contributing 144 per cent more in fuel 
duty tax so shouldn’t be stung by another hike in January.’

With average UK petrol prices now at 133.19p per litre, fuel duty accounts for 57.95p, according to the AA.

The Treasury is on course to rake in almost £27billion from fuel duty this year - the second highest ever.

The AA said the said the Government should be putting its energy into tackling inflated and ‘bloated’ pump prices - currently at around 135p a litre - driven artificially high by ‘speculators’ and proving much slower to come down than go up.

Energy minister John Hayes has ordered a report into whether oil firms have rigged the market, forcing up the price of fuel for drivers.

It will also examine the number of petrol stations which have closed and the how far drivers in rural areas have to travel to reach the pumps.
