His friends keep telling him it will never take off.

But in the face of those who doubt him, farmer Li Housheng, 52, is determined to get his makeshift helicopter off the ground.

He began building the twin-rota aircraft at his home in Ganzhou Village of Baitang Township in Miluo, China, last year, using an engine from an agricultural motorcycle

The skeletons are made of angle iron and stainless steel tubes while each rotor is simply a welding of four steel plates. It even includes an accelerator, a clutch and a joystick, all of which come from an agricultural motorcycle.

The helicopter recently completed a test flight with the fuselage hopping a staggering 40cm off the ground, according to Li.

Inspirational: Farmer Li Housheng examines the engine of his makeshift helicopter in Ganzhou Village of Baitang Township, China. He said during a test flight the aircraft lifted 40cms off the ground

Ready: He introduces his flight plan to friends as he sits in his cockpit. The 52-year-old started making his twin-rotor contraption last year and dreams of building a plane

Innovative: He has used parts of an agricultural motorcycle to build the DIY chopper, including the gearbox, engine, joystick and handlebars

Vision: The project has become his pride and joy and he believes he will one day fulfill his dream, of flying higher

Lightning fast: The speedometer from his motorcycle is also fully operational, but he is yet to reach his desired velocity

Supplies: He delves into his extensive shed of tools when he needs to carry out maintenance work

Modifications: Here, he is seen working on another part of the engine. Each of the parts have been developed using scrap from vehicles he keeps on his farm

Li makes some small adjustments to the middle of the aircraft where the two rota blades are attached. A can of petrol is attached to the top of the aircraft with a pipe

Inspiration? Aminu Abubakar, 24, stands next to his four-seater helicopter he put together in 2007 in Nigeria

Li's dream: Kenyan Gabriel Nderitu built this plane out of aluminum bars, bolts and plastic sheeting he salvaged before sticking it all together
