A suspected Sudanese war criminal who claimed to have slaughtered so many people that he 'lost count' is living off British benefits.

Unemployed Mohamed Salim boasts that he is unsupervised by the authorities and never visits police.

The alleged killer now lives in a leafy street in Birmingham, a far cry from his former life in Sudan, where he claimed that he had been a member of the violent Janjaweed militia.

The genocide has spread throughout Darfur, with innocent civilians being attacked as Janjaweeds destroy whole communities

Refugees from Darfur are persecuted by the Janjaweed, which Salim once claimed to be a part of

Salim, 27, arrived in the UK in 2006, and claimed in an anonymous interview with BBC's Newsnight programme that he, along with the brutal gang, were paid by the Sudanese government to pillage and kill innocent people.

The Janjaweed militia ransacked entire villages during the genocide in Darfur, which began in 2003.

In the interview, where he shielded most of his face, the asylum seeker claimed he was paid £50 a day to wipe out resistance - often slaying women, children and innocent people.

It was this candid interview, where he said: 'Sometimes they said "wipe out an entire village". And we shoot to kill,' that he was brought to the attention to the UK Border Agency's war crime unit, the Daily Mirror reported.

But he does not have to leave the country - as an immigration court in Birmingham has ruled that his life could be at risk if he returned to Sudan, and this would be a breach of his human rights.

Women and children were among those killed, injured and raped by the brutal Janjaweed gang, which Salim claimed he had been a part of

The asylum seeker says that he much prefers life in England than Sudan, and likes to watch football in Birmingham bars

Now he lives in Birmingham, where he is an avid West Bromwich Albion supporter and goes to college to learn English for free, he told the newspaper.

He likes to go to bars in Birmingham to watch football matches and says there are more opportunities in the UK.

He said: 'My life here is normal. I much prefer it in England than in Sudan.

'I came here because I listened to friends who said it was good to live here and claim asylum here. I don’t pay to live in this house.'

He then denied what he had said in the interview.

He told the Daily Mirror that he did not participate in the horrific ethnic cleansing, claiming he wanted to escape Janjaweed and had never killed anybody.

The UKBA maintains that he does report to them and is strictly monitored, contrary to his boasts.

A UKBA spokesman said he has been reporting to them since he arrived and said: 'We cannot comment on the individual case as there is ongoing litigation.'

In 2003, two Darfuri rebel movements- the Sudan Liberation Army (SLA) and the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM)- declared war against the Sudanese government, complaining about the marginalization of the area and the failure to protect sedentary people from attacks by nomads. 

The government of Sudan have been accused of retaliating by unleashing Arab militias known as Janjaweed, or 'devils on horseback' who attacked hundreds of villages.

Over 400 villages were completely destroyed and millions of civilians were forced to flee their homes.

In the ongoing genocide, African farmers and others are being systematically displaced and murdered by the Janjaweed.

The genocide in Darfur has claimed 400,000 lives and displaced over 2,500,000 people.

The United Human Rights Council estimates that more than 100 people continue to die each day; 5,000 die every month. 

The Sudanese government disputes these figures and deny any connection with the Janjaweed.
