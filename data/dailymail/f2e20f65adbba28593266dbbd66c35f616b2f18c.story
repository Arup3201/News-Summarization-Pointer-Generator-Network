Secret recordings made on the day New Zealand tourist Warriena Tagpuno Wright plunged to her death from a high-rise building led to Gold Coast bodybuilder Gable Tostee being charged with her murder.

On Saturday, Tostee, 28, will appear in Southport Magistrates Court - exactly eight days after Ms Wright fell 14 storeys from the balcony of his Avalon Apartments unit on Surfers Paradise - and is expected to plead not guilty to killing the 26-year-old.

After more than a week of investigations by police, the 28-year-old was brought to Southport watchhouse in handcuffs from his parents' Carrara home - west of the Gold Coast tourist strip - where he was officially charged.

The case against Tostee - who has boasted about his conquests online - was brought about after police seized footage allegedly showing the meeting between him and Ms Wright when they connected via mobile dating app Tinder. according to The Daily Telegraph.

Tostee has also previously revealed he was 'obsessed' with recording videos on an online bodybuilding forum.

Ms Wright was on a two-week holiday for a friend's wedding but the trip took a tragic turn when her body was found in the early morning hours of Friday, August 8, at the bottom of the Wahroonga Place building.

Within minutes, police arrived at the scene after a male witness raised the alarm and searched the apartment from which she fell, but it was empty.

Hours later, Tostee presented himself to police at the Surfers Paradise station where he was questioned for more than two hours with his lawyer before being released without charge.

At the time, police said Tostee had 'exercised his right to silence'.

The 28-year-old also took to social media to deny his involvement in Ms Wright's death.

'I absolutely did not cause this girl to fall and I am devastated about what happened to her,' he posted.

Warriena Tagpuno Wright's sister Reza said she had spoken to her about eight hours before Ms Wright fell to her death

But after week-long investigations, charges were laid on Tostee who wore thongs, black shorts and a white T-shirt as he was escorted in handcuffs flanked by two detectives in black suits into custody.

He arrived at the watchhouse just after 12.30pm and almost two hours later at 2.02pm he was charged with murder.

Tostee's lawyer told the ABC he would plead not guilty to a charge of murder and would be seeking bail.

On Thursday, the sister of Ms Wright spoke out about her grief after losing 'the most important person' in her life.

Reza Tagpuno Wright, 23, braved the public glare of the media described her sister - who worked at Kiwibank - as funny, a practical joker, supportive and her 'best friend'.

She arrived in Australia from New Zealand with her mother, Beth Wright - senior member of member of the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Porirua - three weeks after Ms Wright made the same trip.

In her sister's honour, Reza lit a candlelight and had a beer at the site where Ms Wright's body was found, according to The Daily Telegraph.

Leading up to Tostee's arrest, it was revealed he was a regular on the Gold Coast's party strip and often visited nightclubs such as Crazy Horse, Cocktails, Club Liv, Bourbon Bar, Players, Alive, Vanity and Sin City.

But he was banned from two of them after staff deemed his behaviour as 'creepy'.

A bouncer at one of the clubs along the strip told Daily Mail Australia Mr Tostee would obsessively film events with his phone and in one case a violent incident outside a club until he was told to leave.

Tostee hit back at reports police took footage away from his Gold Coast unit of his conquests.

Footage aired on Nine News earlier this week reportedly shows Mr Tostee hosting a girl in an apartment.

It shows a woman apparently stealing his wallet before leaving in the middle of the night.

'This footage was from a security camera in the living room of my previous apartment at Circle on Cavill in 2012. I only had one other camera in the apartment which was at the front entry facing the door. Neither camera was used to film sexual encounters,' Tostee wrote on Facebook.

Reza, 13, said her sister was her 'best friend' and she wants to know what happened to her

Reza broke down as she said: 'It's hard for me facing the loss of my sister without knowing what happened in the last hours of her life'

During investigations, Detective Superintendent Dave Hutchinson said police had obtained statements from 'a number of women'.

Detectives also interviewed his parents Gray and Helene Tostee at their home in a gated community in Carrara, where their son had been hiding out since the incident happened.

'He has exercised his right to silence,' Det Supt Hutchinson told Daily Mail Australia earlier this week.

Supt Hutchinson said a 'forensic procedure order' had been carried out against Tostee, which is believed to have included blood samples and a DNA swab.

Despite his refusal to talk to police, Tostee took to a body building forum three times on Monday to talk about the investigation.

At 10.21am, he wrote on the forum: 'I've been advised not to go into details but all I will say is that I absolutely did NOT cause this girl to fall and that I am devastated about what happened to her.'

About an hour later, he posted again: 'Fact is I’ve taken home probably about 150 girls from clubs over the last few years. When you go out often to the same places and get drunk and talk to girls you’re bound to get noticed and hated on, and people gossip.

'Eventually it turns into Chinese whispers where people have a completely false impression of you.

'Most people who know me have been completely supportive, it's those who don't know me at all who assume the worst.'

Thirteen minutes later, at 11.31am, he added: 'My reputation has already been destroyed without me saying anything at all. It’s nothing I haven’t already posted in this thread, but that’s all I have to say for now.'
