The father of Argentina and Juventus star Carlos Tevez has been freed after being kidnapped and held for eight hours.

Segundo Tevez was taken by a group of assailants at around sunrise on the outskirts of Buenos Aires but was 'in good shape' after being released, according to the family's lawyer Gustavo Galasso.

Argentine TV station C5N said Tevez was set free after a payment of 40,000 pesos (£3,000) but neither the family nor the police confirmed this.

Concern: Carlos Tevez was granted permission by his club Juventus to travel back to Argentina

The former Manchester United and Manchester City striker was given permission by Juventus to leave Italy but reports there said he was not going back to Argentina following news of the release.

La Nacion
 in Argentina reported that Tevez was driving his car in the 
municipality of Moron, a province of Buenos Aires, when he was taken 
hostage in the early hours of Tuesday morning.

The
 Volkswagen Vento vehicle has been found abandoned and Argentine 
websites claim that the three men reportedly guilty were not aware of 
the identity of Tevez’s father but once they discovered his background, 
they made extortionate financial demands over the phone to the player’s 
family.

Tevez was adopted by his maternal aunt and her husband, Segundo Tevez, as a baby.
