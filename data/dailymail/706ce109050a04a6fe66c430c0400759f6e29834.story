Disney reopened a controversial attraction at its Orlando theme-park on Friday after it was removed over claims it mocked fat children.

Habit Heroes an interactive educational program at Epcot was launched last February with the aim of helping kids live more healthily.

Its animated characters depicting a rotund fairy called Snacker; an exercise averse character called Lead Bottom and a greedy baddy known as The Glutton were battled by happy and fit action figures called Will Power and Callie Stenics when the attraction first opened.

But for many the message went too far and complaints flooded in that the exhibit stigmatized overweight children.

The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance said in a statement: 'We're appalled to learn that Disney, a traditional hallmark of childhood happiness and joy, has fallen under the shadow of negativity and discrimination.

'It appears that Disney now believes that using the tool of shame, favored so much by today's healthcare corporations, is the best way to communicate with children'.

Dr. Yoni Freedhoff, an assistant professor of family medicine, told the Calgary Herald, 'It's so dumbfounding it's unreal. I just can't believe somebody out there thought it was a good idea to pick up where the school bullies left off and shame kids on their vacation.'

The sight was closed after a month but reopened on Friday minus the taunting characters, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

'When the attraction had its soft opening last February, the creative team sought guest feedback," said Brent Strong, creative director for Walt Disney Imagineering, who oversaw the project told the Sentinel this week.

'We found that some pieces were getting in the way of our story, which is that healthy living can make us all feel like super heroes. We had to try to tell that story in a different way.'Â 

This time the theme park sought input from experts in obesity and removed all the obese characters.

'Rather than single out one population, this message reminds guests that everyone is responsible for health choices as individuals, within their families and finally in their communities,' Tony Jenkins from the insurance firm Florida Blue, which sponsors the ride, told the Sentinel.

'I liked the first one. I like this one even more'.
