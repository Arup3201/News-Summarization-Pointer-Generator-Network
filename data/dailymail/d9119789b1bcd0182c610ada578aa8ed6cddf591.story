Most of us are experts at recognising people's identity, gender and age just by looking at their face.

But much of what we see is based on the context we see it in – and our brains are masters are tricking us into perceiving things that aren’t there.

You can test this by staring steadily at the top red square in the below image for just fraction of a minute.

Stare at the top red square in the above image for just fraction of a minute. Shift your gaze to the bottom red square – what do you see?

Out of the corner of your eye, you are likely to see Bill Clinton on the left and his successor, George Bush, on the right.

Shift your gaze, without hesitating, to the bottom red square – what do you see?

Most people see George W Bush in the left image on the left and Clinton on the right.

But blink several times and take a step back. A closer look at the photos reveals that both photos are the same morphed image of the presidents.

This illusion is an instance of a phenomena, called sensory adaptations, according to a report in Scientific American.

It was created by Leicester University in an attempt to understand the process going on in the brain when people mix up faces.

Pictured are face-selective regions in the brain. Face-selective regions (yellow) are defined as regions that respond more strongly to faces than houses, cars and novel objects

They believe that while neurons register an image of the outside world, they are also actively constructing the image based on its context.

To test their theory, researchers at Leicester, along with the University of California, implanted wires in the brains of patients at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA.

This illusion is an instance of a phenomena, called sensory adaptations. 

There are of visual cells in the occipital lobes that process the vision of objects based on their contect.

These cells can undergo sensory adaptation, as seen in the 'waterfall illusion'. 

If a person views a moving picture of a waterfall for several minutes and then looks at a still picture of the same waterfall, the picture of the waterfall will appear to be moving upward.

This is because the visual cells have adapted to the downward motion. To prevent motion sickness, the other visual cells must counteract that motion. 

They recorded from a cell that fired selectively to a picture of Clinton. When they next asked the patient to look at a photograph of Bush, the cell was silent.

This showed the cell preferred the sight of Clinton over that of Bush. Immediately afterward, a blended picture was shown, and the patient had to decide which president they could see.

The patient was more likely to see Clinton when previously exposed to four seconds of Bush, and vice versa.

‘In 62 neurons from 10 patients, the response to the morphed picture was significantly stronger when the patient recognized the neuron's preferred face, compared with when the patient reported the face that the neuron did not care about,’ wrote Christof Koch, Chief Scientific Officer of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle.

‘Indeed, statistically, the strength of the neuron's response to a pure Clinton could not be distinguished from the response to Clintush, as long as the subject reported seeing Clinton.’

The results, he says, prove that the brain has a powerful process from which it constructs images based on its surroundings – and sometimes what you are seeing could just be in your imagination.
