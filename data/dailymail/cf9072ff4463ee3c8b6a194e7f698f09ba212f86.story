The hunter becomes the hunted as a wily desert fox decides its had quite enough of being chased the African savannah by a Cheetah and decides to chase it around instead.Â 

The female big cat had been stalking a Thomson's gazelle around in Tanzania's Ngorongoro conservation area when two bat-eared foxes wandered a little too close to her cubs.

Deciding that the foxes would maker an easy dinner, the cheetah allowed the gazelle to escape and set off after one of the foxes instead.

However after it twisted and turned to get away the fox decided it wasn't going down without a fight and ended up charging the cheetah taking her by such surprise she ran away with her tail between legs.

As the humbled mum regrouped with her cubs they left hungry while the foxes kept watch looking pleased they had lived to see another day.

The amazing moment was captured in February by photographer Stu Porter, 37, while on a safari his company organised in the Ngorongoro Conservation area in Tanzania.

He said: 'The female cheetah was clearly intent on hunting and she zeroed in on the gazelle but while she was in mid-hunt a group of bat eared foxes bundled towards the two cubs.

'They immediately got interested in the foxes and stalked right up to them - at first the foxes stood their ground and faced the cheetahs but then they decided to run.

'This kicked off the chase instinct in the mum and she began chasing the foxes all over the place as which didn't go unnoticed by the gazelle which took off.

'All of a sudden the foxes decided they had enough and turned on the cheetah and chased it off almost in a split second before regrouping and looking very satisfied with their efforts.

'It all lasted a few minutes and as the foxes made off the cheetahs caught their breath realising they had missed out on two meals in the space of minutes.

'I would assume this kind of confrontation happens quite a lot in the wild however it would be rarely witnessed, we were very lucky to be in the right place at the right time.'
