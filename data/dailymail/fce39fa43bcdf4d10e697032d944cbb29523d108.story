Despite notching up four straight Bundesliga wins Sebastian Kehl admits Dortmund's focus remains firmly on avoiding relegation this season.

After a dismal run of form Jurgen Klopp's side were bottom of the league and looked in real danger of falling out of the top flight.

In the last month, however, Dortmund have transformed their fortunes and moved up to 10th in the Bundesliga with a  last weekend's 3-0 win against local rivals Schalke.

But ahead of their visit to Hamburg on Saturday former German international midfielder Kehl insists the players are looking no further than retaining their status in the top tier of German football. 

'We lost at home to Hamburg earlier this season and that helped give them a bit of a boost,' the veteran midfielder, 35, told Ruhr Nachrichten.

'This time we hope we can be the ones getting three points. We urgently need to reach our goal.

'Nothing's changed on that front. CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke and the coaches issued a 40-point target and to avoid relegation. That's all that matters right now.'
