North Korea has sanctioned a video to recruit foreign runners for the 2015 Pyongyang marathon featuring a cover of A-ha's 1984 hit 'Take On Me' by an accordion band favoured by the rogue state's dictator. 

As well as the accordions, the chirpy, propaganda-influenced advert features footage from 2002 North Korean film, Marathon Runner. It was based on the true story of Jong Song Ok, who became a national hero aged 25 by taking gold in the marathon in 1999. 

The marathon, which begins and ends at the Kim Il Sung Stadium was opened up to foreigners for the first time last April - the 27th time it had taken place. Organisers said that 27 countries were represented. 

The 2014 half-marathon was won by a Brit, Will Marks, who lives in Shanghai and was 30 when he claimed his victory. He crossed the finish line one hour and 33 minutes after starting.

He told MailOnline: 'It was as surreal as you'd imagine. After I finished we had to stand around in the heat for hours then parade around in the middle of the pitch with the anthems playing, then the North Korea minister for sports and some podium girls gave me the medal and a big daisy.'

Participants were warned that they were not allowed to display large writing on their running gear or carry country flags. They were also barred from carrying cameras and communication devices during the race - although some runners flouted the rules.

Foreign runners stayed in Pyongyang's Yanggakdo International Hotel and, like all tourists in the country, were forbidden to leave to roam freely. 

Mr Marks added: 'They had a microbrewery and virtual golf and a karaoke place the size of a nightclub with nobody in there. Really weird amenities.'

He said that foreign competitors got on well with the locals despite the restrictions. Conversations about freedom or North Korea's apalling human rights record, though, were shut down quickly by officials hovering nearby.

'The officials were very professional and actually had a good sense of humour,' he said. 'Some guys in our group asked them some controversial questions about the state and freedom, then the officials reverted to a script and it was clear there was a default response they were required to give.' 

Champion: British runner, Will Marks, won the amateur half marathon in one hour, 23 minutes and 36 seconds

National spirit: Thousands of North Korean citizens adorned their formal attire and danced in the streets

Proud moment: Around 40,000 North Koreans filled the stadium for the event last April

Staff members at the hotel were not so friendly. Marks described them as 'robotic' and said that any request resulted in a 'resentful stare', even if the request was simply for an extra bottle of water.

He wrote on his return from Pyongyang last April: 'I asked for an additional bowl of rice and the waiter stared so ferociously at me that I got the impression I'd taken it directly out of his child's mouth.'

Before the race, Marks had to bow to huge posters of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-Il, and stand to attention for the national anthem. Then, watched by legions of locals in Mao suits, he ran in a shroud of smog which he realised was the result of an enormous coal-powered power station situated in the city centre. 

Another Brit, Will Philipps, who was 27 when he competed in the amateur full marathon, said he came second to last of the runners who finished. His time was just over four hours.

He told MailOnline: 'You start and finish in this packed-out stadium in front of about 40,000 people, with men dressed in workers overalls and women in traditional colourful dresses. It's like being in a movie.

'The hotel was fascinating. Every fixture and surface had this kitsch Soviet '60s feel like you see in old Bond films. It was a 20-story building on an island. It was comfortable, although we weren't allowed out at night.'

For next year's marathon, set to take place on April 12, up to 500 foreigners will be able to take part. Those seduced by the accordions on the recruitment video can sign up for a North Korea marathon trip at Koryo Tours' website for between £625 and £1,355, depending on length of stay.

The tours enter North Korea from China, so entrants will have to get there first, plus pay a marathon entry fee of around £64, £45 or £32 to take part in a full, half or 10km race respectively.

The Kim Jong-Un-approved version of the promotional video, with the A-ha cover recorded by The Pyongyang Gold Stars, was created by British-owned tour company Koryo Tours. 

Koryo Tour boss Nicholas Bonner told MailOnline that he'd be using his next trip to the country to congratulate The Pyongyang Gold Stars on their success so far with their A-ha cover.

He said: 'The North Korean instrumentalists were amazed to hear how popular their recording had become online but, still being without the internet, they had no idea just how popular.

Not so fast: Another British runner, Will Philipps (left), said finishing the race inside a packed stadium made him feel like he was 'in a movie'

Ceremony:Kim Jung-Il wasn't there to present the medal to Mr Marks, but he was presented it by the Minister for Sports and a girl who gave him a giant daisy

'We will be taking in the video and remix to show them when we visit early next year when the country re-opens for tourism.'

Tourists are currently banned from entering North Korea because of a move by officials to minimise the risk of ebola bring brought in. Authorities have said that the ban will be lifted in time for the marathon. 

The opening of the race to recreational runners is in keeping with the North's ongoing effort to earn cash revenue by boosting tourism, usually with group tours to major arts performances or attractions the North wants to show off. 

Under the watch of young leader Kim Jong Un, the North has been giving sports in general a higher profile.

Simple recreational sports facilities, such as outdoor basketball courts and roller skating rinks, have been popping up lately in Pyongyang and some other cities.

Mingling: British runner, Will Marks, told MailOnline that foreign runners got on relatively well with the locals

Formal affair: Thousands of Korean men, women and children lined the streets to cheer on the runners

Guarded: Security officials kept a close eye on proceedings during the country's 27th annual marathon

All aboard: The secretive state opened up the marathon up to foreign runners for the first time this year

Mixing with the locals: Mr Marks said he was welcomed by most members of North Korea but hotel staff were not so friendly. He described them as 'robotic' and said that any request resulted in a 'resentful stare'

Watchful gaze: Officials were watching the moves of the foreigners as they experienced the sights of one of the most secretive nations on earth

Bonner had some advice for foreigners hoping to emulate Jong's performance. 'Don't spend your time high-fiving the locals. I spent a lot of time stopping, as the locals all wanted to snap photos of us with them on their mobiles. It played hell with my time'.
