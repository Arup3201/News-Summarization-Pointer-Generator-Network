Commuting is – quite literally – a pain in the neck.

A fifth of the British workforce say their journey to and from work is leaving them with neck, back and muscle pain, a new survey has today revealed.

Those who commute by car are most affected, with 63 per cent of drivers reporting their commute leaves them uncomfortable.

This is compared to 11 per cent on the bus.

And for Londoners struggling on the tube and buses each day, almost 60 per cent claim their suffering would be lessened with just a little more space. 

A fifth of the British workforce says their journey to and from work is leaving them with neck, back and muscle pain. Commuters in London have it worst. Three quarters (73 per cent) feel that their commute contributes to aches and pains and more than half (59 per cent) claim more room would mean they suffer less

Cyclists and runners are among those least likely to feel any back or joint pain, with only six per cent and five per cent respectively saying they do.

Taking the train was found to be a good option, with only five per cent of riders reporting pain.

A poll, published today, found commuters in London have it worst. 

Three quarters (73 per cent) feel their commute contributes to aches and pains and more than half (59 per cent) claim more room would mean they suffer less.

Meanwhile, 16 per cent of people say their commute has got more crowded over the last two years, with one in eight (12 per cent) saying they believe if they had more space they'd suffer less joint pain.

However, of those who suffer from back and joint pain, almost half (48 per cent) don't consider their posture when commuting and only a fifth (21 per cent) make a conscious effort to stretch their back or legs whilst on their journey.

And it's not just the commute that's a problem – the poll found the average worker sits or stands in the same position for three and a half hours a day.

Driving hurts the most, with 63 per cent reporting their commute leaves them uncomfortable

Katherine Cran, a physiotherapist in London says commuting and then sitting in an office all day can damage the body over time.

She said: 'Commuting to and from work every day can have a profound effect on the body. 

'Over time and without the right care, this can lead to long term joint and muscle damage.

'I often see people with back and joint pain who sit all day at work and tend to sit or stand throughout their commute too.

'Incorporating physical exercise into your day, checking your posture and doing a few simple exercises can help make a real difference.'

In 2013, 31 million working days were lost due to back, neck and muscle pains according to figures from the Office for National Statistics – in fact, more days were lost to musculoskeletal problems than any other cause.

The poll was carried out by Bupa.

Katherine Cran, a physiotherapist at Bupa's Basinghall clinic offers advice for managing joint and muscle pain while commuting:

Movement is medicine: try to increase the amount of physical activity you do whether its during your commute, or by incorporating it into your day – this could include cycling to work once week or walking around the block at lunchtimes;

Drive comfortably: drivers need to make sure they sit in a comfortable position that's right for them - adjust your seat, back support and steering wheel to avoid leaning too far back or having to stretch to reach the wheel or pedals. You should also avoid placing pressure behind your knees;

Avoid prolonged sitting: whether it's on your commute or in the workplace, try a mixture of standing and sitting:

Hop off earlier: one of the easiest ways to make a significant difference when commuting is to get off one or two stops earlier to increase your physical activity;

Simple exercises: help keep your joints mobile and prevent stiffness by doing some simple exercises and stretches such as gently rotating your ankles, lifting your knees, extending your legs and rolling your shoulders.
