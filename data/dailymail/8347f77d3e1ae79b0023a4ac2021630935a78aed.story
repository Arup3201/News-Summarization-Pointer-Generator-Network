Dire warning: Richard Horton, editor of The Lancet, warned that patients will die because of healthcare reforms

Britain's health services will be thrown into 'chaos' by the Government's reforms and patients will die as a result, the editor of a prestigious medical journal warned today.

The editor of the Lancet, Richard Horton, called for a concerted campaign to overturn the Health and Social Care Bill, which finally completed its parliamentary passage this week.

The Government's 'reckless' move to introduce competition into the NHS will lead to a 'fragmentation and disintegration of services' that will hurt those in need, he said.

'We are about to see a phase of unprecedented chaos in our health services,' he told the left-leaning Red Pepper website.

'Those of us who opposed the Bill should not gloat as this confusion takes hold.

'People will die thanks to the Government's decision to focus on competition rather than quality in healthcare.

'The coming disaster puts even greater responsibility on us to overturn this destructive legislation and remove this undemocratic government.'

The bitter 14-month parliamentary battle over the coalition's NHS reforms finally came to an end this week after the Government comfortably fended off a desperate 11th hour attempt by Labour to delay the legislation.

MPs then approved the last amendments - leaving the way clear for Royal Assent to be granted before Parliament starts its Easter recess next week.

The NHS shake-up has threatened to drive a wedge between the coalition partners ever since it was announced by Tory Health Secretary Andrew Lansley.

It is intended to give GPs greater control over NHS budgets, reduce bureaucracy, and increase patient choice.

But furious opposition from professional bodies and Lib Dem activists led Prime Minister David Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg to take the highly unusual step of 'pausing' the legislation last year.

Despite accepting more than a thousand amendments - including limits on competition and private sector involvement - the Government has failed to win over many health workers.

In the same piece on the Red Pepper site, Dr Jacky Davis, a consultant radiologist and BMA member, complained about a 'failure' of leadership by professional medical bodies who did not prevent the coalition proceeding with its shake-up.

'Early and united opposition would have seen off the Bill long ago,' she said.

'Instead our leaders, in trade unions and professional bodies, saw 'opportunities' and decided they could work with it on our behalf.

'When they were finally persuaded to see the dangers, their policy changed to seeking "significant amendments", despite the fact that the Government showed no sign of conceding any.'
