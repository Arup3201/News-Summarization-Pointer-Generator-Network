Ashton Kutcher has entered the firestorm surrounding under-fire taxi-hiring app Uber and defended controversial comments made by an executive who suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists who criticize the company.

Kutcher, an investor in the app, took to Twitter on Wednesday to show his support for beleaguered VP Emil Michael and described Sarah Lacy, a female journalist who has been highly critical of the company, as 'shady'. 

'What is so wrong about digging up dirt on shady journalist?' tweeted the celebrity tech entrepreneur who has invested in tech firms including Skype, Foursquare, Airbnb and Spotify through his venture capital firm A-Grade.

'So as long as journalist are interested and willing to print half truths as facts... Yes we should question the source' he continued in a series of tweets before he sought to clarify that he was speaking for himself and not Uber.

'This should be fun... Here comes the part where journalist explain why they should be exempt from ridicule and judgement and probing...' he continued.

The actor's attempt to defend Uber quickly provoked a negative reaction from many Twitter users who accused him of only getting involved because he was an investor in the company and of unfairly describing Lacy as shady for reporting facts about the service.

'A journalist harassed by a company you invested in. Nice' tweeted @tiedtiger.

'What makes her shady?' wrote @KeenPOV. 'Pointing out how some Uber drivers are sexual assailants?'

Not long after Kutcher decided it might be best just to apologize. 'U r all right and I'm on the wrong side of this ultimately. I just wish journalists were held to the same standards as public figures,' he tweeted.

In 2011, Kutcher was forced into an embarrassing climbdown after tweeting that the sacking of Joe Paterno as head coach of Penn State showed 'no class' and was an 'insult' to his legacy. 

Many people labelled Kutcher an idiot for his view and after a barrage of complaints he deleted his tweet and recanted his stance.

'This is an insane story, I just heard paterno was fired, getting the rest of the story now... Wow,' he wrote. He added: 'Heard Joe was fired, fully recant previous tweet! Didn't have full story. #admitwhenYoumakemistakes'

Kutcher's Uber comment come a day after Emil Michael was forced to make a grovelling apology over his controversial comments. 

The senior vice president was speaking at a private dinner in Manhattan on Friday, when he said that he had dreamed up an eight-man team who would find out about writers' personal lives and families so that Uber could discredit them.

The sinister scheme - which was targeted at a Silicon Valley editor who has savaged the company for its alleged 'sexism and misogyny' - drew an outraged backlash when it became public.

A chorus of disapproval aimed at Michael prompted a humiliating public apology to Sarah Lacy, the editor of PandoDaily, in which he disowned the idea entirely.

Michael posted an apology to Lacy's Twitter account, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly. My comments were wrong and I deeply regret them.

'Neither me [sic] nor my company would ever engage in such activities. Again, I apologize.' 

The remarks will do little to improve Uber's fragile relationship with the media following the portrayal of its management team as insensitive and aggressive toward customer complaints.

And, indeed, the apology did not stop Lacy from writing a scathing opinion piece on PandoDaily, in which she said the plan was 'like a five-year-old pretending to be Frank Underwood' - a reference to Kevin Spacey's scheming politician character in Netflix series House of Cards.

According to Lacy, Michael also called her cell phone and ask to speak in private, but hung up after she refused to have an off-the-record conversation. 

The dinner party in question was hosted by Ian Osborne, ex-adviser to British Prime Minister David Cameron and consultant for Uber

Michael's plan came up when he was asked about the firm's negative press coverage.

Venue: During the dinner party at Manhattan's Waverly Inn (pictured), Michael was reportedly asked about the firm's depictions in the press and responded that Uber should consider hiring researchers to snoop on writers

In response, the executive suggested that Uber should consider spending 'a million dollars' of its reported $15 billion worth on hiring four researchers and four journalists, according to BuzzFeed.

The eight-strong hit team would investigate 'your personal lives, your families' with a view to discrediting journalists behind unfavorable reports on the taxi service, he said.

Michael was especially focused on Lacy, who also recently accused Uber of 'sexism and misogyny' on her Silicon Valley website, writing: 'The company simply doesn’t respect us or prioritize our safety.'

He reportedly expressed anger over her claims that, responding that women are far more likely to suffer assault at the hands of normal taxi drivers than Uber drivers.

He said Lacy should be held 'personally responsible' for any women who copy her and delete the taxi app, and are then sexually assaulted, it is reported

Apology: Michael, who used to work at Klout and also sits on a board advising the Department of Defense, later took to Twitter to apologize for his comments to Lacy herself, saying: 'I would like to apologize to you directly'

Contradicting his remarks: He added: 'Neither me nor my company would ever engage in such activities'

And in reference to a specific claim about Lacy's personal life, he said Uber's dirt-diggers could work covertly to expose and discredit her to others, adding: 'Nobody would know it was us.'

After being confronted about his comments, Michael, who has been at Uber for more than a year and was previously described as a 'top deal guy' by founder Travis Kalanick, later apologized.

In a statement to BuzzFeed on Monday evening, he said he believed he was speaking off the record and that his remarks did not reflect his or Uber's views.

'The remarks attributed to me at a private dinner - borne out of frustration during an informal debate over what I feel is sensationalistic media coverage of the company I am proud to work for - do not reflect my actual views and have no relation to the company’s views or approach,' he said.

'They were wrong no matter the circumstance and I regret them.'  

At no point during the dinner did Michael suggest the firm has already hired opposition researchers.

An Uber spokesman confirmed that the company does not carry out such research and has never considered doing it because it would be a 'clear violation of our privacy and data access policies'.

The event at Waverly Inn on Friday evening was attended by a number of high-profile figures, including actor Ed Norton and publisher Arianna Huffington.
