He has just become the most powerful military leader-elect to the most populous country in the world, and yet there are details that remain unknown about China’s new president, Xi Jinpig.

While it is known is that he is married to the honey-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music, Peng Liyuan, and they have only one child together, details of their daughter’s life are few and far between.

Their 20-year-old daughter, Xi Mingze, is currently attending Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, though little is known about China’s new First Daughter.

Power couple: China's new president Xi Jinping is married to Peng Liyuan, the syrup-voiced megastar of popular Chinese folk music

Ms Xi reportedly transferred to Harvard two years ago and is surrounded by Chinese security at all times

New home: Kappa Alpha Theta sorority's house is seen on the Harvard campus where she is said to often study

It is believed that Ms Xi has been studying at the Ivy League school since transferring in two years ago after going to school in China.

She studies under a pseudonym so as not to attract undue attention.

It is rumored that she is surrounded by a staff of Chinese bodyguards 24 hours a day.

The Washington Post reported last May that she joined Kappa Alpha Theta sorority and is described by peers at the school as 'studious and discreet.'

She often studies at the sorority house and speaks with unaccented English.

Her name, Mingze, denotes innocence 
and ‘moral probity,’ Asia Time noted in 2007, speaking of how Xi’s 
ascent into China’s highest office could see a sort of parallel to the 
White House in terms of a father showing affection for his wife and 
children.

She isn’t the only progeny of China’s 
political leaders to attend the American institution. Bo Guagua, the 
only son of embattled politician Bo Xilai, also attended the institution
 and had a playboy ‘princeling’ reputation while at the school.

Ms Peng has become China's first high-profile political spouse since Jiang Qing, the late wife of Chairman Mao Zedong.

Her huge success in the entertainment industry has run alongside her staunch loyalty to the Communist Party.

She joined the People's Liberation Army aged 18 and rose to the rank of major-general, a post she still holds.

But
 when her superiors discovered her talent for singing, she began touring
 army bases serenading troops in a program designed to boost morale.

The Peony Fairy: Ms Peng had graced television screens in the world's most populous country for more than a decade, her honeyed tones punctuating state-run TV shows and Communist Party rallies

Get used to this face: Xi's inaugural address as the country's new leader was broadcast on giant screens across China. Here, above a McDonald's in Beijing

From
 there her rise to fame was meteoric. She is best known for performing 
at CCTV's New Year's Gala - a show watched by hundreds of millions of 
people throughout China - almost every year since its inception in 1982.

Almost all of her songs are in praise
 of the Communist Party and frequently appears on state television to 
sing propagandist ballads with names including Plains of Hope and People From Our Village.

In June 2011, she was even appointed World Health Organisation Goodwill Ambassador for HIV/Aids and tuberculosis.

She has also shied away from 
appearing in public with her husband or talking about their relationship
 until recently, fuelling speculation that she may take a more active 
role in his presidency than any of her predecessors.

In

 home, I’ve never thought of it as though there’s some leader in the 
house.

Very little is known about Xi Jinping's upbringing - or his rise to power.

He is married to a popstar called Peng Liyuan who, for most of Xi's career, has been more famous than him.

Chinese often tell a well-known joke: 'Who is Xi Jinping? Why, he is the husband of Peng Liyuan.'

He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao.

But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison.

Xi
 was exiled to a far-flung, rural community of Liangjiahe, in Shaanxi 
province, where he lived in cave-dwellings and was forced to labour in 
the fields.

Little more than 100 miles from Beijing, it is one of China's poorest regions.

The family lived like peasants in a cave-like house carved out of the yellow rock formations that surrounded the village.

He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man.

After leaving Liangjiahe, Xi headed to the busy coastal provinces that form China's industrial heartland.

He quickly climbed the ranks to become the most senior party official first in Fujian, before Zhejiang and finally Shanghai.

There he developed the mind for business and economics that he is known for today.

Now
 with exports and the economy slowing, China hopes his skills can help 
get the nation back on track to overtaking America and becoming the 
biggest economy in the world.

'In my eyes, he’s just my husband. 
When I get home, he doesn’t think of me as some famous star. In his 
eyes, I’m simply his wife.'

But while hers is still one of the most 
famous faces in the country, comparatively little is known of her 
husband, a man who spent most of his teens living in a cave, labouring
 in the fields of one of China's poorest regions.

He is the son of Communist revolutionary general Xi Zhongxun, a comrade of Chairman Mao.

But when he was in his teens, his father fell out with the Chairman and was sent to prison.

He is quoted as saying no problems he has encountered in political life compare to the hardship he suffered as a young man.

But he immersed himself in local 
politics and soon rose the ranks before today assuming the top posts in 
the Communist Party and the powerful military in a political transition 
unbowed by scandals, a slower economy and public demands for reforms.

Xi
 was introduced as the new party general secretary at Beijing's Great 
Hall of the People a day after the close of a week-long party congress 
that underlined the communists' determination to remain firmly in power.

The once-a-decade leadership change 
was carefully choreographed. It became clear Xi would lead China five 
years ago, when he was appointed to the Standing Committee - the 
nation's apex of power - as the highest-ranked member who would not be 
of retirement age this year.

Xi's
 colleagues in the new Standing Committee are Li Keqiang, the 
presumptive premier and chief economic official; Vice Premier Zhang 
Dejiang; Shanghai party secretary Yu Zhengsheng; propaganda chief Liu 
Yunshan; Vice Premier Wang Qishan; and Tianjin party secretary Zhang 
Gaoli.

In a speech 
broadcast live on Chinese state TV and worldwide, Xi said, 'We shall do 
everything we can to live up to your trust and fulfill our mission.'
