Daniel Parejo on Liverpool's radar after impressing for Valencia this season

Manchester City are considering Mehdi Benatia at Roma as their next centre-back purchase.

The
 Morocco star is widely regarded as the best central defender 
in Italy and has been watched closely by Manchester United, Chelsea and 
Arsenal in recent years.

Roma paid £12m
 to Udinese for him only last summer and he has continued to show why he
 is so well thought of with solid defensive displays and an attacking 
threat at set-pieces.

Sharp shooter: Benatia is considered one of the best defenders in Italy

Another option: City are also talking to French defender Eliaquim Mangala

City have been 
holding talks with Porto over Eliaquim Mangala who is generally regarded
 to be over-priced while there is a similar situation with Aymeric 
Laporte at Athletic Bilbao who Barcelona have also enquired about.

French-born
 Benatia is a proven quality player who would form a formidable 
partnership with Vincent Kompany while allowing the likes of Matija 
Nastasic to develop.

Benatia had a 
trial at Chelsea during Jose Mourinho's first spell at the club and 
stayed in a house with Didier Drogba and Claude Makelele. However, 
despite being offered a deal, he wasn't keen on such a big move at that 
stage of his career and stayed with Marseille.

Spurs set to offer veteran Friedel a new deal

Tottenham are poised to offer a new contract to Brad Friedel who turns 43 on Sunday.

The
 American has been a dependable figure at White Hart Lane and the club 
want him to continue as back-up to No 1 Hugo Lloris although they 
may yet recruit another keeper to also rival the Frenchman.

Evergreen: Brad Friedel could remain a Spurs player next season at the age of 43

Paris Saint-Germain, among others, remain keen on Lloris and Tottenham have an 
interest in Cardiff City's excellent goalkeeper David Marshall as do 
neighbours Arsenal.

Tottenham's Brazilian keeper Heurelho Gomes said his goodbyes to team0mates this week and will be free to find another club.

Baggies turn to Gardner

West
 Bromwich Albion will look to agree terms with Craig Gardner over the 
coming days. The 27-year-old officially left Sunderland this week. It is
 understood his house is up for sale and he has already moved back to 
the Midlands area. West Ham remain keen on Gardner's former team-mate 
Jack Colback but Newcastle and Everton have also discussed a potential 
move for the 24-year-old.

Burnley keen on Wigan midfielder McArthur

Wigan midfielder James McArthur is among the players wanted by newly-promoted Burnley.

Manager
 Sean Dyche would prefer to recruit players with Premier League or 
English experience and McArthur is a player ready to step back into the top flight after missing out this summer. Everton manager Roberto 
Martinez is also an admirer.

Premier chance: James McArthur could be back in the top flight next season with Burnley

McArthur, 26, has two years left on his 
current deal and Wigan may not sell cheaply but will recognise the 
player's desire to play in the top flight. A bid in the region of £5m 
plus add-ons could set the ball rolling.

Meanwhile, Everton's Greek striker Apostolos Vellios has left the club at the end of his contract.

Dutch star Strootman on United's radar

Manchester United remain interested in a move for Roma midfielder Kevin Strootman.

The
 Holland man is out of the World Cup after damaging knee 
ligaments but Louis van Gaal is still keen on recruiting the 24-year-old
 to his new squad.

Strootman was a target for David Moyes while he 
was playing for PSV Eindhoven and Moyes was Everton manager.

The Scot 
was keen to take him to Old Trafford, too, this summer ahead of William 
Carvalho of Sporting Lisbon. Strootman's injury in March means he will 
miss the start of the season but could be fit by October.

Roma would 
want a considerable profit on the £15m they paid last year but talks are
 ongoing between his representatives and interested parties.

Meanwhile, Juventus have rekindled their interest in United's Patrice Evra.

The
 33-year-old will be offered a two year deal and is willing to accept 
knowing that Luke Shaw will arrive at Old Trafford from Southampton 
after the World Cup.

Fifteen-year-old Mastour set for Milan debut

AC Milan are often heralded for their 
ability to prolong careers with the applied science of Milan Lab, 
however, all eyes this weekend are on whether they will give a debut to 
15-year-old Hachim Mastour.

The promising forward has been drafted 
into their first team squad amid interest from other top Italian sides 
and joined training on Tuesday. If Mastour makes his debut against 
Sassuolo on Sunday, he would become the club's youngest ever player.

He
 would also become the fifth youngest player to appear in Italy's top 
flight, behind Amadeo Amadei, Gianni Rivera, Aristide Rossi and Guiseppe
 Campione.

Mastour already has over 36,000 followers on Twitter and 
almost 400,000 likes on Facebook, where he regularly posts videos of his
 tricks. Nike have already agreed a 10-year contract while he also has a
 sponsorship agreement with Red Bull. He turns 16 next month.
