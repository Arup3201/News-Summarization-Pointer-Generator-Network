Eilidh Child was taught to hurdle by her older sister using a pair of cones and a stick in the driveway of the family home in Perth. It was in the grander surroundings of Zurich’s Letzigrund Stadium that the groundwork paid off with a European championship.

‘I owe Iona a lot,’ she said after the 400m hurdles final.

Taking a gold medal back to Scotland, to go alongside the silver she won at the Commonwealth Games, is a fine demonstration of gratitude to the elder sister who first coached her over the obstacles as a 10-year-old. Child described her vitory as a ‘complete relief.’

It was the first major championships final where she was expected to win, as the fastest qualifier and by being the best in Europe this year.

‘I was feeling the pressure,’ she said, ‘Anything other than winning it and I’d have been disappointed. I was quite nervous but I managed to calm myself and did what I had to do.’

The 27-year-old started strongly, clearing the second hurdle easily and putting her foot down to move away from the field with four hurdles left. She began to tire coming off the final hurdle but dipped to cross the line in 54.48sec, holding off the fast finishing Ukrainian, Anna Titimets.

‘I just tried to get to that line as quickly as possible,’ said Child, ‘My legs were dying all of a sudden and I was about five metres out and everybody came alongside me. I didn’t really know what had happened when I crossed the line. Obviously the Commonwealths meant a lot because it was at home but to actually have my own title now and be European champion is the best feeling ever.’

Winner: Gold medalist Child said her sister had first taught her to hurdle 

Child, who was a part-time PE teacher at Perth Grammar School until 2011, praised her coach, Malcolm Arnold, for helping get her mentally ready after the hype of being the Glasgow 2014 poster girl.

Now she hopes to be given a place in today’s 4x400m final after the team of Emily Diamond, Kelly Massey, Victoria Ohuruogu and Margaret Adeoye advanced third quickest. ‘It would be nice to add another gold to the collection,’ said Child. Then she has a couple more Diamond League races before her punishing eight- month season ends in September.

Lynsey Sharp ran the fastest 800m of her life but she was outsprinted in the final straight by Maryna Arzmasova. Sharp, 24, led until the final 60m when the Bulgarian, who beat her own personal best by more than a second, charged past.

Afterwards, she collapsed into the arms of her mother, Carol. ‘I’m gutted,’ she said, before bursting into tears, ‘I just don’t know if I did the right thing.’

Sharp has adopted a new confident, front-running style. She said: ‘I knew I had a fast race in me but that’s the most uncomfortable way to race, running scared the whole way and I knew in that field someone was coming — it was slightly suicidal.’

There was no fairytale double for Jo Pavey, the 40-year-old mother of two who won the 10,000m title this week. She did not have the speed on the final lap, finishing seventh in the 5,000m.
