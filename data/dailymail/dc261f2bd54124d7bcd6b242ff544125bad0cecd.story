Passengers on European British Airways flights will soon be able to keep on top of their emails, check Facebook and stream films thanks to the introduction of high-speed in-flight broadband

The airline hopes the partnership with satellite firm Inmarsat will help it push ahead of rivals with the lure of super-fast and reliable internet across European airspace.

It is thought the service could begin on domestic UK routes within three years before being rolled out across Europe, but how much it will cost has not yet been announced.

From 2016 European British Airways flights will be kitted with high-speed Internet provided by London-based satellite firm Inmarsat. The company will be launching a satellite in 2016 to provide the service, which is expected to bridge the gap between airborne WiFi in the UK and the U.S. (stock image shown)

A similar service in the United States, called Gogo, costs £3 ($5) per hour or just under £10 ($17) for a card with 24 hours loaded onto it.

Following the mysterious disappearance of Malaysia flight MH370 in March, Inmarsat announced last month it is going to track flights free of charge to prevent such a disaster happening again.

A total of 11,000 commercial passenger planes will be monitored and followed by the satellite firm, which helped reveal the last position of MH370 in March.

In addition, the firm will also provide a ‘position reporting’ tool in case flights veer off track, and a so-called ‘black box in the cloud’ to track real-time data remotely.

This remote black box is triggered automatically if the plane deviates off course, or communication is lost, and also sends historic recordings to a team of experts.

Inmarsat’s service additionally streams cockpit voice recordings.

This service is being offered to planes which are already equipped with an Inmarsat satellite connection, which the firm claims is ‘virtually 100 per cent of the world’s long haul commercial fleet’.

Europe lags far behind the U.S. where WiFi is already widely available to air travellers.

But Inmarsat plans to spend up to £270 million ($450 million) to bring Europe up to speed with passengers across the Pond.

About half of the money will be spent on launching a new satellite called Europasat, to beam WiFi down to planes in the air.

It will share the cost with French-Italian space group Thales Alenia Space and expects the satellite to be ready for launching into orbit by 2016.

Inmarsat also plans to build a network of 300 ground stations across Europe’s 28 countries over the next six years, using the same 4G broadband technology as the latest smartphones do.

It said the 4G ground network meant on-board WiFi could be as fast, reliable and cheap as the internet people use at home, for the first time in Europe.

British Airways will test the service on domestic routes at first, before rolling it out across Europe, where it operates 600 flight per day on about 130 planes.

It already offers a limited internet and text message service on its transatlantic business class-only London City to JFK New York service.

And the airline last year became the first in the UK to allow passengers to use electronic devices during take-off and landing, after European rules were relaxed.

Kate Thornton, head of product and service at BA, said the airline could soon be ‘leading Europe in a new era of broadband in the air’.

Conservative MP David Willetts, Minister for Universities and Science, welcomed the partnership between two leading British firms.

‘Today’s announcement is an important investment in new infrastructure that will promote productivity and growth in the UK and across Europe,' he said.

Meanwhile, Inmarsat boss Rupert Pearce said he expects in-flight WiFi to be a ‘multi-billion dollar’ industry by 2020.

He hopes to do deals with other European airlines, with British Airways set to be the first to get its hands on WiFi in mid-air.

‘Inmarsat 
will deliver high-speed mobile broadband to the seat back or to the 
passengers’ own mobile device, whether that’s a laptop or a phone or a 
pad throughout Europe,’ he said.

‘This transforms the potential for connectivity for aircraft flying around Europe.’

Pricing
 would be decided by the airlines, Pearce said, and passengers could be 
charged by capacity or per flight, or monthly for frequent flyers.

‘It’s going to be at a rate that is commensurate with terrestrial services,’ he said.
