The extinction of large mammals including a five-tonne sloth, has caused the Amazon rainforest to grow more slowly than it did, according to scientists.

Research into how soil nutrients are spread throughout the Amazon basin has shown there is a shortage of certain minerals, including phosphorus, because animals are now smaller and produce less waste to fertlise the earth.

The rainforest used to benefit from copious amounts of waste produced by South America's 'mega fauna' - large animals that roamed the rainforest thousands of years ago.

Scientists from Oxford University believe the absence of large herbivores, such as ground sloths and glyptodonts, which were a little like supersized armadillos, has helped cause the imbalance of soil minerals.

Christopher Doughty, who wrote the study published in Nature Geoscience, said the shortage of minerals created by a lack of mega fauna is having a big effect today.

He told The Independent: 'The Eastern Amazon in particular is 
phosphorus-limited which means that if you added phosphorus to the 
region the trees there would grow faster.'

'When you had big animals roaming more 
than 12,000 years ago, there would have been wider dispersal of minerals
 such as phosphorus and the trees there would have been growing faster 
than they are today.'

Ground sloths are a diverse group of extinct sloths, in the mammalian superorder Xenarthra

The term 'ground sloth' is used as a reference for all extinct sloths because of the large size of the earliest forms discovered, as opposed to the extant 'tree sloths'

Ground sloths had been extinct on the mainland of North and South America for 10,000 years or more

The study said that around 98 percent of nutrient-dispersal has disappeared since the mega fauna died out, which was roughly at the same time humans lived in South America.

While minerals are carried to the rainforest floor from the Andes via the Amazon river and its many streams, they are not always widely distributed and tend to collect in muddy soil in the flood plains.

However, this was not always a problem as the ground sloths and mega fauna fertilised the soil with their manure tens of thousands of years ago.

They used to wander the rainforest, carrying minerals essential for plants to higher ground, while their dead bodies also provided food for the forest, according to Dr Doughty.

He told The Independent the research proves the extinctions of these ancient animals affects the area today and that the larger the creature, the bigger its role in spreading nutrients, which helped the environment thrive.

Dr Doughty said: 'Most of the planet’s large animals have 
already gone extinct, thereby  severing the arteries that carried  
nutrients far beyond the rivers into  infertile areas.'

The scientists likened the wandering mega fauna in the rainforest to arteries in humans that carry essential nutrients to where they are needed.

The Amazon has been under threat from deforestation for years and this man-made action is preventing the spread of nutrients even more.

Fertilisers used on the land by farmers and the act of keeping livestock in pens also stops the dispersal of minerals in the region.
