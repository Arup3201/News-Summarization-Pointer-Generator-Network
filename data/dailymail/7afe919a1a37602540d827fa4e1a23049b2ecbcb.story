A 12-year-old boy has admitted committing more than 20 crimes in only two months, ranging from sexual assaults to stealing a model car.

The youth's crime spree also included a racially-aggravated beating, harassment, thefts and trying to break into a car.

The 21 offences were carried out in Portsmouth and neighbouring Southsea, in Hampshire, between May and July this year.

The boy's crime wave began on May 9 when he stole chewing gum from a branch of Tesco.

His offending became more serious in June, however, when he began a spate of assaults.

On June 7 he stole a remote control car from model retailer Modelzone in Portsmouth.

He assaulted a woman in Southsea a day later.

The boy carried out a racially-aggravated assault in Southsea on June 9 and carried out another attack in the town five days later.

On June 14 he tried to steal a scooter and ended up damaging it, causing a £70 repair bill.

Two days later the boy committed six offences in only 24 hours, including assaults in Portsmouth and Southsea.

In the fortnight that followed, he carried out racist offences, sexually assaulted two women and attacked another woman.

On July 1, the boy assaulted a man and tried to damage his Rover car.

The boy's campaign of offending ended on July 4, when he assaulted a man in Portsmouth.

Details of the crimes were heard at Fareham Youth Court.

District judge Anne Arnold told the boy: 'I’m going to remand you back into the custody of the local authority under the same conditions you had before.'

Under his bail conditions the youth must stay out of certain parts of Southsea and not contact four other people.

He is also subject to a curfew from 6pm to 5am.
