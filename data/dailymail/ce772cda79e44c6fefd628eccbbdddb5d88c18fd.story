Dozens of children were kept in a school hall and missed their lessons for their first day back at a city comprehensive - because they turned up wearing the 'wrong' shoes.

Parents Maria Gordon and Paul Cummings from Fairwater, Cardiff, say their daughter, Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils to be kept out of lessons for the day after she turned up to school in her usual black canvas footwear.

Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff, insists that letters were sent out in July explaining trainers and 'daps' - rubber-soled canvas shoes - were not acceptable. But Courtenay's parents claim they never received their copy.

Shoe ban: Courtenay Cummings, 13, was among 30 pupils kept out of lessons for the day at Cantonian High School in Fairwater, Cardiff

'They were kept in the hall like prisoners,' said shop worker Mr Cummings.

'Courtenay has been wearing shoes like that to school for the last two years.

'She wore them in year seven and eight with no problem and we've had no letter from the school or head teacher about it.

'They said they'd sent a letter but we had none.'

He said his daughter told him that at the first assembly of the year last Tuesday a teacher checked pupils and children with the wrong shoes. They were then taken to another hall, where they sat all day, except for dinner time.

The case echoes other uniform crackdowns across the UK this term.

Last week, around 100 pupils aged 12 to 16 were given their marching orders just minutes after turning up for the first day of term at The Coseley School, Bilston, West Midlands, because their footwear were not 'black, leather shoes' and were 'inappropriate'.

And sixty children were banned from classes on their first day for wearing the wrong trousers at Heaton Manor School in Newcastle. Pupils as young as 11 were put in ‘isolation’ for up to seven hours because they did not adhere to a strict new uniform policy. 

Laura Rawsterne, 12, who suffers from a foot complaint was forced to write 'decent people take pride in their appearance' 40 times after turning up to Excelsior Academy in Newcastle, Tyne and Wear on Monday, in the wrong shoes. 

In the latest case in Cardiff, Courtenay's mum claimed the school did not ring her or her husband at home or work.

'It's ridiculous. We know they can't wear trainers but these are black, lace up, canvas daps. She's a very responsible 13-year-old and she was very upset. We were not notified on the day and neither was our work.

'Courtenay enjoys school and what annoyed her is she didn't know what she'd done wrong. They were kept in a hall on a hot day. It's disgraceful.'

Headteacher Lois Spargo was not available for comment but in a statement the school said: 'The school, as with all other schools has a uniform policy to promote pride and identity among the pupils.

Sole reason: The rubber-soled shoes that the 13-year-old girl wore to school

'All parents and carers were reminded at the end of the last academic year of Cantonian's school uniform policy which clearly states that black shoes and not trainers, daps, boots or sandals should be worn.

'At the beginning of the current academic year there were a small number of instances of pupils not wearing the correct school uniform, including shoes.

'In each case the school made attempts to speak to the parents so the situation could be rectified.

'Pupils were asked to sit in the hall while the school attempted to contact parents.

'The hall is a bright, airy room with large windows and it is used for both Assemblies and some lessons.

'All pupils had access to all the facilities of the school as needed, including the school canteen, toilets, etc. We are glad to report that all pupils are attending all lessons.'
