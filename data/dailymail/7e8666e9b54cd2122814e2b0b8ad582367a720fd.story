It is a timely reminder that nature still often has the edge over technology.

A drone owner in Cambridge was flying from his quadcopter when a hungry hawk passed nearby.

Unintimidated, the hawk attacks - and downs the drone in one fell swoop.

Look out! The moment a hawk attacks a drone over a Cambridge park, bringing it to the ground - although both parties eventually escaped unscathed.

The incredible video was filmed over Magazine Beach Park in Cambridge, Massachusetts. 

Software developer Christopher Schmidt has been taking his Phantom FC40 quadcopter drone out into public areas to fly it around the skies, and often uploads footage to his YouTube channel.

To capture 1080p video during his weekly flights, Schmidt uses a GoPro Hero 3+ Black attached to his quadcopter drone.

However, last weeks flight took an unusual turn.  

'I was flying my quadcopter at Magazine Beach Park in Cambridge, when a hawk decided he wasn't too happy with my invasion of his airspace,' Schmidt said.

As the bird gets closers, its talons get ready to 'hit' the drone

After the attack, the drone falls to the ground, and the hawk flies off

The GoPro camera captured the hawk swooping in from above and slamming into the drone.  

In the video, the drone is filmed falling to the ground where it lands upside down on a grassy area of the park.

'As far as I could tell, the hawk came out unscathed, and having defeated his prey, was happy to retreat,' Schmidt said.

'As soon as he flew at me, I throttled down the props to try to minimize any harm to the bird.

'The quadcopter came out unscathed as well.'
