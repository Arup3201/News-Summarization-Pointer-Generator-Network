Hiding her face behind a silk scarf, sunglasses and her long blonde hair, Mayka Kukucova is escorted from a Slovakian police station.

The 24-year-old model was finally in custody yesterday in her native country four days after the shooting of her millionaire British ex boyfriend on the Costa del Sol.

Kukucova had been on the run but stunned officers on Tuesday by handing herself in at a station close to her parents’ home in a small Slovakian town.

She now faces extradition back to Spain accused of killing her former boyfriend Andrew Bush, who was shot twice in the head on Saturday at his £2,500 a month villa.

Gold dealer Mr Bush, 48, was found dead in a pool of blood at his five-bed rented home near Estepona just after 3am.

His new girlfriend, Russian student Maria Korotaeva, 20, told detectives his Slovakian ex was waiting for them in her pyjamas inside Mr Bush’s mansion when they arrived for a long weekend from the UK.

She took refuge in Mr Bush’s Hummer while he argued inside with the alleged killer.

Miss Korotaeva said Kukucova was ‘crazy’ with jealousy after Mr Bush ended their relationship.

She said gunshots rang out before the Slovakian fled the house and forced her out of the car to make her escape.

Kukucova, who had posted intimate videos online begging Mr Bush to take her back, was arrested on Tuesday in Nove Mesto nad Vahom in her home country - more than 2,000 miles from Spain.

Kukukova handed herself in and has since been transferred to cells in Trencin, Slovakia, where she was photographed early yesterday morning.

Officers carried a Louis Vuitton handbag for the model, as she shielded her face behind a large scarf.

Despite her dramatic trip home and a night behind bars, she appeared to have made an effort with her appearance.

Wearing sheer black leggings, £300 Gucci trainers, and a top with elaborate detail, she kept her face hidden behind a scarf and large sunglasses, which she wore inside.

Her father Lubomir Kukuca, 50, said his daughter kept in touch with them while she was on the run.

Mr Kukuca is seriously ill with cancer, so it is thought the model wanted to see him before she was arrested.

Miss Kukucova’s mother Danka, who supports the family as a manager for a local building society, said: ‘I don’t want to speak before my daughter does.

‘No one can imagine what we are going through at the moment.

Korotaeva described Kukucova (pictured) as a 'snake' and branded her an 'uneducated psycho'

‘We are really struggling. We are upset with what is being said about our daughter.’

It is thought Kukucova drove across several unmanned borders to reach central Europe.

It is also possible, however, she may have flown to Slovakia on an ID card before an international arrest warrant was received by her home country.

Friends in Slovakia suggested she may have evaded police with the help of her new boyfriend Peter Kucharik, a bodybuilder in his 20s who works for an armed security firm.

Mr Kucharik has not been seen at work since Saturday, when friends said he was trying to get to the airport.

His phone has been switched off since and his boss told the Mail no one had been able to get hold of him.

It is not yet known when Kukucova might be extradited.

Extraditions usually take a week, but they can happen in as soon as 48hours, according to experts.

There are fears Slovakia could try to block Kukucova’s return to Spain but under EU laws this would be very difficult and diplomatically disastrous.

Long journey: Kukucova was arrested  after giving herself up to police in her home town of Nova Bosaca in Slovakia. The town is 3,102km (1,928 miles) from the crime scene in Estepona, Spain

Kukucova is expected to be taken straight to court in Estepona on arrival in Spain after being booked in at a local police station for routine checks.

A judge in charge of the probe will then decide whether to release her on bail or remand her in custody while a full-scale investigation into Mr Bush’s violent death continues.

Mr Bush’s Russian lover flew to the resort of Adeje in Tenerife yesterday to be comforted by family.

After Kukucova’s arrest, she wrote on Facebook: ‘Yesssss!!!! Justice!!!!’

Earlier, she wrote: ‘My angel, my teacher, my LOVE..the perfect Man.

‘I still think it’s not true, it’s a film, it’s a dream. Not real. I love you baby and I know you will be looking after us from there.’

She said Kukucova was a ‘poisonous snake’ who was madly jealous after breaking up with her older lover and felt it had to be ‘her or no one’.

Mr Bush’s family have said they are ‘absolutely over the moon’ that Kukucova is in custody.

Slovakian police declined to comment yesterday.

A spokesman for Spanish police said: ‘A woman wanted for questioning in relation to an incident at Cancelada near Estepona at the weekend has been arrested in Slovakia on foot of an international arrest warrant.’

She has taken to twitter and Instagram today to praise Mr Bush, calling him her 'teacher' who 'changed my world for better [sic.]'

According to Miss Korotaeva, Mr Bush couldn't stand to hear Kukucova's name and his family resented her

Samantha Mason, who has a 19-year-old daughter with Mr Bush, is thought to be comforting Miss Korotaeva

Police have now recovered the Hummer which Miss Kukucova is believed to have fled in, but are still hunting for a Slovak woman in her mid-20s
