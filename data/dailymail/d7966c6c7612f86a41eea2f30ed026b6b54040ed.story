Manchester United have completed the signing of Salford City trialist and ex-Manchester City teenager Sadiq El Fitouri.

Sportsmail revealed last week how the 20-year-old right back, who only joined Salford in December, had impressed United staff during a game between United's Under 21s and first-team fringe players.

Adnan Januzaj, Darren Fletcher and Victor Valdes were among the stars to feature in that match, with El Fitouri standing out.

He has continued to impress in training, so much so the Red Devils have offered an 18-month deal.

El Fitouri is understood to have been initially recommended to United by Salford City joint owners Paul Scholes and Phil Neville, after the duo gave him his debut for the Evo Stick Northern Premier League side in a 2-1 win against Kendall Town on January 3.

Gary Neville, also a co-owner at Salford, hailed brother Phil and Scholes on Twitter for giving the youngster the opportunity to showcase his talent when he made his Salford debut a little over three weeks ago.

He said: 'Incredible story on @salfordcityfc on Sadiq El Fitouri. Well done to Phil and Scholesy for showing belief in a lad who was out of the game!'

On the move a delighted El Fitouri told www.manutd.com: 'This is honestly a dream come true for me and I have to thank Salford City for the chance, as well as the faith they have shown in me.

'I am really looking forward to what happens next and to be given the opportunity to do so at Manchester United is unbelievable.'

It caps a remarkable turnaround for the youngster, who apparently fell out of love with the game when his chances of breaking through into the professional game looked unlikely. 

Although he won't necessarily jump straight into Louis van Gaal's first-team squad, El Fitouri will help boost numbers and quality in Warren Joyce's Under-21 set-up. 

The Libya-born defender has connections in the game, with his brother Hamam on the books at fellow Premier League outfit Burnley.

United boss Louis van Gaal  has bloodied various youngsters into the United team this season and El Fitouri could be another one in the near future
