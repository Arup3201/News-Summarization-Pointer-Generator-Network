We saw a passing master class from Toni Kroos in midweek for Bayern Munich, but Michael Carrick had one of his own on Saturday.

He completed 135 passes against Palace, the most by any player this season.

And, as his touch map shows, he dictated play from all over the pitch.

Arsenal had a tough time against Bayern last week. They put in a great shift with 10 men but would have been disappointed to concede that late second goal.

Their performance against Sunderland was the perfect response. They played with confidence and scored some excellent goals, particularly Tomas Rosicky.

Arsenal are only a point behind Chelsea and that shows how far they have come in the space of a year.

At this stage last season they were fifth, 21 points off the leaders. And don’t forget it was an away win in Munich that sent them on that fine run at the end of last season.

Didier Drogba against Chelsea in the Champions League this week is a mouth-watering prospect and you can be sure that Jose Mourinho will be playing more mind games than ever.

Mourinho will try to soften up his former striker, calling him the best there’s ever been and saying he wishes he was still at the club.

He’ll be doing that to try to take the intensity out of Drogba, to tame the animal inside him and make him feel like he doesn’t want to score against his old manager and club.

You can be sure that if the tie is close going into the second leg, Mourinho will wait around in the tunnel at Stamford Bridge and give him a little cuddle to try to soften him up.

Jordan Henderson's transformation has been incredible and the player deserves all the credit. Brendan Rodgers didn’t seem to think he was ready for a starring role when he took over from Kenny Dalglish and often left him on the bench at the start of last season.

But Henderson has turned it around. I’m told he’s one of the best trainers at the club and his attitude has helped him come through those tough times.

After another two goals at Anfield, he deserves all the praise he gets. Very few people saw this coming. Dalglish got a lot of criticism for spending £16m on Henderson but it looks like money well spent now.

Former Real Madrid sporting director Jorge Valdano said last week that Gareth Bale was under pressure at Real Madrid with the emergence of Spanish starlet Jese.

He didn’t look that bothered as he fired home this brilliant goal on Saturday night. That was the best way to silence his doubters. Have some of that, Valdano.

Watch out for Virgil van Dijk. He could be coming to a Premier League ground near you. I’m a big fan of Celtic and the way they play and, in the 22-year-old defender, they have a real star on their hands.

He’s technically very good on the ball, is a brilliant defender and has a great stature about him. At £2.6m, he was a real bargain and a lot of top teams will be looking at him.

Man United are looking for a Nemanja Vidic replacement and Man City need a regular partner for Vincent Kompany. Van Dijk would fit the bill for either team. Going to Celtic was a clever move for him because it’s a great club to prove your qualities — just ask Henrik Larsson. 

Celtic will know there will be plenty of suitors in the summer. If he does leave, though, it will certainly be for a lot more than £2.6m.

There was a lot of big business done in the transfer window but one of the deals that went a bit under the radar was Joseph Yobo moving on loan to Norwich. 

It was a great deal, particular when you look at the big money spent elsewhere on players. Yobo was fantastic at Everton and he already looks like he’s striking up a good relationship with Sebastien Bassong.

When he moved to Fenerbahce he became a bit of a forgotten man but he’s a top player with plenty of Premier League experience. 

He has helped keep clean sheets against Man City and Tottenham now and it’s those kind of performances and results that could be the difference between Norwich staying up or going down.

Chris Hughton has been under huge pressure recently, especially when the club released a list of his potential replacements. Let’s hope results like this stop them going to press again.

After Saturday’s loss, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer might be thinking: ‘What have I done here?’

Fulham have already had three managers in three months and, with Vincent Tan as chairman, you can’t rule out the same happening at Cardiff.

Losing 4-0 to Hull is not a result that should be happening if you want to survive in the Premier League.

Teetering: Ole Gunnar Solskjaer could only wince and watch his Cardiff side lose 4-0 at home to Hull

That’s no disrespect to Hull. They 
were magnificent, particularly Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic, who 
already have a great understanding.

But Cardiff are in trouble. It’s in Solskjaer’s nature to be attacking, but he went a bit far with his line-up.

With
 three wide men in a very attacking midfield they left themselves open. 
You need to shore things up at the back before you can start going at 
teams in this league because, when you’re at the bottom, organisation is
 the priority, goals come second.
