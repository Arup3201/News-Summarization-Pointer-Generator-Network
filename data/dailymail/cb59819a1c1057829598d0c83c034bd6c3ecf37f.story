Arsene Wenger could see the question coming just as clearly as Danny Welbeck was able to watch Mesut Ozil’s cross onto his boot for his first goal in an Arsenal shirt.

Can similarities be drawn from the way Wenger re-invigorated the career of Thierry Henry and that of the player bought from Manchester United for £16million on transfer deadline day?

‘Give me some time,’ Wenger smiled as he enjoyed his team’s 3-0 victory at Villa Park. ‘It is a bit early to say that when you look at the number of goals Thierry Henry scored.

Arsenal fans will be hoping that Welbeck follows in the footsteps of Gunners legend Thierry Henry

‘I think he has an interesting potential and let’s see how he develops. He has a good mentality, good physical potential, good technical potential.

‘He contributes to our team play because he doesn’t lose the ball up front and those are important qualities.’

Henry was a striker, about to turn 22, struggling on the wing at Juventus before arriving in north London and getting the centre forward role he desired. Welbeck is 23 and left Old Trafford because opportunities up front were so limited.

‘Yes, he is a good act to follow, you know. I have nothing against it,’ Wenger agreed.

Clearly one sound finish does not an Henry make. The Frenchman scored 226 goals, won two Premier League titles and earned numerous individual accolades as the talisman of Arsenal’s team in the early 2000s.

But the signs were encouraging as Welbeck started his third game in succession as the sole striker. Never in his time at United was he entrusted in such manner.

Against Manchester City and Borussia Dortmund, Welbeck missed two excellent chances from similar positions – hitting the post and dragging a shot just wide – but Wenger made the point that by being given a run his confidence and accuracy would improve.

Besides, he is happy his last-minute purchase is getting scoring opportunities at all. It took Henry eight games before he found his first Arsenal goal.

Welbeck has the athleticism and pace that can stretch defences in the way Henry did and also possesses the touch you would expect from a player brought up through United’s academy.

His pass for Ozil’s opening goal was one the German would have been proud of himself, slicing the ball between Ciaran Clark and Philippe Senderos with perfect weight. (An Aly Cissokho own goal was the third scored in three minutes and 15 seconds.)

The area Welbeck can improve comes with his decision-making when given time to think about a finish, as that chipped shot when through on Manuel Neuer against Bayern Munich last season illustrated. It is why Louis Van Gaal said Welbeck’s scoring statistics were not up to the standard expected at United.

Wenger described how he must gain that instinctive knowledge for where to place a finish and challenged his striker to adopt an ‘animalistic’ temperament.

‘I think it is not a question of potential it is more a nervous problem because in training he scores goals like a real striker,’ Wenger explained. ‘He rushed a bit his finishing until now maybe because he didn't score.

‘He has played at Manchester United in the position wide for the last two or three years, never through the middle. You lose a little bit that instinct to score and as well that pressure which is a little animalistic to score. 

'You need to always be in the middle and wait for your chance to kill the opponent. On the flank you have less of that responsibility.

‘He was not soft. He did a different job, he worked up and down and provided for others. Selfish is a word I don’t like. I like a striker who gives the ball when he has to give the ball and scores when he can score. The fact he can provide and can score for me is very important.’

That link-up play is what makes Welbeck’s fee seem so reasonable and were he to get 20 goals this season his price would be regarded as a bargain. That remains to be seen, of course, and when Olivier Giroud returns from injury Wenger will have a decision to make.

This is the time Welbeck needs to make his mark. He is predicting better things to come. ‘I’ve not really had much time to get together with the boys and have many training sessions,’ said Welbeck. 

‘Once I carry on training much more and get into the matches I will develop a much better understanding with the players. That instinctiveness will come.’
