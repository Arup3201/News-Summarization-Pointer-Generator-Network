'Huge pressure': Theresa May has ruled out setting a formal target to cap Britain's population at 70 million

Theresa May yesterday ruled out setting a formal target to cap Britain’s population at 70million.

The Home Secretary spoke out as MPs debated a motion calling for government action to reduce net migration sharply. The motion was passed without a vote.

The debate was held  after more than 140,000  people signed a Downing Street e-petition entitled ‘No to 70million’.

Official forecasts say that, at current rates, the UK’s population will climb from 62.3million to 70million within 15 years.

Net migration – the difference between the number of people entering the UK, and those leaving – is currently more than 200,000 a year. Mrs May said she was determined to fulfil the Government’s pledge to cut net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’.

But she told MPs: ‘I have never been one that believes governments should be setting a figure in that sort of sense.’

During the debate, led by Labour’s Frank Field and Tory backbencher Nicholas Soames, a string of MPs warned of the huge pressure unprecedented levels of immigration were placing on public services.

Tory Andrew Turner said that, under Labour, ‘the number of migrants allowed into this country was far and away in excess of what we needed for economic growth’.

Climbing: If the UK's population continues to rise at its current rate it could reach 70million within 15 years
