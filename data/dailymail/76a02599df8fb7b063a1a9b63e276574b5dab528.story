Two-year-old Charlie Salmons sparked a massive rescue effort that saw his Melbourne bathroom demolished after four of his fingers became jammed in the drain of his bathtub

Firefighters initially cut a hole on the bathroom floor to release the drain from underneath the bath and when that failed they tried from the side of the tub.

Rescue crews were forced to hoist the entire bathtub off the ground after four hours of failed attempts.

'It was pretty worrying because he was all twisted. He had all his fingers twisted in there,' his mum Holly told Nine News.

'He was pretty tired and frustrated - he was saying he wanted to get out.

'They basically had to demolish the bath and then it was off to hospital.'

When Charlie was finally free of the bath, he was carried off to the hospital with the drain still attached to his hand.

'They had to contort one of his fingers really badly to get to the badly trapped finger and I was thinking maybe that finger was going to end up being broken,' Ms Salmons said.
