Passionate anti-vaccination campaigner Meryl Dorey has received a terrifying death threat, hours before she appeared at a health convention on the Sunshine Coast this weekend.

The lobbyist's controversial appearance at the Healthy Lifestyle Expo in Caloundra, Queensland, led to security being ramped up at the normally calm event.

Ms Dorey, who campaigns against immunising children, told police she had received a threatening warning on her Facebook page which read: 'Really ur gunn be dead soon b**ch'.

The person who left the comment did not hide their name and police say a charge could be brought against them.

Ms Dorey, who has no scientific or medical qualifications and previously claimed: 'I am not a doctor, but I have a brain', still attended the convention despite the threat to her life.

Her talk on Sunday was titled: 'Vaccinations: Do they really save lives?'

She told The Courier Mail she was the victim of 'medical discrimination'.

'It's always scary when people say they want you dead, you just never know who's actually going to act on that and who's behind the keyboard,' she said.

She also called for laws to be put in place to protect her medical beliefs, arguing we already have 'laws against racial vilification, sexual vilification'.  

In December 2012, the New South Wales Department of Fair Trading ordered the Australian Vaccination Network (AVN)- which Ms Dorey was then president of - to change its name or risk being shut down.

The move followed 'numerous' complaints from both the public and the Australian Medical Association that the AVN name was misleading the public and wasn’t an accurate representation of its activities.

The AVN claims to be pro-choice and a 'vaccine safety watchdog'

However, t-shirts on the group's website seemed to promote more fierce objectives which rule out vaccinating children at all. One top featured the slogan: 'Love Them, Protect Them, Never Inject Them'.

The campaign group is now called the Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network but still uses the same initials, AVN.

Ms Dorey got involved with the group after her eldest son was allegedly adversely affected by DPT and MMR vaccines administered when he was a child.

She is now the Public Officer and spokesperson for AVN.
