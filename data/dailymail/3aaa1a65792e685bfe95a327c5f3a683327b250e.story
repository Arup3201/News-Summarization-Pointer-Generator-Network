Silly hats, extravagant colours and brave prints were left at home last night, as Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie stepped out in London with their mother - and all three looked the picture of elegance.

Attending the Valentino:

Beatrice was out on the town for the second night in a row, having attended the British Fashion Awards on Wednesday night.

The Duchess of York opted for a black  sleeveless dress with ruffled neck, and black Aruna Seth black satin butterfly shoes, £595, while her daughter Beatrice, 24, chose a pretty cream frock with delicately embroidered detailing and black patent leather heels.

Younger sister Eugenie, 22, opted for a fitted navy dress with a black zipped jacket with puff shoulders.

Celebrities including Stella McCartney, 
Tamara Beckwith, Liz Hurley, Hurley's ex-husband Arun Nayer and Olivia 
Palermo also attended last night's opening of the new major exhibition 
celebrating the life and work of Valentino Garavani - as did the Italian
designer himself.

Aruna Seth is well-versed in furnishing famous feet, and counts those of the Duchess of York, both her daughters, Pippa Middleton, Kate Hudson and Pixie Lott among her most devoted.

The designer never says no to Swarovski crystal detailing, and even made a limited edition Union Jack pair bedecked with 3,000 of the little gems for the Queen's Jubilee, and priced them at £1,500.

Her butterfly shoes are the most popular, available in over 30 different styles and colours, and priced from £227.50 to £725.

The mother and daughter trio - who also managed to fit in a trip to Lou Lou's private members' club in Mayfair for the after-show party - spent time with the man of the hour, whose retrospective opens to the public today.

The glamorous exhibition focuses exclusively 
on haute couture created by the legendary Italian designer. With
a 50-year career starting in the late 1950s this exhibition will 
showcase over 130 hand-crafted designs worn by icons such as Jackie 
Kennedy Onassis, Grace Kelly, and Gwyneth Paltrow.

A prophetic designer and creator of exquisite, beautiful clothes, this is Valentino as he has never been seen before.

Featuring
dresses from the couture catwalk and red carpet as well as designs 
commissioned by private clients, this exhibition brings together a 
comprehensive collection of couture, much of which has never been seen 
outside the Valentino atelier.

The
exhibition will give visitors a rare glimpse behind the closed doors of
Valentino’s world, allowing them to experience the thrill of walking 
the runway and reveal Valentino’s craftsmanship.

Let's hear it for the girls: Princess Eugenie, left, and Beatrice, right, spent the evening with their mother the Duchess of York at the Valentino exhibition private view in London's Somerset House

Women in black: The young princesses and their mother looked elegant and sophisticated in dark jackets and knee-length dresses

'Each of these designs have a beautiful story,' says Valentino.

'The atelier crafted each so diligently by hand, taking hours, sometimes days to complete.

'The
details are incredibly intricate, though outside the runway shows and 
events, the dresses have rarely been seen, so to be able to showcase 
these designs at Somerset House, where they can be seen in great detail 
by the public, is very unique.'

Known
for his long-standing relationships with the world’s most glamorous 
women, Valentino has designed for princesses, first ladies and Hollywood

Speaking to Grazia magazine he said: 'When I first started there was only haute couture.

'I love the perfection of haute couture. I know the construction of each dress like the back of my hand.'

wore to marry Crown Prince Pavlos of Greece in 1995.

The
exhibition design for Valentino: Master of Couture has been created 
specially for Somerset House by internationally renowned design team 
Kinmonth Monfreda, long time collaborators of Valentino, and realised in
collaboration with Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti.

The exhibition has been curated by Alistair O’Neill for Somerset House with Patrick Kinmonth and Antonio Monfreda.
