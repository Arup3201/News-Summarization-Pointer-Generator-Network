A teenage schoolgirl spoke yesterday about how she was terrified when a fox jumped on to her chest as she lay in bed and bared its teeth at her.

Isobelle Barter, who lives with her parents at their home yards a recreation ground in Richmond, Surrey, was startled when she was woken and came face-to-face with a fox she thought was going to attack her.

The 15-year-old said: 'I was sleeping in bed and then heard noises downstairs and dogs barking so I thought it was our two dogs fighting.

'A couple of minutes later I hear another noise and thought it was my two dogs.'

It was 5am and the pupil was still half asleep when she realised a fox had crept into her room.

She told the Richmond and Twickenham Times: 'The next thing I know there was a fox in my face leaning over me with its teeth out like it was going to attack me.

'I just froze and then I started screaming and my dad ran in.'

The fox was locked in the bedroom before her father Jim chased it out of the house with a mop.

The teenager was so frightened her mother had to stay in her bed the following night until she fell asleep.

Her mother Helen Kisby said: 'I often see foxes walking down the alleyway but you don't expect them to jump into bed with you.

'The fox came up in through my dining room, up the stairs and into her bedroom.

'She said it was on top of her showing its teeth.

'It's like something out of Little Red Riding Hood.'

Animal experts said urban foxes sometimes enter people's homes because humans feed them as cubs.

Steve Barron, of Pest-go Limited, told the newspaper: 'I have heard of this happening before. It's not common, but it's not unheard of.

'What has happened is foxes have lost the fear of humans and they are extremely opportunistic so if they see an opening, they will go for it.

'They are losing their natural instincts of being wary and scared of humans.

'People should stop feeding them because what they learn when they are young, they will carry on until their later life.'
