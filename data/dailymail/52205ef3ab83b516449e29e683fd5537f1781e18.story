With its commanding position in the middle of a loch, this isle could be fit for royalty.

And its regal demeanour is completed by its name - King’s Island, translated from the Gaelic Eilean Righ.

Now you could own the charming piece of Scottish land off the Argyll coastline within Loch Craignish for the princely sum of £3million after a top City trader put it on the market.

It has been owned since 1999 by former Goldman Sachs market trader, Christian Siva-Jothy, who once enjoyed almost mythical status among the City’s financial community.

Stunning: King's Island, translated from the Gaelic Eilean Righ, sits around 300m off the Argyll coastline within Loch Craignish.

That all came to an end last year, when he closed down the $200million business he began after leaving Goldman Sachs and made a stunning confession about his ability to play the market.

Mr Siva-Jothy wrote to investors in his firm SemperMacro: 'In this business, you are only as good as your last few trades.

'Mine have not been very good.  Whether I have lost my edge or simply need a break after 23 years, I am not sure. I certainly hope it’s the latter.'

Mr Siva-Jothy’s financial misfortune may explain his sale of King’s Island, being handled by the Edinburgh office of estate agents, Knight Frank.

Certainly, prospective purchasers would need to be wealthy - with the island carrying a £3million price tag.

Yet its description suggests it may also provide a remote hide-out for a wannabe James Bond.

Getaway: The island boasts a totally refurbished four-bedroomed house, a helicopter hangar, boathouse, two slipways and jetty moorings

As well as a four-bedroomed principal 
house, the 238-acre island comes complete with a giant 500sq metre 
helicopter hangar, two slipways and a jetty.

Mr Siva-Jothy is a qualified helicopter pilot and would often fly one of his three aircraft from the island to his work in London.

He made his money as he watched the September 11 terrorist attacks unfold.

He said: 'The first thing I noticed on TV was that it was a perfectly clear blue sky day.

'I’m a helicopter pilot and I’ve been flying for 14 years. I know that when you’ve got a plane that’s going down, you don’t aim for the tallest building to fly into.'

He immediately bought eurodollars, capitalising on the plunge in consumer confidence and the collapse of many markets world-wide.

King’s Island has had a number of colourful owners over the years.  In the 1930’s, it was home to Sir Reginald Johnston, the retired tutor to the last Chinese Emperor, Puyi.

Sir Reginald built a Bhuddist temple on the island and flew the Manchukuoan flag in the Chinese-style gardens.

It later passed into the hands of a retired Indian Army officer, Lord Wilfred Brown andJames Waldegrave, the Viscount Chewton.
