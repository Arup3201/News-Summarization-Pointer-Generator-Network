Jordan Henderson required a slice of luck  after an uninspiring first half against Swansea, Jordi Amat’s sliding tackle sending the ball ricocheting on to his shin and ultimately looping beyond the reach of Lukasz Fabianski.

But there has been nothing fortuitous about the manner of his improvement over the past two years. He has blossomed from a player talked about in the same breath as Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam  - as examples of how Liverpool wasted the money from the sale of Fernando Torres - to England’s best midfielder.

Liverpool have not lost any of the 15 games where their vice-captain has worn the armband this season, winning 12 and drawing three, proving himself in the dressing room and on the pitch a worthy successor to the departing Steven Gerrard.

An incredible unbeaten run in the league stretching back to December has put Liverpool just two points behind Manchester United in fourth and Henderson has been the key to their revival.

Even when he is not playing well, as was the case against Swansea, the 24-year-old is a hub of industry, harrying the opposition and straining every sinew and devoting every ounce of energy to the cause. He also keeps popping up at the crucial moments - this was his third goal in as many games and a vital one which keeps the momentum going for his side.

Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher speaks of him as one of the best midfielders in the Barclays Premier League. Not bad for a bloke from Wearside who runs funny.

Legendary Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson turned down the opportunity to sign Henderson

That was the assessment of none other than Sir Alex Ferguson, who wrote in his autobiography that Steve Bruce, then Henderson’s manager at Sunderland, recommended United sign the youngster. Ferguson declined citing Henderson’s gait ‘might cause him injuries later in his career'.

Of course now he is just the sort of player Manchester United would want marshalling their midfield when the sides meet on Sunday in what could transpire to be pivotal in the race for the final Champions League spot.

Henderson laughed off Ferguson’s mean observation, even taking it as a compliment that the pair were discussing him. Over his career so far, he has demonstrated an enviable resilience and a thick skin.

When he first arrived at Anfield for £16million and failed to immediately deliver on the promise shown for boyhood club Sunderland he was widely, and understandably, maligned. Even Brendan Rodgers wanted to sell him to Fulham at one point.

Rodgers considered selling Henderson to Fulham but has been won round by the player's ambition

But Henderson won the Northern Irishman round with his desire and ambition and the two have struck up a good relationship. Henderson credits Rodgers' insistence that he work on his tactical nouse with his improvement. Gary Neville, who works closely with Henderson in the England set-up, has observed a big change in him in the last 12 months and praised his fanatical approach to working on set-pieces.

‘He has a massive conscience in terms of caring about his game and practising on the training ground,’ Neville said on Sky’s Monday Night Football. ‘I remember last year seeing a big change in him in terms of training and practising free-kicks and set pieces.

‘You saw him taking set-pieces with Steven Gerrard in the middle. Who would have thought that would happen two years ago? He is not frightened to pull people out and talk, that is why he has the captain’s armband. He is one of the leaders in the dressing room at Liverpool and he is the same with England.’

There may have been moments of luck along the way for Henderson but his story is one of perseverance and boundless improvement. Liverpool and England will hope there is even more to come.
