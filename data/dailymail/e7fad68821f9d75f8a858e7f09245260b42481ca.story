A mother whose daughter was strangled to death by her wealthy ex-boyfriend has revealed how she tormented the killer with handwritten cards in a bid to get him to speak about what he had done.

Deborah Edwards found her daughter, 32-year-old Dana Clair, in a pool of blood in her luxury San Antonio, Texas apartment after she was murdered in the early hours of New Year's Day, 2009.

More than two years later, Dana Clair's ex-boyfriend, Thomas Ford, was found guilty of strangling her and beating her beloved pet dog to death after he was unable to deal with their break up.

Speaking with 48 Hours Mystery, which recounted the often troubled investigation in a special episode,  Mrs Edwards revealed how she tormented Ford for the months leading up to his trial.

Murdered: Dana Clair Edwards, right, was found strangled in her apartment in January 2009, three months after breaking up with Thomas Ford, left, who was found guilty of her murder

On February 14, 2009, while Ford remained a free man, Mrs Edwards sent him a Valentine's Day card, with the words: 'I'm thinking of you.'

'I wanted him to know I was thinking about him and that he needed to think about me,' she said.

Another card read: 'Mother's Day - Never the same', while an email sent from her daughter's account read: 'How long were you planning this murder?'

'Remember how you ended her life' another card read, with a photo enclosed, with the words: 'Happy New Year. Dana Clair as a child.'

In the 2011 trial of Edwards, in which 
he was convicted and sentenced to 40 years in prison, defense attorneys 
attacked her for what they branded 'harassment' - but she stood by her 
actions.

Heartbroken: Her mother, Deborah, sent Ford a series of cards 'harassing' him after the murder

Unrelenting: She sent cards on special occasions 'so he knew I was thinking about him', she said

Demanding: Other messages were more direct, such as this email sent from Dana Clair's account

'What does a mother do when she's seen her daughter laying in a pool of blood?' she said.

She sent the letters as investigators and prosecutors began building their case against Ford, 43, who had dated Dana Clair for two-and-a-half years before she broke up with him in October 2008.

Following the break up, Ford, a well-educated man from one of the area's 'best' families, sent her letters describing his heartbreak and how he was unable to sleep.

'I need you to know that I am deeply 
saddened, hurt and disappointed at the sudden termination of our 
relationship,' he wrote on a card, dated October 1, 2008, shown at the trial.

'I just lie in bed crying over this 
tremendous loss and loneliness I now feel... I wish you would 
reconsider... You are the person I want to spend the rest of my life 
with and raise a family with!'

Killed: Two weeks after her death, her beloved dog Grits (pictured) was found killed and dumped in a field

Just before Christmas, Ford asked 
Dana Clair to his house to talk about the break up.

Mrs Edwards explained: 'She told me that it had been a really 
hard meeting. He was going on and on and crying and she was worried and 
she said, "Finally, I just had to leave, mother".'

But the two shared the same circle of friends and went to the same New Year's Eve party, although Ford left before midnight and claimed he was heading home.

His early departure came after he had been left upset by a game of word association, where two of Dana Clair's friends teased him after he was given the word 'marriage', they said at the trial.

Dana Clair left after midnight and returned to her condo complex.

Scene: She was found by her mother face down on the bathroom floor, pictured, in a pool of blood

But after she failed to pick up her 
family's dozens of calls on New Year's Day, they went to her apartment 
and found her lifeless body face down in the bathroom, with a towel over her 
head.

Arrest: Her ex-boyfriend, Thomas Ford, denied the murder but phone records placed him at the scene

'I opened the door and I yelled for Dana and there was no sound back and no dogs,' her father Darrell said. 'She was lying on the bathroom floor in a big pool of blood. And I felt her leg and it was cold.'

Her mother added: 'I kneeled on the floor next to her and pushed the towel off 
of her head and looked at her beautiful green eyes. I have no idea 
how long I was there. It was 'til the police made me get up and leave.'

Yet authorities initially believed she had slipped in the bathroom and ruled it accidental - until the autopsy found the cause of death was ligature strangulation.

Her apartment showed no signs of a robbery but a rolled up carpet, scattered belongings and smeared blood also raised alarm bells.

'When I heard, I just knew it had been 
deeply personal just because of the way the killing was perpetrated,' 
Dana Clair's friend, Cornelia Sawatzky, told 48 Hours.

Police turned to her heartbroken 
ex-boyfriend, who denied he had anything to do with the death and said 
he had immediately gone home to bed after the party.

But
grainy surveillance footage outside her condo complex filmed a white 
truck - like that belonging to Ford - waiting outside the building in 
the early hours of January 1. Footage also caught a person walking into her building after she arrived home.

In court: Ford, 43, was found guilty of the murder in 2011 and sentenced to 40 years in prison

Cell phone records also showed that, when he received calls that night, signal bounced off towers near her home, rather than his own, and placed him at the scene for more than an hour-and-a-half.

Records taken later that morning placed him two miles from her apartment, where Dana Clair's murdered Jack Russell dog, Grits, was found two weeks after her death.

Two of Dana Clair's friends also claimed they had gone to Ford's home after the party to drop off a beer cooler he had left behind, but did not see his car in his driveway.

And DNA on the towel also matched Ford's - yet his attorneys argued that he had been at the apartment as recently as 10 days before her death, so his DNA would be on her belongings.

It was not the only troublesome piece of evidence in the case. Investigators lost her fingernail clippings and the underwear she was wearing when 
she was killed.

Loved: Dana Clair Edwards' family remembered her as a loving sister and daughter committed to her pets

Breakdown: Ford had written her begging letters after she broke up with him after more than two years

They also misplaced clearer surveillance footage and instead had to rely on the grainier images, which did not even make the gender of the figure clear.

'There were 
points in the case that we were despairing, that we were depressed,' prosecutor Kirsta Melton said. 'We knew he did it... My biggest fear was that justice might not be done here.'

But at trial, Ford was found guilty of murder and sentenced to 40 years in prison.

'I guess what was a little bit of 
amazing was I could feel all my daughter's good memories come back to me
without Thomas in all of that,' Mrs Edwards said. 'I felt like I had her back.'

Thomas Ford is appealing his conviction. He will be eligible for parole in 20 years.

And for now, all her family can do is mourn the loss of the caring animal lover, sister and daughter.

'She was just always full of 
life and love,' Dana Clair's brother, DJ, said. 'The 
ultimate American girl.'
