Sunday night's AFC Championship game wasn't the first time that the New England Patriots have been accused of using illegally deflated footballs. 

The Indianapolis Colts first made the allegations during their game against the Patriots in November. The NFL said it was away of the problem prior to Sunday night's AFC Championship game. 

The NFL said it was 'aware' of accusations against New England prior to this weekend. 

The new report, which comes from ESPN, raises the possibility that the Patriots could have been cheating all season and got away with it until they were caught red-handed this weekend.

It has been alleged that 11 of the 12 footballs the New England Patriots in Sunday night's game were inflated 2 pounds per square inch less than league requirements

Referees swapped out the offending deflated balls at the start of the second half after the Indianapolis Colts complained

Now, the Patriots are headed to the Super Bowl to face the Seattle Seahawks on February 1. It is an unprecedented sixth Super Bowl appearance for quarterback Tom Brady and a chance to tie the all-time Super Bowl win record for head coach Bill Belichick. 

NFL officials told the Washington Post that the deflate-gate allegations were 'very serious stuff' and pledged that the league was acting swiftly to clear up whether the Patriots had used illegal balls.

Media reports say 11 out of 12 of the team's footballs were inflated two pounds less than the 12 and a half to 13 and a half pounds per square inch of pressure required by NFL rules. 

Each team is allowed to bring 12 of their own balls to every game and use those balls  

It has not been determined why the balls were deflated - whether this was caused by the temperature and conditions outside or whether the air was deliberately released. However, the NFL said the calls were checked by referees before the game and all 12 were at the legal pressure. 

Balls with lower air pressure are easier to throw and easier to catch - especially in cold and wet conditions. 

With the win, Brady is headed to a record-breaking sixth Super Bowl - and has the chance to win his fourth

Nearly all serious sports commentators believe that the Patriots 45-7 trashing of the Colts on Sunday night would not have changed much - or at all - if they had been using regulation balls.

However, many fans are furious about the new claims of cheating - considering Belichick has already been caught breaking the rules once before. In 2007, he and the team were fined $750,000 and docked a first-round draft pick after an assistant was caught filming opposing coaches giving signals to their defensive players. 

ESPN reports that during the Colts' November 16 regular season game against the Patriots, the Indianapolis equipment manager raised the question of whether New England was using illegal balls.

Colts safety Mike Adams intercepted two of Brady's passes and gave the balls to the Indianapolis officials, who found that they were 'significantly' deflated, sources told ESPN. 

Colts officials brought the issue to the attention of NFL officials at that time, according to ESPN. 

The Patriots won that game 42-20.
