For many fathers, the prospect of telling their sons about the meaning of life induces apprehension.

But when Francis Crick shared the secret of life with his 12-year-old son Michael, it was a hugely exciting moment. After all, he had just  discovered it.

A letter from the famed British  scientist to his son has come to light in which he describes his groundbreaking model of DNA weeks before it was made public.

discovery of DNA, has come to light

In the handwritten letter, tipped to 
sell for £1.5million, the biologist writes of having made 'a most 
important  discovery' at a research lab in Cambridge.

He would go on to win a Nobel Prize for his work, which revolutionised our understanding of genetics.

In the letter, Dr Crick explains in depth the DNA double helix structure, the so-called 'blueprint for life'.

He says: 'We have built a model for 
the structure of des-oxy-ribose-nucleic-acid, called DNA for 
short . . . In other words we think we have found the basic copying 
mechanism by which life comes from life.'

Dr Crick also drew a rudimentary diagram, telling Michael: 'Read this carefully so you understand it.'

He signed the letter, dated March 19, 1953, 'lots of love, Daddy'.

Dr Crick, who was from Northampton but emigrated to California, died in 2004 aged 88.

In the letter he explains in-depth the make-up and code of the DNA helix structure or the so-called blueprint to life. And he instructed Michael to carefully study the DNA structure so that he 'understood' it.

Michael Crick, now 72 and living in 
Seattle, kept the letter, and will sell it at auction in New York to 
mark 60 years since the discovery.

He said: 'My father believed that DNA 
contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared 
his enthusiasm with me.

'Everything came together in February 
1953 when my father and (fellow scientist) Jim Watson were given the 
go-ahead to try and construct a model of DNA.

'My father's enthusiasm could not be 
contained. The story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub 
called the Eagle and announcing to all who would listen that he had 
found “the secret of life”. Then on March 19 my father wrote to me 
describing the model and its implications. I was 12 at the time and away
at Bedales – the British boarding school.

'When I returned to Cambridge my father very proudly showed me the model.

'The excitement of the event was 
beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter 
summarising the discovery in seven simple pages.'

Mr Crick said part of the proceeds 
from the sale will go to an institute dedicated to brain research, 
another area in which his father worked.

Dr Crick carried out his research on  DNA with fellow scientists James Watson and Maurice Wilkins.

The three won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1962.

Attempting to put his work in simple 
terms, Dr Crick wrote to his son that DNA could be thought of as a 'very
long chain with flat bits sticking out, called the “bases”'.

He said: 
'We have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a 
helix – and the chain, made up of sugar and phosphorus, is on the 
outside and the bases are all on the inside.

'Now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together.'

The auction is being held by  Christie's in New York on April 10.

DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life.

Two Cambridge scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, first described its famous double-helix structure in 1953, changing the face of biology for ever.

The complete set of DNA instructions that makes us what we are is known as the Human Genome.

Within it, there are 2.9 billion chemical "letters". Certain sequences of these letters make up the genes, the "software" that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body.

Working out the entire pattern of DNA in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon.

A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder.

The sides of the ladder, made of sugar and phosphate molecules, are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases.

Four different bases are present in DNA, and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code. They are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G).

The two DNA strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand, forming base pairs.

Genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs. In the case of the human genome, the figure is 2.9 billion.
