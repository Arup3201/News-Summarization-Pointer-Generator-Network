It wouldn't be Paris Fashion Week 
without Karl Lagerfeld's exquisite Chanel show and, this year as ever, 
the French design house delivered a triumphant collection.

But it wasn't just Cara Delevingne and Miranda Kerr on the catwalk that caught the world's eye, it was hard to miss the A-list front row decked out in the classic Chanel staple: tweed.

The classic country chic style is tipped to be the season's biggest trend and is already being sported by fashion's most forward thinker, Anna Wintour, as well as models Kate Upton, Cara Delevingne, Miranda Kerr and Clemence Posey.

Chanel has a long history with the rough textured fabric and this season design maestro Karl Lagerfeld has reinvented the sumptuous classic this with a futuristic feel.

For spring/summer 2014, Karl Lagerfeld reinvented the classic with shots of metallic, pops of colour and with denim and leather.

Chanel's
love affair with tweed began back in 1924 when the house's eponymous 
founder Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel was holidaying in the Scottish 
Highlands, where she became influenced and inspired by the tweeds worn 
by her lover, the Duke of Westminster.

Famous fans: Kristin Scott Thomas (L) and Vogue editor Anna Wintour (R), were spotted sporting the tweed trend

Coco was a huge fan of tweed's irregularity and thus her signature style was born and has been carried through to the current season by today's creative director, Karl Lagerfeld.

Hip-length and boxy in style, the 
Chanel tweed Little Black Jacket was originally launched in 1954 when it was radically 
different from the nipped-in shape of the Dior jackets popular at the 
time.

Chanel’s woman was modern and emancipated and the style reflected this.

Her versatile tweed, braid-trimmed, 
silk-lined jacket sat just-so on the body, the bottom hem weighed down 
with a thin brass chain.

Variations on the 
same design are shown each season and sell for thousands - couture 
versions are still made at the fashion house’s atelier on Paris’ Rue 
Cambon.

Dramatic setting: The Chanel showcase at the 
Grand Palais in Paris featured huge plant pots, flowers and of course, 
the label's iconic logo and tweed

Speaking about this season's hottest trend, fashion blogger Lydia Faye Jones said: 'Tweed has always been an essential and classic fabric for any time of the year.

'Once again the classic Chanel tweed suit has been tweaked and revamped through the use of hot pink, multicoloured stripes and simplistic monochrome.'

Eleanor Robinson Head Of Buying at my-wardrobe.com, said: 'Tweed has been reworked for a/w 13.

'Pieces are sharp and structured, resonating of classic style paired with leather for a modern look.

'Choose from fitted skirts and jackets with nipped in waists such as a Carven Analea jacket, a playful take on a conventional style.'

Standing test of time: Coco (L) was a huge fan of tweed's irregularity and her signature style was born and has been carried through to the current season by current creative director Karl Lagerfeld

Lisa Potter, deputy editor of Femail Fashion Finder said: 'No longer the style choice of upper middle classes ladies
who lunch and men who go hunting, tweed has made a fashionable comeback thanks
to designers like Prada, Ralph Lauren and of course Chanel.

'Karl Lagerfeld's
Pre-Fall and autumn/winter 13 collections for the iconic label were full of the
classic fabric reworked into sharp little jackets and skirts, and his spring/summer 14 show this morning was a rainbow explosion of bubblegum pinks and fluorescent yellows, proving that the tweed trend is very much a modern affair.

'Jump on the spring summer trend early and give tweed a
technicolour update by exploring the texture in a kaleidoscope of colours or
keep it classic with a chic salt-and-pepper tweed jacket layered over an
all-black ensemble.

'Either way it's time to raid granny's closet.'
