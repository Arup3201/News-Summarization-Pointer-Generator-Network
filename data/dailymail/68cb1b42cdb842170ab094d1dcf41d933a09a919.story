This is the moment a bedraggled and emaciated cat was pulled from a car engine after being stuck inside for two weeks.

Princess was unwittingly driven around for hundreds of miles while trapped in her owner's BMW before she was discovered.

It was only after the pet clawed her way through a coolant hose - triggering a warning light - that owner Julie Tansley, 40, of Nottingham, realised where she had been.

The bedraggled moggy was hauled out of the engine bay of the BMW 1-series by its shocked owners on Wednesday

The mother-of-three, from Nottingham, had mounted a desperate search for her beloved cat after she went missing on May 7.

Unaware that the long-haired black cat was under the bonnet of her car, Ms Tansley drove her car as normal and even went through a car wash at one point.

But she couldn't believe it when she looked inside the engine and found the filthy moggy staring back at her.

Princess was wedged so firmly inside the engine bay that it took a whopping 45 minutes to get her out.

Ms Tansley, partner Trevor Lee, 46, and friends had to partially dismantle her black convertible in order to free the stricken cat.

Remarkably, Princess was not hurt and is already on the way to a full recovery.

Ms Tansley said the cat has acted like nothing happened since her ordeal ended on Wednesday.

She said: 'I had no idea where she had gone, then I was driving along and noticed the warning light came on the dashboard.

'I didn't know what the light actually was so I checked in the book and saw that it was coolant.

'We opened the bonnet and there she was, stuck inside the engine.

'I tried to get to her but I just couldn't, in the end I phone the guy who lives across the road because he owns a scrap yard.

'He sent around one of his mechanics to see what they could do.

'They had to take one of the headlights out and take other things out too before Princess could be reached.

'I have absolutely no idea how she managed to get there. It wasn't until I opened the bonnet I had any idea that she could be there.

'As you can see on the video she had no way of getting out of there by herself. It wasn't as if she was curled up lying down there either, she was stretching up on her back legs in there.

'If the warning light hadn't come on I dread to think what would have happened. 

'She was covered in horrible coolant when we got her out, we had to wash her down straight away.

The cat was very thin as it had been without food and water for two weeks. But the family said she's happily eating and walking around as if nothing happened

'She's alright now though, but she is really really thin as she hasn't eaten for two weeks, but she's happily eating and walking around as if nothing happened.

'Now we've got quite an expensive repair coming up, I don't know how but it seems she was so desperate to get out the clawed right through the hose.

'It has cost over £300 to replace that hose, so it's an expensive way to travel having your cat with you.

'It's just unbelievable, we took her all over Nottingham, I mean we've driven to and from school, work, even through the jet wash with her in there.'

A video of the rescue shows the family peeling back engine parts before attempting to coax reluctant Princess from the car.

Ms Tansley can be seen stepping in herself and hauling Princess out after she was unable to free herself.
