An 85-year-old Chinese grandmother got her arm stuck in a toilet for four hours after reaching in to fish out her false teeth.

Mrs Zhang was washing her dentures at around 9am on Wednesday when they slipped out of her hands and fell down the squatting toilet hole in her bathroom.

She could see them lying deep inside the lavatory, so reached in to grab them.

But as she tried to stand back up, she found her left arm was stuck in the hole.

Mrs Zhang desperately pulled and wriggled but her arm was well and truly jammed, forcing her to wait for her family to come home.

An hour later, her daughter-in-law came back to their home in Guangyuan, in Sichuan province, central China, to the bizarre sight of Mrs Zhang lying on the bathroom floor.

After failing to free her mother-in-law, she called the fire brigade for help.

They lubricated her arm with soapy water and slowly eased her out of the odd predicament. 

Finally, four hours after she dropped the false teeth down the toilet, she was freed. 

Mrs Zhang was not injured in the ordeal, but the fate of her dentures is not known.
