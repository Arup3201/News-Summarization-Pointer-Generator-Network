Middlesbrough are confident of beating promotion rivals Derby and Norwich to the signature of Blackburn striker Jordan Rhodes.

The 25-year-old is the nephew of Boro assistant Steve Agnew and that is thought to have played a part in the Scotland international favouring a move to Teesside.

Rhodes is set to join on loan before the weekend with a £8million permanent deal arranged for the summer, should he help Boro win promotion to the Premier League. Further clauses have been inserted should Aitor Karanka’s side then stay in the top flight.

The striker has an incredible goal-scoring record in the Sky Bet Championship and is an impressive coup

The Riverside club are concerned that their challenge is beginning to falter and see Rhodes – who has 13 goals for Blackburn this season and was a £12million target of Hull last year – as the addition needed to bolster their claims for a top-flight return.

Karanka’s men are one of four teams at the top tied on 66 points but sit at the bottom of that pack because of goal difference.

They have lost three of their last five with the club’s strikers coming in for criticism during that run.

Should the Rhodes deal go through then he could be in the squad for Saturday’s lunchtime visit of Ipswich Town.
