John Terry took a humorous dig at Chelsea team-mate Filipe Luis's choice of footwear on Twitter on Thursday.

Luis's plimsoles were ruthlessly exposed by Terry in reaction to some stick about the Chelsea captain's football boots. 

Terry posted: 'I can't believe @filipeluis tried giving me stick about my boots today, when he come in wearing plimsoles I used to wear for PE in school. Can you help settle a debate.

'My boots or his Rascals trainers? And he is lucky I'm not posting a picture of his road runner t shirt.'

Chelsea lead second-placed Manchester City by two points at the summit of the Premier League table. 

Mourinho's men travel to the Liberty Stadium on Saturday as they look to increase their lead over City.
