More than 100million Royal Mail shares were traded within 60 minutes of the former monopoly floating on the stockmarket yesterday.

Their price jumped instantly from £3.30, the sale price set by ministers, to £4.50, allowing critics to say the Government had chronically under-valued the business. The price closed at £4.55 – a 38 per cent increase on the opening price.

The 378-year-old company looks set to join the FTSE index of Britain’s 100 biggest listed companies, joining household names from BP to Prudential and Vodafone to Diageo.

Surge: Shares in Royal Mail soared by more than a third in early trading as the government faced claims it had under-valued the firm ahead of the controversial privatisation

Success: David Cameron, on a visit to Belfast, hailed the sell-off as a success and brushed off criticism that the firm had been under-valued

Last night, the company, which had been valued by the Government and its advisers at £3.3billion, was worth £4.4billion.

While
 the clampdown on small shareholders subscribing for shares was 
described as ‘unwise and unfair’, it emerged that some of Britain’s 
richest people tried to buy huge amounts.

It is understood 41 people who asked for £1million or more of shares were among 36,500 applicants who were given nothing.

Of
 the 690,000 people who bought shares in the business, many had sold 
within minutes of receiving them, making an instant pre-tax profit of 
about £250.

The 
‘unprecedented’ interest from private investors triggered meltdown at 
one leading stockbroker yesterday with its website working only 
intermittently because of the sheer weight of demand.

Despite installing a new server to bolster its computer system, Hargreaves Lansdown said the demand was ‘off the scale’.

The
 number of people working on its helpline desk was increased ‘six-fold’ 
to handle the calls from people, most of whom wanted to sell, rather 
than buy. Ian Gorham, chief executive of Hargreaves Lansdown, said the 
number of shareholders wanting to trade shares had ‘gone off any 
conventional scale’.

Some 
angry customers are understood to be demanding compensation over the 
technical problems. Last night, Hargreaves Lansdown said it took all 
customer complaints ‘seriously’.

Steven
 Fine, managing director of another broker, Peel Hunt, said he had 
‘never seen anything like it’ and described the number of people trading
 Royal Mail shares as ‘extreme’.

The
 demand would have been even higher, but shareholders who used the 
Government’s website to buy shares can not trade until their share 
certificate arrives next week.

Business
 Secretary Vince Cable stood his ground yesterday, dismissing the sharp 
jump in the share price as just ‘froth and speculation’. He said: ‘It is
 of absolutely no significance whatever.’

David
 Cameron also dismissed fears that the company had been sold at a 
bargain price. He said: ‘First of all, we should celebrate the success 
of the privatisation of this business.

‘It
 is not only good for its employees, who have become shareholders, it is
 not only good for the shareholders who now own this company, it is good
 for the company itself.

‘As
 for price, let’s see what happens in the days and weeks ahead. What 
really matters is this has got off to a very good start.’

But Labour leader Ed Miliband said: ‘It’s a fire sale of a great institution at a knock-down price.’

Ralph Bartholomew had never bought shares in a company in his life – until this week.

The 44-year-old from St Albans, Hertfordshire, who is married with two young children, said the chance to buy shares in Royal Mail seemed like too good an opportunity to miss.

He said: ‘It was my first-ever foray into the stock market.

‘As far as I could tell, it was going to be difficult to lose out.’

Mr Bartholomew, who works for University College London as a web designer, tried to buy £1,500 of shares but ended up with only the minimum amount of £750.

He was relaxed about not getting the full amount as he had worried that he might end up with nothing.

Yesterday morning he had not made up his mind whether or not to hold his shares or to sell them.

But as he watched the share price climb, he decided to sell at lunchtime.

He said: ‘It shot up so much, it was too enticing to not be more than £200 richer.

‘I knew I would not regret taking the money that was on the table.’

Mr Bartholomew sold his shares, which he bought for £3.30, for £4.30, making a tidy profit of £1 each. He made £227 before trading costs.

Dr
 Tim May, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association, which 
campaigns for small shareholders, criticised the way that the shares 
were allocated.

Everybody who applied for up to £10,000 worth of stock 
got at least 227 shares, but anybody who applied for £10,001 or more got
 nothing.

But ministers 
insisted it was the fairest way of dealing with the unexpected tidal 
wave of interest from private investors for a company which is one of 
the best-known brands in Britain.

The
 scale of the interest in Royal Mail shares was eye-watering. About 
£37billion, including £4billion from private investors, was chasing just
 £1.7billion of shares.

The 
Government triggered controversy by excluding any private investor who 
had asked for more than £10,000 of shares.

Instead, it gave 227 shares 
to everybody who had applied for £10,000 or less, equal to about £750 
worth of shares at the original price of £3.30.

Even the government was surprised by the level of interest in the privatisation of Royal Mail.

More than 700,000 people applied for shares, making it seven times over-subscribed.

Shares
 were initially priced at between 260p and 330p, but the stampede from 
investors means ministers have opted for the top price of 330p, which valued Royal Mail at around £3.3 billion.

However, as shares leapt to £4.50 in early trading, the government was accused of undervaluing the firm by more than £1billion.

The government is selling 52.2 per cent of the company, arguing private money is needed to ensure its future survival.

Royal Mail has had to adapt to changing demands, as we post fewer letters but more parcels as we shop more online.

'Conditional share dealing', where City institutions can buy and sell the shares, begins today.

Full trading will begin next Tuesday, October 15, when all investors including individual members of the public can buy and sell shares in Royal Mail.

Yesterday
 unions continued to bitterly oppose the privatisation, with a strike by
 postal workers expected to be announced next Wednesday.

Billy
 Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers’ Union, said the 
free shares given to workers, equal to 10 per cent of the business, had 
not changed their minds.

He added: ‘Shares will make no scintilla of 
difference to postal workers who are far more concerned about their 
jobs.

We expect our members will vote to protect their terms and conditions in our strike ballot next week.’

Small
 shareholders will have to wait until as late as October 21 to get their
 money back if they subscribed for more shares than they actually 
received.

They will not 
receive a penny in interest on the money, but the Government will 
benefit from the interest paid on the enormous cash pile, estimated to 
be £3.4billion.

Mystery 
surrounds the identity of City institutions who were allowed to buy 
shares.

Like private investors, many lost out, with 500 of the 800 who 
asked for shares being rejected. Shareholders do not have to disclose 
their stakes unless they own 3 per cent or more of a publicly-listed 
business.

In a move which 
will help Royal Mail keep its investors under the radar, not a single 
institution went over this threshold.

Mr Cable said only ‘stable, 
long-term investors’ were offered shares, with names such as Fidelity, 
Standard Life, BlackRock and Threadneedle known to have been successful.

David
 Jones, from financial spread-betting firm IG, said it was ‘somewhat 
archaic’ that so many of the shares had been sold to City institutions.

Of the 522million shares sold by the Government, 33 per cent were sold 
to private investors, but 67 per cent went to City institutions, such as
 pension fund managers and insurance firms.

He
 said: ‘Based on the interest in Royal Mail, it may give the Government 
pause for thought if and when they come to sell off chunks of Lloyds 
Banking Group in the future.

'There is demand from individual investors 
out there and maybe they should be offered a bigger piece of the pie.’
