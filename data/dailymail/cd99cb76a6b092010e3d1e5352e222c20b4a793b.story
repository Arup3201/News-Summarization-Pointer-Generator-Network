It beat 'twerking' to be crowned word of the year by editors of the Oxford English Dictionary and it seems that the power of the selfie shows no sign of abating thanks to image-conscious, social media-obsessed Brits. 

So obsessed are we with capturing the perfect snap of ourselves that, according to new research, over 17 million selfies are uploaded every week on social media. 

And thanks to beautiful celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley constantly showing off their perfect faces we are always on the hunt for new ways to perfect our own shots.

Testing, testing: FEMAIL writer Bianca London tested the Fearless Fuchsia shade of Avon's new lipstick in an office selfie

One beauty brand are hoping to capitalise on the demand for a stand-out selfie by launching a new lipstick designed to create a high definition, camera-ready pout with a pop of colour.

Avon Cosmetics has unveiled the Ultra Colour Bold Lipstick - their highest concentrated lipstick yet.

Available in 10 shades, the £7.50 lipstick is formulated with Avon’s new exclusive Pigment Loading Technology, which claims to give the wearer a 'highly pigmented bullet' and a lipstick that 'explodes with bold, bright colour'. 

The team behind the new lipstick discovered that no matter how vivid and bold the colour, lipsticks are generally obscured in pictures by an opaque base (the part of the formulation which carries the colour). 

The team identified that in order to create ‘true’ colour, which best harnesses the pigment’s potential, it was necessary to develop an entirely new base - one which is translucent - and the new product was born.

Lisa Lamberty, director of new product innovation at Avon Research and Development said: 'We created Ultra Colour Bold lipstick because we know women want deep bold colour to accentuate their lips and make them look their best in photos.' 

Liz Pugh, Avon’s professional make-up artist, added: 'Requests on how to create the perfect lip are high in demand this year and my top tip is that a bold lipstick can hide a multiple of sins. The high pigmentation in this draws attention to the mouth, a simple trick for an attention-grabbing look which doesn’t require layers of contouring or smoky eyes.

'I've been using it whilst on AW14 shoots. Magenta Flash and Bold Bordeaux in particular are excellent shades when trying to achieve this attention grabbing look.

'With just one application the lipstick provides brilliant bold colour which lasts for hours.' 

VERDICT: Team FEMAIL gave two of the new shades a spin and found that while they did enhance selfies, they were best saved for a night on the town rather than a day in the office.
