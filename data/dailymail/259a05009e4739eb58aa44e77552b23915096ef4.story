Samsung is believed to be preparing its own 'smart glasses' to take on Google.

The firm is expected to launch the gadget at a major trade show in Berlin in September, according to reports.

It is already the first major firm to launch a smartwatch, and could beat Google to market with the smart eyewear, as the search firm has so far refused to reveal when it will put Glass on general sale.
