Peering over a classmate's shoulder during a game of chess, this is the boy who would become the merciless terrorist butcher Jihadi John.

The image, exclusive to The Mail on Sunday, shows ten-year-old Mohammed Emwazi in his last week at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London.

The London schoolboy, who moved to the capital from Kuwait when he was six, was revealed this week to be the vicious killer known as Jihadi John who has featured in six ISIS beheading videos.

A former classmate said: 'I was horrified to find out the Mohammed I spent years with was this person.

'I don't know what happened in his life to turn him into this. This was the last week of Year 6 and we were having fun before going our separate ways.'

It has been claimed he was 'never the same' after suffering a serious head injury when he ran into a goal post as a child, according to a former classmate.

The executioner  agreed with Hitler's massacre of Jews and called them 'f***king pigs', another said.

While some former peers say they are struggling to believe the quiet boy they knew turned into one of the world's most notorious killers, others have spoken of a boy with extreme beliefs and a thirst for blood.

After moving to London, he appeared to embrace British life - playing football in the affluent streets of West London while supporting Manchester United.

But a former classmate at St Mary Magdalene Church of England primary school in Maida Vale, West London, told LBC: 'We were in the playground and Mohammed was running away from someone, I think he was just about to get into a fight.

'And as he was running, another guy blocked his path. And he ran into a goal post and hit his head on a metal goal post and fell to the floor.

'This was Year 6 - we didn't see him for six weeks. He was not the same ever since that brain injury. I am telling you one million per cent. He was not the same'.

A former friend of the terrorist, who met him in 1999 when they both attended Quintin Kynaston Community Academy in St John's Wood, North London, said he found out Emwazi was a Nazi sympathiser during a Year 9 lesson.

The 27-year-old told the Daily Mirror: 'The teacher told us the Nazis drew up plans to get rid of all the Jews.

'I heard Mohammed mutter "Good, they deserved it". I thought he was joking but later he told me that he hated all Jews and blamed them for the plight of Muslims.'

The school friend said that if they ever walked past a house in Golders Green that Emwazi knew was owned by a Jew, he would shout obscenities such as 'f***king pigs'.

These anecdotes appear to be reinforced by what details have emerged of Emwazi's adult life. Just over a decade after the picture of him at school was taken, he was pictured attending a hate-filled rally where one of the killers of Drummer Lee Rigby gave a speech.

Emwazi is said to have attended the demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in North-West London in 2009 to 'celebrate' the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

During the rally, which attracted at least 1,500 people, Michael Adebolajo spoke to the crowd of his contempt for 'unbelievers'.

Adebolajo - who is in prison for Rigby's murder - said: 'They are pigs. Allah says they are worse than cattle. Do not be scared of them. And do not turn your back to them. Don't be scared of them, or police, or the cameras.'

Onlookers said they also saw a tall Kuwaiti man, believed to be Emwazi, masked with a scarf, and holding aloft a black flag with the Islamic testimony of faith in Arabic.

The flag is usually associated with extremists and jihadis.

Scarce details of Emwazi have emerged in the past week after he was named as the notorious ISIS killer, but together, they paint a picture of a man tormented by run-ins with British security services as he became increasingly radicalised. 

It has now emerged Emwazi was involved with a violent street gang who targeted the wealthy residents of Belgravia with stun guns, and was a member of a secret Osama Bin Laden sleeper cell based in Britain called The London Boys, which planned to carry out atrocities in the West.

Other members of Emwazi’s cell include Ibrahim Magag, a Somali-born former train conductor from London involved in arranging ‘financial support for Al Qaeda’. Magag was put under a control order to stop him fleeing overseas to join a jihad. But on Boxing Day 2012 he vanished. Officials believe he went to join British jihadis in East Africa. 

All this occurred amid his beliefs he was being harassed by security services when detained at Heathrow Airport.

In a series of remarkable emails with Mail on Sunday journalist Robert Verkaik, he comes across paranoid that his every move is being shadowed by British intelligence officers.

The emails, sent in 2010 and 2011 before Emwazi travelled to Syria, offer a remarkable insight into his state of mind at a time when he was already deeply immersed in extremism.
