A mother has spent more than two years making edible  candles for her son's birthday cake.

Melissa Jarvis was inspired by celebrity chef Heston Blumenthal and made her creation from almonds and chocolate.

They were finished just in time so that her son, Aston, could be the first person to try them on top of a cake for his third birthday.

The candles are made from chocolate with a carved almond wick and took two-and-a-half years to make

The candles are made with an almond wick, which the chocolate-lover carved by hand.

Ms Jarvis, from Fareham, Hampshire, who is the managing director for chocolatiers Lady Chocolate. said: 'The most difficult bit is carving the nuts in a certain way so it opens the natural capillaries of the nut, which is what fuels the fire.

'It took a lot of food research and development to find something that would light.

'It took me two-and-a-half years of carving these nuts to get it right.

'In the last few months they were lasting long enough to use them as birthday candles.

The candles are home-made and don't have any wax in them so they are absolutely safe to eat  

'I wanted Aston to be the first person to have edible birthday candles.

'All parents want to be able to provide for our children. It's a really big driver for me, he's a chocolate expert.'

Although her inspiration, Heston Blumenthal, used wax for his, Ms Jarvis's home-made candles don't use any.

Ms Jarvis, a former PA, said: 'Over the two-and-a-half years of making them I've had to teach myself everything about the process.

'I think the whole concept is really great, edible candles mean you don't just have to stop after eating the cake.'
