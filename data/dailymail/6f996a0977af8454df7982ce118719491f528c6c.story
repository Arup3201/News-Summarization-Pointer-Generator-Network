In court: Susan Nicholson, 52, allowed children to live in a property littered with dog mess, rubbish, and infested with cockroaches

A woman allowed children to live in a property where dog mess littered the floor, cockroaches infested the rooms and rubbish covered the surfaces, a court has heard.

Susan Nicholson was responsible for the property in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, where police officers found dirty washing and rubbish lying around the house.

They also found perished food left on top of clothes and dog dirt in a bedroom.

The 52-year-old pleaded guilty at Gateshead Magistrates Court to three allegations of causing unnecessary suffering.

The court heard how Nicholson, who now lives in Bensham, Tyne and Wear, had already been told in 2009 to clean up her act.

Sarah Turner, prosecuting, said: 'Officers attended the address and they found certain conditions.

'They found rubbish, dirty washing, perished food and mold.

'On the second floor of the property there was dog excrement on the floor of a bedroom.

'There was also a cockroach infestation.'

Nicholson, who suffers from health 
problems, also pleaded guilty to three counts of assault, ill-treatment
and neglect of a child under the Children and Young Persons Act 1933.

She was sentenced to a 12-month community order with the 12 months' supervision and was also ordered to pay Â£40 court costs.

Charles Weidner, mitigating, said that Nicholson had pleaded guilty to the offences at the earliest opportunity.

Mrs Turner added: 'Mrs Nicholson accepted that conditions had deteriorated over some months.'
