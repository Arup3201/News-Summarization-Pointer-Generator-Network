An entire town has been destroyed and hundreds of homes burned to the ground after a fire ravaged a popular tourist area in southwest China this morning.

Fire engines were unable to put out the blaze in Shangri-La in Yunnan province, leaving residents no choice but to take to the narrow streets with buckets of water.

The fire was started accidentally in a guesthouse but quickly spread through the Tibetan area, destroying the tourist town of Dukezong in its entirety, according to local media reports.

The popular tourist area of Shangri-La has been destroyed by the fire which ravaged the ancient Tibetan town for more than ten hours

Fire engines were unable to access the town's narrow streets to battle the blaze, leaving residents and volunteers no choice but to fight it with buckets of water

The area is known as one of the best preserved Tibetan sanctuaries in the world for its prayer halls and typical houses that are predominantly made from wood

An estimated £10million of damage has been caused as a result of the accident according to state media reports. No casualties have yet been reported

More than 240 houses and shops have been burned to the ground, with more than 2,600 residents dislocated as a result of the accident which has caused an estimated £10million in damage according to state media.

Witnesses described being woken by the sound of a loud explosion to find the town, which is made up of predominantly wooden buildings, engulfed by flames.

'The fire was huge, the wind 
was blowing hard, and the air was dry,' said one resident, He Yu.

'I was scared because my home is a
 little distance away from the ancient town.

'It kept burning, and the 
firefighters were there, but there was little they could do because they
 could not get the fire engines onto the old town's narrow streets.'

The blaze was brought under control at around 11am this morning more than ten hours after it was started in the Dukezong guesthouse.  

The area was renamed in 2001 in reference to the fictional land of Shangri-La mentioned in the novel Lost Horizon by James Hilton in a bid to boost tourism

Shangri-La, formerly known as Gyaitang Zong, was renamed in 2001 to refer to the fictional Himalayan land mentioned in the novel James Hilton novel, Lost Horizon.

The region's old town, Dukezong, was renovated into a cluster of shops and guesthouses in a bid to boost tourism.

State media reports claim the fire was easily spread as the majority of buildings in the area were made from wood. Dry weather conditions and strong winds are also thought to have encouraged the blaze.

The town which is more than 1,300 years old is known as one of the largest and best preserved Tibetan sanctuaries in China.
