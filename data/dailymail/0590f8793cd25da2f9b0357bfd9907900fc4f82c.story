A New York Times investigation has found no evidence to support claims al-Qaeda or any other international terrorist organization had links to the 2012 storming of the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya.

The six-part report published Saturday instead blamed the poorly-planned attack on local extremists outraged by an American-made video mocking Islam.

The Times refutes claims made by many Republicans that al-Qaeda was involved in the attack despite Obama administration assertions to the contrary.

‘Extensive interviews with Libyans in Benghazi who had direct knowledge of the attack there and its context, turned up no evidence that Al Qaeda or other international terrorist groups had any role in the assault,’ the Times report found.

The 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi was carried out by attackers who directly benefited from NATO funding and arms supplied during the Arab Spring uprising against Muammar Gaddafi, the Times reported.

‘The attack was led, instead, by fighters who had benefited directly from NATO’s extensive air power and logistics support during the uprising against Colonel Qaddafi,’ the report continued.

‘And contrary to claims by some members of Congress, it was fueled in large part by anger at an American-made video denigrating Islam,’ it concluded.

These claims come after over a year of accusations the Obama administration was working to cover up al-Qaeda involvement in the attack, which resulted in the deaths of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three others.

Republicans took to talk shows and even held Congressional hearings on the matter, with House Rep Mike Rogers (R-MI) making al-Qaeda claims only last month.

‘It was very clear to the individuals on the ground that this was an al-Qaeda-led event,’ he said.

The Times' conclusion that al-Qaeda did not aid in the attack is bolstered by a surprising phone call made from a Libyan militant to a friend close to the terror group.

‘The only intelligence connecting al-Qaeda to the attack was an intercepted phone call that night from a participant in the first wave of the attack to a friend in another African country who had ties to members of al-Qaeda,’ said the report.

‘When the friend heard the attacker’s boasts, he sounded astonished…suggesting he had no prior knowledge of the assault,’ the report continued.

White House officials reached Saturday by NBC News predictably did not dispute the report’s claims.

These revelations come only one month after an embarrassing series of blunders in a 60 Minutes report on the attack alleging ties to al-Qaeda that forced a retraction of the claims and the suspension of correspondent Lara Logan.
