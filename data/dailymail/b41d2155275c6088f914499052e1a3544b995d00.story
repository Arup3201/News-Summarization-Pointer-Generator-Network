A recent study has suggested children with stressed parents are more likely to be fat as they get older

Stressed parents are more likely to have obese children, a study has warned.

Children whose parents have high levels of stress have a Body Mass Index, or BMI, about two per cent higher than those whose parents have low levels of stress.

They also gained weight seven per cent faster than other children, the Canadian study claimed.

Researcher Dr Ketan Shankardass warned if
 not stopped at an early age, weight gain will continue to lead to 
health problems later in the children's lives.

He said: ‘Childhood is a time when we develop inter-connected habits related to how we deal with stress, how we eat and how active we are.

‘It’s a time when we might be doing irreversible damage or damage that is very hard to change later.’

Dr Shankardass said it was not clear why the link between stress and obesity existed.

He said parents might change their behaviour when they were stressed, buying more ready meals or junk food to save time rather than preparing healthy meals. 

Parental stress could also have a knock 
on effect for the children, who in turn cope by eating more and 
exercising less, or whose stress leads to biological changes that cause 
weight gain.

The study by St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto, looked at 
data collected during the Children's Health Study, one of the largest 
and most comprehensive investigations into the long-term effects of air 
pollution on the respiratory health of children.

The childrens' BMI 
was calculated each year and their parents were given a questionnaire to
 measure their perceived psychological stress.

It asked how often in 
the last month they were able or unable to control important things in 
their life and whether things were going their way or their difficulties
 were piling up so high they could not overcome them.

Rather than 
focusing only on getting parents to change their behaviour, more needed 
to be done to support families such as making sure they have a reliable 
supply of healthy food or improving living conditions.

He noted that 
more than half the students followed in the California study were 
Hispanic, and that the effects of stress on their BMI was greater than 
children of other ethnic backgrounds. 

This was consistent with 
other research which has suggested that Hispanic children may be more 
likely to experience hypherphasia, excessive hunger or increased 
appetite, and sedentary lifestyle.

The study was published in the journal Pediatric Obesity.
