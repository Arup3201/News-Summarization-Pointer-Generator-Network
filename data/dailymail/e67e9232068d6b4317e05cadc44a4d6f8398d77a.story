A working men's club in the north of England is the world's biggest consumer of French Benedictine liqueur, downing 1,000 bottles a year of the alcoholic beverage.

The golden tipple has been a favourite at the Burnley miners' working men's social club for more than a century after being popular among soldiers who developed a taste for it during the First World War and drank it to keep warm.

Since then the drink has become a best seller at the 600-member club – which has even introduced a 'Bene Bomb' in a bid to keep it popular among the younger members.

Barman Dan Jakes pours Benedectine liqueur at the Burnley miners' working men's social club - the world's biggest consumer of the beverage where 600 members down around 1,000 bottles of the drink every year

The drink became popular in Burnley after soldiers from East Lancashire were drafted to Normandy in the First World War and developed a taste for it after drinking it to keep warm. Pictured: Members try the 'Bene Bomb'

Several members round off their evenings with a 'Bene'n'hot' - the liqueur served with hot water - while others take it on the rocks.

It has even been 're-branded' to appeal to the newest members of the club – by being mixed with an energy drink as an alternative to the infamous JagerBomb.

Club secretary Alan Kennedy said: 'The soldiers used to drink it in the trenches and the hot water obviously kept them warm but it also made it last longer.

'When the lads made it back they all wanted Bene'n'hot so in November 1918 they club managed to get 18 bottles delivered.

'It was difficult to get hold of but they managed it in then end. I think they had to order more before Christmas so it went quickly.

'They also drink it in Colne, Nelson and Accrington because the soldiers came from those areas.

'I don't know anywhere else that drinks Bene'n'hot but it's the most popular way to drink it here.

The club is the world's biggest consumer of the beverage with the majority of members enjoying it with water

The drink was discovered by the men of the 11th battalion of the East Lancashire regiment after they were drafted to Fecamp in Normandy - where it is made. They asked the club to import it on their return from the war

'Most of the members - about 60 to 70 per cent - drink the Bene'n'hot.

'A few would have Bene and ice and one or two will have a straight Bene at the end of the night.

'Most of the lads who come in here will finish with a Bene'n'hot at the end of the night.'

He added: 'Some of the younger ones are drinking it now, the 30 and 40-year-olds, so it is still popular.

'We have just started selling the Bene Bomb - like a Jager Bomb except with a shot of Bene in the energy drink.

'We've only just started with it but I reckon it will be popular one.'

The club has even dedicated an entire part of the clubhouse to the drink by unveiling the Benedictine Room

Benedictine liqueur features up to 27 ingredients, including an array of herbs and spices, such as Lemon Balm

The drink was discovered by the men of the 11th battalion of the East Lancashire regiment after they were drafted to Fecamp in Normandy - where it is made.

After being imported to the UK by the working men's club, it also became tradition for Burnley Football Club to sell the liqueur on match days, making it the only English club to do so.

Describing the spirit's unique taste, Mr Kennedy said: 'It has a peculiar taste all of its own but I think it is a taste between brandy and whisky.

'It doesn't have the heat of whisky and tastes sweeter. The hot water just makes it seem so palatable.'

In recent years, the drink has become so popular that the men's club has even opened a 'Benedictine room' especially dedicated to it.

Benedictine is produced at Fecamp in Normandy

According to legend, the recipe for Benedictine liqueur was invented in 1510 by Benedictine monk Dom Bernardo Vincelli.

However, it was developed by Alexandre Le Grand, with the help of a local chemist, in the 19th century.

The recipe is shrouded in secrecy and there are only three people in the world who currently know the complete recipe for making the spirit.

It is has been produced at the Benedictine Monastery at Fecamp on the coast of Normandy, France, since 1510. 

The monastery was destroyed during the French revolution and it has since been produced by Mr le Grand.

Benedictine features up to 27 ingredients, including an array of herbs and spices. 

Its three main ingredients are Angelica, Hyssop and Lemon Balm.

It is aged for up to 17 months before bottling and each bottle has the initials D.O.M. on the label - which stands for 'Deo Optimo Maximo' ('To God, most good, most great').

The Burnley miners' working men's social club is the world's biggest consumer of the liqueur, while Burnley Football Club is the only one in England to sell the beverage on match days.
