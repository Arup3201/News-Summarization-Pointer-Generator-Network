Temperatures at Stamford Bridge may have been touching zero, but there was a distinctly Brazilian feel about the Chelsea-Liverpool Capital One Cup semi-final.

When Jose Mourinho brought on Ramires for the injured Cesc Fabregas in the 50th minute, there were no less than seven Brazilian-born players on the field.

That's one more than the number of English players involved in the second leg, which Chelsea won 1-0 in extra time thanks to Branislav Ivanovic's goal to advance to Wembley 2-1 on aggregate.

Mourinho named Samba stars Filipe Luis, Willian and Oscar in his starting line-up, plus the Brazilian-born Diego Costa, further bolstering the South American presence by introducing Ramires shortly after the break.

Costa, who was granted Spanish citizenship in September 2013 and now represents the Spain national team, was certainly in the thick of the action.

The striker felt he deserved a penalty when fouled by Martin Skrtel, but he could face retrospective punishment for a stamp on Emre Can before later clashing with Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. 

Brendan Rodgers, meanwhile, named Lucas Leiva and Philippe Coutinho in his XI, further strengthening the Brazilian connection.

Having secured their place in the March 1 final, where they will face either Tottenham or Sheffield United, Chelsea's contingent will hope to join the rather eclectic mix of Brazilians who have lifted the League Cup in recent years.

Fernandinho was in the team for Manchester City when they defeated Sunderland last season, while Doni was the back-up goalkeeper for Liverpool when they edged out Cardiff City to win in 2012.

Rafael Da Silva was part of the Manchester United team that beat Aston Villa to defend their League Cup crown in 2010, while Anderson and Rodrigo Possebon were part of United's final squad that beat Spurs a year earlier.

The last Chelsea team to reach a League Cup final, losing to Tottenham in 2008, included Brazilians Juliano Belletti in the starting line-up and Alex on the bench.
