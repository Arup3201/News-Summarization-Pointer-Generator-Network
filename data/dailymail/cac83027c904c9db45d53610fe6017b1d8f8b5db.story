The National Basketball Association is one of the pre-eminent sport Leagues in the world and every week, Bleacher Report will bring you a round-up of all the action on and off court Stateside.

HEADLINE-MAKER

Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose was named the 2008-09 Rookie of the Year and 2010-11 NBA MVP. However he has been hampered by injuries and has missed most of two years with serious knee injuries. After missing four of the first seven games this season, he courted controversy. 

He said: 'I know a lot of people get mad when they see me sit out or whatever, but ... when I sit out, it's not because of this year. I'm thinking about long term. I'm thinking about, after I'm done with basketball, having graduations to go to, having meetings to go to. I don't want to be in my meetings all sore or be at my son's graduation all sore just because of something I did in the past, so it's just learning and being smart.' 

Following his comments the Chicago Sun Times front page simply read 'Priority' with the sub-text 'Rose has odd reason for choosing to sit out so many games on Bulls' time.' Perhaps not the greatest PR move from a guy on a £60million contract. Rose missed his second straight game on Monday, and his sixth of the season, due to a hamstring injury and is considered day-to-day until further notice.

GOOD WEEK

By scoring nine first-half points on November 14, Tim Duncan became the 19th player in league history to score at least 25,000 points in his career. All told, Duncan scored 13 points (6-of-8 shooting) and grabbed 11 rebounds as the San Antonio Spurs trounced the Los Angeles Lakers 93-80. Duncan joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in an illustrious points-rebounds-blocks club. The pair are the only ones to have scored 25,000 points, had 14,000 rebounds and 2,500 blocks in NBA history.

BAD WEEK

The Philadelphia 76ers have lost their opening 10 games of the season and suffered a 123-70 blowout loss to the Dallas Mavericks last weekend. The Sixers scored just 10 points in the first quarter and trailed 73-29 at the half. The 44-point difference at the half was the second-largest in NBA history. The 53-point loss was the third-worst in Sixers' history and was the largest margin of victory in Mavs' history. 

Michael Carter-Williams, who won the NBA Rookie of the Year award last season, returned from a shoulder injury to make his season debut but even his presence couldn't compel the team to win. What does Carter-Williams do to relax and tune out all of the criticism? 

'For me, it's all about Ellen. I just think she's awesome. So every weekday at 4pm, my stepfather and I pause the basketball talk, grab some snacks and watch The Ellen Degeneres Show. It might sound funny, but this is one of the ways I'm able to get away from the frustration of losing,' he said.

FESTIVE CHEER

The NBA have unveiled the uniforms that all 10 teams will wear for the 2014 Christmas Day games. The uniforms feature traditional tank-top style jerseys that showcase each team's primary logo on the front. Continuing with the tradition of introducing new and unique jersey elements, this year's uniforms will include each player's first name on the back of the jerseys as a nod to their familiarity and popularity with the NBA fan base around the world. The special edition Swingman jersey is available for £75.

AND FINALLY... 

If you've ever typed 'Nets.com' into your Internet browser, funky things would happen. Sometimes you'd be taken to the Boston Celtics homepage. Other times you'd find NBA commissioner Mark Cuban sticking his tongue in your face. The New York Times reported that the website, long hailed as a monument to 'trolling' the Brooklyn Nets, is owned by Jane Hill, a former photographer and telecom businesswoman living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 

Hill, 69, says she purchased 'Nets.com' in 1996 for £12,800. She says she's since enjoyed being the subject of Internet and NBA intrigue over the last several years. Hill says she began shopping the domain after the Nets announced their plans to move to Brooklyn. Having sold other domains for 'seven-figure sums,' she decided to ask for £3.2million in her pitch to the team who have refused to yield thus far.
