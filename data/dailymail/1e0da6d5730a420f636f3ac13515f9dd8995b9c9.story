Sharon Villette lost more than 12 pints of blood when son Liam (pictured) was born two months early

A  mother-of-two was left close to death after losing more than 12 pints of blood during a traumatic premature delivery.

Sharon Villette, 36, haemorrhaged during an emergency Caesarean section due to placenta accreta, a condition which affects just one in 2,500 pregnancies.

It occurs when the placenta attaches itself to scar tissue left from a previous operation.

Mrs Villette, of Colchester, required seven litres of blood and her family was warned that she and her baby son Liam might not survive the delivery.

But two years on, he has developed into a perfectly healthy toddler despite being born more than two months premature.

Mrs Villette said: 'I was in hospital for a checkup and had popped to the loo when I experienced major bleeding. The next thing I knew, I was being prepared for surgery.

'My husband was warned I might not wake up. It was a complete whirlwind.

'Five hours later I came round, having had the Caesarean. My son had been taken to a different hospital and I was utterly disorientated.'

After first experiencing heavy bleeding during the 18th week of her pregnancy, doctors at Colchester General Hospital told Mrs Villette she had placenta praevia - otherwise known as low-lying placenta - which occurs in around one in 200 pregnancies.

She said: 'They monitored the baby’s heartbeat and thankfully everything seemed fine. I was told to go home and be very careful.

'If I started bleeding again, I had to go back into hospital immediately.

'One morning, while I was 26 weeks pregnant, I started bleeding heavily as I was getting my daughter ready for school.

Baby Liam was rushed to the neotnatal unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Doctors had warned he might not survive his mother's labour

'I decided to go into hospital and it was very lucky I did. The bleeding got worse when I went to the toilet. I pulled the emergency cord and suddenly I was surrounded by medical staff.'

Her husband Andrew, 48, a bricklayer, was called in to be by her side and she was prepped for an emergency Caesarean section under general anesthetic.

Mrs Villette, a secondary school learning support worker, said: 'The doctors warned my family after I had been sedated that I was in a very serious situation. If they couldn’t control the bleeding, then both I and the baby would have been lost.'

During the delivery doctors battled to stabilise her, giving her more than 12 pints of blood over two hours.

When she woke, five hours after being sedated, she was weak - and discovered Liam, who had been born weighing just 2lb 2oz, had been rushed to Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge for specialised care.

Doctors later explained to Mrs Villette that her placenta had attached itself to scar tissue left over from the Cesarean section delivery of her daughter Jessica, now six - a far rarer condition called placenta accreta.

The condition, which occurs in around one in 2,500 pregnancies, can cause serious complications and, as in Mrs Villette’s case, often requires a hysterectomy.

he said: 'I know that for some people, having a hysterectomy for medical reasons can leave regret hanging over them, but not us. We don’t want any more children - we are content with the family we have.'

She added: 'I’d had a Caesarean with Jessica because she’d had a breech birth. Somehow, Liam’s placenta had become attached to the scar tissue.

'It explained the regular bleeding. Every time Liam had moved in my womb, the lining had been seriously damaged.'

In the end, she didn't see him until he was five days old, when she was strong enough to leave hospital and travel to the  neonatal unit at Addenbrooke’s.

She said: 'I felt very protective over him. Until then, I’d been disorientated and overwhelmed, but to see him in the ward with all the other premature children was a very emotional experience.'

Having turned two in February, Liam is hitting developmental milestones on schedule, despite his precarious start in life.

Mrs Villette said: 'Jessica loves to help with him. They’re extremely close. I’m aware that the experience affected the family more than it did me.

'From my perspective, I went to sleep and woke up following the delivery not feeling very well. But my family was told that they might lose me and the baby. I’m glad I didn’t have to go through that stress.

'We are now looking to the future. Liam is a little boy who needs all the love and care we can give him, and we are ready to move on in life.'
