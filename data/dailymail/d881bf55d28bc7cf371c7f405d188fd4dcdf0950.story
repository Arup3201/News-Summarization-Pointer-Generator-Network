School's out: Sasha Young is putting pen to paper about her parents' divorce

He’s the property tycoon and fixer for oligarchs who went bankrupt, claiming he had lost his £2 billion fortune. She is the wife who insists he has hidden it to avoid paying her a divorce settlement.

Now, while Scot Young, 49, and his estranged wife Michelle prepare for the next bitter battle at the High Court over their £400 million divorce, their younger daughter, Sasha, is putting pen to paper to record her feelings on the break-up that has destroyed her once luxurious family life.

Sasha, 17, no longer at school because her father hasn’t paid the fees — she left £14,400–a-year girls’ day school Francis Holland in the summer — is looking for a publisher for what she describes as a ‘self-help children’s novel’.

‘I wouldn’t want anyone to go through what my sister and I have been through,’ says Sasha, who has eight GCSEs and would ideally be studying for her  A-levels now. 

‘I am still hoping something good will happen out of the  next hearing and that I can go back to studying.

‘I know my situation is not the norm, but I still think I have something to say to help others.’

Former model Michelle, 47 — who in happier days was given £1 million worth of Graff jewellery for her 40th birthday by Scot — believes the court hearing on January 16 will be crucial.

She insists she has hard evidence — retrieved from two laptops given to her daughters by her husband — that Scot has salted away his fortune in overseas bank accounts.

She tells me: ‘I am proud of  my daughters. Scarlet has had to leave school, too, and she is working as a model. Sasha’s book is brilliant.’

Sasha adds: ‘I have learned a lot. I think I can help others. I am aiming the book at eight to 13-year-olds.

‘I don’t want to write a boring book of bullet points on how to deal with your parents’ marriage break-up and divorce. I don’t think anyone would read that.

‘So I am writing it in the form of a children’s novel with two main characters, who will be the children in a story based on all my real-life experiences.’
