Two of Britain’s main broadband providers are to confront people trying to view web pages showing child sexual abuse with prominent warnings.

Following a campaign by the Daily Mail, TalkTalk will tomorrow follow the example of BT in trying to deter customers from accessing paedophile sites by telling them the images have been identified as indecent by the Internet Watch Foundation.

TalkTalk last week began the process of forcing all 4million of its broadband customers to choose whether to impose parental controls.

So far, roughly one in three households has done so, corresponding roughly to the number with underage children.

In a significant concession, the company also expects to announce a fund of about £1million to boost the tracking of child abuse images.

The move will pile pressure on Google to take similar steps to limit its users’ access to child pornography sites.

Last week Prime Minister David Cameron, speaking after it was revealed that Mark Bridger, the killer of five-year-old April Jones, had viewed child porn, said he was ‘sickened’ by the proliferation of illegal images and demanded action.

At present someone trying to view a web page blocked by the IWF receives an error message, as if the page does not exist.

The IWF has a list of 1,300 blocked web pages and websites.

Under the new scheme, which BT began operating last Friday, people will be confronted with the message: ‘access has been denied... because this page may contain indecent images of children as identified by the IWF’.

Other measures to be announced include a service to place parental controls on every wi-fi-enabled device in a home.
