Javier Hernandez could be in line for his first start for Real Madrid on Tuesday night against Elche having made an instant impact in the Spanish capital after his move from Manchester United.

It did not go unnoticed in Spain at the weekend that as Real managed to score eight goals against Deportivo La Coruna, Karim Benzema failed to register. ‘Chicharito’ climbed off the bench to score two of the goal of the season contenders late in the second half and now Carlo Ancelotti is under pressure to pick the Mexican.

Ancelotti defended Benzema after the game, saying that he looked at more than the names of the goalscorers.

‘He played well in Riazor even though he didn't score; I look at things beyond that,’ he said. But he is expected to leave Benzema out of his staring line-up as Real look to get their second win in the space of four days.

It may still be that young attacking midfielder Isco is the man who benefits from Benzema being rested and that Hernandez has to content himself with another place on the bench but whatever happens his two goals have immediately earned him a place in the affections of Real Madrid supporters – especially those who jeered and whistled the France striker at every turn in the club’s last home game in the Champions League against Basle.

In truth, Hernandez’s spectacular showing against Deportivo owed much to the way the game had gone with weak opposition long since having thrown in the towel when he made his entrance.

He will find far more space late in games in La Liga – especially against team who have already accepted heavy defeat against Real before he makes his entrance. 

Strikers never like to be taken off at the end of games because they know there are rich pickings as the clock ticks down and the gaps in tired defences begin to appear. After years of struggling to find space in the Premier League that will come as a welcomed change.

And ‘welcome change’ is the way many Madrid supporters see the ‘Little Pea’s’ arrival at the Bernabeu. The theory put forward last summer by Benzema’s defenders in the Spanish capital was that he would respond badly to competition and so a replacement for Gonzalo Higuain was never bought.

But his credit has run dry since then and the competition is now up and running. Hernandez has gone from contesting a place in the starting line-up with Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie at United to trying to oust Benzema at the Bernabeu.

Saturday's spectacular double has given him the perfect launch pad for a far more prosperous career in Spain than he enjoyed at Old Trafford.
