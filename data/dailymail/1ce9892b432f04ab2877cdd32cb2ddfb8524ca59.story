A remarkable collection of film frames created by a 10-year-old boy about the First World War have been revealed for the first time.

The frames - which created by drawing scenes on to long strips of paper and shown to an audience by pulling them through slits in a cardboard box - were made by a young Charles Harold Wood, who went on to become a renowned film maker.

Several of the frames make up a feature entitled Civilisation, Parts 1, 2 and 3. They depict an unnamed emperor who prepares for war for 20 years before attacking his neighbouring country.

A 10-year-old CH Wood made a series of frames on paper detailing the events of the First World War. David Wood, son of the renowned film maker, discovered the collection when clearing out his father's home

Several of the films make up a feature entitled Civilisation, Parts 1, 2, and 3 - which follows an unnamed emperor preparing for war before attacking a neighbouring country

The frames - made on paper and shown to an audience by pulling them through slits in a cardboard box - are kept in small containers, pictured

Although neither Germany or England are mentioned in the films, it loosely follows the Great War through many of its famous battles.

On one of the reels 'Another great empire comes to help the invaded country' is written.

Elsewhere, a drawing of Trafalgar Square shows people crowding round Nelson's Column with the line 'Your King and Country Need You!' inscribed.

Also included in the collection are a series of maps, handmade newspapers and director information.

In one, the child has written the film would cost 'over Â£20,000 to produce, with a cast of 50,000 people, battleships, aeroplanes, motor cars, submarines and airships'.

The 'films' were made by the boy between the ages of 10 and 14, Mr Wood pictured, said

It goes on to explain '80 pieces of heavy field artillery and 3,000 rifles were used, 400 tents were erected and 1,000,000 rounds of ammunition were fired.'

The young Mr Wood adds 'Real cities were built to be destroyed' and '12 ambulances were used'.

The film was made by Charles Harold 
Wood, more commonly known as CH Wood, an internationally renowned 
photograher and film maker from Bradford, West Yorkshire.

His
 film maker son David, 70, discovered the movie along with six others as
 he cleared out a storeroom at his home in Esholt.

He said: 'This is the only thing I've seen that show the First World War through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy.

'He would have spent hours creating these films and would have shown them to family and friends.

'I first discovered them 40-years ago when I was clearing out my dad's house and briefly looked at them, then I dug them out again 30-years ago to show my son and daughter.

'Now that I have more time I got them out again and just realised how fascinating and interesting they were.

CH Wood, aged 12 when he would have been creating the films and newspapers

'These were definitely his first ever foray into film, although these are single frame, not films.'

He added his father, who 
flew in the RAF in the Second World War, would have made the films between the ages of 
ten and 14 alongside his self-published newspaper - of which there are 
about 200 issues.

The homemade newspapers, which he called 'The World's News' documented events both home and abroad.

David said: 'He was an avid newspaper reader. He took notice of the way the pages were laid out as well as the content and he tried to reproduce it.'

The papers even contained cinema listings, competitions and jokes.

'You could look at them for hours, it is so interesting to see how he saw the world, and to see the snippets of news about Bradford in the war years,' Mr Wood added.

In a 1914 edition the young Charles mentions a Zeppelin alarm in Bradford and how it effected the city.

Writing the next day he somberly reports on the number of people killed in an airship bombardment in East Yorkshire.

The young Charles even brought out special supplements, including one on the navy, one on aeroplanes and one on the Russians.

Mr Wood said: 'The writing becomes more sophisticated as Charles gets older. I think he started out just before the war, in 1913, using a John Bull printing set, but went on to use a proper typewriter.'

He hopes now that his dad's collection will now be displayed in some form for the public to enjoy.

He added: 'I would love to think it would go into some type of WWI centenary exhibition locally and if not maybe the War Museum would be interested later on.

'I'm very proud of my dad. I'm building up a scrapbook of things he did, for my grandchildren and great grandchildren.

'He had three great loves in life my dad, photography, motorbikes and flying.

'His main speciality in photography was aerial photography.'

CH Wood died in 1980 aged 79, he had three children, David, Malcolm and Heather.

Both Malcolm and David worked in their father's photography and film making busineess, CH Wood Bradford Ltd.

Mr Wood said his father was awarded an MBE for developing a day/night flying system for pilots and trained the Dambusted for night flying.
