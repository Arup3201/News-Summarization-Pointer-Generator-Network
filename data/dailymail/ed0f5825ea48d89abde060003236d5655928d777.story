It's breakfast time in Joyce’s Cafe and Arden Thompson and his buddies are chatting over eggs-over-easy and mugs of coffee.

Dressed in patched jackets and well-worn cowboy boots, and their faces flushed from the snow-storm outside, they could be mistaken for poor farmers who once eked out a living in this remote corner of North Dakota.

Until you hear their topics of conversations. It is not about the crops of wheat or barley they once tended but racehorses, second homes in the sun, the latest cruises they have been on and, most importantly, the size of their most recent cheques.

Arden and his friends are all newly minted millionaires, a modern breed of oil baron made rich almost overnight by a ‘fracking boom’ that has turned North Dakota into America’s second-biggest oil producer.

The US is enjoying a new  black gold rush thanks to the method of extracting oil and natural gas from shale rock using a chemical and water mix.

Last week, a US government report announced that geologists believe the Monterey Shale, a geological formation covering 1,750 square miles south of San Francisco, could hold more than 15 billion barrels of oil.

Fracking booms in Texas, Wyoming, Montana and Ohio mean US oil production exceeds seven million barrels a day for the first time in 20 years.

America is on track to be energy independent in five years and become ‘Saudi America’ – potentially overtaking Saudi Arabia as the world’s biggest oil producer within a decade.

North Dakota, which lies above the Bakken formation – 200,000 square miles containing vast oil deposits only recently accessible thanks to fracking – has been dubbed ‘Kuwait on the prairie’ by locals still pinching themselves at their good fortune.

Twelve new millionaires are being created each week thanks to companies leasing mineral rights beneath land often held by farming families for generations.

The towns of Williston (pop 14,716) and Stanley (pop 4,000),  75 miles away, are at the epicentre of the Bakken boom.

Plunging temperatures and heavy snow failed to dampen the sense of excitement in the air in Stanley last week. I watched as truck after truck thundered by on Highway 2. In one direction they head to the oil fields loaded with water, chemicals, sand and supplies. In the other, giant tankers return filled with crude.

Fracking started here five years ago but it has only been in the past 18 months that locals say it has ‘gone mad’.

Arden, 68, takes me for a drive  in his new truck. He recently purchased a horse farm in Phoenix (‘where me and the wife plan to spend the winter’), went on an Alaskan cruise, has invested in an apartment block and, two weeks ago, bought his first racehorse. ‘Nodding donkey’ oil rigs stretch as far as the eye can see over flat prairies covered in snow. 

Locals are not worried about environmental concerns which have dominated the fracking debate in the UK. Oil deposits here are 20,000-30,000ft down.

The water supply is at 1,000ft. Arden says: ‘We love this land more than anyone. The oil companies work with us, they clean the fracking water before they take it away and there are safety inspectors crawling all over the rigs.

‘We have zero unemployment, the economy is booming and we are playing a massive part in making America energy independent. You won’t hear any moaning around here – well, maybe from those folk who don’t own mineral rights.’

Arden refuses to say how much he has earned but admits to being  a multi-millionaire. A typical well can earn $50,000 to $100,000 a month in royalties – about £33,000 to £66,000. State tax records for 2012 show 650 households in Stanley declared ‘new income’ over a million dollars.

All Arden’s friends are millionaires several times over – one rancher receiving an eye-popping $1 million cheque last month. ‘He owns a massive amount of land,’ says Arden. ‘But that was a record even around here. The problem now is investing the money. It’s like winning the lottery every month.

‘And as they drill more wells, my cheques get bigger. I’m buying property and setting up trusts for my kids and grandkids.’ There are currently 9,000 oil-producing wells across North Dakota, with 2,300 more coming on stream this year.

Experts say the Bakken rigs should produce oil for the next 50 years, and Stanley’s population is expected to double over the next 18 months.

The Fire Spot bar is buzzing at 3pm on Friday. Tim Staude, 45, tells me he works five 14-hour days followed by five days off, and  earned $100,000 last year.

‘The company gives me free accommodation. It’s tough work and there are no women but the money’s good. There’s nothing else to do except drink. But I’m not complaining. I’m working hard, making money and helping my country. It’s the American dream.’
