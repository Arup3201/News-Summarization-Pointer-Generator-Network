It's all to play for in the Copa Sudamericana final after Atletico Nacional and River Plate drew the first leg 1-1 in Colombia on Wednesday night.

Nacional dominated the first-half and took a 34th-minute lead when Orlando Berrio fired past River goalkeeper Marcelo Barovero from a tight angle after being played in by Edwin Cardona.

But Leonardo Pisculichi equalised with a half-volley midway through the second half to hand the Argentine side a draw heading back to Buenos Aires for next week's deciding leg.

River had defeated their bitter rivals Boca Juniors in the semi-finals last month, while Nacional overcame Brazilian side Sao Paulo to book their place in the final.

Their supporters lit up the Estadio Atanasio Girardot ahead of kick-off by setting off dozens of green smoke flares and it certainly seemed to inspire the team in the first-half.

They pressed River back but didn't gain their reward until Berrio's smart finish 11 minutes before the break. His goal was his first for Nacional since August and certainly well-timed.
