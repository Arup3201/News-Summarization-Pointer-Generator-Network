Sri Lankan 'true great' Muttiah Muralitharan will act as a team coaching consultant for Australia during their autumn tour of the United Arab Emirates against Pakistan.

The highest Test match wicket-taker of all time - he registered his 800th in July 2010, shortly before retiring - will work with Australian players as they prepare for October's Test series against Pakistan in the UAE.

Australia head coach Darren Lehmann said: 'Muttiah Muralitharan is a true great of the game and his involvement with the Australian team will bring enormous benefits.

'He really understands the conditions we'll face and will be able to impart a great amount of knowledge.

'Not only will he help guide our spinners during that tour, but he will also work with our batsmen to help them prepare to play Pakistan's dangerous spin bowlers.

'As we've shown in recent times we'll bring in dedicated skill-specific coaching consultants to our support staff as and when we see fit.

'That means having more regular support from technical experts to help work on specific areas of performance.

True great: The Sri Lankan is the leading wicket-taker in Test history

'Most recently we had Shane Warne join us in South Africa, and throughout the Australian summer we had a range of former Australian players around the team during the Test series to help impart specialist knowledge.

'This time around we are fortunate enough to have Muttiah work with us.'

Australian spin bowler Nathan Lyon is currently in Sri Lanka working with Muralitharan and spin coach John Davison along with emerging players James Muirhead, Will Bosisto, Clive Rose and Matthew Short.
