Winston Bogarde is the latest name to be linked with the vacant manager’s position at Motherwell.

The former Chelsea and Barcelona defender, who was part of the Ajax squad that won the Champions League in 1995, is among a large number of applications received by the club since Stuart McCall’s shock resignation.

Bogarde is not the first Dutch legend to be linked with a vacant managerial positions in Scottish football. 

Winston Bogarde, 44, has applied for the vacant manager's position at Scottish side Motherwell

At Chelsea: 2001-04 

Wage: £40,000 per week

Appearances: nine 

Bogarde was signed by Gianluca Vialli, but within weeks of the Dutch defender arriving in London Vialli was sacked. New boss Claudio Ranieri wasn't keen on the former Barcelona man and limited his appearances. Bogarde retired in 2005 after leaving Chelsea.

Patrick Kluivert was mentioned as a potential Ross County manager earlier this season after the departure of Derek Adams. 

That post was ultimately filled by Jim McIntyre.

Adams remains among the frontrunners for the vacant Fir Park post although former St Johnstone boss Steve Lomas has made his interest known, while former manager Terry Butcher could prove popular among fans.

Caretaker boss Kenny Black will take charge of Motherwell when they take on table toppers Dundee United.

The Dutch defender spent two years at Spanish giants Barcelona and four years in London with Chelsea
