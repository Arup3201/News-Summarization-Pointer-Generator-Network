A desperate husband has put an ad on the back of his truck appealing for a kidney donor for his sick wife.

Michelle Stewart, of Henderson, Colorado, learned about her failing kidneys last February before going on a waiting list, the Denver Post reported.

Working with her husband Bob Stewart, Michelle tried various attempts to spread the word that she needed a new kidney and Bob put the want ad up on his truck last month.

The couple are heartened after many people have put themselves foward. 

Tests are being done on some to see if they could be a match for Michelle, the Stewarts told the Denver Post. 

He told the Denver Post:  'I thought, maybe a couple people will come forward. And then a guy took a picture of it and posted it on Reddit, and it went viral.'

KFOR reported an image of the truck appeared on Imgur, where it has been viewed over 3 million times and received almost 900 comments, before it popped up on Reddit, where it has received over 3,600 comments.

In a flyer Michelle posted to Imgur, she wrote 'I have struggled with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus since the age of 13. 

'Since then, I have survived two comas, a stroke, seizure, chemotherapy, and temporary paralysis.'

'Multiple times my parents were told that my life would be ending and thus far I have beaten the odds. One of the comas left me with severe kidney damage.' 

Michelle wrote in the flyer she is not yet on dialysis, and told the Denver Post that she is eating a dialysis diet.

She told the newspaper 'That part of it has been crazy, but it saved my life. Most people don't have the luxury I have of waiting ... I've been able to live on my kidneys for a year while I look for a donor.'

University of Colorado Hospital's Dr. James Cooper told the newspaper 'many, many interested people' have called the hospital. 

Michelle told the Denver Post 'I'm looking for the grace of a stranger. I talked to my doctor today, and he said I'm getting close. 

'I can feel my body slowing down. I know that I'm changing. He said that it's a good thing this happened, because I'm very close to needing the transplant.'
