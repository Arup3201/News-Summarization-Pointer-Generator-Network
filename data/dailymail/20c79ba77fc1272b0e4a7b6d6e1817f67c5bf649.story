Health food giant Holland & Barrett has been attacked by race equality charities for selling a £9.99 cream which claims to make skin whiter.

The Royal Jelly Skin Body Whitening Cream  is stocked in a number of the retailer's 620 British stores and is listed on its website.

The label insists it is for sun damage, spots and freckles - but its sale was criticised by campaigners, who claimed it was a throwback to ideas about lighter skin signifying higher social class.

Jabeer Bhutt, the deputy chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, has asked Holland & Barrett to remove the cream from its shelves to set an example.

'In 1930s America, if your skin was lighter than a brown bag you could go through the front door and if it wasn't you had to go round the back,' he said. 'We have moved on since then.

'It's a shock to us that anybody, particularly Holland & Barrett, would make anything like this available.

'Although I can't speak for this particular product, many of these creams have very questionable properties.

'But our worry here is a more wide-ranging one about what it means to be beautiful and what it means not to be beautiful.

'Consumers should be able to decide for themselves, but my worry is that this is part of a much bigger issue that's been impacting particularly on children and young people.

'In Bollywood films for example there is a very active debate about actresses having to lighten their skin to appear on screen.'

Description: The packaging insisted the cream can be used for age, liver and sun spots as well as blemishes and scars - but campaigners claimed such creams are designed with ethnic minority customers in mind

Debbie Weekes-Bernard, of the Runnymede Trust equality think-tank, told The Independent the firm 'clearly knows its target demographic and why they'll buy it'.

She added it was an 'insult to generations of work done to encourage darker-skinned people to have pride in their skin'.

The cream on sale is made by Dr Organic, a Swansea-based firm which sells an array of natural products including coconut oil and snail gel. 

It does not include controversial bleaching chemicals or steroids which have caused other whitening creams to make headlines.

Instead it uses an extract from the common brown algae ascophyllum nodosum, which it says reduces production of the skin pigment melanin.

The product's packaging insists it can be used on age, liver and sun spots, freckles, scars, blemishes, discoloured skin patches and darkened elbows and knees alongside 'general skin brightening' - a sentiment which was echoed by a Holland & Barrett spokesman to the Independent.  

Commonplace: Skin whitening creams with names such as 'white babyface' shown on sale in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2006. Millions of people use them around the world but their existence is controversial to some

The campaigners, however, claim that despite not being harmful to skin it projects the wrong messages about beauty.

One customer using the Dr Organic cream wrote online: 'I've used this product for three months, once or twice a day, and my entire family has seen effective results.

'I've gone a couple shades lighter... It's organic so you know its actually doing something, unlike other products which just bleach you.

'This is my second bottle, I got my entire family using it because it doesn't just make you lighter, it gives you this nice glow.'

A spokesman for Holland and Barrett said: 'Dr. Organic Skin Whitening Cream was developed due to a demand for a product which helps to lighten age spots, freckles and hyperpigmented skin on the face and body. 

'The core ingredient is a natural extract called Ascophyllum nodosum which is a brown algae. It has proven skin whitening attributes especially for use on age spots, liver spots, freckles, sun damaged skin, scars blemishes, dark elbows and knees as well as general skin brightening. 

'The rest of the formula helps to condition, protect and moisturise the skin. We do not use harsh bleaching agents.'

The row surrounding skin-whitening techniques dates back several decades. 

Campaigners say their very existence is a nod to underlying racism in society, implying that lighter skin makes people more beautiful.

Some unregulated creams have also contained bleaching chemicals such as hydroquinone, which some studies say have caused severe skin damage and unsightly blotches.

Three traders in Brixton, south London, were fined £51,000 in 2007 for selling illegal skin lightening creams which contained harmful steroids. 

Despite the controversies, whitening creams are still used by millions of people from Britain to South Africa, Nigeria, India and Thailand.
