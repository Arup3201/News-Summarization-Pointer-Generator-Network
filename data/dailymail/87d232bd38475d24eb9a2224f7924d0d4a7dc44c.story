Aston Villa may have to wait until the summer to sign Tom Cleverley on a permanent basis.

As part of his loan agreement from Manchester United, Villa can buy Cleverley for £7.5million this window but he is thought to want to keep his options open for when he becomes a free agent.

Everton tried to hijack Villa’s move last summer and Roberto Martinez is believed to retain an interest. Other clubs are likely to look at bringing in a player with 13 England caps for nothing.

The 25-year-old has made 18 appearances for Villa so far this season but has failed to find the net for them

Paul Lambert has expressed a desire to activate the clause in Cleverley’s deal this month to get the midfielder fully on board but the sum of money may also prove a stumbling block.

Cleverley is on a season-long loan in any case so Villa have his services whatever until the end of May as they try to arrest a run of two wins in 17 Premier League games.

The 25-year-old has made 18 appearances for Villa so far this season but has failed to find the net on any of those occasions.
