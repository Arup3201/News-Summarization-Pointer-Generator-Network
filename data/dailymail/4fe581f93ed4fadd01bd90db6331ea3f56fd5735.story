The world’s third largest cruise ship is one step closer to making her maiden voyage from England to America.

With 18 decks and room for 4,180 guests, Quantum of the Seas has sailed into a German port for its final touches less than a month before it carries holidaymakers for the first time.

It is the most high-tech cruise ship in the world, boasting robot bartenders, electronic wristbands that serve as room keys, and virtual balconies for internal rooms without windows.

But its crown jewel is the unique North Star, a glass observation capsule suspended from a giant arm which will lift passengers 300ft above sea level.

The passenger pod, similar to the capsules on the London Eye, offers 360-degree panoramic views of the ocean.

When passengers aren’t being lifted over the water, they can partake in a number of firsts at sea, including a skydiving simulator and bumper cars, dine at one of 18, restaurants, including an Italian franchise from Jamie Oliver, or retire to the largest guest rooms of any Royal Caribbean International vessel.

In addition to a skydiving simulator, there is a surf simulator, rock climbing wall and venues for live performances, including the musical Mamma Mia! and tribute bands.

The massive ship is currently docked in Bremerhaven, Germany, where Eric Serakas snapped an aerial photo using a GoPro camera attached to a drone.

The 26-year-old from Florida, who has dual German and American citizenship, said he had spent time on Allure of the Seas, the world's largest cruise ship, last year and was excited to try the new one.

He said: ‘When I first saw the ship I thought to myself, 'Oh my, Royal Caribbean has done it again'. When I took the photo the North Star was being added to the ship by crane.

He added: "It is one of the last major pieces to be added to the ship before it is ready to go to sea trials.

‘It's Royal Caribbean's newest ship in their fleet and the North Star is the signature attraction of this newest ship and first ever smart ship.’

Billed as ‘the world’s most futuristic and advanced ship’, Quantum of the Seas is the first in Royal Caribbean’s new Quantum class of vessels.

Quantum of the Seas is wired with ground-breaking ‘smart’ technology aimed at taking the stress out of holidays.

It has the fastest internet speeds at sea using a new generation of mid-Earth orb satellites, and smartphone apps that allow guests to plan their shore excursions, book restaurant reservations or set up spa appointments.

The robot bartenders are the first of their kind anywhere in the world, while robotics are also at work in an entertainment venue where six ‘roboscreens’ move or unite as one during performances.
