The shocking figures add to growing fears of a casualty crisis in hospitals, which the College of Emergency Medicine say could be the worst ever (picture posed by model)

At least 12,000 patients spent 12 or more hours on trolleys in casualty units last year.

Another 250 waited for a minimum of 24 hours and one was left for an astonishing 71 hours and 34 minutes – all but three days.

That case – at North West London trust, which runs Northwick Park and Central Middlesex A&E units – emerged in a Mail investigation using freedom of information laws.

Hospitals were asked how many patients were in casualty for more than 12 hours, for more than 24 hours and what their longest wait time was in 2012/13.

One waited for 37 hours at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen A&E while another waited for 33 hours at Ashford and St Peter’s in Chertsey, Surrey.

Campaigners said the figures showed the situation in accident and emergency departments was getting ‘worse and worse’.

‘Patients who are forced to spend that length of time on trolleys will be in a far worse state than when they arrived,’ said Roger Goss of Patient Concern.

‘People feel they have nowhere else to go. They can’t get an appointment with their GP and their out-of-hours service – NHS 111 – tells them to go to A&E.’

Casualty units are dealing with growing numbers of patients and a desperate shortage of doctors.

Dr Cliff Mann, president of the College of Emergency Medicine, said this winter would ‘probably be worse than last winter, which was the worst we have ever had’. 

He added: ‘It’s not chaos in emergency departments, but it is a crisis.’

The Prime Minister has intervened to help draw up contingency plans that would see beds freed up in private hospitals should A&E units become too full.

David Cameron has also demanded weekly updates on the situation.

And tomorrow, the NHS’s top doctor, Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, will set out a major report setting out what needs to be done to avert a major crisis in A&E.

Doris Miller, pictured with son Michael, was left lying on a hospital trolley in the accident and emergency department at East Surrey Hospital for 28 hours

Doris Miller was abandoned on a hospital trolley for 28 hours.

The 95-year-old had been taken to A&E in an ambulance  after falling in the shower and hurting her leg.

She was wheeled into a sideroom at East Surrey hospital in Redhilll and left frightened and exhausted – and given nothing but a sandwich.

It later transpired that staff had forgotten about her and recorded that she had been discharged to a care home.

She was found the following afternoon after her son Michael, 68, phoned the chief executive and threatened to report her to the police as missing.

He said: ‘I was furious. This is what happens when you put too much pressure on a system that doesn’t work. 

‘I asked which home she was in, but they wouldn’t tell me because of  data protection. I rang the ward, but they said they had never heard of her.

‘The next morning, I was told she was on another ward, so I checked with that ward, and again they said that they had never heard of her. 

‘When I finally saw her, she looked dehydrated, confused and distressed. She had received no proper care.’ 

The hospital insisted Mrs Miller was properly cared for in 2011 but launched an inquiry into the communication breakdown.

Peter Carter, of the Royal College of Nursing, said many of those forced to wait on trolleys would be ‘in distress’ and have nowhere else to go.

‘The types of people on the trolleys for days are the elderly,’ he added. ‘These are the people who go to the back of the queue. While they are in distress and discomfort, they are not critically ill.

‘It’s really distressing to think of patients in their twilight years being treated this way.’

Dr Carter said many of the longest waits were not recorded by staff and would not show up in the figures.

One patient waited for 37 hours at Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen A&E, above, the statistics showed

If patients are left in corridors or 
X-ray rooms just outside A&E, staff can tick a box to state they 
have left the department.

The number of patients arriving in A&E has soared by a third over the past decade and 22million were logged last year. Rising numbers of old people and the decline in out-of-hours care by GPs have been blamed.

Yesterday Monitor, a hospital watchdog, warned the closure of 50 walk-in centres had piled further pressure on casualty units.

Staff shortages are also a factor because doctors are increasingly reluctant to work the long and antisocial hours. Half of senior casualty posts have been left unfilled over the past three years.

Andy Burnham, Labour’s health spokesman, said: ‘David Cameron has presided over the worst year in A&E for a decade, but until now the true human cost has been hidden.

‘These devastating findings reveal the suffering behind the statistics.’

The Great Western Hospital in Swindon 
admitted that 12 patients a day have to wait on trolleys in corridors in
A&E and at North Cumbria hospital it happened ten times a day.

North Cumbria admitted patients were ‘occasionally’ left on trolleys in the relatives room.

Criticism: Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, above, said David Cameron has presided over 'the worst year for A&E in a decade'

At South Warwickshire hospital 
patients have been put in operating theatres when A&E is full and at
Walsall they have been put in X-ray rooms.

A
spokesman for North West London hospitals said the 71-hour case was due
to ‘exceptional circumstances’ and insisted the patient was ‘cared for 
safely by staff who are skilled in dealing with emergencies’. 

A
Department of Health spokesman said: ‘People should not be stuck in 
A&E for hours on end and these hospitals will need to explain what 
has happened in these cases.’

One in 20 nursing posts is vacant – 20,000 full-time hospital jobs. Figures obtained by the Royal College of Nursing also show 6 per cent of nursing or midwifery posts are unfilled at hospitals.

The college says too few nurses are replacing those who have retired because ministers have cut the number of training posts. Cash-strapped trusts have also been using recruitment freezes.

‘Understaffing remains a real issue across the NHS, and we know that many trusts are down to the bone in terms of the number of frontline nursing staff they have due to cutting posts to save money,’ said Peter Carter, chief executive and general secretary of the college.
