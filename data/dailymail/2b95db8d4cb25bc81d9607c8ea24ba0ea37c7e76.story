University students are spending six hours a day or more on social networking sites, looking at YouTube or sending text messages to friends, according  to new research.

The findings come as academics complain they are having to expel students from their lectures for not paying attention.

The survey, by accommodation providers Unite Student, found that 75 per cent of undergraduates spend between half an hour and two hours a day on Facebook or Twitter, with one in ten poring over the sites for at least three hours.

A similar proportion look at ‘video upload’ sites such as YouTube for between half an hour and two hours. Seven per cent watch them for three hours or more.

Nearly ten per cent then spend more than three hours using free text messaging services.

Dr Mark Griffiths, a psychologist and expert on social media at Nottingham Trent University, said more and more students used the sites during his lectures.

‘If I see anybody on their mobile, I stop the lecture until they put their phone away,’ he said. ‘If it happens a second time, they are out of my lecture.’

Professor Alan Smithers, the director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, warned: ‘You could end up missing the point of university – which is to immerse yourself in an academic subject and swap ideas with others – to the point that you could get a worse degree than you should.’
