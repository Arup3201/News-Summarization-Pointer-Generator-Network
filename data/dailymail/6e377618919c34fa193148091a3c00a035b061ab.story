Charges: Stephen Kaufman, 54, faces criminal charges after he attempted to perform a procedure on a patient while he was drunk

A Tennessee dentist faces criminal charges after he attempted to perform a procedure on a patient while he was drunk and refused to stop the procedure even when authorities approached him, officials say.

Stephen Kaufman, 54, of Hendersonville, was arrested and charged with reckless endangerment, driving under the influence, and violation of implied consent Thursday after allegedly operating on a 19-year-old patient while he was drunk.

Authorities say that Kaufman smelled of alcohol and had red, watery eyes while attempting to perform the procedure in a T-shirt, running shorts, and flip flops, according to the Tennessean.

Shelly Maichuk told WSMV that she was waiting for the 19-year-old, her nephew, outside of Cheatham Family Dentistry in Ashland where he was getting his wisdom teeth pulled when employees left the building proclaiming that Kaufman was drunk.

'Patients started coming out of the building,' Maichuk said. 'They started telling me that he was intoxicated. They could smell the liquor on his breath.'

Maichuk reportedly got her nephew out of the dentist's chair immediately, but he had already been sedated for the procedure. 

Authorities say that Kaufman had only been in his office for about an hour before the police were called.

Twice: Kaufman was reprimanded by the Tennessee Department of Health twice in the past, once in 2003 and again in 2007.

'He [Kaufman] was so disoriented,' Maichuk said. 'He didn't even recognize the police were coming. He didn't even realize that the patient was already up out of the chair.'

Ashland City Chief Deputy Kenny Ray told WSMV that it was obvious that Kaufman was intoxicated.

When authorities arrived, Kaufman told them he had not been drinking but later admitted to having been drinking four or five hours earlier, the Tennessean reports.

Kaufman reportedly failed three field sobriety tests and was unsteady on his feet in the office. 

A witness reported seeing Kaufman driving to his office before the incident, therefore Kaufman was given a DUI. 

Kaufman disputes these accusations and told the Tennessean that he believes an angry employee called the police making the false accusations. 

'I was not incapacitated in my office,' Kaufman said calling the allegations inflammatory and inaccurate.

Kaufman also questioned the DUI claiming officers never saw him driving his vehicle.

Valid: Kaufman is still allowed to continue practicing with his license from the Tennessee Board of Dentistry still valid despite being reprimanded twice before 

WSMV reports that Kaufman -- who is still allowed to continue practicing and his license from the Tennessee Board of Dentistry is still valid -- was disciplined twice in the past, according to Shelley Walker, a spokeswoman for the Tennessee Department of Health.

Department of Health records state that in 2003 Kaufman was reprimanded for removing a tooth from an 11-year-old child at a Halloween party without consent from the child's parents.

Kaufman was forced to attend a course on professional boundaries.  

Kaufman was forced to pay a $500 civility penalty and complete a class pertaining to record keeping after he failed to document that he had proper permission to perform a procedure on a patient in 2007.
