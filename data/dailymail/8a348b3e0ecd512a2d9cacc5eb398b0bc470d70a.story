Tragedy: The death of Horatio Chapple could have been prevented, ruled Norwegian prosecutors

The parents of an Eton schoolboy mauled to death by a polar bear on an adventure holiday have launched a legal bid for the tour leaders to face criminal charges.

Horatio Chapple, 17, was sleeping in a tent on a remote glacier near the Arctic Circle in August when the bear entered the tent, killing him and badly injuring four others.

Norwegian authorities ruled his death was preventable but that leaders of the trip would not be prosecuted.

His father David, a surgeon from Salisbury, Wiltshire, has now instructed lawyers in Oslo to try to get the prosecutorsâ€™ office in northern Norway to overturn the decision.

Lars Erik Alfheim, deputy governor of Norway's Svalbard Archipelago, said: 'There are different measures that could have been taken that might have prevented the attack.

'But based on our investigation, it appears that they've done what was required of them. None of the measures were legally required under local laws governing tour operators.'

Chapple's spinal surgeon father David, from Salisbury, is now appealing the decision not to prosecute to officials in Norway's far Northern Troms and Finnmark county.

His son Horatio was part of the expedition organised by BSES to the island of Spitsbergen last August. The team had set up camp on the Von Postbreen glacier and were sleeping in five tents when the 39-stone bear struck.

Horatio was killed and four others were injured by the rampaging animal before team leader Michael Reid, 27, managed to shoot the animal in the head with a rifle.

Students Patrick Flinders, 16, and Scott Smith, 17, who were sharing a tent with Horatio, were seriously injured in the attack.

Reid and fellow leader Andy Ruck, 27, had faced charges of negligence after reports that the rifle fired only after several attempts and tripwires that triggered flares failed to go off.

But Alfheim said the death was a result of 'a number of unfortunate circumstances'.

He
 said: 'Tripwire flares had been set up around the tent camp, and the 
group had two signal pens and a rifle. The equipment had been tested 
earlier, but the tripwire did not detonate when the bear entered the 
camp.

'A leader tried to 
fire a shot with the rifle, but did not succeed. When he managed to fire
 the rifle, the bear had already killed the 17-year-old, and wounded 
four others, amongst them himself.

'Technical studies have revealed that there were no malfunctions to the rifle, the cartridges or the tripwire flares.

'Instead, the accident was the result 
of a number of unfortunate circumstances that lead us to conclude that 
neither BSES nor any of the individuals involved should be charged with 
criminal negligence.'

An 
earlier post-mortem examination on the dead bear found that several of 
its teeth were 'very damaged', which would have caused the animal pain 
and may have made it more aggressive.

Edward
 Watson, chairman of BSES, would not comment on the Governor's ruling 
until the conclusion of its own inquiry into the incident, which is 
being headed by Sir David Steel.

But
 he added: 'Those most closely affected, particularly the Chapple 
family, remain uppermost in our thoughts at this especially difficult 
time for them.'

But they have been told they took 'additional risks' during the trip
