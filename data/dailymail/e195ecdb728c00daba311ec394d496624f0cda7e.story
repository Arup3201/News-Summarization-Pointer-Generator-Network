A couple who had been married for 67 years died just five hours apart at their farm in Easton, California, earlier this month.

Floyd and Violet Hartwig had both suffered ill health in recent years, but with their beds pushed together the couple held hands until Floyd, 90, passed away first on February 11.

Five hours later he was followed by his wife Violet, 89.

Floyd and Violet Hartwig from Easton, California, began dating in the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II

'We felt blessed because we knew that's what they wanted,' daughter Donna Scharton told The Fresno Bee.

The couple first met in elementary school, but didn't began dating until the 1940s while Floyd was on leave from the Navy during World War II.

While Floyd was away, the love-struck youngsters kept in touch through letters.

The family still has 131 of the letters Floyd and Violet wrote to each other between 1946 and 1948. On at least one occasion, Floyd wrote to Violet five times in one day.

'Hi honey, just a few lines from this lonely blue sailor of yours. Miss you darling and so in love with you. … Honey, I'll sure be glad when I get out of this. 

'It sure isn't for me, though at one time I thought the Navy was pretty swell. That was before I fell in love with the sweetest girl in the world,' he wrote in May 1947 while stationed in the Pacific.

The couple married in August 1947, although it would be several months before Floyd was discharged from the Navy.

In December 1947, newlywed Violet wrote to Floyd: 'Need your arms around me darling, hope it will be soon honey. All my love darling and take care of yourself. Love you, love you, and shall always love only you, honey, as long as I live. Your loving wife, forever.'

Once reunited permanently the couple settled down to life on their 20-acre ranch and went on to have three children together: Donna, Carol and Kenneth.

In their later years, Violet had dementia and suffered a number of strokes while Floyd battled colon and bladder cancer and eventually was diagnosed with kidney failure just two weeks before his death.

Even though Floyd couldn't get around well towards the end, his wife was always his priority.

'He would tell the doctor, 'I'm OK, I want Vi fixed,'' their daughter recalled.

Scharton got emotional when she told The Fresno Bee about the day of her parents joint funeral. 

'When we went to the funeral home and saw the two caskets, it was meant to be,' she said. 'And that's the only way it could end.'
