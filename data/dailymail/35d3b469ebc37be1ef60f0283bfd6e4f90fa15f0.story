Riot-gear clad police
arrested at least 17 people on Sunday after they refused orders
to disperse from a spontaneous sit-in outside a convenience
store in St. Louis during a weekend of otherwise peaceful
protests against police violence.

Thousands of people are staging protest marches, vigils and
other demonstrations in the St. Louis area this weekend, calling
for the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an
unarmed black teenager in August.

Another fatal shooting of an African-American teenager by an
off-duty cop last Wednesday has further inflamed tensions.
Sunday's arrests were in the same neighborhood where Wednesday's
shooting occurred.

Thousands of people took to the streets of the midwestern US city of St Louis to protest police tactics in the wake of the racially charged shooting of an unarmed black teenager

Civil rights organizations, protest groups and people from around the country were protesting the August 9 shooting of Brown, which involved Ferguson Police officer Darren Wilson in the suburban town of Ferguson near St. Louis

Protesters clashed with police at a St Louis gas station convenience store early Sunday, hours after a peaceful day of marches and rallies marking two months since the fatal police shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown 

St. Louis police spokeswoman Schron Jackson said 17 people
had been arrested for unlawful assembly early on Sunday at the
parking lot of the QuikTrip convenience store.

Mervyn Marcano, who is handling media relations for a group
that provides jail support for protesters, said at least 19
people had been arrested.

St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson tweeted during the protest
that protesters were throwing rocks at the police. But the 
protesters tweeted that they had not thrown anything.

Witnesses transmitting live video from the small overnight
protest in Shaw, a neighborhood of St. Louis, showed a few dozen
people sitting on the ground outside the convenience store and
said some people were hit with pepper spray and what appeared to
have been tear gas, though that could not be confirmed.

Last Wednesday, an off-duty white officer working for a
security firm shot dead 18-year-old Vonderrit Myers Jr. in the
Shaw neighborhood in what police described as a firefight.

There were no reports of arrests at protest rallies on
Saturday that drew thousands of people. The police have largely
adopted a non-confrontational stance and protest organizers work
to maintain order and a non-violent approach. 

The mother of Michael Brown, the 18-year-old shot dead on
August 9 by a white officer in Ferguson, Missouri, walked at the
front of a rally on Saturday evening in the suburb of Ferguson.

Lesley McSpadden, who has criticized Ferguson police, has
only rarely participated in protests. She eventually left the
group, which grew to over 1,000 people and moved on to Ferguson
police headquarters.

A group of about 200 marched on a QT (QuikTrip) in the Grove district, where some briefly staged a sit-in. A police car was attacked, prompting at least 10 arrests, and tear gas was released to disperse the crowd

St Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson said on Twitter to say that protesters were 'throwing rocks' at officers and that arrests had been made for 'continued illegal behavior'

The St. Louis Metropolitcan Police Department said its officers arrested 17 people for unlawful assembly in the QuickTrip parking lot

Brown's death triggered a national uproar in August over
police accountability and protesters have called for the arrest
and prosecution of the officer, Darren Wilson. A grand jury is
now considering the case.

At the culmination of the Ferguson march on Saturday night,
protesters shouted insults at a line of police in helmets and
shields, with some demonstrators wearing bandanas or scarves
over their faces. But there were no arrests or violence, a
police spokesman said.

Earlier on Saturday, thousands of protesters in downtown St.
Louis marched and rallied at a plaza, where organizers included
Hands Up United, an activist group that emerged after Brown's
death.

Union members, gay rights activists and people from the
Occupy movement joined in. Civil rights organizations and
protest groups had invited people from across the United States 
to join vigils and other weekend events in the St. Louis area.

'This isn't going to stop until there is change with police
and black youth,' said Tory Russell, a founder of Hands Up
United.

The St. Louis County Police Department said its officers made no arrests, despite 'a few occasions of assaultive behavior directed toward officers'

On Saturday, a 'Justice for All' march in the city's downtown culminated in a rally — both aimed at protesting Brown's death by a white officer and other acts of police brutality in the St. Louis region and across the country
