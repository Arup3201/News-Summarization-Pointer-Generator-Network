A drama teacher has been banned from teaching for life after putting an explicit short story which described a man having sex with underage girls into a 12-year-old's textbook.  

John Salway, 67, intentionally put the self-written fantasy story into the pupil's textbook at Mount St Mary's College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire, so she would find it, a professional conduct panel heard.

The short story - which the panel heard demonstrated a 'deep-seated and harmful attitude to children' - detailed a man having sex with two 15-year-old girls. It also referred to the man having sexual activity with a 12-year-old girl.

John Salway, 67, a drama teacher at Mount St Mary's College in Spinkhill, Derbyshire (pictured), wrote a graphic short story and slipped it into a 12-year-old girl's textbook 

Mr Salway said he wrote the story 'as a sexual fantasy for my own private gratification' but could not explain how it ended up in the girl's book. 

After reading it, the Year Seven pupil became worried, distressed and uncomfortable and she showed the story to her mother and father, the panel was told. 

Her distraught parents complained to the school's headmaster and the teacher's career was brought to an end. 

Mr Salway, who taught drama between 2011 and 2014, admitted at the hearing last month that he had demonstrated unacceptable professional conduct that could bring the profession into disrepute.

In a statement, he told the panel he had written the story 'as a sexual fantasy for my own private gratification' but did not explain how the story ended up in the book.

Dr Robert Cawley, who chaired the panel run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said the allegations 'demonstrate a deep-seated attitude to children which could lead to harmful behaviour'.

He added that it lead to a pupil being exposed to the behaviour in a harmful way.

Mr Salway, who has now been banned from the classroom for life, said he wrote the story for his own gratification but could not say how the words ended up in the book 

He said: 'The panel has determined that Mr Salway's actions were deliberate and there was no indication that he was acting under duress.'

Dr Cawley said the teacher - who was not present at the hearing - had a previously good history and had shown remorse early on.

But he said the case involved serious sexual misconduct and warranted an indefinite prohibition order. 

Alan Meyrick, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, said Mr Salway would be banned from the profession for life.

He said: 'This case is a serious one which involves behaviours that fall considerably short of those expected by the public of a teacher.

'Mr Salway wrote a story which itself evidenced a deep-seated and harmful attitude to children.

'Furthermore, the panel found that he deliberately caused a young pupil to read this story, causing distress to her and to her parents.'

Mr Salway, who was not present, was given 28 days in which to appeal against the decision to the High Court.

Mount St Mary's College is a Roman Catholic independent boarding school which was founded in 1842.

Past pupils have included the poet Gerald Manley Hopkins; Sir Denis Henry, Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland; Sir Diarmaid Conroy, former President of Industrial Tribunals for England & Wales; and Hugh Lofting, creator of Dr Doolittle.
