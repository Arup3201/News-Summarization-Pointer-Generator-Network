Tennis star Caroline Wozniacki has proved she is not just a hit on the Tennis court as she showed off her boxing skills in a short video posted on her Instagram account.

The 24-year-old, currently competing in the Dongfeng Motor Wuhan Open in China, is a long-term admirer of the sport, demonstrating this in a one-to-one workout with a personal trainer, believed to be after the most recent Wimbledon tournament.

Speaking to reporters in 2010 she said: 'Boxing, it's just a different way for me to work out.

'It's fun, it's interesting, and it's great because I have this great coach who knows how to get me in good shape and what I need for my tennis, as well.

'It's really hard not only physically, but also the conditioning. And, you know, it's great to have a coach there also who just pushes you to the limit,' she said.

Wozniacki will be looking to build on an encouraging summer with a win in China, after reaching her first Grand Slam final since 2009  earlier this month, losing out to Serena Williams in the US Open.
