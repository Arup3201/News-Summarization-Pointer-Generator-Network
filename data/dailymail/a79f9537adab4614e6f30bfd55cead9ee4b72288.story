Former Liverpool player Jason McAteer has warned Raheem Sterling he is being 'misguided' amid reports he will reject a contract worth £180,000-a-week to stay at Anfield.

Sterling's current Liverpool deal expires at the end of next season and Liverpool are keen to tie his long-term future to the club.

But manager Brendan Rodgers has said Sterling will not sign a new deal before the end of the season in order to focus on his football and reports now suggest Liverpool have their work cut out in order to keep him at the club beyond his current deal.

Speaking to talkSPORT, McAteer revealed his belief that the best thing for Sterling's career would be to stay at Liverpool under Rodgers.

'It's stop-start on these contract negotiations,' McAteer said. 'I just think he is being misguided somewhere along the line. 

'You know how the football world works, someone will be in his ear telling him this and that. I think he's just got to knuckle down and let his performances do the talking.'

The 20-year-old Sterling has been a near enough ever-present in the Liverpool team since Rodgers took over in 2012.

The Northern Irishman handed Sterling his first Premier League start and he has made 120 appearances for Liverpool so far in all competitions, scoring 22 goals.

McAteer is certain Sterling would be served best by staying under the guidance of Rodgers, who has overseen his transformation from a youth player to a key man for Liverpool and England.

'Liverpool is the right place for him, certainly for the next two or three seasons where he’s going to develop and play every week in the first team. He’s under a good manager and it’s a good young team as well.

'Brendan is a good young coach with great ideas who has worked with youngsters before. He’s a good man manager as well and Liverpool is a massive club.'

Sterling will miss England's friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday to recover from a toe injury but should be fit for Liverpool's game at Arsenal on Saturday at The Emirates.
