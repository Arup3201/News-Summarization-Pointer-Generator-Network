If your daily commute ever seems like a drag, console yourself with the thought that it is making you younger.

According to Einstein’s Theory of Relativity, time slows down as we speed up – meaning Tube travellers, for example, age less quickly.

The downside is that the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second.

Getting younger on the move: Tube travellers age less quickly, but the effects are tiny – a typical commute turns back time by just a few millionths of a millionth of a second

Even a Tube driver would not earn back a whole second by the end of their career.

Physicist Shane Bergin, of Trinity College Dublin, said: ‘Time isn’t constant. The faster you travel, the slower the second hand ticks for you. Imagine twins. Both of them are given very accurate clocks. One twin is sent on a train that travels at incredible speeds.

'Time isn't constant': Professor Shane Bergin was speaking at the American Association for the Advancement of Science's conference in San Jose

'The other remains at home, moving about at a speed far slower than the first twin. When the twin who travelled by train returns home, both twins compare the time on their clocks. Less time will have passed for the twin who took the train, relative to the twin who stayed at home.’

Professor Bergin told the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s conference in San Jose, California, yesterday that such insights would help ordinary people appreciate the beauty of physics.

And he pointed out that Tube travellers may not realise that they become lighter when taking the lift up from platform level.

‘You have weight because gravity is pulling you down,’ said the professor. ‘So when you are in a lift and you are being accelerated upwards, you are lighter because you are working against gravity.’

Another of Professor Bergin’s 12 insights was that Tube escalators are made of stardust – because almost everything on Earth is made up of elements formed billions of years ago at the heart of a star.

Spewed out into space when the star died, they eventually pulled together to make planets, people - and escalator materials.

Professor Bergin has launched the Dart of Physics project to try to popularise the subject.
