A stunning bikini made form pure gold and worth a cool £100,000 graced the catwalk in China this week.

Demonstrating skilled metalwork at its raciest, the fine filigree-style two-piece was made entirely from the precious metal.

It went on show during a fashion display in Nanjing, Jiangsu province, centred around the theme of gold.

The other models were decked out in novel gold accessories such as belts, necklaces and
 headpieces in keeping with the theme.

The
 centrepiece bikini featured bra cups shaped to fit the breast exactly, 
and separate pieces joined together by fine gold chains.

The metalwork pattern resembled detailed Oriental blooms within a paisley-like frame.

As the fine gold design did not cover the model adequately, she wore nude underwear beneath it.

Revellers were keen to snap a picture of the pretty model wearing the expensive bikini

The bikini is worth more than a million RMB (around £100,000) was displayed in a catwalk show on Wednesday

The main model was joined by an array of stunning Asian models wearing more novel gold-looking items

In fact, the barely-there bikini bottoms featured just a few straps of metal chain covering the nether regions, and appeared not to fit very well, sagging at the back.

If
 you're keen to step out in something luxe and precious this summer but 
can't quite cope with the price tag - or, indeed, the impracticalities -
 of the two-piece shown in China, here's our selection of glitzy swimwear.
