The scene has drawn plenty of attention but its unsure if it's the best kind. 

'The neighbors don't like it,' Dixon said. 'My father hates it and anything bad that happens he blames it on that. On the average we probably get 30 or 40 cars stop and taking pictures, getting out with their camera. People that follow zombie movies and and stuff like that love it.'
