An Ohio university student drowned trying to save his dog from an icy grave.

Kyle Miller, 21, was kayaking with his friend Austin Gifford, 19, on Saturday morning on one of the Darby Bend Lakes west of Columbus when his Scottish terrier who he had taken with him fell into the frigid waters.

The two men, neither of whom were wearing life jackets, tried desperately to reach the dog and in doing so, both kayaks capsized.

Animal lover: Kyle Miller, a 21-year-old university student, seen here with a baby big cat, drowned while trying to save his pet dog from an icy lake in Ohio

Kyle tried to hang on to his capsized boat but the water which was below freezing (30F or -1C) proved too much.

His strength quickly ebbed away and he went under around 11am, while Austin was able to swim to shore and seek help.

Kind eyes: Kyle Miller gave up his promising track and field career to work with animals and was intending to move to Alaska to do so

The Darby Bend Lakes area of the park is a former quarry and is up to 80 feet deep in places, and both Kyle and his dog were nowhere to be found.

Officers from the Ohio Division of Natural Resources Division of Watercraft used sonar equipment built specially for deep water to find Kyle’s body, which was recovered at 2pm on Sunday some 71 feet below the surface.

The dog’s body was also recovered on Sunday afternoon.

His family watched distraught as the rescuers brought his corpse to the surface. Understandably, they were too upset to talk to the waiting media.

Kyle, a student at the private Otterbein University and former track athlete, was reading zoo and conservation science. He had hoped to move to Alaska to work with animals.

‘He was a talented athlete and a great young man,’ Dave Lehman, his former coach, told the Columbus Dispatch. ‘We all feel fortunate to have known him.’

His lecturer Professor Anna Young was too upset to talk but released an email statement: ‘Kyle was always so calm and had such kind eyes. He would have been an excellent ambassador for wildlife. It’s tragedy to lose someone so young and passionate.’

Austin was released from the hospital Saturday night.
