Police say they have evidence that two sisters found dead last month in the Pittsburgh home they shared were killed by their next door neighbor.

Allen Wade, 43, turned himself in on Wednesday on charges including criminal homicide, robbery, theft and a firearms violation in the slayings of Susan Wolfe, 44, and Sarah Wolfe, 38, his former neighbors.

Wade claims he is innocent of any crime, but surveillance footage and DNA sample link him to the crime, police say.

'I'm 100 per cent innocent. I didn't do 
anything wrong,' Wade said as detectives took him from police 
headquarters to the Allegheny County Jail.

The two sisters of 
Democratic Rep. Mary Wolfe, of Clinton, Iowa, were found dead February 7 
after police were called to their residence when they didn't show up for
 work. Both women were found in the basement of the home they shared; 
each was shot once in the head, police said.

Sarah Wolfe, 38, was
 a psychiatrist for the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's 
Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. Susan Wolfe, 44, was a 
teacher's aide at Hillel Academy in the city's Squirrel Hill 
neighborhood.

In a criminal complaint, 
authorities suggested Wade attacked Susan Wolfe when she was home alone,
 based on surveillance video from a transit bus Susan Wolfe rode home, 
other video from Sarah Wolfe's employer and home alarm records that 
enabled detectives to reconstruct some of the sister's movements the 
night before they were found dead.

Susan Wolfe's body was found 
naked and doused with bleach and liquid detergent. Sarah Wolfe was 
likely killed when she returned home from work later that night, the 
video and alarm records suggest. She was found clothed but with a 
blanket over her head. Her purse had been emptied.

Police said 
items belonging to the sisters - identification cards, credit and bank 
cards, keys and cellphones - were missing.

According to TribLive.com, Wade is also accused of stealing these possessions.

The victims' bank accounts show that $600 was withdrawn using their debit cards after midnight on February 7.

A surveillance video recorded a person in gray sweatpants and bright white shoes at an ATM in East Liberty withdrawing money at that time.

The same person was captured on camera walking away from where Sarah Wolfe's car had been abandoned and toward the ATM.

The person is then shown removing the sweatpants near a Midas Muffler shop. Police recovered the pants and found a business card that belonged to an associate of Susan Wolfe in the pocket.

The man then walked to a Sunioco gas station at 1:08am and threw something into a garbage can then bought two packets of Newport cigarettes in the store.

Detectives later found a pen with 'Iowa' on it in the gas station's trash, police said, which is believed to be from the home of the Wolfe sisters.

The man from the surveillance footage was later identified as Wade.

DNA testing from a bloodstain on the sweatpants matched Wade, police told TribLive.com.

Police also found DNA from a 
male and a female under Susan Wolfe's fingernails, and lab tests 
determined Wade couldn't be excluded 'as a contributor to this mixture.'

Federal 
firearms records show Wade has bought eight handguns since 1997, but 
they can't account for three of the weapons. Police haven't discussed 
the type of gun used to kill the sisters.

Wade was questioned by police late last month but released. He denied wrongdoing at the time.

Lt.
 Kevin Kraus said Wade had since vacated the home next door to the 
Wolfes' residence and police were searching for him Wednesday before he 
turned himself in. They provided no other details on his surrender, 
though Kraus said police were alerted to Wade's plans by monitoring his 
Facebook page.

On it, Wade professed his innocence, writing, 'I 
would like for the world to know I am 100 percent innocent I would never
 ever in any way Hurt a person so brutally it is not in my nature I have
 always respected women and will always continue to do so I am being 
framed to take the fall for this case and hopefully justice will prevail

In a statement, Mary Wolfe said she was grateful for the Pittsburgh Police Department's efforts.

'I'm
 extremely appreciative of the hard work and dedication of the 
Pittsburgh law enforcement community and of the unwavering support my 
family and I have received,' she said.

On Thursday February 6, Susan went to 
work at the Hillel Academy at the normal time - about 7:25 a.m. - and 
left about 5 p.m., apologizing that she couldn't stay late because she 
had an appointment at 5:30.

'[Susan always went to work] eager to start the day, greeted the children at the door, read them 
books while waiting for other children to arrive ... Her smile was 
infectious. She approached every day with optimism,' Dori Oshlag, the director of the center, said.

On Friday, when Susan didn't show up for work, Oshlag got nervous and began calling her house about 8:20 a.m. but got no answer. Text messages and emails also went unanswered.

'And by noon, myself and the staff and administration realized we had to 
make a difficult call to ask for help. The rest is history,' she said.

By noon, Oshlag and other friends who'd noticed the women were missing, started calling police. Authorities performed a wellness check just after 1 p.m. and found the bodies.

Each sister was pronounced dead at 1:48 p.m. Friday.

Both sisters had an excellent reputation amongst those who knew them best.

Sarah Wolfe's boyfriend, Matthew Bucholz, posted a note on Facebook describing his deceased girlfriend as a 'beautiful, brilliant funny woman who worked as a children's 
psychiatrist and was an old school riot "grrrl."...This whole thing is 
unimaginably sad.'

Her former landlord described her as a dream tenant who often put her February rent in Valentines Day cards, and who baked cakes and brought them over to her house for no special reason.

'We were just so happy to have her,' former landlord Kelly Carter told the paper.. 'She turned out to be a model tenant and a model neighbor and friend.'

In November, Wolfe left her rental property and purchased the house on Chislett Street - where she and her sister were both found dead.

Shortly after moving in, Wolfe's house was burglarized, according to Carter, whom she asked for help fixing a broken window. Carter says she advised her to get a burglar alarm, although it's unclear whether she did.

Wade remained in police
 custody, awaiting arraignment Wednesday afternoon. Under Pennsylvania 
law, he cannot be released on bond because he's charged with homicide.

Multiple women have previously filed protection-from-abuse orders against Wade.

He was convicted of robbing a bank in Wilkinsburg and of simple assault for incidents that occurred in 2002.
