A New York writer has discovered that his stolen iPhone ended up in China - after photos of a stranger posing beside an orange tree started appearing on his iCloud.

Matt Stopera explained in an article on Buzzfeed how, a year after his phone was pinched from a Manhattan bar, he was scrolling through his pictures and started seeing images of the man and set off to investigate how the images had ended up there.

In a bizarre twist, the story has brought him fame across China, where internet users tracked down the man, dubbed Brother Orange - and Stopera now hopes to visit the country to meet him.

Stopera first noticed hundreds of unfamiliar photos on his phone a few weeks ago.

Bizarre: Buzzfeed writer Matt Stopera, pictured, said he was stunned when he learned his stolen iPhone had ended up in China - and that he was able to see photos a man there was snapping of himself

'I was going through my photos and I was like, "Oh my God, who is this person?"' he told CBS.

The photos included selfies of a man in front of orange trees, as well as images of fireworks, stores and menus - and Stopera guessed they had been taken from somewhere in Asia.

More images started appearing: people on motorbikes, children pointing at chickens and stock photos of models, plants and cars.

When he mentioned the bizarre happenings to a friend, they told Stopera that most stolen iPhones end up in China - and told him to go to an Apple store immediately.

'The next day, I went to the Apple Store and tried to explain to them that pictures from some guy in China were showing up on my phone,' he explained in his Buzzfeed article.

Strange: He first noticed the photos earlier this month - a year after the phone was snatched in Manhattan

Odd: Images of Chinese store fronts and firework displays began appearing on his phone's photo stream

'They were confused. I got sent around the store until some guy made me log into my iCloud account. Sure enough, there was my old iPhone on network. 

'That was it. There it was. My stolen iPhone had gone from the East Village to China. Incredible.'

He deleted everything from his old phone and was told that he should no longer have any trouble, although the phone would also stop working for Brother Orange.

'The reason his pictures were showing up on my current phone was because he must have been logged into my iCloud account,' he said.

But letting go wasn't easy.  

'To be honest, I was kind of upset about the whole thing,' Stopera wrote. 'I kind of liked getting his picture updates and as long as he couldn't access my info, I was OK with it.' 

Luckily, that was only just the beginning of their relationship. 

New-found fame: After sharing his story online, it was picked up in China. He joined Chinese social networking site, Weibo (pictured), and discovered that he had hundreds of messages of support from people

Found! After the story was shared, people managed to track down the man in the photographs

After sharing his story online, it was found by readers in China and shared on their version of Twitter, named Weibo. People started calling the anonymous man 'Brother Orange' because of the selfies beside the orange tree.

Stopera learned of his new-found internet fame in China when users contacted him to say the story had been viewed thousands of times across Weibo. 

Chinese internet users found out that the photos had been snapped in Guangdong and got to work finding out the real identity of Brother Orange. Stopera soon received a photo of his old iPhone.

'Apparently Orange Man’s nephew heard about the story and posted pictures of my phone and pictures of his uncle on Weibo,' Stopera wrote in a follow-up article.

A Chinese blogger connected the two and said that Brother Orange wanted to invite Stopera to his home and 'prepare the famous local food for you'. 

Life-changing: After contacting the man - known as Brother Orange because of his poses beside the orange tree in the photo feed - Stopera was invited to China and said he now hopes to visit the country

Stopera shared this image of him saying hello to his new friend in China and is now planning his trip

'Matt, you are welcome to come to my house to taste downight Meizhou Hakka vegetables,' Brother Orange wrote on Weibo in a message that has since been translated. 

Stopera said he is now planning a trip to China.

'I think it's actually going to happen,' he told CNN, adding that he has been overwhelmed by the kind messages he has received from so many Chinese internet users.

'It's getting me really excited to visit China,' he said. 'They've been so warm to me and so excited about the whole thing.'
