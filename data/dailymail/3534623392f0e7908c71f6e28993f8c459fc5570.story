A New York man doused a woman in lighter fluid before setting her face on fire - because she refused to return his $10, it is claimed.

William Norwood, 52, allegedly splashed the woman's face with the highly flammable fluid before flicking his lighter on near her face in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

The two are said to have been quarreling over money.

He then fled the house in Tremont, in the Bronx, while the woman was rushed to the nearby Jacobi Medical Centre.

The 48-year-old woman had sustained second degree burns to her face and hands, and officials said her hair was singed.

Norwood's mother Nora - who witnessed part of the argument - told the New York Daily News the fight had started over money.

'She said something like, "I didn’t take no money, I don’t have the $10",' Ms Norwood said. 

'She said, "You had it. I didn’t take it".’

However, she also said her son claimed the woman had set herself on fire, according to The New York Post.

'I saw her burns and they looked really awful,' Ms Norwood, 79, added.

Her son was eventually arrested shortly after midnight on Thursday.

Norwood has been charged with attempted murder, assault and criminal possession of a weapon, police have said.
