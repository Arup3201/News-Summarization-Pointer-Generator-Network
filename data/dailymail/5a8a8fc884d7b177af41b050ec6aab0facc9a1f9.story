Derry Mathews’ world title shot has been put on hold after the champion Richar Abril withdraw from the fight due to a viral infection.

Mathews was due to fight for the WBA World Lightweight title on March 6 at Liverpool’s Echo Arena, but Abril has been suffering from a viral infection, possibly Dengue Fever, and has been unable to train and has received medical advice not to fight.

The Cuban’s lawyer, Gregory Bloom, has asked for a postponement for the fight while Abril recovers and is able to resume full training again. Bloom said they are committed to giving Mathews his world shot and promoter Frank Warren is looking at rescheduling the fight at the earliest opportunity.

Bloom said, ‘We definitely want to have Abril defend his title against Derry Mathews and it is our hope that we can reschedule the fight for early April or as close to that time frame as possible.’

Warren added: ‘It’s very unfortunate that this has happened and Derry will have to wait just a little longer to get his world title opportunity.

‘We hope that Richar recovers from his viral infection quickly and is able to get back into training to defend his title against Derry as soon as possible, which we are all really looking forward to.’

The show will still go ahead with Paul Butler’s IBF World Super-Flyweight title challenge against Zolani Tete headlining an action-packed card that includes Merseyside stars Kevin Satchell, Liam Smith and Jazza Dickens, plus Lancashire hot shot Jack Catterall all in big title action, and local favourites Tom Stalker and Stephen Lewis also on the card.
