Andrew Mitchell faces the humiliation of a Commons vote on whether his pay should be docked for swearing at police.

Labour yesterday tabled a motion that could see the Tory Chief Whip lose £1,000 after police claimed he called them ‘****ing plebs’ for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street.

That is the amount Mr Mitchell could have been fined if, like most people who swear at a police officer, he had been successfully prosecuted.

Under-fire: Labour tabled a motion that could see Andrew Mitchell lose £1,000 after police claimed he called them '****ing plebs' for refusing to let him cycle through the main gates of Downing Street

Labour is expected to force a vote 
during the next opposition day debate – a move that could expose the 
lack of support for Mr Mitchell among Lib Dem MPs and some Tories.

Home Secretary: Theresa May said the police officers involved had accepted Mr Mitchell's apology 'and that is an end to it'

Mr Mitchell has repeatedly denied 
calling diplomatic protection officers ‘plebs’ but he has admitted 
swearing, and London Mayor  Boris Johnson has said it would have been 
‘commonsensical’ for Mr Mitchell to be arrested.

Under Section 5 of the Public Order 
Act, guidelines for  magistrates suggest that anyone convicted of the 
offence faces a fine equivalent to between 50 and 125 per cent of their 
weekly income.

Mr Mitchell’s salary as Chief Whip is more than £79,000 and his weekly income from it is around £1,500.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who tabled 
the motion to dock Mr Mitchell’s pay, said: ‘We still don’t know what 
exactly Andrew Mitchell said to the police  officers, nor has he offered
a proper apology.

'If the Prime Minister won’t act to clean up this mess then Parliament should do it for him.’

As Mr Mitchell took his place on the 
government frontbench yesterday for the first time since his outburst 
last month, he faced jeers from opposition MPs.

And in the first public criticism from
his own party, former Tory whip Michael Fabricant, who returned to the 
backbenches in  last month’s reshuffle, said that Mr Mitchell’s 
predecessor Patrick McLoughlin, now Transport Secretary, is ‘sorely 
missed as Chief Whip’. And during  Home Office questions, Labour MPs 
repeatedly demanded that ministers condemn Mr Mitchell’s behaviour.

Talks: Mr Mitchell met Police Federation officials at his constituency office in Sutton Coldfield on Friday

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper 
sought to embarrass Home Secretary Theresa May by quoting her own words 
to the Police Federation last year in which she said: ‘It’s easy to sit 
round with friends and criticise the police. You put up with abuse and 
worse, but you do so to keep us free. It’s time we gave you all the 
respect you deserve.’

'We still don’t know what 
exactly Andrew Mitchell said to the police  officers, nor has he offered
a proper apology. If the Prime Minister won’t act to clean up this mess then Parliament should do it for him'

Labour MP Simon Danczuk

Miss Cooper called for Mrs May to 
condemn Mr Mitchell, but she refused. The Home Secretary said: ‘The 
Chief Whip apologised to the police officers concerned and the police 
accepted that apology. The police are not taking the matter any further,
and that is an end to it.’ Mr Mitchell roared ‘Hear, hear!’ as Mrs May 
came to his defence.

A Downing Street spokesman made clear 
the Prime Minister has dug in his heels and is determined to hold on to 
his Chief Whip. He said: ‘Andrew Mitchell behaved in a way that he 
shouldn’t have towards a police officer, but he has apologised and that 
apology has been accepted.’

Mr Mitchell faces a further ordeal 
tomorrow when he will sit next to David Cameron during Prime Minister’s 
Questions when he will inevitably be made the butt of Ed Miliband’s 
attacks on the Government. And, also tomorrow, Tory MPs are expected to 
complain about Mr Mitchell’s behaviour during a meeting of the backbench
1922 Committee.
