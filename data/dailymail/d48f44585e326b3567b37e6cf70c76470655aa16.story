Under pressure: Sir David Nicholson has faced renewed calls to resign

The much-criticised head of the NHS insisted today that he had to travel first-class to do his job.

Sir David Nicholson racked up nearly £50,000 in expenses claims last year on top of his £211,000 annual salary.

Yet he refused to explain to a committee of MPs why he has apparently been billing the taxpayer to go home to his wife at weekends by first-class rail travel.

Sir David is defying growing calls to resign over his role in the Mid Staffordshire Hospital scandal, where hundreds died through neglect at a time when he was head of the regional health body.

The Prime Minister has insisted he is doing ‘a very good job’, but many MPs, and some senior members in the Department of Health, believe his position is untenable.

He was quizzed by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee over his expenses which last year totalled £48,900 – the cost of employing two nurses for a year.

Intriguingly, they included 41 first-class trips to Birmingham, where his 35-year-old wife lives with their baby daughter.

Sir David, 57, had claimed on his expenses forms to be ‘attending an official meeting’.

But many of the trips took place on a Friday, prompting speculation he was billing the taxpayer to see his wife at the weekend.

Public dislike: Protestors campaign for the resignation of Sir David Nicholson on Abingdon Green, London

There have been repeated calls for the NHS chief executive to resign since the Mid-Staffs hospital scandal where hundreds of patients died needlessly after being 'routinely neglected'

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the 
committee, yesterday asked Sir David: ‘Were you paid by the taxpayer for
first-class travel on Fridays to Birmingham?’

He refused to answer the question 
directly and replied: ‘To do that job I had to travel a lot around the 
country and spent two or three nights away from home. It was simply 
impossible for me to do, without being able to work during that period, 
get value out of my time. The only way I could guarantee that is to have
first-class travel. I have been open and transparent about it. My 
employers completely understand why I do it.’

Mrs Hodge pressed him further and said: ‘Some of us manage to work without travelling first-class I have to say that to you.

In fact, train journeys are a really 
good place for most of us to work without travelling first-class. What 
raises eyebrows is that you were going home on a Friday.’

Sir David refused to deny that he had
indeed been claiming expenses to go home at the weekend. Instead, he 
stated: ‘I agreed with my department in 2010 I would have three working 
bases – Birmingham, London and Leeds – and my travel to all those places
would be paid for to enable me to do all the three jobs.’

Mrs Hodge replied: ‘Well at a time when we’re all in this together I think you should reconsider whether it’s appropriate.’

Over the last four years Sir David has been instructing the NHS to make total savings of £20billion.
Although Sir David claimed to be working from Birmingham, his offices 
are in London, the headquarters of the Department of Health, and Leeds, 
the headquarters of the NHS Commissioning Board.

He married Sarah-Jane Marsh, the 
£155,000 head of Birmingham Children’s Hospital, last year after 
divorcing his first wife. She gave birth to a girl three months ago.

■ Sir David admitted that 44 whistleblowers have been gagged by the NHS this year despite the fact these clauses are now ‘void’.

Asked about 400 departing staff 
having been handed the agreements in recent years and paid £15million 
for their silence, he said the agreements were no longer valid, raising 
the prospect of a flood of damaging stories about poor care being made 
public.
