Hard-line Christian reality TV star Phil Robertson took a religious stance on ISIS in an interview Tuesday, while failing to concede that his solution looks eerily like the Islamist group's.

'Convert them or kill them,' Robertson told Fox News on Tuesday after Sean Hannity asked for the Duck Dynasty patriarch's take on the group currently waging a religious war across the Middle East.

While the Millionaire duck hunter neglected to consider the irony of his words, he did suggest that only one of the possibilities would likely work.

'At war with us': Robertson's take on ISIS came as he was interviewed by Sean Hannity on Fox just hours after the US authenticated the second video of an American beheading by ISIS

'[Converting them} I think would be next to impossible,' admitted the 68-year-old. 

Robertson called the terror group 'street thugs on steroids,' during the Fox interview which came as the Louisianan tours the country to drum up publicity for his new book unPHILtered, which came out Tuesday.

Robertson's Fox appearance came just hours after US officials verified the authenticity of Steven Sotloff's beheading--the second such horrific video made by ISIS militants.

Robertson quoted the Bible, as he often does, in the interview. He did the same thing in an earlier ABC News interview as he defended himself in the wake of criticism for controversial stances on gays and African-Americans.

'I'm as much of a homophobe as Jesus was,' Robertson said. 'The people who are participating in homosexual behavior, they need to know that I love them.'

He also addressed controversial remarks he's made about blacks.

'There's one race on this planet. It's called the human race,' he told ABC. 'We're all the same. To me, there is absolutely nothing that has color to do with it.'

Robertson was on Fox, in part, to give his take on matters of massive global importance like ISIS, he's not one to follow the news--at least not if it involves using internet.

‘I don't own a cell phone. I've never turned on a computer in my life,’ he said this week.

While the admission doesn't give the controversial man much credibility on matters of state, it does allow him to enjoy his millions with his peace of mind intact.

‘So whatever America is saying or not saying about me, true or untrue, what they need to understand is I'm not hearing it,' he continued.
