Spanish football authorities could take the unprecedented step of closing part of one of its top club's stadiums after supporters sung a song that glorified domestic abuse.

The Anti-violence Committee held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning at the ministry for Sport's headquarters and has written to the Spanish FA strongly recommending the closure of the 'South End' of Real Betis' Benito Villamarín stadium.

Betis is one of Spain's most famous clubs, currently lying third in the second division and coached by former West Brom manager Pepe Mel, but it was disgraced by its own supporters at the weekend when a section of spectators behind the goal sang songs in support of striker Ruben Castro.

The 33-year-old forward was charged in December with four counts of domestic violence and sending a threatening text message to his former partner.

In Saturday's game between Betis and Girona Betis supporters sang 'Rubén Castro alé, Ruben Castro alé, no fue tu culpa, era una p***, lo hiciste bien' which translates as 'Ruben Castro, it was not your fault, she was a w****, you did the right thing'.

A league official has reported the abusive chant – heard in Betis' last two games – to the League who informed the Anti-violence committee on Tuesday and they are now urging the Spanish FA to take action.

Ever since a Deportivo supporter was murdered in fighting outside of the Vicente Calderon Stadium last November the football authorities in Spain have ordered a crackdown on behaviour in and around stadiums.

The zero-tolerance policy has been open to ridicule at times with Barcelona supporters reported for singing 'Ronaldo is a drunk' and Madrid fans brought to book over a song about Lionel Messi.

But the country has united in disgust at the Betis' fans behaviour. El Mundo reported in January that last year 51 women were murdered by their current or former partners. And at the end of 2013 the same newspaper reported that 700 women had died through domestic violence in the last decade.
