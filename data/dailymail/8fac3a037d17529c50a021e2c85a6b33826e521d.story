The Shield actor waived his right to a preliminary hearing in August, meaning that the case will proceed to trial without an initial presentation of evidence to a judge. 

The couple's sons, both under 10, were home at the time and unharmed. The boys are now living with relatives.

Police have not disclosed a motive for the slaying but have said they were looking into whether financial or other domestic issues may have been involved.

The family of April Jace has called her death a senseless act of domestic violence. 

Police said Michael Jace called 911 to report the killing in their home in the Hyde Park suburb of the city.

Audio of Jace's call has not been made public, but fire officials have released a 911 call from April Jace's father in which he says the actor told him he had shot the victim.

Mrs Jace was discovered in the couple's home dead from multiple gunshot wounds to the upper torso.

According to court records obtained by ABC 7, Michael Jace was involved in a domesitc dispute with his first wife in 1997.

He also appeared in the TV show Southland and had small parts in such classics as Boogie Nights, Forrest Gump and Planet of the Apes.

He is being held on $2million bail, which his attorney indicated the jailed actor cannot pay.
