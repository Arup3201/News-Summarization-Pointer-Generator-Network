One of the BBC's top political reporters has given up her 25-year career in journalism to join a convent of nuns called the Adoration Sisters.

Northern Ireland political reporter Martina Purdy, who has been with the BBC for 15 years, announced her decision to become a nun and focus on 'new challenges' last week.

She was then photographed at the weekend dressed casually on her way to Sunday Mass at St Peter's Cathedral, Belfast, alongside six members of the Adoration Convent.

In a statement posted on her Twitter page, she said: 'I've been a journalist now for almost 25 years, 15 of them at the BBC.

'It has been an immensely rewarding profession and I'm very grateful for all the support I've had over many years from colleagues, family, contacts and friends.

Ms Purdy added: 'I know many people will not understand this decision. It is a decision that I have not come to lightly, but it is one that I make with love and great joy. I ask for prayers as I embark on this path with all humility, faith and trust.'

She went on to ask that the privacy of the Adoration Sisters - a self-described 'contemplative community' which makes altar breads - be respected as she faces 'the new challenges' of her life.

She went on to offer her thanks via Twitter to those who had shown their support for her decision

After which she added she wouldn't be giving a 'running commentary' on her new lifestyle

Following the announcement she tweeted: 'Thanks all for your generosity - from those of my faith, other faiths, those trying to find Him, those trying to ignore Him. God bless you.'

And in a final tweet, she added: 'I'm not planning a running commentary - but I'm truly overwhelmed. x.'

Ms Purdy, who was born in Belfast but brought up in Canada, joined the BBC Northern Ireland in 1999 after working as a newspaper journalist.

She was known as a familiar figure in the Northern Ireland Assembly at Stormont, covering Northern Irish politics for television and radio.

Kathleen Carragher, head of news for BBC Northern Ireland, paid tribute to Ms Purdy, saying: 'We will miss her wit and wisdom. I wish her happiness and fulfilment in her new life.'
