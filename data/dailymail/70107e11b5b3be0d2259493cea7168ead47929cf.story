Aston Villa are monitoring 20-year-old Rangers starlet Lewis MacLeod.

Club scouts saw him impress against Alloa Athletic on Saturday in the Scottish Championship match and he created Rangers’ goal in a 1-1 draw which keeps them in the hunt for a third successive automatic promotion.

The midfielder gained his first call-up to the full Scotland squad for the qualifier against Ireland last week and tonight’s friendly clash with England but was released by Gordon Strachan to play for his club on Saturday.

MacLeod earned his first Scotland call-up and could feature on the bench against England

He could feature on the bench against Roy Hodgson’s men at Celtic Park with scouts keen to see how he handles any step up.

Despite MacLoed shining, Ally McCoist's men were booed off against Alloa. Kris Boyd and David Templeton missed great chances for the Light Blues in an otherwise limp first-half

They continued to struggle after the break but it looked like they would escape with three points when skipper Lee McCulloch scored in the 78th minute, but Alloa equalised through Liam Buchanan.
