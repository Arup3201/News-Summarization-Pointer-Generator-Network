Scientists say they have figured out a way to determine an entire city's sense of humor and have come up with a list of the 10 funniest cities in America.

Although, if you think New York City and Los Angeles - cities typically known for their comedy clubs and improv schools - top the list, think again.

The top three funniest cities in America are Chicago, Boston and Atlanta, respectively - according to researchers at the University of Colorado's Humor Research Lab.

Hardy-har: Chicago has been ranked as the funniest city in America, over legendary comedy towns like New York City and Los Angeles

Bean Town: Touring comedians rank Boston high on their lists in terms of quality of audience, which is part of the reason it got the number two spot

Hot-lanta: It may not seem like it, but Atlanta, Georgia, is the third funniest city in America, according to science

'I think what ends up happening is that the nature of New York City is 
at a bit of an advantage when it comes to humor, but it’s also at a 
disadvantage because there’s a lot of things to do in new York that 
pulls the population in different directions,' Peter McGraw, the 
professor who created the algorithm as part of “The Humor Code,” a new 
book about what makes things funny, and why, told ABC News.

According to McGraw, New York was near the top of the list in terms of a city that relies on humor to cope with stress. Additionally, the city is home to some comedic institutions, like Saturday Night Live and the Upright Citizens Brigade improv school.

New York is also home to several late-night talk shows like the Late Show, The Daily Show, The Tonight Show and The Colbert Report, to name a few.

McGraw also says that New York is a good place for a young comedian to get their start, given the large number of comedy clubs in the Big Apple.

Poor showing: New York City wasn't even ranked in the top five, coming in sixth in the rankings for America's funniest cities

"'If you want to continue training, go to New York,’” McGraw quoted comedian Marc Maron telling him. “‘If you think you’re ready to get in the ring, go to L.A.’”

But McGraw says comedy isn't for everyone in New York the way it is in other cities.

'We wanted to look at not just what are the commercial and entertainment aspects of the comedy but how much the locals value it,' McGraw said.

McGraw also explained how Boston isn't necessarily known for its comedy scene, but that touring comedians rate audiences in Boston amongst the highest in any city in America. 

In Chicago - which topped McGraw's list - there are several comedy troupes - like The Second City - that are favorites of many of the locals.

Hollywood: Despite being home to some legendary comedy clubs, Los Angeles ranked seventh on the list

And Second City has put out its share of comedic stars - SNL has fed off of the troupe for more than 40 years, making stars out of Second City alums like John Belushi, Gilda Radner, Bill Murray and Chris Farley.

Soon-to-be Late Show host Stephen Colbert also is an alum of Chicago's Second City.

Because quantifying something like humor is tough - if not impossible - to do, McGraw says he's confident in his rankings and says they were compiled with a great deal of debate over how to measure certain aspects of a city and make it fair for all cities. 

In addition to analyzing a city's professional comedy scene, McGraw also polled people on things like how much their workplaces valued humor.

'I want people to want to be number one because this is such an 
important part of life,' he said. 'Who wouldn’t want to live in the city
 that is ranked as the funniest?'
