It was one of the most memorable moments of legendary wildlife presenter Sir David Attenborough's Frozen Planet series.

But scenes which apparently showed a polar bear giving birth in the wild saw the BBC accused of fakery by furious viewers after it was revealed that the footage had in fact been shot in a Dutch zoo.

And little more than a year on the Corporation seems keen to avoid making a similar mistake again.

Sir David will explicitly make it clear to viewers when footage from his forthcoming Africa series has not been filmed in the wild in order to 'maintain trust and credibility', say BBC producers.

Wild thing: Sir David Attenborough goes nose to nose with a young rhino in his new BBC2 series Africa. He will explicitly explain to viewers when 'controlled filming' is used after a fakery row

The new BBC2 series, which includes scenes which show how the shoebill bird deliberately lets its youngest chick die by depriving it of food, will see warnings that 'controlled filming' has been used included in Sir David's commentary.

Series producer James Honeybourne told the Radio Times: 'Because of the reactions to the polar bears being filmed for Frozen Planet it was appropriate to be more explicit... we feel it is important to maintain trust and credibility with the audience.

'What's important to us is to be able to share great moments of animal nature, and some controlled filming allows us to do that.

He added: 'We know that the audience wants to know, and we don't have a problem with it. We're not embarrassed about it, we're absolutely proud of it.'

Africa explores some of the lesser-known stories of the continent's wildlife and features the shoebill, which hatches two eggs and deprives the younger one of food and drink.

Crews spent four weeks trying to find a shoebill nest and then had to drag canoes full of camera equipment through a swamp for two days to complete the filming.

Mr Honeybourne added that the scenes featuring the youngest chick being starved have never been witnessed in such detail before.

The scenes that saw the BBC at the centre of the fakery controversy last year from episode five of its Â£16million Frozen Planet series featured the tiny polar bears mewling and nuzzling for milk from their mother.

Eight million viewers believed that the scenes were shot by cameramen who had endured sub zero temperatures in an underground cave in the arctic wilderness.

The scenes, however, had been shot in a mocked up cave made of plaster and wood and in a zoo enclusure in Holland.

It was not the first time that Sir David's shows were the target of fakery accusations.

In 1997, in the most memorable scene of Polar Bear, Arctic Warrior, a mother bear was filmed giving birth to and snuggling with her newborn cub.

Viewers were led to believe the scene took place in the Arctic. In fact, it was filmed in a zoo in Frankfurt, Germany.

Not as it seems: The 'den' in the wildlife park was constructed out of plaster and wood, built below the zoo's polar bear enclosure. It was fitted with cameras shortly before the birth

In 2001, Sir David was accused of 
using deceptive techniques in Blue Planet when it included a lobster 
spawning scene that was filmed in a British aquarium.

Viewers were led to believe the scene was taking place off the coast of Nova Scotia.

And
in 2008, Sir David was accused of staging a confrontation between 
himself and a cobra in a South African desert for the series, Life in 
Cold Blood.

Sir David's latest series Africa was filmed over four years to produce with crews in the field for 1,500 days gathering footage.

They travelled from hidden jungles and icy glaciers to erupting volcanoes to capture their incredible images.

Although
some of the scenes may be subject to 'controlled filming' there can be 
no doubt that the team that put the series together got up close and 
personal with some amazing animals.

As
well as the shoebill, Africa also features scenes showing a baby turtle
hatching on a beach on Comoros Islands off the coast of Mozambique.

Those scenes took three weeks to shoot.

And
cameramen risked life and limb when they climbed on top of a dead whale
carcass to film 30 great white sharks feasting on it off South Africa's
east coast.
