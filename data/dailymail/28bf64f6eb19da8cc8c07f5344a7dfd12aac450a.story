Millwall first-team coach Marc Bircham and Blackburn counterpart Craig Short have been served with a Football Association misconduct charge following Tuesday's fiery 2-2 draw at The Den.

Bircham and Short were sent to the stands after a touchline scuffle involving staff from both teams following a challenge by Millwall's Andy Wilkinson on Rovers winger Ben Marshall.

Wilkinson was shown a straight red card for the foul, although Millwall have since launched an appeal against the decision.

Lions boss Ian Holloway was also sent from the touchline later in the game for contesting another decision, but he has escaped a charge.

An FA statement read: "Marc Bircham and Craig Short, first-team coaches of Millwall and Blackburn Rovers respectively, have been charged by the FA following the fixture between the two clubs on November 4, 2014.

"The FA alleges that the behaviour of both Bircham and Short during the game amounted to improper conduct. Both have until 6pm on 10 November 2014 to respond to the charge.

"Meanwhile, Millwall manager Ian Holloway has formally been reminded by the FA of his responsibilities also in relation to his behaviour during this fixture."
