Guilty: Former Iceland Prime Minister Geir Haarde was today convicted for failing to hold cabinet meetings as the economy collapsed

The former Prime Minister of Iceland has been found guilty of negligence over the country's 2008 financial collapse.

Geir Haarde, 61, was convicted for failing to hold emergency cabinet meetings as the economy went into meltdown.

But he was cleared of three other more serious charges and will avoid jail.

Haarde was the first world leader to face prosecution in connection with the global banking crisis.

More than Â£3billion was lost by British savers, councils and charities when the banks collapsed.

The UK government is still trying to claw back money through the courts.

Haarde led the Icelandic government between 2006 and 2009.

He smiled and shook hands with supporters after the judgment was announced today.

The 15 members of the Landsdomur, a 
special court founded in 1905 to deal with criminal charges against 
Icelandic government ministers, returned a 500-page verdict, but only a 
brief summary was announced in public.

His expenses for defending the case are to be met by the Icelandic state.

Haarde, who pleaded not guilty to all charges, could have faced up to two years in prison.

After the verdict, he said: 'In my opinion and let me say this clearly, I believe the majority of the judges have succumbed to political pressure in the case and decided to offer the prosecution a small consolation price to justify this low and costly process.

'The count of which I am found guilty has nothing to do with the origins of the financial crisis or the way I dealt with it.'

He said he was considering appealing to the European Court of Human Rights on the conviction.

'I am found partially guilty for not discussing the financial situation in the markets frequently enough at cabinet meetings in the period leading up to the crisis in the period leading up to the crisis in 2008,' he said.

'This is obviously a purely formalistic charge. It has nothing to do with the banking crisis as such.

'I can tell you that I have always found this charge to be even more ridiculous than the others.'

Haarde originally faced six charges, but two were dismissed in October.

Iceland's banking sector ballooned to nine times the nation's annual gross domestic product in a decade of boom, before collapsing under the weight of debt in October 2008.

The country's three main banks collapsed in a single week.

Haarde was convicted of failing to take the initiative to ensure 'a comprehensive and professional analysis of the financial risk faced by the state because of the risk of financial crisis.'

He was cleared of malfeasance, of neglecting to act to reduce the size of the banking system, of not making sure that national bank Landsbanki's Icesave interest accounts in Britain were transferred to a subsidiary, and of failing to produce better results from the government's 2006 report on financial stability and preparedness.

Testifying in March, Haarde said neither he nor financial regulators knew the real state of Icelandic banks' precarious finances until they collapsed.

'The bankers did not realize that the situation was as dire as it was,' Haarde said. 'It was not until after the crash that everyone saw it coming.'

The special court included five supreme court justices, a district court president, a constitutional law professor and eight people chosen by parliament.

Haarde, the former leader of the Independence Party, became a hated symbol of the bubble economy for Icelanders who lost their jobs and homes in the crash.

He testified that the size of the bank would not have been a problem if not for their recklessness and a worldwide squeeze on credit, which also brought down major banks in the United States and Europe.
