It's less than a week since she was seen leaving the funeral of her brother Mark Shand in tears but the Duchess of Cornwall smiled bravely today as she visited wounded servicemen at RAF Leeming.

Camilla, 66, beamed as she was greeted outside the base by cheering children waving Union flags but looked more fragile than usual as she toured the North Yorkshire airfield.

During her visit, which was arranged to mark the opening of a new medical centre, the Duchess met wounded personnel, among them Corporal Paul Bentley-Crane, who showed the royal how some of the state-of-the-art equipment is used.

Another 'injured' serviceman to greet the Duchess was Leading Aircraftsman Nathan Hart, who shook hands with the 66-year-old from the comfort of one of the brand new beds.

Camilla, who was wearing a pale green coat and a pair of neat tan court shoes, later shook hands with a group of excited children who had waited outside to meet her.

Mr Shand, the Duchess of Cornwall's younger brother, died in a freak accident in New York last month.

The 62-year-old conservationist and travel writer had been hosting a charity auction on behalf ofÂ  Elephant Family at Sotheby's but slipped and struck his head on the pavement as he tried to re-enter the Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel through a revolving door after going for a drink with a relative.

His funeral, which was attended by 180 mourners, including the Prince of Wales and MP Zac Goldsmith, took place at the Holy Trinity Church in Stourpaine, Dorset last Thursday.

During the service, Camilla was comforted by her husband Prince Charles who wrapped a protective arm around her as they walked into church.

Since his death, donations to Elephant Family, an NGO that campaigns on behalf of the endangered Asian elephant, have soared, while tributes flooded in from friends and family members.

One of the most touching came from Camilla's son, Tom Parker-Bowles, who described Mr Shand, simply, as 'the greatest uncle a boy could have'.
