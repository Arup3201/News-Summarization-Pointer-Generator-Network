Bus passengers ganged up on some French tourists, even threatening to kill them, on an Australian bus after they started singing a French song.

A shocked passenger caught the racist outburst as several people hurled verbal abuse at four French girls on a bus in Melbourne on Sunday at 10.30pm.

As they sang, a female passenger started chanting ‘Aussie, Aussie, Aussie’. Appearing to misunderstand the chants as playful, one of the French girls sings louder.

Yelling abuse: This passenger was one of several who yelled abuse at four French girls on board a bus in Melbourne after they sung a French song

In response, passengers then start 
shouting racist abuse towards the girls, threatening to attack them 
before a bus window is smashed.

One passenger threatens to ‘cut the b***h’s t*ts off’ with a fishing knife offered to him by another passenger.

Another can be heard to say 'speak English or die motherf***er'.

Watch the racist attack on board the bus

Australian Mike Nayna filmed the whole frightening ordeal on his mobile phone and said one of the offenders was an ‘obviously drunk man’.

The stand-up comedian from Melbourne said: ‘It was a mob mentality it was sad to see. They were looking for an excuse to get angry. It was a sad state of affairs.

‘The older crowd were accepting of the racism and the younger crowd were excited, it's like they were showing off to each other.

‘Someone handed him a beer and said you can use my knife, it was this weird camaraderie, between three separate groups.

‘If it's one person going on a rant that's different, but if three people bond over it, you know the sentiment is wrong.’

Shocked at scare tactics: Australian passenger Mike Nayna caught the incident on his mobile phone which saw this man yelling at the girls before a bus window was smashed

As the abuse continued, the girls moved to the back of the bus.

In the clip, a passenger is heard shouting: ‘I'll f*****g box cutter you right now doll. 

‘You've been told about four times, get off. Everyone on the bus wants to kill you and you're going to have to get off the bus eventually b***h have you worked that out yet?’

As one of the passengers gets off the
bus with a pram, the sound of a smashed window at the rear of the bus 
is heard in the clip.

Mr Nayna said the bus remained stationery for a few minutes before driving another 500 yards down the road to a replacement bus.

'Mob mentality': The girls are seen to be shepherded down the back of the bus in an attempt to avoid the offenders

When the bus stopped, the girls were shepherded off the bus by Mr Nayna and some other passengers before running away in terror.

Mr Nayna released the video publicly in the hope it would open up discussion about racism in Australia.

He said: ‘I don't think it's an issue with buses I think it's an issue on the whole, Australia is a loving country but this is an underlying problem.

‘I don't want to look like I'm bashing my country, I love my country, I just want this to be talked about as there is an underlying issue going on her here.’
