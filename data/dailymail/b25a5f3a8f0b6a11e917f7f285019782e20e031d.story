A man was caught on camera stealing two puppies from an Orlando pet shop by shoving them down his pants on Saturday.

CCTV footage shows the man first stealing an $800 pug puppy from The Puppy Spot on the 2500 block of East Colonial, leaving the store, then coming back in to take a $750 miniature dachshund puppy.

The dog thief came into the store with another man, a woman and a toddler.

Brazen: The thief lifts his shirt and shoves the $800 puppy into his pants

One of the store's 14 surveillance cameras captured the man picking up the pug puppy, pacing around with it briefly before lifting his white t-shirt, unzipping his trousers and shoving the tiny dog down his pants.

He zips up and glances around to make sure his dog act hasn't been witnessed.

He is then seen leaving the store calmly, and cameras outside the store show him putting the dog in his car.

He then re-enters the store and picks up a $750 dachshund puppy from its crib and puts that dog down his pants too. The two adults who entered the store with the thief appear to be covering him from view so other customers don't catch wind of his dastardly dog stealing.

Staff member Eddie Rosario says the man came into the store with what looked like his family.

Rosario says he asked the 'family' if they had any questions and they said no, they were just looking at dogs.

Disbelief: Staff member Eddie Rosario is shocked anyone would come into a pet shop with a small child to steal puppies

Another surveillance camera outside the store caught footage of the man's car, which was reportedly a darker colored Crown Victoria with some damage to the front end.

Staff at the store say the man used the child to distract them while he made off with the puppies.

'They used a kid to steal a dog,' Rosario said.

'I mean, you come here to steal a dog with a kid, that’s insane.'

The store's owner, Charles Glass, is offering a $250 reward to anyone who has information about who the thief is.
