Paul Lambert has spoken to Roy Keane over the phone and remains firm friends with his former assistant at Aston Villa.

Keane reportedly turned up at Tom Cleverley’s house to confront the midfielder over claims a bust-up with players led to his departure from the club.

But Lambert has also spoken to Cleverley, ineligible for Saturday’s match against Manchester United, and been told the incident did not happen the way it has been reported.

The Villa manager, who has repeatedly stressed as nonsense speculation that a row preceded Keane leaving, had a conversation with Keane on Wednesday night, and a brief word with Cleverley on Thursday morning.

Lambert said: 'I think if Roy took a strand from his beard it would be a story. Roy’s a good pal of mine and there’s no problem.

'I spoke to Tom for probably three seconds. He assured me that things hadn’t happened in the way they have been portrayed.

'Tom assured me there’s no problem. He’s perfectly relaxed about it. It’s finished.'
