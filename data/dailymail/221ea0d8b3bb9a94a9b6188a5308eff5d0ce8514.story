Cristiano Ronaldo became the joint third highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history on Sunday night with his 290th goal for the club in a 2-0 win over Elche.

The victory put Real four points clear of Barcelona who slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga and it also moved Ronaldo up another notch on Madrid’s all-time goals list.

Across almost two decades Spain international striker Santillana scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971. It has taken Ronaldo just 281 games to match that total and he is now only 17 goals from second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader Raul.

Host commentator

Real Madrid have capitalised on Barcelona's slip up by picking up all three points against Elche. The scoreline should have been a lot more but Real were wasteful in attack and Benzema had an emphatic acrobatic effort unfairly ruled out for offside. Ancelotti will be happy with the result as Real picked up the three points without having to step out of second gear. 

Isco receives a standing ovation after impressing for Real. He was the best player on the pitch for the 89 minutes he was on the field of play. We're into the final minute.

Ronaldo has a valid reason to be happy as he is now Real Madrid's third highest goalscorer with 290 goals. Alfredo Di Stefano (305) and Raul (323) are ahead of the former Manchester United ace.

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: So just when we thought Ronaldo might go four league games without scoring in the league for the first time in his Real Madrid career... he scores his 29th of the season in La Liga.

Ronaldo gets his goal with an outstanding header past the diving Tyton. The Portuguese star shows off his incredible aerial ability to direct his headed effort into the top corner. 

After scoring against Elche, Benzema has now scored against every current La Liga side - other than Real Madrid. 

The officials couldn't find a reason to rule this effort out! Benzema has the easy task of tapping the ball into an empty net after Elche fail to clear their lines. Real Madrid deserve their lead despite not being at their best. 

Niguez should have seen red for a horrendous challenge on Bale. His challenge was both late and high but the Spanish official decided to show the Elche midfielder a yellow card. 

Casillas pulls off a tremendous diving save to his right to deny Niguez. Replays show the Elche man's shot was going wide but the veteran goalkeeper wasn't to know. 

Casillas, who is making his 500th La Liga appearance today, had nothing of note to do during the first half. It may just have been the easiest 45 minutes of his Real Madrid career. Elche will surely try to test Real's defence during the second half. 

Sportsmail's Pete Jenson: Elche very fortunate still to be in the game. Ronaldo's missed a hat-trick's worth of goals and Benzema's should have stood. While it's 0-0 there's hope for Elche mainly because of Jonathas. You could see him against Pepe on at the Grand Garden Arena and people would watch it. Pepe just shading it at the moment.

Real Madrid have done everything but score. In fact, they did score but the officials decided to chalk it off. The away side will be confident they can win this game in the second half. One goal should be enough for Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the three points as Elche have failed to test Casillas. 

Benzema's has just had an outstanding effort unfairly ruled out for offside. The Frenchman put the ball in the back of the net by executing a bicycle kick however the officials chalked it off. Poor officiating. 

BBC (Bale, Benzema and Cristiano) have failed to really test Tyton as of yet. The trio have shown their quality in small periods of the first 38 minutes of this match but have not really linked up to really drive at Elche's defence.

Varane has just shown his strength by using his upper body to muscle Jonathas off the ball. The Elche forward committed a foul after trying to give the Real centre back a taste of his own medicine.

It might not be Ronaldo's day today. The Real Madrid has just sent a header over the bar from close range. He leaped above Elche's defenders but was unable to direct his effort at goal. Still 0-0 after 27 minutes. 

Real Madrid's final pass has been poor thus far. Marcelo just had the time and space to pick out one of his team-mates, however he over-hit his cross. 

How are Real Madrid not winning this game? Bale just played a delightful cross to Ronaldo at the back post but the Portuguese star surprisingly fluffed his lines. Remains 0-0 with 20 minutes on the clock. 

Real Madrid have just tried to walk the ball into the net. Ronaldo and Benzema tried to play a neat one-two in the area but the latter should have at least tested Tyton.  

Tyton, who has impressed for Elche since joining on a season-long loan move from PSV, has just denied Ronaldo with a diving save to his left. 16 minutes gone and Real have failed to unlock the home side as of yet. 

Elche are treading a fine line as they are giving Ronaldo the time and space to get shots off at goal. Bale almost put his side in the lead however the Welshman was denied by Elche goalkeeper Tyton.

Ronaldo, who is being booed by the home crowd, has just gone close to opening the scoring after just four minutes. The Portuguese captain was incredibly unlucky not to put his side in the lead. 

Real Madrid are dictating play already. Bale just put the ball in the back of the net but he was ruled offside by the Spanish officials. 

Real Madrid ran out 5-1 winners against Elche back in September with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring four goals against the La Liga minnows. Gareth Bale also managed to get on the scoresheet during the emphatic home win.

Carlo Ancelotti will be hoping his side can do the business on his 100th game in charge of the European champions. 

Iker Casillas is making his 500th appearance for Real Madrid tonight. The Spaniard has conceded 510 league goals during his time at the club.

Karim Benzema took to Twitter earlier today to congratulate his team-mate on his achievement.
