Waitress CeCe Bruce started her breakfast shift at the Steak 'n Shake with a bigger smile than usual after a customer left her a tip for nearly $500 tip for a $5 order.

The waitress, who fits in her full-time job at the Indianapolis diner alongside her studies, was shocked and delighted by the customer's generosity.

'It makes you look at life a little more positively,' Ms Bruce said.

The waitress, who has worked at the Steak 'n Shake in north Indianapolis for two years, told WishTV: 'All the worries that I have are kind of like out the door for the day, you know.'

The generous customer known as Miss Jo, who regularly enjoys a breakfast on Wednesdays at the diner, had watched while Ms Bruce waited on her table, as well as a table of four.

When it came to paying the $5.97 bill, the woman added nearly $500 to the tip.

Ms Bruce at first thought there had been made a mistake, and told her customer: 'No, no. That's too much. I can't take that.'

'I couldn't believe it,' she told the WTHR news channel. 'Miss Jo is such a nice person. It's just incredible.'

Greer Gooley, the restaurant's general manager, was not surprised that Ms Bruce's efforts were recognised, saying: 'She stays late, comes in early. Whenever we need her, she's here. So she deserves it more than anyone.'

The manager added: 'It just lets servers know that you work hard and it does pay off. There are people out there that [if] you do your job people reward you for it.'
