Baby girls from well-off districts can expect to enjoy good health for nearly 20 years longer than those in the poorest towns and suburbs, according to an official analysis.

It found that a newborn girl in one of the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas will live 71.3 years before her life is limited by chronic illness or disability.

But a girl born in one of the bottom 10 per cent of the most deprived areas can expect only 52.4 years of life in good health.

Lottery: Babies born living in the top 10 per cent of wealthy areas can expect to live up to 20 years longer without disability or chronic illness, than those in poorer areas. Baby girls in wealthy areas can expect to live healthy lives the longest

The difference means the well-off girl is likely to have a healthy life more than a third longer than that of a girl from a poor district.

The figures for boys are highly similar, according to the findings charted by the Office for National Statistics.

They provoked protests from poverty pressure groups, which compared health inequality in Britain with health levels in Third World countries, and complained that the wealth gap is now dragging down the health of the entire British population.

World Health Organisation figures on healthy life expectancy appear to show that men and women in Rwanda can expect to live healthily to 55 and 56 respectively. 

The same figures, from the Global Health Observatory Data Repository, show men and women in Romania will enjoy good health to 63 and 69, while those in Russia can expect to live to 57 and 66 without serious health issues.

Poor health: Baby boys born in the most deprived areas of Britain have the worst prospects having just 52.2 years of healthy living

The ONS findings for the UK say that healthy life expectancy is at its worst in the very poorest areas of the country – usually those with high levels of worklessness, benefit dependency and alcohol, tobacco and drug consumption – and that for four fifths of the population the health gap between the best off and the rest is much less marked.

The figures were calculated from the ONS Annual Population Survey which checks on the lives of 320,000 people a year.

For men, it said that boys born in the most deprived suburbs can expect 52.2 years of good health, compared to 70.5 years for those born in the best-off areas.

It said that if the figures were adjusted by measures designed to take into account income across the population rather than just in extremely poor or rich districts, the gaps were wider – 19.5 years for women as opposed to 18.9, and 19.1 years for men as opposed to 18.3.

The ONS figures showed that, above the poorest fifth of areas, newborn girls can all expect almost 60 years of healthy life or more, and boys more than 58 years.

Alison Garnham, chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: ‘The statistics lay bare what poverty and deprivation does to children here in the UK – it damages their health and shortens lives. Politicians of all parties need to act.’

Comparisons with Third World countries were made by the Equality Trust campaign group. Its director Duncan Exley said: ‘The UK is one of the most unequal countries in the developed world. This is damaging our health, our social bonds and our economy.’

The ONS figures are based on an analysis of nearly 33,000 neighbourhoods across England, but no individual district is named.
