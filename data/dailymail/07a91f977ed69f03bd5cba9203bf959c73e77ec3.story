She is not a woman to mince her words regardless of the subject.

So when confronted by sexist men who wanted to know why she didn’t have children, Helen Mirren was typically forthright – even managing to turn the air blue in doing so.

The Oscar-winning actress said it has never been women who have questioned her childless existence, but ‘only boring old men. And whenever they went, "What? No children? Well, you’d better get on with it, old girl", I’d say, "No! F*** off"!’

Miss Mirren, 67, the second of three children, has often spoken about her lack of maternal instinct.

In the past she has said she tried to talk herself into having children but does not regret her decision not to.

In a new interview for British Vogue, Miss Mirren touched on the subject once more, confessing: ‘It was not my destiny. I kept thinking it would be, waiting for it to happen, but I never did, and I didn’t care what people thought.’

Her magnificent portrayal of Elizabeth II in the 2007 film The Queen earned Miss Mirren an Academy Award for best actress and global fame.

Miss Mirren, who is married to director Taylor Hackford, is set to reprise her role as The Queen in play The Audience, which will open later this year.

But she admits she was worried about being typecast when she accepted the role the second time around.

She said: ‘Of course I wasn’t going to turn it down, it’s a lovely role to inhabit. But at the same time, I wasn’t sure I wanted to go back there.

'It was hard enough wriggling out of being Jane Tennison. I do sometimes think, if I die in a plane crash tomorrow, will people always think of me as The Actress Most Famous for Playing the Queen?'

Earlier this year Miss Mirren revealed her no-nonsense approach even extended to romance.

She married her husband in 1997 after 11 years together and said they don’t send each other Valentine’s cards, and they regularly forget to mark birthdays with a present.

She said: ‘Taylor and I aren’t remotely romantic with each other. And actually we appreciate the lack of romance in the other person.

‘I’d be completely horrified if Taylor gave me a Valentine’s card. That’s not our sort of relationship at all - we would pour cold water on that sort of thing.

‘We even forget to get each other birthday presents - I’m always thinking the day before, “Oh, I must get Taylor something for his birthday”.'
