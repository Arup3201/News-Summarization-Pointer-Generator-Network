Theirs is more than just your average boy-meets-girl story.

It's a New York love story, with a very modern twist.

Allen Sheinman, 58, and his wife Collette Stallone, 56, said they know the secret to a happy and successful marriage - live in separate homes.

For the first four years of wedded bliss the quirky couple - who met online - lived apart, she in Greenwich Village and he in West 23rd street in Manhattan.

Secret: Collette Stallone said she believes marriage is a state of mind and doesn't see why two people have to live together

Force: Allen Sheinman said he didn't want to both get married and lived together but the recession drove them to cohabit

Allen - a managing editor at a trade publication - said: 'We consider seventh avenue a long hallway between our two domiciles.'

But hard times hit as it did with many New Yorkers and when Allen's boss raised his rent to $1,800 a month, the couple did the unthinkable - they moved in together.

Allen said: 'It was really a financial move to cohabit. Now we are transitioning into real-time marriage. This is it.'

Speaking about living together - or not living together - Allen said it was an arrangement they were both comfortable with.

He said: 'I told her I could handle getting married and living together, just not both. And to my relief she said, "OK let's get married and keep our own places". That's what I was hoping for.'

Colette said: 'When you're young you think, "Oh, 
we’re in love," all that. But when you get older, you say, "You know, I 
love you, but I need my space".'

Expensive: Allen leaves his spacious apartment on West 23rd street because the rent was increased to $1,800

Tight squeeze: There is barely room for Collette's stuff in her Greenwich Village apartment nevermind her husbands

When Allen moved into Colette's tiny one-bedroom Greenwich Village apartment, where she has been for 31 years, even then they weren't prepared to fully live together.

Instead of embracing cohabitation, the couple drew up battle lines, put up invisible walls and lay down a set of ground rules.

According to the New York Post, there was no crossing into each other's space without permission, she had her own bedroom - where she generously said he could sleep at weekends - and he slept in a sofa bed in the living room.

The end?: The couple are still blissfully in love after four years of marriage and living apart but will cohabiting change that?

They have their own newspaper and magazine subscriptions,' watch their own TV shows from their own space and even have a shower rota.

The kitchen - which also hosts the apartment's only shower - is the only place that is allowed for both couples any time of the day or night.

Colette - a retired high-school teacher who now runs her home-made jewellery business - believes that not living together was the secret to their happy marriage.

'Getting married is a state of mind, I don't see why we have to live together. I don't need to see him brush his teeth,' she told the Post. 'It's bad enough I see him brush his hair.

'I don’t know where this idea came from that you always have to be in the middle of whatever the other person is doing.'

Alarmingly, she said when she told her ex-husband they were now living together he said: 'I give it four months.'

The couple are featured in a documentary titled 'Two's a crowd' which will have its New York premiere at the Rooftop Films Summer Series on July 21.
