NSW Police media confirmed that the deaths are being treated as suspicious and urged members of the public to come forward with any information. 

'This crime has occurred in your community and we are sure that people have knowledge of what happened and why,' said Superintendent Paul Condon of Deniliquin Local Area Command. 

The Mayor of the town, Thomas Weyrich told Daily Mail Australia that he is greatly concerned about the safety of the residents in Moama.

He also confirmed that rumours are rampant that the deaths were drug-related. 

'My greatest concern is that we have somebody walking around who is armed and is capable of multiple homicides,' said Mr Weyrich.

'I am extremely concerned, the people of Moama need to be very, very careful who they talk to and communicate with.

Mr Weyrich told Daily Mail Australia that rumours are flying around town speculating as to why the shootings took place, as people desperately search for answers. 

'There is speculation that the killings might be drug-related. But the town is awash with rumours,' said Mr Weyrich.

'I don't think anybody knows. I don't know anything more than the public.'

'Police are heavily involved and treating the case with the greatest urgency. The sooner the perpetrator or perpetrators are brought into custody the better.'

Councillor Weyrich said that he and the community are shocked, as nothing like this has ever happened before.

'We are a quiet little New South Wales town. This is a very safe place and we don't by and large have any criminal activity.

'This has come out of left field.'

The mayor did confirm that there is a bikie presence in the town.

'We do have a Bandidos clubhouse across the river and a member that lives close by, but I am not saying that they are involved.'

Resident Kylie Spencer said she was driving into town about 9.20am on Wednesday and noticed a white car pulled off the road.

'I didn't know there were bodies,' Ms Spencer, who lives on the road, told AAP.

'I drove past thinking they had a punctured tyre. You do 100km/h down that road.

'It was just pulled over on the road, nothing suspicious at all.'

Ms Spencer said there was another car pulled over next to the white vehicle.

She assumed the motorist was helping out. 

Emergency services, including police and paramedics, were called to the scene at Old Deniliquin Road on Tuesday morning.

'At 9.26am paramedics were initially called out to what we were told was a car accident,' a Victoria Rural Ambulance Service spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia.

'When the paramedics arrived they confirmed two people were deceased. 

'Police have now established a crime scene.'  

The town is in the Riverina region, 220 kilometres north of Melbourne and west of Albury.
