Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud believes he is playing some of the best football of his career and insists he is unfazed by any accusations of inconsistency.    

The Frenchman's brace against Newcastle on Saturday brought his seasonal tally to 17 goals in 26 appearances so far, as The Gunners remain on course to secure a top-four finish in the Premier League. 

Giroud told RMC Sport, 'Since I have been at Arsenal, this is perhaps my best period. I have to continue like that.'

He continued, 'I scored 16 or 17 goals in the league last year. I would like to do better.' 

In addition to his own personal targets, Giroud is determined to help Arsenal to a strong end to the campaign and has not ruled out a late push for the title. 

'Finishing second or third would be fine, although we will be hoping (league leaders) Chelsea slip up. Winning the FA Cup is also an objective. I continue my progress. I feel very well at Arsenal. It is important to continue to progress.' 

Giroud came under scrutiny recently after spurning two clear-cut chances in Arsenal's 3-1 defeat to Monaco in the Champions League, but the 28-year-old feels that he has answered his critics with his form since then.

'I did an interview last week before the match against Monaco. We had covered everything and the journalist said to me me: 'Giroud, this is not the same name as Sergio Aguero or Diego Costa'. I simply answered that a good striker lets his statistics speak.'    

He added, 'Obviously, it's was not at the good moment because I lacked efficiency in that game. I did a little teasing. But it's good to have shown mental strength to come back even stronger and prove that critics do not reach me.' 

Only Chelsea's Costa and Tottenham's Harry Kane have scored more than Giroud in the league this season and both have played over 500 minutes more game time.
