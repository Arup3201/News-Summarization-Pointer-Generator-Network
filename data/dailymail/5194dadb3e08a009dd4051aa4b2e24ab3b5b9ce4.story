A photographer braved temperatures of -45f (-42C) to visit a place that is literally located at the end of the earth to delight Arctic nomads by taking their photos for the first time and showing them the results   

Trudging through snow drifts and blizzards, across the deep tundra of the northern Russian region of Chukotka, Sasha Leahovcenco  travelled to meet a small nomadic tribe of reindeer herders - disconnected from the modern world where the way of life has barely changed for thousands of years.

Bringing along a digital printer to the region where it the record high is barely above 90f (32C), Leahovcenco photographed the men, women and children of the hardy native people there - and then to their delight showed them pictures of themselves for the first time in their lives.
