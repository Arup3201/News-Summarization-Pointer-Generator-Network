The Australian Grand Prix was nothing short of disastrous for McLaren, despite the fact the team spirit was clearly high before the first race of the season.

Pictures of preparations behind the scenes in Melbourne show  replacement driver Kevin Magnussen playing a clever practical joke on his team-mate, Jenson Button.

As Button stood on the scales to take his weight ahead of the Formula One curtain-raiser, Magnussen sneakily put his foot on the scale to add an extra few pounds on to Button's weight.

But the images show that Magnussen was caught in the act, as Button turned around to see his team-mate's foot hanging in the air. 

Magnussen was standing in for Fernando Alonso in the first race of the Formula One season, after Alonso was ruled out of the opener with concussion sustained in a crash in pre-season.

The 22-year-old Magnussen was left frustrated by his car at the race, though, as he suffered engine failure on the formation lap.

And Button did not have too much more luck. He was the only man to finish the race and not take a point in 11th.

McLaren will be hoping for better fortune providing Alonso returns as planned from his concussion for the Malaysian Grand Prix on March 29.
