The Australian businessman who allegedly masterminded an international paedophile ring has labelled himself 'bigger than Ben-Hur', maintaining that he isn't worried about what people think of him.

Peter Gerard Scully, 51, was arrested in the Philippines in February on charges of sexually abusing 11 children, the youngest of whom was only 18 months old, and killing another young girl, but says he isn't concerned about being sentenced to life in prison.

'I get bigger than Ben-Hur and people get interested. There is nothing I can do about it, so why worry about it?' Scully said.

Peter Gerard Scully alleged operated an  international paedophile ring that served Australian clients, according to AFP investigators.

'If I get sentenced, I get sentenced. That is something out of my control,' he told The Sydney Morning Herald. 

Scully has been accused of sexually abusing two girls, aged 10, and 11, and forcing them to dig their own graves while they were held captive in his house.

While the former businessman admitted they stayed in his house, he would not confirm the abuse.

'Accusations are [a] lot stronger than what really happened. That is something to talk about in the court which is the proper forum. There's nothing I can do to change what they [the girls] said,' Scully said.

Videos seized in the Philippines last week allegedly show one of Scully's victims, a 13-year-old girl, being forced to perform lewd acts with a baby aged one and girl toddler aged five, leading to renewed calls to reintroduce the death penalty. 

The videos, including one called 'The Destruction of Daisy' shows whipping and torture along with other horrific acts, and was described by police as the most shocking child pornography that has ever been discovered in the Philippines.

'You are looking at recruitment of children to then be abused, to perform sexual acts for offenders that are scattered all over the world. It is horrific,' said Margaret Akullo from the UN Office on Drugs and Crime. 

As a result of the horrific nature of his alleged crimes, the 51-year-old said he had been threatened by prisoners in the jail in southern city of Cagayan de Oro.

Scully said that he was trying to avoid confrontation in order to not be harmed by any of the 300 prisoners in the jail, but that they were actively trying to scare him.

Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme

Scully, who fled to Manila from Melbourne in 2011 after being accused of 117 fraud and deception offences, allegedly established a lucrative business live-streaming videos in a 'pay for view' scheme. 

Police alleged Scully would undertake acts in response to requests from his clients from across the globe, who paid to live-stream videos of children being tortured and sexually abused.

The former businessman claimed his internet marketing business was the reason for his move from Melbourne to the Philippines in 2011 as a result of lower wage costs.

Scully is a father of two children, now both adults, and claims to have been married to the same Chinese woman three times before divorcing. 

He was arrested on February 20 after the body of a teenage girl was found buried under a house he rented in Malaybalay, Bukidnon, and he was formally charged on Friday.

It is claimed he abused more than a dozen children in the three years he was in the Philippines, during which time he moved house frequently and assembled a team of more than four foreign accomplices and half a dozen Filipino workers for his 'pay for view' online child pornography business. 

Scully allegedly scammed more than $2.68 million from 20 investors in an investment scheme and was under investigation from 2009 by the Australian Securities and Investment Commission.

He returned to Australia  accompanied by a  Malaysian teenager named Ling in 2011, who was believed to be his 'girlfriend' before he turned her into a prostitute, associates claim.   

The death penalty was suspended in the Philippines in 2006, but an influential conservative politician told The Sydney Morning Herald that the Australian's alleged crimes were so depraved he should be put to death.

'The Philippine government should directly and seriously address the problem of paedophilia, child exploitation and sexual abuse by supporting the move to reimpose the death penalty,' Nationalist People's Coalition MP Sherwin Gatchalian said.  

An extremely graphic and distressing account by two young girls, who survived the trauma of Scully's alleged torturous abuse, paints a horrifying picture of what at least a dozen children are alleged to have endured in his home. 

Cousins, going by the name of Daisy,11, and and Queenie, 10, told rappler news site about the fateful day in September 2014 when they were approached by Scully's live-in partner, Carme Ann 'Angel' Alvarez. 

Alvarez, who was only 17 at the time and an alleged former victim of Scully's, offered the girls food at Centrio Mall in Cagayan de Oro City and then invited them back to their house.

Daisy said when they got to the house, Alvarez bathed the girls while Scully, who she referred to as the 'American', videoed them.   

The next morning the girls were asked to start digging a hole in the ground but had no idea why they had been asked to do the unusual task.

It was then after lunch that things became even more disturbing when allegedly Scully undressed the girls and told them to kiss each other.
