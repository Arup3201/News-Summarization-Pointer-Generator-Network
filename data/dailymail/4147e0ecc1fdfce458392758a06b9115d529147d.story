Any TV fan worth their salt will be familiar with EastEnders' character Zoe Slater's dramatic wail: 'You ain't my mother!'

And now the iconic 2001 scene where feisty character Kat Slater revealed that she was, in fact, Zoe's mother, has been named the greatest soap storyline of all time.

In a poll of 2,000 soap fans, the scene - in which Kat's confession that Zoe was conceived after Kat was abused by her uncle Harry - topped the list of favourite tears, tantrums and cliffhangers.

The Eastenders' storyline revealing Kat Slater to be the mother of her 'younger sister' Zoe has been named the greatest British soap narrative of all time

The iconic scene sees Zoe shout: 'You ain't my mother!' in the street before Kat screeches back: 'Yes I am!'

The famous street row between the pair, where Zoe yells 'You ain't my mother' at Kat before finding out the truth even featured in Australian soap Neighbours' recent tribute video to celebrate EastEnders' 30th anniversary.

Richard Hillman driving the Platt family into the canal in Coronation Street came second in the poll, followed by Hayley Cropper's courageous cancer battle and subsequent death in 2014.

EastEnders bad guy Dirty Den getting shot in 1989 and the Coronation Street tram crash completed the top five.

The episode was given the top spot in a poll of 2,000 soap fans on their favourite storylines

As well as old favourites, the recent Eastenders cliffhanger of 'who killed Lucy Beale' also made it in to the top ten, taking the number seven slot.

A spokesman for survey site OnePoll.com, which commissioned the research, said that the winning storyline thoroughly deserved its title.

'The Kat and Zoe storyline is something most people are familiar with, even if they aren't an avid EastEnders fan.

The tear-jerking episode of Coronation Street where Hayley Cropper died earned third place on the list 

The recent EastEnders storyline 'Who Killed Lucy Beale' earned seventh place on the list after attracting millions of viewers in a week of live episodes to celebrate the soap's 30th anniversary 

'It had everything a great soap storyline needs - a blazing row, some tears and a huge shock just as the episode comes to a close.'

He added that the reason that some of the older story lines had found their way into the top 50 was because they had a large impact on our lives.

'There have been many brilliant and gripping storylines over the years - whether they are tearjerkers like the moment Hayley died in Coronation Street or high drama like the live tram crash.

'Soaps are a huge part of our culture and these results show the storylines are remembered years after they are first screened.'

In second place was Richard Hillman driving The Platts into a canal in a 2003 episode of Coronation Street 

Sixth place in the poll went to the famous moment Dirty Den handed wife Angie divorce papers in the EastEnders' 1986 Christmas Day episode, followed by the London-based soap's huge 'Who Killed Lucy' story.

After almost a year's worth of teases, the killer was finally revealed to be her half-brother Bobby during a week of live episodes during the EastEnders 30th anniversary celebration.

Little Mo's domestic abuse storyline in EastEnders came eighth followed by Scott and Charlene's wedding in Neighbours and Deirdre Barlow being jailed for fraud in Coronation Street.

Little Mo's domestic abuse story also stuck in viewers heads as the 2001 drama came eighth in the poll

Other storylines to feature in the top 20 include the whodunnit storyline 'Who Shot Phil' in EastEnders, after the hard-man was shot on his doorstep, Corrie's Tyrone suffering domestic abuse at the hands of partner Kirsty and Mike Baldwin dying in rival Ken Barlow's arms on the cobbles.

The Emmerdale plane crash in 1993, the body under the patio in Brookside, Max and Stacey's affair in EastEnders and the famous love triangle between brothers Phil and Grant Mitchell and Grant's wife Sharon are also high on the list.

More than half of the storylines featured in the poll were ones from EastEnders, including the long-running storyline of 'Who Shot Phil Mitchell' that was on our screens over 2000-2001 coming 11th in the poll

EastEnders features heavily in the top 50 with more than half the list made up of storylines from the soap.

Old favourites such as Michelle Fowler falling pregnant with Dirty Den's baby as a teenager and Nick Cotton trying to kill mum Dot all feature alongside more recent storylines such as Dean Watt's attack on Linda.

Brookside, which was last on our screens in 2003, also features several times with Nat and Georgia's incest and Beth and Margaret's lesbian kiss, which was seen as a ground-breaking storyline at the time it was aired.
