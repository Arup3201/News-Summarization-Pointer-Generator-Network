A rock fan has been jailed for blasting out Pink Floyd hits in the middle of the night.

Paul Foster, 51, was locked up for 28 days after breaching an injunction preventing him from playing loud music for the fifth time.

Neighbours said Foster, of Chesterton, Staffordshire, would often play songs from albums such as The Dark Side Of The Moon, The Wall and Wish You Were Here.

Stoke-on-Trent County Court heard how 
one family even moved out of the area because they couldn’t put up with 
the loud music - which also included late night love ballads.

Paul Foster, 51, has been jailed for blasting out tunes from Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side Of The Moon' and 'The Wall'

On Tuesday Foster, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, was jailed for breaching an injunction from playing loud music for the fifth time.

Speaking after the hearing, Caroline Baggaley, Head of Aspire - the housing association that managed the property where Foster lived, said: 'We are pleased with the sentencing, as we do not tolerate antisocial behaviour - in particular noise nuisance.

'The vast majority of our customers have a quiet enjoyment of their homes and neighbourhoods and Aspire wants to ensure that everyone maintains this standard of conduct.'

Brother, brother: Foster also enjoyed tunes by soul supremo Marvin Gaye, as well as Barry White

One neighbour, who did not wish to be 
named, said after the case: 'Its been a nightmare. I like Pink Floyd as 
much as the next man but not when it’s being played ten times a day 
until 4am.

'He also seemed to like his late night 
love ballads - I’ve lost track of the times I’ve heard Barry White and 
Marvin Gaye coming from the house.

'But it was mainly Pink Floyd, and I think whenever I hear their songs again I’ll be climbing the walls. 'We just hope this teaches him a lessons and we can get a good night's sleep from now on.'

Another neighbour, added: 'It’s been going on for years. He has probably lived here for about 20 years.

'The people who used to live next door to him moved out because they couldn’t stand the noise any more. It can go on all night.

'Most of the time he keeps himself to himself.'

Foster was first hauled before the courts in September last year but then breached an ‘undertaking to his future conduct’ agreement on October 4 and December 1 last year.

He was sentenced to 21 days in jail suspended for one year on January 17 and also served with an injunction banning him from causing nuisance noise.

He breached the injunction on February 22 and was jailed for 63 days on March 20 when he admitted further breaches.

Foster then breached the injunction again on May 30 despite spending time at at HMP Dovegate prison, in Staffordshire.
