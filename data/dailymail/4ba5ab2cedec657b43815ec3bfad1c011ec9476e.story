Carly Rousso, 19, from Highland Park, Illinois, also faces an aggravated DUI charge for the crash in 2012 which killed Jaclyn Santos-Sacramento and injured her mother and two baby brothers.

Rousso is accused of 'huffing' computer dust cleaner in a Walgreens parking lot to get high before getting into her family's car and losing consciousness.

Support: Carly Rousso enters the Illinois courtroom on Tuesday with her parents holding her hands

Graphic surveillance video shows Rousso rolling up on a curb and running over the young family several times. 911 calls were also heard as part of testimony.

According to NBC, the child's mother testified on Tuesday. She said: 'She ran over my daughter's legs, then came forward, and went over her again.'

Rousso sobbed when a prosecutor placed a picture of the little girl in front of the courtroom.

During a taped video statement from her hospital bed with police in 2012, Rousso said that she made the 'impulse decision' to buy a canned cleaner that day and huffed three times before the crash.

Inhaling volatile substances because of their intoxicating effect is called huffing.

She said that she was 'depressed' and 'under a lot of pressure'.

Rousso reportedly had spent time in rehab for suicide, drugs and alcohol but told police that it was the first time she had 'huffed'.

The teen's attorney has argued that the chemical found in computer cleaner isn't illegal in Illinois.

Prosecutors say the chemicalÂ Difluoroethane was found in Rousso's blood shortly after the crash.

Rousso has been free on $500,000 bond.

The trial will conclude in a Lake County courtroom on Thursday.

In a videotaped police statement from her hospital bed, Rousso told police that she 'huffed' because she was under pressure and suffered from depression
