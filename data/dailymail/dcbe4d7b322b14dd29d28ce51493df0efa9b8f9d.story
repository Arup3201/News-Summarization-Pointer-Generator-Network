Alan Pardew has backed Crystal Palace defender Scott Dann to carry on improving and challenge for a place in the England squad in the near future.

England boss Roy Hodgson opted for Phil Jagielka, Gary Cahill, Phil Jones and Chris Smalling as his four centre back for the upcoming internationals with Lithuania and Italy at the end of the month.

But Dann has been in impressive form for Palace in recent months as they moved away from relegation danger.

But Pardew says that Dann, 28, has his best years ahead of him and can carry on improving.

He said: ‘He is a good age and is coming into his prime age as a centre half and he has a lot of experience under his belt at this level.

‘He has not surprised me in terms of his character because he plays with an honesty in every game. He has been very impressive since I have been here and his confidence is high. He hit a pass out to a left winger at the weekend that Glenn Hoddle would have been proud of.

‘He has some good players in front of him and they have a lot more experience at that top level than he does.

‘I don’t think he should be disappointed he has not made this squad. He is playing well at the moment and it is there for all to see. What will be, will be, but his best years are still in front of him.’

For Pardew personally, he would love to see a Palace player called up to the England squad.

Wilfried Zaha was the last Palace player to be called up to the England squad back in 2012 and Pardew says his players must find their place in the Premier League first.

Harry Kane’s rapid assent into Hodgson’s squad is something that Pardew admires and hopes he can unearth someone of his quality.

He added: ‘There have not been too many Palace players in the England squad in recent years and it would be nice to get someone in that squad.

Sometimes when a team has just been promoted and you are in your second year, you have not got the foundations yet to be proven to show you are good enough at that level.

Harry Kane has won a place in the England squad and Pardew has been impressed with his quick progress

‘Our boys are fighting for their status and you need to gain that.

‘To be fair to Harry Kane he has done that in a very quick time at a top club, and that is difficult to do, so hats off to him.

‘Lets hope we can produce someone of his ilk as he is a real example to players up and down the country.’
