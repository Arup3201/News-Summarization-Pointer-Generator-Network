Prime Minister David Cameron will be jetting off to Portugal for his summer family holiday, a survey reveals.

While Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg will be snubbing the UK in favour of visiting family in Spain.

And Labour leader Ed Miliband will be taking time out in the French countryside.

The findings come as a study reveals two thirds of MPs are likely to ditch a staycation and fly abroad for a summer holiday.

The report, by ABTA - the regulatory body for British travel agents - showed that as many 72 per cent of Conservative MPs are planning on a trip overseas in the coming months.

While 63 per cent of Labour MPs are also set to swap the UK for more exotic climes during the break.

However, out of the three main parties, the Liberal Democrats are more inclined to take a staycation, with just 47 per cent saying they would travel further afield.

Out of the regions, politicians in Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Midlands are the most likely to take a foreign holiday, with 77 per cent intending to have a break abroad.

This contrasts with 74 per cent of London MPs, 64 per cent of MPs from northern England, and 50 per cent of Welsh MPs.

MPs in the south of England are the least likely to venture abroad this summer, with only 48 per cent planning a trip.

The survey also revealed that male MPs (67 per cent) are more likely to give in to their wanderlust than their female counterparts (60 per cent).

ABTA public affairs head Stephen D'Alfonso said: 'Our survey shows that for MPs, like many of their constituents, a holiday abroad is a key part of their summer plans.

'We ask them, as they enjoy their break, to think about the high level of air passenger duty they and their constituents will have paid on flights, and to push for the Government to scrap or reduce the tax for the benefit of the economy as well as local families.'

A total of 154 MPs took part in the survey.
