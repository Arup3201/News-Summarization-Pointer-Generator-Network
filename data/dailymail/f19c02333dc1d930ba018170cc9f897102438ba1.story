He may not look like your conventional hero. But when a huge traffic jam sent tempers fraying in the weekend heat, it was John Prescott to the rescue.

The former deputy prime minister surprised fellow motorists when he jumped from his car and stood in the middle of the road to direct the traffic.

Solemnly waving his hands left and right, Lord Prescott – nicknamed Two Jags while in office for having two Jaguars – made an unexpected sight for the drivers of Hull.

The Labour politician, 75, who last 
year lost out on the race to become Humberside’s police and crime 
commissioner, joked: ‘I may not be commissioner, but I can be a traffic 
cop!’

He had been attending Hull’s Veterans’ Weekend in a local park when he got caught in the jam while leaving a car park.

‘It was a mess,’ he said. ‘Kids were getting uptight in the back of cars and adults were getting angry.
‘So I thought, “There’s only one thing for it”. People were shouting at 
me, “Good on you, John!” Within half an hour or so the build-up was 
cleared.’

Lord Prescott, 75, allowed half a dozen vehicles at a time to pass through the park gates, before signalling for oncoming traffic to make their way along the road.

Honorary Alderman Brian Petch, organiser of the annual two-day event said: 'Every year he's there - he's like a big kid.

'He likes to have a go on all the rides and loves walking around taking everything in and chatting with people.'

It was the ninth year Hull's East Park 
had hosted Veterans' Weekend, which saw it transformed into a battle 
camp, complete with military-themed displays.

A collection of treats for soldiers currently deployed in Afghanistan was held.

Captain Dave Mitchell, chairman of the Council of Ex-Servicemen's Association, helped organise the collection.

He said: 'The amount donated was fantastic. I'll have enough items to fill 60 to 80 boxes for the lads and girls in Afghanistan'.

Lord Prescott said: 'Hull Veterans' Weekend is a superb tribute from Brian and Hull City Council to the veterans.

'My wife, Pauline, and I normally enjoy a jive, but she has a bad leg, so we just had a waltz instead.'
