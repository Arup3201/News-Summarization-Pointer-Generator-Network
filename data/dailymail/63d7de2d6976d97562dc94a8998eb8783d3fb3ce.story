IT must have taken all her willpower, all her strength.

Andy Murray’s mum cheered him on yesterday as he thrashed her favourite tennis pin-up Feliciano ‘Deliciano’ Lopez.

How Judy must have steeled herself for this moment. On one hand, a mother’s pride at her champion in the making; on the other, the end of a beautiful Twitter relationship with the hunkiest player on the circuit.

'My mum fancies you': Murray offers some words of consolation to his vanquished opponent

What enormous reserves of restraint 
she must have called upon not to blow Lopez a goodbye kiss or give him a
wolf-whistle. But after all their mock flirting over the internet, you 
might at least have expected the defeated Spaniard to send her an 
affectionate Tweet.

For 50-year-old divorcee Mrs Murray, whose public 
infatuation with Lopez threatened at one stage to take on Mills & 
Boon proportions, the dream must end. But 24-year-old Andy’s dream of 
winning Wimbledon might soon be on the way to fruition on the strength 
of his performance yesterday.

He and 29-year-old Lopez faced each 
other like gladiators on Centre Court as Mrs M looked down from a seat 
in the players’ box alongside her son’s girlfriend Kim Sears.

Murray had failed once again to shave
off his straggly facial hair. Steady now  Judy, but it seemed his hunky
opponent had recently waxed his chest.

Both players had both spent the 
morning practising in public. Andy had his family there; Lopez, who 
somehow managed to make pouring a bottle of water over his head look 
sexy – was watched by a cluster of 20-something females among the crowd.

They cooed and purred at every movement of the bronzed body Mrs Murray had described 24 hours earlier as ‘like a Roman god’.

We asked him if he would he blow a 
kiss towards Mrs Murray. ‘Do you really think this is the right time to 
ask these questions, man?’ he replied, clearly in no mood to join Judy’s
fun.

On Centre Court, however, the crowd 
quickly picked up on the tongue-in-cheek theme that Mrs M has kept alive
through schoolgirlish tweets about Lopez and racy remarks in 
interviews. ‘Come on Feliciano,’ an English accent shouted. ‘Do it for 
Judy!’ Mrs Murray smiled. Kim, not so much. Andy, not at all.

This is the third time in a row the 
Scot has qualified for the semi-finals. He plays Rafael Nadal tomorrow. 
Asked at his post-match press conference about the continuing 
flirtation between his mother and his vanquished opponent, Murray 
grimaced. ‘I haven’t spoken to her about it but I was embarrassed by 
it,’ he groaned.

For Lopez, it will have to be some other mañana. And – until next time at least – adios from Judy.

Also bidding a dejected farewell to 
Wimbledon was Roger Federer, who cruised to a two-set lead before 
Frenchman Jo-Wilfried Tsonga launched an astonishing comeback to win in 
five and earn a semi-final clash with Novak Djokovic.

This was the Swiss master’s  worst 
result here since he took over from Pete Sampras as the King  of Grass. 
The King is dead ... long live King Murray?

The British fourth seed was never threatened by the unseeded Spaniard Lopez who wilted under a relentless barrage of pinpoint groundstrokes and consistent serving.

Murray served three successive aces to seal victory on his first match point and he will next play top seed Rafa Nadal or American Mardy Fish as he continues his bid to become the first British men's singles champion at Wimbledon for 75 years.        

Murray took the match 6-3 6-4 6-4 with the comfort of three match points to seal victory in the final game.

Murray said: 'I thought it was good. I think Feliciano was a little bit tired but I served well for most of the match. I'm playing well. I'm sure in the next round I'm going to get pushed even harder so I'll have to raise my game even more.'

Seize the day: Andy Murray of Great Britain reacts to a play during his quarterfinal round match against Feliciano Lopez

The British No 1 had begun his previous match against Richard Gasquet rather slowly but he quickly showed he would not make the same mistake again, piling the pressure on Lopez.

The Spaniard is unseeded but a talented player on grass and making his third appearance in the quarter-finals. He had been hugely impressive in a straight-sets win over Andy Roddick in round three but few were predicting another upset here.

Murray looked totally focused and a superb passing shot brought up another break point in the third game of the second set but Lopez, who has served more aces in the tournament than anyone else, quickly shut the door.

The Spaniard was bound to be feeling the effects of a lengthy five-setter against Lukasz Kubot in round four, where he had fought back from two sets down, and his right thigh was heavily taped up.

Lopez's stated belief that he could beat Murray for the first time in five meetings had to be called into question by his decision not to pull out of his mixed doubles match on Monday, and he was simply not playing at anywhere near the Scot's pace.

A forehand volley dumped into the net gave the world number four a break for 3-2, and from there he was utterly untroubled, clinching the set 6-4 courtesy of yet another unforced error from Lopez.

Murray had lost only eight points on his serve in the first two sets, and never more than two in a single game, but there were just signs at the start of the third that things might be changing.

Lopez took the Scot to deuce for the first time in game three, finally stringing a series of good shots together, but his revival was quickly curtailed by another Murray break.

It needed the 24-year-old to be at his best, with a forehand winner down the line followed by a stunning pass on the run.

Murray was nearly there, and he held to make it 4-2 without too many problems, but he began to grimace and struggle a little with his movement.

The Scot did not call the trainer but in the eighth game he found himself facing his first break points of the match. Lopez, though, could not take advantage, and three successive aces helped Murray wrap up a simple victory.

Now, with Federer out of the running for the final, Murray fans can finally allow themselves a glimmer of hope that maybe this is the year Andy Murray could win Wimbledon.

With confidence behind Murray growing, ticket sales sites have reported that the price of tickets is soaring.

According to one seller, ardent Murray fans could be willing to pay up to £20,000 a ticket to watch him if he gets to the Wimbledon final.

Tickets for the men's final are trading for up £10,000 on one website.

Edward Parkinson, director of viagogo UK, said: 'Tickets to see Murray are really driving sales - every time he wins, ticket prices for the men's semi-finals and final jump by around 30 per cent as the nation's hopes are raised.

'Tickets for the men's final are currently trading at £10,000. If he keeps winning, I expect some seats will go for twice this level if not more.'

This time last year tickets were trading at £6,000 when Murray was still in the championships.

Among the crowd showing their support for Murray were a sea of familiar faces.

Pippa Middleton, wearing a red dress from high street store Hobbs' line NW3, watched with parents Carole and Michael and boyfriend Alex Loudon, from whom it was recently rumoured she had separated.

Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton greeted Andy Murray's mother Judy, who was at the centre of attention after admitting to having a crush on Murray's rival Feliciano.
