The High Speed 2 rail project has faced many challenges  in its ambitious attempt to link the North of England with London.

But transport chiefs have now picked a fight with a new foe – the hard-partying, celebrity Primrose Hill Set.

Hundreds of residents of the affluent North London neighbourhood, which has been home to supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law, are furious after being told their multi-million pound homes could be seized to make way for the scheme.

Hundreds of residents of the affluent North London neighbourhood Primrose Hill, which has been home to supermodel Kate Moss and actor Jude Law, are furious after being told their multi-million pound homes could be seized to make way for the scheme

They include shopping expert Mary Portas, the Government’s high street tsar, who has been warned that her £4.5million Georgian home could be subject to a compulsory purchase order.

Under the power, authorities have the legal right to buy the property at market value to allow major public projects to proceed.

She and other residents live near the route of a proposed tunnel, and as part of the work engineers need to replace a Victorian sewer underneath their homes. 

Those with basements converted into bedrooms, gyms, offices and wine cellars fear they could lose the space to make way for the work.

Homeowners fear the threat from the official letters alone could reduce their house prices.

Properties affected include an Italian restaurant popular with Labour leader Ed Miliband and a pub frequented by BBC presenter Andrew Marr and the mid-1990s ‘Primrose Hill Set’ including Ewan McGregor, Rhys Ifans and Sadie Frost.

A spokesman for HS2 said it was meeting its legal obligations by writing to residents. And while it has the permission to seize properties, the firm would only do so ‘if required’.

Some cellars may also extend beyond the property, added the spokesman.

Miss Portas declined to comment.

The letters were sent following the publication of a 50,000-page document detailing the environmental impact of phase one of the £50billion scheme, which is due to be put before both houses in April.

Prime Minister David Cameron has described HS2 as a ‘vital investment’ that will provide a high-speed link from Manchester and Leeds to London via Birmingham.

The latest letters were sent following the publication of a 50,000-page document detailing the environmental damage by the proposed London to Birmingham phase one of the railway construction.

It is part of a Parliamentary Standing Order before the hybrid bill to approve the £50billion scheme is due to be put before both houses in April.

A spokesman for the HS2 project said while it has the permission to compulsory purchase affected properties, it did not intend to do so at this stage.

He said: ‘The works involve replacing the old sewer that runs under Princess Road. The houses on this road have cellars, which might extend beyond the property.

‘In order to meet the legal requirements of the Parliamentary Standing Order, we are required to notify the property owners about the proposed works. HS2 Ltd does not intend to acquire or gain access to the cellars.

'However, the powers in the Bill would allow us to do so if required.’
