Secretary of State John Kerry asked Congress on Tuesday for new war powers in the fight against the Islamic State, but said lawmakers should not limit U.S. military action to Iraq and Syria or prevent President Barack Obama from deploying ground troops if he later deems them necessary.

'The president has been crystal clear that his policy is that U.S. military forces will not be deployed to conduct ground combat operations against ISIL,' Kerry told a Senate committee, using the administration's preferred name for the terrorist group.

'It doesn’t mean that we should pre-emptively bind the hands of the commander in chief or our commanders in the field in responding to scenarios and contingencies that are impossible to foresee,' he said.

Secretary of State John Kerry asked  the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday for a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force agreement that would give the Obama administration broader powers in its fight against ISIS

Obama has been unvarying in his statements on ground troops, stating on multiple occasions that he would not allow U.S. forces to become mired in another war in Iraq, even as his military advisers have admitted that a time may come when the president will have to put boots on the ground.

The White House said on Wednesday that there is actually one instance in which the president already did 'commit ground troops...in a combat role in Syria.' 

Over the summer Obama ordered a rescue mission of American hostages, and that included boots on the ground, the president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said.

If Congress were to ban 'the use of combat troops, the president's hands would be tied, and he wouldn't be able to order a mission like that' in the future, Earnest claimed.

'And that is what we're seeking to avoid,' he said. 

Further explaining the administration's request, Earnest said, 'It's impossible for us to imagine all of the contingencies that could occur.'

'The president's been very clear that he does not envision a scenario where he is going to commit substantial U.S. ground troops in a combat role in Iraq or in Syria,' he said. 

In the battle against the Islamic militants, Obama has been relying on congressional authorizations that former President George W. Bush used to justify military action after 9/11. 

The Commander in Chief has insisted that he had the legal authority to send about 3,000 U.S. troops to train and assist Iraqi security forces, and launch hundreds of airstrikes against targets in Iraq and Syria since September.

Critics say the White House's use of post-9/11 congressional authorizations is a legal stretch at best, however, and Kerry on Tuesday appeared before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to tell lawmakers what sort of war powers the administration would like to see lawmakers include in a new Authorization of Military Force Agreement. 

The White House is now backing the creation of a new AUMF limited to the current military campaign that would, as Earnest said today, 'move the US away from a permanent war.'

Sen. Robert Menendez, a Democrat and the the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, joined legislators from both sides of the aisle in lamenting that if the White House wants a new AUMF, it should have sent suggested language to Congress months ago.

Nevertheless, the New Jersey senator said that, 'Congress, rather than the executive, has the responsibility and the authority to authorize military action and to declare war,' and it should not accede that power to the president by doing nothing at all.

'We are the check and balance on executive power, regardless of who that executive is. And if we abandon that role, then we will have done a grave disservice to the American people,' he said.

Similarly, his Democratic colleague Tim Kaine of Virginia said Congress ought to pass new authorization immediately. 

Kaine said he doesn't want Congress to go home for the holidays while there are U.S. service men and women fighting overseas and risking their lives without putting their imprint on the conflict.

'We are at war,' Kaine said. 'Congress has been silent about this.'

CodePink protesters held up anti-war placards as Kerry testified before the committee. The Obama administration officials asked Congress on Tuesday to grant the president the authority to put boots on the ground in the fight against ISIS if necessary

Menendez said he would call for a committee vote on a new authorization later this week. 

Yet few expect that Congress will approve new war powers before the end of the lame-duck session this year. The legislature is scheduled to recess for the holidays on Friday and will not resume activities until the first full week in January, when Republicans will  take control both the Senate and the House.

'Whatever passes out of committee this week is not going to become law,' Republican Sen. Bob Corker, the incoming chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday, recognizing the time constraints. 

He said the committee also wants to hear from intelligence and defense officials before its makes a decision.

Kerry said the administration believes a proposal drafted by Menendez is a good starting point, but that the administration seeks some important changes.

Generally, Kerry said the administration is seeking an authorization that does not include a geographical limitation. 

'We don't anticipate conducting operations in countries other than Iraq and Syria, but to the extent that ISIL poses a threat to American interests and personnel in other countries, we would not want an AUMF to constrain our ability to use appropriate force against ISIL in those locations if necessary,' he said.

The secretary of state said 'it would be a mistake to advertise to' the Islamic State militants that they have safe haven outside those countries.

However, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a probable Republican presidential candidate, said he could not vote for any authorization that did not have geographic restrictions.

'That is a very scary and very wrong-headed message to be sending to the Middle East,' the libertarian lawmaker said. 'You are sending a message to the Middle East that no city is off limits.' 

Paul has proposed legislation of his own to the Senate that would formally declare war on ISIS and give the Obama administration the authority to put American troops in combat  in 'limited operations.'

The one-year resolution would terminate a 2002 AUMF the Obama administration has been deriving its authority to attack ISIS from and introduce a one-year sunset into the other. 

Kerry said Tuesday that the confrontation against ISIS will not be over quickly, however, and that while the administration does not seek an open-ended authorization, it wants it to include a provision that would allow for it to be extended.

Kerry debated back and forth with senators from both parties about the differences between what Congress is proposing for the AUMF and what the Obama Administration wants. Senators told Kerry that the administration should have come to Congress with its list of demands months ago

Menendez's resolution would limit operations to three years and allow ground forces in some circumstances. 

It also would compel Obama to provide Congress with a comprehensive strategy and repeal the Bush administration's 2002 Iraq war authorization. Kerry said the administration would agree that any new authorization would supersede the 2002 authorization.

Moreover, Kerry said the administration wants to make sure that any authorization does not  too narrowly define militants found alongside ISIS because it would, for example, make it difficult for the U.S. military officials on the ground to identify enemy forces.

Arizona Sen. John McCain, a strong critic of Obama's foreign policy in Iraq and Syria, called the hearing a 'kind of charade' because the authorization was not expected to become law before the new Congress starts in January. 

He said Obama needs to present a draft authorization to Congress in January.

'He should lead and tell us what that authorization should be,' McCain said.

McCain further criticized the Obama administration for not giving the Syrian opposition the military equipment and weapons it needs to fight against Syrian President Bashar Assad who is 'slaughtering' his people.
