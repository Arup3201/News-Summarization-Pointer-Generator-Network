Mothers and fathers have beaten famous entrepreneurs, naturalists and Olympians to be named the nation's greatest role models.

More Britons polled named their parents as their inspiration, than notable names including Sir Richard Branson, Nelson Mandela and Mo Farah.

According to a new study, the average Briton has 12 role models over a lifetime.

Almost half believe their success at home and in the workplace is down to the inspiring people in their life

While most teenagers look up to 
sports stars, 20 to 30-year-olds admire famous politicians and philanthropists,
 and those in their 30s want to follow in the footsteps of 
successful entrepreneurs. 

But from their teens through to their late 70s, more Britons cite their parents as inspiration than any other figure.

Respondents were asked to select as many figures as they wished from a list of more than 100 potential figures.

Those in their 30s were found to 
have the most, with up to five inspirational figures at any one time, 
while those in their 50s have the least, with one in five (23 per 
cent) claiming not to have a role model at all.

Despite this, nearly half of adults (47 per cent) believe their success at home and in the workplace is down to the inspiring people in their life, while 45 per cent said their role models had encouraged them to follow their dreams.

The famous faces Britons most look up to were entrepreneurs, naturalists, politicians, philanthropists and athletes.

Teenagers especially seek to 
follow in the footsteps of Britain's elite sportsmen and women, such as 
Mo Farah (38 per cent), David Beckham (24 per cent) and Jessica 
Ennis-Hill (21 per cent).

All three feature prominently in the teenage top ten, with nearly four in ten (38 per cent) of all Britons questioned citing Britain's Olympic heroes and top athletes among their list of role models.

Britons in their 20s are most enamored with world changers, with the humanitarian efforts of Nelson Mandela (39 per cent) and Martin Luther King's (34 per cent) ticking all the right boxes.

By comparison, those in their 30s and 40s take inspiration from business leaders, with charismatic entrepreneur Richard Branson proving very popular (45 per cent and 55 per cent respectively).

Those in 
their 50s and 60s meanwhile voted in favour of discovery and 
adventure, with world-famous naturalist David Attenborough topping both 
lists with 48 per cent and 59 per cent in the respective age groups.

Regardless of age, Britons acknowledge 
the positive benefit of having a role model with one in four (24 per 
cent) claiming they had either taken up a new sport or changed their 
career direction (25 per cent) as a result of their inspirational 
figures in their life.

The survey was commissioned by Disney Aim High to mark 
the TV premiere of the mentorship scheme's masterclass with Olympic gold
 medal cyclists Laura Trott and Jason Kenny on Disney Channel and Disney
 XD.

A
 spokesperson said: 'No matter how old we are, role models and mentors 
can have a huge and very positive impact on our everyday lives.

'With
 Disney Aim High we want to encourage kids to look for inspiration to 
help them set goals and reach for their dreams. Through Aim High 
mentorships with Britain's elite athletes and entertainers - such as 
Laura Trott and Jason Kenny, the first mentors of 2014 - hopefully we're
 able to inspire Britain's next generation of champions.'

Recent
 research commissioned by Disney also found that mentors are incredibly 
beneficial for children. The academic review revealed that kids who have
 an inspirational individual in their life are likely to be healthier 
and have increased earning power than those without.
