One woman is the subject of public hatred after being acquitted of her daughter's murder - and the other is just trying to promote a new book.

But L. Concetta Graves, of Orlando, Florida, is having a torrid time of late because she keeps being mistaken on the street for Casey Anthony.

Ms Graves looks similar to acquitted murder suspect Anthony, 25, and was even involved in attack by three men before scaring them away with a gun.

Mistaken: L. Concetta Graves, left, of Orlando, Florida, keeps being mistaken on the street for Casey Anthony, pictured right with her lawyer Jose Baez

She is an author and actually thought at first the extra attention she was receiving was from fans of a new book she published with her brother.

Anthony was released from jail last month after her acquittal on a murder charge connected to her two-year-old daughter Caylee's death in 2008.

Although their faces certainly look different, the comparisons have come when Ms Graves goes out wearing a baseball hat and sunglasses.

‘At the post office, some guy flung the door open real violently and fast and said: 'Oh my God, is that Casey Anthony?”’ Ms Graves told NBC.

But the worst moment for Ms Graves while she was walking with her brother, D.M. Blade, and three men jumped out of a truck.

Tuesday would have been the sixth birthday of Caylee Anthony.

There will be a memorial event near where her body was found in 2008, reported People magazine.

Balloons and butterflies will be released in memory of the toddler.

They shouted ‘baby killer’ at them, Mr Blade was pushed to the ground by one of the men and he suffered two black eyes in the attack.

‘I was scared to death,’ Ms Graves told NBC. ‘I don't know if they had guns. I didn't know what was going to happen, if someone was going to stab him.’

But because she had a gun she was able to scare them off.

Now friends are saying she should either stay at home or dye her hair.

She has decided to start wearing her hair down instead and ‘dressing a little differently’ to avoid any more unfortunate comparisons.
