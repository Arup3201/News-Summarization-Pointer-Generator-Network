Chilling surveillance footage allegedly shows suspected carjackers prowling a mall parking lot for targets just days before they shot dead a young lawyer in front of his wife.

Dustin Friedland, 30, was gunned down at The Mall in Short Hills, New Jersey on December 15  last year by the four suspects, who fled the scene in his expensive Range Rover.

His wife Jamie Schare Friedland, who witnessed the attack, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the mall earlier this year, claiming they had reduced security ahead of the tragedy to increase profits.

Now the footage, which was released to ABC News, apparently shows the suspects stalking other vehicles and fleeing the scene without any security staff intervening.

On the prowl: The carjackers' SUV drives around the almost-empty parking lot, apparently looking for targets

Stalking: The carjackers' car can be seen right while the white SUV drives ahead of them. They are apparently not stopped by any security guards in the footage and three days later carried out a deadly attack

One video shows the group's car creeping through the mall parking lot on December 12 - three days before the attack - to apparently test out the security measures, ABC reported.

It shows the suspects slowly circling parking lots before honing in on a white luxury SUV and following it out of the mall.

'They're confident that they can do their carjacking whenever and however they want,' retired NYPD detective Nick Casale told ABC. 'They're hunters and they're looking for their prey.'

Surveillance footage from December 15 shows the suspects driving up beside a parked SUV in one parking lot before leaving the area and heading over to the Friedlands' car.

After the shooting, as the victim and his wife waited for an ambulance, cameras captured the suspects fleeing in two cars - their SUV and Dustin Friedland's.

Loss: Dustin Friedland and his wife Jamie had just finished shopping when they were attacked in their car at the Mall on December 15 last year. Friedland, a lawyer, was targeted for his expensive car, police say

'The surveillance videos are chilling,' Bruce Nagel, Mrs Friedland's lawyer, told ABC. 'On December the 12th, the same car with apparently the same individuals was apparently casing the mall. They actually had a dry run.'

He called the footage taken on the night of the crime 'incredible'.  

'You see both the perpetrators' vehicle and my clients' vehicle, speeding out of the mall,' he said. 'There is nobody there. There is no policeman to stop them.'

He added that the surveillance footage  is 'a wakeup call' for the mall, which needs to reassure shoppers that they are safe. But he said it has not changed it ways since the tragedy last year.

Nagel obtained the mall's surveillance footage just days after a judge denied its request to keep it to themselves.

Taubman Centers, which owns the mall, had said prospective criminals could use the footage to determine the location of surveillance cameras. 

But state Superior Court Judge James Rothschild Jr. declined to grant the order, saying it was a 'fairly unlikely scenario'.

After the shooting, four men - Basim Henry, Hanif Thompson, Karif Ford and Kevin Roberts - were arrested and indicted on a list of charges, including murder and carjacking.

They remain in jail and have all pleaded not guilty. They each face the possibility of life in prison if convicted. 

Mall lawyer Christopher McIntyre declined to discuss the case or the security, citing the ongoing litigation.
