Socialist Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has said multi-millionaire footballers playing in France will not be exempt from the super tax

Multi-millionaire footballers playing in France will not be exempt from the country's 75 per cent super tax, Socialist Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault confirmed today.

The announcement will be a huge blow to clubs like Paris St Germain, who have signed up some of the richest players in the world, including former England captain David Beckham.

The former England captain lives in a 
Paris hotel and has left his family back in London, which technically 
means he may be able to avoid paying French taxes on his fortune, which 
is estimated at around £200million.

But Mr Ayrault has made it clear he
wants multi-millionaire sportsmen like Beckham to donate huge 
proportions of their wealth to his administration.

'All companies that pay wages above one million' will be affected by the proposed new tax, said Mr Ayrault.

It follows Noel Le Graet, president of the French Football Federation, claiming he had received 'assurances' that 'only big companies will be taxed' and that football clubs are considered 'small' companies.

In fact Paris St Germain is currently the richest club in the world, having been bought by sheiks from oil-rich Qatar. 

Its wage bill is enormous, although Beckham claims that he is virtually working for free, and intends to donate his salary to charity.

A government spokesman confirmed: 'The new measure will apply to all companies paying out salaries above 1 million euros.'

There has been huge opposition from France's rich to the tax, which President Francois Hollande first unveiled during his election campaign last year.

Rich businessmen and celebrities have been flooding out of Paris since Mr Hollande came to power. 

They include Hollywood star Gerard Depardieu who has obtained Russian nationality and put his home in the French capital on the market. 

Bernard Arnault, the LMVH boss who is France's richest man, has also applied for a Belgium passport.
