Norwich defender Sebastien Bassong is poised to join Watford on loan next week.

Bassong, 28, was captain under Chris Hughton but has fallen out of favour with manager Neil Adams.

Adams praised Bassong after he played a development match against Southampton on Monday.

Sebastien Bassong has made 141 Premier League appearances, but has fallen out of favour at Norwich

However, Adams will let Bassong go to Watford for three months.

The Cameroon international has made 141 Premier League appearances but dropped down to the Championship for the first time this season.

He has amassed 15 caps for his country.
