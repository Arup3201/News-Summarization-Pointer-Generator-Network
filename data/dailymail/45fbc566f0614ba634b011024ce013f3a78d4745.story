Fiona O'Loughlin has been bullied by Internet trolls who are ridiculing her for her history of alcoholism, after the comedienne criticised Adam Hills for posting grieving tweets after Joan Rivers' death. 

O’Loughlin reveals she was told to ‘drop dead’ and get ‘back on the booze train’ by trolls. 

Ms O'Loughlin blasted Adam on social media for 'boarding the grief train' two weeks ago, after Hills paid his respects, sending sad tweets to pay tribute to the late Joan Rivers. 

Hills' infamously called Joan Rivers a 'd***' and yelled 'f*** you!' during a heated monologue on his television show, The Last Leg, last year.

A still from the heated rant Adam Hills made last year on his television show, The Last Leg, in which he took the late Joan Rivers to task for being 'a d***' and a 'jaded, bitter old mole'

Joan Rivers passed away last week at the age of 81, after complications during a routine throat procedure. River's passing has been met with an outpouring of grief and emotion worldwide

Fellow Aussie stand-up comic O'Loughlin is now apologising to Hills for her comments.

She has also taken to the Internet to expose the relentless abuse she has received from online trolls since she made the comments.

On September 9, she first made mention of being bombarded by insulting comments.

'Why can't anyone troll me without mentioning my alcoholism? It's a disease you twats & I'm the first to admit I've got it.' 

Hills expressed his concern when it was announced that Joan Rivers was in an induced coma via this message on his Twitter account on August 28.

The Aussie comedian again used social media to publically share his opinion of Joan Rivers. Although, this time round, Hills approach was to celebrate her contribution to comedy

Fiona O'Loughlin took to Twitter to publically try and put Adam Hills in his place, after he posted two emotional tweets about the late Joan Rivers. Adam Hills gave a raging two-minute monologue directed at Joan Rivers during his show The Last Leg last year

In a Facebook post that has since been deleted, O'Loughlin allegedly acknowledged that during her battle with the bottle, Adam Hills' former tv show, Spicks and Specks, were supportive and tolerant.   

'I’m embarrassed to complain because the industry has been so kind and forgiving. 

'Ironically in particular by Adam Hills and the crew on more than one occasion by showing me nothing but concern and kindness having turned up drunk to the recording of the show,' according to news.com.au.

O'Loughlin then pays tribute to the late Joan Rivers, who passed away 10 days ago. 

'What I know is that Joan Rivers could have wiped the floor with me with stories of hardship.

'Her husband suicided and she had no choice but to get up on that stage.'

 Aussie comedienne Fiona O'Loughlin has taken to Twitter, criticising Adam Hills for 'jumping on the grief train', considering Hills so publically slammed Joan Rivers for her behaviour and attitude last year.

The former alcoholic has been honest about her struggles with the disease and has been sober since 2008, so is hurt by the cruel comments from strangers.

'The only condemnation I don’t accept this week has been cracks about my addiction. Because it’s a sexist double-standard I don’t accept and will always fight.

'Robin Williams, Billy Connelly, Barry Humphries to name a few all suffered the same affliction but it is rarely mentioned in a negative way, as a woman it has much darker and hurtful connotations.'

Standing up to online trolls is likely to be an important issue for the comedienne who was a close friend of the late Charlotte Dawson. 

The two hilarious women starred on The Celebrity Apprentice together in 2012. 

Charlotte Dawson spoke out frequently about how damaging negative comments online can be for everyone, making a point of tracking down and shaming Twitter trolls who had told her to kill herself.

Dawson reached out to O'Loughlin to see if she was okay, only two weeks before taking taking her own life in February this year, O'Loughlin revealed in an interview with news.com.au. 

Adam Hills has not publically responded to any of Fiona O'Loughlin's comments. 

Adam Hills is yet to respond to O'Loughlin's comments.  

Adam Hills' comments were made in March 2013 on his Channel 4 program, The Last Leg, during a segment in which he rants about what is annoying him in the world that week.

Hills angry tirade went viral, in which he told Rivers 'f*** you' and to 'get a plastic surgeon to grow yourself a new soul'

Adam Hills took offence to the comments Joan Rivers made about Brit pop star Adele, in which Rivers made jokes about Adele's weight
