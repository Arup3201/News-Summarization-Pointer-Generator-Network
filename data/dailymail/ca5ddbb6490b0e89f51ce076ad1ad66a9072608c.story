The first photo of a 15-year-old who broke his neck in a tackle during a junior rugby league match last month has emerged, showing him sitting up in a wheelchair in hospital.

Curtis Landers, who fractured his C2 and C3 vertebrae on May 24, moved from his bed to a wheelchair on Tuesday so he could spend time on a verandah at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital.

The teenager also spent some time with Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon, who suffered an almost idential injury earlier in the year.

Just two months ago, Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon, 22, fractured his c4 and c5 vertebrae.

He is staying on the floor below Curtis at the hospital.

Curtis is making small steps towards getting better, and is now swallowing and eating ice cream on his own as he recovers from his severe injuries.

The Facebook page set up to support Curtis also revealed he was 'eating more and more and there was slight movement in his legs today.'

He had breathing tubes removed and started swallowing on his own on Saturday.

'Curt's making good progress. After the speech therapist helped him to swallow, he's been eating soft foods, in particular ice cream,' the Curtis Landers Facebook page posted last night.

'Today, was a big step to get him out of bed and into a wheelchair. He spent half an hour on the verandah and enjoyed the fresh air.

'His voice is also getting stronger.'

Curtis has been in a serious but stable condition in hospital since he was flown from Port Macquarie to undergo surgery following the freak accident.

He has received immense support from community groups in his suburb of Forster and across NSW in the past few weeks.

Aaron Temple, president of Curtis' football club Forster-Tuncurry Hawks, told MailOnline last month that his stint in hospital would be long-term.

'He's looking at 12 months in hospital,' he said.

Curtis' parents, Kevin and Marie, are understood to be struggling with news of their son's accident.

'His father is just beside himself. They did everything together, they were very close. They are taking it very tough,' Mr Temple said.
