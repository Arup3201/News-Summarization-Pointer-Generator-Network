Swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker has found herself accidentally tangled up in the Oklahoma racist fraternity scandal after fans discovered that she tweeted at one of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers last summer.

In one of the most bizarre twists in the story, the Sports Illustrated covergirl responded last April to a tweet from Levi Pettit - a University of Oklahoma student who was identified by his parents on Tuesday as one of fraternity brothers caught on video signing 'there will never be a n***** SAE.'

Pettit sent Decker a tweet that reportedly said: 'My mom loves you!' 

That tweet - along with Pettit's entire Twitter account - have since been deleted.

Decker graced the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition in 2010. She has since branched out into acting and is married to tennis star Andy Roddick

Twitter user Sienna alerted the model and actress to the tweet. But, through her publicist, said she was just responding to a fan tweet - which she does for all fans

The model responded: 'love your mom :)'

This exchange led some Twitter users to speculate that Decker knew Pettit and his family.  

Decker's rep told Daily Mail Online: ‘She freaked out this morning when she realized. He tweeted at her...  and she, as she does with all her fans, tweeted him back.

'He wrote something like "My mom loves your show" to which she responded "I love your mom."

'She does not know him or his family and is certainly not a fan of racism.'

The rep said he believes Levitt tweeted at the star on April 7 as her now-defunct CBS show 'Friends With Better Lives' was airing on TV. 

A Twitter user discovered the exchange on Tuesday night and tweeted at the 'Battleship' actress: 'did you know he is one of the accused?'
