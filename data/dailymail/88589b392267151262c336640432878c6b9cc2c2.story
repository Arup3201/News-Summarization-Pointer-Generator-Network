Labour and the Scottish Nationalists could form a ‘permanent alliance’ at Westminster, it is claimed today.

Despite mounting pressure on Ed Miliband to rule out any deal with the rampant SNP, one Labour strategist has floated the idea of an enduring ‘German-style’ agreement with the party, according to the New Statesman magazine.

It was described as a ‘CDU-CSU scenario’, mirroring a deal between Angela Merkel’s Christian Democrats with the Christian Social Union in the German state of Bavaria.

The CDU does not stand candidates in Bavaria in exchange for support in Germany’s Bundestag from the CSU.

Labour peer Lord Foulkes, a former MP in Scotland, broke ranks last night to insist Mr Miliband should rule out any post-election deal.

‘Every Labour MP and peer to whom I’ve spoken thinks we should rule out any kind of deal with the SNP. What are we waiting for?’ he demanded.

A national poll last night found 61 per cent of voters would be unhappy with a power-sharing deal involving the SNP.

Labour voters were marginally more sympathetic to the idea, with 44 per cent in favour of some sort of deal, the survey by former Tory treasurer Lord Ashcroft found.

While the SNP has indicated it would not enter a formal coalition, it has suggested it would prop up a minority Labour government in key Commons votes in exchange for concessions.

A Labour source insisted the idea of a permanent deal that would mean the party withdrawing from Scotland was ‘b*******’.

Tony Blair’s £1,000 donations for each of Labour’s 106 key battleground seats have sparked a furious row in the party, after two candidates turned down the cash.

The former prime minister’s spin doctor Alastair Campbell branded them ‘attention seeking’ in a furious rant on Twitter.

Sally Keeble, a junior minister under Mr Blair, announced yesterday that she would be turning down the money.

She was MP for Northampton North and is now trying to resurrect her political career after losing her seat in 2010 in the wake of the expenses scandal. It followed the decision by Dundee East candidate Lesley Brennan to also reject the cash.

Mr Campbell wrote on Twitter: ‘To attention seeking candidates rejected TB money 1. He won more Labour seats than anyone 2. Tories are loaded 3. Do you want to win?’

Labour activists responded angrily and praised the two women refusing the cash.

Labour said the money was being accepted on behalf of the whole party and indicated it was not for individual candidates to refuse.

A Lord Ashcroft poll released yesterday has given the Tories a clear lead for the second week in a row. They were on 34 per cent, unchanged on last week, while Labour support was put at 30 per cent, down one point.
