Southampton maintained their good pre-season form with a comfortable 1-0 win over Bournemouth at the Goldsands Stadium on Friday evening.

Ronald Koeman’s side have yet to concede a goal this pre-season and, despite a number of high-profile departures this summer, already look to be picking up where they left off last season.

The Saints quickly asserted themselves of their Championship rivals and took the lead in the 20th minute when Lloyd Isgrove headed home from a cross in the 20th minute in a well-worked attack.

£10.3million signing Dusan Tadic made his first appearance on British soil for the Saints

The Welsh midfielder earned rave reviews on loan at Peterborough last season and is now back in the fold at St Mary’s.

The
 visitors dominated their hosts immediately after the goal, creating a 
couple of good chances, including a wonderful opportunity for Graziano 
Pelle, who impressed on the night, to double the advantage but the 
Italian’s shot was blocked by the Bournemouth goalkeeper.

Bournemouth: Buchel, Smith, Cook, Elphick, Daniels, McQuoid, Gosling, O'Kane, Pugh, Kermorgant, Wilson.

Southampton: Boruc, Clyne, Fonte, Yoshida, Targett, S. Davis, Ward-Prowse, Tadić, Ramírez, Isgrove, Pellè.

Subs: K. Davis (GK), Stephens, Hooiveld, McCarthy, Flannigan, Cork, Reed, McQueen, Sharp, Mayuka, Gallagher.

Attendance: 7,421

£10.3million
 signing Dusan Tadic made his first appearance for Southampton on 
British soil but struggled to make much of an impact in the first half.

Midfielder Gaston Ramirez looked lively on his first 45 minutes of action since returning from World Cup duty with Uruguay.

Bournemouth’s
 only real effort in the first half came in the 39th minute when Josh McQuoid’s 
cross looped awkwardly off Saints defender Matt Targett but Boruc 
scrambled the ball away from the danger area.

Left back Target impressed in his bid to make the position his own since the departure of Luke Shaw to Manchester United. 

The Cherries thought they had equalised late on when an Ian Harte free-kick was flicked past Boruc but the linesman's flag saved the visitors' blushes.

Before the game Southampton announced that highly-rated 19-year-old Harrison Reed had signed a new four-year deal.

The
 England Under-19 international, who came on as a substitute in the 60th
 minute, has played in all four of Saints’ pre-season friendlies so far 
this summer, and looks set to play a big role under new coach Ronald 
Koeman in the coming campaign.
