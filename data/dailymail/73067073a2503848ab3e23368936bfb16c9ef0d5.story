Michael Schumacher is being given muscle training in order to stop his muscles from withering away as he enters his fifth week in a medically induced coma.

The Formula One legend is receiving muscle therapy so that his body will not seize up as he stays sedated in intensive care in Grenoble following his ski accident four weeks ago.

Fears are growing that Michael Schumacher could remain in a 'persistent vegetative state' for the rest of his life even if he wakes up from his coma.

Michael Schumacher is being slowly brought out of his induced coma, his manager has said. His wife Corinna insists her husband is a 'fighter' who will not give up

He was placed into an artificially induced coma shortly after the crash to help his brain heal, but such measures normally last only a maximum of two weeks.

'Patients in comas need limbs and joints moved daily to ensure muscles do not atrophy,' emergency medicine expert Professor Heinzpeter Moecke told The Sun.

One 
Austrian website reported Schumacher, 45, may suffer from 
Apallic Syndrome or persistent vegetative state.

Jean-Marc Orgogozo, Professor of Neurology at the University of Bordeaux, said: 'Every day, every week in a coma the chances decline that the situation is improving'.

But his family insisted he was a 'fighter' as they poured out their heartfelt thanks to fans around the world on his webpage on Tuesday.

'We all know: he is a fighter and will
 not give up!' said his family, adding: 'We are deeply moved that there 
is no let up in the good wishes for Michael from around the world.

'That gives us strength. Thank you all of you!'

But the support of his wife Corinne, 
44, his two teenaged children, brother and closest friends cannot mask 
the fact that more than four weeks in an artificial coma means that he is far from 
anywhere near recovery.

A 
persistent vegetative state is one in which patients with severe brain 
damage are in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness.

This means that if doctors do bring him out of his artificially induced coma he would be unable to speak, move or feed himself.

The
 format.at news website said; 'More than three weeks after the tragic 
skiing accident of the seven-time Formula 1 World Champion Michael 
Schumacher, hope dwindle for a  full recovery.

'For more than three weeks now Schumacher lies in a medically induced coma at the University Hospital in Grenoble. 

He is fed there with probes, washed daily and moved again and again to avoid a bed sores.' 

It
 goes on to speculate that the 'severe damage' he suffered to his brain 
in a ski accident on December 29 could result in the permanent vegative 
state suffered by around 10,000 of his German countrymen.

This
 would mean, if and when he is brought out of the coma by his medical 
team, 'that his condition would hardly be different from the medically 
induced coma'.

Apallic 
Syndrome is always the result of a severe brain injury. The chance of 
recovery from Apallic Syndrome are far below 50 per cent.'

Schumacher's
 condition remains stable but there is a firewall of silence from his 
medical team about the intense battle being waged to try to bring him 
back to normality.

Apallic Syndrome - or persistent vegetative state - occurs when a patient with severe brain damage remains in a state of partial arousal rather than true awareness after waking from a coma.

Patients can breathe on their own and circulate because their brainstem remains intact, but they are largely unresponsive to stimulation. 

The chance of recovery from Apallic Syndrome are far below 50 per cent. 

There is no treatment, but a person can live for many years with the right medical care.

Brain
 injury patients are placed into artificial comas to reduce the amount 
of oxygen that flows into the brain, thus making it work less and giving
 it time to heal.

Such comas usually last for a maximum of two weeks, although there have been instances of patients being under longer. 

As
 Schumacher enters his fourth week in such a state neurological experts 
are starting to doubt whether he might ever recover sufficiently to be 
brought out of his sleep.

Meanwhile, his family have paid tribute to Bundesliga sides Cologne and Schalke on the Formula One legend’s official website.

Players
 from both sides held up a banner which read ‘Get Well Soon! You can do 
it, Michael’ prior to their friendly on Saturday in honour of the 
45-year-old German, who is a Cologne supporter.

The
 message from the seven-time champion’s family is the first in over a 
fortnight and comes just days after it was confirmed that he is in a 
stable condition at Grenoble Hospital.
