Everyone knows getting a taxi during the New York rush hour can be tricky, but when you're worth an estimated $150million, there's surely a button you can press... anything but take the subway.

Unfortunately for Facebook millionaires the Winklevoss twins there was no such button to hand, and they were forced to continue their inner-city journey by train.

Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their legal battle against Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of the social betworking site, were spotted trying to hail a cab in Manhattan.

But when none would stop, they put on their dark glasses and headed underground before buying a pair of metro cards and boarding the R train.

No magic button: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their legal battle against Mark Zuckerberg over the founding of the social betworking site, were spotted boarding the R train in the New York subway

The brothers became overnight multimillionaires in 2008 after winning a drawn-out court battle with Mark Zuckerberg over whose original brainwave led to the founding of Facebook.

The $65 million settlement was intended to resolve a feud 
over whether Zuckerberg stole the idea for what became the world's most 
popular social networking website from the Winklevosses, who like him, 
had attended Harvard.

In disguise: Nobody seemed to bat an eyelid when the brothers rode the R train, wearing dark glasses and listening to music

Press the button: They negotiated the ticket machines in the station before heading through the barriers to the platform

They were awarded $20 million in cash and $45 million in shares.

Unhappy with that result, they later tried to undo the accord 
agreement and claim more money by suggesting it was fraudulent because 
Facebook hid information from them.

But in June 2011, the twins decided not to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court a ruling upholding their $65 million settlement.

Their battle was dramatized in the 2010 film The Social Network.

On the train: The brothers are estimated to be worth around $150 million and their story formed part of the movie The Social Network

No taxi: The twins were earlier seen trying to hail a cab on a busy New York street. But their attempts proved unsuccessful

Wealthy: The brothers became overnight multimillionaires in 2008 after winning a drawn-out court battle with Mark Zuckerberg over whose original brainwave led to the founding of Facebook

In February, the brothers formed Winklevoss Capital as a vehicle to invest their personal wealth.

Their first investment in June was SumZero, which brings together investors to share trading ideas and research, the Wall Street Journal reported.

SumZero.com has 7,500 members and has parallels with the first versions of Facebook, including exclusivity.

The site also allows investors to become members only if they work on the 'buy side'.

SumZero defines that group as investment professionals at hedge funds, mutual funds and private-equity firms.

Analysts from the 'sell side' such as Wall Street banks are not allowed, the report said.

Then in August last year, the pair snagged a $18million home in Southern Los Angeles, California, to be the West Coast home base of their company.

The 8,000 square foot estate was built in 2011 and has five bedrooms and eight bathroom, not to mention an infinity pool and screening room.
