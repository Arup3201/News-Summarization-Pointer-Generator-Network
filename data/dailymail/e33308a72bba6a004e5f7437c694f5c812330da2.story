Callous raiders have shown little regard for the sacrosanct; striking churches in a Lancashire town in the weeks leading up to Christmas.

Smashing stained glass windows for entry, the thieves have attacked eight churches near Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire in the last few weeks.

In their raids, among valuables, they have impiously helped themselves to collection money and even bottles of communion wine.

Now, police are ordering vicars to make sure no items of value are left in the churches over the festive season.

Officers have visited every church in the area to offer crime prevention advice.

Police said hundreds of pounds worth of tools, computers and other items have also been stolen.

Eight incidents reported to police, seven of which have been at churches in the Oswaldtwistle area.

Rev John Holland, said: 'It’s very demoralising for people 
who are trying to do good things in the community to be battered like 
this by people who break in for the fun of it or a bit of communion 
wine.

Immanuel Parish Church in New Lane was targeted twice and has been left with a £900 repair bill.

Coun Peter Britcliffe, who represents Oswaldtwistle on both Hyndburn and Lancashire County Councils said: ‘It’s disgraceful that not even churches are not sacred any more.

Rev John Holland says the break-ins are 'demoralising' when the church is trying to do good in the community

‘Traditionally churches are filled with beautiful ornaments and collections for the poor and those things should be safe from thieves.

‘It is just so very sad that these things are happening at this time of year when we celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.’

Rev John Holland, said: ‘I’m very disappointed that people are targeting churches.

‘We don’t need the hassle of having to deal with repairs. The amount of damage these people are causing when they break in is sometimes worse than what they are taking.

‘We had a break-in earlier in the year in the daytime, when they broke a pane of glass because they could see an organ pipe used to collect money.

‘We now have to keep the building locked - even in daylight hours.’

PC Louise Jacks said she believed criminals were targeting churches as the buildings were often empty and unattended at night.

She said: ‘Some of the criminal fraternity have some morals but when people break into a church they are crossing the line.’

PCSO James Gorrie said officers had reminded those in charge of churches to make sure their alarms and security lights were working.

He added: ‘While we have high visibility patrols out and about we have also got plain clothes officers working through the night and they are paying special attention to these churches.’
