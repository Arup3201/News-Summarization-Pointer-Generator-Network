A British adventurer has battled treacherous seas capsizing five times to become the first person to paddle solo from Japan to Alaska.

Sarah Outen, 28, arrived in Adak in the Aleutian Islands last night 
after taking 150 days to row some 3,750 nautical miles in her boat Happy Socks.

Ms
 Outen, from Rutland, believes she is the first person 
to complete the voyage which saw her propose to her girlfriend Lucy 
Allen, 27, on a satellite phone, on the way.

Success: Ms Outen arrived in Adak in the Aleutian Islands after taking 150 days to row 3,750 nautical miles

'I have had some of the most intense and memorable months of my life out on the Pacific,' she said.

'It has been brilliant and brutal at the same time. And it has been a privilege.

'But
 I have pushed myself to my absolute limits both physically and mentally
 to make land here in Alaska, and body and mind are now exhausted.'

The
 rower capsized five times during her journey and was 
confined to her cabin for days because of the perilous conditions.

Plummeting
 temperatures and poor light made rowing 'incredibly demanding', she 
said, and towards the end of the trip, she narrowly missed being struck 
by a cargo ship.

Support: Locals in Adak welcome Sarah as she rowed ashore 'crying and grinning' last night

But she still managed to propose to her girlfriend Lucy, a farmer from Blewbury, Oxfordshire, from the middle of the ocean.

'I cannot wait to be with Lucy again,' she said, as she arrived on dry land.

Ms
 Outen has kept her army of Twitter followers up-to-date throughout her 
journey and revealed she 'cried and grinned' as she rowed ashore, 
welcomed by locals.

Yesterday she tweeted: 'Wobbled my way ashore, patted Happy Socks. Then hugged... Relief. Joy. Disbelief. Happy, happy days'.

She added: 'Hot bath, food and bed. A dry one that doesn't roll. There's a storm tonight. We got in just in time. Phew.'

Phoning in: She kept in touch using a satellite phone from her cabin where she stored her food and slept

It
 is the second time Ms Outen has attempted such a feat. Last year she 
attempted to cross the Pacific but was forced to abandon her challenged 
when she was caught in a tropical storm.

Her boat Gulliver was badly damaged after being battered by 15 metre high waves and 80mph winds.

This
 time she planned to paddle from Japan to Canada but changed her route to land in the  Aleutian Islands a couple of weeks ago when she was battered by more high winds and 
bad weather.

Speaking from sea earlier this year, she told MailOnline about the first time she capsized on her latest leg, which began in April.

She said: 'The first time was a bit of a relief actually because I was very nervous about it.

All
 alone: She plots her journey from her cabin. She stores six months 
worth of food on board and uses a desalination machine to convert 
seawater into drinking water to cook, drink and wash

Charity:
 Sarah's aim is to raise more than £100,000 in sponsorship for her good 
causes - CoppaFeel!, The Jubilee Sailing Trust, MNDA and WaterAid

Rescue:
 Sarah first attempted the row in May last year, but the challenge was 
cut short when she hit a typhoon several hundred miles off the coast of 
Japan. She is pictured here being rescued by the Japanese coastguard

Rescuers help Sarah to safety after her boat capsized more than 20 times and suffered irreparable damage

'Last
 year I capsized 20 times and it was really a frightening experience to 
be in the cabin with the water coming in, so I was quite nervous about 
it.'

Ms
 Outen's trip forms part of a round-the-world expedition. She hopes to 
eventually circle the globe using only human power: cycling, rowing and 
kayaking more than 20,000 miles.

She
 embarked on the challenge in April 2011 and the first year saw her 
cycle and kayak more than 11,000 miles from London to Choshi, Japan.

Next year she will return to the Aleutian Islands to kayak to mainland Alaska. She aims to raise more than £100,000 for charity.

£100,000 in sponsorship for her good causes - CoppaFeel!, The Jubilee
