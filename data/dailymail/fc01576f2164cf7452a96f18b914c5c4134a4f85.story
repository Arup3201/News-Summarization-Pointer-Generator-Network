With more than a $10 billion to her name, it's little surprise that Steve Jobs' businesswoman widow likes to treat herself.

Laurene Powell, 51, was spotted grinning after a shopping trip in St. Barts with her new beau, ex-Washington D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty, during their Caribbean vacation on Tuesday evening.

Fenty, 44, carried shopping bags as he followed his girlfriend to a boat at the dock, presumably to return to their yacht, where they were seen sunning themselves earlier this week.

The happy duo looked at ease as they walked together along the dock before being helped into the small boat, where they sat close to each other.

Day out: Laurene Powell, 51, and Adrian Fenty, 44, were seen on shore during their Caribbean vacation on Tuesday night after an apparent shopping trip. The couple have been on a Cayman Island yacht this week

All smiles: The couple, who started dating nearly two years ago, looked at ease as they headed to their boat

The couple was first rumored to be dating in the summer of 2013 but these are among the first photos of their budding romance. 

Powell was left widowed after Apple founder Steve Jobs passed away, aged 56, from complications from pancreatic cancer in October 2011. They had three children together and Powell is also step-mother to Jobs' daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs.

Fenty, mayor of Washington D.C. between 2007 and 2011, formally announced his separation from his wife of 15 years, Michelle, in January 2013. They also have three children together.

Sources told the Washington Post that summer that Fenty and Powell started seeing each other around the same time, but there is no suggestion that Powell had anything to do with the separation.

It is believed the two met at a Houston education conference in 2011 and bonded over school reform; Powell is the founder of Emerson Collective, which advocates for education reform, among others, while Fenty's focus during his mayorship with education.

Watchful: Fenty, who stepped down as DC mayor in 2011, watched as his girlfriend climbed into the boat

Night out: The couple, who first met in 2011, settled into the boat before heading back to their yacht

Close: Fenty, 44, got close to his businesswoman and philanthropist girlfriend, 51, in the boat

Alone time: The couple has six children and one step-child among them from their previous marriages

The following year, Fenty joined the board of College Track, a non-profit program for underserved students wanting to go to college that was co-founded by Powell.

'Adrian Fenty is one of our country's great advocates for education reform,' she said in a statement at the time. 'His sense of urgency and record of accomplishment is unparalleled.'

The pair were first friends, sources told the Washington Post, before they started dating at the start of 2013. In June 2014, the couple was pictured at a French open match together.

Powell had married Jobs two years after meeting him when he gave a talk to Stanford Business School while she was a student there. 

Former flames: Powell is pictured left with her husband, Apple founder Steve Jobs, who passed away in October 2011. Right, Fenty and his wife Michelle are pictured together in 2010, three years before their split

Their wedding took place in March 1991 at a hotel in Yosemite Valley, and the ceremony was led by a Zen Buddhist monk, Kobun Chino Otogawa, in keeping with Jobs' religious beliefs.

Their eldest child, a son named Reed, was born six months later, and the couple had two daughters, Erin and Eve, in the years following. 

While she was on the boards of several companies and charities during his lifetime, it was only after he died that she began to speak publicly to draw attention to the causes that mattered to her.

They were married for 20 years and after his death, she inherited an estate of about $10 billion.

Despite being one of the richest women in the U.S. she has kept a deliberately low profile as she continues with her charitable work.

Since Fenty left the mayor's office, he has focused on acting as a consultant to education tech companies and working as a special adviser at Andreessen Horowitz.
