Genetic liver disease has been cured in living, adult mice for first time using a ‘jaw-dropping’ genome-editing technique that could soon be used on humans.

The technique, named Crispr, can make tiny changes to the huge database of the DNA molecule with what scientists describe as 'pinpoint' accuracy.

Crispr – pronounced ‘crisper’- was used to correct a single ‘letter’ of the mices' genetic alphabet which had been mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism.

Scientists claim a similar mutation in the same gene causes the inherited liver disease in humans, raising hopes that clinical trials on patients could begin in the next few years.

They believe detailed alterations can be made to DNA, potentially allowing scientists to treat genetic disorders such as sickle-cell anaemia, Down's syndrome and Huntington’s disease.

The new technique uses ‘cutting enzymes’ to target specific parts of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, without introducing unintended mutations or flaws.

The enzymes were discovered in 1987 and initially dismissed as ‘junk DNA’. It has since been identified as a defence used by bacteria against invading viruses.

Crispr – pronounced ‘crisper’- was used 
to correct a single ‘letter’ of mice’s genetic alphabet which had been 
mutated in the gene associated in liver metabolism.

MIT researchers were able to cure the 
rare disease in mice by changing around a third of their liver cells 
using three guided RNA strands.

The
 RNA strands acted as ‘guide’ molecules to find the mutated base pair, 
known as FAH. The Case9 enzyme, which was attached to the RNA, was then 
able to repair the fault.

Using
 this approach, the correct gene was inserted in about one of every 250 
hepatocytes — the cells that make up most of the liver. Over the next 30
 days, those healthy cells began to multiply and replace diseased liver 
cells.

But its potential was only fully realised two years ago when scientists discovered that it can be combined with a DNA-sniping enzyme called Cas9 and used to edit the human genome.

For this study, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) used Crispr technology to find and correct the mutated DNA base pair in a liver gene called LAH.

The mutation can lead to a deadly build-up of the amino acid tyrosine in 1 in 100,000 people and has to be treated with drugs and a low-protein diet.

Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last year described the Crispr technique as 'a real game-changer'

Scientists believe the technique is so accurate it might be used for gene therapy - replacing faulty genes with healthy ones - on incurable viruses such as HIV and diseases such as cancer.

Controversially, it might also be used to correct gene defects in human IVF embryos, allowing disorders to be ‘ironed out’ before a baby is born.

Previously gene therapy relied on using viruses to insert DNA at random into the human genome - an inaccurate and risky process.

‘What’s exciting about this approach is that we can actually correct a defective gene in a living adult animal,’ said MIT’s Daniel Anderson, the senior author of the paper.

Scientists have developed other gene-editing systems based on DNA-slicing enzymes, also known as nucleases, but those complexes can be expensive and difficult to assemble.

Earlier this year two Chinese 
monkeys, named Ningning and Mingming, became the first 
genetically-modified primates to be born using a powerful Crispr 
technique.

Writing in 
the journal, Cell, the team from Nanjing Medical University reported the
 successful delivery of twin female long-tailed macaques using the 
technique.

Scientists have 
previously used the new genome-editing technology to delete, insert, and
 modify DNA in human cells grown in petri dishes.

ut
 the new study showed for the first time that Crispr can create healthy 
primates with their DNA modified at specific targeted genes.

Jiahao
 Sha, who led the Chinese team, said that Crispr could be used to create
 monkeys that carry genetic faults that lead to diseases in humans for 
animal testing.

The 
technology can also be used to grow human organs in the lab, and used to
 test drugs, or to monitor how serious diseases can affect the body.

Precise changes in DNA are also being investigated as a way to make people resistant to HIV.

‘The Crispr system is very easy to configure and customise,’ said Professor Anderson, who is also a member of MIT’s Institute for Medical Engineering and Science.

He added that other systems ‘can potentially be used in a similar way to the Crispr system, but with those it is much harder to make a nuclease that’s specific to your target of interest.’

Last year, Nobel Prize winner Professor Craig Mello last night described the new technique as ‘a real game-changer’

Writing in the Independent, he said: ‘Crispr is absolutely huge. ‘It’s incredibly powerful and it has many applications, from agriculture to potential gene therapy in humans.

‘This is really a triumph of basic science. It’s a tremendous breakthrough with huge implications for molecular genetics. It’s a real game-changer.

‘It’s one of those things that you have to see to believe. I read the scientific papers like everyone else but when I saw it working in my own lab, my jaw dropped. A total novice in my lab got it to work.'
