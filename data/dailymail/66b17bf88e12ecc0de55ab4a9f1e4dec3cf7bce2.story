Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich's partner has sparked an internet firestorm after an online magazine published a photo of her sitting on a chair made to resemble a half-naked black woman - on Martin Luther King Day.

Buro 24/7 used the horrendously offensive image of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage. Miroslava Duma, the blog's editor, also posted the insensitive photo on Instagram.

Both were met with an immediate barrage of disgusted comments, and Duma quickly deleted the picture from Instagram and cropped out the chair on Buro 24/7.

Outrage: Buro 247 used the horrendously offensive image, pictured, of Dasha Zhukova Monday to illustrate an unrelated interview about the former model's new magazine, Garage

'This is incredibly racist,' Organizing for Women's Liberation tweeted Monday, after news of the unbelievable picture spread.

In the image, the Moscow-born 32-year-old, wearing a crisp white shirt buttoned nearly to the top and blue jeans, perches on an extremely life-like black mannequin who is naked save for a pair of leather-look black panties, a dominatrix-style belt, elbow length gloves and knee-high boots.

The dummy is laying on her back with her knees bent and a cushion, which Zhukova is sitting on, is balanced on her bottom.

Her neck is propped up off the floor uncomfortably, as if she is straining to look at her master, and her amble, naked bosom is pressed provocatively against her body.

Zhukova, staring at the camera, appears the complete opposite of the black woman she's weighing down.

Zhukova's publicist blasted the use of the image on MLK day and said her client has a strong record of promoting diversity. She said it was 'regrettable' that the image of the chair by Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard had been used on such a sensitive day by the blog, and pointed out that such a use took the work completely out of context.

Zhukova herself added: 'This photograph, which has been published completely out of context, is of an art work intended specifically as a commentary on gender and racial politics. I utterly abhor racism, and would like to apologise to anyone who has been offended by this image.'

The website also responded Tuesday after the controversy.

'Buro 24/7 is against racism and everything that may humiliate people,' a spokesman said in a statement.

'The chair presented on a photo should be seen like nothing but a piece of contemporary art. We sincerely apologize if the posted photos insulted our readers.

FashionBombDaily.com editor Claire Sulmers was among the first to express her disbelief, claiming the photo's message was startlingly clear: 'White dominance and superiority, articulated in a seemingly serene yet overtly degrading way.'

She wrote on her blog that racism remained rampant in the art and fashion worlds and this needed to stop.

Editor: Dasha Zhukova is the editor-in-chief of Garage magazine, pictured, which focused on art and fashion. She is also described as a Russian socialite

Dasha Zhukova, the partner of 
Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich and editor-in-chief of 
bi-annual art and fashion magazine Garage, was born in Moscow but grew up in California.

The 32-year-old's father is a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and her mother was a Russian 
scientist. Her parents split when she was 3 and she and her mother moved to the US 
when she was 10.

She went to a privileged Jewish day school in California and graduated the University of California, Santa Barbara
 before returning to Moscow and later moving to London.

In
 2008, Zhukova founded the IRIS Foundation, a non-profit organization 
dedicated to promoting contemporary culture.

A year later, she was 
appointed editor-in-chief of the fashion magazine Pop but she only 
lasted three issues.

She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion, have 
two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15
 April 2013. Abramovich has five other children from a previous 
relationship.

Zhukova's was previously with Marat Safin, the retired 
former Tennis World Champion Number 1 but the couple split in 2005.

'The art and fashion industries are 
the few bastions of society where blatant racism and ignorance are given
 the greenlight in the name of creativity,' Sulmers complained.

Twitter erupted after Duma published the article, presumably not realizing citizens in the U.S. and around the world were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality.

User Ric Caric wrote, 'I guess Garage Magazine thought that today would be a great day to advertise their racism,' while Julee A. Wilson tweeted, 'MLK is turning in his grave and I'm cursing these people's stupidity with all my heart and soul! MAJOR fail!'

User Nikia tweeted: 'Extremely disappointed in Miroslava Duma and Buro247 for posting this nonsense, especially on a day like today. smh,' and Alex von Tunzelmann wrote, 'Even in the grim, tasteless world of fashion photography, this revolting racist image- pub'd on MLK Day!- stands out.'

Zhukova was born in Moscow to a prominent Russian businessman and oil magnate and a Russian scientist but her parents split when she was three and at 10 she moved to the US with her mother.

She went to a privileged day school in California and then attended the University of California, Santa Barbara before returning to Moscow and later moving to London.

She and Abramovich, who is worth $14 billion and known for his luxury yachts, have two children Aaron Alexander, born 3 December 2009 and Leah Lou, born 15 April 2013.

Offensive timing: The horror picture was published on a day U.S. citizens and many people from other countries were remembering the Civil Rights movement and Martin Luther King's struggles for racial equality
