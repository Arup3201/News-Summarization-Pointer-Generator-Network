Olivier Giroud has heaped praise on Arsenal youngster Gedion Zelalem, but maintains if he can add more aggression to his game he can improve even further.

The 28-year-old, who scored in Arsenal's impressive win at the home of the champions Manchester City on Sunday, has revealed he is a big fan of 17-year-old Zelalem.

The young midfielder made his Champions League debut for the Gunners earlier this season, coming on as a half-time substitute against Galatasaray in a comprehensive 4-1 group stage win.

In an interview with Sports Illustrated Giroud said: 'I think he could put more aggressiveness in his game.

'I know he's not a strong fellow, but he's a fantastic footballer. 

'Technically, he's amazing, and he sees everything before the other players. He needs to play more, but he has fantastic quality.'
