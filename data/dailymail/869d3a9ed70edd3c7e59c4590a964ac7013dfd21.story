Residents in a mountainside village in Indonesia continued to flee their homes today as a volcano that had lain dormant for more than 400 years erupted for the second time this week.

An estimated 25,000 people have now been displaced to temporary evacuation centres as a result of Mount Sinabung in North Sumatra, which has erupted more than 50 times in one night earlier this month.

Eleven people are thought to have 
been killed, with hundreds more falling ill after breathing in dangerous
 gases and ash according to local reports.

Thousands of villagers have been evacuated to temporary shelters as the volcano which was dormant for more than 400 years before its recent activity remains a risk

Officials confirmed at least 11 people have died as a result of the volcano's eruptions and hundreds are thought to have taken ill after breathing in dangerous gases

Officials
 expect the number of evacuees to rise as the volcano, which erupted in 
2010 after laying dormant for four centuries, remains a risk to all 
those in its perimeter.

Villagers were forced to scramble from their homes last week after the volcano erupted 50 times in one night, spurting lava and gas upon residential areas miles away.

Parts of villages remain blanketed by volcanic ash while some buildings have been entirely destroyed.

The village of Sigarang Garang has been buried by debris and mud following an eruption on Sunday morning.

The few remaining residents were pictured shepherding livestock and children away from the volcano towards one of the many nearby shelters this morning.

A damaged house is among the thousands abandoned by its occupants since the volcano started erupting sporadically in September

Last week the villages of Tiga Pancur, Jewara and Pintu Besi were struck by lava and rocks after Mount Sinabung erupted more than 50 times.

A spokesman for the country's disaster mitigation agency confirmed a danger zone had been mapped out at three miles from the crater's mouth, but was extended an extra mile.

More than 25,000 people have been evacuated from villages surrounding the volcano and placed in temporary shelters since the crater's alert status was heightened in November.

One man said: 'We've lost everything.

'We wonder about our lives after this disaster,' said the father-of-four who is among those in a cramped shelter in Telegah village.

The 8,530ft mountain has erupted sporadically since September. It had 
been dormant for over 400 years in 2010 when a sudden eruption killed 
two people.

The area is vulnerably to volcanic eruptions as it lies in what is known as the Pacific 'ring of fire' which is home to a cluster of active craters

Transportation Ministry spokesman Bambang Ervan said airlines had been notified to avoid routes near the mountain.

Mount Sinabung is among about 130 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on what is known as the Pacific 'Ring of Fire'.

The cluster of volcanoes in the basin of the Pacific Ocean is where 90 per cent of the world's earthquakes and occur.

Authorities raised the alert of Mount Sinabung to the highest level in November after a string of sporadic eruptions. Though no casualties were reported last week it is now understood that as many as 11 people have died.

National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said last week: 'Hot lava spewed from the volcano some 60 times, reaching up to five kilometers southeast of the crater.

'This outpour is the biggest weâ€™ve seen in all the recent eruptions.'

A spokesman for the island's National Disaster Mitigation Agency described this month's activity as some of the worst the agency had seen

Earlier this week villagers were woken in the dead of the night to the sound of the volcano spewing lava, ash and rock for miles

Abandoned homes and buildings have been destroyed in recent weeks following the volcano's sporadic activity, with as many as 25,000 people now without homes
