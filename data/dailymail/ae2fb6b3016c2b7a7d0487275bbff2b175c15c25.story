Divers today recovered what could be more human remains at the site of the wreck of the Costa Concordia, raising hopes the last of the shipping disaster's 32 victims may soon be laid to rest.

The cruise liner sank last year in shallow waters off the Italian island of Giglio.

It was hauled upright last month in a complicated 19-hour salvage operation.

Divers have been combing the ship and surrounding areas for the bodies of Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Indian crew member Russel Rebello since it was judged sufficiently secure for investigation.

Human remains were initially discovered during the operation to right the ship in an area previously identified as of major 
interest.

Results of tests to identify them are still to be announced.

The head of Italy's civil protection agency Franco Gabrielli said Thursday that the latest remains are currently undergoing DNA tests.' 

'We are waiting for the results of the analysis.'

The identification process is expected to take at least a week.

Searching: Italian Fire Brigade Divers meet for an operational briefing to search for Costa Concordia victims

Missing: The search resumes for the missing bodies of Maria Grazia Trecarichi and Russel Rebello, whose bodies were never found after the Costa Concordia capsized on January 13

Last month, the families of the two remaining missing 
victims arrived on the island of Giglio in the hope their loved 
ones' remains would be found.

The brother of Indian waiter Rebello said that his entire family is praying that he had been found.

‘I’ve been waiting for a week since they began work on the ship. I’m trying to control myself but I’m very emotional.

‘I’ve
already warned my sister-in-law and my mother and they are praying that
the remains turn out to be those of my brother. It’s important to have a
place to cry and a place to pray.’

As it was: The Costa Concordia lay on its side for more than a year before rescuers were able to move it

Salvage: The capsized cruise liner was brought pulled from the sea bed into its original floating position, shown here in three stages, during the a lengthy 'parbuckling' operation outside Giglio harbour in September.

Righted: Crews have been able to go to work on the crippled cruise ship after the 19-hour operation

Moving in: Overseen by Italian police, divers have now been able to access the part of the seabed where the ship once lay

Captain Francesco Schettino, pictured leaving a court in Grosseto earlier this week, is charged with manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship before all aboard were evacuated

Mrs Trecarichi, the last remaining missing passenger, was on the cruise to celebrate 
her 50th birthday with her friend Luisa, her daughter Stefania and her 
daughter’s friend. The two young people survived.

As
the ship sank, she rang her husband, but in a heartbreaking 
twist of fate he failed to answer, having gone to bed early.

She had not got onto a lifeboat with her daughter because she had returned to her cabin to get a warm jacket.

The Sicilian mother-of-one then rang a friend, saying that Stefania was on a boat and she was waiting for the next one.

The phone call was then interrupted by a shout: 'My God my God we are sliding into the water.'

Her grieving husband Elio Vincenzi spoke last month of his hope that he will finally be able to bring his wife home.

He said: ‘I want to bring her home back to Sicily, her homeland. I think only of her.'

The successful parbuckling operation had given him new hope of closure, he said.

Stefania,
18, is now competing in the Miss Italia beauty pageant in memory of
her mother, who had always encouraged her to enter.

The ship's captain Francesco Schettino is currently on trial accused of manslaughter, causing the 
shipwreck and abandoning ship.

The boat is due to be towed away from the
Mediterranean holiday island, probably by next spring, and broken up into
scrap.
