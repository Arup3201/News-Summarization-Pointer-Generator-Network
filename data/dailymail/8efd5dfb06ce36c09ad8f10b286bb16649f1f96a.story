A High Court family judge who divorced after committing adultery with a younger woman called yesterday for the abolition of the legal rights and responsibilities of marriage.

Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 57, said that there was no difference between the relationships of married and unmarried couples, and condemned the divorce system that gives special protection to wives.

‘It is not the role of the state, in my humble opinion, to go round telling people how they should form their relationships,’ he said.

Sir Nicholas Mostyn, 57, said there was no evidence to suggest married relationship is more stable than cohabitation and condemned the divorce system that gives special protection to wives

He said state support for marriage was ‘social engineering’ and there was no evidence to show a married relationship is more stable than cohabitation.

‘I do not support two classes of adjudication depending on whether there happens to be a marriage,’ he said. ‘I support the extension of the existing system of judicial equitable distribution to the unmarried, warts and all.’

The judge, who sits as Mr Justice Mostyn, said there should be no difference in the way the courts treat the break-up of relationships of any kind.

His own divorce came in 2012 after he walked out on his wife Lucy in 2010 to live with divorce barrister Elizabeth Saunders, 42. Mrs Saunders’s barrister husband Mark was shot dead by police marksmen during a siege off King’s Road in Chelsea in 2008.

During his less than amicable parting from his wife, Sir Nicholas was reported to have obtained an order to stop her speaking publicly about their break-up. However, his lawyers refused to say which court granted the order, or give any detail of its terms.

Lady Mostyn refused and later told friends that the attempt to silence her amounted to ‘pathetic bullying’.

The couple’s joint assets ran into millions of pounds. They had a Grade II-listed home in Little Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, with hundreds of acres.

Sir Nicholas was until 2010 a divorce QC. Said to have earned up to £500 an hour, he represented clients including Sir Paul McCartney and Earl Spencer. His success on behalf of wives earned him the nickname Mr Payout.

His views, delivered in a speech to a family law conference, come at a time of increasing pressure from senior judges for new laws to give cohabitees, and in particular women who are long-term unmarried partners, new legal rights when relationships break up.

Sir James Munby, the judge who heads the Family Division, said last week that cohabitees should be protected by law, and married couples who want to divorce should no longer need to go to court.

Sir Nicholas’s speech was aimed at Sir Paul Coleridge, the High Court family judge who stepped down this year amid a row over his launch of a think tank, the Marriage Foundation, aimed at rallying political support to strengthen the institution of marriage.

Sir Nicholas said he did not agree with Sir Paul and added that marriage was already discriminated in favour of through the tax system.

But researcher and author on the family Patricia Morgan said: ‘The judge is wrong to say there is discrimination in favour of marriage.

‘Marriage is discriminated against in the tax and benefit system. The only benefit is through inheritance, and couples who want to marry are not thinking about that – it is way down the line.’

And Harry Benson, research director of the Marriage Foundation, accused Sir Nicholas of saying that ‘marriage doesn’t matter’.

In 2011 Earl Spencer dropped a legal action against Sir Nicholas, who represented him in his 2009 divorce, and whom the earl blamed for his loss of £1million in the settlement.

During the row Earl Spencer revealed that Sir Nicholas had told him that he had named seven piglets on his farm after Sir James Munby, the judge in the case. Sir Nicholas named his piglets James, Munby, Self-regarding, Pompous, Publicity, Seeking and Pillock.
