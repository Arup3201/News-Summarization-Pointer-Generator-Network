Thanks to the smash hit success of Calendar Girls, stripping off has become one of the most popular ways to raise money for a good cause.

Now the University of Liverpool Women's Rugby League team has become the latest to produce a charity calendar - but one of the two causes supported is themselves.

The team, who have been struggling to find enough cash to pay for equipment and travel, will benefit from some of the money, while the rest will go to Joining Jack.

The calender will raise money for the charity Joining Jack, which raises awareness and money to fight  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

The charity, which raises awareness and money to fight Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), was set up by the family of six-year-old Jack Johnson from Wigan.

DMD, which currently affects around one in 3,600 boys in the UK, only appears in males and causes progressive muscle wasting. 

Now the rugby team hope their naked calendar will raise awareness of the disease, as well as raising funds to support the search for a cure. 

'We are proud to be raising money for such a good cause,' said team member Olivia Davidson. 'Half the profits from the calendar are going towards Joining Jack to help fund research into a cure for DMD.

'The rest of the money raised will go towards funding our club. Women's Rugby League is not currently widely played at university level and we lack funding to afford equipment and transport to away matches.'

The bold girls head into town not only topless, but barefoot with their rugby boots slung over their shoulders

The girls discuss the finer points of their match strategies... topless obviously 

'We are also trying to encourage other universities to offer the sport to women and this money will help us do this.'

The calendars are being sold for £10 by the team, at the University of Liverpool's sports centre and via uolwrlnakedcalendar.moonfruit.com

Olivia added: 'We would also like to thank Seb Castilho, who donated his time and skill to photograph the calendar.' 

The calender also features themed shots for certain months, such as this New Year's Eve party for January

Of course, being from Liverpool, the calender has to feature a recreation of the famed Beatles image

Looking more than a little chilly, the girls brave the weather for their calender, which will also generate funds for the rugby club itself
