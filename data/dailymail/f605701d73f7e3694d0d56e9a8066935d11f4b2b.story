As Kristen Stewart and Rupert Sanders attempt to rebuild their broken relationships, the Snow White And The Huntsman director's wife believed they had already conquered their marriage woes.

In a frank interview, just two weeks ago with YOU magazine, Liberty Ross revealed her ten-year marriage had suffered due to Rupert's catapulting career in Tinseltown - which led to his absence.

Following last night's news - and photographic evidence - that the 41-year-old engaged in infidelities with the Twilight actress during a tryst last Tuesday, the 'absence' of which Liberty speaks now casts a sinister new light.

Can they survive? Liberty Ross believed her marriage woes to Rupert Sanders had been solved

Bad news: It emerged yesterday that Kristen Stewart had an affair with Liberty Ross' husband Rupert Sanders

Speaking to YOU, Liberty said: 'I 
think that having been a model and so self-sufficient for those years, I
was very ready to get married and have babies.

'I romanticised domesticity for a while, and loved having a shopping list of groceries stuck to the fridge for the first time.

'But moving here (from London to LA) 
and starting a life all over again was a lot harder than I had 
anticipated. I just didn’t think it would be as isolating and daunting 
as it turned out to be.

'I can honestly say that it took me five years to feel happy here.'

The 33-year-old beauty then opened up
even further, insinuating she lived life as a single mother, but never 
actually saying a bad word about her beloved Rupert.

She continued: 'I would never say out loud that I am raising my children alone, but a lot of the time it has felt like that.

Too much: Liberty, pictured with Rupert on the set of Snow White and The Huntsman, has deleted her Twitter

'I went from the glamour of working 
with Karl Lagerfeld and John Galliano to living on an isolated hilltop, 
with my husband gone most of the time.'

However, she seemed to think they had
conquered their differences, adding: 'But that’s why everything feels 
so amazing now. We rode through the really hard times and we stuck it 
out...

'Without them (her siblings, four out
of six whom also live in Los Angeles) I probably would have packed up 
and gone back to London.'

Liberty's world was turned upside down when allegations emerged that K-Stew had an affair with her husband.

And the model and actress, who played 22-year-old Kristen’s mother in 
Snow White and the Huntsman, responded yesterday by tweeting just one word: 'Wow.'

She posted the message on July 24, just moments after Us Weekly called her director husband's spokesperson for comment, according to the magazine.

Liberty,
who has two young children with Rupert, has since deleted her Twitter 
account, presumably due to being bombarded with messages after the news 
broke.

Before deleting her page Liberty had also posted a series of cryptic tweets that seemed to be referencing the alleged affair.

She retweeted a quote from Marilyn Monroe which read: 'Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together.'

She
later followed this with another retweet, this time quoting American 
author and poet Maya Angelou, saying: 'If you find it in your heart to 
care for somebody else, you will have succeeded.'

Liberty played Queen Eleanor to 
Kristen’s Snow White in the box office hit, which was directed by Rupert
and released last month.

Kristen today issued a grovelling apology to her boyfriend, Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, in a uprising public statement.

In a statement to People, she said: 'I'm deeply sorry for the hurt and embarrassment I've caused to those close to me and everyone this has affected.

'This momentary indiscretion has 
jeopardised the most important thing in my life, the person I love and 
respect the most, Rob. I love him, I love him, I'm so sorry.'

Rupert quickly followed suit and issued a statement to People which
said: 'I am utterly distraught about the pain I have caused my family. 
My beautiful wife and heavenly children are all I have in this world. I
love them with all my heart. I am praying that we can get through this 
together.'

Only a few weeks ago, Liberty gushed 
to YOU about how proud she is of her husband since he found 
fame in his own right, compared to when she was the bigger star.

She recalled how she used to call him
'the Hand' and explained: 'In every picture that was taken of me at a 
party or a premiere, he'd be chopped off, and all you would ever see was
his hand.

'At the world premiere in London, I 
had tears in my eyes, because we got out of our fancy car and all of his
fans started screaming his name. The tables had really turned!'

The pair married when Liberty was 24 
and Rupert was 31, and Liberty said of the beginnings of their romance: 
'Once we started going out, I knew he was the one for me. He is a very 
special soul.'

More trouble ahead?: Rupert has signed on to helm the sequel to the Snow White saga starring Kristen

They have seven-year-old daughter Skyla and a five-year-old-son named Tennyson together.

Kristen's infidelity came just months after Robert gave an interview to 
Italian Vanity Fair magazine saying that he has 'never understood' 
people who cheat.

He 
said: 'There is one thing I've never understood: Why people cheat. My 
parents met when my mom was 17 and my father 25, they are still 
together, and seem very happy.

'I grew up believing that you can be together all of your life.'

The
pair made their latest public appearance when they took the stage 
together at the Teen Choice Awards on Sunday – just two days before the 
news broke.

Speaking about his lead actress in 
the role at one of the movie's premieres last month, Rupert said he was 
thrilled by Kristen’s performance.

He
told E! News: 'She's got a great spirit, she's really quite 
rebellious...and feisty and kind of wild. And that's really what I 
wanted the modern Snow White to have.

'I didn't want her to be timid and I didn't want her to be frightened and relying on men, you know. 'She's
very strong and very driven, and I think that's true in her personal 
life... She's got a big weight of the world on her shoulders and she 
carries it incredibly well.'

Snow
White And The Huntsman marks the first major motion picture that Rupert
directed - but he has already signed on to take the helm of the sequel.
