Earthquakes that rattled North Texas last month were concentrated along a fault line that runs through Irving into West Dallas, according to researchers.

Initially, the locations for the series of earthquakes were mapped centered on the former Dallas Cowboys stadium.

However, they have been found to run in a two-mile line north-by-northeast from Texas Highway 114 to Walnut Hill Road along the Trinity River. 

The subsurface fault, which is ancient and has been reactivated, was narrowed down by researchers from Southern Methodist University (SMU) after they surveyed data from earthquake monitoring devices.

There were a reported 26 felt earthquakes in January by the National Earthquake Information Center.

The earthquakes were relatively shallow and concentrated along a narrow two mile line extending from Irving into West Dallas, the preliminary findings revealed.

The fault line was discovered after SMU researchers reviewed data from 20 portable earthquake monitors they installed near the earthquake sites. 

Seismologists said earthquakes have been felt in North Texas because of their location near the surface in the granite basement, according to WFAA.

The largest earthquake to date measured 3.6 in magnitude and there have been five earthquakes measuring over a magnitude of 3.

Earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 to 3.0 are generally the smallest people can feel.

From April 17, 2014 when the earthquake sequence began in Irving and Dallas to January 23, there have been 46 reported earthquakes.

The U.S. Geological Service plotted the epicenters of the first four of nine earthquakes (above) that occurred last month to northeast Irving, a Dallas suburb in North Texas

Some of the earthquakes were located near two wells drilled for shale gas, as well as a wastewater injection well.

The scientists have not drawn any conclusions from the location of the wells and the earthquakes.

As scientists continue to investigate the cause of the earthquakes that occurred on January 6, which were described as 'the largest' since they started happening last April, it is the first step forward.

SMU seismologist Brian Stump, said: 'This is a first step, but an important one, in investigating the cause of the earthquakes. 

'Now that we know the fault's location and depth, we can begin studying how this fault moves – both the amount and direction of motion.'

His colleague Heather DeShon added: 'Then we can move on to what might have triggered it – examining factors both natural and man-made. 

'Sometimes what triggers an earthquake can be very small, so all of these factors have to be considered when looking for that trigger.'

From April 17, 2014 when the earthquake sequence began to January 23, there have been 46 reported earthquakes (above the earthquakes mapped during that time frame)

The mapping of the earthquakes from last month by seismologists will allow for city officials, if the fault remains actives, to know which areas of Dallas and Irving might experience the worst shaking - as there is no prediction for how long the series will last.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has said he is looking at the city's building codes and a separate discussion will take place on whether they need to be changed or not, according to CBSDFW.

SMU plans to continue locating both felt and smaller earthquakes in the area, which will help to refine the geometry of the fault.

The Irving area, with a population topping 250,000, has had more than 25 minor earthquakes since early September, according to Stump. 

About 40 miles west of Irving, a series of small earthquakes rattled the town of Azle a year ago, causing sinkholes and cracks in house foundations. 

Residents blamed fracking and injection disposal wells for drilling waste as the cause but an official finding is still pending.
