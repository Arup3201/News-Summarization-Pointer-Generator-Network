Grim Discovery: Evidence of the attack was found Friday afternoon by a trio of hikers, who came upon a lone backpack lying near a park river

A hiker in Alaska's Denali National Park photographed a grizzly bear for at least eight minutes before the bear mauled and killed him in the first fatal attack in the park's history, officials said Saturday.

Investigators have recovered the camera and looked at the photographs, which show the bear grazing and not acting aggressively before the attack, Denali Park Superintendent Paul Anderson said.

A state trooper shot and killed the bear 
on Saturday, and investigators will examine its stomach contents and use
other tests to confirm it's the animal that killed the hiker.

The hiker was backpacking alone along the Toklat River on Friday afternoon when he came within 50 yards of the bear, far closer than the quarter-mile of separation required by park rules, officials said.

'They show the bear grazing in the willows, not acting aggressive in any form or manner during that period of time,' Anderson said.

Investigators have identified the man but won't release his name until they've notified his family. They said he's a U.S. citizen but declined to release any other information about him.

A Fateful Search: Park officials launched a rescue helicopter around 8 p.m. Friday, or about two-and-one-half hours after the hikers came upon the lone backpack

Eerie Sighting: Rangers saw at least one bear as they hovered above the site in the helicopter. The lone bear reportedly scurried away moments later

Rangers were hoping to recover his 
remains later Saturday after ensuring the scene was safe. Several other 
bears have been seen in the area.

Officials learned of the attack after 
hikers stumbled upon an abandoned backpack along the river about three 
miles from a rest area on Friday afternoon. The hikers also spotted torn
clothing and blood. They immediately hiked back and alerted staff park.

Rangers in a helicopter spotted a 
large male grizzly bear sitting on the hiker's remains, which they 
called a "food cache" in the underbrush about 100 to 150 yards from the 
site of the attack on Friday.

There's no indication that the man's 
death was the result of anything other than a bear attack, investigators
said, adding that it's the first known fatal mauling in the park's 
nearly century-long history.

'Over the years, and especially since 
the 1970s, the park has worked very diligently to minimize the conflict 
between humans and wildlife in the park,' Anderson said.

 'Over the years, and especially since 
the 1970s, the park has worked very diligently to minimize the conflict 
between humans and wildlife in the park.'

'We have some of the most stringent 
human-wildlife conflict regulations in the National Park system, and I 
think those are largely responsible for the fact that there hasn't been a
fatal attack.'

Park officials said they don't believe
other registered backpackers are in the immediate area. That portion of
the park is closed but other wilderness areas remain open, officials 
said.

A wallet was later found near the site of the attack with probable identification. However, officials are yet to name the unfortunate hiker, as they work to identify the next of kin

Prior to receiving a permit to hike in
the area, all backpackers in the park receive mandatory bear awareness 
training that teaches them to stay at least a quarter-mile away from 
bears, and to slowly back away if they find themselves any closer. 
Investigators confirmed that the hiker had received that training.

Denali is located 240 miles north of 
Anchorage, and is famously home to Mt. McKinley. It spans more than 6 
million acres and is home to numerous wild animals, including bears, 
wolves, caribou and moose.

The attack was discovered Friday 
around 5:30 p.m., when a trio of other hikers came upon a lone backpack 
lying along the Tolkat River about three miles from a rest area.

'Upon further investigation, they saw 
evidence of a violent struggle, including torn clothing and blood,' a 
Park Service spokesman told The Anchorage Daily News.

The backpackers alerted park officials, who launched a helicopter around 8 p.m., the Alaskan paper reported.

The helicopter-borne rangers 
discovered the backpack about 30 minutes later, but were forced to 
return empty-handed because of the coming nightfall.

Too-Close-For-Comfort: It was later discovered that the hiker had violated the quarter-mile berth that hikers are mandated to give bears roaming the wilderness

It was discovered later on Saturday that the deceased hiker had photographed his would-be-killer for an astounding eight minutes before the bear attacked
