An investigation has been launched after the bodies of dozens of dogs, cats and rabbits were found dumped in an Italian lake.

Officials suspect the dogs were bred for illegal fights, but other animals had single knife wounds which some suggest may have been inflicted during a bloody mafia initiation ceremony.

There are also fears the dead animals may have been bred for international export to supply labs conducting experiments - in recent years the mafia is said to have made millions from the supply of animals for this reason.

Macabre discovery: Some of the dead animals found next to Frezza lake near Naples, Italy. The horde of corpses is believed to be work of a mafia gang called the Camorra

The latest discovery was made at Frezza lake in countryside near Naples, an area traditionally a stronghold of the local mafia known as the Camorra.

Vets are carrying out postmortem examinations on the animals - some of which were found in plastic bags that had floated to the surface of the lake - at a specialist centre in Naples and prosecutors are waiting for a full report on the macabre discovery.

An initial investigation has revealed that none of the dogs have the compulsory microchip inserted under their skin as Italian law insists which has further fuelled suspicions the animals were bred illegally.

Italian animal defence group AIDAA said they had no doubt that the Camorra was behind the grizzly discovery of the corpses and suggested that some had been killed by 'would-be new Camorra members as a sign of their willingness to kill.'

Convinced: Lorenzo Croce, president of Italian animal defence group AIDAA, claims there is no doubt the Camorra is behind the massacre

President Lorenzo Croce added: 'We know that the Camorra is running dogfights for illegal gambling and holding dogs in what can only be described as canine concentration camps until they are ready to fight.

'Other animals are also being used in international trafficking for vivisection purposes - we believe that this discovery is just the tip of the iceberg and there are many other dumping sites around the region.'

A spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Naples said they were aware of the discovery and investigating the find while waiting for official postmortem results.

According to AIDAA, dog rackets provide the Camorra with annual profits of between six and seven million euros.

Although less well-known than their Sicilian Mafia counterparts, the Camorra have a more blood-thirsty reputation with rival clans happily killing each other for control of lucrative drug cartels.

One of the most infamous massacres was in 2008 when six Africans were gunned down in a hail of bullets in a shop near Naples after they tried to muscle in on a Camorra drug route while already this year there have been three Camorra murders in the city.
