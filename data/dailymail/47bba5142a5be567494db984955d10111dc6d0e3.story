Saudi Arabia has launched airstrikes in Yemen, targeting military installations held by the Shia rebels who swept into the country's south and drove the president to flee by sea.

At least 18 civilians were killed and 24 people injured in the military offensive that started on Thursday, with pictures emerging showing flashing lights and what sounded like machine gun fire.

Saudi-owned Al-Arabiya News reported that the kingdom deployed 100 fighter jets, 150,000 soldiers and other navy units as part of the attack,

An Associated Press reporter on the scene in the Sanaa neighborhood near the international airport saw people searching for loved ones in the debris of flattened homes. 

Residents said at least three bodies were pulled from the rubble. There were traces of blood between the bricks.

Ahmed al-Sumaini said an entire alley close to the airport was wiped out in the strikes overnight. 

Buildings were razed and cars destroyed during the attacks, which killed at least 18 people when bombs fell on Sana'a

Traces of blood were found between the bricks of houses that once stood in Sana'a. Iran has condemned the attacks, saying they considered the air strike 'a dangerous step'

He said people ran out from their homes in the middle of the night. "This was a surprise. I was asleep and I was jolted out of my bed," he said, waving a piece of shrapnel.

In addition to the airport, targets included the camp of U.S.-trained Yemeni special forces, which is controlled by generals loyal to Saleh. 

Yemeni security officials said the targets also included a missile base in Sanaa that was controlled by the Houthis earlier this year. One of the security officials said the strikes also targeted the fuel depot at the base.

Saudi Arabia announced it was leading a military offensive in Yemen with the support of nine other countries after the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, moved on Yemeni President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi's last refuge in the southern city of Aden. 

The Houthis had captured the city's airport and put a $100,000 bounty on Hadi's head.

Hadi was forced to flee the country by boar, and local media reports say he has taken refuge in neighbouring state Oman.

Translated from the Arabic, their name means 'Supporters of God' and members belong to the Zaidi branch of Islam, who operate primarily in Yemen.

The group is named after Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi, who was killed by the Yemeni army after launching an insurgency in 2004.

After members of Houthis took part in the Yemeni Revolution in 2011, the group won control of key territory across the country and by September 2014 had captured parts of the capital Sana'a.

In January they took over the Presidential Palace in Sana'a, before officially taking control of the government in February - dissolving Parliament, deposing President Hadi and announcing its 'Revolutionary Committee' as the new governing authority.

Houthis are believed to be backed by Iran, who have now strongly attacked the Saudi Arabia and their allies in the Gulf for launching air strikes on Houthis strongholds.

Iran 'condemns the airstrikes against Yemen this morning that left some innocent Yemenis wounded and dead and considers this action a dangerous step,' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marzieh Afkham said in a statement. 

The country has denied providing money and training to the Shi'ite Houthi militia in Yemen, as alleged by some Western and Yemeni officials. 

She said military action would complicate and worsen the crisis in Yemen. 

The departure of President Hadi, a close U.S. ally, and the imminent fall of the southern port of Aden pushed Yemen further toward a violent collapse. 

It also threatens to turn the impoverished but strategic country into another proxy battle between the Middle East's Sunni powers and Shiite-led Iran.

Saudi ambassador to the United States Adel al-Jubeir announced the military operation in a news conference in Washington. He said his government had consulted closely with the U.S. and other allies but that the U.S. military was not involved in the operations.

The White House said in a statement late Wednesday that the U.S. was coordinating military and intelligence support with the Saudis but not taking part directly in the strikes.

Regional players are also involved in the military action, with the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain joining Saudi Arabia in a statement published by the Saudi Press Agency. 

It said they would answer a request from Hadi 'to protect Yemen and his dear people from the aggression of the Houthi militias which were and are still a tool in the hands of foreign powers that don't stop meddling with the security and stability of brotherly Yemen.'

A former Army General, Hadi became the President of Yemin in 2012, having previously acted as Vice President and Acting President under All Abdullah Saleh.

Since taking office he took a firm stance against Al Qaida, but was forced into taking a power sharing agreement with the Houthis, after they gained control of the Yemen capital of Sana'a in 2014.

When the Houthis took over the presidential palace in January of this year, Hadi and his Prime Minister Khaled Baheh handed in their resignations and were placed in virtual house arrest.

 Once the Houthis grip of Yemen grew stronger, after they formed an interim government, General Secretary of the United Nations Ban Ki-Moon urged that Hadi be named as President of Yemen again. 

After he left Sana'a for his home of Aden, Hadi used a speech to declare himself President, calling the actions of the Houthis 'unconstitutional'.

But after the rebels advanced on his last refuge, the former President has been forced to flee the country to escape capture - and sparking air strikes from neighbouring Gulf states as they try to reinstate order on the region.

Oman, the sixth member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, didn't sign onto the statement.

Egypt also announced political and military support. 'There is coordination ongoing now with Saudi Arabia and the brotherly gulf countries about preparations to participate with an Egyptian air and naval forces and ground troops if necessary,' it said in a statement carried by the state news agency.

Pakistan, Jordan, Morocco and Sudan were also joining the operation, the Saudi Press Agency reported on Thursday, while a source also said Jordanian air force fighter jets were participating in the coordinate action.

Dr Natasha Underhill, an expert on terrorism in the Middle East at Nottingham Trent University, warned that Yemen now stands on the brink of civil war.

She said 'With the President effectively removed from power and with no clear sign of a return on the horizon, the situation is reaching a boiling point and the power vacuum that has emerged could result in the failure of the state in the coming weeks.

'The fact that Iran is backing the Houthis is key to their success to date. AQAP have staged deadly attacks but more significant has been the emergence of a Yemen affiliate of the Islamic State group. 

'Saudi Arabia's intervention through the use of airstrikes has added fuel to the fire and may in fact lead to increased fighting between President Hadi's forces and the Houthis.

'The fear with the Saudi involvement at this point would be that it may be seen as an act of aggression and could thus trigger further outbreaks of violence in the already troubled region.'

The embattled president fled the country by sea on Wednesday evening after Houthi rebels advanced on the southern port city where he was taking refuge, captured his defence minister and seized the airport.

Reports on Thursday morning suggested that Aden airport had been retaken by forces loyal to Mr Hadi however after heavy fighting. 

Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi was initially smuggled out of Aden just hours after the Shia rebels' own TV station declared the capture of nearby strategic airbase and arrested the country's defence minister.

The air base is only 35 miles from Aden, where Hadi had established a temporary capital since fleeing Yemen's Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa last month.

Just hours after Hadi fled, the rebels who offered a $100,000 bounty for his capture carried out a wave of airstrikes targeting the presidential security forces guarding the palace. 

The advance of the Shiite rebels, empowered by the backing of the ousted Yemeni autocrat Ali Abdullah Saleh and his loyalists, threatens to plunge the Arab world's poorest country into a civil war that could draw in its Gulf neighbors.
