The Victorian Government will be forced to hand over $451 million in compensation to gambling giant Tatts for lost poker machine revenue.

Tatts Group Limited took court action against the government in 2012 - seeking at least $490 million - after it and Tabcorp were stripped of their duopoly of the operation of poker machines outside Melbourne's Crown Casino. Individual clubs and pubs now operate poker machines in the state.

But Tabcorp's bid for an even heftier payout - $686 million - was rejected by the Victorian Supreme Court on Thursday.

The ABC reported the lawyers for Tabcorp said some of the money it had paid for its gambling licence should have been refunded after the John Brumby-led government introduced the reforms in 2008.

Tabcorp argued it had a right to compensation as a law introduced by the government - after the privatisation of the Victorian TAB and listed Tabcorp on the share market in 1994 - guaranteed it a payment when its 18-year licence expired.

But lawyers for the government said awarding new licences in 2008 and 2009 did not trigger a terminal payment provision in the contract with Tabcorp.

On the other hand, Tatts' claim was seeking compensation after the expiration of its gaming operator's licence under an agreement made in 1995.

Legislation introduced by the Victorian Government in 2008 meant individual pubs and clubs now run poker machines

Tatts were the only ones to walk away triumphant and will get $451 million in compensation from the government

'In the context of the clear purpose of the terminal payment provision, the court noted the unfairness of this result, but concluded that the statutory language was too strict to allow the alternative interpretation contended for by Tabcorp,' Justice Hargrave said.

In a statement, Victorian Treasurer Michael O'Brien said the government would appear the Supreme Court ruling

Justice Hargrave said changes to the Gambling Regulation Act made in 2009 did not override Tatts' entitlement to a payout.

He ordered the government to pay the gambling giant $451 million plus interest.

Premier Napthine said today the government would appeal the Tatts decision.

With the state election just five months away, Dr Napthine said the government would not cut spending or raise taxes to cover the cost of the payout.

'We have a budget surplus this year of over $1 billion, so we can absorb this loss and we will not be increasing taxes.

'We will not be cutting services as a result of this.

Tatts and rival Tabcorp lost their duopoly over the operation of poker machines outside of Melbourne's Crown casino in August 2012, following a decision in 2009 by the previous Labor government, with poker machines in Victoria now operated by clubs and pubs.

'The Labor Party ought to apologise to the people of Victoria for their mismanagement of this process," he told Fairfax radio on Friday.
