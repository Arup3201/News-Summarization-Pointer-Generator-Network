She's officially Maxim's hottest woman in the world who we're more accustomed to seeing her in next to nothing but Candice Swanepoel proves she can still ooze glamour and sexiness when she's fully clothed, too.

The Victoria's Secret model has just been unveiled as the new face of Free People - a cool American brand that's just launched in the UK.

South African-born Candice, 25, has helped the fashion range unveil its pre-fall collection.

New look: Victoria's Secret angel Candice Swanepoel embraces a new sense of style in her latest fashion campaign for Free People

Contrary to the model’s typical bombshell style, Candice dons cool, edgy, looks with a touch of tomboy in the new campaign imagery.

The collection is western-inspired and features black leather, heavy fabrics, plaids, and lariat necklaces.

Inside her life: Candice walks us through a day in her life as a top model, drawing parallels to her upbringing as a dairy farmer in the campaign video

The range, which aims to give a darker twist to looks for the coming season, is full of menswear-inspired sweater jackets and embellished and shaggy knits.

As well as the campaign, Candice stars in a short video titled A Day in the Life of Candice Swanepoel.

The video aims to illustrate just how down-to-earth and fun-loving Candice really is, say the brand.

Earlier this week Candice was spotted out and about in her trademark barely-there attire enjoying a little down time
 with her two cute dogs and her Brazilian model boyfriend, Hermann 
Nicoli.

Proving 
that she doesn't need a catwalk to be a traffic stopper, Candice showed 
off her long, toned legs in tiny high-waisted cut-off denim shorts.

Candice 
met Hermann in Paris when she was 17 years old, and the couple have been
 dating ever since which brings them up to seven years.

The
 couple recently enjoyed a beach holiday in Brazil, his homeland, 
soaking up the sunshine and squeezing in some quality time together.

Candice
then jetted off to Paris to attend and work at Paris Mens Fashion Week,
so this downtime in New York City - where the couple currently lives - 
is surely welcome.
