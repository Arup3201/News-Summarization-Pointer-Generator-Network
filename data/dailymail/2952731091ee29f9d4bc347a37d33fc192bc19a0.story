Message: Care Minister Norman Lamb says that some pensioners have a dismal existence and Britain must build a less neglectful society

Neglect by families and neighbours is to blame for elderly people having to endure dismal lives in care homes, the minister in charge of social care has said.

Norman Lamb said older Britons could lead independent lives at home, if only they had more support from relatives.

Instead, many are never visited at home and are ‘pushed’ into care, Mr Lamb said.

The Lib Dem MP’s comments came as Age UK warned it was ‘critical’ that legislation was introduced to improve the lives of older people.

Mr Lamb’s criticism of ‘neglectful’ families was met by an angry response from Labour, which accused the Coalition minister of dismissing the many carers who voluntarily look after loved ones.

The minister urged local authorities to rebuild ‘neighbourly resilience’ to stop old people leading lonely lives, instead of expecting the state to ‘do everything’.

This would also reduce the burden on the state as fewer people would need to be housed in residential care.

Mr Lamb said: ‘We all have a part to play.

‘In this way, we can make the system sustainable, and it can be a more decent society, a less neglectful society than we sometimes experience where we just expect the state to do everything.’

He suggested that more could be done to stop the elderly from going in to homes.

‘The system pushes them there,’ he said. ‘The system does not do enough to help them maintain their independence.’

Mr Lamb added: ‘With the right support and the right community resilience, and a rebuilding of the neighbour support that used to be there, more people could stay in their own homes for longer.’

Britain had ‘lost the extended family because families have become dispersed’, he said.

‘If someone is living on their own never seeing anyone, that is a dismal existence, and it often ends up with it all collapsing and them going into a care home.

‘Give them support, some companionship, and help them maintain activity in mind and body and everyone benefits.’

He suggested that more councils should follow the example of Leeds, where elderly people are given grants so that they can adapt their homes to stay living in them independently.

Liz Kendall, Labour’s spokesman for care and older people said: ‘Britain’s six million unpaid family carers aren’t being neglectful of their loved ones and they don’t expect the state to do everything – far from it.

‘They look after their frail elderly and disabled relatives day in day out, often with precious little help and support.

‘Instead of blaming families for the care crisis, the Government should be facing up to its responsibilities by putting in place a decent and fair system for funding social care now and in future.’

Mr Lamb also confirmed that the Government would announce a cap on care fees, expected to be around £75,000, above which the state will pay.

Warning: The elderly are ending up in care too easily people should be more 'neighbourly' so they can stay in their own homes, Mr Lamb said

However, he warned that the new 
funding agreement was ‘not a panacea’ and ‘does not remove all financial
pressures’ as people would still have to pay for the accommodation 
component of living in a care home.

Currently, anyone with assets of more than £23,500 faces unlimited charges.

Critics warn that with middle-class 
couples facing a total outlay of as much as £200,000, many elderly 
people may still be forced to sell their homes even with the new cap.

Age UK urged the Government to adopt new legislation in order to improve the lives of the elderly.

The campaign group called for a flat basic state pension and for older people in care to be treated with dignity.

The call for action by the Government 
follows a recent report by a commission looking into dignity in care 
which said old people were patronised in care homes and often treated as
a medical condition rather than as a person.

In a statement, Age UK said: ‘We must 
make sure older people are supported to live happy and healthy lives 
through equal access to appropriate prevention, treatment and 
rehabilitation services.

‘We need to work together to ensure that they are supported to meet their aspirations and to live rewarding later lives.’
