In a handwritten note to police scrawled while he was in a desperate bid to get out of jail, Gable Tostee has apologised for drink driving and admits to 'drowning myself with alcohol'.

The one page letter, obtained by Daily Mail  Australia, was penned at Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in a scrappy style with occasional spelling errors and includes an admission by Tostee that 'I have a problem with binge drinking' and that he has put people's lives at risk.

Written on November 11,  exactly a week before he was granted bail on strict conditions including not drinking alcohol, Tostee's note specifically apologises for drinking in the early hours of July 27.

Less than two weeks before the 28-year-old allegedly murdered Warriena Wright, who fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony, police detected Tostee at 3am  on the highway across the NSW border.

'It was a wake up call" : Gable Tostee claims getting caught by police for high range drink driving on July 28 was the 'wake up call I needed ... before something worse happened'. Twelve days later Warriena Wright (pcitured) fell to her death from his 14th floor balcony after a night of serious drinking

'I am dangerous and drowning in alcohol': Gable Tostee's handwritten note, penned in prison, confesses his serious binge drinking problem and the fact he has endangered people's lives while drinking excessively

He was 'travelling at high speed' and when eventually he was stopped, in Queensland, was charged with high range drink driving in an incident Tostee describes in his handwritten note as 'immature and dangerous'.

'I am completely ashamed of myself,' he wrote, 'I ... put the lives of my friends, other road users and yourselves as officers at risk.

'I have disappointed myself and my family who have done their best to raise and support me. Since then I have finally come to accept that I have a problem with binge drinking and I am taking measures ... to deal with my issues in ways that do not involved drowning myself with alcohol.

'Wittier on alcohol': Gable Tostee thinks he is wittier on alcohol but admits he has been binge drinking to ease social anxietties for 11 years since Schoolies

'My foolish and immature attitude has cost me ... being stopped that night was the wake-up call I needed and I am thankful that it happened before something potentially much worse happened.'

Twelve days later, following an alleged drinking session at his Surfers Paradise apartment, 26-year-old New Zealand bank clerk Warriena Wright died at around 2.20am. 

The note is among several court documents filed by Tostee's lawyers to gain freedom on bail while he awaits his murder trial, which is unlikely to proceed before late 2016 to early 2017.

In an affidavit  filed by Tostee in the Queensland Supreme Court, he says he recalls 'being in a state of panic' during the July police pursuit and that 'I 100% accept I screwed up' and had been 'so reckless'.

He also claims he is 'wittier' when drinking alcohol and admits he has been a 'danger to the public' while binge drinking since the age of 17.

Both he and his father, Gray Tostee, admit his extreme alcohol problem began at Schoolies 11 years ago and continued as he tried to cope with his 'social anxieties'.

Now on bail and living at his parents' house at Carrara on the Gold Coast, Tostee says he still intends to 'go out' and has applied for his curfew to be reduced to just six hours, from 10pm to 4am and he only wants to be alcohol tested on Sundays.

In the affidavit he says, 'I have a problem with excessive alcohol consumption.

'I commenced my consumption of alcohol socially on the Gold Coast when I was 17 years of age at Schoolies. I found that it helped me resolve my anxieties in interacting with others by improving my confidence.

'Since that time  I have relied on alcohol to deal with my social anxiety. When I drink alcohol socially I feel at ease with people.

'Without alcohol I am quite reserved and less talkative. I find that I am slow to think and do not feel as witty when I am sober.

A danger to the public: In applying for bail on a charged of allegedly murdering Warrien Wright (pcictured), Gable Tostee has admitted he is a danger to the public while binge drinking and then driving

'When intoxicated I feel wittier, more relatable and confident. I accept that I have a problem with drinking to excess (binge drinking) and that I use alcohol as a crutch'.

In his affidavit, Gray Tostee says it was a shock when he and wife Helene discovered their son had 'consumed alcohol to excess' since the age of 17.

'Gable and I are very close and I love him very much ... unfortunately since the age of about 23 1/2 onwards Gable's social anxieties were largely addressed by him in a destructive fashion with alcohol.

'Gable seemed to get into some difficult situations due to alcohol, and sometimes legal issues arose.'

In his affadavit, Gable Tostee admits he was drunk when he allegedly resisted police during another incident on January  27 after he allegedly refused to pay a tuk tuk driver.

Tostee 'was heavily intoxicated', police told the court, between 2am and 3am on January 27, when he was arrested after allegedly insulting officers.

His lawyers have tendered in evidence a transcript of the CCTV of the incident, in which police allegedly say they are charging him 'for being a d***head'.

Tostee, 28, left prison on a $200,000 surety put up by his parents on November 18, three months after he was arrested for Ms Wright's alleged murder.

His bail conditions include not using the mobile dating app Tinder, and other social media sites including Facebook. 

The US administrators of Tinder are being pushed by Australian authorities to aid their search for more than 50 women from Australia and overseas who were allegedly contacted by Mr Tostee via the app.

Bail documents indicate that investigators are pursuing statements from the women and have requested data from both Mr Tostee and Ms Wright's Tinder accounts, reported The Australian. 

Ms Wright died at around 2.20am, under six hours after meeting Mr Tostee at Cavill Mall in Surfers Paradise via Tinder.

Gold Coast Police Prosecutions legal division sergeant Michael Campbell labelled Mr Tostee's contact with 'persons over the dating site' as 'substantial'.

In an email to Mr Tostee's lawyers tendered as part of the bail proceedings, Sergeant Campbell said that 'Police conducted extensive inquiries in relation to the defendant's' actions on Tinder.

Sergeant Campbell noted that while the majority of witness statements for the case had already been collected, police were still chasing 50 outstanding statements from witnesses interstate and overseas.  

At Tostee's bail hearing last month, prosecutors alleged he locked 26-year-old victim Warriena Wright outside on a 14th floor balcony and that was akin to locking someone in a trunk to suffocate.

Justice  Mullins told the court the case 'is not in any view a straightforward case of murder'.

Granting Tostee bail, Justice Debra Mullins said the strict conditions imposed on him would reduce the risk of him fleeing. 

‘I am satisfied the applicant has shown cause as to why his detention in custody is not justified,’ Justice Mullins said.

Crown prosecutor Ben Power argued there was a strong risk Tostee would flee with the threat of a mandatory 20-year prison sentence looming.

But defence barrister Soraya Ryan argued Tostee's public profile meant he couldn't hide from authorities.   

Mr Tostee denies he murdered Ms Wright. Mr Tostee appointed Mr O'Gorman following the civil libertarian's comments about the release of court documents including an alleged transcript of Ms Wright's night with him, taped on his phone, and a police affidavit of what occurred between the two in the hours before Ms Wright's death. 

The prosecution claimed Tostee has a ‘bizarre indifference to Ms Wright's death’ and that she had been affected on the night of her death by alcohol in the form of a ‘white spirit’ made by him.
