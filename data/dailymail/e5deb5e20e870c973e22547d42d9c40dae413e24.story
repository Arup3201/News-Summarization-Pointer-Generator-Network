Port Vale have sacked defender Daniel Jones after he was involved in a training ground bust-up with captain Doug Loft and ruled out for the rest of the season with a broken cheekbone.

The incident happened on Thursday last week and neither player featured in weekend’s 4-2 defeat at Notts County.

Vale boss Micky Adams says the club will hold an internal investigation.

But the club have already decided to sack 27-year-old Jones who has a year remaining on his contract.

Captain Loft - who suffered a suspected broken cheekbone - is contracted until the end of the season.

Loft's solicitor Paul Dodds said: ‘Doug is genuinely shocked by what has happened to him. He is focusing on obtaining the best treatment so he can get back  playing as quickly as possible.

‘However, given the type of injury, it cannot be ruled out that legal proceedings will follow.’

The defeat to relegation threatened County now means it is unlikely that Vale will make the play-offs as they are 10 points off with four games left to play.

'It's been a poor week for us,' Vale boss Adams told the BBC.

'For legal reasons, there's very little I can say other than on Thursday there was an incident between two players.

'The training ground incident resulted in one of the players, who I might add is an innocent party to this, receiving a facial injury that has consequently ruled him out for the rest of the season.

'It's another negative headline that, for some reason, this club attracts. But it has to be dealt with internally.

'Incidents like we had are disappointing, but they happen.

'The players who have represented the club over the past two years should feel proud. Even in the season when we went into administration, I was proud of everybody's efforts.'
