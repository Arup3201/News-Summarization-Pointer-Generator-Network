The oldest motorboat still afloat in Europe, which was used in the 1908 Olympics, at one time lay neglected in a Thames boatyard for 14 years - but it has now found its sea legs again after a major renovation.

The wooden 'trials boat', which was snapped up for a mere £400 four years ago, has been lovingly restored to its former glory. It now has an estimated value 1,000 times that amount at £400,000.

The 25ft-long vessel, believed to have been built by boatmakers Thornycroft in 1902, was purchased by and restored for transport collector Wint Taylor.

'Fixitor', named by previous owner Michael Hawkins in 1949 after joking to 'fix it or leave it', because it required so much restoration work back then, has a fascinating history.

Built in the early 20th Century, it is one of the oldest motorboats in the world and its current engine means it reaches at speeds of up to 18mph - the same as its heyday.

Amazingly, it is also the only boat to appear in all three royal pageants marking the Queen's coronation, Silver and Diamond Jubilee.

Three commemorative plaques are now screwed to the dashboard to mark this special achievement.

Further evidence confirms it was also used in the 1908 Olympics - the only time power boat racing has ever featured at the event.

During Fixitor's restoration, traces of 'British Racing Green' paint were found underneath the hull - the colour used for the Games.

Mr Taylor, who is an engineer aged in his 60s, said: 'It's the oldest power boat in Europe - there are other boats around, but they're not still afloat.

'It has no flat surfaces on the hull or on the deck and this helps give us the date.

'It also has holes for tow ropes, which is a sign of an Olympic trial boat as these were the only ones which had them.'

Today, 'Fixitor' is fitted with a 1950's MG 1500cc 4 cylinder sports car engine.

Originally, the boat would have had a rather more basic petrol unit used in aircraft, but they were very heavy in comparison to their power output.

The unreliable engine propellers were not replaced until the First World War, when they developed as lighter, efficient engines used in aircraft.

Eventually the technology trickled down to boats.

Rediscovered and restored, the Fixitor was reunited with former owner Ann Hawkins of Farnborough at this year's Henley rally, where it won the People's Choice Award.

Her late husband Michael, who named it Fixitor, bought it in 1949 from an army officer stationed abroad.

Back then the boat had been sitting in a garden in Fleet for at least ten years and was without an engine.

Michael named her Fixitor after an old Navy joke - "fix it or leave it" - because it required so much work.

The couple would cruise on inland waterways and the upper Thames and together they owned her until selling Fixitor in 1995.

It
 then remained in the yard until Classic Restoration Services of Windsor
 bought it in July 2009 at the Traditional Thames Boat Rally for Mr 
Taylor, who lives in West London.

Stephen Messer, a boatbuilder for Classic Restoration Services, spotted the vessel near the company's exhibition tent.

It was not long before he realised the ship's potential.

Clues on board: Wint Taylor knew this was a high-quality boat by looking at the craftmanship and lightweight construction, which are indicative of a racing boat

He said: 'I looked at it and realised it was an interesting hull. I thought "this could be quite special".'

The £400 purchase, from Michael Dennett's boatbuilders yard in Chertsey exhibiting at the rally, has proved a shrewd investment.

According to Mr Taylor, the clues were in the fixings on the mahogany hull planks, which were carefully doubled up, which is a sign of high quality craftmanship.

It also had a lightweight construction, a detail which indicated it is a racing boat.

Mr Messer contacted the Classic Boat Museum on the Isle of Wight, which first identified the hull as a classic state of the art 1900 racing yacht design.

The original seat position and special connection points for tow ropes located on board tied in with the appearance of early racing trials boats.

These were raced in the first-ever British International Harmsworth Trophy in 1903, which pitted wooden powerboats against each other.

It was Thornycroft who built the majority of early wooden racers for trials racing - and Fixitor's build matches those used in the first event.

The distinctive curved 'Art Nouveau' structure of the hull is typical of early English racers used in the event.

Classic Offshore Powerboat club secretary Martin Napier said the curved design for the hull, also known as 'hard chine', was common for early racing boats.

He said: 'Hard chine hulls rise up to 'plane' on the surface of the water, thereby reducing the boat's resistance and increasing its speed.'

The British International Harmsworth Trophy still exists today for modern powerboats, but they now reach speeds of around 100mph.

Mike James, 63, Commodore for the Classic Offshore Powerboat Club, said: 'The boat is absolutely stunning.

'I've never seen anything that old restored to such a beautiful standard.

'It's very typical of the boats from the early 1900s.

'The Americans are fanatical about this sort of boat, but this is one of the best.'

Mr Taylor didn't disclose how much he had spent on the restoration, but says it was worth every penny given its current value.

Mr Messer said: 'I have been quoted by American experts that it could make half a million dollars.'

The figure derives from price comparisons with other wooden motorboats being sold at North American auctions.

According to Mr Messer, the most valuable are those built before the First World War.

Another early powerboat from 1912 is still on the water on the Isle of Wight, but lacks the history of  Fixitor.

And a similar French motorboat from the same era is held at the Maine Maritime Museum in Bath, USA, but no longer floats.

Its condition has deteriorated massively in comparison to the Fixitor, and it no longer sits on the water.

Mr Messer said: 'They described it to me and said it was in deep storage, which I think basically means it is a pile of wood on the floor.'
