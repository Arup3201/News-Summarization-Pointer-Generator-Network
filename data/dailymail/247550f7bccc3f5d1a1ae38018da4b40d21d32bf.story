Burma's Nobel Peace Price laureate and pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi will travel outside her country for the first time in 24 years when she visits Britain later this year.

Suu Kyi, recently elected to the year-old parliament that replaced nearly five decades of oppressive military rule, will visit Oxford where she attended university in the 1970s.

She will also visit Norway during her short European tour in June, it was revealed.

Historic: Her trip to Britain, which will include a visit to Oxford, will be the first time she has left her country in 24 years

The 66-year-old was first detained in 1989 and spent 15 of the next 21 years in detention until her release from house arrest in November 2010.

She refused to leave the country during the brief periods when she was not held by authorities, for fear of not being allowed to return.   

She won one of her party's 43 seats in this month's by-election following a series of reforms under President Thein Sein, a former general.

They included the release of political prisoners, more media freedom, dialogue with ethnic militias and an exchange rate unification seen crucial to fixing the economy.

Considered: At the time of the invite she said the fact that she would consider the offer, rather than reject it outright, showed 'great progress' had been achieved in Myanmar

Suu Kyi was invited to visit Britain when she met Prime Minister David Cameron in Yangon on Friday.

Financial transactions supporting humanitarian and not-for-profit activities will now be easier to make in Burma - after the U.S. softened a series of sanctions against the nation.

Education, sports, religious and democracy-building activities in the country will benefit - as will projects meeting basic human needs.

These include disaster relief, clean water and sanitation.

It comes as the U.S. 'normalises relations' with Burma following recent parliamentary elections and the release of some of its political prisoners.

Earlier this month, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called the elections a 'dramatic demonstration of popular will'.

She said the administration was working toward sending an ambassador to Myanmar.

It also wants to establish an in-country mission for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).

At the time she said the fact that she would consider the offer, rather than reject it outright, showed 'great progress' had been achieved in Myanmar.   

She added: 'Two years ago I would have said thank you for the invitation, but sorry.'   

Cameron's trip capped a week-long trade mission to the Far East. He also held talks with Burmese leader Thein Sein at his sumptuous presidential palace in Naypyidaw.

He told him that Britain would argue for economic sanctions on the country to be gradually lifted - but only if they continue their transition to a democracy.

Suu Kyi's long refusal to leave Myanmar characterised her steely determination to defy the ruling junta.

It had offered to release her from house arrest to be with her late husband, Michael Aris, who died of cancer in Britain in 1999.    

Their story was played out on the big screen late last year in the film The Lady, as she is affectionately known.

Malaysian action Michelle Yeoh played the starring role of Suu Kyi.    

The daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung San visited Myanmar in April 1988 to take care of her dying mother, Khin Kyi, a former ambassador to India an Nepal.    

Her National League for Democracy went on to win by a landslide a 1990 election for a constitution-drafting assembly.

But the military ignored the result, leading to a two-decade political stalemate between the junta and Suu Kyi's opposition.
