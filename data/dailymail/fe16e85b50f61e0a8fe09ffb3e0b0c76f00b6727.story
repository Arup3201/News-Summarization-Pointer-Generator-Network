The Keenan family are living in the wrong era.

From their retro wardrobes to every single room and appliance in their house - they eat, breathe and live the 1950s lifestyle - today. 

The Keenans’ home is decked out with vintage appliances that colour coordinate with the 50s wallpaper.  And then there's the outfits and hair do's.

It's a style that Pixie Keenan, from Sydney, has been embracing for more than 30 years.

‘I dress like this every day and have done so since the age of 15,’ Mrs Keenan told Daily Mail Australia.

Mrs Keenan, 47, dresses in floral vintage dresses, sets her candy-floss hair in curls and finishes the look with white cat’s-eye spectacles.

‘My whole family wears 1950s clothing too and they love it,’ she said.

Her son Gage, 11, would generally wear a pair of jeans, a bisley shirt and converse kicks when he goes out.

‘The bisley shirts were very popular in the 1950s and it’s getting a little harder to find but I’ve got quite a collection.

Her husband Aaron, 37, wears the same and sports an Elvis-like hairstyle complete with sideburns. He’s also the lead singer of a rockabilly band called No Brakes.

'He’ll wear a bisley shirt or a 1950s suit when he performs or something more rockabilly oriented like the country western style shirts.

‘My daughter, Nasya, 22, wears vintage occasionally but she really likes the reproduction clothes. She looks fantastic in a 1950s wiggle skirt – so that’s a high-waisted skirt or a pencil skirt that is well fitted and three-quarter length and she’ll wear a pretty blouse with it.

‘And I prefer the beautiful big skirts so the floral full skirts or even the double or triple skirts. And lots of petticoats, stockings and a good old fashioned bullet bra because it gives you that perfect shape! And I have a fetish for fascinators and hats.'

The 46-year-old was six years old when her obsession with the decade began after her parents took her to see Elvis Presley perform live in Las Vegas.

‘I was very young but I was brought up on Elvis music,’ she said.

‘When I saw this man live, it was literally like seeing God himself because he had such an angelic voice, and to see the person that angelic voice belonged to was quite overwhelming.'

The family kitchen comes complete with utensils, a lemon coloured Sunbeam Mixmaster, a Colda fridge and even an early Kooka gas oven – all in working condition. 

They also own a huge Precedent TV in the lounge room, as well as a rotary-dial telephone in the hallway.

‘The furniture in those days was such good quality and in fact, most of my life purchases that are 60 years old are still in good condition.

‘Things back then were made to last – whereas these days, we are a disposable generation where things only last for a year or so and then you have to throw them out.

‘We’ve also got a 1950s beauty parlour and a magnificent cocktail bar – these are all sentimental items to me and I can tell you when and where I got each and every piece from – they've become part of my family.'

The mother of two also keeps herself busy with her own 50s inspired business - Boogie Bop Dames - where she teaches deportment classes, as well as hair and make-up workshops after she taught herself the authentic styles.

‘I teach ladies how to present themselves, how to hold themselves correctly and how to sit properly,' she said.

‘I just think that people had a lot more respect for other human beings back then and had good old fashion values – where people would walk down the street and greet each other and gentlemen were gentlemen – they opened the car door and pulled back the chair.

‘And that to me that is really important and is something I’m still teaching my children.’

Mrs Keenan also runs her own vintage photo studio where she gives her clients a 50s makeover from head to toe. Her clients range from women of all ages to men or 14-year-old's parties.

‘It’s an experience stepping back in time and the thing is, most woman who come along and are photographed by me lack a lot of self-confidence because they've never done anything special in their life,’ she said.

‘So what I do is I transform them with their hair and make-up so that they can see their true beauty.

‘Whether, it’s tucked down deep inside or whatever it is – most of these women for the very first time wouldn't acknowledge that they’re beautiful.  So I put them in a pretty dress and I pose them so they feel good about themselves.

‘Then when I turn the camera around,  they cannot believe it’s them. In fact, I’ve had a lot of woman cry because they cannot believe the beautiful woman in that photograph is them.' 

Mrs Keenan's daughter, Nasya wears vintage occasionally, dressed in 1950s floral dresses or pencil skirts and beautiful blouses

When the family get together, they dine at an authentic 1950's diner before they head to the Skyline drive-in to watch a movie

 When the family get together, they occasionally visit the local Skyline drive-in and dine at an authentic 1950’s restaurant.

‘There’s nothing better than going to the drive-ins with the family – you go to the diner and you have a chilli dog or hot dog – it’s very American style and you sit in your car and watch the movie with your family – It’s great fun,' she said.

When asked what her favourite collection was, she couldn't decide between her Barbie collection and her swimsuits.

‘My favourite is probably my 1950's private swimsuit collection. I’ve got some really stunning ones and I think they’re just divine and flattering. They’re modest so you’re covering everything that you should be covering and you just feel good and feel like a million dollars when you wear them.'

Mrs Keenan has been living the lifestyle for over 30 years and she's grateful that her family have all shared the same interests and passion

While the lifestyle isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, Pixie is grateful her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does

Mrs Keenan said while their lifestyle isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, she's grateful that her family share the same interests and passion for the era that she does.

'Not everyone is accepting of my lifestyle choices but that's ok - each to their own,' she said.

‘I believe that everybody should be able to do what they want and dress the way they choose in life – providing it doesn’t hurt another human being.

‘There’s nothing wrong with being different – its important to be different, not everybody needs to be the same. There’s nothing wrong with being an individual and sharing your love for whatever it might be.

‘The people who step outside the box and have enough confidence really need to be applauded.'
