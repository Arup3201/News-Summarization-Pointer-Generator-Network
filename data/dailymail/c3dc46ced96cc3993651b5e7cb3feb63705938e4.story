Barry Bowe, 54, was found dead in his home Monday

A principal who described himself as a ‘Renaissance Man’ was found dead in his home Monday night.

Barry Bowe, 54, was fearful that he would be dismissed from his job amid an ongoing investigation from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg school district over a security incident at a school dance in December.

Only days before, parents at Northwest School of the Arts had launched a collective effort for him to be able to keep his post.

The news of his death shocked students of the Charleston, North Carolina school, who said he was genuinely concerned with their educations and futures.

Dr Bowe had requested a personal day Friday, but was supposed to be at work by Monday morning.

A Charlotte-Mecklenburg school employee went to his house to check on him, calling the police after Dr Bowe didn't answer his door.

A neighbour, who was given a spare key, let police into Dr Bowe’s home, where they discovered his body in the garage.

Huntersville Police told WBTV that they believe the principal committed suicide by using carbon monoxide fumes from his car.

An automated phone message was sent out to faculty and students Monday night alerting them of his death.

CMS Interim Superintendent Hugh Hattabaugh said the death of Dr Bowe was a ‘tragic loss.’

He said in a statement Tuesday: ‘Mr Bowe had been at Northwest School of the Arts since 2008 and was cherished by the students, staff and families at the school.’

Around 70 grief counsellors were at the school, assisting students and staff to cope with the tragedy.

According to school officials, Dr Bowe was under investigation for the way he handled an incident at a school dance in last month.

A gun was reportedly found at event, which reportedly only had three faculty members serving as security.

WCNC reports that Dr Bowe was supposed to show up for a meeting with the administration over the December 17 incident.

But he never showed up. That's when CMS workers discovered that he was dead.

One angry parent said the principal was given an ultimatum by the school board: either resign or be fired.

Others were demanding answers about Dr Bowe’s ‘forced resignation, though CMS said the investigation was on-going and no punishment had yet been administered.

Many parents, however, thought the incident was a way to oust Dr Bowe, WBTV reports.

Students painted a large rock outside the school’s campus black in memory of their beloved principal.

Another parent reflected on the positive influence Dr Bowe brought to the school.

‘He was such a wonderful educator and a wonderful man and he did wonders for this school,’ parent Lisa Muller told the station.

One angry parent said the principal was given an ultimatum: either resign or be fired.

In 2010, Dr Bowe wrote on his Facebook page how much he enjoyed his job at the North Carolina school. He said: 'Northwest School of the Arts is the perfect job match for me.

'We have a great photography program as well as theater, dance, music, and all of the visual arts.

'I love my talented "kids." I love that arts an am blessed to have help support good hard working students for many years.'

While the district hasn’t disclosed much information regarding Dr Bowe’s employment, they said that he was not being forced to resign.

Dr Bowe founded an arts festival in West Virginia, and was a ‘perfect fit’ for the West Virginia arts school, one CMS administrator said.

Bowe began teaching in 1979 at East Bank High School in West Virginia. In 2000, he won Principal of the Year award.

His obituary in the Charlotte Observer said: ‘He was a computer geek, a journalist, and he enjoyed working with special needs students. But at heart, he was an artist.’
