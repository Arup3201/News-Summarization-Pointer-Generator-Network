Killed: Armani Kreamer, 12, was killed in a car crash after a friend, 13, went on a joyride

A 12-year-old boy has been killed and three of his young friends have been injured after a 13-year-old girl allegedly took them for a joyride and smashed into a tree at high speed.

Armani Kreamer, 12, was one of the four children in the car as it drove through Olympia Fields in Chicago, Illinois on Wednesday - even though he was supposed to be grounded.

The driver, who has not been named, had taken her mother's car, Kreamer's mother said. Other neighbors told WLS that the girl had previously claimed her mother allowed her to do this.

Authorities believe the girl may have been speeding when she lost control, smashed into a bank and hit a tree at 12.45pm in Brookwood Terrace, NBC Chicago reported.

There are still indents in the grass on the quiet suburban street where she hit the bank.

Kreamer's mother said he was wearing a seatbelt at the time of the crash, but he was pronounced dead at a Chicago Heights hospital at 2.21pm. An autopsy is scheduled for Thursday.

All of the passengers were less than 16 years old and residents of Olympia Fields, police said. The three survivors - the driver, another boy and another girl - were taken to hospital for treatment.

Heartbroken: His mother, Regina Anderson, is searching for answers surrounding her son's death

Kreamer's mother, Regina Anderson, returned to the crash site on Thursday to search for answers.

'What was he saying?' she wondered. 'Did he suffer?'

A neighbor, Terrell Neely, said he was not surprised the girl had driven the car.

'A while ago, she said that her mom let her drive on her birthday when 
it was her birthday a couple months ago, and she said her mom let her 
drive the car around,' he told WLS.

Anapam Razdan, who lives by the crash site, told NBC he was shocked anyone survived.

'There was some movement in the car, and I kept hearing some women or girls screaming and saying, "Oh, let me out, let me out, look at the car," which I thought was kind of strange,' he said.

'I wouldn't think that adults would be driving that fast in a neighborhood like this and it makes more sense that someone was just not very mature.'

Olympia Field Police continue to investigate.
