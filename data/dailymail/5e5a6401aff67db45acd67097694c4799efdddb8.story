An eyewitness at the violent argument between Orlando Bloom and Justin Bieber has said that the 37-year-old actor took a running jump at the pop star before throwing the first punch.

Model Anastasia Skolkova told the Daily Mirror that Orlando, who was dining with Leonardo DiCaprio at the Cipriani restaurant on Wednesday night, was 'very, very angry' when Justin, who didn't have a reservation at the eatery, approached their table to try to talk to the actors.

The Wolf Of Wall Street star DiCaprio had proceeded to shoo away the pop singer with his hand, leading Bieber to provoke a fight which saw Bloom jump over a sofa to get at the 20-year-old Baby singer at the restaurant where Lindsay Lohan and P Diddy were also dining.

The eyewitness, who also took a video of the Bieber and Bloom fight, said: 'He got up and 
started running. Then he jumped over the sofa.'

Justin supposedly became angry when fellow diner Leonardo 'flicked 
him away' with his hand as he approached their table.

'Bieber
 said something to DiCaprio - I don't know exactly what, because it was 
seven or eight metres away. Leo brushed his hands at him, like, I don't 
care what you say. Yeah, he flicked him away.'

Taking a minute before deciding what he 
was going to do, Orlando wasn't going to let anything get in his way as 
he made a beeline for the singer.

'When everyone thought 
everything was quiet, they tried to fight again. Both tried to throw 
punches,' she continued telling the Daily Mirror.

Anastasia, who was quick to share her video of the 
fight on Twitter and Facebook, says that the actor was being cheered on 
by his A-list pals, including Dicaprio, when the fight broke out.

She remembers the Baby singer provoking the first punch.

Anastasia,
 who had been sitting near to Orlando's table where he dined with Dicaprio and a large group of friends, filmed Bieber allegedly 
yelling, 'What’s up, b***?' to Bloom in the video.

She
 added: 'When Orlando punched Bieber, everyone 
started clapping. Lindsay was laughing. It was amazing. The whole table 
he and DiCaprio were on were clapping. Afterwards, I don't know if 
people were congratulating Orlando or trying to calm him down.

'When
 security saw that when they got separated, Bieber and Orlando tried to 
punch each other again, security were like, 'Bieber came, Bieber 
provoked this fight', so they took his hands behind his back and took 
him away from the restaurant.'

Both men were clearly riled up and while Lohan intervened to calm the Baby singer outside when the fight spilled out onto the street, the Lord Of The Rings actor left after failing to settle down.

She said: 'There were actually two moments when it turned violent, it wasn't just the one punch thrown.'

The two men met by chance at the Spanish eatery, but appear to have a common connection in Orlando's estranged wife Miranda Kerr.

One 
version of the event hears that 20-year-old Bieber told Orlando he had slept with 
Miranda, whom he first met at a Victoria's Secret show in 2012, to prompt him 
to hit the singer.

Justin told Orlando to 'Say hi to Miranda for me!' just moments after the actor tried to punch him, one onlooker told MailOnline.

The New York Post reported on Thursday that Bloom 'never looked at her [Miranda] the same', after rumours of a hook-up between her and Bieber at the 2012 Victoria's Secret show in New York (a year before the couple announced their marital break-up).

Representatives for Bloom and Bieber have refused to comment on the restaurant fight, despite the in-depth eye witness accounts.

Meanwhile, Bieber has continued to provoke the English actor by posting a picture of his former wife Miranda in a bikini with a crown symbol caption, followed by a picture of Orlando Bloom wiping his eyes as if to cry.

Miranda on the other hand, has used Instagram to prove that she's not getting involved.

Posting a series of model shots from recent campaigns and a sweet mother-son picture with the couple's little boy Flynn Bloom, the former Mrs Bloom can be seen to turn her back on the whole situation.
