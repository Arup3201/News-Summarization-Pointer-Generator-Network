Wimbledon mixed doubles champion and Jamie Murray talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who he would like to play him in a movie about his life.

Who is your sporting hero?

As kids we were taken to Hibernian every week and my favourite player was winger Michael O’Neill, who is now manager of Northern Ireland.

What would you be if you weren’t a tennis player?

I’d love to have been a golfer, I was quite promising once. I was close to going to an American university, but am not sure what I would have studied there.

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

Usain Bolt, he seems to be someone who enjoys both his sport and his life, making the most of it.

Career highlight?

Winning the mixed doubles title at Wimbledon in 2007. I also played in Tim Henman’s last ever match as his partner, in the doubles of a Davis Cup match against Croatia, which was pretty special.

. . . And the worst moment?

Losing in the Australian Open doubles of 2012. I didn’t have a regular partner and was at a very low ebb. I couldn’t face the thought of going through the year with nobody regular to play with.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

Apart from my wife it would probably be my wallet and passport, that’s not very exciting but they’re difficult to replace.

What are the most-listened to songs on your ipod?

Waves by Mr Probz plus anything by Ed Sheeran.

Murray also revealed himself to be a big fan of singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran

Last film you saw?

I usually catch up with films when I’m on planes. The last was The Railway Man with Colin Firth (below), it was excellent.

Last book you read?

I read a lot of sports biographies, especially football. Recent ones include Paul Merson and Keith Gillespie. The gambling theme is a coincidence!

Three people you’d invite to dinner?

Michael Jackson, Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane. I’d love the last two together.

Favourite pre-match meal?

Something light. Fish, rice and vegetables.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I can do some chocolatey things, like cake and cookies. I made my wife some cookies for her birthday.

Your favourite holiday destination?

Bali, and I’ve just been lucky enough to go to Necker Island to play tennis with Richard Branson.

Murray also revealed he would love to have Sir Alex Ferguson and Roy Keane round for dinner

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

Maybe Leonardo di Caprio. Do you think I look a bit like Colin Firth?

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

My wife’s engagement ring, or the holiday in Bali.

Tell us a secret . . .

Andy I were big wrestling fans. We used to make wrestling championship belts out of cardboard and fight for them.

Jamie Murray will join John McEnroe, Tim Henman and Andy Roddick for the Statoil Masters at the Royal Albert Hall December 3-7. www.statoilmasterstennis.com
