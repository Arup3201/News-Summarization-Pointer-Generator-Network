A Bartlesville, Oklahoma mother has been charged with child neglect for allowing an unlicensed tattoo artist give her 10-year-old daughter a tattoo with ink containing human ashes.

The mother, 31-year-old Jennifer Wilson, was arrested in her home early Thursday morning in an unrelated Drug Task Force raid.

Wilson's husband Amos Wilson, 33, and one other were arrested for allegedly manufacturing methamphetamine.

Authorities were tipped off about the possible child neglect charges by a counselor at Jane Phillips Elementary School who noticed the 10-year-old girl's new tattoo on the left side of her body.

The unlicensed tattoo artist, 31-year-old Brandon Brown, has been charged with unlawful tattooing and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.

When interviewed by police, Brown admitted that he didn't have a license but said he was 'very clean' and that he didn't expose his customers to health hazards.

But according to police Sgt Elizabeth Mitchell, a search of Brown's equipment found that 'there were live and dead baby roaches present, along with roach feces on the open box of disposable gloves'.

Brown also gave tattoos to the mother and her husband on the same day. The ink used for the tattoos was mixed with human ashes - a practice usually used to memorialize a deceased loved one.

While the practice has become popular in recent years, it has been criticized for it's health consequences. The body can sometimes reject the ashes, causing infections and scarring.
