A father who almost died trying to save his son after he fell ten feet down a manhole filled with sewage is outraged the city has not taken steps to ensure it doesn't happen again.

Bob Anderson, from Albuquerque, is demanding the city make the necessary changes after his five-year-old son fell down the manhole in the middle of a construction zone a week ago.

He said it was dark when he and his family were walking along the street and they did not see that the metal sheets covering it had been removed.

Danger: Bob Anderson said he and his son could have died had his wife not bee there to pull them to safety

Manhole: Both Mr Anderson and his son, five, were stuck in the hole with sewage filling their mouths

Bob Anderson told KOB.com: 'We could have lost him out here. We could have lost me, could have lost him because there
is no way out of these things.'

He said his son was running ahead of him and his wife when he suddenly plunged down the hole.

His immediate reaction was to jump in after his son to rescue him.

Sewage filled both of their mouths as they began to go under. It was only when they bobbed back up that Mr Anderson's wife was able to grab her son and pull him to safety.

She then helped her husband out of the hole. Both of them could have died.

But city officials said the manhole covers at the Lead Improvement Project would not change despite the obvious danger.

No change: When he went back to check a week later, he was shocked to find the same metal sheets covering the hole and nothing else

Spokesman Mark Motsko said: 'We really want to take some time and thank the family and the father for being brave enough for going in after his little boy

Measures: The city said they cannot place anything heavier there as it would be more hazardous but have increased patrol

Mr Anderson said he has been feeling sick ever since and has had to visit the emergency room on several occasions due to bacteria

He has also been back to check if the city has made any changes after he alerted them to the danger.

But he was shocked to find the same sheets of steel just sitting on top of the holes.

He said: 'They’re (the city) trying to blame the people for their sloppiness and their job here. I‘m afraid somebody’s going to get hurt before this is all over.'

Albuquerque Department of Municipal Development spokesman Mark Motsko said: 'We really want to take some time and thank the family and the father for being brave enough for going in after his little boy and saving him, because this could have been a horrible story.'

But he said there is still nothing they can do about the hole as anything heavier placed there would be a hazard to get off if there was an accident. They have instead increased patrol in the area.

'We've added an inspector all weekend from now until the project is complete to go up and down twice a day on the weekends to make sure that the covers are in place and that the barrels are also in place,' Mr Motsko told KOB.com.
