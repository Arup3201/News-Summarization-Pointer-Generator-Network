Jailed: Adrian Udrea, 39, pleaded guilty to rape and stealing jewellery from his vulnerable victim

A Romanian-born rapist who broke into the home of an 81-year-old woman and attacked her in her bed was jailed today for 16 years.

Adrian Udrea, 39, pleaded guilty to rape and stealing jewellery from his vulnerable victim from her sheltered accommodation near Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Police were called to her home on September 28 at about 2am after the woman reported the incident. Udrea, of Felixstowe, was arrested two days later and jailed at Ipswich Crown Court.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Smith said: ‘For an elderly lady to be subjected to such a horrific, degrading and vile act in her own home is beyond all comprehension.

‘We cannot praise the victim enough for the bravery and determination she has shown in such terrible circumstances.

‘Her actions in immediately reporting this abhorrent crime and the invaluable assistance she gave the enquiry team helped us to identify and arrest Udrea quickly.’

Michelle Brown, of the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ‘Adrian Udrea was responsible for a particularly brutal and abhorrent attack on an elderly and vulnerable victim.

‘We all like to think we are safe in our own homes and so it was terrifying for this woman to wake up in her sheltered accommodation to find she was being raped by an intruder who also stole her jewellery and other possessions.’

The victim's family said they were 'pleased with today’s sentence and just hope that we can come now come to terms with what has happened and have some kind of peace in the future'.

Udrea was sentenced to 16 years for rape and four years for the burglary, to run concurrently. He denied a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm and that was left on file.
