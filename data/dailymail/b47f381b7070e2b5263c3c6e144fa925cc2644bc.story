A skip-hire employee and a notorious joker literally had the last laugh - making his final journey on one of his old work trucks.

Friends of Brian Burnham, 54, made sure to remember him in the way he would have wanted - with a floral wreath proclaiming his catchphrase: 'Bollocks'.

Mr Burnham was one of three people killed in two separate car crashes on November 4 on the A417 near Gloucester, which locals say is a death trap.

Joker: The funeral of Brian Burnham, 54, at Cheltenham Crematorium. He was one of three people killed on the same day on the A417 near Gloucester. The road, a key route through the Cotswolds, is notorious

Tragic: The circumstances of Brian Burnham's death were upsetting, but mourners managed a respectful joke

The second crash killed pensioners Francis Verity, 91, and Valerie Fitzgerald, 84, both from Wiltshire.

Dubbed the darkest day in the A417's recent history, the triple tragedy prompted a new round of calls for the key route through the Cotswolds to be made safer.

Mr Burnham, from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, died when his Ford Focus was involved in a head-on collision with a lorry.

He had worked for several years at Gloucester building and skip hire firm Smith's, where staff dedicated one of their skip lorries to bear Mr Burnham's coffin to Cheltenham Crematorium.

The floral wreath was thought to be a reference to his favourite catchphrase for when things went wrong.

Mr Burnham, a well-loved joker, had worked at Gloucester construction firm Smith's for several years

Friends and family flooded Facebook with tributes to Mr Burnham, who was known affectionately as Chuffer.

Fran Giles posted: 'We used to be neighbours had some laughs, so sad. RIP Chuffer thinking of you, Marie and family xx.'

Kim Cresswell added: 'RIP Chuffer you will be sadly missed by a lot of people.'

Sharon Clements said: 'Canâ€™t believe another good one taken. RIP Chuffer so many good memories.'

An inquest into Mr Burnham's death has been opened and adjourned.
