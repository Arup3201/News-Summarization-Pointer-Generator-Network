Ian Semmons, 65, was forced to spend nine hours in a 'cupboard' at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital because of a bed crisis 

A pensioner was forced to spend all night in a storeroom at one of the country's flagship hospitals because all the wards were full.

Ian Semmons, 65, was stunned when a porter told him he was being taken to a 'cupboard' at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital.

Having arrived with a serious infection, he claims he was repeatedly disturbed by staff going into the cramped room to get bandages, dressings and other kit.

He said his ordeal was made worse when he had to endure 27 hours nil by mouth before he was taken to theatre for urgent surgery.

Mr Semmons, who set up the national charity Action on Pain 16 years ago, said: 'This just isn't good enough. I'd be embarrassed if I was in charge of this hospital.'

His claims come just days after the Norfolk and Norwich hosptial's chief executive, Anna Dugdale, admitted she would not want her mother treated there as staff are stretched to breaking point.

A&E admissions at the hospital are almost 10 per cent higher this year compared to the same period last year, having shot up to 68,000 this year. 

The 953-bed hospital opened in 2001 under the PFI scheme, costing £229m. It is one of the largest hospitals in the UK in terms of in-patient capacity.

Ms Dugdale admitted that drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions.

He said: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either.

'I would want her in the hospital. It's really tough for everybody.

'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad.

'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.' 

Mr Semmons, of Shipdham, near Dereham, Norfolk, said he now plans to complain to the healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, about his ordeal. 

He had gone to the hospital on July 2 for a routine procedure, which was carried out as an outpatient appointment.

But a few days later, he began feeling unwell and on the weekend of July 12 and 13, he was referred by a GP to the hospital with a high temperature.

He claims he spent four hours in the acute medical unit before being seen by a doctor, who set he had a serious infection and needed to be admitted.

'At 2.30am a porter came through and said we were going to Cringleford ward and he said I was going in the cupboard.'

In total, he spent five days at the hospital before being discharged.

Mr Semmons said: 'They called it a treatment room, but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights

He said: 'The treatment was fabulous, but this incident shows that things are going wrong.

'The nurses on the ward were superb, but they were placed in an impossible situation.'  

The father-of-two said he was taken to the storeroom in a ward at about 2.30am on July 14.

Mr Semmons claims he was forced to stay there until a bed on the ward finally became free at about 11am.

He said: 'They called it a treatment room, but it served as a storage area and the room had no windows and only had bright lights.

'There was no privacy at all. The nurses were coming in quite often and were very apologetic,' he said.

'They had to move my bed at times to get to the supplies. The fact they gave me a complaints form when I arrived on the ward shows the situation is totally out of control.'

A hospital spokesman said treatment rooms were used for extra bed space as 'escalation areas' when hospital wards were full.

The hospital's chief executive, Anna Dugdale, recently admitted she wouldn't want her own mother treated there 

Late last month, Anna Dugdale, chief executive of  Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital spoke out as services reached breaking point due to a catastrophic rise in patients. 

Ms Dugdale said drastic bed shortages at the 13-year-old hospital had forced staff to use makeshift wards in a desperate bid to cope with a flood of admissions.

The crisis is getting worse all the time because the rural region has a growing, ageing population and patients are staying in hospital longer.

Coupled with a rise in A&E admissions - which have rocketed from 54,000 in 2008-09 to 68,000 this year - exhausted staff are said to be under immense pressure.

Ms Dugdale, hospital chief executive since 2008, admitted: 'I wouldn't choose this for my mum, but I wouldn't want her in the car park either. I would want her in the hospital.

'It's really tough for everybody. I do this job as I'm proud of what we do and I love it.

'We are not able to do everything we would like to do for every patient at the moment and that makes me very sad.

'Our ability to accommodate all our patients depends on how many people turn up and how many people we can get out of the back doors.'

Ms Dugdale said there were 'all sorts of options' but insisted that she would never turn patients away from her 953-bed hospital.

The huge level of demand for care has forced the use of non-ward areas for bed space - including makeshift wards in the medical school. 

The dialysis unit and clinical teaching spaces are also used when the hospital is full to capacity. 

In 2010, pensioner Rhoda Talbot, 85, had to spend a night in a storeroom at the Norfolk and Norwich.

Mr Semmons added: 'This [shows this] has been going on for four and a half years.

'I'd have thought they'd have come up with a solution in that period of time.

'To put the blame entirely on outside factors is disingenuous and there is a lot you can do at the hospital,' insisted Mr Semmons.

'Four and a half years and they are still content to put someone in a cupboard or what they call a treatment room.

'It is totally unacceptable and it is quite ridiculous.'

The spokesman said: 'At the time that Mr Semmons came to hospital we were already fully occupied caring for other patients.

'We do not, however, turn away patients who need emergency admission.

'If necessary, when all our wards are full and more patients need our care, we implement an escalation plan and care for patients in what are known as escalation areas.

A&E admissions at the hospital are almost 10 per cent higher this year compared to the same period last year, having shot up to 68,000 this year

'These are areas of the hospital that are not routinely used to accommodate patients but they allow us to safely care for all the patients needing our services.

'Mr Semmons was moved to a treatment room for a few hours on Cringleford Ward until we could provide a single bedded room on that ward.

'He had access to a call bell and the nursing team were making regular checks on his welfare.'

He added: 'Our matron apologised to Mr Semmons at the time of his admission and we have met him since to explain the circumstances.

'We are sorry that he remains unhappy. The hospital is extremely busy, with many elderly patients requiring our care.

'Our staff are working extremely hard to provide all our patients with the care, dignity and compassion that they deserve.

'We are working with our partners across the healthcare system to try to find additional capacity, particularly to enable us to discharge some of those patients who no longer need the specialist facilities of the hospital.'
