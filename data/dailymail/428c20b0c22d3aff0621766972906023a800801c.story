Britain will send 1,000 troops to lead a new 4,000-strong Nato 'spearhead' force headquartered in eastern Europe, it was confirmed today.

David Cameron said the new multinational brigade based in Poland would ‘reassure’ eastern European allies that the threat from Russia was being taken seriously.

The Prime Minister said the ‘reformed Nato response force’ would allow more exercises and ‘if necessary, rapid reinforcement’ if there was an invasion.

He accused Russia of ‘ripping up the rule book’ with its military invasion of parts of eastern Ukraine.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Our great alliance must now evolve and refocus on the new capabilities that we need to keep our people safe.

‘As Russia tramples illegally over Ukraine, we must reassure our eastern European members that we will always uphold our article five commitments to collective self-defence.’

Mr Cameron told other Nato leaders: ‘We must be able to act more swiftly. I hope that today we can agree a multinational spearhead force deployable anywhere in the world in just two to five days.’

Government sources said the unit would be able to deploy a ‘spearhead group’ within 48 hours to reinforce the Baltic states in the event of a Russian invasion, followed by reinforcements.

But Nato officials said it could also be used anywhere else in the world.

The new force is aimed at meeting criticism that Nato is too slow and unwieldy and increasingly irrelevant in the modern world. Nato hopes the main components of the new force will be in place by the end of the year.

Cameron, speaking at the start of the Friday session alongside Barack Obama and other leaders, said Nato ‘must increase [its] capacity’.

The 1,000-strong British contribution is to try to speed up the formation of the rapid-reaction force, which will be staffed on a rotational basis with troops from other Nato countries.

Mr Cameron also revealed 3,500 troops would be engaged in exercises in the Baltics and elsewhere in eastern Europe in a show of strength.

Nato has a 1997 treaty with Russia that forbids permanent bases in the Baltic states. It is getting round this by holding permanent exercises in a bid to reassure the Baltic governments.

Air bases in the Baltics are being modernised and heavy equipment being put in place in readiness.

Unlike Ukraine, the Baltic states are members of Nato and any action against them would draw in other member states.

The Nato secretary-general Anders Fogh Rasmussen said: ‘Nato remains ready for the defence of all allies against any threat. We have to ensure we have the right forces and the right equipment in place for as long as required …. Nato always rises to every challenge, we stand ready to act together.’
