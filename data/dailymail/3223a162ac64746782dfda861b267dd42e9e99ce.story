A promo for the forthcoming gotta-see-it to believe it Fox reality show I Wanna Marry Harry has been released and the verdict is in.

These American ladies really do seem to believe they have the chance to vie for the hand of the prince of Wales.

Helping keep them duped is the convincing, at least from afar, Harry lookalike as well as producer Ryan Seacrest and some of the same devious minds that brought the world the similar hit Joe Millionaire.

I Wanna Marry Harry: The new Fox reality show, created by Zig Zag Productions in the UK and produced by Ryan Seacrest, airs on May 20

'I really hope I have what it takes to pull it off,' says Hicks, 20, who will be holed up at a sprawling English estate with 12 gullible women.

The promo shows Hicks shooting his best cheeky-yet-royal smile as the women do everything they can to get close to him.

'That's Prince Harry,' deadpans a brunette beauty as Hicks is unloaded from a 'royal helicopter' and approaches Berkshire, England's Englefield House.

The 'prince' appears forever flanked by seriously looking 'body guards.'

'His security is not for show,' says another contestant. 'It's real.'

Is it possible? The show takes place in an English countryside estate and follows 12 American women who have no idea the so-called Harry is just a regular guy made up to look like the royal

Ready to win: The women all have their own unique and ravishing look. What they have in common? They all believe the actual Prince of Wales could fall for them. Show above are nine of the 12 contestants

Fairy tale: The women think they're competing for a dream wedding

Hicks will keep up the prince charade for the entire show, and only break the news about his real identity at the very end.

'Will
 he be able to convince them he's regal, and if he does, will they fall 
for the crown or fall in love with the real him?' the show's tagline 
reads.

The show is 
being produced by Ryan Seacrest and ZigZag Productions and was put into 
development last August under the secret title Dream Date.

I Wanna Marry "Harry" will debut on May 20 at 8pm EST on Fox.

Real mansion: The prince may be fake but the drama unfolds at a real English estate in Berkshire called Englefield House

High drama: Like the mansion, the drama and emotion are also real. But Hicks doesn't reveal his true identity to his eager courtesans until the very end

High romance: All's fair in the war of love, even if their Prince Charming is just a commoner with very light eyebrows

Flirtatious: A romantic journey down the River Thames with a prince...or is Tames? Tims?

The competition: Do these women think they have what it takes to steal the real prince (right) away from comely Cressida (left)? It looks like they just might

The show is in the same vein as Joe Millionaire, another dating reality show that aired in 2003.

On
 Joe Millionaire, the women were convinced that they were competing to 
marry Evan Marriott, the heir to a million-dollar fortune. At the end of
 the series, the last two women were informed that Marriott was not a 
rich man, but just a working-class construction worker.

The
 woman who decided to stay with Marriott once his secret was spilled was
 rewarded with a surprise $1 million dollars, and though the pair didn't
 last they did split the prize money.

Joe
 Millionaire was thought up by Fox producer Mike Darnell, who also 
ordered 'Harry' before leaving the network in May. The show will now be 
tun by British-born Simon Andreae.

Role of a lifetime: The actor playing Harry wasn't even convinced he had what it took to deceive the women, but the props alone were pretty convincing

Is that a fake paparazzo? The promo promises viewers won't believe the lengths to which producers were willing to go to convince the women their opportunity was real

Frightened: The show gave the fake prince a fake security detail to whisk away fake photographers who managed to infiltrate perimeter security as startled contestants looked on
