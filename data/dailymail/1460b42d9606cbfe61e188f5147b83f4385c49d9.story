A camera assistant was killed on a film set today, when a freight train unexpectedly arrived on the Georgia tracks the crew were working on.

Four other crew members, who were working on the film Midnight Rider, were seriously injured as the train collided with their set.

The crew, and director Randall Miller, had been filming a dream sequence on a railroad, when the train suddenly appeared on the bridge they were on.

Miller, who reportedly fell on the tracks as the crew tried to get out of the train's path, is working on a film about the life of musician Gregg Allman.

His crew had been prepared for two trains to pass by as they filmed at about 4pm on Thursday. They had placed a bed on a bridge in Doctortown when a train driver blew his whistle to alert them to an unexpected third train.

The team had less than a minute to try to clear the track and get off the bridge before the train, which was heading to Savannah, passed by, Variety reported.

A photographer pulled Miller to safety after the director fell on the tracks while trying to move the bed.

The rest of the eight-man crew were still leaving the bridge as the train went past, striking and killing the second camera assistant, and throwing debris from the set into the air.

Wayne County Detective Joe Gardner told WSAV3 that eight members of a 20-person crew from Meddin Studios, were involved in the incident.

In a statement, train company CSX said it had been 'deeply saddened by a tragedy'. 

It added: 'Initial reports indicate that at least 
three people were injured, one fatally.  CSX personnel are working with 
first responders to meet the needs of those injured.'

The production company has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Production of the film about the Allman Brothers' frontman had only begun this month. The film is due to star William Hurt and Tyson Ritter as Allman in different stages of his life.
