Abuse: Nick Knowles and his wife Jessica Rose, pictured at the Chelsea Flower Show, have received an online backlash after announcing he won;t be present at the birth of their first child

It is a deeply personal decision for any couple – but the revelation that Nick Knowles will not attend the birth of his child has sparked a very public debate.

The television presenter, who already has three children, has admitted he will not be present when his first child with wife Jessica is born in August.

Knowles attended the births of two of his children, but confessed to feeling ‘useless’ on both occasions.

And Mrs Knowles, 26, said she would prefer her 51-year-old husband not to see her in such a ‘vulnerable state’ adding: ‘Giving birth is a very physical process. I prefer a bit of smoke and mirrors.’

But yesterday, she was said to be in tears over the online backlash against her comments, with messages on internet sites calling her ‘selfish’ and ‘immature’.

Critics accused her of ‘banning’ her husband from being by her side, with one writing: ‘What a selfish woman she is not wanting to share this most joyous moment with the baby’s father. I’m not sure she is ready to be a mum, sounds far too immature. I think she will regret it when she grows up.’

Another wrote: ‘In this day and age I feel that it’s a bit selfish to exclude a father from seeing his child come into the world.’

A third said: ‘It takes two to tango and to make a baby, therefore the father should be just as much a part of the birth as he is the conception.’

The backlash follows a magazine interview in which the couple announced the pregnancy. In it, the quiz show star admitted he would not witness his son’s birth in August, despite being present when ex-wife Gillian gave birth to his two oldest children – Charles, 20, and Tuesday, 19. He also has another son by a former lover.

The DIY SOS star has now defended his wife, stressing they reached a joint decision by ‘speaking honestly and listening to each other’.

He said: ‘The rabid and abusive trolling on social media of my wife over the decision by us both that I not be in the room at the forthcoming birth of our child (I will be right outside) … left her in tears.

‘I think it is a mark of how brainwashed we are on the subject that people, and women in particular, can be so abusive to her on a choice that is ours and ours alone.’

In the interview in this week’s Hello! magazine, the couple, who married in 2012, discussed their plans for a water birth where Mrs Knowles would be accompanied by a friend who was ‘not too emotionally involved’.

And Mr Knowles said: ‘There’s a huge amount of guilt, fear and worry on a man’s behalf when their partner gives birth, along with a feeling of complete uselessness, so I’m more than happy to take Jess’s lead on this.’
