A driver has been arrested after a woman who was walking along the M25 at 3am this morning was struck by a car and killed.

The woman, in her thirties, died after she was hit by a black Volkswagen Golf as she walked along the motorway close to the Junction 13 slip road, near Staines, at 2.50am.

A male driver has been arrested on suspicion of drink-driving and failing to stop.

Paramedics were quickly on the scene but the woman, who has not been named, was pronounced dead. Next of kin are yet to be informed.

Police believe the driver failed to stop after the incident but was found further down the road by officers, who arrested him after he failed a breath test. 

He is being held in custody and will be interviewed later today. 

Surrey Police said it was not clear at this point why the woman was walking down the motorway.

A police spokesman confirmed that the woman was local to the area and had not driven herself to the motorway.

'It doesn't appear that she's been hit by multiple vehicles, it's appears it was just the one.

'We're trying to establish whether she has walked there or whether she's been dropped off there and that is what the inquiry is focused on - what she was doing there.'

The spokesman added that the force received two 999 calls from concerned members of the public in the minutes before the woman was hit.

The M25 was closed anti-clockwise from Junction 14 at Heathrow Airport to Junction 12 near Chertsey, Surrey, for more than nine hours this morning, but has re-opened.

Paramedics from both South East Coast and London Ambulance services were at the scene earlier this morning.

A Highways Agency spokeswoman said the incident had not caused 'substantial disruption', but this could change as the morning goes on. Drivers are being diverted via the M3.

A South East Coast Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'At 3am this morning we received reports that a pedestrian had been hit by a vehicle on the M25 near Junction 17.

'The incident was attended by an ambulance supported by a response car. Unfortunately the woman was pronounced dead at the scene.

'There were no other reports of injuries.' 

As police were dealing with the incident, a second collision involving a white minibus, a black Range Rover, a silver Vauxhall Meriva and a bronze Honda CRV, took place. 

The driver of the minibus, who was the sole occupant of the vehicle, was taken to St George's Hospital in Tooting with a serious leg injury and is expected to undergo surgery later today. 

The driver of the Range Rover was taken to St Peter's Hospital in Chertsey with a suspected neck injury. 

The occupants of the other vehicles involved escaped uninjured but were treated at the scene for shock.

Detectives have appealed for witnesses to contact the Collison Investigation Unit on on 01483 632290.
