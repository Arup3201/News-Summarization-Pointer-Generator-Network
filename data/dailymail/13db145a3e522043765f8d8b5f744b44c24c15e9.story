A former professional boxer was part of a gang jailed for 77 years today for smuggling £11million of cocaine into the UK with the help of corrupt British Airways workers.

Stephen O’Meara, 31, formerly of Datchet, Buckinghamshire was today locked up for 13 years for conspiracy to supply cocaine in February and August 2013.

The drugs were transported in two loads and flown on British Airways flights to Heathrow Airport, Southwark Crown Court heard.

In total, police intercepted 40 kilos of cocaine with purity levels of more than 90% and a street level value of £11 million, together with 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition.

Gang leader Harvinder Sanghera, 33, of Heston, Hounslow, London was caged for 30 years for importing cocaine and ammunition, while his ‘right hand man’ Savdeep Atkar, 33, of Grays, Essex was sentenced to 21 years for importing cocaine.

Former boxer and personal trainer O’Meara was handed a 13-year sentence, as was David Brown, 51, of Biggleswade, Bedfordshire for supplying cocaine.

Mark Graffius, defending O’Meara, said the former professional boxer met Sanghera while acting as his personal trainer.

Sanghera and Aktar would watch O’Meara as he took part in sparring sessions, the court was told.

Father-of-two O’Meara was a ‘gifted and dedicated’ boxer boxer who was ‘literally on the very cusp of becoming a top level international,’ according to Mr Graffius. 

He was managed by leading boxing promoter Frank Warren and had planned to move abroad to Spain where he was on the threshold of a ‘major, life-changing event.’

Sanghera was described as a ‘family man’ with two small children, who accrued a number of large debts through gambling.

It was said Sanghera, who previously worked on a perfume production line in Acton, joined the drug conspiracy because he ‘owed debts to people you shouldn’t owe debts'.

Aktar was described as a man brought up by a ‘hard-working’ and ‘god-fearing’ family. Brown was said to be a person who ‘tends to say yes to people.’

Sentencing the men, Judge Robbins said: ‘You four in your own different ways played your parts in ensuring that some very large quantities of cocaine were imported into this country.

‘You know very well the devastating effects these drugs may have on poor individuals.

‘The wholesale value of 40 kilogrammes of cocaine would have been more than £2m, but the street value much higher.

‘This was a sophisticated, well organised, and determined criminal network.

‘Those towards the top end of the organisation, Atkar and Sanghera, were capable of masterminding and resourcing such an operation.’

Judge Robbins said he agreed that the two disrupted importations were indicative of a much larger operation.

He added that Sanghera was ‘closely associated’ with the producers of the drug in Mexico, and had made numerous trips to North America to meet them.

Judge Robbins described Atkar as Sanghera’s ‘right-hand man’ and ‘lieutenant,’ who had encouraged British Airways employees to abuse their positions of trust.

‘The smuggling of firearms is every bit as significant and dangerous as smuggling drugs,’ said Judge Robbins of Sanghera’s firearms offence.

There was sobbing in a packed public gallery as sentence was passed.
