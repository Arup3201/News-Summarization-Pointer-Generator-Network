The younger brother of country music singer Randy Travis is in custody for methamphetamine possession, authorities said.

Union County sheriff's deputies say David ‘Butter’ Traywick of Marshville, North Carolina, was arrested last Thursday along with his wife during a raid at the family farm. 

Authorities identified the 49-year-old as the brother of the 53-year-old Grammy winning recording artist, who's recently had his own legal problems.

Travis, who lives in Texas and changed his name early in his music career, has been arrested at least three times in the last year.

That includes an August arrest for driving while intoxicated, wrecking his car and then laying nude in the middle of a highway.

Traywick's arrest report says he is suspected of cooking meth in a makeshift lab in the woods near his home.

According to kovideo.net, Traywick was also charged with drug possession and possession of drug paraphernalia.

Randy split from his wife and personal manager Elizabeth in 2010 after 19 years of marriage.

During
the span of his career, he has sold millions of albums and has won more
than two dozen major awards, including six Grammys.

His latest came earlier this year when he won best country collaboration for I Told You So, a duet with Carrie Underwood.
