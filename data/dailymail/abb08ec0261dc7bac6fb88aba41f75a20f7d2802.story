Queensland police have found a white utility buried under earth during an excavation while looking for a missing woman feared entombed in the vehicle.

Novy Chardon was 34 years old when she disappeared from her Upper Coomera home near the Gold Coast on February 6 last year.

Police said the man living at the Mount Nathan property in the Gold Coast Hinterland, where the search was conducted, knows Mrs Chardon's husband, John Chardon.

Police have confirmed the man living at Mount Nathan home knows Mrs Chardon's husband, John Chardon.

After finding the vehicle, the house on Eden Park Court was also searched as part of investigations.

The man who lives at the property has since been questioned by police about Mrs Chardon's disappearance.

His solicitor Campbell MacCallum arrived at the house and claimed his client's innocence.

The Gold Coast Bulletin reported Mr MacCallum said his client did bury the items in his backyard, but insists they have nothing to do with the unsolved case.

Police arrived at the house on Tuesday night after a search warrant was issued. An excavator was needed to remove earth covering the vehicle, which was found on Wednesday

The man living at the property has denied having any knowledge or involvement in the case

'The person residing at this address denies any knowledge or involvement in the investigation,' he said.

'He’s a bit upset and denies any involvement ... He doesn’t think there’s anything to worry about.'

Mr MacCallum said police were looking for a vehicle and he did not know how his client knew Mrs Chardon’s husband, John Chardon.

Detecive Superintendent David Hutchinson said the search was sparked by information they received from neighbours.

'Well, obviously it’s an unusual thing to bury a car in a backyard,' Det Supt Hutchinson said.

Missing: Vanishing on February 6 last year, police say there is no doubt Novy Chardon (pictured) has been murdered

Mrs Chardon's husband John Chardon (pictured) is currently overseas. He has denied playing any part in the disappearance despite his lawyer calling him the chief suspect in court

'We believe we know the reason why the vehicle was buried there, but we obviously need to excavate the land and recover the vehicle to confirm the exact situation.

'We don’t have any information at this time that Novy Chardon is buried there.

'I think burying a utility in the backyard, by itself, raises suspicions so you would have to wonder why they would do that. We understand, we believe, why that occurred, but we want to recover the vehicle first to substantiate things. But if you’re going to bury it in the back yard, you probably wouldn’t do it at night.'

Det Supt Hutchinson said John Chardon, who is travelling overseas, had not been contacted about the discovery.

Since discovering the car, police are using an excavator to dig it out.

Neighbour Scot Viner said he saw the property owners excavating the backyard about a year ago during renovations.

The Courier Mail reported Mr Viner said his son was riding the property owner's digger while they were digging holes.

Mount Nathan, where the excavation has taken place, is located in the Gold Coast Hinterland in Queensland

On the day she disappeared, Mrs Chardon visited her lawyer to finalise a divorce settlement

'He (the owner) was digging a spot. He was saying a water tower is going here and a deck is going there. It’s hard to believe anything suspicious about it,' he said.

Adding to speculation that the missing Indonesian-born woman could be entombed in a car, Mr Viner said he saw a car sitting in the backyard ‘for ages’. He said he was unsure if the car had been buried.

Senior-Sergeant Mark Procter, of Coomera CIB, said a search warrant was executed about 5pm Tuesday on the Mount Nathan rental property ‘in relation to the disappearance of Novy Chardon’.

'The house has been declared a crime scene and an excavator is being brought in,' he said.

'We expect the property to remain a crime scene for a number of days.’

Police launched a murder investigation after the mother-of-two disappeared on February 6 last year - the dig comes about a month after the first anniversary of her disappearance.

Just two days after Mrs Chardon went missing, her 66-year old millionaire husband took the couple's two young children on a pre-planned business trip to Indonesia.

He remained overseas for several weeks and at the time said Mrs Chardon had gone missing before and denied playing any part in her disappearance despite previously being named in court as the chief suspect by his own lawyer.

No doubt: Police believe they are dealing with a murder case and said more than one person was involved in causing Mrs Chardon's death and disposing of the body

Police said last month there was 'no doubt' Mrs Chardon had been murdered with ‘more than one person was involved in causing her death and disposing of the body’.

They also said that on the day of her disappearance, Mrs Chardon visited her lawyer to finalise a divorce settlement.

The Courier-Mail reported that during police investigations several suspects had been identified and were facing interrogation at Crime and Misconduct Commission secret ‘star chamber’ hearings.

After her disappearance, Mrs Chardon’s late model Volvo SUV was found abandoned near Nerang railway station.

Police seized Mr Chardon’s car at Brisbane Airport, raided his Loganholme lubricant factory and the family home was declared a crime scene.

An arrest related to the case is yet to be made and Mr Chardon is believed to be overseas on a business trip.
