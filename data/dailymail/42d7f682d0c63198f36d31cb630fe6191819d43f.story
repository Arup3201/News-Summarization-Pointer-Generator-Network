Liam Ridgewell has joined Wigan Athletic on a short-term loan from MLS side Portland Timbers.

The former West Bromwich Albion, Birmingham City and Aston Villa defender has joined the Championship strugglers for six weeks in a bid to boost their fight for survival. 

Manager Malky Mackay said the capture of the 30-year-old was a much-needed boost after losing six of his first eight games in charge of Wigan, who are second from bottom in the Championship.

He said: 'As soon as we found out Liam was a possibility, we moved quickly. We have him until the start of the MLS season in mid-February and hopefully we can make good use of his experience in that time.

'He is a top-pro who has spent the majority of his career in the Premier League but he also knows this league inside out having earned promotion with Birmingham and he will add the kind of experience that will be crucial to us at this time.' 

Wigan are hopeful the deal can be signed off by Portland in time for Ridgewell to play in Saturday's match at Birmingham as the side attempt to improve on their 23rd place in the table.
