A mysterious joker has been spotted hanging upside down from bus stops and monuments around a city centre - dressed as Batman.

The unknown caped crusader has built up an internet following after being spotted around Nottingham over the last few months.

Astonishingly, the brazen Batman has been seen suspending himself by his ankles in daylight.

The caped crusader is actually a plasterer by day who wants to help 'save people from their misery'

The mysterious Batman impersonator has been pictured hanging from his ankles in various places in the city

He has been spotted several times in and around the city's famous town hall.

The Batman impersonator, who admits he is actually a plaster who lives near the real Gotham in Nottingham, has even set up his own Facebook account.

Speaking on his Facebook page, he wrote: 'There aren't enough people smiling these days and there are too many negative things happening in the world.

'I want to be a positive influence and be the hero who saves people from their misery.

Nottingham's superhero said his superpower is the ability to make people laugh

'As long as people are smiling, that's what it's all about.

'I'm hoping the more people spot me, the more I will be able to raise my profile. I want people to start trying to find me and hunt me out at places they think I might be.

'I want them to take pictures of me or photo-bomb me, and then share? the pictures on Facebook and Twitter.

'The aim is to become a figurehead of fun in Nottingham.

'All I'll say is that I'm a very outgoing character and can be quite random.

'My super power is being able to make people laugh.

'I'm also a fan of the Batman films, although I thought George Clooney was pretty rubbish.

'I'm looking forward to seeing how Ben Affleck plays it.

The dad-of-one even has a trusty sidekick - but he only describes himself as an 'assistant', rather than Robin.

The 30-year-old said: 'I wouldn't call myself Robin as I feel as though I would be lowering myself - I'm nobody's Robin.

'I think I'm more of a Joker character, although that would mean I would lose in a fight against Batman.'

The Batman sightings comes months after the sinister 'Northampton Clown' became an internet sensation after dozens of pictures emerged of him standing in the town at night.
