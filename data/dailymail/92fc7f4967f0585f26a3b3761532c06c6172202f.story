She's famous for her love of fashion but it seems Spain's Queen Letizia isn't above wearing the same ensemble twice.

The Spanish royal was glamorous in a windowpane check top by Hugo Boss, last worn for Spanish Red Cross Day last month, as she welcomed charity campaigners to the Zarzuela Palace today.

Letizia, 42, met dignitaries from the 'One Toy, One Dream' initiative which raises funds to buy toys to send to impoverished children living in the Third World.

Favourite: Queen Letizia was last seen in the glamorous top on Spanish Red Cross Day last month

Support: The royal was meeting organisers of the One Toy, One Dream campaign at the Zarzuela Palace

The royal has long been a supporter of the campaign, which is now in its 15th year, and sends more than 500,000 toys to Iraq, Ethiopia, Morocco, Senegal and Peru - among many others - each year.

Run by the Grow Up Playing Foundation, the campaign has also established 1,400 'toy libraries' around the world, each of which contains up to 400 toys that can be enjoyed by children aged two or above.

The charity meeting came at the start of yet another busy week for Letizia and hot on the heels of an action-packed seven days that saw the Spanish royals welcome Chile's President Michelle Bachelet to Madrid.

Letizia also visited Vienna, where, along with making a speech in English and German, she launched a new exhibition dedicated to Spanish artist Diego Velázquez.

Important work: The campaign sends 500,000 toys to children in 22 different countries each year

Warm welcome: The organisers enjoyed an audience with the Spanish queen, 42, in Madrid

Velázquez, who was born in 1599, is best known for his 1656 work, Las Meninas, which is usually housed in Madrid's Prado Museum.

The painting, which shows Infanta Margarita Teresa surrounded by her maids of honour and servants, was commissioned by Felipe IV - an ancestor of the current King Felipe.

Las Meninas also has an Austrian connection as Infanta Margarita went on to become the Holy Roman Empress and wife of Leopold I who oversaw the running of his lands from the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.

Busy: The engagement came hot on the heels of a busy seven days for Queen Letizia and her husband

Glittering: Last week, Letizia and Felipe welcomed Chile's Michelle Bachelet to Madrid

Striking: For the state dinner last week, Letizia was striking in an elegant black lace gown

It was also at the Hofburg that Margarita died in 1673 aged just 21, although not before she gave her husband four children, all of whom - Maria Antonia, Electress of Bavaria notwithstanding - died in childhood.

Despite the tragic story behind Las Meninas, it remains one of Velázquez' most famous paintings, if not the only one he did of Infanta Margarita.

Letizia, although not famous for her love of art, has made supporting her native culture a key part of her role, and, along with King Felipe, is a patron of the Real Academia Española - the official royal institution charged with overseeing the Spanish language.
