Fiji authorities have confirmed that its 45 United Nations peacekeepers, who are being held captive by terrorists in Syria, appear in a recent YouTube video.

The footage, which was posted on Wednesday, shows two men speaking Arabic while Fijian troops sit cross-legged behind them.

One Fijian soldier, who speaks in English, said September 9 marked a 'very happy day'.

'We've been informed that we will be released soon, and we are all very happy to be going home,' he said.

It's been confirmed the 45 Fijian soldiers are 'safe and alive' whilst being held by Nusra Front terrorists

Most of the 15-minute video is films the two men speaking Arabic but near the end, a Fijian soldier says the troops have been treated well by the Nusra Front.

'We're all safe and alive,' he said.

'I would like to assure you that we have not been harmed in any way.

'I deeply understand with the limited resources that they have [the Nusra Front], they have provided the best for us and we really appreciate it.'

Fijian government spokeswoman Sharon Smith-Johns said the soldiers shown in the video are those being held by the Nusra Front. She identified the soldier who speaks as Captain Savenaca Rabuka.

At the beginning of the video, the men speaking in Arabic say that God had helped the Nusra Front soldiers and other fighters 'liberate' the Quneitra border crossing which marks the area between Syrian-controlled territory and the Israeli part of the Golan Heights.

The video surfaced a day after Fiji may have jumped the gun by announcing that the peacekeepers would soon be released.

At a Wednesday morning news conference in Suva, Fiji's military chief said they had been told by U.N. headquarters in New York that the Nusra Front had agreed to release the men later this week without any conditions or demands.

The South Pacific nation later tried to retract the comments, but by then they had been reported around the world.

It is unlikely Fiji would have been given the green light to release any specific information by the U.N., which typically doesn't comment on sensitive captive situations until they are resolved.

The Nusra Front had earlier listed three demands for releasing the Fijian peacekeepers it took captive August 28.

The group had demanded to be taken off the U.N. terrorist list, wanted humanitarian aid delivered to parts of the Syrian capital Damascus, and wanted compensation for three of its fighters it says were killed in a shootout with U.N. officers.
