Millions of workers with final salary pensions face tax rises to pay for a new universal flat pension.

The Coalition has agreed to overhaul the complicated pensions system and replace it with a flat retirement income of around £155 a week from 2017.

But some workers will have to pay hundreds more every year because they will no longer be able to opt out of the state second pension, which is to be scrapped.

Hike: Millions of middle-class earners in the UK could face higher national insurance contributions as a result of government plans to introduce a new single-tier pensions system

The six million workers who currently opt out will be left paying an extra 1.4 per cent in national insurance contributions.

Those earning £40,000 a year will pay an annual extra £481 under the new system, while those on the average salary of around £25,000 will fork out an extra £270, according to financial firm Hargreaves Lansdown.

Most of the workers on final salary schemes work in the public sector.

Around 1.4million are in the private sector – usually long-serving employees of large firms.

Increase: Financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdowne said an employee earning £25,000 will face extra national insurance payments of £270 every year, while those earning £40,000 will see an increase of £481

Currently final salary workers can opt 
out of paying in to the state second pension and divert the money into 
their more generous schemes.

It also gives employers a tax break. But this will be taken away.

Experts warned that the changes could spell the end of the 6,300 final salary schemes still in existence because employers face tax raises of up to 3.4 per cent.

They face bills of an extra £657 for each employee earning £25,000, and £1,168 for those on £40,000.

Those who are likely to benefit from the flat pension, which will be officially unveiled next week, are likely to be women who have taken time out from the workforce to care for children, part-time workers and those on low and middle incomes.

The self-employed could also gain.

But those on high or middle incomes, or with generous final salary packages, stand to lose.

Tom McPhail, of Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘Employees are going to be upset because they’ll pay more, but many of them will end up doing better out of this. It will prompt another round of scheme closures.’

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ‘This is all part of simplifying the state pension system so that everyone paying in NICs knows exactly what they get in return.’
