When she found herself suffering from anxiety attacks brought on by the menopause, Mariella Frostrup was relieved to learn they could be treated.

She was rather less happy, however, when her insurer refused to pay – on the grounds that menopause-related ailments are considered ‘natural’.

Now the presenter, 52, has accused AXA PPP of ageism and sexism after it declined to fund her treatment despite the fact she forks out £400 a month to cover her family against medical problems.

Miss Frostrup, who also suffers from insomnia, said she cannot turn to the NHS as it does not offer the combination of treatments she requires – leaving her ‘caught between a rock and a hard place’.

Mariella Frostrup, 52, suffers from anxiety attacks due to the menopause. While there is medication available to help, she has been told her health insurer won't cover 'anything to do with the menopause'

Speaking to a gathering of advertising experts, she said: ‘I am going to tell you something very intimate.

‘Like a lot of people my age, I had been suffering from sleeplessness and strange anxiety about things like the Ocado shopping list – stuff that really doesn’t matter in the great scheme of things. I wake at 2am and think: “Did I put carrots on the list?”’

Miss Frostrup, who presents BBC Radio 4’s Open Book and is an editor of High50 magazine for older people, said her GP recommended she see a ‘brilliant gynaecologist’ specialising in the menopause.

But before having an appointment, she had to ask AXA PPP for ‘pre-authorisation’ to make sure it would pay for the treatment. 

She said: ‘The girl who answered the phone went away, came back around three minutes later and said “has anyone mentioned early menopause to you?” 

'I said, “No one’s mentioned early menopause, but they have mentioned menopause, and it is something we’re looking into. Hence the reason I need the pre-authorisation for this appointment”.

‘And she said, “Sorry, we don’t cover anything to do with the menopause”.’

The presenter claimed she was told this is because the menopause is ‘natural’. But she said she could not find the clause in the small-print of her insurance booklet.

‘I would say the majority of ailments are natural,’ she said. 

‘There are so many side effects of menopause, and it affects different women differently, so the insurers can use this as a blanket ban.’

Miss Frostrup requires a personally tailored combination of adrenal stimulants, sleep and anxiety medications, and diet supplements administered by a specialist – which is not available on the NHS.

She added: ‘The NHS solution is hormone replacement therapy patches, which is a blunt mallet, so women are stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place.

‘The woman on the phone agreed it would be better if my symptoms were a mental health issue as they could cover that. Clearly madness is more palatable to them than menopause.

‘I have had a health insurance policy for 32 years. To discover that at the point when, for the first time in your life, you may want a little bit of help with your medical situation they point blank refuse is extraordinary.

‘For me, it was a moment of clarification in terms of ageism in society, in terms of attitudes to women in society, in terms of attitudes of companies to women. 

'They think we are so powerless we can’t respond to a situation like that.’

Miss Frostrup was speaking at the launch of new research by communications agency JWT. It found 65 per cent of over-50s felt ignored by the fashion industry.

She criticised the use of younger fashion models, saying it had made her daughter Molly, ten, insecure about her body. 

‘We live in a world where everything is soft focus – make everyone look beautiful, make them look like they’re 12 years old,’ she said. ‘It’s bad for everybody.’ 

An AXA PPP spokesman said: ‘We have started an investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further until we have completed it.’
