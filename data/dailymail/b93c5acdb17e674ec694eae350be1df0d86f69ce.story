The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance has released a comprehensive tax bulletin defining the everyday sandwich in order to clarify what is subject to sales tax.

It includes a broad definition of the sandwich, as well as types of common, and less common, bread-based snacks which it defines as sandwiches.

The department released the bulletin to explain what is considered a sandwich in a 'simplified language on a topic of interest to taxpayers'.

Bad news for lovers of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches - the snack is subject to sales tax in New York

For those unaware, a sandwich is: 'cold and hot sandwiches of every 
kind that are prepared and ready to be eaten, whether made on bread, on 
bagels, on rolls, in pitas, in wraps, or otherwise, and regardless of 
the filling or number of layers'.

'A sandwich can be as simple as a buttered bagel or roll, or as elaborate as a six-foot, toasted submarine sandwich.'

The bulletin reads almost like a shop menu - breaking out into a list of everyday 'common' sandwiches that include the BLT, club sandwiches, and cold cut and grilled cheese sandwiches.

And
 those hoping to circumvent the tax will be disappointed to hear the 
bulletin doesn't dodge sandwiches of the much-loved peanut butter and 
jelly variety.

It then details a number of other sandwiches that are listed outside of those deemed 'common'.

They include bagels, burritos, croissants, flatbread and breakfast sandwiches, and - one which is sure to rankle with the sandwich purists - hamburgers and hotdogs.

Sandwiches
 are generally subject to sales tax. This bulletin explains what is 
considered a sandwich for sales tax purposes. Additional resources 
relating to sales of food and beverages (e.g. sales by restaurants or 
food stores, sales from vending machines, or sales of candy) are listed 
at the end of this bulletin.

What is considered a sandwich

Sandwiches
 include cold and hot sandwiches of every kind that are prepared and 
ready to be eaten, whether made on bread, on bagels, on rolls, in pitas,
 in wraps, or otherwise, and regardless of the filling or number of 
layers. A sandwich can be as simple as a buttered bagel or roll, or as 
elaborate as a six-foot, toasted submarine sandwich.

Some examples of taxable sandwiches include:

   - BLTs (bacon, lettuce, and tomato sandwiches), club sandwiches, cold cut sandwiches, grilled cheese sandwiches, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, salad-type sandwiches (e.g., chicken, egg, ham, and tuna);

Exempt sales

Sales
 of sandwiches are not taxable if the purchaser is exempt from sales tax
 and gives the seller a properly completed exemption certificate.

Purchases for resale

Sandwiches
 generally cannot be purchased for resale. When a sandwich that has been
 taxed is subsequently resold, the seller must collect tax from the 
purchaser on the selling price. However, the seller may take a credit on
 its sales tax return for the actual amount of tax that it originally 
paid.

The 
department is responsible for collecting tax for New York State, 
including more than $14 billion in local sales tax and $8 billion in 
local income tax.

It
 has published bulletins on a number of other taxable items, including 
one on beverages sold by food stores - 'beverages are liquids that are 
suitable for humans to drink' - and the perhaps more useful 
clarification on the tax status of dietary supplements.
