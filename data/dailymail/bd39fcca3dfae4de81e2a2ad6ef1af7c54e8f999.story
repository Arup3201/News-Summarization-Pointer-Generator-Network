After another meek surrender, the widespread belief that Everton are far too good to go down may have to be re-examined.

Once again, Roberto Martinez's team were dramatically less than the collection of their parts and the amiable Spaniard seems unable to identify what is rotten in the core of his team.

Goals in each half from Victor Moses – a long-range header no less – and Mame Biram Diouf deservedly gave Stoke City the points as Mark Hughes' side rose to eighth in the table, a remarkable 14 points ahead of their beleaguered visitors.

The statistics for Everton are damning. Just one win in 12 league games, just one league clean sheet away from Goodison Park since September. Ross Barkley, their bright young hope, was kept on the bench while those who played laboured.

Poor Aaron Lennon was barracked mercilessly by the Stoke fans after he snubbed them in January to join Everton and was substituted after 60 forgettable minutes. Gareth Barry picked up his 10th booking of the season, and a record 106th of his career, and will miss the next two games against Newcastle and QPR. The speed the 34-year-old moved about the Britannia, that might be a blessing for everyone.

What is perplexing is the individual quality on show for Everton. Established internationals like Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka, Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy, Romelu Lukaku and others are the reason they are the sole English survivors in the Europa League.

But standing just six points above the bottom three, an almost-inconceivable double – qualification for the Champions League and relegation to the Championship – is still possible.

'It is a tough and demanding period. But there is no such thing as fear, we showed last year we have a really talented squad. We have 30 points to fight for and we are going to give our lives to get as many as we can,' said Martinez.

'We are all disappointed, the fans, the players, everyone but we are going to recover for the next challenge which we are desperate to face. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong, that is what happens when you have negative momentum. But we are not looking down, we want to get as many points as we can.'

Everton fans seemed divided at the end, some booed and some encouraged their fallen idols. They will all be glad to see Leighton Baines back from injury in time to face Newcastle in their next league game on March 15.

Without him, Everton's defence looked flimsy. After 32 minutes, Phil Bardsley's cross was met with a tremendous leap by Moses, who headed over Howard from 12 yards. 

Why Everton's centre-halves Jagielka and John Stones backed off to give Moses a free header was unclear and they immediately held a post-goal inquest.

'We restricted them to very few opportunites afterwards,' said Stoke boss Mark Hughes.

Of those that did come, Lennon shot straight at Asmir Begovic and Romelu Lukaku dragged a shot wide, a feeble finish denoting a lack of confidence. 

Substitute Arouna Kone had the best shot which was well parried by Begovic.

If anything, Stoke looked likelier to add a second once Diouf had replaced Peter Crouch, and so it proved. 

A quick Stoke counter-attack saw the ball cannon off Stones in Diouf's path. He led the charge with Marko Arnautovic and when the Austrian struck the post, Diouf followed up to prod in the rebound.

Stoke's 2-0 victory means Everton have already conceded 41 Premier Leageu goals in 28 games. They let in just 39 in the whole of last season.

'We deserved it, Victor Moses was excellent, he showed strength to the end,' said a delighted Hughes.

Stoke were everything Everton weren't, fully commmited to a gameplan. They even recovered from the loss of centre-half Philipp Wollscheid who limped off early, but it was Martinez who complained about the bad luck.

'Six of our 10 games left are at Goodison Park and that is a powerful tool for us,' he said in what was effectively a rallying cry for everyone at the club. 

Everton finished fifth last season and were predicted to make a tip at the Champions League. Instead they are relying on clubs like Burnley and QPR being worse than they are.

'This is a really talented squad but we are in a period where things are going wrong. The first time we allowed Stoke a cross into our box, they score from it from an unlikely source. We feel there was a foul on Phil Jagielka in the build-up for the second goal at a time when we were making chances.'

Martinez talks a good game. Now his team have to play one.
