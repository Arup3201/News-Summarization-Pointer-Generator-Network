Criticism: Leader of Aberdeen City Council, Councillor Barney Crockett, has been accused of using taxpayers' cash to fund a 'jolly' to Japan

A council leader has been accused of spending thousands of taxpayers’ cash on a 'jolly' to Japan.

Councillor Barney Crockett spent six days in the Far East so he could visit to the International Hydrogen Fuel Expo.

But he is alleged to have spent just 90 minutes in a meeting about hydrogen at the expo and much of the remainder of the trip visiting tourist sights and hosting dinners.

Rival politician Callum McCaig, of the SNP, said: 'I don’t think this is justifiable.

'From the agenda I’ve seen the visit was incredibly light on real work and has all the hallmarks of a jolly.

'It is full of visits, wining and dining that would be beyond the means of most people.'

A council spokeswoman confirmed the 11,000-mile round trip last month cost £2103.86 per person - totalling more than £8,000 - which came out of the council's general fund which is approximately £380million a year.

A spokesman for the Taxpayer’s Alliance Scotland said: 'What are the priorities when a councillor chooses a long-distance jolly rather than serve his own community?

'We all know Aberdeen has huge assets in this [hydrogen] sector but there is no need to promote these abilities at such a huge expense when they’re known globally.'

Cllr Crockett, leader of Aberdeen City Council, hit back at his critics, saying: 'I was at the conference for a lot longer than an hour and a half.

'I think how the trip built up was of great support to hydrogen projects in the city which have a huge importance for the area.

'This is just more of the smear and bullying tactics we are seeing from the SNP, and they are trying to personalise it. But if I think something is right for the city then I will do it.'

The trip included visits to Kosuge slip-dock which was designed in part by Scotsman Thomas Blake Glover, the man-made Dejima island and the man-made Nagasaki peace park which commemorates the atomic bombing in 1945.

The four man delegation also dined with the mayor of Nagasaki, chairman of the city council, Nagasaki Rotary Club and the Japan-British Society of Nagasaki during the visit. 

Councillor Willie Young, Convener of Aberdeen City Council's Finance, Policy and Resources Committee argued that the trip was of vital importance as the council is heavily investing in hydrogen fuel.

He said: 'Of course there's always private time on any trip but lots of important engagements took place.

'We spent 90 minutes in a meeting at the expo but we were at the conference for more than four hours in total.

'Every single day there were specific meetings about hydrogen. These were extremely valuable and worthwhile as the council is putting £10million of public money into hydrogen-run buses.'

A council spokeswoman added: 'The trip was unanimously approved by the Enterprise, Strategic Planning and Infrastructure Committee in August. 

But it is claimed Cllr Barney Crockett, pictured, and those who joined him on the trip had a meeting lasting just 90 minutes at the expo and spent the rest of their six-day trip sight-seeing and hosting dinners

'Aberdeen is leading on hydrogen for the Scottish Cities Alliance and the purpose of the trip was to attend and participate in an important conference on hydrogen and associated technologies, as well as to meet with potential partners, including in the automotive industry, who have expressed an interest in working with Aberdeen on its various hydrogen projects which will establish a hydrogen economy and secure Aberdeen's position as a leading world energy city for the future.'

But SNP Group Leader Callum McCaig claims this trip did little to promote Aberdeen and its hydrogen economy - which was one of the main reasons it went ahead.

He said: 'We were told that the trip would promote Aberdeen and the hydrogen economy however this does not seem to have been high on the agenda.

'With only 90 minutes of meetings scheduled and lots of sightseeing and dining out.

'Indeed, when challenged directly on television, Cllr Crockett specifically denied that he was on a jolly, and claimed he was working flat out for the city. It is now clear that this was absolutely not the case, and it is clear that he appeared to think nobody would find out the truth.

'Cllr Crockett appears to have become very fond of overseas travel, like when he wastefully flew to New York to collect an award for an arms-length body and now he has gone to Japan for 90 minutes of meetings.

'This is yet another example of how the Council Leader and Finance Convenor are mismanaging this council.'
