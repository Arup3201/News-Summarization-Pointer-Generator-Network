They could be mistaken for an intricate lego display, or a pile of colourful milk crates stacked up high.

But take a closer look and these mesmerising photographs show the vast scale of soaring apartment blocks in one of the most densely populated regions in the world - Hong Kong.

As home to a population of more than seven million crammed into an area measuring just 424 square miles, space on the island is at a premium.

These mesmerising images by photographer Peter Stewart capture the sheer scale of the soaring apartment blocks in one of the world's most densely populated cities - Hong Kong

With seven million people crammed into a city, which covers 424 square miles, space is at a premium and the only way to go is up

The result is soaring skyscrapers towering above the city to provide enough homes for the vast population

People live in apartments crammed into sky-high tower blocks, their laundry spilling over balconies, which overlook one another

It means that, when it comes to providing accommodation for Hong Kong's huge population, the only way to go is up.

These optical illusions, captured by landscape photographer Peter Stewart, show the state in a totally different and colourful light.

From a distance the images appear to depict giant lego constructions or stacks of crates piled high.

But the bright colours are in fact the vast fascias of tower blocks across the area.

The images reveal the densely-packed apartments crammed into towering skyscrapers, with laundry spilling from barred windows and hanging over cramped balconies.

Mr Stewart, said: 'Photographing the Hong Kong skyline and suburbia has always been a dream of mine.

'A
 lot of people see high rise buildings as drab and an eyesore, but I 
look at them in the positive light and actually think they have a lot of
 appeal.

'Whenever I look 
at the photo's I wonder who's in that apartment, and what they are 
doing, and this just gives so much depth to the photo's and I can sit 
looking at them for hours.'

Mr Stewart's clever images turn what is a sprawling concrete jungle into a bright montage of colours

The giant tower blocks come in all shapes and sizes, fitting as many homes as possible into the city's 424 square miles

From afar the images could be mistaken for an elaborate lego construction or milk crates stacked up high

But on closer inspection the eye is drawn to the open windows, washing hanging from balconies and blinds partially drawn

Mr Stewart said photographing the city had been a long-held dream. 'Whenever I look at the photos I wonder who's in that apartment, and what are they doing... I can sit and look at them for hours'

Recent statistics show that Hong Kong has more skyscrapers than any other region in the world and has more buildings higher than 500ft than any other place on the globe.

High rise buildings are so common as they meet the demand for the ever growing population of the bustling Chinese island, but such buildings don't always have a great aesthetic appeal.

As some of the photo's show, buildings are designed in such a way that they outlook onto other people's balconies, in prisms blocked from most natural daylight.

But, Mr Stewart's work has captured the character, of the bustling communities who live in these cumbersome tenement blocks.

He said: 'The architecture of the city is great and I love the angles, the clever design of the city how everything slots in to place.

'It's probably one of the most exciting cities I've ever photographed in.'
