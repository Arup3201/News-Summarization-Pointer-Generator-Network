Nigel Farage’s wife has got another job working for Ukip – after being banned from working for her husband.

Party leader Mr Farage confessed earlier this year that he was paying his wife £27,000 a year from his parliamentary allowances, funded by the taxpayer, to work as his secretary – despite declaring in 2004 that ‘Ukip MEPs will not employ wives’ and ‘there will be no exceptions’.

Now, after the EU introduced new rules banning the employment of family members, his wife Kirsten has been forced to look elsewhere for work – and has found it with another Ukip MEP.

Employed: Nigel Farage and his wife - and former secretary Kirsten, who is newly employed by his close ally

German-born Kirsten – the second Mrs Farage – is now employed by MEP Ray Finch, a close friend and ally of the party leader, although he lives in Winchester, Hampshire, 80 miles from the Farage family home in Kent. 

The move is likely to attract gibes that Mr and Mrs Farage are still managing to ‘ride the Brussels gravy train’.

Kirsten, a bond broker whom Mr Farage met during a trip to Frankfurt in 1996, has defended her role as his former taxpayer-funded secretary, saying she often worked late, and that Mr Farage was virtually computer illiterate.

She said: ‘I sit at my computer in my nightie and am very dutiful.

‘He has a steam-powered telephone, he can send and receive texts and that’s it. 

'If I sit him down, and there is something for him to read, he can scroll up and down, he has learned that, but that is pretty much it.

Ally: Ray Finch, a close friend of the Ukip leader, has taken on Kirsten, keeping her 'on the Brussels gravy train'

Further controversy: Bill Etheridge MEP told youth members to copy Adolf Hitler's 'magnetic' rhetoric

‘He honestly doesn’t know how to [use a computer] and he has missed the boat, I don’t think he ever will now.’

When asked earlier this year what would happen when the ban on employing family members came in, she claimed: ‘We have not really had time to discuss it. I think the job carries on but I just won’t get paid for it.’

Mr Farage ran into more controversy earlier this year when a former Ukip MEP accused him of also putting his ‘mistress’ on his Brussels payroll.

The Ukip leader vigorously denied any relationship with Annabelle Fuller, a party spin doctor, who also refuted the claims.
