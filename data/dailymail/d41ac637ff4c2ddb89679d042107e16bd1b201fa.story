A doctor who became infected with Ebola while working in Liberia is sick but in stable condition and communicating with his caregivers at the Nebraska Medical Center, officials said Friday.

Dr. Rick Sacra, 51, is being treated at a 10-bed special isolation unit, the largest of the United States' four. It was built to handle patients with highly infectious and deadly diseases, according to Dr. Mark Rupp, chief of the infectious diseases division at the center.

Sacra— the third American aid worker sickened with the virus — arrived at 6:38 a.m. Friday at the Omaha hospital. Sacra was wheeled on a gurney off the plane at Offutt Air Force Base, transferred to an ambulance and then wheeled into the hospital, said Rosanna Morris, chief nursing officer for the medical center.

Sacra was conscious Friday and was able to communicate with medical staff, Morris said. 

Sacra's plane landed at the Offutt Air Force Base Friday morning and he was
transported to the medical center in an ambulance escorted by
state highway patrol, said Jenny Nowatzke, media relations
coordinator with the medical center.

Sacra walked onto the airplane in Liberia on Thursday. He
will be treated at the Nebraska hospital's Biocontainment
Patient Care Unit, Christian missionary organization SIM USA said on
Thursday.

Sacra did health work for SIM USA in Liberia as did two
other U.S. missionaries infected with Ebola, Nancy Writebol and
Kent Brantly, who were also flown back to the U.S. for
treatment.

The plane carrying the third U.S.
missionary infected with the Ebola virus in Liberia left the
West African country's capital on Thursday.

The virus has
killed more than 1,900 people.

Debbie Sacra, wife of Dr. Sacra, made a statement on Thursday at 5 p.m. EDT at University of Massachusetts Medical School. 

'I
 am overwhelmed and abundantly blessed by all the kind words that people
 have said about Rick since the news of his sickness was released,' his wife Debbie told the press as she fought back tears.

'When
 he left at the beginning of August, we understood there was a risk he 
could become sick with this deadly virus but I knew that he needed to go
 and be with the Liberian people who needed a hospital to be open,' she added.

Debbie Sacra spoke of her husband's dedication to helping those in Liberia in need who fell victim to the deadly virus. She compared his love for people and his efforts to those of Jesus before he died and she said her husband is not afraid of death.

She said that her husband's wish is that workers do all that they can to avoid exposure to the virus, reports the Boston Globe.

'He is not someone who can stand back when there is a need that he can take care of. His word to everyone who is watching these broadcasts is that the need in West Africa is desperate and there are resources that can be deployed to make sure that all healthcare workers have enough gloves and gowns and boots and thermometers to protect themselves from possible Ebola exposures and continue caring for those who need other medical care.'

'Please find a practical way to meet the needs of Liberia and its neighbors in this time of fear and suffering. As Rick wrote to his medical colleagues, this epidemic is a wildfire about to rage out of control,' she concluded.

 A Reuters cameraman saw Sacra, wearing a white protective
overall, step out of the car that brought him to the tarmac. He was able to walk onto the aircraft in Liberia without assistance.

Liberian Information Minister Lewis Brown confirmed that the
plane carrying Sacra was identical to the Gulfstream jet that
ferried Nancy Writebol and Dr. Kent Brantly, who had contracted
the disease in July while working at the missionary group's
health facilities in Liberia.

'Rick was receiving excellent care from our SIM/ELWA staff
in Liberia at our Ebola 2 Care Center,' said Bruce Johnson,
president of SIM USA.

'They all love and admire him deeply. However, the Nebraska
Medical Center provides advanced monitoring equipment and wider
availability of treatment options,' Johnson said.

Nebraska medical center said in a statement that they will keep Sacra in their Biocontainment Patient Care Unit.

'We want everyone to know that every precaution is being taken in transporting this patient here and caring for them once they arrive,' said Angela Hewlett, MD, associate medical director of the Biocontainment Unit.

'This is one of the safest places in the country for this patient to be treated, both for the public and for the medical professionals providing care,' she added.

Sacra had volunteered to return to Liberia, where he has
long offered medical services, when the two other U.S. health
workers were infected.

Writebol and Brantly have since recovered after being flown
back to the United States for treatment in an isolation unit at
Emory University Hospital in Atlanta.

Sacra had not been caring for Ebola patients but was
delivering babies, and had been following protocols to prevent
the disease, the group said. It was not known how he contracted
the disease.
