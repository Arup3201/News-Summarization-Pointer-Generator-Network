While many of Scott Sinclair's team-mates have been enjoying the sun by playing in the heat of Brazil for the World Cup, the Manchester City winger has taken a more relaxing route to soak in rays.

Having spent the season on loan and featuring very little at West Brom, a trip to Copacabana was never going to be high on the 25-year-old's priorities this summer.

Instead, Sinclair has enjoyed time north of all the Brazil 2014 action as he enjoyed a beach holiday with girlfriend Helen Flanagan in Mexico.

Sinclair has struggled to make an impact since joining the Premier League champions in 2012, failing to break into the team since moving from Swansea.

But ahead of a campaign where the winger will hope to get a once promising career back on track, Sinclair looked to have little concern for his City future as he relaxed with Helen Flanagan.

The pair looked loved-up as they walked hand-in-hand across the sand.

However, the holiday wasn’t all fun and games for Helen as she took to Instagram to reveal she had lost her Taylor Morris sunglasses in the sea.

She wrote: ‘Discovered Cutler and Gross today as I lost my @taylormorrisldn pair in the waves in Mexico :( @taylormorrisldn is still my fave tho (sic)’

Helen looked to be in fantastic shape as she strutted her stuff on the beach with Scott, but she could soon be waving goodbye to her bikini body for nine months as she recently revealed the couple are ready to start trying for a baby.

The actress recently told Closer magazine: 'I've been on some really strong acne medication but I've just come off it because I'm ready to start trying for a baby with Scott.

'I've always wanted to be a young mum and I now feel ready. It's something I've wanted for ages and Scott's going to be a great dad.

'I just hope it doesn't take me too long. And I'm not bothered about getting married beforehand.'

Getting shirty: Helen also took to her Instagram account to post a racy picture of herself wearing an unbuttoned shirt while lying on a beach
