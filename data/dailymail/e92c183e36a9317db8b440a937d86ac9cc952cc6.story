The amount of people attending the cinema have hit an almighty slump over the past few weeks due to the entertainment value provided by the World Cup.

Ticket sales at cinema chain Cineworld are at a low as the general public have instead decided to stay at home or visit their local pubs to watch the prestigious tournament in Brazil.

Big audience: 17.9m UK residents watched Rooney and Co. against Uruguay on June 19

Major film distributors have consequently decided to delay major film releases until after the World Cup final on July 13.

Viewing figures for the World Cup on the other hand have been at a high during the duration of the tournament which kicked off on June 12.    

A staggering 17.9million people across the UK tuned in to watch England take on Uruguay in the Three Lions' second game of their World Cup campaign.

The aforementioned viewing figures were the largest in the UK since the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
