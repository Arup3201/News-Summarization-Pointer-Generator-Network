Walmart is recalling about 73,400 Mainstays five-piece card table and chair sets after customers lost more than just cash on the furniture - they lost their fingers.

The chairs, sold exclusively by the retail giant, can unexpectedly collapse, posing a fall hazard or potential finger injury, the Consumer Product Safety Commission said Thursday.

Walmart has received 10 reports of injuries caused by the cheap collapsible furniture, including one finger amputation and three fingertip amputations, the notice said.

Customers also complained of sprained or fractured fingers and there was one report of a sore back.

The recall includes the Mainstays card table sets with a black padded metal folding table and four black padded metal folding chairs.

'Made by: Dongguan Shin Din Metal & Plastic Products Co.' is printed on a white label on the bottom of the chairs.

This is the company that made the chair cushions.

The CPSC notice lists Heshan Camis Industrial Co. Ltd. as the Manufacturer, which is based in Guangdong, China.

The product was made in China and Taiwan, it states.

The sets were sold at Walmart stores across the U.S. and on its website from May 2013 through November 2013 for about $50.

The CPSC warned consumers to immediately stop using the set and return it to Walmart for a full refund.

Individuals may contact Walmart at (800) 925-6278 from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CT on Saturday, and from 12 p.m. to 6 p.m. CT on Sunday.
