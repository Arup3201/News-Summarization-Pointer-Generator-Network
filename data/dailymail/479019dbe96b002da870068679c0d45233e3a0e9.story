A paralyzed teenager who was found dead in a filthy, cockroach-infested home was covered with bedsores so deep her bone and organs could be seen, it has emerged.

Linda Kelley's heartbreaking living conditions were revealed during hearings into how the 18-year-old's case was handled by the Department of Child Services before her death in August.

A DCS case worker and employees from Damar Services, which provides care to patients with special needs, had visited the teen at her parents' home in Indianapolis just six days before she died.

Marion Juvenile Court Judge Marilyn Moores held hearings last month to see if staff had falsified positive reviews of the girl's living conditions, the Indianapolis Star reported.

Tragic: Linda Kelley, pictured holding her nephew, passed away in her parents' filthy home in August just six days after she was visited by child services. A judge has ruled there was 'negligent oversight' by staff

But she concluded that they did not. Instead, there was a 'negligent oversight, if not reckless disregard, of the conditions of the home', she said.

DCS Director Mary Beth Bonaventura said the girl was failed by multiple people, including the case worker, the DCS and her parents, Lavonne and John Kelley.

'It was almost like a perfect storm,' she told the Star. 'Nobody did the right thing for this child, or at least enough of the right things.'

The DCS case worker, Teresa Carter, said she was shocked when she learned about the conditions because when she visited six days earlier, the home was in good condition and the girl had smiled.

But after the death, she returned to the home and found it covered with dog feces, trash, soiled adult diapers and cigarette butts and saw bugs crawling through the refrigerator. 

She also learned that Linda had sores below her waist. An autopsy is still being conducted into the cause of the teenager's death, but Moores said she suffered from sepsis.  

Carer: The girl lived with her mother, Lavonne Kelley (pictured), and her father. Neither have been charged - and it is not known if they knew about the sores on the girl's legs - but police are investigating

'How could that have happened in less than a week's time?' she said, the Indy Star reported.

At the hearing, she admitted she had only checked some rooms in the house and did not check the Linda's legs for sores. She knew the girl had previously suffered a leg injury but after it healed, she did not see the need to continue to check her legs, she said. 

Carter said that she had been handling up to 28 cases at the time, whereas the legal limit in Indiana is 17. She explained that she was unable to keep up and could not sleep at night.

But the DCS, which fired Carter and her supervisor after Linda passed away, said that workload was not a valid excuse for the oversights, and that the visits should have been carried out more thoroughly.

The department had a long relationship with the Kelleys, who reportedly neglected their children in 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2012.

In December, the DCS learned the couple had failed to take their daughter to doctors appointments, including for a sore on her leg. When they checked the home at the time, it was filthy, records show.

The department entered into a judge-approved agreement with the family to clean up the conditions and attend all doctors' appointments. 

Loss: The 18-year-old had smiled at her case worker during the visit and the reports noted that the home was in good condition. Less than a week later, she was found dead in a feces-covered home

The couple apparently met the terms of their agreement and the case closed in mid-July, although Carter and Damar Services workers went for the final meeting on July 29.

The president of Damar Services, Jim Dalton, said his workers had never seen the home in such a terrible condition as on the day she died and that if they had, they would have reported it. 

No charges have been brought in the case, although police are investigating. An attorney for the girl's parents told the Indy Star that they are devastated by the death.

Both fired DCS employees are appealing their terminations.
