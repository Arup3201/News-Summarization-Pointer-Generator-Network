The Kardashian klan may be dealing with break-ups, new babies and typical daily dramas, but the ever-professional sisters proved it was business as usual when they unveiled their new clothing collection for Lipsy.

Following the success of their collection, which originally launched in Dorothy Perkins, the sisters are back with a second capsule collection, this time for Lipsy, which they modelled for a shoot lensed by controversial snapper Terry Richardson.

The trio originally had exclusive rights to sell their line at Dorothy Perkins, owned by Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, but a spokesperson for the high-street chain told MailOnline that after the contract ended, the girls decided to look at stocking their label elsewhere.

which will land in U.K. store Lipsy London on Thursday

'We feel that it was an amazing launch pad into the UK market for the Kardashians but we didn't want to distract from Dorothy Perkins as a brand,' said a spokesperson for Dorothy Perkins.

'At Dorothy Perkins we very much enjoyed working with the girls on their three exclusive collections between A/W 2012 and Summer 2013.

'We have continued to focus and strengthen the Dorothy Perkins own-bought Collections, with a particular emphasis on Style Essentials, where our customer comes to us for trend driven key pieces at great prices.

'It was therefore the right time to move on from the Kardashian Kollection project and we wish the girls and all of their team the very best for the future.'

The new Kardashian Kollection for Lipsy aims to stand out from anything the sisters have designed for their brand before.

There's a mix of higher-end, trend driven looks - and a higher price point to reflect that - with items retailing from £30 to £150.

Red alert: Cut out neckline bodycon dress, £50

Black out: Cut out dress, £55

One-piece: Lace halter jumpsuit, £75

Animal behaviour: Pussy bow blouse, £40

Furry nice: Cropped full feather jacket, £150.00

All white: White PU shift dress, £60

Graphic: Lipsy geo leopard midi dress, £55

Leather look: Embroidered PU shift dress, £65

Voluptuous: Cut out dress, £55

Leggy: Wet look PU leggings, £38

Simple: Chain detail cami, £30

Chic: Cream tailored blazer, £75

On trend: Embroidered PUskirt, £48

Sophisticated: Chain detail cami, £30

Lovely lace: Lace top halter pencil dress, £75

Demure: High neck lace midi dress, £65

Sheer delight: Lace long sleeve shift dress, £55

Embellishment: Long sleeve tribal caviar dress, £65

Biker chic: PU panelled biker jacket, £75

The collection will be a 
nod to each of the sister’s signature style and will 'embrace Kim's 
glamorous vibe, Kourtney's eclectic taste and Khloe's edgy style' with 
sequined biker jackets, tribal embellished crop tops, lace overlay 
jumpsuits and full feather coats.

Kim, in her her first photoshoot 
post-baby, Kourtney and Khloe show no signs of what might be going on 
behind the scenes as they smoulder in the photos, modelling pieces from 
their latest fashion line.

‘With a reputation for distinctive, 
fashion-forward womenswear design, Lipsy provided the perfect retail 
partner for Kourtney, Kim and Khloé who have become worldwide entities, 
recognised for their signature style and desirable wardrobes,’ said a 
spokesman for the brand.

Speaking
about the range, Kourtney said: 'Kim, Khloé and I are always looking 
for new ways to keep our collection unique, and give our fans around the
world fashion-forward pieces.'

'Whether
you are rocking the feathered jacket or one of the leather dresses, 
there are a million ways to style these pieces, all uniquely stylish,' 
added Khloe.

Kim, who 
showcases her new post-baby figure in the shots, said: 'The collection 
is inspired by the stylish women from around the world that I’ve had the
pleasure of meeting. This is for those Lipsy girls who have as much fun
with fashion as I do.'

Edgy: The collection aims to reflect each of the sister's own styles, Khloe, who loves a more edgy look, models the range to perfection

Animal behaviour: Kourtney gives a sexy kick to a leopard print chiffon shirt and black embossed mini-skirt as she showcases her toned physique in the new shots

Hell for leather: Khloe shows no signs of her marital woes and she poses on a chair to showcase the new range for Lipsy London

Sophisticated: The campaign was shot by controversial photographer Terry Richardson and aims to capture the more high-end feel of the collection

Racy lace: Khloe models a revealing black lace dress from the Kardashian Kollection, which will be available in the UK, as well as the Middle East and Russia

The campaign was shot by controversial 
photographer Terry Richardson, who recently came under fire for 
directing Miley Cyrus' salacious Wrecking Ball video.

The Lipsy images are, however, a far cry from Miley’s nude offering and the Kardashian trio look sophisticated and elegant as they model their new range, which launches in the UK on Thursday.

The
Kardashian Kollection for Lipsy will be available in the United 
Kingdom, Ireland, the Middle East and Russia.

British
fans of the famous sisters will be pleased to know that the new 
40-piece range will also be available at Next.co.uk and all 
Nextinternational websites, House of Fraser and Very.co.uk, as well as on Lipsy's own website.

They can't be stopped! The Kardashian sisters are back with a second line for Lipsy London after a stellar first collection in July
