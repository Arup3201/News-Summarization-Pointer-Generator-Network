The mother of a 17-year-old girl who was shot and killed by Colorado police earlier this week is calling for an independent autopsy because she doesn't trust the official investigation 

Laura Sonya Rosales Hernandez made the demand after her daughter Jessica was shot on Monday - the fourth time in seven months a Denver officer fired at a vehicle after perceiving it as a threat.

The request came yesterday as the Denver Police Department and an independent city official who monitors the agency disclosed that separate investigations were underway into policies regarding officers shooting at moving vehicles.

Denver police say Jessica drove a stolen car at two of the department's officers, hitting one of them in the leg

Mrs Hernandez said: 'I want another autopsy on my daughter so we can know how much damage they did.'

'I want to know, how did this happen? I want to know everything.'

She also has five other children, including a four-year-old son, to worry about. 

Police have said the two officers involved in the shooting, Daniel Greene, a 16-year-veteran, and Gabriel Jordan, a nine-year-veteran of the force, fired after Hernandez drove a stolen car into one of them. Jordan suffered a fractured leg.

A passenger in the car disputed that account, saying police opened fire before the vehicle struck the officer. 

Police have admitted no one in the car, which contained five people, was armed. 

Greene and Jordan have been placed on routine administrative leave pending the investigation. 

Hernandez's mother said her daughter made a mistake by 'grabbing' a car that did not belong to her but didn't deserve to pay with her life.

She said: 'How much do they need to investigate?' 

'It's all done. They did it. They killed her. All I want is justice.'

A passenger in the car, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of safety concerns, said Hernandez lost control of the vehicle because she was unconscious after being shot.

The passenger said officers came up to the car from behind and fired four times into the driver's side window as they stood on the side of the car, narrowly missing others inside.

Mrs Hernandez criticized the way police handled her daughter after she was shot.

She said: 'They dragged her on the floor and threw her down like a piece of garbage,'

The shooting occurred amid a national debate about police use of force fueled by racially-charged episodes in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.

Investigators in the Denver case will be relying on witnesses and police accounts because the department has only just started to buy body cameras for its officers and Jordan and Greene were not yet outfitted. 

Denver does not use in-car dashboard cameras.

Prosecutors promised a thorough probe of the shooting as a group of angry protesters demanded swift answers and called for a special prosecutor to investigate the death earlier this week. 

A vigil in the alleyway in which the teenager was shot dead was also held.

The U.S. Supreme Court has held that officers may not use deadly force to stop a fleeing suspect unless the person is believed to pose significant physical harm. 

Policies vary and some departments have banned or discouraged the practice. 

The police department and independent monitor Nicholas Mitchell are both looking at how national standards compare to Denver's policy.

The city currently allows officers to fire at moving cars if they have no other reasonable way to prevent death or serious injury.

Denver's policy urges officers to try to move out of the way rather than fire.

It states: 'An officer threatened by an oncoming vehicle shall, if feasible, move out of the way rather than discharging a firearm.'

Experts say shooting and disabling a driver can send a car out of control.

Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, said: 'If you were to shoot at the driver you would have an unguided missile, basically.'

Candles and bouquets were left near the scene of the fatal police shooting in an alleyway in northeast Denver

Flowers were put out, candles were lit and a rosary was draped over a portrait of Jessica at her home
