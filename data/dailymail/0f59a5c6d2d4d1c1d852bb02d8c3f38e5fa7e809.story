Many men shy away from the yoga studio, dismissing it as 'too feminine and spiritual'.

But a new, 'manlier' form of the exercise loved by Miranda Kerr and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley has  launched to help  men tone up.

Yoga for men is being dubbed 'broga' and a photographer has released a photo series showing tattooed and bearded men practicing the spiritual exercise.

Yoga for men: From downward dog to warrior pose, a new photo series created by a U.S.-based photographer shows  tattooed and bearded men practicing the work-out

Photographer Amy Goalen, 40, from Santa Monica, California, has released her photo project, called Inside the Warrior, in the hope of proving that yoga has changed.  

From downward dog to warrior pose, Amy says that these tattooed and bearded men prove that you don't need to be a spiritual female or a hippy vegetarian to enjoy this activity. 

Making a point: Traditionally seen as an exercise regime for women, photographer Amy Goalen has released the project, which she calls Inside the Warrior, to prove that yoga has changed

Proof: Amy wanted to capture men practicing the gentle work-out to show that it's becoming more and more fashionable among macho men 

Seeing things from a different perspective: The photo series shows macho men doing broga at every opportunity, including in the middle of a busy New York street 

Work out: Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme, says broga's founder

Popular: Clearly popular over in the states, as these images prove, more and more broga studios are opening their doors in the UK, too

And it seems that the exercise is taking off. 'Yoga is not just for girls,' broga's creator Matt Miller, a college American football star turned bodybuilder and nutrition expert, recently told Men's Fitness magazine. 

'Every athlete needs to incorporate elements of stretching and lengthening into their programme.'

Miller learned that the hard way, dealing with injuries from years of running, colliding and lifting that left him with what he calls a 'severely limited' range of motion.

He discovered yoga after signing on as an ambassador with clothing brand Lululemon - and soon started to wonder why he'd never done it before.

Flexible: Experts say that broga can help athletes recover from injuries and boost their range of motion

Strength training: Fitness experts say that certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training

Beneficial: Experts say that broga helps with increased mobility and, as a result, helps men lift heavier weights and boost their work-outs

Combining his studies with his own personal training experience, he created broga, a style designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability.

It's now being taught at locations around southeast England, with more trainers and locations being created on a near-monthly basis.  

Personal trainer Jack Braniff added: 'Broga helps with your mobility, flexibility, strength, core, balance and also an increased blood flow to your muscles, all which can help with weight loss.

Tranquil: Broga was designed to counteract everything from your desk hunch to your sofa-slouch - while emphasising moves that build upper-body strength and stability - and helping you relax

Picturesque: Amy wanted to promote the benefits of broga in her new photoseries of men practicing it in various locations across the U.S. 

'Increased mobility, in particularly hip and shoulder will see a marked improvement in your big lifts, full ROM (range of motion) squats, deadlifts, overhead press etc and especially the Olympic lifts. All tools to get massive.

'Likewise, certain sequences and asanas are great for warm-ups and cool downs before training.

'Pro cycling teams for instance, use sun salutations before their rides, something I also use before my sessions.

'Although the breathing and chanting does have it's place to help calm, you take what you want from yoga, and in my case it's a more structured way to improve my mobility and help with my other gym activities, not to meditate.' 

Professional fans: Pro cycling teams apparently use sun salutations before their rides
