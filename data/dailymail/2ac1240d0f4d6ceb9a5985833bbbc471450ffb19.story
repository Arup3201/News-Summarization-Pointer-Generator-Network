Ministers reacted with fury last night after controversial UN inspector Raquel Rolnik produced a 'misleading Marxist diatribe' condemning the Government's flagship welfare and housing policies.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith described the Brazilian's report – which criticises the so-called 'bedroom tax' and demands better housing for travellers – as 'utterly ridiculous'.

And Housing Minister Kris Hopkins said: 'This partisan report is completely discredited, and it is disappointing that the United Nations has allowed itself to be associated with a misleading Marxist diatribe.'

Miss Rolnik visited Britain last year as the UN's 'special rapporteur' on housing, prompting a storm of controversy.

At
 the end of her trip she voiced concern about housing benefit cuts, 
saying that she was 'shocked to hear how many people feel abused in 
their human rights'.

The UN
 claimed that she had taken advantage of a standing invitation to its 
inspectors to visit and assess the impact of policies in member states.

Conservative
 MP Stewart Jackson branded Miss Rolnik a 'loopy Brazilian Leftie with 
no evidence' who was 'masquerading as a serious UN official'.

And
 critics suggested that she look a bit closer to home – pointing out 
that in Brazil, where she was a housing minister, tens of millions of 
people are condemned to living in shanty towns or favelas.

It
 also emerged that Miss Rolnik had been an avid follower of Candomble, 
an African-Brazilian religion that originated during the slave trade.

Marx when she was studying for her master's degree in architecture, 
according to her sister.

Yesterday
 the UN's high commission for human rights, which is responsible for 
Miss Rolnik, insisted that it had no knowledge of her final report. In 
the document, Miss Rolnik complains about the 'lack of appropriate and 
culturally adequate residential and transit accommodation' for 
travellers.

She also 
expresses concern about cuts to council tax benefit, the housing benefit
 cap and the 'bedroom tax' which will see working-age claimants with 
more bedrooms than they require get their handouts reduced.

The
 Government, which estimates that the average affected household will 
lose £14 a week, says the policy will save taxpayers £500million a year.

It will also encourage 
people to move and free up larger properties, helping families currently
 crammed into homes that are too small.

Miss
 Rolnik admitted that 'in principle the policy does not force people to 
move' but claimed that it has left 'many people' in 'tremendous 
despair'.

The report 
concludes: 'The removal of the spare room subsidy should be suspended 
immediately – and fully re-evaluated in light of the evidence of its 
negative impacts on the right to adequate housing and the general 
well-being of many vulnerable individuals and households.'

Mr
 Duncan Smith said the report was 'biased, poorly researched and 
contains inaccuracies the author refused to correct even when they were 
pointed out to her'.

He 
claimed Miss Rolnik had failed to change several mistakes in her report,
 including a reference to 'increasing unemployment', adding: 'I welcome 
scrutiny of all our welfare reforms, but this report is utterly 
ridiculous.

'It's frankly 
staggering that someone operating in the name of the UN doesn't appear 
to realise that unemployment is falling in the UK, not increasing.

'We
 have one of the most generous housing safety nets in the western world,
 and I would respectfully suggest Miss Rolnik could find another more 
pressing international issue to turn her attention to.'

Miss
 Rolnik said that she would not be making any further comment on the 
report or on her findings until next month, when she claims the document
 is due to be discussed with the Human Rights Council in New York.
