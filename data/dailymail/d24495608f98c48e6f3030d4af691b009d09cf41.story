When Botox became available as a beauty treatment six years ago it was hailed by many as nothing short of a miracle.

A-listers
 such as Simon Cowell, Nicole Kidman and Sharon Osbourne have all admitted 
to trying the popular treatment that promises to turn back time in just 
one session.

But no matter how safe Botox claims to be, the thought of having purified botulinum toxin injected into your face isn't exactly tempting.

Now one revolutionary new product claims to be a no-toxin alternative that will freeze your wrinkles away instantly.

Frotox: Hailed as the next generation Botox, a new procedure called iovera promises to freeze away wrinkles

iovera, or ‘Frotox’ as it has been 
nicknamed, is a toxin free wrinkle treatment designed to deliver 
immediate results with nothing left behind in the body. 

Developed by a California-based medical technology group called myoscience, it temporarily treats horizontal and vertical forehead lines and wrinkles by administering two cold 'shots' into each temple.

The treatment, which has been hailed the next generation of Botox, uses a technique called 
cryoneuromodulation to banish fine lines and now it is available in the UK for the first time at a Harley Street clinic.

The 15-minute procedure involves placing
 a device filled with liquid nitrogen next to the nerves that control 
the muscles that cause wrinkles.

An intense cold shock puts the nerve into ‘hibernation’ for up to four months, so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear.

It
 claims to be the perfect answer for needle-phobes due to its quick 
procedure and the fact that only a closed-end needle is used, and 
patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than 
cold or pain.

It also maintains that it can target 
nerves very precisely which means expressive muscles can still move to 
make facial expressions

Big claims: Frotox claims to be the perfect answer for needle-phobes due to its quick procedure and patients are said to experience the feeling as pressure rather than cold or pain.

‘The liquid nitrogen freezes the 
targeted nerves on the forehead and between the brows,’ says Harley 
Street plastic surgeon Dr Yannis Alexandrides, who has been trialling 
and refining the procedure developed by  the California-based lab for more than a year.

‘This puts the nerves into temporary hibernation, so muscles relax and wrinkles disappear.

‘Unlike Botox, which takes four days to 
work, the effects can be seen immediately and last for up to four 
months.

And as nitrogen occurs naturally in the body - unlike Botox - 
you aren’t putting a foreign substance in to your system.’

But does it actually work?

ioverao uses Focused Cold Therapy which uses the power of cold for the application to precise targets.

Highly pressurised liquid nitrous oxide (liquid cold) travels at very high speeds down a fine 27G closed-end needle. 

At the needle tip it changes phase into gaseous form which draws in heat energy from the surrounding tissue to form a precise zone of cold. 

Initial trials showed that all testers had fewer wrinkles after treatment.

Dr.
 Raina Zarb Adami, from Aesthetic Virtue, Harley Street, said: 'The 
effect is immediate but you can’t grade the response as far as I know.

'To
 my knowledge it is been used mainly in forehead lines with the entry 
point close to the temple. It certainly looks promising.'

Dr. Vincent Wong, Advanced Medical Aesthetics Practitioner & Aesthetic Medicine Trainer, who also carries out the procedure added: 'Iovera is the world's first toxin-free anti-wrinkle treatment - It's a unique stand-alone treatment in its own right and shouldn't be compared side-by-side with Botox or any botulinum toxins.

'Instead, we should think of it as an additional option available to people, especially those who do not want botulinum toxin injections or cannot have them due to medical reasons.'

However, youth doesn't come cheap and while Frotox differs from Botox in many ways, they have similar price tags.

A 15-minute session will set you back £300.

And while the beauty world is buzzing about the latest anti-ageing procedure, not everyone is convinced.Dr Dennis Wolf, Joint Medical Director at The Private Clinic on Harley Street, said: 'Cryotherapy, which is what so called Frotox is, is where you freeze the nerves in the face in an effort to remove wrinkles.

'There is some degree of uncertainty with this procedure, as it is delivered in the hope that the right nerves can be hit to achieve the desired result. In my opinion the procedure is, therefore, far less predictable than Botox.

'Botox has been around for more than 30 years so medical practitioners, as well as most consumers, are aware that it is a safe and effective method.

'We are also aware of the potential side effects involved in its administration. It is my opinion that more studies into the long term effects and potential benefits of Frotox are needed before we can consider this a safe, viable alternative to Botox.

'Botox remains the best option to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles – it is predictable, safe and repeatable.'
