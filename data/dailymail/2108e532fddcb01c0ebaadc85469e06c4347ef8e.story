Court: MIND director Nicholas Pennell stalked the woman for three months by following her in his white Audi, a court heard

A director of the mental health charity Mind stalked a woman he had met only once by following her in his white Audi for three months, a court heard.

Nicholas Pennell, 62, followed the pretty 29-year-old woman on her way home from work three times a week, slowing down to see her and driving back to look at her again once he had passed.

Pennell, who has resigned from his position at the charity, described the victim as 'charming and pleasant' after meeting her at her place of work.

The woman began noticing the man's white Audi as she walked home from a park and ride near Plymouth, Devon.

After changing her route home, Pennell continued to follow the woman who was also described as 'attentive and enchanting'.

The victim noted the car's registration number and reported it to police after saying the ordeal was 'ruining the quality of her life'.

Plymouth Crown Court heard Pennell was 'smitten' with the woman, but had no intentions of making contact with her. 

The 62-year-old said his work was stressful but sometimes boring, and he began 
stalking her to 'brighten up his day' even though he knew it was 
inappropriate.

His lawyer Gareth Richardson told the court: 'He found her a very attentive, enchanting woman and became obsessed.

'He is mortified she was so adversely affected.'

Pennell from Tavistock, Devon was chief executive of Plymouth and District Mind until his arrest in September.

He admitted he had been following the victim for three months, but denied slowing down when he passed her in his car.

The court heard how the defendant was 'relieved' to have been arrested as 'it had become an obsession'.

Plymouth Crown Court heard how the man became infatuated with the victim he found to be 'enchanting and attentive'

Mr Richardson said the man was receiving therapy and counselling, adding: 'He is still struggling to come to terms with this.'

Judge Geoffrey Mercer said: 'He was infatuated. I am prepared to accept that you had no sinister intent towards this woman.

'You developed an infatuation to the extent of an obsession. It frightened her and caused her real distress.'

He was given a community order to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work, pay £1,030 court costs and a token £200 compensation to the victim.

A restraining order banning him from any contact was made without time limit.

Pennell said afterwards: 'I am still shaking, I regret what has happened.

'I tendered my resignation which was accepted.'
