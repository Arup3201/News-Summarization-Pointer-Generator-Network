A foreign exchange student at a prestigious university told a court she was treated like a servant by the school's dean - and said nothing because she feared her scholarship would be taken away.

Peiyi (Tracy) Gan, a Chinese national, did laundry, cooked and cleaned for Dr Cecelia Chang who was dean of the Asian Studies Center at St John's University.

Chang, 57, has been accused of embezzling more than $1 million from the university and using students as her personal servants.

Miss Gan said that she acted as a maid for Chang and her family at their home in Jamaica 
Estates, Queens, New York and often endured verbal abuse from Chang's son Steven. 

She was also required to hand-wash the disgraced university dean's underwear.

Miss Gan testimony was heard in court on Monday via videotape as she returned to China on September 21.

'Servant': Peiyi Gan was worried she would lose her scholarship if she didn't comply with the dean's demands

Under the scholarship program at St John's, students are required to give 20-hours service to the school each week. 

Miss Gan, now 31, had come to the U.S. to study in 2004 - and began working for Chang seven days a week.

She continued for four years until she had completed her Master's degree.

As well as taking out the trash and mopping floors, the young woman cooked for the family - who often insulted her meals.

Miss Gan was also forced to create 
fake financial statements allowing the disgraced dean to claim thousands
of dollars from the school, according to the New York Post.

In
2010, Change was charged with forced labor after she allegedly told 
students they would lose their scholarships unless they worked for her.

Prosecutors
at the Brooklyn court said that Chang stole from the university to pay 
off gambling debts at casinos in Atlantic City and Connecticut.
