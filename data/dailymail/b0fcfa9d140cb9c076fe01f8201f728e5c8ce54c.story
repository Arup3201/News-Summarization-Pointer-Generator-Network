It's the day that every child hates but not even princesses of Spain can avoid the dreaded first day back at school after the summer.

Luckily for Leonor, Princess of Asturias and her sister Infanta Sof√≠a, their mother Queen Letizia and father King Felipe came along to hold their hands.

Letizia, 41, was every inch the yummy mummy as she swept into the school in a simple grey t-shirt and with her face scrubbed clean of make-up.

Hot fuzz: A dapper King Felipe smarted up in a shirt and tie but kept his salt-and-pepper holiday beard

Husband Felipe, meanwhile, opted for a smart shirt and tie, although kept his salt-and-pepper flecked holiday beard in place.

The two girls, aged eight and seven, both go to the same school, Santa Maria de los Rosales in Madrid, which their father also attended as a boy.

Driven to the school by their parents, the girls were escorted up the steps to start the new term before the royal couple emerged wreathed in smiles.

Their own new term had begun on Monday, with a state visit from the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and his wife Lorena Castillo.

Job done: The royal couple emerged smiling after dropping their two girls off at school in Madrid

After welcoming the presidential couple to the Zarzuela Palace in Madrid, the couple spent the rest of the week enjoying a last few days of holiday time with their daughters, although Letizia twice emerged for charity engagements.

On Tuesday, the Queen hosted Ana Mato, the minister of health, social services and equality, and Ana Pastor, the minister for public works, at the palace for a meeting of the Royal Board for Disability, before meeting campaigners from a child protection charity two days later.

The ever-stylish royal kept it businesslike on both occasions, opting for a neat black pencil skirt and cream jacket for the first event and an elegant black and white striped skirt and a crisp shirt for the second.

For her first school run of the new academic year, the Spanish yummy mummy plumped for a simple pair of jeans, a grey t-shirt emblazoned with a heart print and a loose, un-brushed hair.

Schedule: The couple have a busy new term of their own, with a visit to New York later this month

The two girls, meanwhile, looked ready for action with their long, blonde hair neatly plaited and perfectly-pressed school blazers.

With their daughters now back at school, the Spanish royal couple have an intense schedule of meetings, visits and events to contend with over the next month.

The highlight, though, will be a trip to New York at the end of the month, where King Felipe will address the UN General Assembly in a bid to secure one of the non-permanent seats on the Security Council for Spain.
