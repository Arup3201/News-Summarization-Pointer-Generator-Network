A disheveled and puffy-eyed Robert Hughes has been convicted on a tenth child sex offence on his second and final day in court of jury decisions.

Brought into Sydney's Downing Centre District Court by prison officers, 65-year-old Hughes looked teary but managed to mouth 'I'm OK' from the dock to his wife.

Celebrity agent Robyn Gardiner asked for a vacant seat in the public gallery so she could be closer to her husband during the jury's verdict on the final two of 11 child sex charges.

The jury convicted Hughes on Monday of nine offences, returning on Tuesday after agreeing on just one of the remaining charges. They found Hughes guilty of committing an act of indecency towards a child.

The jury was discharged after not being able to reach a verdict on the charge of inciting a 15-year-old to commit an act of indecency in 1988.

Ms Gardiner approached her husband in the dock and whispered to him before kissing Hughes, as two prison officers stood behind him.

And on Tuesday night the Nine Network revealed that the other members of the Hey Dad! cast - Julie McGregor, Christopher Mayer, Christopher Truswell, Simone Buchanan and Sarah Monahan - would appear on A Current Affair on Wednesday night.

The network would not reveal what Hughes's former colleagues were prepared to say on the show.

Hughes' court appearance came after his first night in Australia's largest maximum security prison tonight.

Hughes, 65, was taken to the Silverwater Remand and Reception Centre in Sydney's western suburbs on Monday afternoon following his conviction for nine child sexual assault charges brought against him.

The Hey Dad! star was handcuffed and driven from a central Sydney court in a prison van to the jail, where he was subject to standard procedure when entering a prison - strip-searched, photographed, and relieved of all personal belongings except his wedding ring and clothed in a green prison tracksuit and a pair of white sandshoes.

Hughes has now been found guilty of ten child sex offences, including two counts of sexual assault and seven counts of indecent assault against three women, who were aged between seven and 15 when the assaults took place.

Hughes, pictured arriving at Downing Centre Local Court in March, was convicted of 10 child sex offences  committed between 1983 and 1991

After being found guilty of the first few offenses, Hughes began crying in the dock while shaking his head and repeating 'no, no', reported the Sydney Morning Herald.

Following the verdict on nine charges, Hughes stood up in the court room and yelled 'I am innocent!'

Hughes was accused of a number of molesting three girls aged from six or seven up to 15 years, between 1983 and 1991.

The trial took almost six weeks to come to a verdict, with Hughes pleading not guilty to all 11 charges against him regarding indecent and sexual assault.

The court heard testimonies from former childhood friends of Hughes' daughter, Jessica Hughes, who gave evidence in support of her father at the trial.

Two women said Hughes had entered their rooms naked during sleepovers with his daughter, and exposed himself or sexually assaulted them as they lay in bed.

Another woman recalled a trip to Manly in which Mr Hughes exposed himself to her while forcing her her to swim between his legs and trapping her there.

Former colleagues who worked on set with the former Hey Dad! star also gave evidence at the trial, testifying that Hughes would repeatedly expose himself and, in one case, tried to grope them.

Hughes denied all the allegations.

The court proceedings took place in Sydney after Hughes was arrested and extradited from London after a two-year police investigation into the accusations.
