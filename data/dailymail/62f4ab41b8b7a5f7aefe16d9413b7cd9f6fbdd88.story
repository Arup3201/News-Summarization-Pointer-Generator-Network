The Big Bang Theory star Mayim Bialik, 38, is a fan of Attachment Parenting, which sees parents sleep in the same bed as their children and carry their offspring in a sling for most of the day

She’s known to TV fans as neuroscientist Amy in cult US comedy series The Big Bang Theory – but actress Mayim Bialik has a big controversial theory that she espouses in her private life.

The 38-year-old mother of two is a fan of Attachment Parenting, a philosophy that encourages ‘co-sleeping’ and ‘baby wearing’. 

Co-sleepers like to share the same bed as their children, while baby wearers carry their offspring in a sling close to their body for most of the day. 

Mayim, who has sons aged nine and six, reveals in a new book that she breast-fed them until they were four and two respectively.

She says parenting should be instinctive. ‘Hundreds of thousands of years of evolution have prepared all of us, should we so choose, to be a good parent. The knowledge we need is programmed into our DNA.’

Mayim, who qualified as a neuroscientist in 2008, sets out her guide to parenting in new book Beyond The Sling: A Real Life Guide To Raising Confident, Loving Children The Attachment Parenting Way.

Don’t cancel your gym membership just yet if you want a good night’s sleep: That’s the message behind a new study which has found a link between fitness levels and sleeping problems.

The research involved more than 8,000 men and women who were tested for their cardio-respiratory fitness when walking or running on a treadmill in four clinic visits every two years.

Those participants who had let their fitness slide and were no longer able to exercise for as long on the treadmill were more likely to have trouble sleeping.

The data from the study, carried out at the University of Georgia, showed that the number of complaints about sleep quality rose by about eight per cent for each minute’s decrease in treadmill endurance.

A new colonoscope that offers surgeons a much better view inside the large intestine could improve detection rates for colorectal cancers.

Most colonoscopes used in standard cancer screening tests are in the form of a forward-only viewing device that has a 170-degree field of view.

These have proved to be successful but the relatively limited viewing angle means some cancerous growths could be missed.

The new device, called a Full Spectrum Endoscopy system, uses three cameras on the front and side of a flexible arm which gives a 330-degree view of the colon walls.

In one study in Israel, where the technology was developed, it was shown to have a ‘miss rate’ of just eight per cent for adenomas – the polyps which can turn into cancer – compared with a 42 per cent miss rate for the traditional design.

Jack Wilshere has taken part in the Uppies for Autism challenge, inviting David Beckham and Olympian Mo Farah to join in with the charity campaign

In the wake of the ice bucket challenge and the no make-up selfie, the latest charity campaign hoping to capture the public’s imagination is the football-themed Uppies For Autism.

Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere has already taken part, trying to keep up the ball for as long as possible using feet, knees, head and shoulders (but no hands, obviously).

Wilshere has now challenged David Beckham and Olympic champion Mo Farah to have a turn. 

Initiated by The Autism Trust, the campaign is aimed at raising awareness of the challenges faced by those with autism – a neuro-developmental condition which affects a person’s ability to relate to others and how they process information about the world around them. 

Participants are sharing videos on Facebook and Twitter with the hashtag #uppiesforautism.
