Berkshire Hathaway has offered the best hint yet as to who will succeed Warren Buffett at the helm of the massively successful conglomerate.

And Buffett, world's most successful investor who grew the company from a failing manufacturing firm into a $485billion behemoth, says his replacement will be an even better leader than he has been.

The 84-year-old released an annual letter to investors on Saturday in which he discussed his successors and the future of the company that he has run for 50 years.

'Both the board and I believe we now have the right person to succeed me as CEO - a successor ready to assume the job the day after I die or step down,' the billionaire said in his letter to Berkshire shareholders.

'In certain important respects, this person will do a better job than I am doing,' Buffett added.

Vice chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett's longtime business partner, gave more details than ever about a potential Buffett's heir - and even named the top candidates. 

Munger, 91, characterized two top Berkshire executives, Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, as 'proven performers who would probably be under-described as "world-class,"' in his annual letter to shareholders. 

Abel, 52, leads Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and Jain, 63, has been Buffett's top insurance deputy for three decades.

In previous annual letters, Buffett has said that Berkshire's board had been fully aware of his chosen successor but he kept his options open for other possible candidates.

He didn't name his eventual successor in this year's note to investigors, but he did discuss the qualities that person will need.

'My successor will need one other particular strength: the ability to fight off the ABCs of business decay, which are arrogance, bureaucracy and complacency,' Buffett said. 'When these corporate cancers metastasize, even the strongest of companies can falter.' 

Investors have long speculated about who would, or could, succeed Buffett, particularly after he was diagnosed with and then beat prostate cancer in 2012.

Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charles Munger, 91, hinted at the idea that Warren Buffett's successor could be Greg Abel or Ajit Jain, both executives within the company

Neither Buffett's nor Munger's letter referred by name to Matthew Rose, executive chairman of the BNSF railroad unit, who has also been mentioned by investors as a possible successor.

In Saturday's letter, Buffett strongly suggested that the potential successor already works within Berkshire.

Analysts and Berkshire shareholders have speculated that Jain would succeed Buffett as CEO, according to the Wall Street Journal. 

Both he and Abel are longtime executives with the company. Jain has been with Berkshire since 1985, while Abel joined the company in 2000. 

Buffett has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a failing textile company into a conglomerate with a $363billion market value, and more than 80 operating businesses in such areas as insurance, railroads, energy, food and apparel.

The Omaha, Nebraska-based company also has well over $100billion of common stock investments.

'Our directors believe that our future CEOs should come from internal candidates whom the Berkshire board has grown to know well,' he wrote.

Age will also be a factor and Buffett said Berkshire may be best off if his successor stays on for at least a decade.

'Our directors also believe that an incoming CEO should be relatively young, so that he or she can have a long run in the job,' Buffett wrote. 'It's hard to teach a new dog old tricks. And they are not likely to retire at 65 either - or have you noticed?'
