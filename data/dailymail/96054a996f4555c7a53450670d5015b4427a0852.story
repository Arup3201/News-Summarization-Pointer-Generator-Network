The 168th Manchester derby is looming on Sunday and the match has gained added importance for Manuel Pellegrini’s men.

By their high standards, Manchester City have slipped into slumber over the last three games with two losses and a draw characterised by unimaginative, jaded displays from their most important players.

A 2-0 defeat at the hands of Newcastle United to send them out of the League Cup alone would have been enough to cast a shadow over Pellegrini’s week, but it followed a lacklustre Premier League defeat at West Ham and a stuttering Champions League stalemate with CSKA Moscow.

It is fair to say the Chilean is in the midst of the most trying week of his City career so far, with City in danger of going out of the Champions League and at risk of repeating their doomed title defence of 2012-13.

He must arrest the slide on Sunday if they are to keep Chelsea in their sights. Here are five items in Pellegrini's in-tray at the moment.

The defence is still a cause for concern

Pellegrini said the team had been working on its defence before the Newcastle game but there was scant evidence of that as Alan Pardew’s side, largely without the world class talent of City, were allowed too much time and space to make their breakthroughs.

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce fired the warning shots at the weekend when he pinpointed City new boy Eliaquim Mangala as one of the weaknesses his side exploited last week.

The 23-year-old, bought for £32m in the summer, has failed to justify his price tag so far but Pellegrini suggested he was being scapegoated in the same way as Martin Demichelis was last year.

The City manager will hope Mangala can emulate the Argentine by turning his career at the Etihad around in a similar fashion.

Injuries are in danger of derailing progress 

Pellegrini’s decision to field a strong starting XI in the League Cup, the competition which gave him his first silverware in England, is laudable.

But the sight of playmaker David Silva limping off after eight minutes, with a derby four days away, suggested it had perhaps been ill advised. The Spaniard is a vital cog in the City side and a game changing talent.

Silva's injury presents another headache for Pellegrini ahead of Sunday's clash with United 

Pellegrini might have been better off resting him in midweek, having played against West Ham just four days previously. City will receive news about Silva’s knee injury on Thursday and will be hoping for a positive report.

Yaya Toure also exited lamely after an hour last night with a groin strain, although Pellegrini said that was merely precautionary.

City are a team struggling for confidence 

The current run of results - draw-loss-loss - would not be viewed as a mini crisis at most other clubs but this is is a side that has become accustomed to victory. 

They have won just six of 15 games in all competitions this season and are now on a three-match winless run for the second time in a season that is less than three months old.

Pellegrini conceded that his players were low on confidence and suffering from a ‘lack of trust’. With the defence leaking goals and attacking players not capitalising on chances, the confidence problem will only intensify if they fail to get a result against United.

Just what has happened to Yaya Toure? 

Last season he was the driving force at the Etihad, dominating with his trademark runs down the centre of the pitch and leading by example. 

There have been glimpses of his greatness this season, too, but he has been largely ineffectual, lacking sharpness, being outmuscled by his opponents and occasionally looking disinterested. 

He has scored only one goal - an impressive strike against Aston Villa and even then he was poor for the rest of the game.

If he doesn't start improving soon he'll be lucky to get a birthday card, never mind a cake from City.

City are growing a reputation for being a lousy cup team

Manchester City have a proud and rich history in the cups, with their first FA Cup trophy dating back to 1904. They have had success recently, too, winning the FA Cup in 2011, the Community Shield in 2012 and lifting the League Cup earlier this year.

Pellegrini clearly values them, too, consistently fielding strong teams. But for some reason, they just can’t find their feet this season. Including the Community Shield, they have one just one of six cup games and that was against Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.

Pellegrini has inspired City to reverse their form before, encouraging his side to magnificently catch and overhaul Liverpool in last season’s title race. 

His side showed real character and focus to hunt down Liverpool and secure the title on the final day of the season, meaning he had a League-cup double to show for his first season in charge.
