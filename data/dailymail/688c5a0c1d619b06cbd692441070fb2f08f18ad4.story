A young woman who lost a foot and several fingers to a flesh-eating bacteria could hardly believe it when she was able to speak on Sunday for the first time since she was taken to a Georgia hospital more than three weeks ago.

‘Hello. Whoa. Wow, my mind is blown,’ were Aimee Copeland's first words addressed to her sister and mother, according to her father, Andy Copeland.

Mr Copeland was in church at the time and had to wait until Sunday evening to hear his daughter's voice.

When her father finally got into Copeland's room around 5pm, he asked her how she felt. He said he was thrilled to hear her respond, ‘It feels weird being able to talk.’

Thrilled: Aimee, left with mother Donna, father Andy and sister Paige, has delighted her family by speaking for the first time since her shocking extreme surgery

The 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate developed a rare condition called necrotizing fasciitis after cutting her leg in a May 1 fall from a homemade zip line over a west Georgia river. Her left leg, other foot and both hands have been amputated.

Copeland began breathing on her own early last week and the ventilator was wheeled out of her room on Thursday, the same day she was able to sit up in a chair on her own. She no longer has tubes in her nose and is down to three IVs from an initial 12, her father said.

She also is finally able to eat soft foods. A vegetarian, she had a tall breakfast order for her mother on Monday: veggie sausage, a biscuit, white gravy, a fried egg over easy and fresh fruit.

'She'll probably eat one bite,' said Copeland's mother, Donna. ‘But sure I'm going to make it. What mother wouldn't make it?’

Andy Copeland described his daughter’s newly regained voice as weak and raspy, but said that she already has been joking with family, talking about her life at the hospital and asking what everyone else has been up to.

In silence: Miss Copeland had been unable to speak because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her

Copeland had to have most of her left leg, hands and right foot amputated at Augusta Hospital, Georgia, and doctors thought she had only a slim chance of surviving the aggressive infection.

She had been unable to speak until Sunday because of her breathing tube in her throat, and her parents had learned to read lips to communicate with her.

Miss Copeland has improved incredibly rapidly with the support of her family and well-wishers who have made donations on the website Mr Copeland set up for his brave daughter.

She was able to ask for ice-cream, and let her family know when she was bored and wanted a book to read.

Miss Copeland suffered a deep gash in her leg after falling from the zip line over a Georgia river, and the bacteria took hold in the wound.

Doctors at the local emergency room in Carrollton closed the wound with nearly two dozen staples, but it became infected within days.

On May 4, she was diagnosed with the rare infection and flown 200 miles to Augusta for treatment by specialists at Doctors Hospital.

Prayers: Aimee Copeland's father has said the progress she has made after contracting the aggressive virus was a 'miracle'

The flesh-eating bacteria, Aeromonas hydrophila, emit toxins that cut off blood flow to parts of the body. The affliction can destroy muscle, fat and skin tissue.

Only a fortnight ago, doctors gave her little chance of survival, but she became increasingly alert, despite several major operations. Now she has spoken for the first time, although she is likely to remain in hospital for several months.

'This doctor can't fathom a reason for why she's improved the way she has,' Mr Copeland said. 'Her spirits are extraordinarily high. I am absolutely amazed.

A week ago, Mr Copeland revealed that his daughter was breathing on her own, as she was taken off her ventilator for several hours.

She surprised doctors by sitting for five hours on Tuesday, after nurses thought she would only be able to sit up for an hour.

Aimee 'is breathing completely on her own! How cool is that?' he wrote on his blog.

Miss Copeland's amazing recovery has brought support from all over the world and her father had said how grateful he is for the outpouring of concern from across the world.

'The level of prayer and support has been phenomenal and we intend to read every card and send thank you cards for every gift,' he wrote after she began breathing independently.

Stoic: Aimee Copeland has now been removed from a ventilator at the Georgia hospital after contracting a flesh-eating bacteria

'Aimee is being Aimee. She's cracking jokes, speaking frankly, displaying her usual early morning grumpiness and she has been off of the ventilator for over 10 hours.'

When Miss Copeland learned she would lose her hands and remaining foot on May 19, she responded by saying: 'Let's do this.'

Mr Copeland wrote about the difficult talk he had a day earlier with his daughter after she contracted the condition.

He said she 'shed no tears, she never batted an eyelash. I was crying because I am a proud father of an incredibly courageous young lady', Andy Copeland wrote.

He said he was finally able to tell his daughter after she began communicating what had happened since that outing, and how she's been the focus of an outpouring of love from around the world.

'We told her that the world loved and admired her,' he wrote. 'We explained that she had become a symbol of hope, love and faith.'

Difficult times: Miss Copeland was only given a small chance of survival as she battled the infection

He recalled how Aimee's eyes widened and her jaw dropped. Then, Mr Copeland took his daughter's hands and held them up to her face.

'She didn't draw back in horror. She knew the condition she was in,' he wrote.

He explained that doctors believed her hands were hampering her progress, and they must be removed. Aimee nodded, her father said.

'She smiled and raised her hands up, carefully examining them,' her father wrote.

'She then looked at us. We all understood her next three words - "Let's do this".'

Doctors had hoped they would be able to save her remaining foot after two days of treatment using a hyperbaric chamber, in which patients breathe pure oxygen to boost white blood cells and accelerate healing.

Cherished: Miss Copeland, a 24-year-old graduate from Georgia, has fun with friends

He said the family also wanted to make sure a hospital counsellor was available to help Miss Copeland once she was informed of her condition.

Losing a limb is extremely difficult emotionally, and can be particularly difficult for young people, said Dr Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Grady Hospital in Atlanta.

'There is a process that they go through, a grief process,' said Dr Kaslow, who is not involved in Miss Copeland's care.

'There is shock, disbelief, anger, sadness and then a period of reconciling one to the situation and healing and figuring out how they are going to move forward in their life.'

Miss Copeland's father said she faces a long recovery not just from her amputation but also from kidney failure and other organ damage caused by the infection.

'She's going to be here for months,' he said. 'She's going to need to regrow skin that was removed. She's going to need to learn to use prosthetics. She's going to still be on dialysis for a while.'

Fun loving: Aimee's father, Andy, says describes her as 'outdoorsy' and a 'lover of people'

Necrotizing fasciitis, more commonly known as 'flesh-eating disease', is a rare but extremely vicious bacterial infection. 'Necrotizing' refers to something that causes body tissue to die, and the infection can destroy skin, muscles and fat.

The disease develops when the bacteria enters the body, often through a minor cut or scrape. As the bacteria multiply, they release toxins that kill tissue and cut off blood flow to the area.

Because it is so virulent, the bacteria spreads rapidly throughout the body.

Symptoms include small, red lumps or bumps on the skin, rapidly-spreading bruising, sweating, chills, fever and nausea. Organ failure and shock are also common complications.

Sufferers must be treated immediately to prevent death, and are usually given powerful antibiotics and surgery to remove dead tissue. Amputation can become necessary if the disease spreads through an arm or leg.

Patients may undergo skin grafts after the infection has cleared up, to help the healing process or for aesthetic reasons.
