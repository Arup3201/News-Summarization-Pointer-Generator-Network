An incredible country estate with a 38-bedroom main house, its own loch, a golf course and 19 other homes has been put on the market for £6million.

The Dall Estate, in the Scottish Highlands, was earmarked to become the world's most expensive private members club, with annual fees of £2million, and was dubbed the 'Monaco of The Glen'.

But planning permission was rejected and the owner, Malcolm James, decided to continue to use it as a family home.

He has now put the mammoth estate on the market for 'in excess of £6 million', the same as several three-bedroom flats in Mayfair and significantly less that a £6.6million one-bedroom flat in Kightsbridge which went on sale last month. 

The Dall Estate is bigger than many villages - and comes with Dall House, its own loch, an assault course, an old golf course, a boat shed, a boat house, dormitories and 19 additional homes.

There are labs, a hydro power station and even an indoor sports centre with its own five-a-side football pitch on the estate - which dates back to 1346 and is located on the south shore of Loch Rannoch in Highland Perthshire.

The sprawling property is dominated by the 38-bedroom main home and whoever takes over the estate gets riparian rights on the loch.

The owner is Malcolm James, a secretive Cornishman who made his millions in property speculation. He bought the property for around £1.3million in 2002.

Mr James bought the estate in 2003. It had previously been Rannoch School, whose former pupils include the current Earl of Cardigan.

The Dall Estate, now on the market for £6million, was previously Rannoch School - until the institution closed in 2002.

The school was founded in 1959 and was immediately welcomed as the perfect private school environment for a robust regime of outdoor pursuits.

Pupils flocked to the remote surroundings with its beautiful lochside setting.

But by 1999, many parents were questioning the value of a boarding school education and the only private schools that were flourishing were those that could guarantee top grades and a ready supply of day pupils.

Rannoch performed averagely in exams and was seen as too remote by most parents. 

From a high of around 300 pupils, by 2001 the school roll had declined to just 140. 

But the private school, opened in 1959, was forced to close in 2002 due to falling numbers and insurmountable debts.

The businessman had hoped to turn Dall Estate into a playground for billionaires and, in 2009, unveiled ambitious plans for the ultimate private members club.

He wanted to charge people £2million per year to be a member, leading to the proposed site being dubbed the 'Monaco of the Glen'.

The entrepreneur boasted about how Tiger Woods wouldn't be able to afford to be a member, but he would be allowed to use the golf course 'as a guest'.

But there were a number of protests and Perth and Kinross Council voted against the plans.

Mr James uses the main mansion as his private home but has now instructed Asset Properties to sell the entire estate for more than £6million.

Kyle Cockburn, boss of Asset Properties, today described it as 'a really special place with fantastic history'.

He said: 'A clan seat estate is a very rare thing and I hope someone spots its potential as a corporate retreat or a hotel.

'Now the referendum has been decided it is time to find it a new owner. We have interest from all over the world and finding a buyer is very much what I aim to do.

'It is likely to attract wealthy hoteliers from China but it would also be an ideal billionaire's retreat. The estate has so much. It practically has the services you would find in a small town.

'There is the old golf course, curling rink, chapel, sports centre, hydro station and even a small library.'

The estate lies on the edge of the ancient Black Wood of Rannoch, which is one of the largest remnants of ice age forests in Scotland.

It is set in grounds of approximately 90 acres, which contain many mature specimens of trees, including giant American Red Woods, and abundant wildlife.

The house was commissioned by Clan Chief George Duncan Robertson and built by the renowned architect Thomas Mackenzie, who was responsible for Aldourie Castle (1853), famous for being where the Loch Ness Monster was first seen.

Dall House was the only home he designed and built himself from scratch in the Scots Baronial style, known for its 16th Century features, including turrets.

The house, which is B-Listed, retains many original Victorian features including the magnificently wood panelled hallways, staircases and reception rooms.
