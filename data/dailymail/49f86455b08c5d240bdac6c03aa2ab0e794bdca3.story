Crackdown: The new powers have been billed by Michael Gove, the Education Secretary as 'zero tolerance

Powers to make it easier for head teachers in England to sack under performing staff are to be introduced this week.

They have been billed by Michael Gove, the Education Secretary as 'zero tolerance.'

Ofsted will be harsher in new rules will come into 
from tomorrow.

The procedure for dealing with under performing teachers will be 'simplified' and given a shorter minimum timeframe.

It says in straightforward cases, the process could be completed in nine weeks as opposed to a year - under new 'capability' procedures.

Only a 
handful of teachers have been struck off for incompetence over the past 
decade, suggesting it is all but impossible to get thrown out of the 
profession.

Between 2001 and 2011, just 17 of 
England’s 400,000 teachers were prevented from applying for another job 
after being judged incompetent by the General Teaching Council for 
England.

A three hour a year limit on the 
amount of time head teachers could spend observing a teacher’s lessons 
has also been scrapped, allowing them to go in to classrooms as often as
they like to root out low quality teaching.

But Mr Gove is introducing a requirement for teachers to be assessed every year against news standards allowing head teachers to monitor lessons as as much as they feel is necessary.

Earlier this year Mr Gove vowed to crack down on what he called the ‘dance of the lemons’, where failed teachers turn up at a new school and get a job by presenting well at an interview.

‘It is only after a term or two the head recognises they have taken on a lemon,’ he added. If you are applying for a job when you’ve been subject to capability procedures, you’ll have to say so under new legislation.

‘The single most important thing in a child’s performance is the quality of the teacher. Making sure a child spends the maximum amount of time with inspirational teachers is the most important thing.

‘The evidence is quite clear: if you’re with a bad teacher, you can go back a year; if you’re with a good teacher you can leap ahead a year.’

The Sunday Telegraph reported that out of the 5,000 schools inspected last year, 36 per cent of primary schools and 34 per cent of secondaries were deemed 'satisfactory” or below.

The quality of teaching was not good enough in 38 per cent and poor in 3 per cent.

Primary school children will be required to read to inspectors in a shakeup of the Ofsted regime, to ensure by the time they reach secondary school their reading level will be satisfactory.

Kevin Courtney, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, told the newspaper: 'No other profession would accept this level of scrutiny and mistrust.

When news of the crackdown surfaced earlier this year  Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, the largest teaching union, said: ‘This is yet another depressingly predictable announcement from a Government seemingly intent on destroying the teaching profession and state education.

‘The draconian measures announced today are totally unnecessary. There is no evidence which demonstrates that there are problems with the current system.

‘This announcement will only serve further to devastate teacher morale and endanger future recruitment to the profession and the retention of existing teachers.’
