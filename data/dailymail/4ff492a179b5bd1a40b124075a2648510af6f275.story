Revolutionary: The soft robotic exoskeleton suit being developed at Harvard University's Wyss Institute for the U.S. Department of Defense

A robotic exoskeleton that is so light and comfortable it can be slipped on like a pair of trousers is being developed by Harvard scientists for a U.S. Defence Department.

The contraption, called the exosuit and comprising of a harness with tubing that wraps around the wearer’s legs, helps people lift heavier loads than they are naturally capable of.

Experts hope to eventually merge the prototype exosuit with real clothing so it will become a second skin and benefit athletes, soldiers and those who cannot walk because of muscle injuries.

‘You can imagine something like a 
spider web that's integrated into tightly fitting pants,’ Conor Walsh, a
 robotics researcher at Harvard University's Wyss Institute and leader 
of the team that designed and built the exosuit, told NBC News.

The suit is not the first robotic exoskeleton to have been trialled, although it is probably the most comfortable.

Hard
 metal and plastic outfits like those are already beginning to give 
paralysed people the ability to free themselves of wheelchairs but they 
are heavy, cumbersome units of machinery.

The
 exosuit is more of an enhancer than an assistant. It is much lighter 
than the hard prosthetic exoskeletons, weighing just 7.5 kilograms (not 
including the air supply that drives the artificial ‘muscles’).

Also, the suit relies on the existing
 movement of the legs as a person walks - its talent is adding extra 
power or force at the just right moment.

The suit's performance was tested by five healthy males after they trained to use it for about three days. 

Walsh
 said that the suit is confusing to react to at first, but once a person
 adjusts  to the extra 'body part', they feel the the subtle benefits.

Early stages: Experts hope to one day eventually merge the prototype exosuit with real clothing so it will become a second skin and benefit athletes, soldiers and those who cannot walk because of muscle injuries

The suit is
 significantly lighter than other man-made exoskeletons as it does not 
contain a rigid structure and composed primarily of specially designed 
fabrics.

The exosuit is more of an enhancer than an 
assistant, helping a person pick up heavier loads than they might 
naturally be able to. It is hoped the protoype will be developed into a 
suit that can help athletes and soldiers

He said: 'When you wear it, you feel like you're getting a bit of a boost. After you stop wearing it, you notice that you don't have that extra assist any more.’

Though applications and large-scale manufacture are years away, Walsh says the suit will see development in three main areas.

In the military, it is hoped it will 
help soldiers walk farther and carry heavier loads. For athletes it 
could form the basis for performance enhancing prostheses.

Experts say the exosuit would need to be 
custom-fit to a person's frame and gait much liked a  bicycle must have 
its handlebars adjusted to the user

And in rehabilitation medicine it could be a breakthrough treatment for people who can no longer walk because their muscles are damaged.

The suit would need to be custom-fit 
to a person's frame and gait, but that's a one-time thing, Walsh says, 
'If you buy a bicycle you have to adjust the handlebars and then it's 
set.'

After that, he explained, 'Every time they want to wear it, they [can] pull it on like a piece of clothing.'
