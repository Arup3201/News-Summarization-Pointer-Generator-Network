Mario Gotze has lifted the lid behind his photo with Lionel Messi after the World Cup final.

Gotze uploaded an Instagram picture with the 27-year-old superstar following Germany's 1-0 summer showpiece win against Argentina.

Gotze scored the only goal of the game in extra-time to give his country their fourth World Cup win at the expense of Messi and his international team-mates at Brazil's iconic Maracana stadium.

Accompanied with the caption 'Genius @leomessi', the picture shows the 22-year-old with his man-of-the match medal around his neck next to a pensive-looking Messi.

The timing of the photo may be in question following the emotional state of the two players at the time, but Gotze insists it was all in good spirits.

In a television interview with German show Audi Star Talk, the Bayern Munich midfielder was asked whether or not it was Messi who asked to have his photo taken with the World Champion but reveals it was the other way around.

'If I am honest, I was in a conference room and I had won the medal for man-of-the-match,' Gotze said.

'I saw him from behind and went running after him to get a picture, so it was actually the other way around.

'I think everyone who plays football know what it's like to miss a goal or lose a game, you can't always win.

'That's why you know how to go about with someone in that situation.

'The best thing to do is leave him alone because I don't think you can ever find the right words, there isn't really much you can say.'
