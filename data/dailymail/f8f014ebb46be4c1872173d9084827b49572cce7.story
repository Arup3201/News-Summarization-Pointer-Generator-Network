Former Newcastle team-mates Jonas Gutierrez and Steve Harper have teamed up to raise money for a men's cancer charity.

Harper, who now plays at Hull City, joined forces with former Newcastle Falcons and Scotland player Richard Metcalfe, as well as businessman Paul Varley to create an underwear company Oddballs.

Ten per cent of the money from all sales of the products will go to testicular cancer charities.

The charity tweeted to say they were extremely grateful for the donation an honoured to meet the duo

Gutierrez missed 17 months of football in total after getting, and beating, the disease twice.

And the 31-year-old Argentine, who made his return to competitive football against Manchester United last week, was present as a cheque for £2,500 was donated to the charity Ballboys.

The charity then tweeted: 'Just received a very generous donation from @myoddballs & met  @egalgojonas @steveharper37 #honoured'.

Gutierrez stunned many when he made his return to competitive action recently, but now the former Mallorca midfielder is hopeful of securing a new contract.

‘I am living day by day,’ he said. ‘All I can do is work hard in training and work as hard as I can. I’m going to fight for my place — I always try to do that.

‘I’m recovering, I’m healthy and I’m feeling strong — now I have to wait for my opportunity and fight for that.

‘I have three months to do my best and we’ll see what happens. This is football, you are going to get opportunities so you have to be ready for that.’
