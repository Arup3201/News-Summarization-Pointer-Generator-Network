A blind, housebound pensioner was left without a vital telephone connection since Christmas Eve after BT bosses decided her case 'was not a priority', it was revealed today.

Thelma Hingston, 89, lives alone in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, and is reliant on her phone to speak to family, friends and neighbours who help her.

But she has been left feeling isolated and 'extremely upset' after her phone line suddenly went down on Christmas Eve.

Despite numerous emails to BT Openreach by her family pleading for an engineer to fix the problem her case was dismissed as not coming under 'the priority care team'.

Cut off: Thelma Hingston, 89, lives alone in Tenbury Wells, Worcestershire, and is reliant on her phone to speak to family, friends and neighbours who help her

As a result, her phone line remains dead.

Son Colin Hingston, 64, said his family's Christmas and New Year was ruined because they were so worried something would happen to his mum and they wouldn't find out until it was too late.

Mr Hingston said: 'She is panicking, it is just stress on top of everything else. She just keeps thinking, what happens if I fall? If she has a fall at 5pm I wouldn't know until 9am the next day.

'We try to visit her twice a day and neighbours pop in occasionally, but she relies on her phone to communicate with people. It is quite frightening, it is not a nice feeling to think you are totally isolated.

'The worst possible case scenario is she has one of her falls and we get there the following morning and she is dead. That is the worst case scenario, and how would BT feel then?'

Mrs Hingston, a widow who is unsteady on her feet and can only walk with the aid of a stick, has no mobile phone coverage where she lives and is totally reliant on her land line to communicate.

She has lost her sight over the past year which has left her too scared to leave the house alone, and has a panic alarm fitted at her home in case she falls.

BT Openreach said it is trying to repair Mrs Hingston's phone line as quickly as possible

Mr Hingston, who runs a liqueur 
company called Tipsy Fruit Gins, lives nine miles away from his mother 
and tries to pop in to see her twice a day to check she is OK.

But
 he is terrified that she will take a nasty tumble when no one is with 
her and there will be no way for her to call anyone for help.

He
 said: 'She has gone blind in the past year. She is out in the middle of
 the countryside and she can't go for a walk on her own because she is 
too frightened.

'She is a little unsteady on her feet and her balance is going because of her lack of sight.'

Mrs
 Hingston phone line is run through the Post Office and went dead on 
Christmas Eve. But her family did not manage to get through to the firm 
until December 27 because it was closed on bank holidays.

When Mr Hingston finally managed to speak to someone he was told to contact BT Openreach which runs the physical phone lines.

But despite being told Mrs Hingston was frail, blind and effectively housebound, they deemed she was not a priority case.

Mr
 Hingston said: 'Someone at BT Openreach decided that she wasn't in a 
serious enough situation to go to the Priority Care Team, which is 
absolutely ridiculous.

'It 
is absolutely outrageous. I've been trying not to get too angry about 
it, but it's absolutely appalling. It is heartless. It is ridiculous, 
they are letting down a vulnerable pensioner. They are just not caring.

'BT Openreach are totally uncontactable - they are a world to their own. I just feel angry.'

After firing off a string of emails to their customer care department, Mr Hingston was eventually put through to someone on December 30 who said they wouldn't be able to look at the problem for another two days.

And he was sent an email by Matthew King, a senior manager at BT, apologising for the problems his mother was experiencing, but saying he was unable to help because it related to another department.

Mr Hingston said: 'It is just a case of passing the buck. If a department in my business told a customer â€˜It's not my department, I can't help' I would be bust in a year.

'It has really blighted our family's Christmas and New Year. I have spending all my time on the internet trying to contact someone all Christmas, but to no avail. We have all been really worried.

'I have a brother living in America and he's been frantic because he hasn't been able to get through to our mum. And my mother has been really upset. It is outrageous.'

An Openreach spokesman said: 'Openreach is trying to repair Mrs Hingston's phone line as quickly as possible, having been alerted to the problem by Mrs Hingston's phone supplier on December 27.

'An engineer has already been dispatched and discovered a faulty overhead cable. In order to replace the cable we need to block the road and arrange for temporary traffic lights.

'This requires permission from the local council which we are trying to arrange as a matter of urgency.'
