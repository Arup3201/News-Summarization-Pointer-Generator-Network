Marvin Schwabe will have aspirations to replace Manuel Neuer as Germany's first choice goalkeeper in the future but it seems like he is already starting to mimic the Bayern Munich star.

Germany Under-20 shot stopper pulled off a skill that  Neuer has pulled off on more than one occasion by dribbling past a Polish striker during a recent international match.

The Hoffenheim goalkeeper embarrassed his opponent by putting the ball through his legs before passing it on to a Germany team-mate.

Schwabe, who was a youth wrestling champion before concentrating on his football career, is yet to start a competitive match for the Bundesliga outfit this season, as he remains behind Oliver Baumann in the Hoffenheim pecking order.

Neuer's latest marauding run saw him act as a 'sweeper keeper' by picking up possession on the edge of the penalty area before dribbling past his defensive team-mates.
