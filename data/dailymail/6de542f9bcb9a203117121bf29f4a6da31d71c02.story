Get a whiff of this: a French research, art and design centre have created a gizmo, similar to a mobile phone, that enables the user to send up to 320 different smells to other devices of its kind.

La Laborotoire's cylindrical oPhone, invented by David Edwards and Harvard students Rachel Field and Amy Yin in the Paris laboratories, uses a tiny chip, the oChip, to produce scent signals using olfactive information, which are then sent out and received by connecting an app - OTracks - to Bluetooth.

And Edwards says the chips will soon be able to send thousands of different smells.

The team have been prototyping the oPhone for one year, and recently unveiled the latest version at the Wired UK conference, as reported in Wired.

The product will be out later this year and will come with two oPhones, to enable people to smell more than one smell at the same time.

It is ultimately aimed at creating mulch-sensory media experiences. According to Wired, Edwards is working with Paris Vapors to use the product in books, movies and television shows.

The oPhone product will be sold in pairs to enable users to experience multiple smells simultaneously

Would you send nice smells.... or would you send unpleasant ones?
