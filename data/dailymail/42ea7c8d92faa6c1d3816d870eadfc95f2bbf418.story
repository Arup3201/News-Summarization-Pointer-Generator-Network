Former Rangers skipper Barry Ferguson believes the Ibrox support will put their differences with the club's board to one side for a day as they pay tribute to Fernando Ricksen.

A host of retired Gers favourites will turn out for a charity game on Sunday in honour of the Dutchman, who is battling Motor Neurone Disease.

But so far only half the available tickets for the Ibrox match have been sold.

The Light Blues faithful have been engaged in a long-running dispute with the ruling regime at the club and attendances at Ibrox have sunk to record low levels. 

However, Ferguson believes all that will be forgotten about come Sunday as he predicted a sell-out crowd.

The 36-year-old - who won five Scottish titles over two spells with the Glasgow giants - said: 'I'm looking forward to the match. It's for a great cause. I'm really looking forward to meeting a lot of the lads I played with.

'Everything that has happened to Fernando just makes you appreciate life a lot more.

'It's a difficult time but I'm just doing a small part by showing up to pay my respects. You just need to see the turnout from former players who are coming to support him.

'I just hope the crowd is a big one. I've heard it's at 23,000 or 24,000 and I just hope it's a full house for the guy because he was a tremendous servant for the club. He captained it to trophies, so I hope there's a good turnout for him.

'I have no doubt the fans will forget about the off-field stuff and their issues with the way the club is being run. It's Fernando's day. Let's not forget that.

'He's going through a hard time. I'm sure the fans will realise (the profits) are going to Fernando, his kid, Motor Neurone Disease and various other charities. I'm more than sure there will be a great turnout for him.'

Barry Ferguson has called on Rangers to show up in numbers to support Ricksen 

Gennaro Gattuso is among a host of former Rangers players who have agreed to take part in friendly

Among the big names who will be pulling on a blue jersey once more are Michael Mols, Jorg Albertz, Ronald de Boer, Gennaro Gattuso and Marco Negri - who has become the latest former Ibrox player to sign up to fan-ownership group Rangers First.

It will allow the club's faithful to put their current difficulties to one side and remember the days when it was silverware and not boardroom battles that dominated their thoughts.

But Ferguson admits watching former team-mate Ricksen struggle with his debilitating - and ultimately fatal - illness will leave Sunday's occasion tinged with sadness.

'Fernando is some character,' he said. 'Everything I know about him, you couldn't repeat it outside of closed doors.

Ally McCoist will be barred from making an appearance at the friendly match, according to reports

'He's faced this with a lot of bravery and I take my hat off to him. He was like that as a player - a tough cookie. He's handling it really well.

'Even today when I met him he is still bright and he is excited about the game.

'But it's hard when you see a guy of his age going through what he is. He's only a year older than myself. You need to enjoy life.'

Reports this week have suggested axed boss Ally McCoist will be barred for making an appearance alongside the other former players under the terms of his garden leave.

But Ferguson hit back: 'If Ally wants to come and support Fernando I don't see why he shouldn't be allowed to.

'It's a great cause. Fernando has a terrible illness and if someone wants to come and show their support for Fernando, I don't see why it should be a problem.'

Meanwhile, the Rangers Supporters Trust has announced it has now passed the one-million share threshold after buying up another chunk of shares in the club.
