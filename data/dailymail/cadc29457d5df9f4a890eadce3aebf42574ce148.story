It's a sticky issue that has plagued scientists – and breakfast tables – for decades.

But now researchers claim to have found the definitive answer as to why a piece of toast always seems to fall buttered side down.

Apparently, it’s all to do with the height of the table. They claim that after it topples off the edge, the toast only has time to perform a half-somersault before it lands.

As the side which has been buttered is naturally facing upwards, that’s the side which ends up on the floor.

To confirm the theory, food expert Professor Chris Smith and his team dropped 100 slices of toast from a table at Manchester MET University. The table was two and a half feet high.

In 81 per cent of cases, the buttered side made contact with the floor. The research was commissioned to mark the DVD release of the latest series of The Big Bang Theory, a US comedy about a group of socially awkward physicists.

‘The question of whether the toast does indeed always land buttered side down is exactly the kind of quandary that would keep the characters in Big Bang Theory awake at night,’ said Professor Smith.

‘Our research shows that Sod’s Law really does exist when it comes to dropped toast.

‘The upshot is that if you want to ensure your toast lands butter side up then you should invest in a higher table approximately 8ft high that allows the toast to rotate a full 360 degrees. Failing that – try not to drop the toast.’

While the crucial element is the height of the table, which affects the time the toast takes to fall, the physics of the slice of toast itself also have an effect.

The air pockets in a slice of bread create drag as it falls.

But buttering one side of the bread changes that surface, altering the level of drag and changing the way it rotates as it falls.

The phenomenon has baffled scientists and the public alike for almost 180 years.

It was discussed as long ago as 1835, in the New York Monthly Magazine.

Of course, the problem only occurs if you can spread the butter in the first place.

A recent survey of 3,000 people found their biggest breakfast bugbear was ruining a slice of toast by trying to spread butter that was too cold.

But designers came up with a solution – a heated knife to warm the butter, which baker Warburtons hopes to produce.
