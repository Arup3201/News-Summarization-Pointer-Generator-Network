It is a move that is sure to leave Superman fans divided - and would make his former beau Lois Lane green with envy.

Superman and Wonder Woman, romantically linked in the past, have finally hooked up to become the world's most powerful superhero couple.

The romance follows the relaunching of several much-loved superhero characters by DC Comics last year.

The story behind some much-loved characters were altered as part of the move, with Superman's relationship with former lover Lois Lane erased.

Superman and Wonder Woman will finally pair up following a 'significant event' in the new comic Justice League #12, according to the Guardian.

The link up will make sense to many fans, as the pair are in a line of work that requires them to hide their powers from mere mortals, while they both sometimes work very anti-social hours.

The front cover of Justice League features the two superheroes kissing in a passionate embrace.

Other changes introduced for Superman by DC Comics include the death of his adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent and the end of him wearing his distinctive red pants outside his blue suit.

The next Superman film, Man of Steel, is due for release next year, with British actor Henry Cavill playing the superhero in the title role.

Russell Crowe will play Superman's father, Jor-El, with Amy Adams as Lois Lane.

There are rumours Wonder Woman, famously played by Lynda Carter in the 1970s TV series, will also be made into a film.
