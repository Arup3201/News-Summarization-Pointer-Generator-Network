How can it be that in 2014, fully 18 years into the professional game, England are going to play a three-match Test series in New Zealand and are being prevented from picking their strongest team for the vital first Test?   Those missing players represent the biggest cock-up since the 'Tour from Hell' in 1998! 

I inherited a crazy itinerary that year when, in very quick succession, an under-strength squad had to play Australia, New Zealand A, New Zealand Academy, the first All Blacks Test, New Zealand Maori in midweek, the second Test and then take a 16-hour flight to play South Africa in Cape Town.

Absolutely insane. That itinerary was put together by somebody who didn't put the England team first. Stuart Lancaster (England's current coach) is having to leap through logistical hoops when this battle should have been fought - and won - a long time ago. Do not think for one minute this is just one of those things and won't happen again. The Premiership has started to flex its muscles, as we have seen in the recent European Cup negotiations. 

England should always comes first if you want to win a World Cup.

The visit by England will be a massive 
financial driver for the NZRFU and you would think the RFU might have 
negotiated much harder on England's behalf. The All Blacks never come 
cheaply when they visit these shores and accept only the itinerary that 
suits them. And I don't blame them.

Was enough
 effort really made to get New Zealand to put the Test schedule back by a
 week, which would have helped immensely? Were the England players 
consulted at all? How much was Lancaster consulted? 

If I was a first-choice player such as Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Luther
 Burrell, Owen  Farrell and Billy Vunipola - who will all miss out 
because of the Premiership final - I would be livid at even being put in
 this position. 

You dedicate large chunks of your career to win selection. You overcome
 injuries to fight for  the jersey, earning the right  to play against 
New Zealand  at Eden Park. Then, suddenly, your place is handed on a 
plate to somebody else. 

Controversy: England's last two visits to New Zealand have been ruined by off-field incidents

This tour is starting on the back foot and it 
will be great credit to Lancaster, his coaches, and especially the 
players, if they come back with more positives than negatives from the 
hardest school in world rugby.

Make no mistake, though, this tour is 
ideal for England as they prepare for RWC 2015; they need to find out 
where they are as a team and make some informed judgments on their 
players.

Ideally, I would like to have seen an extra couple of fixtures, 
certainly another midweek game against the Maori, to get a large squad 
operating as one but it's still an exciting itinerary.

It is also massively important off the field because England's last two
 visits to New Zealand have been ruined by off-field incidents.

End-of-season tours of New Zealand are just plain difficult but England
 must flip the psychology around. English rugby is in a good place, with
 a strong group of players on an upward curve and an excellent coaching 
team improving with every game.  

Challenge: Tour has started on the back foot for England coach Stuart Lancaster

England can
 still put out a very competitive side next Saturday against a New 
Zealand team that will be short on preparation. England should all be 
highly motivated and, for many, it will still be the most important game
 of their careers so far.

Lancaster 
must challenge those selected to produce the performance of their 
careers and come away with a win. England aren't meant to win in New 
Zealand. It doesn't happen very often, nobody will be expecting it. But 
it could happen.

The All Blacks will be strong favourites but there is an opportunity to
 build a classic backs-to-the-wall mentality in Auckland ahead of the 
first Test. If England win it will automatically make them favourites 
for the World Cup - and that is what they should be aspiring to be.

Recall: Fly-half Danny Cipriani last played for England in 2008

If England do win, it gets very interesting psychologically. Only 'special' teams beat the All Blacks in New Zealand so  Lancaster would then have to decide whether to parachute in those five or six first-choice players  who were unavailable. 

Do you stick with the team that won or introduce players  champing at the bit to get their shirts back? That would be a great dilemma to face.

I believe that could be the case but touring New Zealand is the hardest assignment bar none. To win, you need everyone's noses pointing in the same direction and the Premiership and the RFU have let down this group of players.
