Alex Tillinghast is clearly not a man to waste his time with the simple shots when on the basketball court - it's spectacular or nothing.

The first-year student at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa won himself a truck after making a miraculous half-way line shot on the buzzer during a half-time challenge at a College Basketball match.

The odds were stacked against Tillinghast when he was picked out the crowd at Drake's Bulldog Madness event on Tuesday night.

Drake University first year student Alex Tillinghast won himself a truck by completing a basketball challenge 

The student sank a miraculous shot from half-court with just one second left on the clock to win the prize

Tillinghast was mobbed by Drake players and fans after achieving the incredible feat

He had to score with a lay-up, a free throw, a three-pointer and then the half-court shot - all within 30 seconds - to win the Ford F-150 worth £32,000.

And it's fair to say things didn't start too brilliantly for the mop-haired, cargo pant-wearing fresher as he missed the lay-up shot, the easiest of the lot, not once but twice.

He finally did it and then nailed the free throw on the first attempt, giving himself plenty of time to sink the three-pointer.

Just as well because Tillinghast, clearly not a baller, needed quite a few goes to make the shot count.

Things had not started too well for the student, who needed three attempts to make a simple lay-up shot

The third part of the challenge was to score with a three-pointer and Tillinghast needed quite a few goes

Everyone wanted to join Tillinghast in his celebrations after completing the challenge 

Then, against all the odds with just five seconds remaining, he somehow summoned all the good fortune in the world to score from half-way with a once-in-a-lifetime shot, sparking delirious scenes as the Drake team and fans ran over to mob him.

As Tillinghast proves, it's sometimes better to have Lady Luck on your side than actually be good at something.
