Louis van Gaal is known as a man who does things his own way.  When it comes to formations, he is certainly bucking the trend and reaped the benefits in his first game in charge at Manchester United when a new-look side in a 3-4-3 formation demolished LA Galaxy.

Very few people have managed to use the system successfully in England. So, what does the change mean for the United squad? Who fits in? Who doesn't? Sportsmail takes a look...

It looks like Juan Mata will finally get to return to the central role in behind the forwards where he plays his best football.

There he won Chelsea's player of the year two seasons running before Jose Mourinho and David Moyes decided to predominantly stick him on the wing.

In those first two seasons in England playing in the centre he scored or set up a goal every other game and created almost three goal-scoring chances per match.

When Mourinho forced him out wide at the start of the last campaign he failed to score and provided just two assists.

The three forwards in Van Gaal's system are more centrally focused, with the impetus on the wing-backs to fly up the flanks when they are in attack, leaving Mata to concentrate on what matters.

That system, with the wing-backs providing a lot of the attacking width, will allow Wayne Rooney to concentrate on his lethal finishing inside and around the box.

Rooney loves to drop deep but if Van Gaal can convincing him to leave that to others, his goal return could soar.

It would seem Danny Welbeck will be hard-pressed to get in the side when Robin van Persie returns from his holiday and he will also be competing against Javier Hernandez. A poacher like the Mexican could also flourish in a system designed around getting the ball into the box from all angles.

Ashely Young may have come from the bench to score twice against LA Galaxy but surely his days are numbered.

He is an out-and-out winger but possesses none of the defensive skills required to play directly on the flanks for Van Gaal. Similarly Nani and Wilfried Zaha could also struggle.

They could all be an option for the attacking three up top, but would find it difficult to compete there.

Where Adnan Januzaj fits in is also a conundrum. The 19-year-old was a revelation last season, but there is no obvious place for him either.

One thing is for certain, world record full-back Luke Shaw will thrive. At Southampton he often played more as a left winger than a left-back and will have no problem with the physical demands of tearing up and down that flank all match.

He has both the fitness levels and ability on the ball to form part of a lethal attack when they have the ball and drop back into a formidable defence when they don't.

That role, on the opposite side, suits Antonio Valencia too, who possesses enough muscle and skill to handle himself defensively.

Ander Herrera was awarded man of the match after pulling the strings in central midfield against LA Galaxy. The new £29million man dominated the centre of the pitch, showing off his array of passing.

Van Gaal needs central midfielders who can control the tempo and tie together the rest of the side with a high level of passing ability.

Michael Carrick, when he returns from the ankle injury that has ruled him out for 10 weeks, will also fit perfectly into that mould.

Darren Fletcher, who was afforded the full 90 minutes on Wednesday night, and Tom Cleverley, although not popular among many fans, have a similarly suitable skill set.

Van Gaal instructed Manchester United to sell Marouane Fellaini while he was still in charge of Holland during the World Cup – and there does not appear to be a place for him in the side.

The Belgian is not strong enough in attack to warrant a place in the front three nor adept enough in the middle to command a place there.

He can float between the two, but in Van Gaal's system it is one or the other. Both Anderson and Shinji Kagawa also look like they do not fit in anywhere and will be concerned for their futures.

Hair we go: Marouane Fellaini is not on Manchester United's tour and is set to leave Old Trafford this summer 

At the moment, following the departures of Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic and Van Gaal utilising three at the back, Chris Smalling, Phil Jones and Jonny Evans are virtually certain to start.

That is surely an area Van Gaal has identified as one that needs reinforcing, but as it stands there is no serious competition for places.

Case for the defence: Phil Jones is virtually certain to start in the Van Gaal era
