A couple found dead holding hands in a burnt-out car killed themselves when the a care home that they owned was facing closure, an inquest heard yesterday.

Isabel Ibanez-Mahiques and Jaswant Singh Beeharry were discovered dead in their BMW in a field in Cambridgeshire in June last year.

A day earlier, they had been due to announce to staff at the Maria-Helena home in Spalding, Lincolnshire that it was being shut down. Instead, they were found dead in an isolated sugar beet field.

Suicide: Jaswant Singh Beharry and Isabel Ibanez-Mahiques killed themselves in June last year

The inquest in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire heard that the couple, who also owned a home near King's Lynn in Norfolk, had run into trouble when inspectors delivered a critical report on their business.

Mr Beeharry, 48, and Ms Ibanez-Mahiques, 53, had struggled to attract residents to their homes, but there were still 35 people living at Marina-Helena at the time of their death.

The week before they committed suicide, the pair told the council they would have to shut down their business.

'They were devastated about the business,' said care home manager Lisa Farr, who worked for the couple for 12 years.

'I first noticed a change in Mr Beeharry earlier on in the year, identifying those problems as depression.

'He told me as I drove him to the car home the day before he was found that he was due a breakdown.'

In a statement Glen Garrod, Lincolnshire's assistant director for adult social care, said: 'Safeguarding concerns had been put in place in November 2011.

'The council also expressed concerns about medicine management in September 2011. In October there was a suspension order put in place.

'In February 2012 this was lifted but the couple continued to struggle to make payments.

Business: They also ran Terrington Lodge, a care home near King's Lynn in Norfolk

'Mr Beeharry sent two letters, one on June 1 and one on June 6. He stated they were struggling financially due to lower occupancy rates.

'He expressed concerns about the lack of referrals to the care home and expressed concerns about late payments from residents widening the deficit.'

The couple were found dead on June 9, 2012. The Maria-Helena home closed down a month later.

Cambridgeshire Coroner William Morris said he was satisfied that the pair, who lived in Wisbech, took their own lives, and recorded a verdict of suicide.
