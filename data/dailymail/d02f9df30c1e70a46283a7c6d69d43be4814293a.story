The daughter of Tory MP Nadine Dorries has  a relationship with Conservative MP and son of a multi-millionaire Chris Kelly, it has been revealed.

Student Philippa Dorries, who already has a lucrative part-time job as her mother's House of Commons office manager, has been seeing Mr Kelly, 34, for 'several months', as revealed by Richard Kay.

The 27-year-old law student's new partner is the handsome Conservative MP for Dudley South, while his father owns lorry firm Keltruck, the largest independent Scania dealership in the world.

Blonde Philippa also received £40,000 a year while employed as Mrs Dorries' House of Commons office manager, a job the Tory MP says she has had for four years.

Mr Kelly, meanwhile, also tops up his £65,000-a-year MP's salary by earning up to £4,000 a month working for his father's company.

Last year, he earned more than £25,000 with Keltruck for just 16 hours a month. This may have helped him acquire a £30,000 BMW coupe, complete with personalised number plate, which is the envy of the Commons' car park.

The pair are said to have been dating for several months and have been seen together at social events in Mr Kelly's constituency.

Philippa is studying her final law exams at BPP college in London.

Last year anti-Euro MP Mr Kelly was reportedly reduced to tears after being caught in the crossfire between his millionaire father, also called Chris, and a furious David Cameron over a vote to stop Brussels gaining more power over Britain.

Mr Kelly  was among several anti-EU Tories subjected to a four-letter onslaught by Mr Cameron as he battled to curb revolt over Europe’s ability to meddle with Parliamentary sovereignty.

After it emerged that she employed her own daughter, Mrs Dorries denied any wrongdoing.

She said her daughter has worked for her for four years as an office manager, and that for the past two years, while she studied, Philippa had her pay reduced to reflect the hours when she attends lectures.

The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority has been informed, says Nadine.
