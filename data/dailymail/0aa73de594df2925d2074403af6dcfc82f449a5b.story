A Florida mental health counselor has been arrested for allegedly murdering her lesbian lover's two-year-old daughter after the girl's mother, also a mental health counselor, broke up with her.Â 

Kymberley Lucas, 40, also tried to kill Jacquelyn Jamason's 10-year-old son - and possibly herself, police said.

Officers were called to Lucas' Jupiter, Florida, home Monday for a reported drowning. There, they found Elliana Lucas-Jamason, 2, dead.
