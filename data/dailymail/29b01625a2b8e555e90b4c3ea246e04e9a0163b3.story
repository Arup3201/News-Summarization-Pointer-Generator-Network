From Helena Christensen to Luisiana Lopilato, Britain's favourite bust-boosting bra brand has had a stellar succession of leading ladies in its campaigns over the years.

Starting with Lisa Snowdon in 1999, Ultimo has also worked with Penny Lancaster, Rachel Stewart, Peaches Geldof and Scary Spice, Mel B.

And to celebrate the brand's 14th birthday, we have brought together all of Ultimo's leading ladies.

'I am so thrilled to be celebrating the brand’s 14th birthday. Ultimo has grown from a single, small idea into a heritage UK lingerie brand,' said founder Michelle Mone, 41, herself no stranger to appearing in front of the camera in her underwear.

'I’m so proud of my team and excited about the year ahead, which is going to be enormous for Ultimo.'

The lingerie label, which launched in 1999, is famous for its cleavage-boosting designs and was one of the first to use celebrities rather than models in its campaigns.

Its first bra contained silicone gel and promised a boost without resorting to surgery. The enhancing lingerie proved a huge hit and a mega-brand was born.

'Ultimo launched with one bra concept and we have since had huge successes with other creations, including Ultimo Promise and the Backless Body,' added Mone.

'For me, our success is all down to the fact that we’re constantly striving to create that next incredible invention – paired with unrivalled fit and design.'

The last year has been a difficult one for Mone, thanks to her split from husband Michael, who co-founded the label, and news that her former flame is to launch a rival lingerie firm.

Matters were made worse by allegations of an affair with former Ultimo head designer, Samantha Bunn, who has now joined Michael at Pendulum Apparel.

'The past 12 months have been pretty 
tough to say the least, due to my separation,' admitted Mone.

But according to the lingerie supremo, prospects are looking decidedly perky as the dust settles in the wake of the split.

'I’m delighted to say 
that business is back on track and growing steadily,' she added. 'Our partnership 
with MAS Holdings means the sky is the limit and I’m very excited about 
Ultimo’s future.

'Here’s to another 14 years.'
