Miracle: This three-pound baby boy was born three months premature but miraculously alive after his mother was hit by a stray car tyre putting her in a coma

Family members said the newborn is able to breathe on his own and have called him a miracle baby.

Lesley,19, suffered brain trauma after being struck on the head and sent crashing to the sidewalk by the runaway tyre.

The eight-months pregnant teen had been walking along a busy street in Naples, Florida, when a tyre came off a passing car.

Eye witnesses said the tyre bounced over a median and knocked Leslie to the ground face first.

Horror: Witness to the scene, Christine Lester said what she saw still gives her goosebumps as she remembers Ms Coley laying face-down on the ground

Hope: Ms Coley's sister, Cecilia, said they are holding out hope for the mother's recovery and are refraining from naming the little boy until she wakes up

She had attempted to evade the tyre, but was struck on the back of the head sending her crashing to the ground.

The driver of the car stopped to offer assistance.

Leslie was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers where she underwent an emergency C-section as doctors battled to save the life of her unborn child.

Fall: Ms Coley, pictured, is said to have been struck in the back of the head before falling forward, landing on the concrete and directly on her pregnant belly

Recovery: Ms Coley was airlifted to Lee Memorial Hospital in Fort Myers where she is listed in critical condition

Eyewitness Christine Lester said: 'This 
woman was laying on the ground gasping for breath at eight months 
pregnant. I haven't stopped thinking about it since it happened. I have 
goose bumps. I hope that she's OK. I hope that her child is OK'.

Lesley's sister said her nephew will not be named until her sister is out of the intensive care unit.

Doctors have placed her in a medical induced coma but said she is in a critical condition.

Describing the accident, Lesley's sister Cecila said: 'She got struck in the back of the head, fell forward, landed on the concrete and she landed on her belly - on the baby.'

Cecilia said the newborn boy was holding his own in the premature baby unit.

'He is so gorgeous and I think he is 
truly a blessing and for him to survive. And right now, he's breathing, 
he's strong. I think that's just incredible and I think he's a miracle 
baby,â€™ she told WBBH.

She said she hopes her sister will make a speedy recovery and will be able to hold her son.

'They both are troopers and I know 
they're going to make it, so I'm praying to God that this is OK. I can't
keep guessing - they will make it, they will make it, they're going to 
make it,' she said.
