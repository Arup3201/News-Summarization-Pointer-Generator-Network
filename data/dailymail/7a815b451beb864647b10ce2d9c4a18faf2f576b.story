Professor Mary Beard was sent a bomb threat on social networking site Twitter. It is the latest in a series of threats and vulgar insults she has been subjected to

Television historian Mary Beard has revealed she was sent a bomb threat on Twitter, hours after the social networking site’s UK boss personally apologised to women who have been attacked by 'trolls'.

Ms Beard, a professor of classics at University of Cambridge, said she had contacted police after receiving a message last night claiming a bomb had been left outside her home.

She wrote on her Twitter page: 'Just got 1 of these messages. A bomb has been placed outside your home. It will go off at exactly 10.47pm and destroy everything. Told police.'

She later wrote: 'OK all, it’s 11.00pm and we are still here. So unless the trolling bombers timekeeping is rotten.... all is well. But how stupidly nasty.'

The writer is among a number of prominent women who have been subjected to a stream of vile abuse and threats on Twitter.

Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer, as well as a number of other women, have previously said they had been the subject of bomb threats on the site, while two received threats of rape.

In separate incidents, Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully fought for a woman’s face to appear on £10 banknotes, were also threatened on Twitter with rape. Two arrests have already been made in relation to those threats.

Professor Beard, 58, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'There’s something very strangely and awkwardly insidious about it.

'It is is scary and it has got to stop. I didn’t actually intellectually feel that I was in danger but I thought I was being harassed, and and I thought I was being harassed in a particularly unpleasant way.'

Tony Wang, Twitter UK general manager, posted a series of tweets yesterday saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable'.

The professor also tweeted about her struggle to report the threat to the website's administrators

His messages came after the website clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks.

Mr Wang wrote: 'I personally apologise to the women who have experienced abuse on Twitter and for what they have gone through.

'The abuse they’ve received is simply not acceptable. It’s not acceptable in the real world, and it’s not acceptable on Twitter.

'There is more we can and will be doing to protect our users against abuse. That is our commitment.'

The company has updated its rules to make it clear that abuse will not be tolerated and has put extra staff in place to handle reports of abuse, it said.

The move comes as Scotland Yard said its e-crime unit was investigating allegations by eight people of abuse on the microblogging site.

An online petition calling for Twitter to add a 'report abuse' button to tweets has already attracted more than 124,000 signatures.

An 'in-tweet' report button has been added so people can report abusive behaviour directly from a tweet, Twitter said.

The anonymous Twitter accounts from which the bomb threats originated were suspended, although screen grabs were widely circulated online.

Scotland Yard said an investigation into eight allegations had been launched.

The force said: 'Detectives from the Specialist Organised & Economic Crime Command have taken responsibility for the investigations into a number of allegations recently made to the MPS relating to allegations of malicious communication made on the social networking site Twitter.

'The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU), who hold the police national cyber crime remit, is now investigating allegations made by eight people that they have been subject to harassment, malicious communication or bomb threats.'

It said the decision was taken to centralise the individual investigations, including three from outside London.

Many are taking part in a one-day boycott of Twitter to put pressure on the site to take more effective to prevent online abuse and threats.

The hashtag #twittersilence has been trending all day and some of the celebrities supporting it are Thick Of It actor and comedian Chris Addison, magician Derren Brown, comedian Sarah Millican and TV presenter Kirstie Allsop.

Journalist and author Caitlin Moran promoted the boycott, saying: 'I’m pro the mooted 24-hour walk-out on 4th of August, because not only is it a symbolic act of solidarity – which are my favourite kinds of symbolic acts – but because it will also focus minds at Twitter to come up with their own solution to the abuses of their private company.'

However, some have called the boycott 'pointless'. Others said the best way to prevent online abuse is to name and shame offenders.

Twitter user Caileigh Scott said: 'Silence is what oppressors and abusers want from their victims.

'Make noise, not #twittersilence. Be heard.'
