Footage has emerged of the house of horrors where a Russian historian held birthday parties for 150 little girls he had dug up from their graves and mummified.

Anatoly Moskvin, 46, from the city of Nizhny Novgorod in central Russia, was arrested in 2011 after it emerged he had dug up corpses of girls aged between three and 12.

He then took the bodies home and turned them into a grisly collection of mummies, dressing the bodies and skeletons in stockings and dresses and even making one look like a teddy bear. 

A video made by Moskvin and found at his apartment by investigators showed a corridor cluttered with wedding dresses and bright, colourful clothes.
