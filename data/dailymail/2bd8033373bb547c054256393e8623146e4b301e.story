Keira Knightley may be six months pregnant but there will be no slackening in pace as she sashays up the red carpet at the Oscars tomorrow. Make-up can hide any exhaustion after all.

For the young British star, nominated as Best Actress for her role in The Imitation Game, the war-time movie about the Enigma codebreaker Alan Turing, it will be the last leg of a marathon of pre-award parties, post-award parties, talk show appearances and discussion events to promote the film.

It is a schedule that has prompted concern from a midwife and left her looking tired. Like countless other Oscars contenders, Knightley has learnt that there is no such thing as a night off when you are campaigning for a Harvey Weinstein film. Hollywood’s most famous and most influential producer was not nicknamed The Punisher for nothing.

Hungry for success: Harvey Weinstein with Keira Knightley, who has been nominated for an Oscar

If Knightley does win, his name is sure to spring quickly to her lips as she rolls out the thank-yous in her acceptance speech. This is the Hollywood power broker the stars offend at their peril.

Weinstein is a regular fixture on Oscars night, occasionally seen clutching a statuette or grinning magnanimously as a winner announces it could not have happened without him.

He has been thanked 24 times in Oscars speeches, more times than anyone, including God (Meryl Streep actually called him ‘God’ when she won a Golden Globe). Weinstein and his brother Bob have had more than 300 Oscar nominations for their films.

Weinstein is credited (particularly by himself) with spotting the movies that other studios would not touch – Shakespeare In Love, Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, The King’s Speech and The Artist – and making them into critically acclaimed box office hits. He has championed the film careers of Gwyneth Paltrow, Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Nicole Kidman and Keira Knightley, not to mention the violence-obsessed director Quentin Tarantino. Now he has his eyes on Cressida Bonas, Prince Harry’s ex who, he says, is a ‘fantastic’ actress (he produced her debut film Tulip Fever, released later this year).

In the flesh, of which there is a lot, the man known in Hollywood simply as ‘Harvey’ does not quite match the mannered period charm of his British films or the rarefied thespians he puts in them.

A bear of a man, he has a temper to match. Although friends insist he has calmed down with age and the humbling experience of seeing his career nosedive after an ignominious split from Disney empire a decade ago, Weinstein still clearly terrifies most people in his industry. He has been accused of trying to throttle one film executive and it is claimed he once put a reporter in a headlock.

This is not quite the behaviour one might expect of an honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire but the American was indeed awarded that honour for services to British film.

The 62-year-old son of a diamond cutter from suburban New York is admired, feared and loathed in equal measure in Hollywood but, as well as his reputation as the industry’s biggest bully, he is revered as a man with an unmatched skill in nurturing small independent films.

While the main studios rely on relentless comic book adventures and sequels and dull rom-coms, he is one of the few people who can raise money to make interesting movies.

During the current awards season, Weinstein has been in his element. Winning is worth more than just a gold statuette – The King’s Speech (with Colin Firth as George VI) was originally expected to earn about $15 million but made $400 million after its triumph at the Academy Awards in 2011.

What’s more, it seems that no Oscars campaign stunt is too cynical for Weinstein. This year, he was up to his old tricks, highlighting the The Imitation Game’s gay rights relevance; codebreaker Alan Turing (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) was imprisoned over his homosexuality.

The film had been lambasted by critics for being anti-gay in wrongly suggesting Turing became a traitor in order to keep his sexuality secret but in a bravura PR gesture, Weinstein offered to return his CBE if it could be given posthumously to Turing and then called on the Oscars Academy to support gay rights and vote for his film.

Weinstein has spent millions promoting movies in the weeks before the Oscars. In 1999, he was said to have spent more on pushing Shakespeare In Love than most studios spend actually making a movie. Such huge spending makes a mockery of the idea that films are judged on their merits.

Weinstein uses every trick to get attention: star-laden screenings, cold-calling the Academy’s 6,000-plus voters (a variety of professionals within the industry) and holding lavish parties, such as the one hosted by Mick Jagger and Jennifer Lopez after The King’s Speech was nominated.

Last year, Weinstein concentrated his efforts on his film Philomena (the story about a young Irish girl who became pregnant out of wedlock and was sent to a convent). One of Weinstein’s biggest coups was getting the Pope to agree to meet the woman who inspired the film, together with Steve Coogan, its co-writer and star.

Weinstein’s schemes can get him in trouble. When Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan was unexpectedly beaten for Best Film in 1999 by Weinstein’s Shakespeare In Love, a furious Spielberg said that Weinstein had planted press stories challenging the historical accuracy of Saving Private Ryan. 

In 2001, he was accused of starting a whispering campaign against another Oscars rival, A Beautiful Mind (the biopic about a maths genius called John Nash who won a Nobel prize for Economics).

Weinstein, it was widely claimed, spread a rumour that Nash was antisemitic. Weinstein is said to have been furious when his plotting was exposed and blamed a female studio executive, yelling: ‘You’re going to go down for this!’ Weinstein denies the claims.

Even after this embarrassment, however, he seems not to have reformed his ways. When the acclaimed director Julie Taymor made a film about the painter Frida Kahlo for Weinstein’s company, Miramax Pictures, Harvey was unimpressed. They watched it at a cinema test screening and he lost his temper with Taymor and some of her team.

Moving menacingly close to Taymor’s boyfriend, Elliot Goldenthal, Weinstein is said to have yelled at him: ‘Why don’t you defend her so I can beat the s**t out of you!’ Weinstein denied the threats, saying he was ‘rude and impolite’.

Weinstein says he gets upset only because he is so passionate about films. Brutality in the film industry simply means honesty, he claims.

Film executive Jonathan Taplin said Weinstein tried to strangle him in a restaurant after Taplin sold the film Shine, about the troubled pianist David Helfgott, to another studio.

‘He was totally out of control and had to be thrown out of the restaurant,’ said Taplin. ‘It was very unpleasant to have this guy strangle you in a restaurant but I give him credit for being passionate enough about Shine to hunt me down and confront me.’ Weinstein denies it.

It is also claimed that Weinstein dragged a newspaper reporter out of a party in a headlock boasting he was the ‘****ing sheriff’. Again, he disputes the story.

An unabashed Anglophile, Weinstein is married to Georgina Chapman, the British fashion designer and co-founder of the expensive label Marchesa. His friends include Paul McCartney and Bill Clinton while Jeffrey Epstein, the paedophile financier with links to Prince Andrew, is said to be an ‘acquaintance’.

Oscar-winning director James Ivory once described him as a victim of ‘arrested adolescence... a bully who feels that if he screams and yells and punishes you enough, he is going get his way’.

Weinstein’s brutal reputation became the talk of Hollywood in 2008 when he tried to speed up the release of his film, The Reader, in time for the awards season. It was claimed he had badgered one of the film’s producers, Sydney Pollack, on his deathbed, and hassled the widow of Anthony Minghella, the other producer, who had recently died. Weinstein insisted the story was untrue until an email emerged which proved it was.

Weinstein’s reputation as a savage slasher of films in the cutting room if he regards them as too long or too slow, has earned him the nickname Harvey Scissorhands. Hayao Miyazaki, the Oscar-winning Japanese cartoon director, was so incensed by Weinstein’s tinkering with one of his films that he sent him a samurai sword with the ominous message: ‘No Cuts!’.

To his stars, though, Weinstein is charming and avuncular. ‘He looks out for me,’ said Gwyneth Paltrow. When Jude Law’s wife went into labour during filming, Weinstein arranged for a plane to fly her back to Britain and paid the cast and crew for four days while they waited for Law to get back on set.

No wonder actors fall over themselves to praise Weinstein from the Oscars podium; it is better to be pampered by The Punisher than risk being on his wrong side.
