Madonna may have suffered a triumphant fall at last night's Brit Awards, but it was Jimmy Carr's jokes that really fell flat.

The 42-year-old comedian has come under fire for suggesting that Madonna was taking Hormone Replacement Therapy drugs.

Jimmy was invited to present British Video of the Year alongside the American model Karlie Kloss.

Jimmy Carr has been slammed on Twitter for suggesting that 56-year-old Madonna was using Hormone Replacement Therapy - a treatment to relieve the symptoms of the menopause

After quipping that this was 'the best episode of  CD:UK' he'd ever seen he proceeded to the audience that he had been inside Madonna's dressing room and it was full of drugs.

'I'm so excited about Madonna' he said 'I snuck into her dressing room back stage earlier and there's a lot of drugs back there.'

A stunned Karlie then tries to change the subject saying 'anyway.' but the comedian quickly interrupts with: 'But don't worry it's all HRT stuff.'

An obviously unimpressed Karlie rolls her eyes and briskly moves on by announcing the nominees for the awards before presenting the award to Simon Cowell on behalf of One Direction.

Richard Madeley tweeted his support for Madonna and even gave Jimmy a taste of his own medicine

He later tweeted that he had been impressed by Madonna's recovery after her fall

The comment that suggests that the 56-year-old singer is taking Hormone Repacement Therapy (a treatment that relieves symptoms of the menopause) has since been met with heavy critiscm from Twitter users.

Ricahrd Madeley was quick to point out his disgust at the tasteless joke and even went as far as to give Jimmy a taste of his own medicine.

He tweeted: 'I like Jimmy Carr but Jesus his HRT/drugs gag about Madonna at The Brits. Unfunny, anti-woman, cheap. Maybe his stand-up relies on Viagra.'

Other Twitter users also took to the Internet to express their disgust with the joke

Many agreed that Carr's joke had been a flop 

The presenter then added in a later tweet: 'And Madonna's recovery from a really bad fall was the perfect reply. Well done M.' 

Jimmy didn't just leave a bad taste in Madeley's mouth either with thousands of tweets flooding in criticising the comedian.

One user said: 'What's going on with the #Brits this year? So many awkward moments. Bad HRT joke by Jimmy Carr too. Let's have a go at older women shall we?'

While another tweeted their support for the singer: 'Madonna had the accident and yet it was @jimmycarr who died on stage at the Brits tonight..'

As well as his HRT gag Jimmy made another flop when he attempted to poke fun at gender equality. 

'I just think it's crazy in this day and age that we have separate awards and toilets for men and women' said Carr which seemed an equally frosty reception. 

A lot of the tweets suggested that it was the sexist nature of the joke that was most distasteful 

Other's suggested that such a bad joke could even result in the end of Carr's career

Many of the tweets shared a support of Madonna after Carr's jibe
