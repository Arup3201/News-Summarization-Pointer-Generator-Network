Split: Actor Robson Green has spoken for the first time about the breakdown in his marriage to former Page 3 model Vanya Seager, revealing that the pair haven't spoken for two years. The couple are pictured in 2000

Actor Robson Green has spoken for the first time about the breakdown in his marriage to former Page 3 model Vanya Seager, revealing that the pair haven’t spoken for two years.

Instead the couple – who have been married for 12 years and have a 13-year-old son, Taylor – communicate only by text messages.

‘I haven’t talked to her since we parted,’ said the 48-year-old former Soldier Soldier star. ‘We are in touch. But we don’t speak. We communicate by text. It’s nice and safe that way. And that’s what Taylor needs.

‘I don’t know why Vanya decided it’s better not to speak but, that’s what she has decided. It wasn’t my decision,’ he said. ‘It wasn’t me that wanted to do that. She decided. Frankly, I’m not sure how she perceives me now.’

The collapse of Robson’s second marriage is clearly a painful subject for the Geordie star, who found fame in the 1990s ITV Army drama and had a No 1 hit singing Unchained Melody with co-star Jerome Flynn.

His first marriage to occupational therapist Alison Ogilvie ended in 1999 after he had conducted a four-year clandestine affair with Pamela McDonald, the then wife of Emmerdale actor, Ian Sharrock.Robson is unwilling to lay the blame for his latest split at Vanya’s door. ‘Vanya is a lady,’ he said,  ‘She’s a great person. Just not great for me.’

He also does not blame his work schedule – which has included travelling abroad to film five series of Extreme Fishing and two of Extreme Fishing Challenge. ‘No, that wasn’t the reason,’ he said.

‘OK, maybe it is being away all the time, maybe it’s not being the greatest husband in the world, but by default that does not make you a bad father. But I try to keep my side of the street clean and I am a good dad.

‘You get to the point where you may be great as individuals but you’re not great for one another,’ he said. ‘I’ve had to explain that to Taylor.

'Vanya and I just grew apart. I don’t blame it on the career. It’s just we were different and we didn’t develop together. My mind went in one direction, hers in the other.’

While the end of his marriage is clearly a source of much soul searching for Robson, it is the separation from his son that causes him most turmoil.

‘Vanya and Taylor live in the South East now,’ said Robson, who still lives in Hexham, Northumberland – the small market town where he was born.

‘Taylor and I talk all the time but I
don’t see enough of him. The most important thing about the separation 
is not its effect on me or Vanya, it’s about how Taylor is developing. 
And right now he is developing into the most wonderful, creative, 
ambitious, competent young man.’

Robson is the Northern lad personified: from mining stock, his love for his native Northumberland is embedded deep in his DNA.

His early life was impoverished. He spent three years as an apprentice draughtsman at Swan Hunter shipyard on the Tyneside but, smitten by the smell of greasepaint at his local amateur dramatics club, he was desperate to take to the stage full time.

Telling his late father (also called Robson) that he wanted to leave the shipyard and become a professional actor was a daunting prospect. ‘I loved him but I was scared to tell him how I really felt,’ he recalled.

‘When I told him he said, “What do you mean you want to be an actor? Do you know what you are doing? You’re being paid a fortune at the yard, do you know how hard it is to get a job?” Then there was a lot of swearing.

‘I could understand his thinking. He was a big guy with hands like shovels, working in the most dangerous occupation in the world. Then I tell him I want to put on make-up and ponce about in front of a camera.’

It was Robson’s attachment to his beloved North East that, in part, may have sparked the first warning signs that his marriage to Hong Kong-born Vanya was on the rocks.

‘She never warmed to the North East, that’s the truth,’ he said. ‘She is this kind of oriental flower. She came up here and her hair would straighten in the Northern damp. But that’s not the reason we grew apart. Nothing to do with the hair,’ he laughs.

The pair met when Vanya was working as Simon Cowell’s secretary. ‘I went to his office with Jerome and there she was, the most beautiful woman I’d ever seen.’

The ten-year age gap (Vanya is now 58) meant nothing to him. When she became pregnant with Taylor, the pair decided to marry.

Vanya had, in fact, been dating Cowell. Though Cowell described her at the time as ‘too possessive’ it was rumoured he was heart-broken when she left him for Robson. In fact it was a double blow for Cowell who had just signed Robson to his then label, RAC, and made him an international star with Flynn.

It is now his TV fishing shows that are Robson’s first love. 

His Extreme series have taken him to more than 90 countries but it nearly cost him his life when he and his crew went overboard off the Cape of Storms in Canada.

‘I thought I was going to die. And I remember thinking, “I don’t want anyone else to be Taylor’s dad. I’m his dad.” ’
