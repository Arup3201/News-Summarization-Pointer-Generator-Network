Victim: The man threw his 'whimpering' collie into the sea from a pier and said: 'This is how you teach your dog to swim'. Stock image

A man who had his dog seized after hurling it into the sea will be reunited with the pet after a court heard he was 'an animal lover'.

Paul Sanders was said to have shouted: 'This is how you get your dog to swim' as he lobbed his terrified 10-year-old collie Shep from the pier at Babbacombe Bay, Torquay, Devon.

Shocked onlookers, including horrified children, screamed as unemployed Sanders, who was only wearing swimming trucks at the time, grabbed his dog and pushed it off a stone wall, plunging 15ft into the sea.

One beach goer said Torquay resident Sanders, 47, clutched the dog and chucked it over the side of the pier 'in one motion', without checking the depth of the water below.

Magistrates in Torquay were told the dog was resisting being thrown over, and was heard whimpering and whining in the water as it struggled to work out which way would lead it to safety.

Shep eventually made its way to safety and was later taken into the care of the RSPCA - along with Sanders’ six-year-old springer spaniel - after he was arrested by police.

Sanders admitted one charge of failing to protect a dog from suffering, pain, injury and disease.

Chairman of the magistrates’ bench, Anne Tully, sentenced Sanders to a six-month community order and supervision order.

She said he would likely have been sent to custody had the dog been injured.

She added: 'We find this whole incident has been disturbing for others. We do feel this was one rash moment.

'We do not condone whatsoever what you did by throwing a dog off the wall.

'I don’t think you need me to tell you that you will be watched incredibly closely.'

Speaking outside the court, RSPCA inspector Jim Farr said he was disappointed the magistrates had not imposed a deprivation order, which would have meant the dogs would be kept from Sanders.

He added: 'I am surprised. A deprivation order would have sent out a strong message to irresponsible dog owners.'

Prosecuting, John Wyatt said witnesses recalled how Sanders appeared to be drunk and was shouting at his two dogs at the beauty spot, on May 25.

A statement from witness Marie Walker said: 'He picked up the dog (Shep), it appeared to be resisting, scratching at the wall.'

'He then just threw the dog into the sea. It happened so fast that I screamed. I thought he was losing the plot.

'The dog was constantly howling, trying to get back.'

The court was told the tide was almost completely out, meaning Shep plunged into around 12 inches of water, perilously close to the rocks.

Ms Walker’s statement added: 'He (Sanders) said to me: "This is how you get your dog to swim". It was fighting to get down, pushing at the wall.

'I said: "Don’t be silly".’

'The dog was whining and disorientated. It didn’t appear to know which way to swim.'

Another witness said Sanders had told her: 'They’re my f*****g dogs, I can do what I want.'

Defending, Mervyn Williams said Sanders considered the dogs his 'two best friends', and would regularly take them to the beach to play in the water.

He had been swimming for two hours on the day of the incident, but got into a conversation with one of the witnesses as he was about to leave.

Mr Williams said: 'There was a conversation about how to teach a dog to swim. He (Sanders) said: "I will show you what my dog can do".

'Most days he will take his dog to the pier, it will run along and jump into the water.

'They (collies) are dogs which have to have a very active life,' Mr Williams added.

He said: 'This was one rash moment with one of his two best friends. It is a simple, one-off incident in which he acted unwisely.'

A reference read out on Sanders’ behalf described the defendant as 'a good and very dedicated dog owner'.

Sanders, of Babbacombe Road in Torquay, sighed with relief after he was told he would effectively be reunited with his dogs.

He was ordered to pay £500 costs.
