The family of a 79-year-old widow have attacked the ‘joke’ sentence handed down to a hit-and run-driver who killed her - after he was jailed for just six months.

Brenda Davies was hit by school caretaker Richard Thompson, 32, who had his children in the car at the time of the collision on December 3, 2012.

The pensioner had been crossing a junction when she was struck by Thompson as she walked to buy her morning newspaper at around 7.30am.

She suffered catastrophic injuries including a fractured skull and smashed ribs and even had to have her leg amputated after the smash in Rugeley, Staffordshire.

Brenda was rushed to the University Hospital of North Staffordshire in Stoke-on-Trent and was on a life support machine for a week.

The mother-of-one was transferred to Cannock Chase Hospital two weeks later but died from heart failure brought on by injuries from the accident on January 28, 2013.

Anger: Ian Mancor, Mrs Davies' son, said the sentence handed out to the hit-and-run driver was 'ridiculous'

Callous Thompson, who had his three children with him in the car at the time, fled the scene even though his BMW’s wing mirror was left in the road.

A court heard he then dropped his kids off at his sister’s and arrived at work five minutes late, but told them he felt ill and went home.

He later went on to the internet to check if there were any automatic traffic surveillance systems on the road and took no steps to notify the police about the collision.

Thompson, of Rugeley, was due to face trial this September but changed his plea and admitted causing Mrs Davies’s death by careless driving.

He also pleaded guilty to failing to stop and failing to report an accident but was given a jail term of just six months at Stafford Crown Court on Friday.

Judge Simon Tonking also banned Thompson from driving for a just two years.

Yesterday, Mrs Davies’ only son, Ian Mancor, blasted the ‘ridiculous’ sentence and said the law needed to be changed.

The 59-year-old, who lives in Stafford, said: ‘I was appalled. I was expecting a much longer sentence. The man drove off and then lied about what he’d done.

‘He was obviously guilty because innocent people don’t flee the scene. When they caught him he told lies, he denied he had been at the scene.

‘He said the wing mirror had been stolen a few weeks before.

‘I just feel that justice hasn’t been done. What worth is a human life? An old lady going about her business was run down and he didn’t stop at all.

‘He will be out in three months. And he only got a two year driving ban and he will be back on the roads.

‘It’s disgusting, the law needs to be changed. If you shoot somebody they take the gun off you and you don’t get it back.

‘A car is as lethal as a gun, but you run somebody down and you get it back in two years. It’s absurd.’

Retired social worker Mr Mancor also told how Thompson changed his plea several times, dragging the court process out for almost two years.

He added: ‘He pleaded guilty initially and then he wanted to vacate his plea. Because of that we were in court a number of times so it dragged it out.

‘It was going to go to trial in February but was put back to June. Then it was put back to September and it was only a few weeks ago that he changed his plea.

‘I don’t know why he did it but I can only presume he saw the pathologist report and knew the game was up.

‘I had to go off with stress for four months. I went back to work afterwards but I just couldn’t concentrate and went off again on long-term leave. I then took voluntary redundancy.’

Prosecutor Nick Burn told the court an eyewitness described Thompson’s black BMW ‘screaming round the bend towards me’.

Mr Burn added: ‘It’s plain she had entered the crossing when the defendant’s vehicle, travelling in the Stafford direction, was in collision with her.’

Thompson was arrested and later admitted he was the driver, but told police he was unaware he had struck a person and thought it was an animal.

Defending him in court, Steve Hennessey said: ‘He simply didn’t see Mrs Davies.’

Mr Mancor, who is single and has no children, is now writing to his MP, Jeremy Lefroy, in a bid to get the sentencing rules in cases of causing death by careless driving tightened up.

And he said his mother, who was widowed twice, had been a bright and active woman who walked a mile and a quarter every day and was a member of her local gym.

Mr Mancor added: ‘We would meet up in Stafford for a coffee and a panini and she would catch the bus in.

‘She was also a keen gardener and enjoyed doing cryptic crosswords. It was harrowing to see her deteriorate in hospital.

‘Had she lived, she would have needed 24-hour care. It was heart-rending.’

Mrs Davies worked as a museum guide and at the National Association for Widows, but was retired at the time of the horror smash.

Her first husband, James Mancor, passed away in 1977 aged 70 and her second spouse, Garfield Davies, a retired headmaster, died aged 60 in 1984 just a year after they had married.
