Resplendent in a fitted navy blue dress and a stylish pair of specs, the Duchess of Cornwall made an impassioned plea for more people to use credit unions during a speech at Clarence House today.

Camilla, 67, admitted to being 'no financial wizard' but said that credit unions 'serve people not profit' and added that it didn't take a banking expert to recognise that they can provide a 'common-sense basic banking service to ordinary people'.

The Duchess, who herself has a credit union account, was joined at the reception by people from the worlds of business, banking and politics, as well as credit union members.

Also at the reception, which took place this morning at Prince Charles and Camilla's London home, were celebrity supporters, among them Irish singer-songwriter Imelda May, TV presenter Eamonn Holmes and money-saving expert, Martin Lewis.

Speaking to guests at the reception, the Duchess added: 'I believe credit unions can change the way we talk and think about savings and loans. 

'They can encourage those who have the means to save, and bring in from the cold those vulnerable people who struggle to qualify for loans. 

'The simple fact is that if more of us support them by opening savings accounts, they will be able to offer more loans to those who really need them.'

Camilla's interest in credit unions began in 2010, when she visited North Wiltshire credit union in Chippenham.

Since then, the Duchess has visited six other unions in England, Scotland, Wales and most recently, the Assiniboine Credit Union in Manitoba, Canada.

Credit Unions are regulated, not-for-profit community banks which provide a place for their members to save money and access loans. 

They are run by their members and exist to serve them, and consequently are often very engaged with their local communities. 

In total, the UK boasts 524 credit unions with more than 1.5 million members, while worldwide, there are more than 57,000 with 208 million members spread across 103 countries.

Because there are no shareholders and they are not driven by profit, credit unions can offer very low interest rates – on average 12 per cent a year – for those seeking loans to tide them over in financial difficulties.

This compares with payday lenders such as Wonga, the country’s largest, which has charged a staggering 5,853 per cent in annual interest.

MPs, debt campaigners and the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is involved in setting up the Church of England’s own credit union, have all joined the growing clamour of critics branding short-term lenders ‘legal loan sharks’.

Camilla herself was reluctant to broach the topic of payday lenders but did encourage more to join credit unions.

'I do believe that credit unions could be a real force for change in the financial landscape,' she added, 'and are truly a cause worth championing.'

Memory: At St Ronan's School, she unveiled an astroturf pitch which will be named Shand-Ba after her brother

Enthusiastic: The Duchess was greeted by crowds of flag waving children as she arrived at the Kent school

The Duchess is in the middle of a busy run of engagements that yesterday included a visit to Kent, where she met pupils at her brother Mark Shand's former school.

The late conservationist attended Saint Ronan's School between the ages of eight and 13 and was due to return to speak to pupils before his untimely death aged 62 in New York in April.

Following the visit, during which the Duchess unveiled a new astroturf sports pitch that will be named Shand-Ba in Mr Shand's memory, she continued on to Chapel Down Winery in the nearby village of Tenterden.

There, after inspecting the vines and cutting some grapes, she was presented with a magnum of the vineyard's newest vintage, a white wine named Cuvée Camilla.
