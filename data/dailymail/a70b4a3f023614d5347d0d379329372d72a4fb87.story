Ed Miliband last night admitted his decision to knife brother David in the Labour leadership race led to a worse deterioration in their relationship than he expected.

Mr Miliband stood against his brother, the former Foreign Secretary who had been favourite to succeed Gordon Brown in 2010, and clinched an unexpected victory thanks to the backing of trade union leaders.

David Miliband refused a job in the shadow Cabinet and subsequently quit as an MP, forging a new life in the US as a charity boss.

Mr Miliband stood against his brother, who had been favourite to succeed Gordon Brown in 2010, and clinched an unexpected victory thanks to the backing of trade union leaders. Ed insisted their current relationship was a 'massive amount better than it was' but declined to speculate about whether his brother would ever take a job in a future Labour government

Of his decision to run, Ed Miliband told the Guardian: 'I knew it was a big decision at the time, but it was an even bigger decision. 

'It had bigger ramifications for my family, and for my relationship with David, than I had anticipated.'

Discussing their current relationship, he insisted it was a 'massive, massive amount better than it was', but declined to speculate about whether his brother would ever take a job in a future Labour government.

Mr Miliband also discussed his concerns about the pressures of his job on family life.

He said of his sons, Daniel and Sam, five and four respectively: 'Daniel did say yesterday, "You're always on the phone." That's what I worry about. I don't want to be an absent dad. That's a challenge in this job and it's a challenge if I'm Prime Minister.'

However, Mr Miliband's wife Justine is expected to start to feature in Labour's election campaign from next week.

The Labour leader admitted he was angry with himself for forgetting to mention the deficit when delivering his party conference speech last year.

'Well, quite rightly I kicked myself. But I'm pretty resilient,' he said.

Mr Miliband risked angering the dwindling band of Blairite Labour MPs by attacking New Labour's record.

'On inequality, I've moved Labour on from where New Labour would have been. I care about the gap between the rich and the poor,' he said.

David Cameron will today bang the drum for the economic revival achieved by the Coalition as he says voters face a ‘massive, generation-defining choice’ at the election.

He will point out that 1,000 jobs have been created every day since the Government came to power and that Britain grew faster in 2014 than any other major economy.
