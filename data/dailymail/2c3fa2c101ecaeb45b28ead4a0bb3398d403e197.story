He is the high-flying brain surgeon whose frank memoir moved David Cameron to tears over Christmas.

But Henry Marsh, author of Do No Harm, has returned the favour by accusing the Prime Minister of having ‘c**p’ policy ideas and fomenting a ‘permanent revolution’ in the NHS that demoralises staff.

Mr Marsh warns that the NHS ‘is seriously running out of money’ and says: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron . . . haven’t got a burning vision.’

Mr Cameron told The Mail on Sunday this month that Mr Marsh’s book had dominated his reading over the festive period. ‘He writes about some of his own cases, some that went right and some that went wrong. And you are moved to tears by reading this book,’ he said.

The Prime Minister told friends he was particularly affected by Mr Marsh’s story of a pregnant mother who feared she would never see her baby because of a brain tumour, but the surgeon managed to remove the tumour just before she gave birth.

Now Mr Marsh has responded by arguing that the Government has mishandled the Health Service. In today’s Mail on Sunday (below), he sets out a three-point plan to restore public confidence: admit honestly that queues will continue to lengthen unless the Government pays more for the NHS; scrap the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours; and bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations.

‘Politicians ought to stand up and say, “I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you are going to have to put up with longer queues”,’ he writes. ‘The first few hours [of the day] are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases. Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as “their” beds are filled by emergencies . . . This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos.’

The surgeon opens Do No Harm by saying: ‘I often have to cut into the brain and it is something I hate doing.’ In today’s Total Politics magazine, he attacks Mr Cameron for pledging to make ‘zero harm a reality in our NHS’ in response to the Mid Staffordshire scandal.

‘Another grouse I have against the present Government is this zero harm c**p. There’s never going to be zero harm. Nothing is perfect,’ he says, adding: ‘Most politicians now, particularly Cameron, are not really ideological. They haven’t got a burning vision . . . This constant permanent cultural revolution in the NHS is very demoralising.’

Mr Marsh is brutally honest about his own mistakes in Do No Harm. He recalls a 15-hour operation in which he tore an artery, leaving his patient in a vegetative state.

In Total Politics, he says politicians would benefit from equal frankness. ‘You know from bitter experience that . . . bad results are inevitable,’ he adds.

It’s time for a dose of honesty if you want shorter queues you have to PAY, writes leading brain surgeon Henry Marsh

David Cameron's NHS reforms have been 'chaotic', brain surgeon Henry Marsh says

By Henry Marsh

I cannot but feel flattered that the Prime Minister read my memoir of life as an NHS neurosurgeon over Christmas, as revealed by The Mail on Sunday. I am told he was very moved by it.

But I wonder whether he skipped the passages about political meddling, the constant lack of beds, and this Government’s and its predecessor’s chaotic reforms.

I hope not. Because now, as the NHS struggles through yet another winter crisis, what politicians need more than ever is a good dose of honesty.

Rather than exchanging brickbats over the latest weekly A&E figures, they should take a step back, think about what’s really gone wrong, and be straight with the public. They have been talking a lot of late about the need for transparency in the NHS – is it too much to ask the same from them?

So, after a 36-year career in the NHS that has seen five Prime Ministers and 15 Health Secretaries, here’s my advice for the current PM. First, come clean and tell voters that queues will get longer unless they are prepared to pay more for the NHS.

Second, have the courage to scrap targets – including the sacred cow of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients in four hours.

Third, bring back longer waiting lists for routine operations.

Why say these heretical things? The fact we have queues in the NHS is a simple fact of economic law. It’s about supply and demand.

The NHS is free at the point of delivery – as in my opinion it should be – which means demand is high. But it is in scarce supply. There are never enough doctors and nurses, in other words. Because there is no charge for NHS treatment – and don’t get me wrong, I do not think there should be – we end up with queues.

As our population gets bigger and we age as a nation, demand for healthcare is growing. So politicians ought to stand up and say, ‘I’m sorry, but unless you agree to pay higher taxes, you will have to put up with longer queues, particularly for non-urgent treatment.’

I hope Mr Cameron – who like me has a First in Politics, Philosophy and Economics from Oxford – understands this.

Tony Blair brought in targets in an effort to keep queues for pre-planned operations down by fining hospitals that failed to treat patients in 18 weeks. But this was a bad idea, verging on dishonest, since it implied the problem was just a question of getting staff to work ‘more efficiently’.

Yet the NHS has been underfunded relative to other developed countries for decades, and many of these other countries – such as France – are themselves now encountering similar issues.

Introducing targets is like trying to square the circle of supply and demand – an impossibility if the NHS is working flat out, as it is.

This might all sound rather theoretical. But targets have very real, unintended consequences in hospitals. For instance, because managers are always trying to hit targets for pre-planned operations, the beds are always full.

This causes endless problems, especially when we have a run of emergency cases. When I go to work each morning I never know whether I will be able to get anything done, and the first few hours are often shambolic, spent finding beds for emergency cases.

Many routine cases get cancelled at the last moment, as ‘their’ beds are filled by emergencies.

It’s like a game of musical chairs, which gets faster and faster with each year, with the Government constantly changing the music but not adding beds to keep up with the growing number who need them.

This has led to a sense of demoralising chaos, a feeling that I know is shared by an awful lot of people working in hospitals. In the past, we had long waiting lists for routine surgery. Of course, this wasn’t perfect, but at least it was honest. And it meant doctors could more easily give priority to the emergency cases, as we have to.

It’s not just targets for routine operations that have a lot to answer for. There has been a huge fuss in the press over hospitals missing the target of treating 95 per cent of A&E patients within four hours. But it’s only gone from something like 96 per cent to just under 90 per cent. That’s not bad for an emergency service. Internationally, it’s par for the course. But politicians insist on whacking each other over the head over a few percentage points.

What truly matters is that the real emergencies – strokes, heart attacks, serious injuries and in my case brain tumours – are treated promptly. I think the four-hour target has got in the way of that.

LESS well known is the target that limits how many people we admit as emergencies. If hospitals admit too many, they are penalised financially, which I find bizarre. Are we supposed not to treat them?

I take an intense personal pride in looking after my patients. I did not like having a waiting list for routine cases, but I hate even more having to cancel these cases at the last minute – it’s horrible for the patients. And it’s alarmingly easy to start becoming like a bureaucrat myself, turning the patients away and saying: ‘It’s not my problem.’

So, as much as politicians don’t want to say it and the public probably don’t want to hear it, I think we need to abolish targets and reintroduce waiting lists for non-urgent surgery, if politicians feel it is impossible to put much more money into the NHS. Are they brave enough to admit this as the General Election looms?

It was not easy to write my book and admit I have made serious mistakes in my career.

Yet I have received hundreds – probably thousands – of messages thanking me for my honesty and saying that my admission of fallibility made readers trust me more, not less. Is there perhaps a moral here for our politicians?
