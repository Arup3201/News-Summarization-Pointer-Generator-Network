The dust has barely settled since last week's launch of Apple's new iPhones, but that hasn't stopped the rumour mill starting up again - this time about the imminent arrival of a second-generation iPad mini as well as an iPad 5.

Reports suggest that Apple will launch successors to its current range of tablets at an event on 15 October, and leaked photos hint at what the tablets could look like, including a range of colourful cases.

The speculation comes as sales figures show Apple's gamble with colourful iPhones is paying off, with the pink model accounting for 46 per cent of sales - almost more than all the other colours combined.

Almost half of iPhone 5C sales are of the pink model, according to iPhoneStockChecker. The blue model is second most-popular, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales. In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales

The plastic iPhone 5C range, pictured, is the first time Apple has released its handsets in a selection of colours. The strategy was used on earlier iPods, and Apple may be looking to follow suit with a range of colourful iPad 5s, or at least more colourful cases, according to leaked images

Apple announced it has smashed its own records by selling nine million iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C handsets during the first three days - working out as 125,000 an hour, on average, or around 2083 a minute.

The tech giant also announced that 200 million devices are now running the iOS 7 software, despite download problems and divided opinion.

Last year's iPhone 5 sales topped five million during its opening weekend in September 2012, yet only one handset was available - as opposed to this year's two - and it wasn't sold in China from launch.

Reports from iPhoneStockChecker.co.uk found that the blue model is the second most-popular device, accounting for 32 per cent of 5C sales.

In third place is green, at 12 per cent, followed by white at 9 per cent and yellow brings up the rear, accounting for just 1 per cent of sales.

Apple could be looking to take this strategy into the iPad part of the business. Experts have already said there could be at least two new iPads released as soon as next month.

Apple is yet to officially confirm the date of its next product launch, but analysts have begun pointing towards the 15 October.

During the iPhone announcement on 10 September, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said: 'Our teams are hard at work on some amazing new 
hardware, software and services that we can’t wait to introduce this 
fall and throughout 2014.'

The current iPad mini came out in 
November 2012 and if Apple follows suit, this would suggest a 
mid-October announcement followed by an early-November sale date, all in
time for Christmas. 

The price of the current iPads is also being cut in various regions, suggesting a new tablet is coming.

A new range of iPads are expected to launch on 22 October. These leaked images from technology site Tactus, allegedly show the rear shell of the iPad 5, pictured, with coloured cases. Apple could also unveil a second-generation iPad mini

It's likely the iPad mini 2 will keep the current 7.9-inch screen and not drop to 7-inches, in a bid to stay slightly bigger than Google's Nexus 7 and Tesco's new Hudl.

If Apple adds the Retina display seen on its new iPhones and larger iPads, its possible the second-generation iPad mini will be heavier and thicker.

However, leaked photos of casing suggest it will be thinner - suggesting Apple will wait to add the high-definition display to later models.

According to Apple site, 9to5Mac, the rumoured iPad 5 will also keep the 9.7-inch, high-resolution screen seen on older models.

The camera is due an upgrade and is 
rumoured to move to an 8MP rear-facing lens, with the possibility of 
even a 12MP camera being added.

Leaked images from Tactus additionally suggest the iPad 5 will be thinner than its predecessors.

Technology site Expert Reviews believes Apple will stick with its traditional pricing strategy for both models and charge the same price for its new products as it did for the outgoing models.

For example, the 16GB iPad 5 is expected to cost around £399, this raises to £479 for 32GB and £559 for 64GB.

If Apple additionally follows its 
iPad 4 launch and introduces a 128GB iPad 5 model, this should start at 
around £639 for 128GB, while 4G-ready models will cost more still.

Similarly, the iPad mini is expected 
to launch with at around £269 for 16GB and then in £80 increments for 
the 32BG and 64GB models. Models with 3G and 4G access will cost more.

Because the colourful iPhones have proved so popular, case manufacturer Mophie has created a range of cases in purple, green, pink, red and blue for the older iPhone 5.

The cases are known as Juice Packs because they can also be used to give the phone a battery boost.

Mophie claims the cases offer 80 per cent more power.
