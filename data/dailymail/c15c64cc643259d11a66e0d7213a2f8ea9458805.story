Bereaved bikers in Virginia can now order a Harley Davidson hearse to bear their deceased loved ones.

Funeral home owner Michael Turch rolled out the venture at his three funeral homes to give citizens of Alexandria and Dale City, Virginia, a more unique option. 

And with two services in the first week, the custom-built 2014 Harley Davidson Road King is already a hit.

'When I pull in the parking lot, people will literally turn around and drive into our parking lot and take pictures,' Turch told ABC News.

'I've been here 24 years and no one has ever stopped me with any of my other hearses and said, "Hey, when I go, I want to ride in this."'

The first time it was used, last week, was for a woman who had never ridden a Harley in her life but her family felt it would be a memorable way to say goodbye, Turch explained to Inside Nova.

The second was for a Harley Davidson mechanic.

'His family just thought it would be perfect,' he said.

It is not the first time a Harley Hearse has taken to the streets.

Firms in Pennsylvania and New York have had Harley funeral options for years.

In fact, it was when one of these Harleys was brought over to Dale City by a visiting family that Turch became inspired to join the trend.

'We had a family about six years that had one - they found it on their own,' he said.

'And over the years, everyone would comment, hey, remember when you had that motorcycle hearse? So that resonated with me.'

'Nobody's going to remember the box or the urn years from now, but if you create a meaningful ceremony they'll remember that,' he added.

Unique: Turch said he wanted to offer customers something special to say goodbye to their loved ones
