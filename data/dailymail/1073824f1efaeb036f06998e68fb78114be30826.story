Prosecutors were accused of pursuing a vendetta against four Sun journalists yesterday after they announced a retrial in a deadlocked case that has cost millions.

After a three-month hearing at Kingston Crown Court, jurors failed to reach verdicts on the journalists, who were accused of paying public officials for information.

The Crown Prosecution Service has put a number of journalists on trial after investigations into phone hacking and corruption, but several recent cases have ended in acquittals or hung juries.

Concerns have been raised about the millions spent on the cases and the length of delays between arrests and trials, with one journalist waiting more than three years.

Labour MP Keith Vaz, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said it was ‘deeply disappointing’ that the Sun journalists’ trial was still not completed.

The committee would address concerns raised by the case, he added.

Tory MP Tracey Crouch said: ‘These journalists have had their lives turned upside down while they awaited trial for over three years, and then after three months of court time and a bill of several million pounds to the taxpayer, the CPS wants to drain millions more from the coffers because they didn’t get the result they wanted.

‘They are a joke and rather than pursue this vendetta, they should concentrate on bringing real criminals to justice.’

Former Sun managing editor Graham Dudman, 51, head of news Chris Pharo, 45, former deputy news editor Ben O’Driscoll, 38, and reporter Jamie Pyatt, 51, were accused of paying police officers, prison guards and a worker at Broadmoor Hospital. 

They all deny any wrongdoing over the alleged payments.

The newspaper’s picture editor John Edwards, 50, and former reporter John Troup, 49, were cleared of corruption. 

The jury also cleared O’Driscoll and Dudman of some charges, but failed to reach verdicts on the remaining counts against them.

Judge Richard Marks praised the ‘great dignity’ of the defendants and said the retrial must be scheduled this year so their wait for justice was not delayed further.

Media lawyer Gavin Millar QC, of Matrix Chambers, said vast amounts of public money would be wasted, but there was ‘no realistic prospect of conviction’.

The CPS said it would be inappropriate to comment ahead of a retrial.
