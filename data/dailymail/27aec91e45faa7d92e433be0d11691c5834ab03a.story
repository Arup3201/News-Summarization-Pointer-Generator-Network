Two fraudsters cheated concert promoters out of millions of dollars by pretending to organise gigs by stars such as Rihanna and Lady Gaga, a court has heard.

Vincent Carroll and Meceo McEaddy allegedly made more than $2million from production companies around the world which paid them to set up concerts that would never take place.

The pair spent their ill-gotten gains on an international luxury lifestyle, splashing out on cars, hotels and expensive jewellery, according to prosecutors in New York.

'Scam': Two men are accused of pretending to organise concerts by Rihanna and Lady Gaga

Carroll, 47, and 38-year-old McEaddy are accused of posing as middlemen with close links to Lady Gaga, Kesha and Rihanna.

They were yesterday indicted by the Manhattan district attorney on charges of grand larceny and felony fraud.

The alleged scammers are accused of promising Brazilian concert promoters that Rihanna would perform in Rio de Janeiro, and charging an advance fee of $1million.

Claims: Another allegation centres around Kesha, who was supposedly booked to perform

They also allegedly agreed that Lady Gaga would perform at a private party in Mexico in exchange for a pavement of $650,000.

A third charge read out in court yesterday related to a supposed concert by Kesha, whom Carroll and McEaddy allegedly pretended to represent.

District attorney Cy Vance said in the indictment: 'These defendants are charged with selling concert promoters around the world a false bill of goods.

'Rihanna's Please Don't Stop the Music could be an anthem for the legions of disappointed fans who heard about her concert in Brazil, only to learn that it had to be cancelled before tickets even went on sale.

'The defendants capitalised on the popularity of three of the most famous pop stars in the world to steal more than $2million from event promoters. My office will continue to root out and prosecute those who abuse their victims' trust for their own profit.'

During the initial court hearing, the judge raised laughter when it emerged that he had not heard of some of the stars mentioned in the scams.

When a prosecutor mentioned the fake Rihanna concerts, the judge said: 'Who is this?', according to the New York Post.

As Lady Gaga's name cropped up, he said, 'Lady Gaga, Iâ€™ve actually heard about - a relative of mine went to the same high school as she did.'

However, the judge admitted 'I don't have a clue' about Kesha.
