South Africa have still never reached the final of an ICC Cricket World Cup after losing at the semi-final stage for the fourth time in a nail-biter with New Zealand, doing little end their tag as chokers.

The Proteas won their first ever knock-out match in a World Cup against Sri Lanka for the chance to meet the Black Caps at Eden Park but fell in a thrilling match reduced to 43 overs each in Auckland.

The set New Zealand 298 courtesy of 50s from AB de Villiers and Faf du Plessis but had their hearts broken when Grant Elliott, who was born in Johannesburg, hit a six to win the match with a ball to spare.

When it really mattered, they fumbled two clear run-out chances and then saw JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien collide in the deep when Eliott skied one with 14 needed for victory.

1996 QUARTER-FINAL VS WEST INDIES, KARACHI, PAKISTAN

West Indies legend Brian Lara celebrates his century against South Africa in 1996

When Brian Lara dragged West Indies to 264 with a classy 111 in a fast even for modern standards 94 ball, with help only from a young Shivnarine Chanderpaul with 56, it was a gettable total for the South Africa. 

And they looked to be making short work of it as they cruised to 118 for one at the halfway mark.

However, a spectacular collapse sparked by Windies' left-arm spinner Jimmy Adams saw a very different story emerge. 

Opener Andrew Hudson went for 54 for the second wicket, Daryll Cullinan followed two runs later for 69. 

Captain Hansie Cronje showed some resistance with 40 before he became Adams' third scalp. 

Fellow spinner Roger Harper then took over in Karachi, ripping through the middle order of Jonty Rhodes, Brian McMillan and Shaun Pollock, and then knocked over one of their two proper tail-enders in Steven Palframanfor.

When Courtney Walsh knocked over Paul Adams' stumps the Proteas fell short on 245.

1999 SEMI-FINAL VS AUSTRALIA, EDGBASTON, ENGLAND

South Africa and Australia ended tied on 213, but the Aussies’ record in the Super Six stage saw them advance to the final.

Lance Klusener appeared to be leading the Proteas to victory, smashing Damien Fleming for successive fours in the first two balls of the opening over to equal Australia's total. 

With four balls remaining, South Africa needed just a single. Alan Donald was almost run out by Darren Lehmann trying to back up too far at the non-striker's end. 

Then, farcically, with two balls remaining, Klusener hit a ball straight past the bowler and ran safely to the danger end. However, Donald stood his ground his ground and their near-certain win became another prematures World Cup exit as Adam Gilchrist whipped off the bails.

2011 QUARTER-FINAL VS NEW ZEALAND, DHAKA, BANGLADESH

South Africa should have been more than capable of chasing down New Zealand’s total of 221, and much like 1996 against the Windies were cruising to victory at 108 for two.

But then came another collapse of monumental proportions. 

Jaques Kallis (47) was a big loss for the third wicket at 108-3, before spinning opener Nathan McCullum claimed JP Duminy and AB de Villiers was run out for the fourth and fifth wickets on 121.

Faf du Plessis' attempt to lead them home ended on 36 as the ninth wicket fell for 172, their final score when Morne Morkel was dismissed by Luke Woodcock.
