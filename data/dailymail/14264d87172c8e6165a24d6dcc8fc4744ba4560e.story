Britain currently has one of the highest rates of hay fever in the world with about 25 per cent of the population suffering. It is believed that the number of sufferers is likely to more than double to 32million by 2030.

The Met Office spokesman said: 'Starting with this weekend and early week, the general theme is similar to what we have now. Good, fine weather with outbreaks of rain in the north west.

'Showers will drift southwards today with conditions getting increasingly cloudy by the end of the day.

'The rest of the week we can expect a lot of fine weather. For the next few days it looks as though high pressure will be in charge throughout the UK.
