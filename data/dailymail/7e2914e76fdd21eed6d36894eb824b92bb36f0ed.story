Murder detectives admitted today they were no closer to finding the killer of a frail 93-year-old pensioner who died after being savagely beaten as she lay in bed.

Emma Winnall suffered horrific head injuries and was left with a partially-severed finger following the brutal attack at her flat in Moseley, Birmingham.

Birmingham Coroner Louise Hunt has now concluded at an inquest that the grandmother-of-seven was unlawfully killed - as police said they had no suspects.

Shocking: Emma Winnall, 93, suffered horrific head injuries and was left with a partially severed finger following the brutal attack at her flat in Moseley, Birmingham

The coroner told Mrs Winnall’s family: ‘She was unlawfully killed because it is the assault that let to her sad death. I am sorry as a family you have had no true sense of justice in this case.

‘The police have carried out an extensive investigation to identify a suspect. If future evidence comes to light I am sure they would pursue the matter with some vigour.’

The court heard the pensioner was put to bed on the night of April 30, 2012, at her flat by carer Nina Joshi, who then left and locked the door.

But when she returned at 8.30am the next day Mrs Winnall was screaming from her bed and was found covered in blood.

Daughter Joyce Blencoe told the inquest: ‘Her head was bleeding and I couldn’t understand that, her hair was covered with blood, it was all down the side of her head. Her pillow was soaked with blood.

'I lifted back the cover, her left arm was twice the size it should have been, her little finger was severed and just hanging there. She said someone had tried to murder her'

‘I lifted back the cover, her left arm was twice the size it should have been, her little finger was severed and just hanging there. She said someone had tried to murder her.’

Mrs Winnall was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital nearby where she remained until her death on May 29 from pneumonia.

Detective Inspector Justin Spanner from West Midlands Police said there was no clear motive for the attack and added anybody who entered the property that night must have used a key.

And while forensic investigators found blood spattered on the wall around her bed, the officer said no secondary blood transfers were found anywhere else in the flat.

He said: ‘I have investigated a number of murders and this is the exception. Not to find a secondary transfer of blood is very unusual.’

DI Spanner added: ‘The police investigation has not identified any witnesses to an assault and there is no CCTV evidence that identified any persons responsible. Forensics has not identified a suspect. There are currently no suspects.’

Charity Crimestoppers and Midland advertising executive Trevor Beattie had offered a £10,000 reward to help find the killer. Anyone with information is urged to call police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
