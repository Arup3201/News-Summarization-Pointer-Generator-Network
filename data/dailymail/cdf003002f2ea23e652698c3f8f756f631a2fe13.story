Clamour: Nick Clegg claims that he was too young at the time of Smith¿s vile acts to have known about them

Nick Clegg was facing a growing clamour last night to reveal what he knew and when about the Cyril Smith paedophilia scandal.

The Lib Dem leader, who had issued glowing tributes to the 29-stone MP, said yesterday that he was too young at the time of Smith’s vile acts to have known about them.

But politicians and child protection campaigners said his denial was not credible given the evidence that Smith’s activities were widely known in Westminster and his Rochdale constituency. And senior Lib Dem Vince Cable conceded last night there could have been an establishment cover-up of ‘paedophilia on a very large scale’.

Allegations against Smith were published in magazines in 1979 and aired publicly at an election hustings in 1987, while prominent Liberals confirmed they had heard the rumours over many years.

Yet Mr Clegg described Smith as a ‘beacon’ and an ‘inspiration’ on his 80th birthday in 2008, and said he was ‘deeply saddened’ at his death two years later.

He tried to withdraw those remarks yesterday when faced with the Daily Mail’s revelations about how the predatory MP’s serial abuse of vulnerable boys as young as eight was covered up.

The Lib Dem leader said: ‘I would never have dreamed of saying the things that I said if I was aware of the truly horrific nature of the actions which he is alleged to have undertaken over a long period of time.’

He added: ‘Cyril Smith stood down as an MP 13 years before I became an MP. Many of the actions, the repugnant actions, which we now learn about took place well before the party I now lead even existed – in fact, took place before I even existed.

‘Given those facts and that chronology, it is – as my party has made quite clear – not surprising that the Liberal Democrats, who were founded in 1989, two or three years before Cyril Smith stood down, were not aware.’

But critics rejected Mr Clegg’s bizarre defence, pointing out that his party evolved out of the old Liberal Party and most Liberal MPs and activists became Lib Dems.

The Lib Dem leader said: 'Cyril Smith stood down as an MP 13 years before I became an MP.' However, critics say the abuse was well known in Westminster and in his Rochdale constituency

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, 
said: ‘That’s a pathetic excuse – as pathetic as you can get. They are 
the same party. Clegg really needs to show some leadership on this.

‘I don’t believe that they knew nothing. The Liberal Democrats need to hold their own investigation into what they knew and what they covered up.’

Business Secretary Mr Cable told ITV’s The Agenda: ‘It is horrific, it is really horrible. Let’s remember this was a very long time ago. We’re talking 40-50 years ago.

'This is the (Jimmy) Savile era. I was actually a member of the Labour Party when all of this happened. I’ve no personal recollection of it.’

Asked whether the case was an establishment cover-up, he said: ‘That’s the suggestion. These are allegations. They are very serious. This is criminal paedophilia on a very large scale.’  

Peter Saunders, chief executive of the 
National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘I would have
 thought that somebody of the stature of the leader of the Liberal 
Democrats would at least find out what they needed to find out before 
making a statement about such a controversial figure.

'I have lost count of the number of people I have spoken to in the last 24 hours who said it was well known how dodgy Cyril Smith was.’

He added: ‘It is incredible that they should be denying this now – what that will be doing is rubbing salt in the wounds of his many victims as well as survivors generally.’

Former Lib Dem MP Lembit Opik said Mr Clegg could not ‘wash his hands’ of Smith’s abuse because it happened before he took over the Lib Dems.

He added: ‘If you’re leader of an organisation, you have got a responsibility to know what is going on in it. You can’t simply hide behind history and say it was none of your business.’

A devastating new book by Rochdale 
Labour MP Simon Danczuk discloses how politicians, police and the 
security services left Smith free to molest children for four decades. 
Fresh revelations from the book serialised in today’s Daily Mail 
include:

Smith was a 
leading figure in a paedophile ring which carried out sickening abuse at
 Knowl View, a school for boys with learning difficulties in Rochdale.

The MP called for police to raid the home of a whistle-blower who went public with claims that pupils as young as eight were being subjected to extreme sexual abuse.

In 1979, the Rochdale Alternative Press newspaper printed allegations that Smith had abused  young boys, which were repeated by the national satirical magazine Private Eye.

David Steel, then Liberal leader, was told about the claims. His spokesman responded at the time: ‘All he seems to have done is spanked a few bare bottoms.’

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who lifted the lid on Cyril Smith’s crimes, has accused the BBC of ‘extraordinary bias’ in its coverage of the affair.

BBC News ignored the Mail’s Saturday front-page revelations, only to change tack 24 hours later, when Smith’s family said they were ‘saddened and concerned’ by its publication. In a hostile report, the BBC website said the family believed Mr Danczuk was ‘motivated by political and financial gain’.

The Labour MP, who is sending a formal complaint to Director General Tony Hall, said: ‘Here we have a book showing that Cyril Smith was a paedophile for more than 40 years, and the BBC’s first reaction is not to ask why it was covered up, or to look at the horrors his victims went through and the lives he ruined. Instead, they ask whether the bloke who wrote it is biased. I’m flabbergasted.’

Mr Danczuk added: ‘The fact that this story is being led by the Daily Mail has driven the BBC to take a particular view. It’s hugely disappointing. If this book had been serialised by the Guardian, it would be leading their news bulletins.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘[Cyril Smith] is an ongoing story that we have covered extensively in the past, and will continue to report on as and when there are developments that warrant it.’

Smith’s alleged abuse of boys was also publicly raised during the 1987 general election campaign by his Labour opponent, David Williams.

Mr Williams told the Mail: ‘Everyone in Rochdale had heard rumours about him, and I believed they should be properly investigated. Perhaps it was dirty politics on my behalf, but Cyril Smith was a dirty politician, so I decided to do it.’ Mr Danczuk says that Smith’s ‘penchant for boys’ was an ‘open secret’ and widely discussed in bars around Parliament.

Michael Meadowcroft, a Liberal MP from 1983 to 1987, has said  that ‘whispers’ that Smith ‘liked boys’ circulated in Westminster.  Liz Lynne, Smith’s successor as  Lib Dem MP for Rochdale, said  she heard ‘inklings of rumours’  but defended Smith to her friends and colleagues.

She added: ‘I never saw any evidence of impropriety – if I had,  I would have gone straight to  the police.’

Despite clear evidence that Smith’s sickening activities were well known, a string of senior Liberal Democrats have insisted they had were taken by surprise when his abuse was exposed after his death. A spokesman for Charles Kennedy, the former Lib Dem leader, said he ‘absolutely and categorically denies any knowledge of any such allegations’.

Baroness Shirley Williams, a founding member of the SDP and now a Lib Dem peer, added: ‘I went to Harvard in 1986 as professor at the Kennedy School and did not return until 1996, so I cannot comment on rumours about Cyril Smith or what actions if any were taken in those years.’

Lord Steel, who put Smith forward for his knighthood, has not commented on the revelations.

Solicitor Alan Collins, from law firm Slater and Gordon, who is representing a number of Smith’s victims, said there was a discrepancy between the mounting evidence that the MP’s abuse was widely known and the Lib Dems’ claims of ignorance. He added: ‘The story I don’t think is going to go away because there is this mis-match that doesn’t make sense.’
