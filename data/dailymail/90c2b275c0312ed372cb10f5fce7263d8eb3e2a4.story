A new computer programme that lets users take the form of anything - from a cute red panda to a horned demon - is set to make video chats more fun this year.

FaceRig will allow users to adopt the appearance of an assortment of characters, which immediately mimic their expressions when chatting online.

The software, which has been demonstrated ahead of being released, captures facial expressions using an ordinary webcam and reproduces them on the face of a chosen avatar in realtime.

The FaceRig software, which has yet to be released, allows users to adopt the appearance of any character, such as this red panda, which immediately mimics their expressions in online chats

The software tracks a person’s expressions and head movements.

It extracts tracked data to apply the animation on a 3D model that a user has selected in realtime.

The software uses a normal webcam and can work alongside video chat services such as Skype as well as in web cast games.

Users can alter the sound of their voice and even use a karaoke mode.

People can change the way their avatar is lit as well as any props they might carry.

They can choose characters including a Japanese school girl, a horned demon and a red panda.

This technology will allow users to ‘become digital actors on a virtual movie set’.

Developed by five ex-game developers in Bucharest, Romania, the programme will be able to be used with Skype or any other webcam service when it is released.

It will go on sale by August for as little as $5 (£3) for early adopters, although the price will rise as the programme becomes more sophisticated.

Developers Holotech Studios claim they have created the world's first mass-marketed expression capture software.

The early version of the service could be 
used in web chats and webcast games and will allow users to change their 
voice, choose environments and ‘dramatic lighting’ as well as create 
their own props and characters to share with friends.

The software, which is still in development stage, uses state-of-the-art realtime image tracking technology created by Swedish firm Visage Technologies and combines it with a realtime animations framework developed by their own company, Holotech Studios, along with other partners in the gaming industry.

Realtime tracking collects and analyses data about a person’s facial expressions and head movements to apply the information onto a 3D model or avatar, such as a red panda.

The software also encodes the video and audio output from a webcam to intercept and swap the images captured by the real webcam and the avatar.

The team of scientists said: ‘A lot of research has been put into FaceRig by top level academics and professionals to create the current results.’

The current version of the software slated to be released this summer is intended for home use, but the company is also working on a version that could be used by businesses as well as a mobile version for iPhones and Android handsets.

All users will need to do to use the package is download the software and sit in front of their webcam, according to the company.

Depending on the success of their Indiegogo campaign, the team plans on supporting more sensors so that avatars can track torso and waist movements as well as gestures made by arms, hands and fingers.

They said a future version of the software could even track brainwaves to pick up on the subject’s excitement so the avatar can show accurate pupil dilation or blushing.

The crowd funding campaign has already exceeded its $120,000 target by pulling in $211,615 of investment.

‘Ultimately we want to enable anyone to become any digital character they wish, head to toe, with Hollywood/Pixar quality, during any real-time online interactions, video and audio,’ the developers said.

‘But this is super-long term. Right now we're starting with emotions [and] expressions on FaceRig,’ they added.

While the current version of the software (set to be released before August) tracks head movements and facial expression, a future version could see avatars replicating whole body movements and tracking brainwaves to pick up on the subject's excitement so the avatar could show accurate pupil dilation or blushing
