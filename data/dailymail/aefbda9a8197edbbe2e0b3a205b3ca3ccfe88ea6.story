Australians living in Britain are heading home where employment opportunities are at an all-time high.

Known as the ‘boomerang effect,’ research has shown that Australian and New Zealand expats are sick of the miserable job market in the UK where unemployment was recently at a 17-year peak.

The research, done by jobs website Track Me Back, found that the positive outlook at home is enticing expats to return.

Caroline Rafferty, the general manager of the website said: ‘People returning home have usually worked in multiple cities globally and are now returning to work in Australia because there are better job opportunities and the economic outlook is more positive.

‘Many of our expats left home 10 years ago with a backpack, thinking they'd be gone for six months. 

Plenty of jobs at home: There are better opportunities at home with Australia's economy growing 'remarkably', boosted by the mining and construction industries

‘Now they're returning with a spouse and a family, and they're looking to settle at home for the long-term.’

Immigration figures from the Home Office showed that the number of Australians coming to the UK for employed had dropped by 35 per cent over the last three years. The number of New Zealanders fell by 40 per cent.

The UK's dismal economy is all doom 
and gloom with a national debt of 85 per cent of the GDP as compared to 
23 per cent in Australia and 37 per cent in New Zealand.

Australia has been recognised as one of 
the fastest growing economies in the world and in July the country 
celebrated 21 years without recession, the longest period of time any 
country had gone without recession.

In stark contrast to the UK, which has a GDP growth rate of -0.8 per cent, Australia is enjoying a growth rate of 4.3 per cent.

Chris Richardson, director of Deloitte Access Economics said: ‘As far as the statistics can tell us that is a record for any nation at any time.’

He said Australia’s economic growth is ‘remarkable’ and predicts its growth, driven largely by mining and construction, will continue.

As a result there is currently an industry-wide, high demand for skilled workers to work in Australia, making it a very attractive destination for expats who have struggled in the flailing UK job market.

According to the latest Manpower Employment Outlook survey for this year, Australia is in desperate need for more skilled workers, with more than half of 2,200 local employers surveyed in Australia having great difficulty in filling critical jobs.
