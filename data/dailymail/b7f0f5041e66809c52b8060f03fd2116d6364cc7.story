An heir to the multi-billion dollar Ainsworth poker machine fortune is paying just $125 a week in child support for a daughter he has spent two hours with this year, the toddler's mother says.

Peter Ainsworth is the grandson of pokie king Len Ainsworth, whose personal worth is estimated at $2 billion, but he has little time or money for his 16-month-old daughter Grace, according to his former partner Alice McClure.

Ms McClure told A Current Affair she to struggles to pay the rent on her modest unit in Sydney's eastern suburbs while Mr Ainsworth, the director of a technology company, seemingly leads a carefree life of international travel and luxury.

'I don't understand how you can just walk away from your daughter...' Ms McClure told A Current Affair. 'I mean walk away from me, that's absolutely fine I don't have a problem with that. Absolutely fine.

'But just to walk away from Grace, she's such a beautiful girl and she looks exactly like him, she's just beautiful, it'd be nice if he came to see her but he saw her for two hours this year.'

Ms McClure says Mr Ainsworth reported a taxable income of $22,894 - or $440 a week - to the Child Support Agency in 2013. She claims he pays her $125 a week, rarely on time.

'She's such a beautiful girl and she looks exactly like him,' Alice McClure says of her daughter Grace and Grace's father Peter Ainsworth 

The pair met through their mutual interest in triathlon but the relationship did not work out. 'Two months after she was born he took off,' Ms McClure said. 

'He's a different person now, I just didn't ever think he would... I didn't think he was capable of this.'

'I'm not after his money. I just want him to spend time with his beautiful girl. To see Grace. That's all. Come and spend some time with her.'

Ms McClure said Mr Ainsworth, 30, was in Melbourne last Father's Day with his current partner, former cocktail waitress Alysha Maree.

She had offered them both the chance to spend some time with Grace. 'I just didn't get a response,' she said.

'Something's got to change. It can't keep going on like this.

'It's been really hard to be honest. Trying to survive as a single mother isn't easy.'

While her former partner enjoys fine dining and overseas travel to destinations including Fiji, Ms McClure cannot afford to eat out at all. 

'I've got a little girl, for me to go to a restaurant I have to organise a babysitter and that's $20 an hour. There's no way I could afford it,' she said

Peter Ainsworth's father Stephen is a multi-millionaire businessman and well-known yachtsman. His grandfather, Len Ainsworth, founded Aristocrat Gaming and is the majority shareholder of Ainsworth Game Technology, a booming poker machine company. 

Len Ainsworth recently said company turnover was up 40 per cent in the past six months compared with last year. 

The Ainsworth family owns a mansion in Wolseley Road, Point Piper, one of Australia's most exclusive streets.

Mr Ainsworth lives a life of luxurious travel but had a taxable income of $22,000 last year

When Peter Ainsworth appeared in Waverley Local Court charged with cocaine possession in July 2012 he described himself as unemployed. He pleaded guilty to that offence, committed at the Woollahra Hotel, and was placed on a good behaviour bond. 

Mr Ainsworth is believed to be holidaying in New Zealand. Daily Mail Australia rang the legal firm which represents him and was told by a man who answered the phone that his solicitor was unavailable. 'He's out on the harbour sailing,' the man said.
