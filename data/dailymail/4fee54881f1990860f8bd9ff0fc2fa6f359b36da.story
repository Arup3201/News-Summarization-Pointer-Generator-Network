Mario Balotelli showed he's up for his home Liverpool debut against Aston Villa with an upbeat Instagram message praising the 'great' supporters and team. 

The Italian striker is set to lead the attack in the absence of the injured Daniel Sturridge, and he uploaded a post to the social network to hint at his excitement about pulling on the red shirt at Anfield for the first time. 

The 24-year-old had been a doubt with a bug which forced him to train away from the first team on Thursday but manager Brendan Rodgers said he should be fit to start.  

Up for it: Mario Balotelli is excited about making his Anfield debut for Liverpool 

Tactics: Balotelli in deep discussion with new manager Brendan Rodgers 

Balotelli said: 'First game at Anfield today! We'll try our best to win this game! 

'Need a lot of support but we already knew that it wouldn't miss! 

'Great supporters! Great team! Great Liverpool! Come on guys!'

Rodgers confirmed that Balotelli had shaken off the bug which caused him to miss training.

Impact: The striker put in an impressive performance on his Liverpool debut at Spurs

New surroundings: Balotelli moved to Liverpool in a £16m deal from AC Milan last month 

He made a big impact in his debut at Spurs two weeks ago and the Liverpool boss will be delighted to have the striker's services at his disposal, especially given Sturridge's absence. 

Rodgers said: 'Mario had a bit of a bug that we wanted to make sure he didn't spread around the group.

'But he'll be ok for Aston Villa.'
