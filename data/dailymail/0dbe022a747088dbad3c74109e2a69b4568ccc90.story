Former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit has revealed his surprise at Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal's failure to sign 'any good central defenders' during last summer's transfer window.

Gullit believes his fellow countryman failed to replace  Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand despite spending over £150million  during his first few months at the club.

Defenders Marcos Rojo, who has been deployed at centre back for a large part of the season, and Luke Shaw were brought in from Sporting Lisbon and Southampton respectively - however neither player were seen as ready-made replacements for Vidic and Ferdinand.

Ruud Gullit believes Manchester United should have signed Mats Hummels during the summer window  

Louis van Gaal was 'crazy about Hummels', according to former Chelsea manager Ruud Gullit 

Gullit insists Van Gaal should have signed Germany and Borussia Dortmund  centre back Mats Hummels.

Speaking to Goal at Heineken's #ChampiontheMatch event, Gullit said: 'The only thing for me that is a surprise is Van Gaal didn't buy any good central defenders - that had to be his priority.

'He was crazy about Hummels and wanted to buy him. So I would have bought Man United some good defenders because that was the weakest link.

'For me, that they did not was a surprise. Nevertheless, he gets results. The more results he gets, the more confidence they get and the better they will play.'

Manchester United dropped down to fourth spot in the Barclays Premier League after their 2-1 defeat at the hands of Swansea City on Saturday.
