More than 200 pet rats were removed from an Ohio apartment after their owner was evicted.

Animal control officers who rescued the rodents on Thursday said some were in cages while
others roamed free and were living in holes in the walls and inside a 
mattress. They said the smell was 'awful'.

The rodents' owner, John, contacted the Humane 
Society of Greater Dayton after he was evicted from his Kettering studio and could no longer care for them.

Feral: More than 200 pet rats were rescued from a Kettering apartment in suburban Dayton, Ohio on Thursday

Rescuer: Sheila Marquis, an animal officer from Humane Society of Greater Dayton, worked with a team to remove more than 200 pet rats from an awful-smelling Ohio apartment

'They make great pets for children. They are very durable and they are very sweet and very nice; however, you don’t want to have 200 of them,' animal officer Sheila Marquis told Dayton Daily News.

'What becomes a problem is, you have one or two and with small pocket pets like that, if you don’t spay and neuter, they breed quite rapidly.'

Marquis said the rats begin breeding at three-months-old and have 
litters of 13 or more several times a year.

She said no charges are expected because the owner reached out for help and the rodents were well cared for.

The owner's neighbor Darryl Tucker said the man loved his pets.

'And you know, he just chose to raise rats. He’s real close to his rats, he can tell you anything about them,' he said.

Breed rapidly: Humane Society of Greater Dayton said there might even be as many as 300 of the rats
