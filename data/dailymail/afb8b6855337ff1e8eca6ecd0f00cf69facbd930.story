A retired math teacher from Colorado is still missing after he went off in search of his wife of 54 years during last week's floods and hasn't been seen since.

Gerry Boland’s overturned pickup truck was later found in the river near his Lyons home, but his family aren’t ready to give up hope despite the hundreds of people still unaccounted for.

As water recedes and flows east onto the Colorado plains — revealing toppled homes, buckled highways and fields of tangled debris — rescuers are shifting their focus from emergency airlifts to trying to find the missing.

Hope: Gerry Boland has been missing since he went to look for his wife of 54 years Cheron after they became separated in last week's floods

Cheron believes Gerry turned back at some stage to look for her when she could not find him at the meeting point: 'I guess he wanted to see if I went home,' she said

Worried: Gerry Boland's daughter Amy Hoh cried as she revealed the family have not given up hope he will be found

Aftermath: Victims of last week's devastating floods retrieve belongings outside a home near the East Platte River east of Greeley, where the area's broad agricultural flatlands were especially hard hit by the high water

Federal and state emergency 
officials, taking advantage of sunny skies, said more than 3,000 people 
have been evacuated by air and ground, but calls for those emergency 
rescues have decreased.

Gerry Boland's neighbors, all of whom 
defied a mandatory evacuation order, said Boland took his wife to safety
on Thursday then tried to return home.

Two search teams went looking for him on Monday.

His wife of 54 years Cheron today spoke to NBC about the last time she saw her husband.

After the evacuation order, the couple took two cars and got separated on their way to the shelter.

Cheron believes Gerry turned back at some stage to look for his wife.

'I guess he wanted to see if I went home,' Cheron said.

When she realized he was not at the meeting point, she got back into her car so she could back to look for him.

That's when her vehicle stalled in the rushing water. Rescue crews came to her aid in the only vehicle that could reach her, a front-loader.

'Two or three people got out in 
wetsuits, put a life jacket on me and sat me on the seat in all the mud 
and away we went,' she said.

Scour: Staff Sgt Jose Pantoja looks from the open door of a Blackhawk helicopter for people in need of help near Jamestown as the focus is shifted towards finding the missing

Search and rescue: SFC Keith Bart helps a woman who was winched up to a helicopter outside Jamestown, Colorado, which was cut off due to flooding

Federal disaster area: Colorado authorities have
warned that the death toll is expected to rise from historic flooding 
in the state, the presumed total now stands at six

More than 1,200 people are missing in the flood 
zone, which has grown to cover an area covering nearly 4,500 square 
miles (11,655 square kilometers), nearly the size of the U.S. state of 
Connecticut

Neighbor Mike Lennard said: 'He was very sensible. I find it amazing
that he would do something that would put himself in harm's way. But you just never know under these 
circumstances.'

The state's latest count has dropped 
to about 580 people missing, and the number continues to decrease as the
stranded get in touch with families.

Officials reported six flood-related deaths, plus two women missing and presumed dead.

The number was expected to increase. It could take weeks or even months to search through flooded areas looking for bodies.

With
the airlifts tapering, state and local transportation officials are 
tallying the washed-out roads, collapsed bridges and twisted railroad 
lines.

The rebuilding effort will cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take months, if not years.

In one of the searches yesterday, Sgt
1st Class Keith Bart and Staff Sgt Jose Pantoja leaned out the window 
of a Blackhawk helicopter, giving the thumbs-up sign to people on the 
ground while flying outside of hard-hit Jamestown.

Most
waved back and continued shoveling debris. But then Bart spotted two 
women waving red scarves, and the helicopter descended.

Pantoja
attached his harness to the helicopter's winch and was lowered to the 
ground. He clipped the women in, and they laughed as they were hoisted 
into the Blackhawk.

After dropping off the women at the 
Boulder airport, the Blackhawk was back in the air less than a minute 
later to resume the search.

Lost and found: A Boulder County Animal Control officer, and workers from the Humane Association work to rescue a cat from a destroyed home as the flood water recedes

Recovery: As water levels receded on Monday emergency responders began to assess damage in some areas

Initial assessments have begun trickling in, but many areas remain inaccessible and the continuing emergency prevents a thorough understanding of the devastation's scope.

Northern Colorado's broad agricultural expanses are especially affected, with more than 400 lane-miles of state highway and more than 30 bridges destroyed or impassable.

A Colorado Department of Transportation helicopter crew has been surveying damage, said department spokesman Ashley Mohr.

County officials have started their own damage tallies: 654 miles of roads in Weld County bordering Wyoming, 150 miles of roads in the Boulder County roads foothills, along with hundreds of bridges, culverts and canals.

Dale Miller, road and bridge director for Larimer County, said it could compare to the damage wrought by a 1976 flood that killed 144 people. It took two years to rebuild after that disaster.

State officials have put initial estimates at more than 19,000 homes damaged or destroyed throughout the flooded areas.
