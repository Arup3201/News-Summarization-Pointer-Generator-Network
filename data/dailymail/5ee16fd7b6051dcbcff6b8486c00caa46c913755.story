BBC host Nick Robinson has apologised after posing for a photograph with a candidate standing for a far right party.

The Corporation's political editor was criticised online after smiling in the picture with Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First – a spin off from the British National Party.

He admitted he made a 'mistake' while covering the Rochester and Strood by-election overnight.

Journalists descended on the Kent town to cover the by-election triggered by the defection of Tory MP Mark Reckless to Ukip.

Mr Reckless won the seat by 2,920 votes, in a major blow for David Cameron Conservatives. 

Ms Fransen was among 13 candidates standing in the seat. While votes were being counted, she asked Mr Robinson to pose for the photograph.

The image was then posted on Britain First's Facebook page. 

Critics on Twitter said the picture was 'shameful' and suggested Mr Robinson should resign.

Writing on the social media site, Mr Robinson said: ‘Lesson of the day. Never agree to have selfie taken without first checking who's asking. Shame but my mistake.’

Ms Fransen secured just 56 votes in the by-election, behind the Monster Raving Loony Party. 

Mr Reckless beat Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst, with Labour pushed into third. He follows Douglas Carswell into the Commons, after he became Ukip's first elected MP after defecting in August.

The Liberal Democrats continued a humiliating string of by-election performances, finishing fifth behind the Greens with just 349 votes and losing another deposit. Turnout was 50.67 per cent.

The picture was taken at the count at Medway Park in Gillingham where the result of the Rochester and Strood by-election was announced

Mr Reckless was later sworn in as Britain's second Ukip MP in the Commons.

He declared that Ukip will 'give you back your country' after winning his seat by 2,920 votes, erasing the Tory majority of almost 10,000 that he secured in 2010.

In his acceptance speech, Mr Reckless said: 'If we can win here, we can win across the country. If you vote Ukip, you get Ukip.'

Jubilant Nigel Farage punched the air and declared that the 'massive, massive' win in what he called a 'David v Goliath battle' meant 'all bets are off' for the general election in 2015.

The result is embarrassing for David Cameron who just six weeks ago tore into Mr Reckless and vowed to kick his 'fat a***' out of the Commons. 

Today the Prime Minister insisted he is 'absolutely determined' to win the seat back at the general election.
