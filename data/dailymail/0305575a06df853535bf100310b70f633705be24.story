Kris Boyd has been spared a two-match ban after the head-butting charge laid against the Rangers striker was ruled not proven.

The Ibrox frontman was issued with a notice of complaint by new Scottish Football Association compliance officer Tony McGlennan after clashing with Hibernian defender Jordon Forster last month.

But he has now been cleared to play after the judicial panel decided there was not enough evidence to suspend the 31-year-old during a Hampden hearing.

Boyd squared up to Forster towards the closing stages of the Ibrox encounter with his side trailing 3-1 then appeared to push his head into Forster's face.

Light Blues-team mate Bilel Mohsni has already been hit with a three-match ban after admitting he had lashed out at Hibs' Liam Fontaine during the same game.

Tunisian Mohsni - who appeared to argue with his own supporters as he headed down the tunnel at half-time - was cited for swinging an arm at Fontaine after the Hibs defender knocked the ball out of his hands as he raced back to the halfway line following Nicky Law's 55th-minute consolation strike. 

Boyd is now free to line up for Rangers against Raith Rovers after the international break
