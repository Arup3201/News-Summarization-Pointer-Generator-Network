A student shamed after she was too fat to fit on a rollercoaster has lost an incredible eight stone so she can finally ride on Colossus.

Thrill-seeker Emma Cooper, 24, from Ashford in Kent, was enjoying a day out at Thorpe Park when she found the harness would not shut over her size 24 figure.

After the embarrassing experience she embarked on a drastic weight-loss journey kick-started by a three-month specialist diet programme.

Now that Emma has gone from her heaviest at 20 stone to just 12, she has returned to the theme park to triumphantly take on the white knuckle ride.

Emma said: 'It was the most embarrassing moment of my life - I couldn't believe that I was too big to pull the barrier down.

'I knew I had to do something and it is great thinking that I'm now plenty slim enough to go on any rollercoaster I want!'

The marketing student had been trying to lose weight since arriving at Plymouth university weighing 20 stone. Six years later Emma, whose university course is four years long, has taken two gap years and is currently in her placement year, healthier and happier.

Despite considering a gastric band aged just 18, she decided to try and lose weight alone and managed to shift some of the excess pounds by cutting out crisps and chocolate.

But the final straw came when she climbed on to the ten loop rollercoaster for a friend's birthday and could not buckle the barrier.

After the embarrassing theme park incident, size 24 Emma vowed to lose the excess weight for good.

She said: 'I have quite good self-control when it comes to buying food for myself, it was just my portion sizes.

'I never really ate unhealthily - I just ate a lot.

'My mum had a gastric band fitted and I was considering one before I went to university but I realised that I had my whole life ahead of me and I wanted to try and lose weight by myself.

'The turning point was when I went to Thorpe Park for my friend's birthday and I couldn't fit under the harness.'

Emma signed up for Diet Chef in June 2014. The weight loss programme provided her with breakfast, lunch and dinner for three months.

Emma ditched giant meals and late-night McDonald's for vegetable soups and nutritious pasta dishes as well as taking up running.

She dropped three stone in just three months taking her to 13st. 

After the programme Emma realised she enjoyed the Diet Chef food and the way the meals helped her to manage her portions, so she has continued to incorporate them into her diet and has lost an extra stone since then. 

Emma would eat three portions at a time and arrived at university weighing 20 stone. She managed to shift some of it on her own by buying smaller bowls and plates to trick her brain into eating less

Her commitment to healthier eating meant she shrunk from 16 to 12 stone and now wears a slim size 10. Emma's weight loss was gradual initially. It was only when she started Diet Chef that she properly started shopping again, and can now buy slinky outfits for glam nights out.

To celebrate her incredible transformation she headed back to Thorpe Park to ride the ten loop coaster.

Emma added: 'I love rollercoasters and I was gutted I couldn't get on. But mainly it was the shame that I had to walk off in front of everyone as the ride went round.

'I love going fast and the thrill of a rollercoaster - I was the only person that would go on it with my friend - and I just had to get off and watch as the ride went round without me. 

Emma has transformed her life - and her look - after shifting the final four stone

Breakfast: Triple-size bowl of cereal

Lunch: Two large sandwiches and crisps

Dinner: Extra-large pizza with energy drinks and ice cream

Snacks: Late night burger and chips and a multi-pack of crisps

Breakfast: Regular-sized bowl of low-sugar cereal

Lunch: Diet Chef pasta bowl - only 236 calories

Dinner: Gammon steak with grilled veg

Snacks: None 

'While I was at uni I tried to lose weight gradually by making small changes.

'I even bought smaller bowls and plates to trick my brain into eating less because sometimes I was eating three times a normal portion.

'Doing Diet Chef helped me so much and it took this huge chunk of weight off.

'I used it to teach myself what normal people eat and how much they eat.

'And it was great going back to Thorpe Park knowing I wasn't going to have a problem taking on Colossus as many times as I wanted!'  

Emma now wears a size 10 and likes to experiment with glamorous and girlie looks
