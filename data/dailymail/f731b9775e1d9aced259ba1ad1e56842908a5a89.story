These pictures reveal what life is like inside Brazi's most notorious and dangerous prison.

At least 75 inmates have died in the Pedrinhas Prison Complex since 2013, National Council of Justice claims.

And three people were brutally beheaded in the complex that year during violent riots which claimed 60 lives.

Heavily armed military police keep a constant and watchful eye on the prisoners homed within the walls in Maranhao state.

At least 75 inmates have died in Pedrinhas Prison in the Maranhao state in Brazil since 2013, making it one of the most violent on the planet

During one riot, three inmates were decapitated after two rival gangs broke out of their cells and went on the rampage 

Despite the presence of heavily armed officers, equipped with ballistic shields, shotguns and CS gas, the inmates were able to rampage

Long term neglect allowed the number of damaged cells to increase which in turn allowed inmates freedom to roam the entire facility

But some of the unrest inside the complex in Sao Luis has cooled recently following efforts from a new state administration, prison officials and leading judges from the state.

Much of the violence stemmed from damaged cells which allowed inmates from rival gangs to mix in the prison's open spaces.

Officials have recently repaired and repopulated the cells which allows the military police guarding the facility to move more freely.

They claim there have been no prisoner-on-prisoner killings in the complex for nearly four months and violence is decreasing.

Other reforms include a policy of custody hearings and real-time camera feeds.

Brazil has the fourth-largest prison population in the world with around 550,000 people behind bars - when almost 800,000 spaces are needed

Justice officials say that more spaces will be needed to cope with the rising number of arrests for even minor drug offences 

Military police are forced to patrol the sprawling prison complex, ready with pump-action shotguns, semi-automatic handguns and gas

Overcrowding was believed to be one of the primary causes of rioting and violence in Brazil's prisons. 

Additionally, densely packed complexes strengthened prison gangs which now span the country and control the suburbs of cities such as Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo and Sao Luis, where the Pedrinhas Prison Complex lies.

Brazil has the fourth-largest prison population in the world behind the Russia, the U.S. and China.

The number of prisoners has quadrupled in the past twenty years to around 550,000 and the country needs at least 200,000 new spaces to eliminate overcrowding.

Even though the prison is an incredibly violent place, some of the inmates have been granted special privileges such as using art tools

Some of the prisoners' art works are displayed on the walls to entertain fellow inmates, although the subject matter is not surprising 

A vast increase in minor drug arrests, a lack of legal advice for criminals and a lack of political will for new prisons have contributed to the increases.

In October 2013,  prison gangs inside the complex in north-eastern Brazil left 10 dead and 30 injured in a violent uprising.

Rioting broke out between rival factions and spilled out into the city centre where marauding supporters torched seven buses and besieged the local hospital.

The mutiny started after several prisoners refused to allow wardens to carry out an inspection of their cells. 

However, it is not all men who are detained inside the prison, as it is home to female inmates - some of whom are heavily pregnant

The pregnant women give birth inside the jail and some of them are allowed to keep their children with them behind bars 

The men and the women are kept separate from each other although authorities are unable to prevent all attempts at fraternising 

The situation rapidly escalated into a confrontation between the officers and the detainees. 

And according to the Latin Times, at least 36 inmates managed to escape from Pedrinhas in September the following year.

Several of them stole a dump truck which they used to knock down a wall in the facility.

Four of the prisoners were able to steal the vehicle, which was inside the prison complex because of ongoing construction, and they rammed it into the outer wall to open up an enormous hole.

According to the Justice and Prison Administration Secretariat of Maranhao, authorities arrested a 19-year-old man for his alleged involvement in stealing the truck and helping the inmates escape.

As part of the the efforts to reduce tension inside the prison, inmates have been offered special exercise regimes

Also, many areas in the prison are covered by CCTV systems, which can alert authorities immediately to any potential problems
