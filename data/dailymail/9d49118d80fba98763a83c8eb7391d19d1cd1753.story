Former Premier League winger Simon Davies is now playing for a village team in Wales... and will pay £3 to take part in each match. 

Solva FC, an amateur side in Davies' hometown, unveiled the ex-Everton and Tottenham winger as their new marquee signing on Tuesday - but the midfielder will have to pay to play.

The former Wales international only turned 34 in October but has been without a club since leaving Fulham in 2013.

Davies was encouraged to join the club by his brother, who is captain of the Welsh side.

Speaking to the South Wales Evening Post, Davies said: 'I'm looking forward to playing a few games with my brother and the friends I started playing with all those years ago. 

Tracey Cole, club secretary at Solva, said: 'It's a big signing for the club.

'I've already told him I'm not paying him - he's going to have to pay subs like everyone else.

'He seems keen and hopefully he'll be available for a few matches.'

Starting his career with Peterborough United, Davies moved to Spurs in 2000 but struggled with injuries during his five-year spell at White Hart Lane.

The Welshman moved to Everton following the Toffees' top four finish in 2005 but struggled for form on Merseyside before moving to Fulham in 2007.

Davies spent six years at Craven Cottage and played a key role in Fulham reaching the Europa League final in 2010. The midfielder scored in the semi-final against Hamburg and against Atletico Madrid in the final - which Roy Hodgson's side lost 2-1.

Davies, who earned 58 caps for his country, joined Dean Saunders as a pundit for Sky Sports' coverage of Wales' 2-1 win over Andorra on Tuesday night.
