A pregnant woman with severe learning difficulties should be forced to have an abortion, the High Court will be told this week.

Doctors are applying for an order to allow them to terminate her pregnancy as they say it is endangering her life.

The woman, whose identity is kept secret for legal reasons but is described as having 'significant learning impairment', has had a series of strokes because she suffers from sickle cell disease.

Case: The mentally disabled woman should be forced to have an abortion, the High Court will hear

Medics say she does not have the ability to make the decision herself and have described the need for an abortion as 'urgent'.

Condition: The unnamed woman has sickle cell disease, where red blood become deformed (pictured) and can clog blood vessels causing breathing problems and even strokes

The woman's sickle cell disease is very serious and the baby must be 
terminated very soon to reduce the risk of her losing her life, they say.

Her condition means that her red blood cells develop abnormally, preventing oxygen being supplied around the body properly.

The cells' shape can also clog blood vessels, affecting 
breathing and leading to anaemia, severe respiratory problems, strokes 
and in some cases death.

Around 250,000 people in the UK are believed to have it, and it is more prevalent among ethnic minorities.

The case will be argued by an NHS trust in southern England in the Court of Protection, sitting at the High Court in London.

Until recently the Court of Protection sat in secret and is charged with ruling on 'life and death' cases where patients are deemed incapable of making a decision themselves.

But it has also been criticised for some of the rulings it has made.

The authorities have previously stopped a dementia patient going on the holiday of a lifetime because it was deemed too dangerous and forced another individual to use contraception.

This latest case contrasts the plight of Savita Halappanavar, the
Indian dentist who was refused an abortion of her dying foetus in Ireland.

She later died of blood poisoning and the case led to heated debate about whether abortion should be legalised in certain circumstances.
