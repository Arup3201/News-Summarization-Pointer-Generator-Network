Los Angeles mail carriers have an increasing number of reasons to watch where they step.

The U.S. Postal Service named the city the worst in America for dog attacks on letter carriers last year while urging pet owners to help reduce the attacks on an estimated 4.5 million Americans annually.

The agency on Wednesday released its city rankings ahead of National Dog Bite Prevention Week, which starts Monday, May 19.

The Postal Service said that overall 5,879 postal workers were attacked last year, an increase of 274 dog bite incidents compared to 2011.

Top 15: Mail carriers in Los Angeles reported 69 dog bites with the second runner-up of San Antonio, Texas having seen 42

Watch out! Los Angeles was the worst city in America for dog attacks on letter carriers last year according to the United States Postal Service

Los Angeles was the worst with 69 
attacks, followed by San Antonio with 42 and Chicago with 41. The city 
with the least attacks was Wichita, Kan., with 20.

According to the American Veterinary Medical Foundation, nearly 1 out of every five people bitten will require medical attention, accounting for more than 800,000 Americans - half of which are children.

'Several of our letter carriers know first-hand about both the prevention and the pain of animal attacks, and we want to do whatever we can to help educate the community â€” especially parents and pet owners,' the USPS said in a release.

If letter carriers feel threatened by a dog, they can skip delivery to the house and ask the customer to retrieve any mail at the post office instead.

Claims: A similar ranking of dog bites and their claims by State Farm insurance shows the state of California having had the most bites and paid claims, nearly double of Illinois' which came in second place

Similar to the USPS' report, California on a whole had the most dog bites and related paid claims according to those filed with State Farm insurance in 2012.

In contrast, dog bite claims nationally dropped with the company.

In 2012 the insurance company reported 3,670 dog bite claims, a slight decrease from the 3,750 seen in 2011.

Nationally the insurance company made more than $108 million from dog bites with California's $17.1 million nearly doubling those seen in  runner-up Illinois.

State Farm's report also comes in collaboration with the National Dog Bite Prevention Week.
