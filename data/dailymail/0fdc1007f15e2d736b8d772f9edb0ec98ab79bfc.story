He is ‘excited and charged’ by his new multi-million dollar job with the Weather Channel.

But Sam Champion feels betrayed by people inside ABC whom he considered ‘friends’ after a string of ‘mean-spirited digs’ following his exit from Good Morning America, MailOnline can reveal today.

A source close to the star said:  ‘Sam was with ABC for 25 years, when he did the goodbye show at GMA he felt good about walking out the door.

‘But
 then came these digs by people that throughout his career he would have
 called friends and he doesn’t understand why – or what’s in it for 
anybody.

'This is a lot harder than I thought it would be': Champion bid a tearful farewell to his Good Morning America team on December 4

Champion and Elliott hugged it out at the end of the show as they said a tearful goodbye on December 4

The former weatherman on the hit ABC 
breakfast show made his last on-air appearance just six days ago and 
hugged co-star Robin Roberts while Josh Elliot wept during his emotional
 exit.

However, since his 
departure, Sam, 52, has been subjected to reports he is power crazed – 
and that he left ABC purely as a money-making venture.

And
 a source close to Sam revealed the attacks are upsetting during a 
particularly ‘joyous’ time in his career – adding he is particularly 
upset that his husband Rubem Robierb has been dragged into it.

Sam’s new job makes him the on-air 
face of the Weather Channel, based in Atlanta, appearing as host and 
serving as Managing Editor.

‘He had his first 
day at the Weather Channel yesterday and he’s excited and charged and 
had the best day ever and these ridiculous stories don’t make any sense 
at all,' said the source.

While Robin Roberts, 53, 
has recently signed a massive new deal with ABC, TV chiefs are 
currently negotiating new contracts with GMA stars Josh Elliot, Lara Spencer and 
George Stephanopoulos – all of whom have deals up within the year, 
leaving the network in somewhat of a perilous situation at the top-rated morning show in the U.S.

Sam has kept in touch 
with ‘one or two’ of his GMA pals since leaving, but the friend said: 
‘There’s a lot going on with them and they are in negotiations, he wants
 to step away while there is this negative gossip.

‘His
 tactic is that he needs to focus on his new job. And he wants them to 
make the best decisions for their lives and careers. ‘

Sam Champion has been with the ABC network since 1988 as weather host

For
 Sam, according to his friend, what is upsetting are reports that ABC 
were lining up his replacement Ginger Zee months ago as they believed he
 was unhappy at the network.

However,
 the source said: ‘Here’s the thing, Sam’s contract with ABC was up at 
the very end of November. He went to ABC in late summer and said ‘let’s 
start talking’ as he wanted to know he had a future at the network

‘They didn’t start talking until the first few weeks of November, which is when the Weather Channel deal came up.

‘It wasn’t a long-range plan, it wasn’t anything that had been going on for a year, that’s just not true.

‘He
 never saw the opportunity coming, but this is what he loves, he tried 
for years to convince the network that weather is news and it’s 
important.

‘The Weather Channel already knows this and they want to more. Sam thought ABC understood this.‘He told them he would try to make everyone happy and make everyone look good.’

The
 source added: ‘It was joyous for Sam, he didn’t see why anyone should 
feel bad – he went and told everyone he loved them and walked out the 
door and the next morning comes this mean-spirited attack, like being 
punched.’

Attacking claims 
that he merely wanted to leave in an exercise to be able to licence his 
image on products like coffee mugs, the source insisted: ‘Sam’s deal 
with ABC wasn’t exclusive.

‘If he had wanted to licence merchandise he would have - all he needed was ABC’s approval.

‘He didn’t bolt to make all kinds of crazy money.’

Sad goodbyes: Champion (far right) bid farewell to the rest of the GMA team on December 4 (L-R) Josh Elliott, Robin Roberts, George Stephanopoulos and Lara Spencer

Upset: Sam Champion is said to be most upset his husband Rubem Robierb had been used in digs against him since leaving ABC. The couple are seen on their honeymoon

And
 discussing rumours that Sam’s husband Rubem, 36, had persuaded him to 
leave GMA as he refused to leave his hometown of Miami – so they could 
start a family , the source said: ‘It’s not fair to bring Rubem into it.

‘He would never have demanded that Sam leave ABC, if they were going to have babies Sam would be on the same schedule.

‘Rubem had never even been to Atlanta before yesterday.'

Ironically, in his new role, Sam 
now joins forces with his former rival, Today weather co-host Al Roker, 
whose one-hour Wake Up With Al airs on The Weather Channel weekdays at 
6am (EST), then repeats at 10am.

Champion's new morning show will be tucked in between, airing from 7 to 10am. And Sam will also be in the partial employ (in a sense) of his old 
network rival: The Weather Channel is owned by a consortium made up in 
part of NBC Universal.

But interestingly,
 the first person to send Sam a text of support when he announced his 
departure from GMA was Mr Roker.

Champion was in fits of laughter as tapes from the ABC archives were brought back to haunt him on his last day on GMA

Sam Champion and Josh Elliott became very emotional as they said goodbye on their last breakfast show together

Ginger Zee, who was on the ground in Denver, Colorado, on December 4 to cover the severe winter storm, has taken over from Champion as weather presenter at GMA

Al,
 59,  who hosts Wake Up With Al on the Weather Channel and sent a text 
saying ‘Congratulations, you’re going to love this place!’

The
 pair already plan lunch when Sam’s back in New York City and the source
 said: ‘They’ve known each other for 25 years, Sam knows Al’s wife and 
family and they socialise together.

‘Sam is not going to Today, he’s doing a 2/3 hour breakfast show on the Weather Channel.

‘‘Sam
 doesn’t understand why ABC can’t be happy for him – they have a great 
show, great talent and they don’t need to dig at him. He just wishes 
them the best.’'
