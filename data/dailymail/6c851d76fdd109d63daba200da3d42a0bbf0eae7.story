Reform: Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has decided criminals who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving Britain

All prisoners are to be banned from travelling abroad for up to 12 months after being released.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has decided that, for the first time, the 50,000 criminals a year who are jailed for less than 12 months will be prevented from leaving Britain if released on licence or under a ‘supervision period’.

Mr Grayling said some of those released would also be prevented from moving around the country and would need permission from probation officers to spend a night away from their ‘approved’ residence. 

He believes that criminals released after short sentences should not be able to enjoy foreign holidays and should focus instead on finding a job in their local community.

‘We want to help offenders help themselves.

'If they are to finally step out from the gloomy shadows of criminality, they need to be given every chance,’ said Mr Grayling.

‘Sometimes that will mean taking a firm position and restricting someone’s movements. But it is for the purpose of giving them a better chance in life and helping them become law-abiding members of their community.’

Under current rules, anyone given more than a year in jail is banned from travelling abroad for 12 months and are returned to prison if they break the terms of their licence.

Mr Grayling wants to apply this to those released after short sentences, such as disgraced former Cabinet minister Chris Huhne, who served two months behind bars.

Passports will not be confiscated but prisoners on licence are expected to report regularly to their probation officers.

Former inmates will only be allowed to travel abroad in ‘exceptional’ circumstances, such as attending a close relative’s funeral.

Foreign travel prohibition for prisoners released after short sentences is being introduced in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, and can now be imposed as part of a community order or suspended sentence order.

Mr Grayling has also ordered a review of the sentencing regime, introduced by Tony Blair a decade ago, which allows all but the worst offenders to be released halfway into their sentences.

Instead of being freed automatically, the most serious violent and sexual offenders will have to earn the right to be released by taking classes or working while behind bars.

Private firms and charities are also to be paid to provide mentors, including reformed prisoners, to meet every offender at the prison gate and help turn them away from a life of crime.

In the biggest shake-up of prisoner rehabilitation for more than a century, Mr Grayling is to pay organisations if they prevent inmates reoffending after release.

The move has infuriated probation officers, who say 70 per cent of their work will be put out to tender and they claim that it would put public safety at risk.

Mr Grayling will insist that radical steps are needed to address high reoffending rates which mean almost half of all prison-leavers are reconvicted within 12 months.

For those serving less than a year that figure is almost 58 per cent.
