Missing: Kimberly Lindsey, 49, a school nurse, was last heard from on Sunday night after she texted one of her daughters to let her know she had returned home safely from a trip

The three daughters of a Florida woman who mysteriously disappeared on Monday are begging the public and authorities to help find her.

Kimberly Lindsey, 49, a school nurse, was last heard from on Sunday night after she texted one of her daughters to let her know she had returned home safely from a trip.

But the next day she did not show up for work at Bak Middle School of Arts in West Palm Beach and has since been missing without a trace.

School officials reported her missing on Monday and deputies conducted a welfare check at her Palm Beach Gardens home. They found her vehicle, and personal items in the home.

‘The minute she didn't walk through 
the door I knew that I needed to find out because she did not contact me
and I would have been the first person she would have contacted,’ said 
Roberta Azrak, Lindsey's friend and co-worker.

Lindsey's three daughters, Sarah, 20, Sophia, 18, and Savannah 16, are holding out hope that she will be found alive.

‘It's heart-breaking to be away from her. It's harder than anything that we've ever been through and

it's really scary not knowing what's happening and we will do anything to bring her home,’ Sarah Lindsey told ABC News.

At a press conference Thursday, Sarah described her mother as a ‘self-made, independent woman,’ who was a ‘nurturing’ and ‘loving’ mother.

‘Memorize her face. Keep her in your head. Look for her. Do anything you can you never where she might be,’ she said.

She was last seen wearing this green T-shirt, which is a shirt her daughter Sofia also has

The family has set up a Facebook page, Find Kim Lindsey, to aid in the search and handed out hundreds of fliers.

Lindsey, according to her daughters, was last seen wearing a green T-shirt with the words Explore, Dream and Discover written on the back.

Investigators are offering a $1,000 reward for information in the case.

‘We believe she's endangered,’ said the sheriff's spokeswoman Teri Barbera. ‘We're very concerned for her well-being.’

Lindsey and her ex-husband, Albert Lambert, were still having issues after the divorce earlier this year. The ER doctor is pictured here with their three daughters

Earlier this year, Lindsey got a divorce from her now- ex-husband, emergency room physician Dr. Albert Lambert, according to CBS 12.

According to court documents, Lindsey has claimed Lambert is slow with paying child support, and has not come through with money for her car, as spelled out in the divorce judgement. 

Lambert, who works as a contract physician in the ER at Florida Medical Center in Broward County, says Lindsey hasn't paid rent on the house they once shared. A woman at the center, who picked up calls, said the doctor was not in.

The family is holding a vigil open to the public tonight at 6:30pm at the 9/11 Memorial at 5161 Northlake Blvd. Palm Beach Gardens.
