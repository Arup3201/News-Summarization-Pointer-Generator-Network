A horrific fire swept through a mobile home on Sunday morning claiming the lives of a mom’s five young children along with her boyfriend in Tiffin, Ohio.

Anna Angel, 30, was working a shift at the local Burger King when she received news that there had been a fire at her home in the Highland Trailer Park, about 50 miles southeast of Toledo.

The victims have been identified as Ms. Angel's boyfriend, Timothy Fresch, 25, their young son Domanic Fresch, 1, and Ms. Angel's children Trinitie Huey, 4; Sunshine Huey, 3; Stormie Huey, 5, and Tiara Angel, 6.

Firefighters extinguish a mobile home fire on Sunday morning after pulling a man and five children from the home, who were pronounced dead at a local hospital

Local emergency services received a 911 call shortly before 8 a.m. and were dispatched to find part of the trailer fully engulfed in flames.

Fire crews pulled the man and the children from the home, and all six were taken to Tiffin Mercy Hospital, where they were later pronounced dead, police said. 

They are understood to have died of smoke inhalation. There is currently no information as to what caused the fire.

Ms. Angel went to the hospital to identify her children and gave each a kiss goodbye, reports The Blade. She was not allowed to see the body of her boyfriend because of the severity of his burns.

She had been at work about two hours at Burger King when the trailer park manager called and said there had been a fire at her home.

Nancy Williams, who manages the Highland Park Estates mobile home park and lives there, said she yelled to her son to call 911 and ran to the home when a neighbor alerted her to the blaze.

‘I knew there were babies in there,’ she said. ‘But once we got there, there was nothing we could do. It was fully engulfed in flames and we couldn't get in.’

Williams' voice broke as she described seeing rescuers bringing the children from the home. ‘It's so heartbreaking,’ she said.

Another neighbor, Rick Hummell, 49, said he went to see if he could help but even firefighters had a difficult time getting inside the home at first due to the smoke and flames.

‘I watched the babies get dragged out,’ Hummell said. ‘It just made me sick.’

Hummell said he often saw the children outside and would give them money for ice cream.

‘Every time the ice cream truck came through, we'd say, “Here, get yourselves something,’” Hummell said.

The fire burned quickly, breaking out windows and peeling some of the trailer's aluminum siding, Hummell and Williams said.

A stroller, a little pink bicycle and an adult bicycle with a bike trailer attached to the back could be seen outside the home with its charred and broken windows.

Hummell said the woman would often load up the trailer with the children and ride through the mobile home park.

‘She was always good to her kids,’ he said.

Police said emergency responders were at the home within minutes after the fire was reported.

Harry Miller, chief of the Bascom Joint Fire District outside Tiffin, said about 30 members of his volunteer department assisted the city department. He said the fire was knocked down fairly quickly, and his crew had left the scene after an hour or two.

Miller noted that fires involving children are among the most difficult for firefighters to handle, especially for those new to the job.

‘We had some new EMTs on the scene as well, and it's very tough on everyone when it involves kids,’ Miller said. ‘It hits home because we all have kids.’
