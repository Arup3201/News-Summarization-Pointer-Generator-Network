Fatal: Thorin Montgomery,17, was the first to hold a loaded .38 caliber handgun to his head and pull the trigger

A teenager has died after shooting himself in the head during a game of 'Russian Roulette' with three friends.

Thorin Montgomery, 17, was the first to hold a loaded .38 caliber handgun to his head and pull the trigger.

The teenager collapsed in front of his horrified friends who called paramedics.

Montgomery was airlifted to hospital where he later died from his injuries.

Russian Roulette is a lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against his or her head and pulls the trigger. 

The game originated in Russia and featured in the one of the most famous 
scenes in cinema history in the film The Deer Hunter with Robert De Niro
and Christopher Walken.

It is estimated that up to ten people a year die from playing the risky game.

Police in Largo, Florida, said Montgomery was with three friends, aged 19,18 and 16, on Friday night when they decided to play the deadly shooting game.

The teens were sitting on the back porch of Montgomery's home when the fatal shot was fired.

A neighbour, who doesn't want to be 
identified, told 10 News he saw an ambulance arrive at the house and 
then neighbors started running towards there as well.

He described the scene as 'crazy' and said he was surprised to hear the teens were playing such a dangerous game.

'I'm shocked to find out they're stupid enough to play that game,' said the neighbor. 

'Kids nowadays, with them playing with guns the way they do, there's no reason for that.'

A spokesman for Pinellas County Police said the investigation was continuing and they were focusing on how the teens obtained the gun.
