Among the spectacular terrain of the Andes mountains, there should have been plenty of opportunities to capture footage that would dazzle viewers.

But while explorer Sir Ranulph Fiennes was prepared for almost any eventuality on the trip, it seems he may not have been prepared to leave such things to chance.

The adventurer has been accused of faking accidents with the help of an Oxford graduate to make his expedition look more exciting on television.

Sought compensation: Miss Harrison sued the travel company that supplied the guides after claiming they should have stopped her taking part in the stunts

Sir Ranulph, described as ‘the world’s greatest living explorer’ by the Guinness Book of Records, wanted to show a dramatic fall as he crossed a glacier but did not want to perform the stunt himself, the Court of Appeal heard.

Natalie Harrison said he suggested over dinner that she should perform the fall instead, and she agreed.

Miss Harrison, now 38, was filmed for a television documentary as she jumped across a glacier crevasse but pretended to fall short, leaving her dangling from her climbing ropes.

She said the glacier stunt caused long-term headaches and a second staged fall, during a mountain climb, left her with soft tissue damage to her neck.

Sir Ranulph, who was the first person  to have climbed Mount Everest and crossed both polar ice caps, sent her a £200 cheque for four osteopath sessions after she contacted him about her neck injuries from the trip to Ecuador.

Miss Harrison, of Portland, Dorset, took legal action against the holiday company which provided guides for the expedition and told the Court of Appeal the firm owed her a ‘duty of care’ and should have stopped her from performing the stunts.

Sir Ranulph, 68, was not directly involved in the court battle but lawyers claimed the staged falls were his idea.

The court heard that the former Army officer invited Miss Harrison on the expedition to the Cotopaxi region of Ecuador as a ‘thank you’ for work she had done on his 2003 book, Scott of Antarctica. US television network HBO sent a cameraman with them as they headed across the Andes in October 2004.

Lord Justice Pitchford said: ‘Sir Ranulph suggested they should undertake a staged fall which would be captured on camera. The victim would fall into a crevasse. Miss Harrison volunteered to be the victim.

‘She would jump a crevasse, fall slightly short and be held suspended on climbing ropes by the guides. The stunts were suggested as an exciting piece of footage by Sir Ranulph Fiennes. Miss Harrison was present at supper when this was discussed.

‘Sir Ranulph Fiennes did not want to do the stunt himself, that is why she volunteered. She volunteered freely and without compulsion.

‘Sir Ranulph Fiennes wanted to secure some exciting footage with the cameraman in attendance. It was his idea but he didn’t want to perform it himself.’

During the first stunt, the crevasse leap, Miss Harrison’s head hit the wall of the glacier and she claimed it had caused long-term headaches. In a second faked accident, she pretended to fall while climbing and said it caused a soft tissue injury to her neck.

Her lawyer Sarah Prager said the guides provided by climbing holiday firm Jagged Globe were asked to provide for her safety and to supervise the expedition. She told the court: ‘They failed to prevent those stunts taking place and provided negligent advice, and Jagged Globe is liable for the negligence.’

Patrick Limb QC, for Jagged Globe and its owner Simon Lowe, said the company could not be held responsible for injuries Miss Harrison suffered while performing television stunts.

He questioned why Sir Ranulph did not give evidence, saying: ‘If leadership involves responsibility – and it does – Mr Lowe regrets that Sir Ranulph Fiennes was so absent a figure in regard to the trial. I say this openly.’

Last year Miss Harrison won her court case when a judge found Jagged Globe was liable for her injuries, opening the door for a damages payout of up to £30,000.

But yesterday the Appeal Court exonerated the Sheffield-based holiday firm of any responsibility, and ordered Miss Harrison to pay legal costs of £50,000. Lord Justice Pitchford, sitting with Lord Justice Laws and Mr Justice Lloyd-Jones, said: ‘The guides were able, experienced, conscientious and diligent... The execution of stunts formed no part of the package provided by Jagged Globe to Miss Harrison.’

He added: ‘When a person is perfectly well aware of the risk they are taking, the defendant doesn’t owe such a duty.’

Miss Harrison refused to comment as she left court.

Mr Lowe said the five-year legal fight had been ‘a dreadful battle’. He added: ‘The question of why Sir Ranulph didn’t come forward and take responsibility is one for him.’

Sir Ranulph, who lives in Exmoor, Somerset, with his second wife  Louise Millington, was unavailable for comment. His office said he  was ‘away’.

It was not clear if HBO used any footage from the expedition.

• PRESENTER Griff Rhys Jones admitted misleading BBC viewers by falsely claiming to have reached the summit of Ben Nevis in his 2007 series Mountain. He later admitted he was 400ft short of the 4,406ft peak, but blamed thick fog for obscuring his view.

• Survival expert Bear Grylls faked a bear attack on his Born Survivor programme by getting a colleague to dress up. Grylls also apologised for ‘misleading audiences’ in scenes where he was apparently abandoned in the wild, but a source claimed the star actually stayed in a motel.

• A scene in Gordon Ramsay’s series The F Word was faked to make it look as if the celebrity chef had caught several fish at sea. He was filmed during an expedition into coastal waters and returning to the shore with a number of sea bass, but it emerged that an expert caught some beforehand to guarantee Ramsay had something to cook.

• A British TV company was accused of mistranslating quotes from an Amazonian tribe to make them look ‘savage’ and ‘sex-obsessed’ in documentary Mark & Olly: Living with the Machigenga, which aired in the US.
