Going on holiday is usually an exciting time, but flight delays can put a major dampener on travel plans. 

And unlucky travellers flying from Heathrow airport can expect the most disruption this summer.

London's airports are the worst in the UK for flight hold-ups, with Heathrow topping the list in a new study. 

What's the hold up? Passengers waiting for their flights at Heathrow Terminal 3 

A total of 15,591 delays were recorded at Heathrow airport, with the longest lasting 23hrs 26mins

More than a quarter (27 per cent) of flights left the capital's major hub Heathrow more than 15 minutes late - adding up to 15,591 delays.

Gatwick airport came in second with 8,912 (26 per cent) flights delayed. 

Luton had 1,934 (21 per cent) late departures and Stansted 2,967 (19 per cent) tardy flights, leaving thousands of passengers inconvenienced.

The longest delay was at Manchester with a waiting time just shy of an entire day (23hrs 57mins).

But Heathrow and Gatwick were not far behind with of 23hrs 26mins and 21hrs 23mins respectively.

The figures were revealed by specialist solicitors Bott & Co. which analysed flights between UK airports and 18 of Britain's most popular summer holiday destinations including Cyprus, Egypt, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Spain – including the Balearics and Canaries – and Turkey.

It found flights to Larnaca in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up with 12 per cent of summer flights there delayed.

Second was Majorca's Palma airport, which saw 639 tardy flights – the late-running planes representing 10 per cent of the 5,866 flights to the island,

Just a single flight from Blackpool airport was delayed – 0.2 per cent of its 634 flights. 

And Robin Hood airport also proved its punctuality with just 1 per cent of its 666 flights leaving more than 15 minutes after the scheduled departure time.

Playing the waiting game: Some travellers had to wait almost an entire day before jetting off on holiday

One to avoid? Flights to Larnaca airport in Cyprus had the highest chance of being held up

All three Turkish airports on the list fell outside the top ten: Antalya came 12th with 4 per cent of UK flights there delayed; Bodrum was 13th with 3.9 per cent of flights and Dalaman 15th with 3.4 per cent of flights.

Heraklion airport in Greece is the least likely to keep you waiting, with just 2 per cent of the 886 flights there delayed.

The shortest maximum recorded delay was at Robin Hood (1hr 34mins); Glasgow Prestwick (2hrs 58mins); and Norwich (3hrs 33mins).

Heading home, Larnaca saw the longest hold-up of 24hrs 35mins. Tenerife was not far behind with 21hrs 3mins.

Delayed passengers travelling in Europe can now claim up to up to Euro 600 per person for delays over three hours – depending on the delay length and flight distance.

But delays caused by 'extraordinary circumstances' such as terrorism, sabotage, extreme weather conditions or industrial strikes are not eligible.
