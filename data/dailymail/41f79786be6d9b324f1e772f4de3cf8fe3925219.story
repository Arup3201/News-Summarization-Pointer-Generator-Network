The 12-year-old boy who allegedly stabbed a 9-year-old playmate to death on a Michigan playground has been identified as Jamarion Lawhorn.

Police say that after he stabbed Michael 'Conner' Verkerke in a Kentwood, Michigan, trailer park on Monday night, Jamarion called 911 and confessed - telling police dispatchers 'Hi. I just stabbed somebody. Please pick me up.'

The Grand Rapids Press reports that Jamarion sobbed and trembled as he appeared in court on Tuesday to face murder charges. Even the prosecutor, who has opted to try him in juvenile court as an adult, remarked that he looked 'tiny' and younger than his age. 

His mother appeared in court with him and wiped away his tears and rubbed his back to comfort him, according to the newspaper. 

Shocking: Jamarion Lawhorn, 12, is charged with murder. He will be tried as an adult in juvenile court. Even prosecutors said he looked small and young for his age

Horrific: Michael 'Conner' Verkerke died Monday night after being stabbed in the back multiple times and he and friends played on a playground near his home

Police Jamarion didn't know Conner before the attack. They say the two boys had been playing together when Jamarion pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back

Jamarion's lawyer entered a 'not guilty' plea and asked that the boy undergo a psychological examination to determine if he is fit to stand trial. 

The 12-year-old did, however, tell a judge that he understood the charges against him.

Under Michigan law, Jamarion could be given a 'blended' sentence if he is convicted, which would keep him in a juvenile detention facility until he is 21. After that, a judge would determine whether he should be released or sent to adult prison. 

Police say that Jamarion's attack on Conner was unprovoked and inexplicable. He didn't know Conner before the attack and had joined the 9-year-old and two friends on the playground. 

Suddenly, he pulled a knife out of the sand and stabbed Conner multiple times in the back, authorities say. Police aren't saying where Jamarion got the weapon. 

Conner ran to his home house nearby and collapsed on the porch. He was taken to the hospital in critical condition an died hours later. 

 Authorities say Jamarion is the youngest child ever charged with murder in Kent County - and one of the youngest in the state of Michigan. An 11-year-old boy was convicted of killing his mother's boyfriend in 1997 in Pontiac, Michigan. 

Horrific: A 9-year-old boy died at the hospital after being attacked on the playground by a 12-year-old, police say. He was stabbed at least once in the back with a kitchen knife

Random: Police say the 12-year-old didn't know the young boy he attacked and he didn't live in the trailer park near the playground

Witness Glen Stacy told the Press he was doing yard work when Jamarion approached him and asked to borrow his cell phone. Mr Stacy said he assumed the child was calling him mother. Instead the 12-year-old called cops and admitted to a brutal crime.

Mr Stacy says the boy told police: 'I want to die. I don’t want to be on this earth anymore. Please pick me up.' 

He says Jamarion told him that he lashed out because he had 'taken many pills' and nobody loved him.

The 12-year-old was eerily calm and patiently waited for police, Mr Stacy told the Press.

Witness: Glen Stacy says the 12-year-old suspect asked to borrow his cell phone then called 911 and admitted he had killed 

He only became animated when police finally arrived - and didn't immediately arrest him. Mr Stacy said the first emergency personnel went to the playground to help the victim. This upset the boy.

'Hello. I’m right here. You’re going the wrong way,' Jamarion shouted as officers arrived.

When police did finally come for him, he walked toward the cops with his hands out in front of him - showing he wanted to be handcuffed.
