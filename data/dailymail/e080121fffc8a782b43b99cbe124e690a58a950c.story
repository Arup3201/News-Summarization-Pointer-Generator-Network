The wife of the U.S. soldier accused of killing 17 Afghan villagers has defended her husband in an interview with NBC's Today show, saying she finds the charges ‘unbelievable' while vowing to stand by him.

Karilyn Bales told Matt Lauer this morning that her husband, Staff Sargent Robert Bales, is 'very brave, very courageous'.

The Washington state woman said her husband joined the Army after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, to 'protect his family, friends and country. He wanted to do his part'.

She told Matt Lauer: 'I have no idea what happened, but he would not ... he loves children, and he would not do that'

Officials say Staff Sargent Bales 
wandered off base in southern Afghanistan earlier this month and killed 
eight Afghan adults and nine children.

The wife of the Joint Base Lewis-McChord soldier said the accusations are 'unbelievable to me'.

She
said her husband had no nightmares or any other signs of PTSD, and says
she didn't ask him about the accusations when she spoke to him on the 
phone.

'He seemed a 
bit confused as to where he was or why he was there,' she said. 'I don't
think I'll have to ask him. I think he'll tell me.'

When asked what kind of a dad her husband is to their two children -
a girl named Quincy, four, and a boy named Bobby, three - she said: 
'He's a very involved father. He loves children, he's like a big kid 
himself.'

‘I have no idea what happened, but he would not ... he loves children, and he would not do that.’

She
said she was in the grocery store when she heard the news and prayed it
wasn't her husband. She soon received a call from officials who broke 
the news.

'They held my hand and just said that…they thought that he had left the base and perhaps killed the Afghan civilian,' she said. 'That was the only sentence and I just started crying. I just don't think he was involved.'

When asked if she would change her mind if an official came forward and said: 'Yes he turned himself in, he did this', she replied: 'I don't think anything will change my mind in believing he did not do this, this is not what it appears to be.'

He was formally charged on Friday with 17 counts of premeditated murder and six counts each of 
attempted murder and assault. He could face the death penalty if convicted.

According to Afghan officials, the 17th fatality was the unborn child of one of the victims.

The U.S. paid $50,000 in compensation for each villager killed and $11,000 for each person wounded in a shooting rampage allegedly carried out by a rogue American soldier in southern Afghanistan, Afghan officials said yesterday.

The families were told that the money came from President Barack Obama. The unusually large payouts were the latest move by the White House to mend relations with the Afghan people after the killings threatened to shatter already tense relations.

These were further heightened today after a gunman in an Afghan army uniform shot dead two British troops inside a base in southern Afghanistan.

The attack in Lashkar Gar appeared to be the latest in a string of 'green on blue' attacks in which Afghan security forces have turned on their international colleagues or mentors.

A NATO source confirmed the victims were British.

U.S. investigators have said they believe Bales killed in two episodes, returning to his base after the first attack and later slipping away to kill again. He is reported to have surrendered without a struggle.

The 38-year-old married father-of-two from Lake Tapps, Washington, is being held at a U.S. military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Karilyn Bales, also 38, has spoken to her husband by telephone twice since he was detained.

The soldier called his wife first from overseas shortly after massacre, and then last week from Fort Leavenworth where the two talked about family matters and 'reaffirmed their love for each other,’ said her attorney, Lance Rosen.

She once worked for Washington Mutual, the giant Seattle-based mortgage lender, according to her LinkedIn.com profile.

She is now working for Amaxra, a business communications company in Redmond, Washington, as an associate technical project manager.

Bales was on his fourth tour of duty in a war zone, having served three tours in Iraq, where he suffered a head injury and a foot injury.

His civilian attorney, John Henry Browne, had said the soldier and his family had thought he was done fighting.

The family has set up a defence fund to help pay for Bales' legal fees.

The Bales family had a Seattle-area home condemned, struggled to make payments on another and failed to get a promotion a year ago. Karilyn Bales put the family's Tacoma-area home up for sale days before the rampage.

The youngest of five brothers, Bales grew up in the working class Cincinnati suburb of Norwood, Ohio, and has been described as cheerful, all around good guy.

He joined the Army two months after 9/11, after a Florida investment business failed and after he had worked with a string of securities operations.
