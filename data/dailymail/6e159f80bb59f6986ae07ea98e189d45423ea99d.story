Boys really are more competitive than girls... but only if they come from rich families, say researchers.

A study of 15-year-olds found there was a gender gap in the risks they were prepared to take to make more money in a series of maths tests.

The Norwegian youngsters were able to earn one krone if they answered a simple question correctly or threeÂ  kroner if they gambled on the harder option.

Boys are from Mars... The study found that among well-off participants, boys were much more aggressive than girls. Professor Bertil Tungodden said that both biology and culture impact the results

Of the boys, 51 per cent chose the competitive alternative, compared with 31 per cent of the girls.

But when the researchers, from the Norwegian School of Economics in Bergen, asked participants about their family circumstances, it became clear class was an important factor.

The scientists found that boys from poor families were on the same level as girls from a similar background. But among the well-off participants boys were much more aggressive.

Professor Bertil Tungodden, of the Norwegian School of Economics, 
Bergen, believes if biology is the decisive factor it has consequences 
for politics.

He said: 'Our point is if the difference in 
competitiveness is a result of women being discriminated or oppressed it
 lends legitimacy to politics which aims to balance this difference.

'However,
 if our finds primarily reflect basic biological differences the 
challenge becomes how to relate to this.

'Of course it is never only the 
one or the other. We believe both culture and biology are at play here.'

A similar American study from 2007 found 73 per cent of the men were competitive, against just 35 per cent of the women.

Cultural impact: According to Professor Tungodden the studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders

Earlier research among the Maasai tribe in Tanzania, a very patriarchal group, found the men were most competitive whereas women wear the trousers in the matriarchal Khasi people of India.

They were even slightly more competitive than the Maasai men.

Prof Tungodden said: 'Based on these finds it has been argued competitiveness is culturally determined.

'While it is one thing to look at cultures which are extreme in terms of gender differences, what may be found in the most gender equal society in the world?

'If measures towards gender equality works in regard to competitiveness the gender differences ought to be smaller in countries such as Norway.'

But that is not the case. According to Prof Tungodden there are dramatic gender differences among the top executives in Norway, with just ten to fifteen per cent women.

He said: 'The studies indicate a lack of competitiveness may be a reason why women do not become top leaders.

'This does not necessarily mean they ought to compete more. Perhaps we need to think differently about the way we recruit top leaders. The most competitive candidate is not necessarily the best leader.'
