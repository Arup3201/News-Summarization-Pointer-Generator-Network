Pictures from more than 60 years of the Miss World competition show how much fashion and beauty has changed since the first show in 1951.

The finalists in this year's pageant gathered for a photocall in London this morning to vie for the 2014 crown of Miss World.

But while contestants are often accused of being identikit models, these pictures show the difference between the first winners with their demure post-war glamour and the glitzy gowns of contestants in more recent years.

The 1950s lady traditionally showed much less flesh than your average 21st century woman.

But even in the first Miss World, the contestants had to show off their figures in the swimwear round. 

In fact, the event was first organised in 1951 as an all-singing, all-dancing advert for beachwear called The Festival Bikini Contest, but the press referred to it as Miss World and the name stuck. 

The competition winner - Kiki Hakansson from Sweden - was crowned in a bikini at the Lyceum Theatre in London. 

Several countries with strong religious links threatened to pull out of the pageant in protest and the swimwear round was scrapped for several years. 

It means that Kiki is the only winner to have ever been crowned while wearing a bikini.

Since then, the contest has since been staged all over the world. 

The trends have ranged from the big eyes and winged eyeliner of the 60s, to the giant hair and shoulder pads of the 80s.

In the 90s, the winners' outfits morphed into the glitter-heavy gowns that the competition is now famous for, while contestants from the noughties are notable for their slim frames and lack of first winner Kiki’s hour-glass figure.

The competition has seen some famous names pass through over the years.

Since the pageant started, women from Britain have claimed the the crown four times, by Rosemarie Frankland in 1961, Ann Sydney in 1964, Lesley Langley in 1965 and Sarah-Jane Hutt in 1983.

Brit Helen Morgan was named Miss World 1974 but ‘dethroned’ four days later after it was discovered she had a son.

The contestants for this year's Miss World have now arrived in London, where the 2014 pageant is taking place on December 14. 

125 women from all over the world are taking part in the contest. 

The contestants have to survive elimination rounds in beach fashion, ‘Beauty With A Purpose’ presentations, sports and talent among others.
