Built entirely from recycled shipping containers, London's latest retail park is not your average shopping experience.

Boxpark opened in east London today and claims to be the world's first ever 'pop-up' shopping centre.

Located on trendy Shoreditch High Street, it is made up of 60 standard-sized shipping containers which are stacked two stories high and five rows wide.

But despite its bizarre set-up, the new shopping centre is already proving popular with celebrities and the public alike.

Rapper Dizzee Rascal was spotted buying trendy caps and jeans at the east London site today.

British entrepreneur Roger Wade - who made his name in the 1990s through the fashion label Boxfresh - is behind the park.

Speaking to CNN, he said: 'These containers have a strong symbolism for me.

'When I first started out selling clothes on a market stall, I dreamed of the day I'd be shipping my wares off to Hong Kong inside one of these.

'Now I think it's fitting that something so closely associated with global trade has ended up itself as a shop.'

As well as being highly original and laying claim to be a world first, Mr Wade also believes Boxpark it is the most environmentally friendly shopping centre ever built.

It took a year to complete and has a temporary lease of five years.

'The great thing is, if one of these shops doesn't feel it's getting the most out of this location, they can potentially move to another part of the country with a vacant bit of land,without having to close down or dismantle a thing,' Wade told CNN.

Once the five-year lease is up, the plan is to return the land back to its owners in the same condition as it was before Boxpark was built.

It is then hoped that the community can decide if it wants a more permanent retail space there.
