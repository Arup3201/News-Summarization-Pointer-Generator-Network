Perhaps buoyed by the news of the upcoming royal birth, Princess Eugenie looked in excellent spirits as she watched the tennis.

A known tennis enthusiast, Princess Eugenie of York attended the 2014 US Open Men's Final at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center  in New York City yesterday to watch the hotly anticipated game between Marin Cilic and Kei Nishikori.

The 24-year-old royal was spotted quaffing champagne with New York entrepreneur Phil Winser and they talked and giggled throughout the match before heading into the exclusive Moet & Chandon Suite.

The young royal looks to have made a firm friend in entrepreneur Phil Winser

Eugenie wore a chiffon panel dress with a bold black and white design on the lower two thirds, and looked happy as she chatted animatedly with 29-year-old Phil throughout the game 

The Princess's obviously familiarity with Phil will undoubtedly raise a few eyebrows, with her long term boyfriend thousands of miles away in London.

While older sister Beatrice has been loved up with long term boyfriend David Clark for years, Eugenie’s love life has remained much more clandestine.

Although she has been linked to Jack Brooksbank for the past four years, the pair have always been intensely private about the status of their romance and it is not known how the pair are handling their trans-Atlantic relationship.

The pair were last seen together when Eugenie made a brief visit back to the UK and the couple attended Tracey Emin's birthday party in London on July 3.

Eugenie has been living in New York since the summer of 2013, working at Paddle8,an online auction house.

After the match continued the frivolities, posing for pictures with Hollywood actors Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Peter Sarsgaard, and no doubt enjoying more of the host company’s luxury tipple with her friend.

Phil Winser founded the Silkstone Group, a leading New York creative events agency with business partner Ben Towill, before the pair opened three high end restaurants in the city 

The 29-year-old even appeared in Forbes ’30 under 30’ 2014 list, and his success certainly seems to have bought the dashing New Yorker a ticket to the highest echelons of society.

The Queen’s granddaughter wore a chiffon panel dress with a bold black and white design on the lower two thirds to the match yesterday.

Cinched in with a belt, Eugenie threw on a chic tailored blazer for the party in the Moet suite, keeping her hair and make-up simple.

Phil, who a leading New York creative events agency, enjoyed the free champagne in the exclusive Moet & Chandon Suite with the princess 

The notoriously private Eugenie, 24, was even happy to pose for a photograph with Phil 

The princess seemed amused by Phil's attempts to tame his rather unconventionally long locks
