When Shana Warner's boyfriend, Jeff, popped the question last week, they didn't want her 6-year-old daughter, Ally, to feel left out.

So, days later, during a trip to see Santa, the 34-year-old Flint, Michigan, man got down on one knee a second time, presenting little Ally with a mini-me engagement ring and asking her 'Will you be my step-daughter?'

Of course she accepted, and a teary Shana captured the adorable moment on camera before posting the pictures to Reddit, where the unique proposal has now gone viral.

Proposal: When Shana Warner's boyfriend, Jeff, right, surprised her with a ring last week, he didn't want the Flint, Michigan mom's 6-year-old daughter, Ally, center, to feel left out

'Mummy got a ring and mummy got proposed to so we just wanted her to feel very included in our family,' Shana, 28, told MailOnline Sunday.

After two-years dating, Jeff, a pediatric physical therapist, asked Shana to marry him in front of all their friends and family at his 34th birthday party last weekend.

'I thought it was just his birthday party and then he got down in front of one knee and proposed. It was really special,' she said.

Since they met, Jeff and Ally have 
become close, and the couple wanted to make sure the little girl, who 
sees her biological father on weekends, felt a part of the celebrations.

Family: So, days later, during a trip to see Santa, the 34-year-old, left, got down on one knee a second time, presenting little Ally, center, with a mini-me engagement ring and asking her 'Will you be my step-daughter?' Shana, right, watched on in tears

Matching: Shana bought Ally's adorable diamond ring, pictured left with her own, a while ago and she and Jeff thought the Christmas village would be a good time to give it to her

Shana, who is a corrections nurse at a local jail, said every year she takes Ally to Bronner's - the biggest Christmas store in the United States - and they pick out an ornament to get engraved with their names.

She and Jeff thought this would be the perfect moment.

So on Saturday they went off to see Santa at the Frankenmuth, Michigan, holiday village and after Ally had told him what she wanted for Christmas, Jeff made his move.

'Santa was about to let her go when Jeff got down on one knee and asked her,' Shana explained. 'She was in awe, she thought it was amazing. At first, she was just really overwhelmed and then finally she said "yes."'

Excited: Ally, pictured, will be a junior bridesmaid in the March 2015 ski slope wedding

Shana, who bought the stunning diamond ring a while ago, said she knew Ally would accept. But she said the little girl felt so honored, she tried to give Jeff some money in return for the piece of jewelry.

'She was so overwhelmed with feelings and that she was given something so precious she tried giving Jeff a dollar,' Shana laughed, adding that Ally was a 'perfect little angel' for the rest of the day.

Later, the mom shared the heartfelt moment online.

Now with the double proposal out the way, the avid skiers are preparing for a March 7, 2015, wedding on the slopes of Crystal Mountain, Michigan.

'We're going to be skiing down the isle,' she told MailOnline.

Of course Ally will be heavily involved in the celebrations, as a junior bridesmaid. But the role she's most looking forward to is that of big sister sometime in the future.
