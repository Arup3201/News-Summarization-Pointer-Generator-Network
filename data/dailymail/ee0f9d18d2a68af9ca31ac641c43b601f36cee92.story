Royal couple: Prince Roy and Princess Joan Bates at Sealand in 2001

A retired army major who built his own nation on a former anti-aircraft tower in the North Sea has died at the age of 91.

Roy Bates moved his family to the Roughs Tower island fort after he was prosecuted under Marine Broadcasting Offences Act for his part in the pirate radio movement - which inspired the Richard Curtis movie The Boat That Rocked.

Major Bates declared the fort independent from the UK and renamed it Sealand on his wife Joan's birthday, September 2, 1967, and bestowed her the title of 'princess'.

Sealand has its own stamps, passports and currency.

The Sealand Dollar has a fixed exchange rate of one U.S. dollar - and an image of Princess Joan on the coin.

The English-speaking country has 
its own red, white and black flag, and a national motto of E Mare 
Libertas, or 'From the Sea, Freedom'.

The fort, with an area of just 550 sq
 metres, was initially built by Britain during the Second World War to 
guard approaches to the Thames Estuary.

Major Bates passed away on Tuesday at a care home in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, after a long battle with Alzheimer's.

His wife Joan is now expected to take over the rule of Sealand.

The nation has a colourful history and has been invaded once - by rival pirate DJs - and even survived a coup attempt by German businessmen.

Before Mr Bates claimed the fort, he set up Radio Essex on the nearby Knock John fortified tower in the North Sea. It was Britain's first 24-hour pirate station but was swiftly closed down by the government.

Following legal advice, Bates bought HM Fort Roughs, another derelict 
  artillery installation, and declared independence from Britain.

But while he had outsmarted the British government, there was still trouble ahead for Mr Bates, not least of which was an attempted invasion by rival pirate DJs from Radio Caroline.

It's a small world: Roy Bates made this platform his own country

When they attempted to take the platform, Mr Bates and his crew fought them off using Molotov cocktails and warning shots.

A year later, when Royal Maritime 
auxiliary vessel Golden Eye passed close by, he fired three warning 
shots across her bow, prompting the ship to turn back. Bates was 
summonsed to appear before a judge in Essex but was ruled to have acted 
outside of British jurisdiction.

In 1978, a German businessman who had been dealing with Mr Bates flew to Sealand and staged a coup while the retired Army major and his family were ashore following an argument over money.

Within days Mr Bates retook Sealand in a dawn raid, having rappelled from a helicopter with his son Michael, armed with a rifle and wearing combat fatigues.

An obituary to Mr Bates on the Sealand website reads: 'Roy was born to be an adventurer' and tributes said he was a 'pioneer'.

Kevin Klerks wrote: 'Prince Roy of Sealand, the government and the People of Sealand.

'He was a pioneer in the 
micronational community, his dedication and commitment to an idea 
inspired hundreds in the boundless pursuit for a better world.

'His passing will be remembered and his legacy honoured.'

And Geoff Mills wrote: 'So sorry for your loss, my thoughts and prayers are with you all at this time. RIP Roy Bates.'

Major Bates was born to Harry and 
Lilyan Bates in 1921 and joined the international brigade at the age of 
15, fighting in the Spanish civil war.

He then served in Africa, Italy, Iraq
 and Syria, in WWII and was once taken prisoner, and suffered horrific 
wounds after a grenade exploded near his face,

After the war his wounds healed and 
he ran various businesses before getting involved with pirate radio and 
then founding Sealand.

Glamorous: The late Roy Bates made his wife Princess Joan of Sealand

In a 1980s television interview, Mr Bates declared: 'I might die young or I might die old, but I will never die of boredom.'

The island, which is seven-and-a-half
 miles off Felixstowe in the North Sea, is not currently officially 
recognised by any sovereign state.

However, the WikiLeaks organisation last week suggested it was considering setting itself up on the island nation.

Sources at the whistle blowing 
organisation announced earlier in the year that they were looking to 
move their computer servers to international waters.

Officials from Sealand then claimed to have been contacted by the activist group to discuss 'business'.

Major Bates is survived by his wife, son Michael and daughter Penny.
