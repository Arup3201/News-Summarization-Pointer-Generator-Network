The spacecraft it is hoped will take man to Mars is about to be tested for the first time.

Nasa’s Orion spacecraft will take its first flight in December.

Today, staff at the agency's Kennedy Space Center in Florida began the final assembly for the test.

The Orion crew module for Exploration Flight Test-1 going through final preparations. In December, Orion will launch 3,600 miles into space in a four-hour flight to test the systems that will be critical for survival in future human missions to deep space.

Orion is being prepared for its first launch later this year, an uncrewed flight that will take it 3,600 miles above Earth, in a 4.5 hour mission to test the systems critical for future human missions to deep space.

After two orbits, Orion will reenter Earth’s atmosphere at almost 20,000 miles per hour before its parachute system deploys to slow the spacecraft for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.

Engineers began stacking the crew module on top of the completed service module, the first step in moving the three primary Orion elements –crew module, service module and launch abort system – into the correct configuration for launch.

'Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,' said Mark Geyer, NASA's Orion Program manager.

'Orion's flight test will provide us with important data that will help us test out systems and further refine the design so we can safely send humans far into the solar system to uncover new scientific discoveries on future missions.'

With the crew module now in place, the engineers will secure it and make the necessary power connections between to the service module over the course of the week.

Once the bolts and fluid connector between the modules are in place, the stacked spacecraft will undergo electrical, avionic and radio frequency tests.

The modules are being put together in the Final Assembly and System Testing (FAST) Cell in the Operations and Checkout Facility at Kennedy.

Here, the integrated modules will be put through their final system tests prior to rolling out of the facility for integration with the United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket that will send it on its mission.

Nasa's Orion spacecraft, illustration shown, is due to complete its first unmanned test flight towards the end of this year. The spacecraft will eventually be able to take four astronauts on missions lasting at least 21 days, although this could be extended with a service module currently being researched and developed by Esa

Orion's flight test also will provide important data for the agency’s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and ocean recovery of Orion.

Engineers at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama, have built an advanced adapter to connect Orion to the Delta IV Heavy rocket that will launch the spacecraft during the December test.

How it compares: The SLS is larger than the Saturn rockets than launched man to the Moon. It will also be more powerful than any rocket in operation today. Russia's super-rocket design has yet to be unveiled. However construction of the first stage of Russia's super-rocket - capable of lifting 80 tonnes - is already underway

The adapter also will be used during future SLS missions. NASA’s Ground Systems Development and Operations Program, based at Kennedy, will recover the Orion crew module with the U.S. Navy after its splashdown in the Pacific Ocean.

Earlier this month Nasa began ramping up excitement for sending humans to Mars, outlining its path to the red planet, and showcasing some of the technologies that will help people get there.

But as revealed in a 286-page National Research Council (NRC) report commissioned by the agency, Nasa has been warned that its efforts will be doomed to fail if it does not change its methods.

The scathing assessment claims that without sufficient funding, a clear goal, or help from nations such as China, Nasa will not be capable of making the next giant leap for mankind.

According to the NRC's report, Pathways to Exploration - Rationales and Approaches for a U.S. Program of Human Space Exploration, the U.S. should abandon its 'flexible approach' to human missions beyond Earth, set Mars as its ultimate goal and open the door to partnerships with other partners including China.

*Note: all three options assume ISS missions have been concluded

Option 1 - A 'giant leap' from moon to Mars

- Return to the moon

- Build a lunar base

- Send humans to the surface of Mars

Option 2 - Least technological risk

- Send humans into lunar orbit

- Visit an asteroid in its own orbit

- Return to the moon's surface

- Explore Martian moons Deimos and Phobos

- Enter orbit around Mars

- Land on the red planet

Option 3 - Nasa's current favoured path

- Robotically capture an asteroid

- Place it in lunar orbit for astronauts to visit

- Travel to the moons of Mars

- Place humans in Martian orbit

- Set foot on Mars

This flexible approach currently involves the construction of a heavy-lift rocket known as the Space Launch System (SLS) and a manned capsule spacecraft called Orion.

Both of these are seen as necessities for future missions beyond low-Earth orbit - but as of yet neither has a solid goal beyond a few test flights leading up to 2021.

The NRC recommends Nasa chooses one of three stepping-stone approaches toward Mars, that build technological know-how through a series of well-defined preliminary missions.

All three options begin with the International Space Station (ISS).

The station is seen as vital in testing not only technologies for long-term 
space travel, but also the psychological and biological strains that will
 be felt by astronauts.

However,
 the report claims Nasa's current plan of operating the ISS into the 
next decade, possibly as far as 2028, alongside assembling the 
technologies to land humans on Mars is not feasible.

Continuing on this path 'is to invite failure, disillusionment, and the loss of the longstanding international perception that human spaceflight is something the United States does best,' said the NRC in its report.

Two of the options then involve sending humans back to the moon, something not favoured by the Obama administration.

'I just have to say pretty bluntly here: We’ve been there before,' Obama said in 2010 when outlining Nasa's space policy for the forthcoming years.

President Obama has repeatedly stated his opposition to returning to the moon (artist's illustration of a cancelled Nasa concept shown), saying we have been there before, and should instead look to do new missions such as sending astronauts to an asteroid and ultimately, of course, exploring the surface of Mars

But these paths would be less technologically daunting, NRC panel 
co-chairman Jonathan Lunine of Cornell University said.

One suggestion is that Nasa could follow the International Space Station program, which currently 
costs the United States about £1.8 billion ($3 billion) a year, with a series of lunar 
sorties - an outpost on the moon and then a mission to Mars, according to the report.

The other moon-based option would follow the space station with human missions to an orbit 
beyond the moon, then to an asteroid in its native orbit, then to the 
lunar surface, the moons of Mars, Martian orbit and then to Mars itself.

This would have the most stops en route to Mars, but poses the least 
technological risk because milestones have to be met along the way, claimed the NRC.

The third path 
includes Nasa's current plan to robotically capture an asteroid, 
redirect it into a high orbit around the moon and send astronauts there 
to explore.

The report suggests that the path should continue with missions to the 
moons of Mars, then on to Martian orbit, and finally to the surface of 
the planet.
