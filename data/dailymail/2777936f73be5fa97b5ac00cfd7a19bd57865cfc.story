This is it - the end. I imagine the scissors, now mere centimetres from my neck, making a sound like the rush of a guillotine blade.

For I am about to lose, if not my head, then the signature style that has defined me for the past 15 years. My shoulder-length, honey-coloured tresses. My pride and joy.

'Stop!' I squeal.

The long and short of it: An initially dubious Petronella now loves her pixie cut

But it is too late. My life in hair flashes before my eyes: how I used to stroke it like a beloved pet when I was 13 and it had finally grown enough for me to tease it into a pinned-up style; how I loved using hot rollers when I was 17 in an attempt to look like American actress Veronica Lake.

So when I eventually look down and see my luscious locks on the floor, I think for one crazy moment something inside me has been murdered. 

'It's better to get it over with quickly,' says Tess Boyle, my brilliant hairdresser from the Jo Hansford salon in Mayfair, London. I've long been visiting Tess for haircuts, and the Duchess of Cornwall and Liz Hurley get their coiffures tended to here, too.

But neither of them have done anything so drastic as to have the Anne Hathaway pixie crop. So what on earth possessed me?

Well, it wasn't fashion, despite the popularity of actress Anne Hathaway's crop, which she had done for her role in the film Les Miserables.

No, my decision was based on crude practicalities.

For a start, my hair makes me late. On a holiday to Jamaica, where the climate is devastating to long, frizzy hair like mine, I struggled with a hairdryer, hot irons and a heap of products to tame it into a semblance of a style every evening.

'Have you never thought of cutting your hair?' asked my travelling companion, who'd just waited an hour for me to turn up for dinner.

Top of the crops: Anne Hathaway's pixie crop has become one of the top ten most copied celebrity hairstyles

I knew she was joking. But before I'd left London, a male friend said: 'I like you best with you hair tied back, like a boy.'

I had been mildly annoyed; now I wondered if he actually had a point.

So when I returned to London, I confessed to a couple of friends that I was thinking of cutting it all off.

They told me to go for it - after four glasses of wine. That's when I broke the first rule of tonsorial decision-making: never text your hairdresser when drunk.

The next morning I find myself, sweating, having a 'consultation' with Tess. 'Right,' she says. 'I was thinking Anne Hathaway. Definitely Anne Hathaway.'

Tess has been cutting my hair for 15 years and has been itching to chop it short for ages. But a pixie crop? 

Firstly, I worry that I'll look more gruesome than gamine. My bone structure is good, but it's not classical like Hathaway's. My nose has a bump in the middle - will such an unforgiving cut accentuate it?

Secondly, I worry I'll lose my sex appeal. Don't men love long, tangled hair that they can use to drag you back to their caves?

In the Middle Ages, English queens, no matter what they really looked like, were automatically endowed by painters and poets with very long, fair hair. The length indicated fertility and the light colour virtue.

I had the length and the colour if not the virtue. So why did I want to lose those as well?

Tess ignores my tortured bleating and says she believes long hair is not the most flattering style for women over 35. She says it pulls down the face, making it appear older. Short hair will 'take years off you'.

Tess doesn't even wash my hair before she begins to chop - apparently that gives people too much time to change their mind when going for something this drastic.

 

'I feel the back of my neck: there is 
nothing there. I recall Ronald Reagan's line in the 1942 film King's 
Row. He finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries: "Where's the rest of me?"'

She turns my chair away from the mirror. 'No peeking till it's ready,' she says, clearly worried I might faint from shock.

Then I am shampooed and my hair combed, parted and cropped with a small blade that brushes the back of my neck.

I feel the back of my neck: there is nothing there. I recall Ronald Reagan's line in the 1942 film King's Row. He finds out both his legs have been amputated and duly cries: 'Where's the rest of me?' 

Tess begins to blowdry what's left of me. It takes three minutes. It used to take me at least 25.

By this time I'm almost sobbing. I realise that such a drastic change in hairstyle will require a whole new way of life.

During the day, I almost never wear make-up because I can hide behind my hair. If my eyes are puffy, I simply shake some tendrils over them. If I get a spot on my forehead, I'll artfully pin my hair to cover it. Now I'll need to wear lots of make-up at all times.

I'll need a new wardrobe, too. With a pixie crop, pared-down elegance is crucial. Think Fifties-style silk Capri pants and fitted tops.

But while I'll save money on all those anti-frizz hair-styling products, my new wardrobe and enhanced make-up collection will cost another £2,000 at least. Oh Lord!

'You can look now,' Tess cries.

I do not recognise the face staring back at me. My nose seems longer and larger. For one awful moment, I think I look like Anne Robinson. On the plus side, my eyes appear bigger and my cheekbones higher.

In fact, I haven't seen my cheekbones for years - they were always hidden by hair. 'Hello cheekbones,' I say feebly trying to seem happier than I am. I go to the bathroom and apply thick black eyeliner in a vain imitation of Audrey Hepburn. When I add a slick of lipstick, I do feel a little better.

While I look nothing like Anne Hathaway, I do look younger by at least five years.

Meanwhile, Tess is ecstatic. 'It's wonderful!' she gushes, 'It really suits you.'

My mother's reaction is surprisingly enthusiastic, too. 'That's nice, darling. I never noticed what a long neck you had before.'

Cute cut: Getting the chop can be nerve-wracking, but ultimately refreshing

Still, I go out food shopping in dark glasses and a cap. No one recognises me, not even the butcher I owe money to.

The following morning I have a coffee appointment with an old male friend. He screams. 'When did you do that?'

The blood in my veins turns cold. 'It's fabulous. It's taken years off you,' he continues.

My spirits begin to rise. Another friend says I look 'fresher'. 

Then I test it on a date with a man I've been seeing for a while.

Nervously, I put on lashings of black eyeliner and flick my hair up at the ends. Even with the agonising about clothes and make-up, it takes me only 15 minutes to get ready. Gone is the need for backcombing, tonging and spraying my hair.

When my date sees me, he hollers: 'Hey, you're on time. What happened?'

I point to my hair.

'Well it was about time you did something with it. Your hair looked like an unmade bed. Now you look sort of cute.'

Cute? I can't help but be thrilled. I haven't been called that since I was 22.

Perhaps my pixie cut isn't so hair-raising after all.

But maintaining it was time-intensive, so she got the lop!
