Jailed: Umar Patek will spend 20 years in prison for his part in the Bali 2002 bombing

The Indonesian militant accused of helping to build a massive car bomb used in the deadly 2002 Bali nightclub attacks has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Known as 'Demolition Man', Umar Patek is a leading member of the Al Qaeda-linked network Jemaah Islamiyah.

He was found guilty by the West Jakarta District Court of violating the country's harsh anti-terror law.

In today's ruling, the five-member judge panel also convicted 45-year-old Patek for his role in Jakarta church attacks on Christmas Eve in 2000.

Those blasts killed a total of 19 people.

Patek is the last main suspect in the October 12, 2002 Bali resort island attacks that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians and seven Americans.

Patek can appeal against the ruling to a higher court.

Last month Patek, given his nickname after the explosions, said sorry to the victims and their families before adding that he felt 'guilty' about the bombings.

He had denied playing a major role in assembling the massive car bomb that, on Saturday, October 12, 2002, went off outside two nightclubs packed with foreign tourists on the busiest night of the week.

But he still said: 'I still feel guilty. From the bottom of my heart, I apologise to the victims and their families. I knew about the plan. I helped mix some of the chemicals use in the explosives.'

A suicide bomber inside one of the clubs had blown himself up, killing many people and forcing others to run outside where the vehicle loaded with the bomb was parked.

Another suicide bomber then blew that up in an attack which eventually killed 88 Australian victims and seven Americans.

After the bombings, Indonesia was thrust onto the front lines in the battle against terrorism.

Plea: An emotional speech by Patek at a previous hearing saw him apologise to the bombing's victims

There have been several attacks targeting Western hotels, restaurants and an embassy since then. But all have been far less deadly, thanks in part, security experts say, to a relentless crackdown on Jemaah Islamiyah that has largely decimated their ranks.

Patek, who was arrested in Pakistan just over a year ago, told the court the Bali bombings were in theory meant to avenge Western policies in the Palestinian territories.

'From my point of view, it was total failure,' the suspect earlier said, adding he saw 'no connection' between the original mission, fighting against the oppression of fellow Muslims, and the target, partying tourists.

'Yes, most of the victims were white, but there were no Israelis,' he said. 'Some were even Indonesian. That's a failure.'

devastating October 12 attacks were carried out

Patek had faced a maximum penalty of death by firing squad.

He insists he did not play a major role in assembling the massive car bomb - saying that job fell to Jemaah Islamiyah bomb-making masterminds, Azahari bin Husin and Dulmatin, both of whom have since been killed in police raids.

'I only played a small role,' he said, acknowledging that he helped mix less than 50 kilograms (110 pounds) of nearly a ton of the chemicals used in the explosives.

Patek escaped the country after the attack and went on a nine-year flight from justice that took him to the Philippines and Pakistan, allegedly in pursuit of more terror opportunities.

Patek was captured in January 2011 in Abbottabad, where U.S. Navy Seals would kill Osama bin Laden just a few months later.

Patek was then one of Asia's most wanted terror suspects, with a $1 million bounty on his head.
