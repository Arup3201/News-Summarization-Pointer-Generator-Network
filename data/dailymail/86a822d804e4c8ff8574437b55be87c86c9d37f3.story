Troy James Knapp was dodging authorities, again.

The fugitive with a fondness for whiskey and a dislike of living near people had been wanted for a string of break-ins for years at cabins in Utah's mountains. With each near miss, each wanted poster and each threatening note left behind for law enforcement, the legend of him only grew.

Knapp survived by holing up inside the cabins, sleeping in the owners' beds, eating their food and listening to their AM radio for updates on the manhunt. And then, authorities say, he would take off, stealing items such as guns and high-end camping equipment and vanishing into the woods where he lived off dandelions and wild game.

Over Easter weekend, authorities were on his trail, again.

By Tuesday, his life on the lam came 
to an end, done in by an educated guess by searchers who had grown to 
know his tendencies, the tracks he left with his snowshoes and the 
sounds of him chopping wood outside a cabin near a mountain reservoir.

A team of 14 officers approached him 
on snowshoes - the only way to quietly sneak up on him - and called in 
reinforcements to help corner the bearded and camouflage-clad fugitive, a
trim 45-year-old standing 5-foot-8.

Now in police custody, Knapp is 
telling authorities how he managed to evade them for so long across a 
mountainous region stretching for 180 miles. "He really has a 
fascinating story to tell, and right now he's willing to tell it," 
Sanpete County Sheriff Brian Nielson said.

Knapp, born in Saginaw, Mich., got 
into trouble with the law early. As a teenager, he was convicted of 
breaking and entering, passing bad checks and unlawful flight from 
authorities, according to court records. His most serious offense, an 
arrest for felony assault in Michigan, was reduced in 1994 to a charge 
of malicious destruction of property after he agreed to plead guilty.

"He says, `I don't hate people. I just don't like living with them,'" Sevier County Sheriff Nathan Sheriff Curtis said.

With no known occupation, Knapp 
drifted across the country and ended up in prison in California for 
burglary. He fell off the radar in 2004 when he "went on the run" while 
on parole, said Bobby Haase, a spokesman for the California Department 
of Corrections and Rehabilitation.

By 2007, Utah authorities began 
investigating a string of cabin burglaries they believed were tied to 
one person. It wasn't until early 2012 that they identified Knapp as the
suspect from cabin surveillance photos and fingerprints lifted from one
cabin. In one photo, he was wearing camouflage, a rifle was slung over 
his shoulder and he had purple-colored aluminum snowshoes on his feet. 
Knapp appears to have aged considerably from a 2001 California mug shot.

Tracy Glover, chief deputy sheriff in 
Kane County, said it was fairly easy to identify Knapp's cabin habits. 
Knapp would drink any coffee and alcohol he could find, authorities say.
Unlike typical burglars, he never took large or expensive appliances 
such as TVs or stereos. He took only what he could carry, mostly camping
gear and weapons he stashed in abundance in the woods. He returned to 
burglarize cabins more than once, even swapping one stolen rifle for 
another, officials said.

A few years ago, investigators found 
an abandoned camp they linked to Knapp. It had a doomsday supply of 
dehydrated foods, radios, batteries, high-end camping gear, 19 guns and a
copy of Jon Krakauer's "Into the Wild," a book about a young man who 
died after wandering into the Alaskan wilderness to live alone off the 
land.

It was in Kane County, near Zion 
National Park, where authorities lifted Knapp's fingerprints from items 
in a cabin. The prints matched sets in criminal databases, giving law 
enforcement confidence that he was their guy.

Knapp is believed to have left that 
area in early 2012. He started to make his way north from Kane into 
Sevier, Sanpete and Emery counties, where he was occasionally spotted by
hunters. Knapp has told detectives he was feeling stressed trying to 
hide from hunters last fall, said Brian Nielson, the sheriff in Sanpete 
County.

Court records from multiple Utah 
counties indicate Knapp regularly spent several days in snowbound 
cabins, exhausting the food and firewood before moving on. Authorities 
say the signature clue of his presence was an empty bottle of whiskey. 
In summer, he retreated to makeshift camps deep in the backcountry.

He sometimes tidied up a cabin, but 
other times left it a mess or riddled with bullets, authorities say. He 
was known to deface religious icons. He scrawled notes for cabin owners,
alternatively thanking them or demanding they "get off my mountain." He
also warned sheriffs he was "gonna put you in the ground!"

Even authorities have found something 
to admire in Knapp's knack for survival and evasion. He stepped on 
saplings to avoid leaving discernible boot tracks and changed stolen 
footwear often to confuse searchers. He walked alongside trails instead 
of on them and kept mostly to backcountry.

He used some of those tactics in his 
final flight, which started more than a dozen miles away from his 
capture site. At Joe's Valley in the Manti-LaSal National Forest, 
deputies found boot prints around two burglarized cabins. The tracks led
in no apparent direction, Emery County sheriff's Cpt. Jeff Thomas said.

Deputies copied his silent mode of 
travel on snowshoes over three days and nights as they tried to track 
Knapp across rugged terrain, first losing his size-10 shoe prints, then 
regaining his tracks on snowshoe as he ventured higher on the 
10,000-foot Wasatch Plateau.

"They stayed quiet and built no fires - and they were very cold," Thomas said.

To get this far, deputies had to think
like Knapp. He moved often and swiftly across the backcountry, covering
20 miles in a day "and that was nothing for him," Curtis said.

They had to imagine where Knapp might 
have taken off. They guessed it was a collection of cabins a dozen miles
away at a high-altitude reservoir. They believe Knapp had visited there
before. Along the way, they picked up his snowshoe tracks.

With 13 cabins at the reservoir, "we 
didn't know exactly where he was," U.S. Forest Service officer Scott 
Watson said. "We couldn't just go knocking on doors."

By 10 a.m. Tuesday, 40 officers took 
positions around the 9,000-foot reservoir. Knapp fired off a handful of 
shots at a helicopter that flushed him out of a cabin. He tried to 
escape into the woods, but ran into three armed officers. He laid down 
his rifle and surrendered.

The last three nights Knapp spent as a
fugitive were in a framed log cabin with a commanding view of forest 
roads leading to Ferron Reservoir. Owner Eugene Bartholomew said "it was
kind of messed up" and "stunk like crazy." It wasn't his only 
discovery. On television news, Bartholomew took his first look at Knapp.

"That son-of-a-bitch has got my coat on," he said.
