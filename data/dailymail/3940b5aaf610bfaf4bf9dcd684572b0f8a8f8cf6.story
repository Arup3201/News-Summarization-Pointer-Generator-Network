It all started as a simple garden fence dispute, but a row between two billionaires on a paradise island has since spiralled to include accusations of arson, racism and high-level corruption.

Now the decade-long feud between New York hedge-fund manager Louis Bacon and Canadian clothing tycoon Peter Nygard is coming to a head once again.

Mr Bacon has just won permission to access to a trove of 1,000 hours of video footage which he claims will show Mr Nygard orchestrated a smear-campaign against him.

The pair are neighbours in the luxury community of Lyford Cray, located on New Providence Island on the Bahamas and have been locked in a decade-long legal dispute over property boundaries

Lawyers for Mr Bacon say the collection includes films with titles such as 'Is Louis Bacon a Racist?' and 'Is Louis Bacon a Murderer?,' according to court papers.

The new accusations are just the latest round of a long-running spat between the pair that has torn the idyllic New Providence Island in the Bahamas apart.

Nygard, a self-styled playboy and eccentric owner of Nygard International, has an estimated fortune just shy of $1billion, and has lived in the exclusive Lyford Cay community on the island since 1987.

His famous 150,000-square-foot beachfront mansion, dubbed 'Nygard Cay', is designed in the style of a Mayan temple, and featured a 32,000-square-foot grand hall with a 100,000lb glass ceiling.

Previous visitors to the complex have included George W Bush and Robert De Niro.

Bacon, meanwhile, is the founder of Moore Capital Management LLC, has an estimated wealth of $1.6billion, and has lived next door to Nygard since 1996.

The feud between the two began around 2004 when a group of conservationists, including Bacon, established the Coalition to Protect Clifton Bay to preserve the Western part of the island, where Nygard lives.

The group accused Nygard of illegally dredging the sea bed, extending the island's natural shore line, and of expanding the borders of his compound without proper permission.

They attempted to block any further attempts by Nygard to expand his home buy buying up a large stretch of coast line and establishing a nature reserve. 

The Canadian hit back with a series of videos in which he claimed to be a friend of the Bahamas and passionate about the conserving the islands.

Nygard has lived on the islands since 1987, and owns a Mayan-themed mansion complex which was partly destroyed by a fire in 2009 - which he accuses Bacon of starting

Nygard founded clothing producer Nygard International and is known as a playboy-eccentric. In the past he has accused Bacon of hiding the fact that his great-grandfather belonged to the KKK

Nygard also accused Bacon of trying to hide the fact that his great-grandfather, Col. Roger B. Moore, was a member of the Ku Klux Klan as well as a former officer in the Confederate Army.

Bacon claims this amounts to character assassination, and says Nygard is behind rallies and protest marches on the island which have seen him denounced as a racist.

The bitter argument came to a dramatic head in 2009 when a fire gutted Nygard's mansion.

Fire crews listed the official cause as 'unknown', but Nygard firmly believes it was an act of arson organised by Bacon - a claim he strongly denies.

Nygard also claimed that Bacon installed four 'large, military-grade' speakers at the boundary between their two properties, before aiming them at his bedroom. 

Bacon then blared 'ear piercing noises' toward Nygard, with one of Bacon's assistants shouting 'There, that's a message from Mr. Bacon. Don't f*** with Louis,' according to court papers.

Since the fire destroyed large parts of his home, Nygard has applied for planning permission to rebuild the lavish estate in even grander style, prompting outrage from the exclusive community.

Earlier this year, more than 100 people, including actor Sean Connery and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, filed a legal complaint against the government over efforts by Mr Nygard to redevelop his compound.

Now a judge has approved access to video tapes which Bacon's legal team say will prove Nygard organised a smear campaign against him. 

Louis Bacon is worth an estimated $1.6billion and is a New York hedge-fund manager and founder of Moore Capital Management LLC. He has accused Nygard of organising protests denouncing him as a racist

In another bizarre allegation, Nygard claims Bacon set up for 'military-grade' speakers along the edge of his property, before aiming them into his bedroom and playing 'ear piercing' noises

Separately this week, Bacon's lawyers also accused Nygard of trying to bribe Bahamian officials into granting planning permission for new developments to his home

The accusations centre around minutes of a meeting with Prime Minister Perry Christie, in which the government appears to agree to $50million-worth of redevelopment, as long as Nygard builds astem-cell research facility on his property, reports the New York Post.

Bacon's legal time argue that minutes of a meeting with Prime Minister Perry Christie - in which the deal was agreed - could be fabricated, or were at least disclosed illegally.

The New York Post reports that Nygard denies trying to influence the government, and likewise denies that he has orchestrated a smear campaign against Bacon.

According to Nygard's lawyer, the billionaire has been supporting  an 'education campaign' mounted by a local group to expose Bacon’s alleged racism.

A spokesman for Nygard added that the latest legal action is another attempt to prevent him from rebuilding his home.
