Nick Clegg was accused of 'riding roughshod' over the views of the religious last night after he was forced to withdraw comments in which he branded opponents of gay marriage 'bigots'.

The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Carey, described the Deputy Prime Minister as 'immature' over remarks he had issued ahead of a reception to mark the end of a consultation on same-sex weddings.

The Liberal Democrat leader was due to describe opponents of the reform as 'bigots', according to a Cabinet Office press release.

He was expected to say: 'Continued 
trouble in the economy gives the bigots a stick to beat us with, as they
 demand we “postpone” the equalities agenda in order to deal with “the 
things people really care about”.

'As if pursuing greater equality and fixing the economy simply cannot happen at once.'

But as the incendiary detail of his 
remarks quickly began to circulate, it prompted a bitter row with MPs on
 the Tory Right who oppose gay marriage, as well as church leaders.

Ninety minutes after issuing the 
offending statement, Mr Clegg's office mounted an extraordinary attempt 
to 'recall' it. Five minutes later, a new version of the speech was 
issued, with the reference to 'bigots' taken out and replaced with 'some
 people'.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg was today forced to withdraw the statement which accused opponents of gay marriage of being 'bigots'

Lord Carey Of Clifton (left), the former Archbishop of Canterbury, said many people would be 'highly offended' by Mr Clegg's remarks while Conservative MP Peter Bone (right) said the Deputy PM should resign

The episode was branded a 'shambles' 
last night and succeeded in angering both opponents of gay marriage, who
 objected to the original remarks, and those in favour of the reform, 
who were dismayed that Mr Clegg had not delivered them.

Lord Carey said: 'There will be many 
Christians and non-Christians who will be highly offended to be called 
bigots. People who oppose same-sex marriages are doing so on the basis 
of deeply-held beliefs and we should not be treated in such a way.

'These are important issues that 
affect society and therefore it is paramount for the Government to give 
serious attention to those who oppose the rush into gay marriage. I'm 
totally for equality – that's not the issue. The issue is should we 
redefine traditional marriage to include same-sex relationships.'

Peter Tatchell, the political and gay rights campaigner in his Elephant and Castle, London, flat.  Mr Tatchell said: 'Homophobic bigotry does still exist in sections of our society, and we should not be afraid to say so.'

Of Mr Clegg's attempt to withdraw the 
remark, Lord Carey added: 'He must have realised that it would offend 
people and it doesn't actually help the discussion. I think it is fairly
 typical of the way that he and some other people in the Coalition have 
tried to ride roughshod over people's deeply held views. This is not the
 way to conduct mature discussions.'

Right-wing Tory MP Peter Bone said Mr 
Clegg should resign. 'This appears to be his real opinion,' he said. 'If
 he is saying people who disagree with him on gay marriage because of 
conscientious or religious grounds are bigots then he should not remain 
Deputy Prime Minister.

'I would never go around accusing 
somebody who disagreed with me of being a bigot, and I don't care if 
it's a Liberal or a Conservative minister who's doing it now – they 
should not remain in post.'

The row had unhappy echoes of the 
so-called 'Bigotgate' furore which engulfed Gordon Brown during the last
 general election. The then prime minister was caught describing 
pensioner Gillian Duffy as a 'bigoted woman' after she confronted him 
over immigration.

Colin Hart, of the Coalition for 
Marriage campaign group, said: 'These intolerant remarks show that there
 is nothing liberal about Nick Clegg.

'It also shows his contempt for the
 millions of ordinary men and women in this country who oppose the 
politically correct drive to rip up the centuries-old definition of 
marriage.

'Perhaps Mr Clegg should stop attacking the British public and 
concentrate on fixing the UK's broken economy, which he was actually 
elected to do.'

But gay rights campaigner Peter 
Tatchell, among the guests at last night's reception in central London, 
said: 'Quite clearly, some people who oppose same-sex marriage do so 
because of personal prejudice and intolerance.

'Homophobic bigotry does 
still exist in sections of our society, and we should not be afraid to 
say so.'

Adrian Trett, chairman of the LGBT 
(lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) Liberal Democrats group, 
another attendee, tweeted ahead of the event: 'Hope Nick does use the 
word "bigot" in his speech as he's absolutely right!'

But Labour MP Thomas Docherty said Mr 
Clegg's media operation was a 'shambles', adding: 'This is a government 
so incompetent they cannot even put together a press release properly.'

A spokesman for Mr Clegg insisted: 
'This was not something the Deputy Prime Minister has said. It's not 
something he was ever going to say because it's not something he 
believes. It was removed from the draft copy, that should never have 
been sent out, for that very reason.'

Mr Clegg revealed last night that the 
Government has received 228,000 responses to the consultation on equal 
marriage, more than any other issue under the Coalition government.

At the reception later, he said: 'I am
 a little bit surprised to see cameras outside the gates for the 
slightly obscure reason that they expect me to use a word about 
opponents of gay marriage that I had no intention of using, would never 
use. It is not the kind of word that I would use.'

A Downing Street source said: 'The 
Prime Minister is committed to this reform and has said we are going to 
do it before 2015.

'There will be MPs on all sides of the House who 
disagree with it, who he does not regard as bigots, who will want to 
vote against. Conservative MPs will have a free vote but we expect it to
 command sufficient support to become law.'
