Admission: Actor Stephen Collins has admitted to inappropriate conduct with young girls in a new confessional essay for People magazine

A woman molested by Stephen Collins when she was just ten has refused to accept his belated apology and insisted he did gain sexual gratification by ejaculating while making her touch him inappropriately.

The shamed actor, who played the righteous dad and pastor on long-running TV show 7th Heaven, recently came out to confirm shocking reports of sexual misconduct with young girls.

The 67-year-old, who was never charged, confessed to inappropriately touching one girl and exposing himself to two others between 1973 and 1994.

The former TV star insisted 'there was no gratification' - calling it an 'impulsive act.. that's haunted him ever since'.

But a woman in her 50s, who cannot be named, claims to be one of Collins' victims and says he is lying, TMZ reports.

She said: 'Stephen is minimizing the incident. It was not just a spontaneous touching ... that aggression resulted in him ejaculating.'

She also slammed his decision not to apologize to her and another girl he targeted, adding: 'His assertion that he wanted to avoid reopening an old wound seems nonsensical to me.' 

The woman refuses to believe there were just three victims - as Collins stated in a taped confession leaked to TMZ by his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant during their bitter divorce proceedings.

She has filed a police report with the NYPD and an investigation is underway - although it's believed any case would be rejected because of the statute of limitations.

The woman adds: 'Why isn't he donating any disposable income, beyond what he needs to survive, to a child-abuse charity. Maybe he should at least try apologizing to his victims.' 

Collins admitted to three incidents in a lengthy confessional essay for People magazine, saying he inappropriately touched one girl and exposed himself to two others between 1973 and 1994, and that his actions were 'inexcusable' and have 'haunted' him ever since.

While none of his victims have ever publicly come forward, and the 67-year-old never charged, reports of his misbehavior surfaced in October when his soon-to-be ex-wife Faye Grant released a taped confession which was obtained by TMZ in the midst of their bitter divorce. 

In the public backlash to the TMZ tapes, Collins lost parts on TV show Scandal and in the sequel to the movie Ted, while re-runs of 7th Heaven were pulled from the air. 

'Forty years ago, I did something terribly wrong that I deeply regret. I have been working to atone for it ever since,' Collins wrote in People. 

Family values: 7th Heaven was a show about a pastor and his wife, raising their large brood of seven children. A young Jessica Biel (to Collins' right in a blue sweater) played the couple's oldest daughter. Collins says he never behaved inappropriately toward any of the young actresses on the show's set 

He says he's decided to speak publicly about the reports because he believes some of his actions have been elaborated. 

'On the recording, I described events that took place 20, 32, and 40 years ago,' Collins adds. 'The publication of the recording has resulted in assumptions and innuendos about what I did that go far beyond what actually occurred. As difficult as this is, I want people to know the truth.' 

He says the only time he touched a girl inappropriately was in 1973, when he was 25 and a pre-teen girl came to stay with him and his first wife. 

Collins says he exposed himself to the girl twice before, but took things to another level on the visit. 

'When the girl and I were watching TV alone, I moved her hand in such a way that caused her to touch me inappropriately. It lasted less than a minute, during which there was no gratification,' Collins said. 'I then left the room. I had no further physical contact with her. It was a completely impulsive act and it's haunted me ever since to think of what I put her through.'

Over the next two decades, Collins says he continued to expose himself to two more teenage girls, once in 1982 and again in 1994.

Interview: Collins of 7th Heaven fame will appear on 20/20 in an interview with Katie Couric in which he confesses to his sex crimes but says he's a changed man who hasn't touched an underage girl since 1994

'The first instance lasted second and the second about a minute,' Collins says of the indecent exposure. 'I had no physical contact of any kind with either girl. I don't say this to excuse what I did - it was inexcusable - but to clarify what actually happened.' 

Collins says the exposure in 1994 was his 'rock bottom' and what caused him to finally seek help for his deviant behavior.

For the past 20 years, Collins says he's been undergoing therapy and religious counseling, while praying and meditating every day.

These treatments, Collins claims, have worked and kept him from harming other young girls.

'Since that day in 1994, I have not had an impulse to act out in any such way.'

Collins has only apologized directly to one of his victims, who he says was 'extraordinary gracious', but has not reached out to the others for fear that he will be 'opening old wounds'.

The actor also describes how the recorded confession came to be. He says he and his wife Grant were undergoing marriage therapy sessions in hopes of healing their relationship.

The second follow-up session is when Collins says he and the therapist were taped by his wife without either of their knowledge.

The couple of nearly 30 years filed for divorce in 2012 but have been engaged in a heated legal battle over how to split their assets.

Grant, who is also an actress, is fighting for high spousal support payments of $13,000 a month, saying she is no longer able to make a living from her career when she took a break to raise their daughter.

She also says she only released the taped confession to police, when Collins allegedly denied to seek treatment for his issues. She denies ever turning the audio over to TMZ.

Collins says the release of the tapes in October led to confusion over when he exposed himself to the young girls, and if it was possible one of his young co-stars on 7th Heaven was a victim.

'I appeared for eleven seasons on a television series with a cast that included minor females in our TV family, and countless other young actresses throughout the show's eleven years. I never behaved inappropriately on or off that set - or on any set I've ever worked on.'

When the tapes were first released, law enforcement in New York and Los Angeles said they were investigating the claims.

But law enforcement sources who spoke with TMZ said that despite the taped confession, they felt Collins would not be charged and 'the cases will go nowhere'.

The LAPD confirmed to MailOnline on Wednesday that they never reopened a case into Collins, and had simply been reviewing the recording in October. 

Calls and emails to the NYPD were not immediately returned Wednesday.

Collins says he planned to release a statement after his divorce was finalized, but decided to come forward earlier when the trial was postponed.

He says he owed family, friends and the public an explanation.

'I want to reassure them about who I am, and I want them to understand that I take these issues very seriously,' he said.

Collins is due to speak about the essay with Katie Couric on Friday.
