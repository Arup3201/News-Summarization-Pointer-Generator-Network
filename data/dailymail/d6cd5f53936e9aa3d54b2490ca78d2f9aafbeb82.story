It is home to landmarks such as Buckingham Palace, St Paul’s Cathedral and Hampstead Heath - but London has been named the worst place to live in Britain.

The capital was labelled the UK’s most hated area in a book identifying the country’s 50 least desirable locations, entitled ‘Crap Towns Returns’.

David Cameron’s hometown of Chipping Norton, where the average house price is £229,000, was dubbed third worst, being described as the home to ‘rank corruption, lurking evil and spouting on about cheese.’

'Worst place to live': London has been labelled the UK's most hated area in a book identifying the country's 50 least desirable locations

The Cotswolds town, whose residents include Rebekah Brooks and Jeremy Clarkson, was blasted as being the ‘spiritual home of the malaise gripping the UK.’

A contributor said: ‘If there are other crap towns in the country, a good deal of the blame must lie with Chipping Norton. It is the cause and karmic repository for their faults too.’

2. Bradford

3. Chipping Norton

4. Southampton

5. York

6. Gibraltar

7. Coventry

8. Nuneaton

9. High Wycombe

10. Stoke-on-Trent

Bradford, Southampton and York were also slated, with Bradford being described as ‘a city with a giant hole in its heart – literally and metaphorically’.

Authors Sam Jordison and Dan Kieran took online contributions from British people who nominated the worst places to live based on factors such as poverty, snobbery and transport links.

Croydon, and Tottenham were highlighted for their ‘violence, malaise and despair’, and Mayfair and the City were described as ‘rubbish’ and full of ‘self-important’ people.

The book, a self-styled ‘genuine rough guide’ to the UK, states: ‘London claims to be a world city – a modern, 24-hour metropolis – but this is mostly just a pretence put on for visitors.

‘Spend an extended time in the place and you’ll realise that it doesn’t stand up.’

The capital was criticised for its costs, queues, binge drinking and lack of community spirit, among other things.

Co-author Sam Jordison said: ‘Nominations can be based on anything and everything. It’s a strength of the book that it’s really hard to define what makes something crap.’

He added: ‘London’s got it from two directions. Lots of Londoners are fed up of the city because of queuing, rocketing house prices, the chore of commuting, the dangers and pure exhaustion of living there.

‘But in contrast there is a lot of snobbery there too, which makes London hated. Contributors complained about gold iPad cases on sale in Mayfair, and about the fact that Londoners have no idea what’s going on elsewhere in the UK.’

Bradford, Chipping Norton, Southampton and York were also slated and made the top five, with Bradford being described as ‘a city with a giant hole in its heart – literally and metaphorically’.

A spokesman said: ‘The reasons behind the nominations for the towns include everything from grinding poverty to unbearable snobbery, but are united by the common feeling that these attributes have a very real impact on quality of life – and enjoyment of life.

‘The survey is proudly unscientific, and based on emotion, as much as all the usual crime statistics, house prices, local facilities, transport and schools.’

The book’s predecessor, Crap Towns, named Hull as Britain’s least desirable area in 2003, but the town was listed as ‘not so crap’ in the latest edition.

Other towns which won praise for having improved since 2003 were Bedford, Liverpool, Morecambe and Hackney.
