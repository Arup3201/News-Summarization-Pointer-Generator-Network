A man who had a vasectomy long before meeting his second wife has revealed the devastating consequences his inability to have children had on his marriage.

In a desperate bid to have a baby, his wife sought a sperm donor from 'unofficial channels' and ended up having an affair.

She eventually conceived twice this way but her infidelity led to her having an abortion and then becoming a single parent.

Marriage breakdown: Peter anonymously shared his story on today's This Morning

Her ex-husband appeared on today's This Morning to share his story but did not real his true identity and all names were changed.

Peter recalled how he met his second wife, Rebecca, who was 'significantly younger' than him in 2004 when he was a divorcee in his sixties with a grown-up son.

After his first divorce, he decided he did not want to have any more children and had a vasectomy.

Rebecca was aware of the situation when they met and fell in love and said it wasn't an issue.

They married in 2008 and then the situation changed. Rebecca, now in her mid-thirties, decided she did want to become a mother after all.

'It's very hard when you can't supply your wife with 
the one thing she really wants'

Peter explained to This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby: 'Her biological clock was ticking and 
things changed, we were in love and in stable relationship it was the 
natural next step.

'It's very hard when you can't supply your wife with 
the one thing she really wants. It's a very hard thing to come to terms 
with.'

Peter said he looked into having his vasectomy reversed but was told there was 'no chance' because it had been carried out too long ago.

The couple then discussed using a sperm donor but dismissed doing this via official channels.

Peter explained: 'The problem with going through official channels is you have no 
idea who the father will be and have no connection with them. Rebecca 
wanted a junior version of myself.'

Peter thought this meant the conversation was over so he was 'taken aback' in 2010 when Rebecca revealed she had found 'someone like me' after researching unregulated donor websites and had set up a meeting.

'I thought the 
conversation was dead. I didn't know she was pursuing other avenues to get a 
donor,' he said. 'She said she had been looking into it and had found someone. They had arranged to meet seven days later.'

He added: 'We both took it for granted it would be artificial insemination, sex was never implied or spoken about.'

Betrayed: He said he didn't know his wife's relationship with the sperm donor had become sexual

Peter agreed to escort Rebecca to met the donor, called Rhys, and took an instant dislike to him.

'I didn't like Rhys, it was his whole demeanor, he kept us waiting at the designated meeting place and then hardly acknowledged Rebecca,' he said.

Peter said at no point did he consent to the pair having natural sex. After this meeting Rhys donated sperm for artificial insemination to Rebecca.

But Peter said: 'That was the only time artificial insemination took place, the rest of the time it was sex.'

Rebecca began visiting Rhys once a month when she was ovulating. Inevitably the situation began to have a detrimental effect on her marriage. Peter said he began to suspect her relationship with Rhys had become sexual but didn't find out for sure until they had a "blazing row".

'I was shocked but wasn't completely 
surprised when she told me she was pregnant again, I had a strong 
feeling she was still seeing Rhys'

He recalled: 'I shouted at her, "you might as well be having sex with him!" and she said "we are!"'

When Rebecca then fell pregnant, Peter demanded she have an abortion or he would leave her.

He admitted: 'She had the abortion which I regret, it was a terrible thing to ask woman to do but I wasn't thinking straight at the time.'

After the abortion, Rebecca and Peter's relationship became beyond repair and he admitted they were living under the same roof but "not living as a married couple".

Unbeknown to him, Rebecca resumed her affair with Rhys and fell pregnant again.

By now, Peter said Rebecca was in love with Rhys and intended to divorce Peter and raise her child with him.

He said: 'I was shocked but wasn't completely surprised when she told me she was pregnant again, I had a strong feeling she was still seeing Rhys.'

But after Peter and Rebecca split up, Rhys wasn't interested in raising the child with her as she had hoped.

Peter had a vasectomy years ago before meeting his second wife who was 30 years his junior

Instead, he claimed no responsibility as the father under the Human Fertilisation Embryology Act of 2008. He denied having a sexual relationship with Rebecca and said she had only ever received his sperm via artificial insemination.

Rebecca launched legal proceedings taking her case to London’s High Court Family Division last July.

Peter said: 'It was bought out through evidence that they had been having sex relationship for a number of months and he could not deny it in court under cross reference.'

'Motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price'

It also transpired during the court proceedings that Rhys was a prolific sperm donor who had sired up to 30 children. He was registered on three different websites and had even advertised his services at 'male-dominated breeding orgies'.

The judge on the case said Rhys had committed "calculating betrayal and abashed dishonesty" and had "concealed his overall activities from recipients he entered into relationships".

But he added that Rebecca had also been "untruthful, devious and manipulative."

Single mother: Rebecca aborted her first child with Rhys then kept the second - but he denied to take responsibility as the father (posed by model)

The judge ruled that the baby had been conceived during a sexual relationship and as a result, Rhys was "not only his biological father but also his legal parent."

Peter is now trying to get on with his life as a single man again after all the hurt and betrayal.

Rebecca said in a statement read on This Morning: 'Motherhood for me has come at an extremely high price. I 
have an adorable child who is my entire life however that has not compensated for the devastating and highly distressing events that 
unfolded and will undoubtedly stay with me for a lifetime.'

Meanwhile, Rhys added in a statement that he sees himself as the victim. He said: 'The husband was fully aware of his wife's 
quest to conceive a child at no point did he intervene to say he did not
 wish to go ahead, had he done so at any point we would not be in the 
position we are now. The process has been destructive to me emotionally, personally and financially.'
