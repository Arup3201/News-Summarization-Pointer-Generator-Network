Jermain Defoe is set to open negotiations with Toronto FC in an attempt to quit the club before the January transfer window.

The former England striker is keen to leave Major League Soccer as soon as possible after seeing deadline day moves to Queens Park Rangers and Leicester City fall through.

And the ex-Tottenham man is exploring the options available to him as he looks to release himself from his Toronto contract.

Wantaway: Jermain Defoe is to open negotiations with Toronto FC in order to end his contract early 

On the move: Defoe was keen to join QPR and could sign in January, or before, if he gets his wish

Defoe, 31, is just six months into a four-year, £90,000-per-week deal, with the Canadian side. 

But he wants to return to England and is keen not to wait for the January transfer window.

Toronto, however, are in a strong position given Defoe still has three-and-a-half years left to run on his deal, something which is likely to complicate the striker's exit strategy.

The MLS club paid £6million to sign the striker from Spurs and would prefer to wait until January to sell him in an attempt to recoup the transfer fee.

Brief stay: Defoe has been with Toronto for less than a year but he could be on the move again
