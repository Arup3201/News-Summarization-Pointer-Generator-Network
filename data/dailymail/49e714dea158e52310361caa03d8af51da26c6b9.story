Prince Philip isn’t one for suffering fools gladly.

Perhaps that attracted him to this book on Attila The Hun as he kept himself amused on a train journey with the Queen yesterday.

The 91-year-old was seen clutching his unusual choice of holiday reading as he and the Queen sat with fellow first class passengers on their way to start their Christmas break at Sandringham.

Gripping read: Prince Philip clutches his copy of Christopher Kelly's book on Attila the Hun

The hardback book by Christopher Kelly entitled ‘The End of Empire, Attila The Hun And The Fall Of Rome’ was first published in 2010 and tells how the savage warrior king ravaged Rome in the 5th century.

But the book also seeks to show him in a 'compelling new light', and was not just a savage barbarian who inflicted terror on whoever crossed his path.

It was during the same break last year that the Prince was rushed to hospital after developing chest pains on Christmas Eve.

Doctors inserted a small surgical stent to restore blood flow to his heart.

Yesterday, the Queen and her husband discreetly joined more than 50 other unsuspecting passengers on the 10.45am train from King’s Cross station, London.

The First Capital Connect service which had no buffet car or refreshments trolley went via Cambridge and arrived six minutes late at 12.26pm in King’s Lynn, Norfolk.

The Queen, who was wearing a red and
white patterned coat, adjusted her trademark headscarf to protect her 
form the wind and rain as she walked along the platform.

She was followed by four aides carrying bags and the Duke with his book in his hand.

The
couple then went through a side gate into a car park where a Range 
Rover was waiting to drive them seven miles to Sandringham.

Buckingham
Palace is thought to have booked all dozen seats in the rear first 
class compartment of the train to ensure that the pair could sit 
undisturbed with their staff.

One way first class tickets on the train cost £50 each, although it would have been £33 if the Queen had used a senior railcard.

One
passenger said: ‘It is amazing to think that we shared a train with the
Queen. I had no idea that she and Philip were on board until the train 
stopped.’

Attila the Hun invaded the Roman Empire in search of wealth

The date of Attila the Hun's birth is not known, but for the last 20 years of his life he ruled the Hunnic empire, from 434AD to 453AD.

A first-hand account of Attila by the Roman historian Priscus tells us that he was intelligent and extremely modest in his dress, although capable of violent outbursts of anger, which led to him being widely feared by the Roman Empire.

His assaults on their eastern empire were carried out with the help of Goths, Gepids, Rugi, Heruli and others, who he all took under his command.

From the Great Hungarian Plain Attila launched two major campaigns against the eastern empire in 442 and 447 AD, taking many of the major cities of the Balkans and defeating the imperial armies in open battle.

In 451 and 452 AD, he ventured westwards, attacking Gaul and Italy, in raids designed to extract wealth.

He died on the latest of many wedding nights in 453 AD, apparently from a haemorrhage. On his death, his sons quarrelled over succession and the Germanic subject peoples took the opportunity to reassert their independence.

As a result the Hunnic empire waned and in 469 AD Attila's only surviving son, Hernac, himself sought asylum in the eastern empire.
