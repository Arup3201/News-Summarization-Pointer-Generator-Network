Prince Andrew is expected to hold crisis talks with the Queen today as he returned to Britain after a luxury holiday amid the growing furore over claims he had sex with an under-age girl.

The Duke of York last night appeared in public for the first time since he was accused of abusing the girl ‘procured’ for him by his close friend and convicted paedophile, Jeffrey Epstein.

The prince – who looked sombre as he left his luxury £22,000-a-week Swiss ski chalet yesterday – is today expected to meet with his most senior aides and lawyers in his mansion close to Windsor Castle.

It is also understood he will reassure his mother at the earliest possible opportunity that the claims he faces are false.

The extraordinary allegation was made by Virginia Roberts as part of a US civil case against shamed billionaire Epstein. She claims Prince Andrew had sex with her when she was 17 – a minor under US law – and employed as a ‘sex slave’ by Epstein.

The fifth in line to the throne slept with Miss Roberts at an orgy with other under-age girls on Epstein’s private Caribbean island, as well as in a private house in London and in Epstein’s New York mansion, according to the court papers.

Last night her father said Prince Andrew should be prosecuted if the claims were true.

Sky Roberts, 58, also claimed his daughter Virginia had been introduced to the Queen while visiting London with billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein. 

The sexual allegations were robustly denied by Buckingham Palace in an unprecedented three public statements, which describe them as ‘false and without foundation’. 

A spokesman also insisted about allegations about meeting the Queen last night: 'There is nothing to suggest the claim is true. We have no record of such a meeting.'

But the scandal has showed no sign of abating.

Sources close to the prince admitted he had been ‘guilty of a poor choice of friend’, with one saying: ‘I don’t think anyone, not even the duke himself, would defend that friendship.’

There were also questions last night over the extraordinary legal deal that it is thought to have resulted in Prince Andrew – as well as other associates of Epstein – having immunity from any future prosecution.

According to a former Florida state attorney, the controversial deal was struck amid an astonishing and aggressive campaign by Epstein’s lawyers to defend their client against claims of depraved activities.

The deal meant Epstein – who was suspected for decades of paying for sex with dozens of under-age girls – was only ever convicted and jailed for 18 months on a single charge of soliciting paid sex with minors in 2008.

Documents filed at a court in Florida further allege that Prince Andrew was among those who made ‘efforts’ to secure the paedophile a favourable deal.

The legal claim refers to ‘Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the [US] Government to give him a more favourable plea arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince Andrew’. This has been strongly denied by the Palace, with an official telling the Mail yesterday: ‘The duke would never interfere in an active legal case and did not do so in this case.’

FRIDAY: ‘This relates to long-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party. As such we would not comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubt, any suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue.’

SATURDAY AFTERNOON: ‘A very serious allegation, of sex with a minor, was levelled at the duke in a legal document submitted to a US court. The earlier statement categorically rejected that claim; and as was indicated at the time, we do not intend to comment further.’

SATURDAY EVENING: In response to specific claims about Andrew’s alleged conduct: ‘It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts. Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation.’

SUNDAY EVENING: Miss Roberts' father claimed his daughter had been introduced to the Queen - again denied in a statement by the Palace before reiterating the sexual claims are 'without foundation'.

Last night police sources were reported to have said they would investigate if Miss Roberts made a formal complaint against the prince. A Metropolitan Police spokesman told the Daily Telegraph: ‘We have not received any allegations. If we did receive a complaint we would investigate it.’

Andrew has spent the past week holidaying in the upmarket Swiss ski resort of Verbier with his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, their daughter, Princess Eugenie, and pals including Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas.

The prince, who is a keen skier, did not leave the chalet for the last two days of his holiday after the scandal broke.

Pursing his lips pensively yesterday, Prince Andrew walked to his car in full view of waiting photographers, followed a few minutes later by Eugenie, to ensure they were not in the same picture.

Andrew has no immediate public engagements in his diary but the Mail understands that he still plans to fly to Davos in Switzerland for the World Economic Forum on January 21. Sources say he will host a reception there for foreign ministers and business leaders in a personal capacity, as he has done in previous years, as part of a ‘business as usual’ strategy.

One senior royal aide said: ‘There is no suggestion that this will be changed or cancelled. He is pushing forward with his existing schedule.’

Another source said Andrew felt ‘frustrated’ by the scandal, but decided that the seriousness of the allegations being made left him ‘no option but to speak out’. The source added: ‘The duke’s integrity is of utmost importance to him and he felt that was being traduced. We are working in very extraordinary circumstances and the decision was that a line needed to be drawn in the sand.’

It is unlikely, say aides, that Andrew will take legal action against Miss Roberts.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman reiterated their statement that it was ‘emphatically denied’ that the prince had ‘any form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts’.

‘Any claim to the contrary is false and without foundation,’ they said. They added that any suggestion of ‘impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue’.

A £22,000-a-week getaway

Prince Andrew was staying in a £22,000-a-week chalet at the exclusive Swiss ski resort of Verbier as the sex claims emerged in the United States.

The Duke of York was joined by his former wife Sarah Ferguson, their younger daughter Eugenie and Prince Harry’s ex-girlfriend, Cressida Bonas.

Located in one of the most exclusive parts of Verbier, the chalet boasts seven bedrooms, a heated indoor swimming pool, opulent entertaining area and a sauna.

Andrew, 54, is understood to have paid for the hire of the chalet. Looking pensive, he left the chalet yesterday afternoon and was driven to nearby airport, where he boarded a private plane to Britain with Eugenie, 24, and her boyfriend Jack Brooksbank.

Last night it remained unclear who paid for the hire of the jet. Buckingham Palace declined to comment, but sources said the flight had been ‘privately funded’.

During their stay, the royals were guarded by five protection officers – funded by the taxpayer.
