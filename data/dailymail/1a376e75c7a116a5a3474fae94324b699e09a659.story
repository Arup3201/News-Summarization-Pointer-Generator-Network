'Depraved': Paul Wilson, of Birmingham, was jailed for life in 2011 for twice raping a child in a nursery

A nursery teacher raped a girl of 
three after authorities ignored ‘obvious’ warning signs that he was a 
danger to children, a scathing report has found.

Paul
Wilson, 23, was free to abuse the child despite staff repeatedly  
warning Ofsted and the local council that he had developed a ‘special 
relationship’ with her.

A serious case review found that the little girl had been ‘failed by those responsible for caring for her’.

Criminal
record checks were not carried out properly before he was given the job
at the Little Stars Nursery in Nechells, Birmingham, which his mother 
used to manage. She left before he started.

Nursery staff alerted authorities again and again to the fact that Wilson was developing a ‘special relationship’ with the girl.

Wilson took a particular interest in the child, and was seen cuddling and rocking her for hours, refusing to leave her.

Concerned
nursery staff told authorities he had been seen taking the child into 
an adult toilet alone and, on one occasion, had been found alone with 
her in the sleep area of the nursery, with the child hysterically 
crying: ‘I want my mummy.’

Yet despite several warnings over 18 months, neither the council nor Ofsted launched a proper investigation.

The
review was carried out by Birmingham’s Safeguarding Children Board.

It 
said the authorities had been so lax in dealing with the situation that 
Wilson would almost certainly have got away with the abuse had he not 
come to the attention of police separately when a 13-year-old girl 
reported Wilson for grooming her online.

When officers checked his mobile phone they discovered videos of two attacks on the toddler.

Failures: A serious case review said staff at Little Stars nursery knew of concerns about Wilson's behaviour but failed to act

The
case is the latest in a series of catastrophic child protection  
failures by the children’s services department of Labour-run  Birmingham
City Council, which has been rated ‘inadequate’ for the past four 
years.

High profile cases include that of seven-year-old Khyra Ishaq, who was starved to death in 2008.

In May, the department was described as being in ‘utter chaos’ by members of its own watchdog.

The
review found the council and Ofsted both missed ‘obvious pointers’ that
Wilson was a paedophile and ‘missed opportunities to intervene’.

Their 
inaction had ‘supported’ his offences, it said.

Questions: The report said among the failings was a lack of supervision and poor management of the nursery (pictured)

Wilson
started work at the nursery in 2008. In November the following year, a 
few months after the toddler joined, a student teacher on placement at 
the nursery reported Wilson to her college and the council for 
‘inappropriate behaviour’.

No action was taken. Two further complaints were made over the following year, but again nothing was done.

The
‘manipulative’ Wilson was so confident he would not get caught he even 
filed his own complaint about ‘safeguarding issues’ at the nursery.

He
was not pursued about the allegations against him, it was suggested, 
because he was a male teacher, and staff were anxious not to make him 
feel singled out.

Jailed: Wilson was originally sentenced to life with a minimum of 15 years but this was cut by 18 months following an appeal

Wilson 
was eventually caught because of the bravery of the 13-year-old girl he 
had groomed online, one of 22 other victims all aged between 12 and 16.

Once
he had gained their trust, Wilson would get them to commit sexual acts 
which he recorded on webcams before threatening to show the images to 
their family if they spoke out.

In
2011 Wilson was jailed for life for raping the child, grooming 22 other
girls and for more than 40 offences related to grooming young girls on 
the internet and distributing indecent images.

The judge described him 
as ‘chilling, vile and depraved’.

Wilson,
who pleaded guilty, was originally sentenced to serve at least 15 years
of a life  sentence.

But he has since had his minimum term reduced to 
13-and-a-half years to encourage other paedophiles to admit their 
crimes.

Jane Held, chairman
of the Safeguarding Children Board, said: ‘There were unfortunately a 
number of weaknesses in the way that nursery was run and a number of 
opportunities to intervene earlier and prevent the continuation of abuse
which were missed.

‘There 
were obvious pointers that should have raised the alarm, yet both Ofsted
and the local authority failed to recognise them and respond 
appropriately.’

No staff members at Birmingham City Council were sacked or disciplined after the case.

A
council spokesman said it was ‘sorry’ about the failures, but added: 
‘The first responsibility must sit with the perpetrator and with the 
nursery which had a responsibility for checking and supervising.

‘The council had a responsibility in terms of responding to reports of Paul Wilson’s behaviour rather than preventing it. ‘

[The
council] fully acknowledges that a referral to us was not  followed 
through and that this meant that Paul Wilson was able to continue 
undetected for a longer period.’

An
Ofsted spokesman said: ‘We very much regret that our inspection regime 
did not help to stop this dangerous and manipulative child abuser 
sooner.’
