UK Border Agency officers swooped on a packed central London restaurant yesterday and arrested a Middle Eastern man in a raid that was part of a crackdown on illegal immigrants.

Shocked diners looked on as at least four officers turned up in Soho to seize the man from the Breakfast Club restaurant.

He was then frogmarched away and bundled into a cage in the back of a Home Office van.

The UK Border Agency said the man is of Uzbekistan descent and had overstayed his visa.

He now faces deportation from the UK, the Home Office confirmed.

The man, dressed in a red shirt and jeans, was escorted away by two officers - with at least two more present.

Staff at the Breakfast Club confirmed the man did work at the restaurant.

The raid took place at around 1pm and attracted a lot of attention from onlookers.

UK Border Agency staff appeared in Soho in three vans to carry out the raid.

According to one witness, they entered the restaurant through the back entrance before escorting the man out of the front door.

Photographer Ian Allis, a witness, was among a number of members of the public to witness the lunchtime raid.

'There were a lot of people waiting for tables outside the restaurant - and there was a lot of attention,' he said.

'People were truly fascinated. They were coming out of shops from opposite - it is not often you see people being taken away like this.

'What struck me and a few people around me was the size of the cage they put the man in. It wasn't that much bigger than a cage in the back of a dog handler's van.'

A Home Office spokesman told MailOnline: 'Acting on intelligence, Immigration Enforcement visited the Breakfast Club in Dâ€™Arblay Street, Soho, London on August 8 around midday.

'They arrested a 25-year-old male from Uzbekistan who had over-stayed his visa.

'He was detained pending his removal from the UK.'

Last week the Home Office was accused of using heavy-handed tactics during its public hunt for illegal immigrants on Britain's streets.

It came under fire for tweeting the number of people it had arrested in raids.
