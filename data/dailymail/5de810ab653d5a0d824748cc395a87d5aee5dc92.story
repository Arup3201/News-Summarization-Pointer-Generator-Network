One of Australia's biggest airlines has revealed that they are still considering whether to strengthen their cockpit policies following the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 people. 

A Qantas spokesperson told Daily Mail Australia that they are 'monitoring' the information coming out of the French investigation following the chilling revelation that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 locked the pilot out before hurtling the plane to the ground.

The airline say they are in 'discussions with regulators' over cockpit changes and are still unsure if a review is needed to safeguard passengers.

Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies 

'We have a comprehensive safety management system that guards against risks to our operations. This includes multi-layered systems to protect the flight deck on our aircraft,' a spokesperson for Qantas said. 

The airline also said that their pilots' health and well-being are very important to them, claiming they have a rigid recruitment process which includes psychometric testing.

'Periodic aeromedical tests are carried by doctors out once a year for pilots under 40 years old and every six months for pilots over 40,' they said.

'All pilots must complete regular Crew Resource Management training, which among other things includes training in stress management, teamwork, communication and behavioural awareness.

'Like all employees, pilots have access to confidential counselling services and safety reporting channels.' 

In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines

Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened 

A more thorough review had been ordered to consider the findings of the investigation of the Germanwings crash, in which 150 people were killed when the A320 slammed into the French Alps. 

In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. 

They said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew.

However they said that these details remain confidential for security purposes

'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 

'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.' 

It dramatically emerged today that the co-pilot of the Airbus A320 that crashed into the French Alps locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane.

The final moments of the doomed jet were revealed by French prosecutors who said it was 28-year-old Andreas Lubitz's plan to 'destroy the plane'. 

The Qantas review comes as airlines and aviation regulators around the world have begun taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit.

The Civil Aviation Authority urged airlines to review their policies to avoid the pilot or co-pilot being alone at the controls and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across airlines.

In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit.

Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times.

Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons.

A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures.

Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet

'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence.

As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually.

'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards.

'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.'

It also transpired today that the Germanwings co-pilot who flew the plane into the Alps at 400mph had to stop his training because he was suffering from depression and 'burnout'.

Mr Lubitz - whose family were at the scene of the crash in Seyne today -  postponed his pilot training in 2008 due to mental health issues and a friend said he was 'in depression'.

Airline bosses confirmed Lubitz had taken several months off work and had to retrain to join the firm but insisted he was '100% fit to fly'.

German police have since raided Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf.

At an extraordinary press conference earlier, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin gave a disturbing account of the cockpit voice recordings extracted from black box.

He said Lubitz locked his captain out after the senior officer left the flight deck. At that point, Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually - and deliberately. 

He said: 'The intention was to destroy the plane. Death was instant. The plane hit the mountain at 700kmh (430mph).

'I don't think that the passengers realised what was happening until the last moments because on the recording you only hear the screams in the final seconds'.

Earlier in the flight, Mr Robin said Lubitz's responses were initially courteous, but became 'curt' when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing of the plane.

The captain - named by local media as German father-of-two Patrick Sonderheimer - then left the cockpit but found himself locked out when he tried to re-enter.

Mr Robin said: 'We hear the pilot asking the co-pilot to take over and we hear the sound of a chair being pushed back and a door closing so we assume that the captain went to the toilet or something.

'So the co-pilot is on his own, and it is while he's on his own that the co-pilot is in charge of the plane and uses the flight management system to start the descent of the plane.

'At this altitude, this can only be done voluntarily. We hear several shouts from the captain asking to get in, speaking through the intercom system, but there's no answer from the cockpit.'
