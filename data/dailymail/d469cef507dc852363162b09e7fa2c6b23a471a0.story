The daughter-in-law of fugitive Eddie Maher has told how she handed him into U.S. authorities because she feared for her life after finding out his real identity.

Maher - known as 'Fast Eddie' - was jailed for five years for the 1993 theft of a security van containing £1.2million at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday.

The 57-year-old spent almost 20 years on the run in the U.S. before being arrested in February last year.

Double life: Maher with his son Lee King, who was just three when the theft took place, and his wife Jessica, who turned her father-in-law in just months after this wedding day picture in October 2011

The court heard Maher's life 
unravelled when the disgruntled ex-wife of his son, Lee King, contacted U.S. authorities to tell them he was a wanted man.

Today Jessica King  told ITV's Daybreak that she
was not motivated by the £100,000 reward offered by Securicor for the 
capture of Maher and return of the money.

Ms King said: 'I was in fear for my life and to be honest it was just the right thing to do.

'When Eddie found out I knew, he threatened my life so really it had to be done.'

Asked whether the reward had played any part in her decision, she added: 'I didn't even know the reward was real.

Fake IDs: Maher grew a beard and wore over-sized spectacles before applying for a passport in the name of Stephen King (left). He also used bogus driving licences (right) under that name and his brother Michael's

New abode: Within months of fleeing the UK, Maher bought this house in the comfortable Woodland Park neighbourhood of Colorado with $120,000 in cash which police say came from proceeds of his crime

Splashing out: In 1996, the Maher family moved into this home in New Hampshire complete with a hot tub

Life in the fast lane: Another of Maher's homes. Records show that each of his properties was sold on and the money spent. He ended up penniless

'Lee had gone on a rant about it once or twice but I didn't even know that was true until the FBI arrested Eddie.'

She said she had no regrets about her decision and said that, if a reward were forthcoming, it would be 'very welcome'.

'That is in the hands of my lawyer. The money would extremely help, raising a child by yourself is very difficult,' she added.

Scene: The Securicor van Maher was driving disappeared from outside the Lloyds Bank in Felixstowe

Dumped: Maher's Securicor van was found, but minus more than £1million in dozens of bags of cash

Losing his tail: Maher drove the van to nearby Landguard Point in Felixstowe where he got into its secure area and loaded about 30 sacks of cash into this stolen getaway vehicle

Elaborate plan: Maher then used this Opel Ascona as a second getaway vehicle

Covering his tracks: The Opel getaway car was later found torched

Police are set to launch a legal battle to stop Eddie Maher receiving a pension pot worth £125,000, it emerged today.

Maher, 57, who stole £1.2million from his Securicor van in January 1993 was thought to have been penniless when he was arrested in America last year after 19 years on the run.

But police discovered that he had been due a pension from his 12 years as a London firefighter before being forced to retire in 1991 due to a training injury.

Maher who was jailed for five years at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday initially received an index-linked pension of around £300 a month.

But the payments were frozen when he disappeared after stealing £1,172,500 while a colleague was delivering cash to a Lloyds bank in Felixstowe, Suffolk.

Maher who was known as Fast Eddie had no way of collecting his pension while on the run in the U.S. and the payments due to him were retained by the London Fire Brigade.

His monthly pension increased to its current level of £686 due to inflation, swelling the payments due to him to around £125,000 after interest.

Suffolk Police confirmed that specialist financial fraud officers had launched an investigation to see if the money could be seized under the Criminal Justice Act.

During Tuesday's hearing, David Nathan
QC, mitigating, said: 'An extraordinary aspect of this case is Mr 
Maher's daughter-in-law had originally been the partner of his son Lee's
best friend.

'Lee won a lot of money on the lottery and she left her partner to marry Lee.

'When the money ran out, she did a 
little research on Google on the name Maher and found out he was wanted 
for the theft back in 1993.

'She heard that there was a reward and she went to the federal authorities.'

Maher, originally from South Woodham 
Ferrers, Essex, was due to stand trial for theft after being deported 
from the US but changed his plea to guilty.

The court heard that he benefited from the theft outside Lloyds Bank, Felixstowe, to the tune of £200,000.

Police and prosecutors are now 
preparing to retrieve Maher's fire service pension pot - thought to be 
about £125,000 - through court proceedings.

Maher was declared bankrupt in the US and told the court that any money he received from the theft was now gone.

However, it is understood he accrued a pension worth about £600 a month during his time with the London Fire Service.

Legal teams will discuss this during a series of hearings scheduled to take place at Ipswich Crown Court.
