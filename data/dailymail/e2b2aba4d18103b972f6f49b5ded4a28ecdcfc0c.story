NIne people were hurt yesterday as a massive gas blast flattened two houses on an estate.

A retired couple were seriously injured but miraculously no one was killed in the 8.30am explosion.

David Davies, 65, was in bed and his wife Hela, 56, in the kitchen when the huge blast – which neighbours said was ‘like a bomb’ – sent debris flying up to 150 yards along the street in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex.

The couple, who have three grown-up 
children, were rescued from the debris in their pyjamas by shocked 
residents who rushed to help. They were taken to hospital with severe 
burns.

Seven neighbours were
 also taken to hospital following the explosion, which fire chiefs 
believe could have been caused by a badly installed boiler or appliance.

Gary
 Curtis, 27, ran to help rescue Mr and Mrs Davies after the blast 
smashed his windows. ‘It was like a bomb going off, he said. ‘You could 
just hear screams coming from the rubble.

'The
 woman had somehow survived in a protective tunnel that had formed above
 her from the wreckage. When we pulled her out she had burns all up her 
arms, her pyjamas were singed. Her husband was still in bed covered in 
debris.

‘It is a miracle that no one is dead. There is a primary school 100 yards up the road and a bus stop just outside the house.’

Clear-up: Investigators in high-visibility clothing were combing the site in the aftermath of the blast

Devastation: Residents of the local area said the noise of the explosion sounded 'like a bomb'

Blast: Debris was strewn around the street and the rest of the surrounding area after the explosion

The
 Davies’s home in Cloes Lane was destroyed. The adjoining semi was also 
wrecked. Its occupants Jack Whitby, 69, his son Ray, 47, and 
daughter-in-law Kim, 56, were taken to hospital.

Mrs
 Whitby’s son Craig Stagg, 23, had been staying in their loft 
conversion, which was ripped apart – but escaped the blast as he had 
changed his shift as a care worker and was out.

His
 step-brother John Clitheroe, 45, who lives nearby, said: ‘Craig should 
have been there but luckily he swapped his shift with a friend at the 
last minute. It doesn’t bear thinking what could have happened.’

Mrs
 Whitby, a support worker, who suffered cuts and bruises, said: ‘I’ve 
lost everything but I am just happy to be alive – I know we are very 
lucky.

‘I was in bed and I 
just heard a huge bang. The whole ceiling had fallen in and I could see 
into the garden. Some bloke just dragged me out of the rubble and on to 
the pavement.’

St Clare's Roman Catholic primary school in Cloes Lane was also reported to have been evacuated following the blast.

A spokesman for Essex Fire Service, which sent four engines to the scene, said: 'Firefighters have 
been called to an explosion in a house. The house is on fire and there 
are multiple casualties reported.

'Firefighters
 are searching the rubble and dealing with multiple casualties with 
various injuries. The area is being cordoned off and people are being 
asked to avoid the vicinity so that emergency crews can do their work.'

Inside: The contents of the houses were on full display following the explosion which ripped them apart

Smoking: Debris was thrown off from the building, hitting nearby properties

Injuries: Ambulances took 10 local residents to hospital after they were treated by paramedics at the scene

Emergency: Four fire engines were sent to the scene along with five ambulances and two air ambulances

Incident commander Lee Palfreyman 
said that five people had been taken to hospital, one of whom had 
suffered 'life-threatening injuries', while five more were treated at 
the scene.

He added: 'The blast flattened two houses and badly damaged a third. Debris flew in all directions damaging windows and roofs.

'Crews
 are continuing their work at the scene. The evacuation of properties is
 now complete and the Gas Board are in attendance assessing the scene.'

Teresa Reed, a lollipop lady who lives in the area, described hearing a 'huge bang' as she walked to work.

'Apparently
 people heard it in the middle of town but I had no idea what it was,' 
she added. 'It shook the ground and knocked people out of bed.'

Andrew
 Woodfield wrote on Twitter: 'My whole house just shook like an 
explosion gone off in Clacton or something! Anyone know anything??'

Scott
 Chamberlain tweeted: 'What the hell was that? Sounded like an explosion
 somewhere, the whole house shook and can now hear A LOT of sirens?!'
