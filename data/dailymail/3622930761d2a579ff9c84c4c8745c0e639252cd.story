The Israeli military says two soldiers have been killed and a further seven wounded in a Hezbollah 'revenge attack' on a military convoy near the Lebanese border today.

Israel's military responded to the anti-tank missile strike on the convoy with aerial and ground attacks on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon.  

The Hezbollah group struck the nine-vehicle convoy with several missiles in an apparent retaliation for a deadly Israeli airstrike in Syria that killed six Hezbollah fighters earlier this month.

A Spanish U.N. peacekeeper was also killed in today's clash.

Israel, which initially reported unspecified casualties on the Israeli side, responded by firing at least 50 artillery shells into Lebanon in a significant escalation along the volatile border today. 

The violence was the deadliest Hezbollah attack on Israel since a 2006 war between the two sides. 

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman, said there were Israeli casualties in the attack, but did not elaborate.

Tensions in the region, where the frontiers of Israel, Lebanon and Syria meet and militant groups opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad are active, have been bubbling for months but have boiled over in the past 10 days. 

There were initial reports on Lebanese media that an Israeli soldier was captured during the attack, but the Israeli army denied it, as did a Lebanese political source. 

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would respond 'forcefully.'

In a statement, Hezbollah said its fighters destroyed a number of Israeli vehicles that were carrying Israeli officers and soldiers and caused casualties among 'enemy ranks.'

It said the attack was carried out by a group calling itself the 'heroic martyrs of Quneitra' - suggesting it was in retaliation for an Israeli airstrike on the Golan Heights on January 18 that killed six Hezbollah fighters and an Iranian general.

Hezbollah member Mohammad Issa was killed in the airstrike. He was the highest-ranking among the group, and was among the senior cadres who headed the group's operations in Syria.

The Israeli military said an anti-tank missile hit an Israeli military vehicle near the Israeli-Lebanese border today, and  residents of the area had been ordered to remain in their homes.

An hour later, mortars were fired at several Israeli military locations on Mount Dov and Mount Hermon, the Israeli military said. 

No injuries were reported in that attack. 

The military said it responded with fire toward Lebanese positions, and evacuated Israeli visitors from a ski resort in the area.

The flare-up recalled the beginning of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon war, which was sparked by a Hezbollah attack on an Israeli military vehicle along the border and the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers.

The Israeli military said there was no indication that any Israeli soldiers captured in the attack.

But the latest salvos raised the possibility of renewed fighting along the Lebanese-Israel border, which has remained mostly quiet since a month-long war in the summer of 2006.

Since then, Israel has responded with airstrikes and artillery fire following a number of rocket attacks and shootings but the violence remained contained.

Today's attack took place near Mount Dov and Shebaa Farms, a disputed tract of land where the borders of Israel, Lebanon and Syria meet.

Hanna Bikel, a spokeswoman for Ziv Hospital in Safed, said four to six people with light wounds from the strike were on their way to the hospital. 

She declined to say whether they were soldiers or civilians.

Two Lebanese officials said the Israeli shelling targeted the border villages of Majidiyeh, Abbasiyeh and Kfar Chouba near the Shebaa Farms area.

Two sources told AFP that more than a dozen shells had been fired on Lebanese border villages and that Israeli warplanes were flying over the area.

There was no immediate information on casualties. 

'At least 15 shells have been fired against five villages in the south,' one security source said, adding that Majidiyeh village was hardest hit.

Another security source said the Israeli army was firing a shell into the area about every two minutes, and was using artillery as well as tanks. 

Images broadcast from the scene on Israeli television showed large plumes of white smoke billowing across the area.

Police have sealed off several roads close to the border in northern Israel.

U.N. spokesman Andrea Tenenti said a peacekeeper was killed in circumstances the U.N. was still investigating.

The Spanish Defense Ministry identified the dead peacekeeper as Corporal Francisco Javier Soria Toledo, 36. 

The Israeli military said it was responding to the incident with aerial and ground strikes on Hezbollah positions

Spanish Foreign Minister Jose Manuel Garcia-Margallo told reporters he received a phone call from Israel's ambassador to Spain, offering condolences.

In a statement, Israel's Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that he conveyed Israel's condolences for the death in a conversation with his Spanish counterpart.

The UN peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL has been in south Lebanon since 1978.

One of the Lebanese officials said the incident is believed to be a 'sophisticated Hezbollah operation' targeting Israeli vehicles along the border.

Families living on the border of the villages fled further within, fearing they'd be hit, said the officials, who are based in south Lebanon. 

Celebratory gunfire echoed in Shiite-dominated areas of Beirut, while in some areas, nervous parents hurried to pick up their children from school and hunker home.

Reports suggest in Gaza Palestinian militant groups praised Hezbollah. 

Prime Minister Netanyahu, speaking at an event in southern Israel, warned that Israel's enemies would face a fate similar to Hamas, the rulers of the Gaza Strip who fought a brutal 50-day war against Israel last summer.

'To anyone who is trying to challenge us on the northern border I suggest looking at what happened here, not far from the city of Sderot, in the Gaza Strip. 

'Hamas was dealt its heaviest blow ever since its founding and the Israel Defense Forces is prepared to act forcefully in all areas,' he said.
