A Texas woman who claims her military husband's deployment overseas left her too stressed to care for their three young children, one of whom starved to death, is now standing trial.

The trial for Tiffany Klapheke, now 23, who is charged with injury to a child in the August 2012 death of Tamryn Klapheke, started Wednesday.

The child was found dead of malnutrition and dehydration, as well as covered in chemical burns, in Klapheke's Abilene home and witnesses have now testifying to the unthinkably squalid conditions in Klapheke's Abiline home.

'I just got tired of always changing the sheets': Tamryn Klapheke (right), aged just 22-months, suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died. Her mother Tiffany (left) said it was depression over her military husband's deployment that made her do it

Prosecutors said Klapheke had kept the child locked in a room for four days before she found her dead in her crib and called 911.

Investigators told the Taylor County jury of a stench of urine and feces that prevailed in the Klapheke home when they arrived. And Abilene police Detective Earnest Moscarelli said some rooms in the house were covered in feces.

Matthew Jones, a retired Air Force master sergeant, was a Dyess Air Force Base security officer in August 2012 and the first investigator to arrive at the Klapheke home after the woman had called 911.

He said the smell of urine and feces in the house 'hit you in the face like a tennis racket.' Jones said he could not wash the stench from his uniform afterward and had to discard it.

Less than a week before a 22-month-old child was found dead in her urine-soaked bed, a Child Protection Services supervisor closed the case - despite it being 11 months since the home had been visited.

Tamryn Klapheke suffered from dehydration and malnutrition and weighed only 17.5 pounds when she died. She also had chemical burns on her face and body, indicating she was exposed to human waste for a long period of time.

Klapheke had told investigators that the overseas deployment of her husband, an airman at the nearby Air Force base, left her too stressed to care for their three children.

Though neglect had been ruled out in all three, between the last visit and the time of Tamryn's death, a lot had changed within the home.

Tiffany Klapheke had given birth to a
 third girl, lost her job and said goodbye to her husband Thomas, who 
had been deployed to Oman.

'I just got tired of always changing the sheets, so it was on there a little bit longer than it should have been,' she said.

Klapheke
 recalled her impatience over her children's potty training, saying she 
left her toddler in the crib in her own urine for nearly a week.

CPS records show that she had a boyfriend in the home at the time of Tamryn's death, also an active duty service member.

In
 opening statements, defense attorney George Parnham spoke of sexual 
abuse and neglect that Klapheke suffered growing up in foster homes. He 
also said she suffers from reactive attachment disorder, which is 
usually found in children who cannot form healthy attachments with 
parents or caregivers because of past neglect or abuse.

Air Force airman Thomas Klapheke has divorced his wife and the state has temporary conservatorship of the children, with their father granted restrictive custody

'Insanity
 is not an issue here,' Parnham said. 'We are all born into this world 
without a choice of the circumstances in which we are born.'

Prosecutor
 Arimy Beasley acknowledged that Klapheke's upbringing was traumatic and
 tragic, but that did not absolve her of possible fatal neglect.

If convicted, Klapheke could receive a sentence of up to life imprisonment.

Felonies: The young mother is charged with three felony counts of injury to a child in connection with her 22-month-old daughter's death and the severe neglect of her two other daughters. She herself grew up in foster homes, a background that defense attorneys will likely use during the trial
