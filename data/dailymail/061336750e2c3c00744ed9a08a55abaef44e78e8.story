Missing: Retired teacher Carol Sheridan, 73, has been found dead after she went missing for ten days

Police have found the body of a 73-year-old great-grandmother who went missing nearly ten days ago.

Officers found Carol Sheridan, who had been missing in the French Alps since October 27, today.

Family and friends of the retired schoolteacher, who went went missing in the town of Habère-Poche in the Rhône-Alpes region, have paid tribute to her.

The tragic news was announced via a Facebook page set up to coordinate the search for Mrs Sheridan originally from Salford in Greater Manchester.

'I am very sad to announce that French authorities recovered Carol’s body this morning, near to where her car was found a few days ago,' said a message by Sheridan’s grandson Simon, The Local reports.

'There are no further details from the police at the moment,' the post added.

He said he was taking comfort from the fact she died doing something she loved.

He said: 'We would like to thank everyone who helped in the search, whether by sharing through social media, contacting the press or actually going out and looking. Your efforts meant the world to us; they made us feel supported and they showed us how loved she was - that so many people were so desperate to find her.

'Thank you also for the messages of support and sympathy over the last week. They have helped our family through a very difficult time.

'Carol was an amazing woman who lived an amazing life. She was dearly loved by many and will be hugely missed by all of us. Personally, I am taking some comfort in that her last moments were spent doing something she loved.'

Friends and acquaintances of Sheridan, described by her granddaughter as a 'wonderful, generous, kind woman,' have taken to Facebook to offer moving tributes to the retired school teacher, remembered as an adventurous woman who was 'full of life'.

'She was an impressive woman who gave so much to others and in later life, by doing what she loved, she was an inspiration to many,' said one.

'My life is enriched by knowing this remarkable soul,' said another.

Sheridan's black Fiat Panda 4x4 vehicle was discovered by police on Monday, a development which her grandaughter Heather Tanton told the Hull Daily Mail had brought 'mixed feelings'.

'We are pleased they have found something but, in a way, we aren't pleased they have found something. It is better than knowing nothing but we are very anxious,' she said.

The mother-of-two, who has previously lived in Monte Carlo and is a fluent French speaker, usually contacts family and friends daily via social networking sites, e-mail and telephone, but when no one heard from her, her relatives started the search.

Her daughter Fiona Conyers, who lives in New Zealand, co-ordinated a poster campaign and informed French radio stations, locals from the village and also reached out to the mountain community online.

She said of the search: 'Our main focus at this point is to find her car.

'The area in which she is thought to be missing is vast.

'We are relying on the public to help us find the car. If we find the car, we find mum, it's that simple.'

Mrs Sheridan, a grandmother-of-ten and
great-grandmother-of-four, moved to France from her home in Driffield, 
East Yorks, two years ago.

She was last seen by her neighbour as she drove off in her car to embark on her walk in the Alps.

During the search, her family spoke of their hope that she would be found alive as she was a keen walker and 'as fit as a fiddle'.

Mrs
Sheridan's grandaughter, Heather Tanton, 25, said: 'This is just so out
of character for my nan. She'd never go this long without telling us 
where she is.

'She'd know 
we'd be worried and mainly she'd love to be showing off pictures of what
she'd been doing, so to not hear from her is really worrying.

'She speaks to her daughter in New Zealand every day.

'She
puts pictures of places she's been and hills she's climbed on Facebook 
every day, showing all her friends what she's been up to.'

Miss Tanton, who lives with 
28-year-old partner Mark Owen, a plumber, and their two daughters Zara, 
four, and two-year-old Sophie in Brough, East Yorkshire, said: 'She's 
fit as a fiddle and so resourceful and I'm hoping that's what's keeping 
her going wherever she is.

'She isn't your normal 73-year-old - she's like Bear Grylls, she can light a fire anywhere and will eat anything.'

Mrs Sheridan, who divorced in her late 30s, was a school teacher for years and worked more recently as a conveyancer and tax inspector before she retired.

She returned to Driffield a few years ago to look after Heather's mother Elaine who fell ill before moving back out to France.
