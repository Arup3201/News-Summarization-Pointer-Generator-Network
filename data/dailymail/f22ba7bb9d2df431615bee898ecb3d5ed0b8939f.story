Seattle Seahawks player Richard Sherman is expecting his first son 'any day now'.

And prays to God the little boy waits until after the Super Bowl. 

The 26-year-old cornerback said he and his girlfriend Ashley Moss 'have things in place in case that happens' - but added 'hopefully and God willing we won't have to cross that bridge.'

Nonetheless, Moss is ready for a possible Super Bowl Baby, having traveled to Arizona from Seattle to watch Sherman play the New England Patriots - at their second Super Bowl in a row.

Any day now: Seattle Seahawks' Richard Sherman and his girlfriend Ashley Moss are soon to be parents

Plans in place: The couple are well aware their first son could arrive during the Super Bowl on Sunday

'I pretty much told him, 'I'm coming, either you pack a bag or I pack a bag,'' she told USA Today.

'If you see Richard heading for the locker room right after it hits zero in the fourth quarter, don't be surprised.' 

She added that they have already picked the name but will keep it a secret until the birth.  

In next week's issue of Sport's Illustrated, Sherman opens up about the example he plans to set for his son.

He explained: 'I've realized in the last year that I can evoke change by being a great role model: a man who respects women and police officers, who graduated from college and does everything in his power to be successful within the rules. 

'I pretty much told him, 'I'm coming, either you pack a bag or I pack a bag,'' Moss revealed

Moss said the team has been very supportive and Sherman is ready to run from the field if the baby comes

This will be Sherman's second Super Bowl in a row, after playing the New England Patriots last year

'Circumstances dictate where you start — a single mother raised Kam Chancellor to become the man he is today — but each individual determines his course.

'Where I came from, in Compton, kids were brainwashed into thinking that if they weren't athletes or rappers or drug dealers they were nothing. 

'My son will understand that he's in control of his own destiny and that education, work ethic and discipline will guide him to an even better life than I've enjoyed. 

Excited: Sherman and Moss have already selected a name for their son but will keep it a secret

'He'll be the man who makes this world a better place through positive actions and influence.'

This weekend, however, Sherman is focused on football.

Speaking at a news conference on Thursday, he said: 'I did not know it was a topic of national debate, honestly.

'I'm focused on the game right now. He's not supposed to come on Sunday. But I think he's a disciplined man and will wait.

'I would not like to miss the birth of my first son, my first kid.'
