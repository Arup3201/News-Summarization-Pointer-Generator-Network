There are two package thieves on the loose in California, police warned residents on Wednesday.

The first incident occurred on November 25 on Edinger Avenue in Huntington Beach and the homeowner was able to capture footage of the suspect with a home surveillance camera.

The suspect was seen wearing blue jeans, sunglasses, and holding a red clipboard.

First incident: This suspect is seen approaching a home to allegedly steal from it and hides his face in sunglasses as he marches forward with a red clipboard 

Escape vehicle: The suspect was seen leaving in this BMW along with a pair of expensive shoes 

Footage shows the shady man leaving in what appears to be a black BMW with an expensive pair of shoes he allegedly nabbed.

KTLA reports that there is footage of the same suspect stealing a package from the another home, one belonging to James Fleming on December 6.

The thief stole an envelope that had a Bank of America credit card inside and made around 1,000 in charges on the card, says Fleming.

Another thief also captured in surveillance at Fleming's home was taped stealing a package that had a purse inside.

Lt. Keith Ferrin told KTLA reporters that for the two thefts at Fleming's home the suspects are thought to have followed UPS trucks.

Fleming told reporters he's confident Huntington police will track down the suspects.  

Hunting Beach Independent reports that police are asking the public to take preventative measures to make sure packages aren't stolen. 

They can do things like request that a signature be required for delivery, use a tracking service, or ask a neighbor to be on the lookout for a package.
