An audio recording has emerged of the moment the driver of the derailed train which caused the Lac-Megantic train disaster was told it was his vehicle at fault.

The recorded phone conversations between train driver Tom Harding and a dispatcher referred to only as RJ show how the driver had no idea it was his train which has rolled off the tracks and exploded in the Quebec town.

When the news is broken to him you can hear Harding shout: 'She was f***ing secure. F***!' before adding: 'Oh, Jesus Christ….How in the f*** did that thing f***ing roll down, RJ?'

Smoke rises from railway cars that were carrying crude oil after derailing in downtown Lac-Megantic, Quebec

The train, which was carrying 72 carloads of volatile oil from North Dakota, had been parked on a railway line for the night when it derailed, hurtled down an incline and slammed into downtown Lac-Megantic on July 6 last year. Several train cars exploded and 40 buildings were levelled. 

Parts of the town were evacuated in the early hours of the morning as fireballs shot high into the sky, flames spread to nearby homes and thick acrid smoke filled the air.

The audio recording, obtained by CBC Radio-Canada, also shows how it was Harding who initially alerted railway company Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways to the disaster, before he realised his involvement.

He told the dispatcher: 'Everything is on fire - from the church all the way down to the Metro, from the river all the way to the railway tracks. From what I can see, RJ, the box cars have all burnt in the yard - the ties, everything. Whatever is in the yard, rolling stock, is now gone - completely.'

The accident resulted in 47 of the town's residents being burnt to death, and lawsuits have been brought against the now bankrupt company. 

The weak safety culture at Montreal, Maine & Atlantic Railways and poor government oversight were among the many factors that led to the oil train explosion, Canada's Transportation Safety Board said in a new report released on Tuesday.

TSB chair Wendy Tadros said 18 factors played a role, including a rail company that cut corners and a Canadian regulator that didn't do proper safety audits. 

'We now know why the situation developed over time,' Tadros told a news conference in Lac-Megantic. 'A weak safety culture at MMA, poor training of employees, tank cars that didn't offer enough protection.'

The TSB, which is responsible for investigating rail, air and marine accidents, blamed another government agency, Transport Canada, for failing in its oversight duties.

'And then Transport Canada didn't audit railways often enough and thoroughly enough to know how those companies were really managing, or not managing, risk,' Tadros said.

TSB chief operating officer Jean Laporte called Montreal, Maine & Atlantic's operations 'dubious' and said the railway chose to limit the speed on certain routes instead of improving its equipment. 'People only did the bare minimum to get the job done rather than always following the rules,' Laporte said.

In May, the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Canada Co. and three of its employees, including Harding, were charged by Quebec prosecutors with 47 counts of criminal negligence causing death. Class-action lawsuits are pending.

The crash, the worst railway accident in Canada in nearly 150 years, prompted intense public pressure to make oil trains safer. Canada's transport minister said in April that the type of tankers involved in the disaster must be retired or retrofitted within three years because they are prone to rupturing. 

*1.47am: Tom Harding (TH) calls RJ* 

TH: Everything is on fire - from the church all the way down to the Metro, from the river all the way to the railway tracks. From what I can see, RJ, the box cars have all burnt in the yard - the ties, everything. Whatever is in the yard, rolling stock, is now gone - completely.

RJ: Uh, is it, is it the train that roll... run down?

TH: No. I have all of the police here around me ‘cause they know I work for the railway. We got a loaded train up at Nantes, it’s OK. We got an empty fuel train up at Vachon, it’s OK.

RJ: OK.

TH: Flames, RJ, are 200 feet high. It’s incredible, you can’t believe it here. From the river right to the station…

RJ: What the f*** happened?

TH: I don’t know. I don’t know, but everything, everything… I woke up 20 minutes ago. Evacuate, evacuate, right away.

*3.29am: TH calls RJ*

RJ: It’s uh, it’s your train that rolled down.

TH: No!

RJ: Yes, sir.

TH: No, RJ.

RJ: Yes, sir.

TH: Holy f**k. F**k!

*** 

TH: She was f***ing secure. F**k!

RJ: That’s what, that’s what I got as a news.

TH: And when did you get the news? Few minutes ago?

RJ: At 2.25, to be correct.

TH: Oh, Jesus Christ.

RJ: Since then, the phone is, it just stopped ringing for a couple of minutes there.

TH: Just now?

RJ: Yeah. Since midnight it’s been ringing like hell.

TH: Oh, f**k. So that means… holy f**k.

RJ: Yeah.

TH: How in the f**k did that thing f***ing roll down, RJ?

RJ: I don’t know. How many brakes did you put on?

TH: The units, the V.B., and the first car. Seven brakes.
