The idea of traveling from Los Angeles to San Francisco in half an hour sounds like the work of an imaginative science fiction writer.

But when space engineer and billionaire Elon Musk suggests the idea, people sit up and take notice.

His latest project which will be revealed in detail next month, is called the 'Hyperloop'.

The aim would be to transport people 380 miles up the Golden State coast from LA to San Francisco.

Elon Musk will reveal his 'alpha design' for a 'hyperloop' super train next month. Many people have tried to guess how the proposed transport system might work but engineer John Gardi's explanation (pictured) has come the closest so far, according to the tech entrepreneur

It currently takes around 12 hours on 
the Coast Line train to make the journey between the two cities, eight 
hours in a car and one and half hours to fly.

It
 would use solar panels for power and use small pods, leaving 'whenever 
you arrive' instead of sticking to a schedule like an airliner.

Elon Musk has described his supertrain as a cross between 'a Concorde, a rail gun, and an air-hockey table'.

Now many are starting to speculate exactly how this next-generation transportation scheme would work.

An alternative theory, put forward by physicist Brian Dodson, suggests the hyperloop could be a pneumatic transport system consisting of a closed tube making loops between Los Angeles and San Francisco. The idea was inspired by plans proposed during the early 1900s, pictured

From the few details he has revealed so far, simple maths would suggest the vehicle would have to travel at more than 600 mph.

So far, Japan's Maglev train is the only thing that comes close.

Its top speed is 361mph although it usually travels closer to 300 mph.

Jim
 Powell, co-inventor of the bullet train and current director of Maglev 
2000, thinks that’s as fast as open-air rail lines will ever go.

'Air drag becomes too much of a problem after 300 mph, just from a power point of view,' Powell told The Verge.

'And then that air drag starts to generate noise. You wouldn’t want an airplane flying past your house at 600 mph.'

The
 Hyperloop would solve that by enclosing the craft in a tube, creating a
 sealed environment that a car could move through with as little 
friction as possible.

What 
would drive the vehicle forward? The best guess so far is akin to that 
used on an air hockey table with accelerated air propelling cars through
 the Hyperloop, with room on either end for it to speed up or slow down.

The idea would be to reduce friction as much as possible, but generating air at 600 mph is no easy task.

The top secret hyperloop train will take passengers along a route from Los Angeles to San Francisco, pictured, in a mere half hour.
In a tweet, the Tesla Motors co-founder behind the plans promised to publish the alpha design by 12 August

Another
 expert, George Maise has suggested removing all air from the tube 
altogether and leaving the cars to travel through a vacuum which would 
eliminate any drag.

'If you 
have a vacuum in a tube, then you have zero drag,'There's no limit on 
the speed, really, but keeping a column of air traveling at nearly 
supersonic speeds would require a huge amount of energy to maintain.'

Of
 course, without worrying about the technology, the track or tube as has
 been proposed, the thing needs to be built ant that means clearing a 
straight line between the two cities.

Unlike a railroad track or an interstate, turns will be difficult.

It's the same kind of problem as faced by the 'bullet train'-style Maglev tracks.

High speeds pull passengers to the side and even gentle shifts can make passengers sick.

A straight line would also mean the project would have to travel through some populated areas.

ET3,
 a Colorado-based group that's built a number of vacuum-based 
transportation prototypes has suggested building vertically on concrete 
pillars, just a couple meters across.

The result looks more like power lines than a super-highway and it could mean less complaints from the neighbors.

The tech entrepreneur claims that his hyperloop super train could be three to four times faster than a ballet train like this one from the East Japan Railway. However he has plenty of problems to overcome from finding a business partner to obtaining land for this ambitious transport project

Elon Musk claims that his hyperloop super train will connect the Californian cities of Los Angeles (Venice Beach is pictured left) and San Francisco (right) with journey times of just 30 minutes

Ultimately, even the experts don't have the answers at this point in time.

Mr
 Musk is the CEO of SpaceX, the first private company to send supplies 
to the International Space Station as well as founding PayPal and 
electronic car manufacturer Tesla Motors.

Musk said that he will publish an 'alpha design' for his ambitious transportation project on 12 August.

He
 said that the system will never crash, is immune to weather, is three 
or four times faster than a conventional bullet train and travels twice 
as fast as the average speed of an aircraft.

He
 has also reportedly said that the ambitious system could be powered by 
solar energy and even generate more energy that it would use.

Musk believes the super fast service would have a build cost of around $6bn.

While
 this might sound like a lot, current plans for a bullet train service 
between L.A. and San Francisco with a time of around 3 hours is 
predicted to cost in the region of $68bn.

'Other than what Musk has announced, I don't think anyone knows what his ideas are,' says ET3 founder Daryl Oster.

The
 promise of a half-hour trip across California is genuinely 
world-changing, and unlike most entrepreneurs, Musk has a track record 
that suggests he could make it happen.

However, the technology required for the hyperloop could be so far-fetched that its both magical and yet virtually impossible.

'If
 somebody other than Musk had proposed this, I would say it's very 
suspect,' George Maise says. 'I really have no idea how you do this.'
