It is news that will be welcome to anyone infuriated by Stephen Fry’s incessant swearing during the Baftas awards ceremony last weekend.

The broadcaster says he is going to fall silent.

The 57-year-old who is known both for his verbosity and as a prolific tweeter, broke the news of his self-imposed silence to his eight million Twitter followers yesterday.

The Tweet linked to his own website where he explained the reason behind his decision 

He wrote: ‘Dearest Twitter followers and other interested (or bored) parties. Just a quick note to say that I’m going to be away until May. During that time I will be taking a holiday from Twitter and, with a few exceptions, not tweeting at all.’

The star said that a few automatic tweets would still appear, but that it would not mean he was logging on or monitoring his Twitter feed. Fry, who announced his recent marriage to his 27-year-old partner Elliott Spencer on the social media site, signed off: ‘Well, off I go. Have a wonderful time without me. I know you will.’

Fry faced criticism for swearing and making sexual references while presenting last weekend’s Baftas at the Royal Opera House. The recorded version of the night was broadcast on BBC1 at 9pm on Sunday, and prompted a number of complaints.

Last month, Fry revealed his plans for his travels with Spencer, saying: ‘We’re delaying our honeymoon until after the Baftas so I can relax for longer. We’re planning a huge adventure.

‘We’re going to start in Cuba because it’s one of my favourite countries in the world and we’ve got a romantic hideaway. And then we’ll go to about three or four more countries.’

Fry added: ‘I’m very happy. We both are.’
