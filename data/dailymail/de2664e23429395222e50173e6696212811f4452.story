Diafra Sakho admits he is relishing the prospect of building a relationship with fellow West Ham forward Enner Valencia.

The summer arrivals have looked like a well-established partnership in their last two games for the Hammers, both getting amongst the goals in the draw at Hull and Saturday's impressive 3-1 victory over Liverpool.

Sakho, 24, joined from Metz having led the scoring charts for the French outfit as they gained promotion to Ligue 1 and has since scored three goals in three starts for West Ham.

His goal on Saturday came after Winston Reid's opener as he deftly lofted the ball over stranded Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet and, whilst confirming he meant the audacious effort, the Senegal international is ready to work on his blossoming understanding with Valencia.

'I saw the 'keeper off his line, at the near post, and I only had one thing in mind,' he told West Ham TV.

'I tried it and it came off. I wasn't sure if it was going to go in or not, but thankfully it's ended up in the net. I'm pleased, pleased for me and for the team. I've dreamed of scoring a goal as good as that, particularly here at the Boleyn Ground.'

Regarding Valencia, he added: 'We've trained together for a short while now. Enner's a footballer who likes to get it down and play, and me, I like to come deep. I try to position myself in relation to him and vice-versa. I hope that's going to continue to serve the club well this season.

'We're working every day in training for that. We're not going to relax and we'll carry on working hard at it, because it's only the beginning of the season and there will be plenty of matches to play together.'

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce believes Sakho has benefited from the spotlight being drawn by the big-money signing of Valencia, who starred at the World Cup for Ecuador.

The duo will both be licking their lips at the prospect of coming up against Manchester United's shaky defence on Saturday but, even if the goals start to dry up for Sakho, he is ready to do his bit for the team as West Ham look to build on their win over Liverpool.

'Goals are why I'm here and that's why West Ham signed me,' he added. 'But beyond that I'll try to help the team, as much as I possibly can.

And even if I don't score, as long as I'm useful, that's the important thing. I work every day in training to try to be as effective as possible.

'We deserved it (the result against Liverpool). On the whole, we lived up to manager's expectations and those of the staff. And if we continue to play like that, work together, united as a group, we'll do good things in the Premier League.'
