Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has blasted Michael Gove's suggestion that the Queen should receive a new Royal Yacht as a gift in recognition of her Diamond Jubilee.

Mr Gove, the Education Secretary, made the suggestion in a letter to Mr Clegg and Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, who is overseeing the celebrations.

In it, Mr Gove said the celebrations 'should go beyond those of previous jubilees and mark the greater achievement that the diamond anniversary represents'.

But he has been forced to defend himself today after Mr Clegg dismissed the extravagance because hard-up voters don't want to see a debate between 'the haves and have-yachts.'

Queen's pride and joy: Michael Gove wants a replacement for the Royal Yacht Britannia in recognition of the Diamond Jubilee

The Deputy Prime Minister said: 'Most
people in the country would think the diamond jubilee is a wonderful 
occasion for us to celebrate together as a community and as a nation.

'But I suspect that most people in 
the country would think, given that there is very little money around, 
that this probably would not be the top of their list of priorities for 
the use of scarce public resources.'

He joked that it was a case of 'the haves and the have yachts' - before apologising for the poor quality of his quip.

Last year the Daily Mail launched a 
campaign for an £80million majestic new Royal Yacht to replace Britannia
– but one which is funded by donations, rather than by the taxpayer.

Today David Cameron also said that public money should not be used to pay for a new Royal Yacht.

Mr Cameron's spokesman said: 'Clearly
there is a difficult economic situation, there are scarce resources, 
and therefore we don't think it would be an appropriate use of public 
money at the present time.'

Calls: Mr Gove, left, wrote a private letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt to say that he felt the Queen, pictured attending a church service yesterday, should be given a new Royal Yacht as a lasting legacy to her reign as monarch

Labour Party deputy chairman Tom Watson said: 'We're all looking forward to the diamond jubilee. The significance of the occasion should be celebrated across the country.

'But Michael Gove has shown he is out of touch with this proposal.

'When school budgets are being 
slashed, parents will be wondering how Gove came even to suggest this 
idea. This is not the time to spend £60 million on a yacht.'

But Mr Gove, stung by the criticism, 
said today in the House of Commons that he did not intend for public 
money to be used for the vessel.

How the Mail launched its campaign for a new royal yacht for the Queen's Jubilee

'The letter which I wrote to the 
Prime Minister on September 12 clearly stated that I agree of course the
project for a royal yacht, the future ship project for the 21st 
century, was one - and I was quite clear in my letter - where no public 
funding should be provided,' said Mr Gove.

According to The Guardian, 
the leaked letter was addressed to Mr Clegg and Culture Secretary Jeremy
Hunt and said that a private donation could be sought if insufficient 
taxpayer funds were available.

The Royal Yacht Britannia was 
decommissioned by the Labour government in December 1997 – following an 
initial decision by John Major’s government – and was the only time the 
Queen has been seen to cry in public.

Former Tory foreign secretary Lord 
Hurd has described the decision to decommission the yacht as the 
greatest mistake of John Major’s time in power.

Britannia is now a visitor attraction in Edinburgh and was moved to a 
dry dock earlier this month after it began taking on water due to a 
faulty door seal.

The new vessel proposed by the Daily 
Mail would have £80million construction costs and would be funded by 
donations from individuals and corporations.

The 21st century successor to Britannia would be in keeping with Britain’s historic role as a great maritime nation.

Codenamed FSP21 (Future Ship Project 
21st Century), the 515ft four-masted ship would incorporate the very 
latest materials and technology. The plans include royal quarters and 
state rooms for grand diplomatic and corporate events. Run by a 
charitable trust, it would cover its own costs — through everything from
trade exhibitions to training sea cadets.

The new ship would require teams of young people, known as ‘Queen’s cadets’, to clamber aloft in all weathers to keep it going.

The 412-foot Royal Yacht Britannia 
was launched in April 1953 at John Brown’s Clydebank Shipyard and served
the Queen for 44 years, carrying her and the Royal Family on 968 
official voyages.

It travelled 1,087,623 nautical miles, calling at more than 600 ports in 135 countries.

Prince Charles and Princess Diana, 
Princess Margaret, Princess Anne and the Duke and Duchess of York all 
honeymooned on it and last July Zara Phillips and England rugby star 
Mike Tindall hosted a pre-wedding party on board the vessel which was 
attended by Princes William and Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge.

The ship is now owned by The Royal 
Britannia Trust, a charitable organisation whose sole remit is the 
maintenance of Britannia in keeping with its former role.
