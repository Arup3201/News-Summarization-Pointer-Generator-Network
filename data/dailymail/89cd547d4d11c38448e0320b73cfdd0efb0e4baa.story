Leeds United captain Stephen Warnock is poised to join Derby County, possibly as early as Monday.

Steve McClaren has been in pursuit of a left back to support Craig Forsyth and it is believed Warnock could be allowed to leave Elland Road on a free transfer despite playing 22 times for the club this term.

Warnock, 33, is one of the highest earners at Leeds and his deal, signed in January 2013, expires at the end of this season.

McClaren has already secured Darren Bent on loan from Aston Villa and is close to bringing centre-back Raul Albentosa to Derby in a £470,000 deal.

'He (Albentosa) is someone we have pursued and we are trying to do a deal,' said McClaren. 'We are looking at him and we are interested but I don’t know where we are at the present moment with it.’
