Turnout in Scotland’s independence referendum is expected to be very high, but surely not as big as CNN was predicting on Thursday night.

In a news report on the network’s evening broadcast, a graphic appeared on screen which showed that Scotland has given the independence referendum 110 percent.

According to the graphic, 58 percent of Scots had said ‘yes,’ and 52 percent voted ‘no,’ which adds up to 110 percent of the country's populace.

After the polls closed late on Thursday, turnout in the referendum was expected to be extremely high – although not quite as high as CNN’s projections.

The first numbers released early in the early hours of Friday morning in Scotland were turnout totals for two regions - 84 percent and 89 percent - suggesting that the number of voters could hit a record high.

Eager voters had lined up outside some polling stations even before they opened on Thursday. More than 4.2 million people had registered to vote - 97 percent of those eligible - including residents as young as 16.

For some, it was a day they had dreamed of for decades. For others, the time had finally come to make up their minds about the future - both for themselves and for the United Kingdom.

'Fifty years I fought for this,' said 83-year-old Isabelle Smith, a Yes supporter in Edinburgh's maritime district of Newhaven, a former fishing port. 'And we are going to win. I can feel it in my bones.'

The question on the ballot could not be simpler: 'Should Scotland be an independent country?'

Yet it has divided Scots during months of campaigning, generating an unprecedented volume and intensity of public debate and participation. The Yes side, in particular, has energized young people and previously disillusioned working-class voters.

Polls suggest the result was too close to call. A final Ipsos MORI poll released on Thursday put support for the No side at 53 percent and Yes at 47 percent. The phone survey of 991 people has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.

Many questions - the currency an independent Scotland would use, its status within the 28-nation European Union and NATO, the fate of Britain's nuclear-armed submarines, based at a Scottish port - remain uncertain or disputed after months of campaigning.

One thing was known: A Yes vote would trigger 18 months of negotiations between Scottish leaders and London-based politicians on how the two countries would separate their institutions before Scotland's planned Independence Day on March 24, 2016.

For Smith, who went to the polling station decked out in a blue-and-white pro-independence shirt and rosette, statehood for Scotland was a dream nurtured during three decades living in the U.S. with her late husband.

'The one thing America has that the Scots don't have is confidence,' said Smith, who returned to Scotland years ago. 'But they're getting it, they're walking tall.'

Cheers: After polls closed, some No campaigners said they were confident they had swayed enough undecided voters to stave off independence

After polls closed, some No campaigners said they were confident they had swayed enough undecided voters to stave off independence. They may have been helped by a last-minute offer from Britain's main political parties for more powers for Scotland if they reject secession.

Yes campaigners insisted Scots would not allow a return to the status quo, even if the independence bid failed.

'Whatever happens, Scotland is going to be different,' said Luke Campbell, a member of the Radical Independence Movement. 'People aren't going to go back to their sofas after this.'

After weeks in which the British media talked of little else, the television airwaves were almost a referendum-free zone Thursday due to electoral rules. On the streets, it was a different story, with rival Yes and No billboards and campaigners outside many polling places.

At one Edinburgh polling station, Thomas Roberts said he had voted Yes because he felt optimistic about Scotland's future as an independent country. He was looking forward to learning the outcome from the warm confines of a pub.

'Why not roll the dice for once?' he asked. 'I'm going to sit with a beer in my hand watching the results coming in.'

But some No supporters said the pro-independence campaign had fueled bad feeling among neighbors.

'The country is divided with a hatchet. It's so awful - and it was completely unnecessary,' said Fiona Mitchell, distributing No leaflets outside a polling station.

If the Yes side prevails, First Minister Alex Salmond will have realized a long-held dream of leading his country to independence from an alliance with England that was formed in 1707.

'This is our opportunity of a lifetime and we must seize it with both hands,' Salmond said in his final pre-vote speech.

Anti-independence leaders, including former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, himself a Scot, have implored Scots not to break their links with the rest of the United Kingdom and have stressed the economic uncertainties that independence would bring.

There have been fierce disputes over whether an independent Scotland could use the pound and several companies have said they would move their headquarters from Scotland to England if the Yes vote prevails.

Many Yes supporters were heading to symbolic spots like Calton Hill overlooking Edinburgh - hoping the sun would rise Friday on a new dawn of independence and not just a hangover.

But financial consultant Michael MacPhee, a No voter, said he would observe the returns coming in 'with anxiety.'

Scottish independence is 'the daftest idea I've ever heard,' he said.
