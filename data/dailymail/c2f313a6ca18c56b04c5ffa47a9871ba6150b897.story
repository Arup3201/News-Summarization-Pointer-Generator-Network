Two bosses of furniture giant Ikea have been quizzed by police over claims that managers spied on 'awkward customers' and 'suspicious staff' at its stores in France.

Ikea France's chief executive Stefan Vanoverbeke and chief financial officer Dariusz Rychert were formally detained by police in Versailles on Monday morning.

The questioning was expected to last until late Monday, a police source told French news agency AFP.

The probe is linked to claims last year that the Swedish company carried out criminal records checks and links to political groups on more than 200 people.

The scandal erupted after an Ikea insider leaked emails to a newspaper in March 2012 showing the firm had paid private detectives to pilfer reports from the national French police database.

Police then swooped on the firm's French HQ in Versailles last month and seized computers and documents.

France's Canard Enchaine newspaper said at the time: 'Questions were asked about more than 200 people, including requests for criminal records, vehicle registration checks and affiliations with political organisations.

'Ikea's head of security authorised payments of 80 euros for each check carried out.

'The information was then used in deciding whether to fire certain staff members or provide intellgence on awkward customers involved in legal disputes with them.'

Ikea began its own internal inquiry and fired four executives earlier this year following the allegations.

A company spokesman said in a statement when the claims first emerged: 'There have unfortunately within the IKEA group existed work practices that are contrary to the company's values and ethical standards.

'As a result of this, a former national manager, a former human resources manager, a former chief financial officer and the current head of security will leave their positions and the IKEA group.'

It is not the first time the company has been criticised over its security methods.

A 2010 book called The Truth About IKEA claimed the company was 'racism and nepotistic' and said its surveillance methods on staff were 'worthy of the Stasi'.
