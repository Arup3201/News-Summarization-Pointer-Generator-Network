Rosemary Shearman was murdered by a stranger in a blue pinstriped suit who tricked his way into her home

A grandmother was murdered by a stranger in a blue pinstriped suit who tricked his way into her home as she prepared to go on a Saga cruise.

Rosemary Shearman, 72, was waiting for a taxi to take her  to the airport when a man knocked on her front door.

The widow is thought to have let him into her £500,000 detached house in a suburban street in Hornchurch, Essex, on Tuesday morning.

He then killed her before using a weapon to injure himself, police believe.

The taxi driver who was booked to collect her alerted neighbours when there was no answer at  her door.

Last night one report claimed she was found with her hands and mouth bound with tape.

Footage captured on a neighbour’s CCTV system shows Mrs Shearman pulling into her drive at around 10.30am.

Moments later the camera  captures a man in a suit walking past and then following her into her house.

One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘Rosemary  had come home in her car.

Then just a few moments later a man in a dark suit appeared, just looking at the house.

‘He disappeared back up the street for a bit but then two  minutes later appeared back in shot, walking with real purpose towards the house.

‘He was carrying a big carrier bag which the police found in the house, but I don’t know what was  in it.

‘Then a couple of hours later the police arrived, there was some shouting, and we saw the same man in  the blue suit being carried out to the ambulance. We had never seen  him before.

‘It’s very strange, you don’t often see people hanging around in suits. Maybe he was just an opportunist. He may have seen her arrive back and saw the door open.’

The widow is thought to have let him into her house in Hornchurch, Essex, before he killed her

The man then used a weapon to injure himself, police believe and he was then seen leaving her home

Another neighbour added: ‘It is a 
horrific thing to happen to an old lady who lived by herself. She was 
lovely, a real character, and it is horrible what someone has done.’

Detectives
arrested the man, aged 50, at the scene. He was taken to hospital for 
treatment for his injuries, where his condition is said to be stable.

Detective
Chief Inspector Noel McHugh, who is leading the investigation, said: 
‘At this early stage there is nothing to suggest a relationship between 
the man we have arrested and the deceased.

‘That will form part of our investigation.’

Mrs Shearman had moved into the house with her husband Albert in 1979. Mr Shearman, a company director, died five years ago.

The
murder victim was a constant fixture at a weekly social group in her 
area and would take frequent trips with friends to the coast or abroad.

A 50-year-old man has been arrested before being taken to an east London hospital with unspecified injuries which police say appeared to be 'self-inflicted'

Flowers left near the scene where a Mrs Shearman was found dead at her home

On the day she was killed she was preparing to travel to the Canary 
Islands for a cruise.

Charlotte
Fitch Murphy, who runs the Ardleigh House Community Association where 
Mrs Shearman was a regular, said: ‘Rosemary was a real giggle.

She would
come to all our events, would pop in to the centre several times a week
and would go on every trip going.

‘She
loved sports, would play bowls and tennis and table tennis, and would 
make sure she had her tickets for Wimbledon every year.

‘Just
last Wednesday we went to Brighton for the day and we had a real laugh –
we saw people sunbathing nude on the beach and she thought it was a 
hoot.

‘We also went to 
Eastbourne for four days in June and to Whitstable for a day in July. 
And she had already paid the deposit for a trip to Turkey in December.’

However Ms Murphy said her friend was at times too trusting and her memory was going.

‘She would talk to anyone who asked her the time of day, so it would have been very easy to take advantage of that.

‘Sometimes
I would drop her off at home and she would stand outside in the dark 
and wave goodbye – I would have to nag her to get back inside rather 
than stand outside in the dark.’

Mrs Shearman leaves behind a son, who runs a catering business in Wales, and a daughter who lives in Hong Kong.
