Owen Farrell is happy to concede centre stage to George Ford when the former school friends start their first England match together in Saturday's QBE International against Samoa.

Ford, the Aviva Premiership's form fly-half, has been told 'you're the boss, so get bossing' by Stuart Lancaster as the head coach seeks to address the lack of tried and tested depth in the position.

As Lancaster's first-choice 10 for most of his reign, Farrell has become accustomed to the role of team general and the vocal 23-year-old is at ease with the responsibility of giving orders.

But against the big-hitting Pacific Islanders he must play second fiddle at inside centre, taking directions from Ford and relinquishing the goalkicking duties he treasures.

'It's George's first start so it's good for him to have the whole responsibility. I know he'll be brilliant,' Farrell said.

'He'll love it and it's good that he's going into the game with the whole package. I agree with what's happening. I'll concentrate on my job, which is helping him out.

Farrell will partner his Saracens team-mate Brad Barritt in the centre against the hard-tackling Samoans

2014

Ford made senior debut off the bench at Twickenham as a replacement for Farrell against Wales in the Six Nations.

'I like the responsibility of goalkicking, but I'll not be too down-heartened about not doing it because I have a job to concentrate on.' 

Despite his competitive nature, Farrell does not resent losing his cherished fly-half jersey to his former England age grade team-mate.

'I'm chuffed to be playing. I didn't for one second think that even if things were going brilliantly and we were winning every game that I was going to start every game from now until whenever,' Farrell said.

'I've never been that naive to think I'd play every game. This is a chance to try something different.' 

Lancaster has been longing for the chance to start Ford and Farrell as twin playmakers, a partnership that has only been seen briefly during the Bath 21-year-old's previous appearances as a replacement.

But the selection has drawn criticism with Lancaster forced to deny Farrell is 'undroppable' in response to his poor performances in the three-point defeats by New Zealand and South Africa.

Former England scrum-halves Austin Healey and Matt Dawson have also questioned the logic of picking a fly-half like Ford, who stands flat and attacks the line, only to then deploy a limited offensive midfield outside him in Farrell and Brad Barritt.

The head coach referenced Mike Catt's occasional presence alongside Jonny Wilkinson in the 2003 World Cup-winning team in explaining the need to develop the option of having two fly-halves in the backline and Farrell gives his view on how his partnership with Ford will work.

'I'm not an out-and-out classic centre. What we will try to do is get some organisation to hopefully give a couple of options. I'll obviously be playing one pass out, but I'll still be playing the same way,' Farrell said.

'I don't think I'll pipe down, it'll be a different way of talking, more about feeding information in.

'It will be more about giving George options and there will be times where I'm sure we'll swap around. We can afford to interchange like that.'
