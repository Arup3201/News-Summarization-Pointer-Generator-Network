The wife of a man who flew from Britain to Iraq to fight against ISIS militants has pleaded for him to come home.

British Kurd Waleed Sulaiman, 36, travelled 3,500 miles to the war-torn country from his home in Coventry in April this year.

He originally told his wife, Barbara, 44, that he was going to help his father cross from northern Iraq into Turkey for medical help.

The Muslim shopkeeper promised her he would be back within a fortnight but instead stayed on to battle against ISIS terrorists on the front line.

Barbara and Waleed Sulaiman, pictured celebrating on New Year's Eve in 2009, have not seen each other since he flew to Iraq to fight against ISIS

Bridget-Rojin, six, is old enough to understand her father is at war and has told her mother and father that she wants him to come

Mr Sulaiman later sent a message on the internet app Viber which said: 'I'm with the Peshmerga in northern Iraq. I'm up in the mountains with them, helping to load their weapons.'

Terrified Mrs Sulaiman then spent five agonising months not knowing if her husband was dead or alive, before he finally made contact with her at the end of September.

He promised he would be reunited with her and their six-year-old daughter, Bridget-Rojin, soon.

But today Mrs Sulaiman said she hadn't heard from her husband since that brief conversation and now spends every day worrying whether he will make it home.

She said: 'He was going over to see his dad and was going to take him to get medical treatment. He said he would be there for two weeks.

'Back in April, the only brief message I had was that he was loading weapons and taking water up to the refugees in the hills.

'After seeing the news I was terrified. I didn't know if he was dead or alive.

'When I finally got in touch with him it was worse if anything because he was telling me that he was helping the Peshmerga and that made me worry more.

The Muslim shopkeeper has only been in touch with her husband twice since he left to fight against ISIS

'I spoke to him at the end of September on the internet and he said everything was going really bad and he planned on coming back as soon as he can.

'I've spent months hoping and praying my husband comes home. Every day I've tried to get in touch. I'd ring his mobile but there was no answer.

'The mobile signal over there is ludicrous and when they are bombing all the time it doesn't help.

'Waleed told me it makes him cry with what is happening to innocent people. We just want him to come home safe to his family.'

The couple met in Daventry, Northamptonshire, nine years ago and got married in Jordan in 2007.

Barbara, who cannot work because of debilitating osteoarthritis, said Bridget-Rojin is old enough to realise her father is fighting in a deadly war.

She added: 'It is getting very bad there, but ISIS has not managed to enter Duhok.

'There are thousands of refugees that have lost everything and he is trying to help. He is very kind-hearted. He told me he was taking water up the mountains to help the refugees.

'Before he went, Waleed was always talking about people like Islamic State, saying they were giving the Muslim community a bad name. He is fed-up with Muslims getting a bad name, he thinks IS are disgusting.

'I'm constantly worried about him but I have to put on a brave face for my little one.

'She knows what's going on and when we messaged him in September she said "can you come home, I don't like all the shooting".

'He is very loyal to his country but we both love him and miss him very much.'

British soldiers have recently returned to Iraq to train Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in using heavy weapons against ISIS insurgents.
