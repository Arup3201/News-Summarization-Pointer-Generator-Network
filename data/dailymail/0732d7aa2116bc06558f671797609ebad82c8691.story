A three-year-old boy who died earlier this week after being left in a car for three hours in extreme desert heat is seen smiling and happy in recently released photos taken before his tragic death.

Hayden Nelson died on Sunday afternoon after a family friend, Courtney Arnold, reportedly forgot the child in her car in the parking lot of Abundant Life Church in Phoenix, Arizona.

Arnold was at choir practice at the time with Nelson's mother, Tiffani Nelson.

Gone to soon: the boy died of heatstroke as temperatures outside soared to 100 degrees

According to authorities, little Hayden, his mother and his eight-year-old sister had spent the previous evening staying at Arnold's house along with her five-year-old son.

Arnold drove everyone to practice that morning as Ms. Nelson needed to arrive early.

Prosecutors are still deciding whether or not to press charges.

Now, the Nelson family is sharing photos of their smiling boy, and trying to raise $5,000 for his funeral expenses and medical bills.

'Hayden Nelson, only three years old, was extremely loving and affectionate kid who loved God. He loved to sing, dance, praise and worship,' says the page on GiveForward.

'He loved going to church and was always happy and smiling. 

He gave the best hugs and can brighten the day of all who loves him by just being in their presence.'

According to reports, Hayden did not exit the car with the other children, and no one realized at the time.

By the time they returned to the car to find him at 2 pm, it was too late and the boy had died of heatstroke as temperatures in the area reached 100 degrees.

He wasn't breathing when he was discovered police told The Arizona Republic.
