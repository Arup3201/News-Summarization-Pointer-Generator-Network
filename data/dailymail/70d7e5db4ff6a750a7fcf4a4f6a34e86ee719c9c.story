A Florida teenager has died after smoking a synthetic drug known as Spice - and now his family are fighting to raise awareness of the dangerous concoction and have authorities acknowledge it caused his and many other deaths.

Kurtis Hildreth, 18, moved to Wasilla, Alaska to live with his aunt, Kerri Stevens, and work at her family's commercial glass shop after graduating high school.

But what was supposed to be a promising new start ended abruptly, when Stevens found him dead inside his room with a pipe filled with Spice and a lighter on the floor by his side.

However, the state medical examiner and Alaska State troopers won't acknowledge Spice caused the November 16 death of the otherwise healthy teen and have ruled it a mystery.

Tragic: Kurtis Hildreth, pictured died after smoking a synthetic drug known as Spice

New start: Kurtis Hildreth, 18, moved to Wasilla, Alaska to live with his aunt, Kerri Stevens, and work at her family's commercial glass shop after graduating high school. But the fresh start turned to tragedy

'Whatever hit him, (it) hit him hard and hit him fast,' Stevens told Alaska Dispatch. 'The pipe was right there by his feet. He was a healthy kid. The lighter was right there. The pipe was right there. He never had any kind of heart problems or seizures.'

Some of the partially burned 'Spice' was still in the pipe, but its chemical composition wasn't tested, the family say.

Spice, gaining popularity as a legal alternative to marijuana, is actually a mystery cocktail of chemicals made in China and shipped to the U.S. where it is sprayed on plant material and packaged as incense or potpourri.

It generally comes with a warning, 'not for human consumption,' however it is clearly positioned as a tool for getting high.

Stevens and the teen's mother, Kelli Farquer, are certain Spice killed Hildreth, a happy-go-lucky teen.

But the Alaska Medical Examiner's Office has listed his death as 'undetermined,' as in many other suspected cases, because an autopsy of Hildreth's body did not turn up any medical conditions.

A toxicity screening of his blood, bile and other body fluids did not show any signs of illegal drugs or alcohol, despite some 300 drugs being tested for, including outlawed combinations of Spice.

But Karen Dobner, founder of To the Maximus, a nonprofit anti-synthetic drug foundation, said the chemists change their formulas often, trying to dodge laws aimed at their product. In Alaska, packages of synthetic drugs have not tested positive for banned substances in months.

'It's not a marijuana alternative, and these newer chemicals have never been seen on earth before -- the kids are the lab rats,' Dobner said.

But Hildreth's family are determined that his death will not go unsolved, medically.

They've teamed up with Dobner, whose own son Max was killed in June 2011 after he smoked synthetic marijuana then ran his car into a house.

Synthetic drugs are still largely mysterious. The number of people killed by the cocktails each year is relatively unknown because most Spice-related deaths are listed as undetermined or as a result of something else.

In September, Colorado officials began investigating three possible Spice-related deaths. But there are hundreds of stories of both suspected and officially designated Spice-related deaths online.

'Currently only 22 of several hundred synthetic cannabinoids can be identified in blood fluids. They are actually looking for metabolites in blood, and it is a difficult and slow process to identify these chemicals,' Dobner told Alaska Dispatch.

In Hildreth's case, the drugs themselves were not tested to determine their composition.

Testing for the exact chemical composition in synthetic drugs can be tricky but it's not impossible.

While synthetic drugs are metabolized by the body, they can be identified in the drug itself, which is the test Dobner and Hildreth's family want carried out.

Farquer said the troopers told her they could not submit the drugs to the lab because there appeared to be no criminal intent in Hildreth's death. The mother is hiring a private attorney to get the drugs to the lab for testing.

'I know Spice killed my son,' Farquer told the news website.

Meanwhile, the Municipality of Anchorage wants to get the drugs off the shelves, and is considering a new law that will outlaw possession and sale of Spice, not because of the chemical makeup but because of deceptive marketing.

The drugs are sold in Alaska at local smoke and head shops, usually packaged with a cartoonish character and a name such as 'Dead Man' and 'Mr. Nice Guy.'

'They market this crap to 12-year-olds. It has Scooby-Doo on the front of it, smiley faces, SpongeBob -- I mean, that's who its being marketed to. It's horrible,' Stevens said.
