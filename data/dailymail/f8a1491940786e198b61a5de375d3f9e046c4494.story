George Osborne promised to prioritise tax cuts for middle earners yesterday as the economic recovery delivered the biggest boost to the public coffers since before the financial crisis.

The Government recorded a surplus of £8.8billion in January – the largest for seven years – after a flood of tax payments.

The boost rounded off a week of economic good news for the UK, in which inflation fell to its lowest level for 55 years, while the number of people in work reached a record high.

Pay growth easily outstripped inflation for the fourth consecutive month in December, ending the squeeze on household incomes. Total average weekly earnings were 2.1 per cent higher than a year earlier, up from 1.7 per cent last month. The stock market has risen to a 16-year high and is on the verge of overhauling its previous peak, reached in 1999.

Speaking yesterday as he visited London Underground workers upgrading the Tube network, the Chancellor said the figures vindicated the Coalition’s decisions on tax and spending, including the cutting the top rate of tax from 50p to 45p, which ‘sent a signal’ that Britain backed enterprise.

And he vowed that further tax cuts, offering relief for those paying the 40p higher rate, and a new income tax threshold of £12,500 would be his ‘priority’ if the Conservatives remain in power. ‘I took a difficult decision to cut the 50p rate,’ he said. ‘That rate sent a message that Britain was an uncompetitive place to do business.

‘Today… the tax receipts show that actually, by reducing it to 45p we have not lost revenue.’

Britain’s highest earners now pay more than a quarter of the entire income tax bill, more than when the Coalition came to power. Nearly 300,000 taxpayers are forecast to contribute the equivalent of £45.9billion by the end of this year.

The windfall puts the Chancellor on course to hit his borrowing targets for the year, and could even give him some room for pre-election giveaways in next month’s Budget.

The Office for National Statistics figures showed Mr Osborne looks set to hit his target of reducing the annual deficit – which hit a record £153billion or around ten per cent of national income under Labour – from £97.3billion last year to £91.3billion this year or 5 per cent.

Last month’s tax surplus was the biggest since 2008 and £2.3billion larger than in 2014. Self-assessment payments were strong because many high earners deferred bonuses from 2012-13 to take advantage of the cut in the 50p rate. 

Self-assessment receipts were £1.7billion higher at a record £12.3billion, corporation tax receipts were up £900million to £8.3billion and VAT rose by £200million to £10.6billion.

Samuel Tombs, analyst at Capital Economics, said: ‘The recovery is finally having a positive impact on the public purse.’

Labour’s treasury spokesman Chris Leslie said the figures were ‘distorted’ by delayed bonuses and vowed to put the top rate back up to 50p. He added: ‘Our plan will make sensible spending cuts.’

Council house tenants will be given taxpayer-funded grants of £30,000 help them buy a home. The Right to Buy Social Mobility Fund is aimed at freeing people ‘trapped in social housing’, the Government said, such as those who want to downsize. Some £84million will be made available over two years.
