A successful ice hockey goalie requires balance, speed, and cat-like reflexes.

So it was surprising to see keeper Roman Kaspar, 24, from Klasterce nad Ohri, in the Czech Republic, stumble out on to the ice after hitting the bar before the game.

Even more surprising is that his team, HC Klasterce, went on to win the match 8-5 against rivals Karlovy Vary.

Kaspar said: 'I remember drinking, and feeling pretty happy about the match, which we won I hasten to add, the next thing I knew we were doing the after the match photos.'

'Whatever happened in between is a blur, but I can't have been that bad because I saved a few goals.'

In it Kaspar can be seen leaning against his goal for balance, leaning forwards on his knees, and then falling over on to the ice.

Amazingly he also manages to save one shot on goal by virtually falling on the puck.
