A member of the Gucci fashion dynasty jailed for ordering the murder of her wealthy ex-husband has refused the offer of parole – because it would mean her having to get a job.

Patrizia Gucci, 62, dubbed the ‘Black Widow’, was jailed for 26 years in 1998 for arranging the death of her husband, Maurizio Gucci.

Well-known for her luxury lifestyle, she once said: ‘I’d rather cry in a Rolls than be happy on a bicycle.’

Victim: Maurizio Gucci was shot dead on the orders of his wife Patrizia as he walked into his office in Milan in 1995

After being offered parole, Patrizia told the board at San Vittore jail: 'No thanks as it would mean getting a job and I have never worked a day in my life.'

Patrizia, who is serving her sentence in the Milan jail, added: 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants.'

She also said she wanted to stay inside because she wanted to take care of her pet ferret.

Her decision does not come entirely as a surprise to those that know her as she once famously summed up her lavish luxury lifestyle which included apartments in Milan and St Moritz, by saying: 'I'd rather cry in a Rolls then by happy on a bicycle.'

Patrizia, 63, has been allowed out for the day to visit her elderly mother Silvana and her two daughters Allegra, 29, and Alessandra, 36, at the Milan flat where the family lived when her husband was still alive.

Her original trial heard how she had ordered the murder of her husband after he offered her $650,000 in a divorce settlement.

She
 described the offer as a 'plate of lentils', insisting she wanted at 
least $1 million, and when he refused she hired hitman Benedetto 
Ceraulo. Ceraulo was found guilty of pulling the trigger and given a life sentence.

The
 fashion empire of Gucci was founded in 1921 by Guccio Gucci, a 
Florentine leather merchant whose business of selling leather travel 
bags prospered after the Depression and World War Two.

Guccio's son Aldo expanded the 
business into Paris, New York and Tokyo as the 'twin Gs' of the family 
name became a worldwide fashion icon.

By 1974, the Gucci empire numbered 14 stores and 46 franchised boutiques around the world.

At around the same time, 
celebrities like Jackie Kennedy were helping establish Gucci as the 
world's leading fashion brand by embracing its products.

Maurizio Gucci, Guccio's grandson 
and Aldo's nephew, took control of the company from the board of 
directors after Aldo, who was sent to prison for tax evasion in 1986 
aged 81.

However, Maurizio would be the last member of the family to head the Gucci business.

By 1989, nearly 50 per cent of the 
business had been bought out by Investcorp, a group of investment 
bankers angling for shares of the business.

In 1993, Maurizio sold his holding for $170m to a Bahrain-based investment company.

Patrizia was furious after she discovered her husband had dumped her for a younger woman.

She was found guilty of ordering 46-year-old Maurizio's death after her clairvoyant and confidante Pina Auriemma turned informer and told police about the plot.

The trial captivated not only 
Italians but the world and Patrizia - who arrived in court in designer 
outfits every day - told the judge and jury of how she had been betrayed
 by Auriemma saying: 'Never let even a friendly world into the chicken 
coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry.'

Seven
 years ago her legal team tried to get the conviction overturned on the 
grounds of her ill health, saying she had been affected by a brain 
tumour - but the case fizzled out.

Today
 her lawyer Danilo Boungiorno said she had been offered work in a 
restaurant or gym, but had turned them both down and he added: 'She 
would prefer to stay in jail and make use of the weekend visits she is 
granted to see her family.'

The
 Gucci family was one of Italy's richest and most well known 'dynasty 
families', and their saga has even been turned into a TV series.

Four years ago there were plans for a film about the family with 
Angelina Jolie in the lead role, but the project never took off.

Maurizio Gucci was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company made famous with its double G logo.

In the early 1990s it was hit by problems and he sold the label for 
$120 million, just two years before his death, leaving his wife furious 
at his failure to invest the money properly.
