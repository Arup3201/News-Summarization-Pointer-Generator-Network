If you spend every single day in a zoo enclosure, you could be forgiven for wanting some privacy now and again.

But this extrovert otter still went out of his way to wow the crowds by juggling with a pebble.

He put on a show for visitors to the Sea Life Abenteuer Park in Oberhausen, Germany, to the delight of those around.

Scroll down for video

Talented: An otter at the Sea Life Abenteuer Park in Oberhausen, Germany, picks up a pebble to show off his juggling skills to visitors

Caught on camera: Footage of the otter juggling the pebble between its paws was uploaded to YouTube

What a catch: The otter had no problem repeatedly passing the pebble between its paws at a fast rate

After scrabbling about with the small
rock, he begins rolling it across his chest before he hits his stride 
and begins tossing it higher and higher.

But while his cute display may be amazing the humans, the otter laying right next to him barely seems to notice.

The
other creature, potentially the juggler's partner, looks lazily over 
out of one eye before deciding she has better ways to spend her time.

The performing scamp is part of a family of Asian short-claws otters that live in the park, which also has penguins, sea turtles, jellyfish, sharks and giant Japanese Spider Crabs.

'Look what I've found': The otter grabs a pebble and looks around before his performance

Ready...: The otter gets ready to launch the rock, to the bemusement of his partner

Asian short-clawed otters are the smallest species of otter in the world, and weigh only 5kg.

The furry animals live in water, but their fur is so thick that their bodies never actually get wet.

They are often tamed and used as pest control to rid rice paddies of crabs. The mammals can live for up to 16 years and stay faithful to their mate for life.

Otters have
many quirky habits, including banging rocks against clams and on their 
tummies to crack shells.

At night, sea otters hold hands with their mate while they sleep to stop them floating apart.

Great catch!: He starts to throw the pebble back and forth

Look at me!: Despite his trick, the otther next to him seems more interested in her own tail

"Otters are the cause of our declining water vole population. They just love to snack on furry things after eating all the eels" Newton , Bournemouth, United Kingdom, 21/9/2013 09:32... They're not the cause. Sure they will effect the voles, and certainly there are more otters around now - but voles decline where otters are not present too. The big reason for vole decline is damage to habitat and mink - not otters. There are a sight more voles than there are otters, and a damn sight more mink! The big reason for eel decline is HUMANS!

Devoted to their partners. And cute to boot. Bet we can learn something from them.

Reminds me of the movie called "Osaka the Otter.." so sad.. why British people wants to use hunting digs and rip these cute innocent animals into pieces while they are alive is beyond me.

....What rubbish!  Otters are very playful animals and I don't imagine they'd ever be bored for one minute as they're always up to mischief no matter where they live.
