One of Britain's cheapest homes is going under the hammer with a starting price of just £2,500.

Estate agents admit the one bedroom flat in Derby Street, Hartlepool is in a 'distressed' state, but claim the first floor apartment could make an ideal first home with a little TLC and lots of DIY.

Despite appearing to have issues with damp and tiny rooms, the property has still attracted plenty of interest, with 1,200 potential buyers viewing it on the internet.

The cheapest flat in Britain: This 
one bedroom flat on Derby Street in Hartlepool is to be sold at public auction next week with a £2500 starting price

Floor plan: The property consists of a small bedroom, lounge, kitchen and shower room as well as a tiny cupboard for storage

At £2,500, the flat is on sale at a fraction of the price of similar properties in Hartlepool. Auctioneers say it is the cheapest property they have ever seen in the town.

Lawrie Stewart, director of Auction House Tees Valley, who is handling the sale, said: 'This is the lowest I have seen in Hartlepool.

'I have seen prices start at around £1,000 in other parts of the North-East.

'It does need bringing up to a decent standard but it doesn't take much to turn it around.

Challenge: All of the rooms in the property are in a 'distressed' state and need work done on them

'Apart from its low starting price, its selling points are that it is close to the town and all amenities.

'There is a main road round the corner and it is handy for buses and public transport.

'We hope will go for a lot more than the guide price. We have had over 1,200 hits on the website.

'A lot of people buy them unseen, they see it on the internet and bid by telephone.'

Box bedroom: The tiny master bedroom doesn't have much space to play with

The flat in the Oxford Road area of town includes one bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom, all of which need improvement.

Mr Stewart said investors will be the likely buyers who will redecorate the flat before renting it out.

The average price of a house in Hartlepool is £74,702 while the national average in England and Wales stands at £162,080, according to the latest figures from the Land Registry.

Back to basics: The kitchen needs new units as well as a sink and other utilities

A one-bedroom flat in the West London borough of Ealing ranges from £84,000 to £410,000.

The flat in Derby Street will be sold at auction on February 20.

Last year, a home in Middlesbrough billed the cheapest in the country sold for £14,000.

The property in Lime Trees Close, in the run-down area of Port Clarence had a starting price of £750 but a late surge of interest saw the home sell for more than 18 times the guide price at £18,000.

Bargain: The flat's asking price is a fraction of the average £74,000 cost for a property in Hartlepool
