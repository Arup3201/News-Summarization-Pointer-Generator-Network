It is the eerie old church that featured in Bram Stoker’s gothic novel Dracula.

Now St Mary’s in Whitby has become the scene of real horror after human bones began to emerge from their  centuries-old graves.

The grisly discovery was made when the church cemetery, which dates to 1110AD, began to subside and fall down the cliff last month following heavy rain.

Grave danger: Human bones have crumbled off the side of the cliff where St Mary's Church, in Whitby, stands

Ruin: It is feared the legendary St Mary's Church in Whitby could fall if the cliff face crumbles away

Many of the ancient graves were 
exposed – and among the debris tumbling on to the buildings below were a
 number of human bones, thought to be at least a century old.

Stoker was inspired to use the 
cemetery – which has been closed to the public since 1865 – as the 
backdrop for some of Dracula’s horror scenes after visiting the North 
Yorkshire town in the 1890s.

Resident Barry Brown, 56, told how he found several bones in the backyard of his kipper smokehouse, which sits under the cliff.

He said: ‘When the subsidence began I 
went out and found a few pieces of bone. They’d been buried for God 
knows how many years because they were soft and yellow from being in the
 soil.

'I managed to identify one hip bone, two pieces of skull and a 
large bone that looked like it was part of a leg.

‘It’s quite sad picking that sort of thing up, I expect the people who buried them thought they’d be there for ever.

Debris: More cracks have appeared in the cliff face this week following heavy rainfall in Whitby

Problems: Reverend Canon David Smith said the church will have to use money earmarked for repairs to pay for the landslide recovery work

Historic: In 2000 St Mary's Church in Whitby experienced more landslides close to the edge of the graveyard

Iconic: St Mary's church featured in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula

Goths who flocked to the graveyard because of its links to Dracula were banned from the churchyard in 2011

‘It could have even been one of my 
relatives, as my family have been here since the early 1800s.’  The 
bones were collected soon afterwards by church staff and have since been
 reburied in a more stable spot.

It is not known who the bones belonged
 to, as many of the headstones in the cemetery have been moved around 
over the centuries. St Mary’s Reverend Canon David Smith said: ‘The 
cemetery has been closed for over a century, so if any graves are 
exposed it’s only bones. If anything is exposed we re-inter them.’

The landslide has been blamed on a 
drainage pipe which became damaged and fell away. This meant recent 
heavy rainfall saturated the soil, which then began to fall.

Rev Smith added: ‘The church has been 
trying to muck in to get things done and we have had a civil engineer 
working to sort it out.

‘They’ve been trying to find where the water was coming from and making the cliff edge more secure.’

As
 Bram Stoker sat at his desk overlooking the seaside town of Whitby Bay 
in 1890 he noticed the huge number of bats flying around St Mary's 
Church. 

Perched on top of a cliff St Mary's, with its rows upon rows of tombstones, looked out onto the stormy North Sea.

It
 was the atmospheric surroundings of Whitby and St Mary's Church which 
would inspire him to write the classic Gothic novel Dracula published in
 1897.

The writer happened to be staying in the town trying to decide whether it would be suitable for a family holiday.

However, it became the perfect backdrop for his book.

He wrote: 'For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church.

'Then
 as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the Abbey coming into 
view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut 
moved along, the church and churchyard became gradually visible...

'It
 seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the 
white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast,
 I could not tell.'

Stoker's
 Dracula is shipwrecked off the Yorkshire coast. He comes ashore in the 
guise of a black dog and wreaks havoc on the town.

Prince
 Vlad the Impaler, from Transylvania and known for his bloodthirsty 
reputation, is thought to have been the inspiration for Stoker's 
character Dracula.

One of the characters, Mina, keeps a journal containing detailed descriptions of Whitby and those areas frequented by Dracula.

A spokesman for Scarborough Borough 
Council said: ‘The cliff is not the responsibility of the council 
because it is private land and there is no immediate danger to life or 
property.  ‘We have written to the church and have made them aware of 
their obligations as landowners.’

Dracula, published in 1897, tells the 
story of the vampire Count’s attempt to relocate from Transylvania to 
England, leaving a trail of dead in his wake, with his ship running 
aground in Whitby in a storm.

Stoker hit upon the idea of the count 
while reading a history book at Whitby library, and made St Mary’s part 
of the story after being struck by the way the bats circled the 
building. In one scene, the Count appears in the church cemetery with 
his young victim Lucy Westenra.

Many visitors to Whitby still ask about Dracula’s grave, forgetting he is a work of fiction.
