It was a touching gesture designed to bring about something positive from a friend’s death.

When Ozan Yunus, 28, died of meningitis shortly before he was due to fly to Spain for a stag party, his best friend Daniel Pallace asked easyJet for a refund on the ticket so he could donate it to charity.

But instead of receiving a compassionate response, he said he was bullied by the airline into handing over a death certificate from the family to prove Mr Yunus was dead.

In the meantime, easyJet put the seat back up for sale.

Mr Pallace, a trainee pilot, accused the airline of ‘grave-robbing’ and said: ‘What really shocked me was how easyJet cancelled the reservation but made it available online, so they made money on the seat without refunding us.

‘How can they say we haven’t done enough to get the refund when they’ve already put it back up for sale?’

Mr Yunus, known as Oz, had booked the flight to Barcelona with Mr Pallace to attend another friend’s stag party.

'Bullied': Mr Pallace asked easyJet for a refund on his friend's ticket so he could donate it to a meningitis charity. In response, he claims he was bullied into handing over a death certificate to prove Mr Yunus was dead

The pair – both Londoners who met at Leeds University in 2005 – had paid a total of £108.98 for their two seats. 

But Mr Yunus, who worked as a primary school teacher in Sidcup, Kent, fell ill with meningitis on Christmas Day.

Doctors later told his family he was effectively brain dead. And on December 30, his  parents Sandra, 53, and Ojal, 63, decided to switch off his life- support machine.

Mr Pallace contacted easyJet and tried to claim a refund to donate to Meningitis Now – but was told this would require proof of death from his dead friend’s family.

Making money: Meanwhile, the airline put Mr Yunus's ticket back up for sale online - for £91.99 (file picture)

Hours later, he went online and saw the seat was back on sale for £91.99. 

The 26-year-old told of his frustration at the bureaucracy he encountered.

‘I contacted his sister Yasemin to forward the death certificate to me so I could give it to them,’ he said.

‘This still wasn’t good enough for them, and even when Yasemin forwarded it herself they wanted more documentation. I can’t believe a death certificate from the sister of the man who has died isn’t enough paperwork for them.’

Miss Yunus, 23, said: ‘They were 
completely insensitive and bombarded me with emails. In the end I had to
 ask them to show a bit of compassion and stop asking me to prove my 
brother was dead.’

Eventually, easyJet did provide a refund. 

At the teacher’s funeral, the school head gave a speech about his impact on the profession and his hearse drove past his school so the children could say a final goodbye. 

An easyJet spokesman said: ‘The correct action was taken to protect the personal data in relation to this booking.

'Unfortunately that means the refund could not be issued until security screening had been passed and permission had been given by an immediate family member.

‘We would like to apologise for any inconvenience experienced at an already difficult time.’
