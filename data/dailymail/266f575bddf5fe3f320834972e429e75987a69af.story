A bride who claimed that the cliff-fall death of her husband of just eight days was an accident was charged with murder by a grand jury on Thursday.

Jordan Linn Graham will today make a plea to magistrates in a Missoula court against charges of first and second-degree murder and making false statements in the death of Cody L Johnson.

In a rage, Graham is said to have pushed Mr Johnson, 25, with both hands in his back, sending him tumbling hundreds of feet over a sheer cliff edge at Glacier National Park in Montana, US.

Happier times: Jordan and Cody Johnson got married eight days before she allegedly pushed him to his death

The area is so rugged a helicopter had to be used to recover the body.

It emerged recently that a singer 
created a custom song for the newlywed couple with lyrics about falling 
and climbing up hills that seem spooky to her in light of the court case.

Graham, 22, has
been under house arrest and fitted with a GPS monitoring bracelet 
while staying at her parents' Kalispell, Montana home.

The revelations about the seemingly prophetic song adds another layer of intrigue to the case, as the woman who wrote the song said that she came up with the lyrics based on a series of interviews with the couple before their wedding.

'I used words like "you helped me to climb higher for a better view, you're my safe place to fall, you never let me go,"' songwriter Elizabeth Shea told CNN.

'Now when I hear those words, it's a little creepy.'

Influence: The songwriter says that she interviewed the couple and met with Jordan before coming up with the lyrics, that now seem eerily prophetic in light of the way how Cody died

Authorities say Graham has admitted to shoving Cody Lee Johnson, 25, off a cliff in Glacier on the night of July 7 during an argument.

According to charging documents Graham had been having second thoughts about getting married around the time the body of her husband was discovered.

Prosecutors revealed that an email was allegedly sent from a man named 'Tony' while Graham's husband was still missing.

The email, sent three days after Cody Lee Johnson went missing, claimed he had fallen and died after going hiking with three friends.

According to the affidavit, the message also suggested 'the search should be called off', according to the Missoulian.

Family friend Tracey Maness told the Missoulian that Johnson was excited about his wedding and in love with Graham

However, the email was traced to a 
computer belonging to Graham's stepfather Steven Rutledge, and it was found 
to have been written on the day the gmail account it was sent from was 
created, FBI Special Agent Steven Liss said. She made her confession to 
police only after this email had been sent.

Her
25-year-old husband died on July 7 and Graham allegedly confessed to 
pushing him on July 16, but she wasn't arrested on second-degree murder 
charges until Monday.

When 
she interviewed by the police on July 18, Graham admitted that she had 
lied about the death of her husband and provided false statements, 
according to ABC News.

Graham posted this photo around the time of Cody Johnson's death. She said she was doing some 'modeling' after a night of bowling

Graham posted this photo to Instagram in December 2012 with the caption: 'He proposed!! Best early Christmas present ever!! :)'
