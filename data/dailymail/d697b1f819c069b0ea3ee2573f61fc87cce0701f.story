This image created by Dr Waldron predicts how Prince George could look like as a teenager

It wasn't too long after the Duchess of Cambridge announced she was pregnant that artists and forensic experts began coming up with their own impressions of how the world's most eagerly anticipated baby may look.

But now Prince George Alexander Louis has been born, one expert has helped to create a computer image of how she thinks the young Royal will look as a teenager. 

The handsome adolescent has mousy blond hair, strong eyebrows, his mum's nose and eyes and his dad's mouth and chin. 

The image was produced by Dr D'Lynn Waldron, a portrait artist and photographer from the U.S., who said she took into account 'genetics, lifestyle, personality and environment.'

Dr Waldron has previously produced portraits of Princess Diana, Marilyn Monroe, Shiloh Jolie Pitt and Suri Cruise.

'My age-progressed and age-regressed portraits are digitally painted artwork forensically based on all available source materials, including genetics, lifestyle, medical history, personality, environment, and how gravity effects their type of face', said Dr Waldron.

'My portraits do not predict the future, but only show what it might be in certain circumstances. '

It was revealed yesterday that the Duchess of Cambridge spent 11 hours in labour.

Kate had a completely natural birth after arriving at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, just after 5.30am last Monday.

A teenager from Stepney Green, East London, has spoken about his links to the Prince - sharing his name.

George Alexander Louie Hubbard, 19, from Stepney Green, East London, said he hoped his Royal name would help him 'get into more places'.
