Carrying a phone in your pocket all day may seem harmless, but there's a growing body of evidence linking devices to impotence, infertility and low sperm count.

Concerned about the health of his 'little swimmers', a physician from London created a range of underwear fitted with silver 'cages' to protect them from radiation.

The mesh of silver is woven into the fabric of the pants and shields the wearer from electromagnetic rays from phones, tablets and other devices - creating a so-called Faraday cage.

The cotton in Wireless Armour underwear, pictured, is woven with a mesh of silver that shields wearers from electromagnetic radiation. It creates what's called a Faraday cage that uses conductive materials to block electromagnetic energy. This radiation is produced by phones, tablets, laptops and other electronic devices

Faraday cages, named after inventor Michael Faraday, are used to protect electronics from interference.

They are made using meshes of conductive material.

These block external static and non-static electric fields.

For example, systems in parliament, banks and stock market servers are protected by the technology.

In the Wireless Armour underwear range, thin threads of silver are woven in with the cotton during the production stage.

Wireless’ Armour’s Faraday cage fabric has been independently tested and was found to shield 99.97 per cent of Wi-Fi.

In the Wireless Armour range, thin threads of silver are woven in with cotton during the production stage.

This strengthens the underwear, but also makes them antimicrobial, protecting them from bacteria and keeping them smelling fresh. 

Each pair has approximately 20 per cent silver woven into the fabric.

Wireless Armour underpants are available in two styles - tight-fitting Boxer Briefs or loose Trunks. 

There
 are then two versions of each - either a 360 model which protects from 
radiation in the front and back pockets, or an 180 model that only 
provides protection on the front of the body.

Physics
 graduate and CEO Joseph Perkins, 26, has now launched an Indiegogo 
campaign to fund production of his underwear range, and expects products
 to go on sale by July this year.

The pants are expected to retail for £35 ($58), but campaign backers can get a pair for £14 ($23).

Perkins is looking to raise £30,000 ($50,000) and has so far achieved just short of £400 ($672).

The campaign runs until 28 May and has been verified by Indiegogo as a genuine product.

Perkins said: ‘Wireless Armour is designed to protect the health of a wireless generation glued to their mobile devices. 

Men who use mobile phones could be risking their fertility, according to two separate studies from Cleveland and Egypt.

Both studies found a 'worrying link' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone.

In
 the Cleveland study, men who made calls on a mobile phone for more than
 four hours a day had the worst sperm counts and the poorest quality 
sperm.

The Egypt research noticed the correlation after six hours of phone use a day.

However, neither study found sperm count was affected.

Doctors believe the damage could be caused by the electromagnetic radiation emitted by handsets or the heat they generate.

Previous
 studies found using a laptop has a similar impact on fertility levels 
in men, due to the heat released from the battery.

Elsewhere, the heat of kitchens has been linked to low fertility levels in some chefs.

'We are exposing ourselves to unprecedented levels of electromagnetic radiation and this is showing with our declining sperm counts and increasing cases of cancer.

‘Although the evidence is not conclusive it is piling up. Our goal is to make protection as easy as getting dressed!’

Last month, scientists found men who hold their mobiles for more than four hours a day are more likely to suffer from impotence than those who limit usage to less than two hours.

For the study, researchers recruited 20 men who had experienced problems with erectile function in the six months prior to the study.

They also studied 10 healthy men with no history of dysfunction.

The men who had previously suffered from erectile problems were found to carry their devices for a ‘significantly longer time’ than the healthy men - 4.4 hours a day compared to 1.8 hours a day.

This backed up the findings of two other, separate studies in Egypt and the U.S. from last year.

Both studies found a 'worrying link' between poor sperm and the number of hours a day a man uses his mobile phone.

However, all the researchers said more needs to be done to establish what causes the problem and the extent of damage mobiles can cause.
