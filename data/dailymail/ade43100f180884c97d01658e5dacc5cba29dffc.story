Joan claims her life has been ruined ever since she received a police caution for 'child cruelty' in 2006

A mother given a criminal record for leaving her six-year-old son home alone for 45 minutes has told how it has ‘destroyed’ her reputation and career.

She was given a police caution for ‘child cruelty’ when she left her son at home while she had a driving lesson in 2006.

Eight years on she is battling to have it removed from her records, saying it has left her feeling ‘ostracised’ and like a ‘hardened criminal’.

As a result of this case and others, the Government is being pressed to issue clear guidelines on what age and for how long children can be left alone.

The divorced mother of two, who wants to be known only as Joan, is a support worker for vulnerable adults. She does not want her surname disclosed for fear it will affect her future employment. ‘I am a hard-working and loving mum who made a mistake,’ she said. ‘I would never have left my son alone if he wasn’t 100 per cent safe and secure.’

She left her little boy at home ‘as a last resort’ on a school inset day when she could not find childcare, locking kitchen and bedroom doors and leaving him in front of the television with snacks and a drink.

‘I asked him if he was OK and that Mummy wouldn’t be long,’ she said. ‘No danger could have come to him.’

But while she was away he answered the phone to his sister’s school nurse, who was calling to arrange vaccinations.

She asked him where his mother was and other questions, before he burst into tears. The nurse called police and by the time Joan returned, three policemen were at her doorstep, attempting to force the door open.

She said: ‘He was confused because he had a lady asking him questions he couldn’t answer. They searched my house for drugs and alcohol. I was treated like a hardened criminal.’ Joan, who is divorced and lives with her children in East Birmingham, was advised by a lawyer to accept a caution to avoid going to court and reassured it would remain on her records for only five years.

Eight years on, her records still state she was cautioned for ‘an act of cruelty to a child or young person’, under the Children Act 1993. She is forced to declare this in Disclosure and Barring Service checks, formerly known as CRB checks, for her work. ‘It is hugely humiliating,’ she said.

Her son is now 14, head boy of his school and in trials for Premier League football teams.

‘She doesn’t deserve how she’s been treated, she’s a great mum and she’s always been there for me,’ he said last night.

Joan said she was forced to leave her son at home as it was a school inset day and she had a driving lesson

Joan has won a place at university to study mental health nursing but was turned down by two institutions due to the caution. ‘My image is tarnished,’ she said. ‘It is something I relive every day of my life. It was the first and last time I left him alone and something I regret.’

The case has sparked fierce debate, with some parents horrified by her treatment while others warn that young children should never be left alone.

John Hemming, Lib Dem MP for Birmingham Yardley, who is helping Joan with her case, has tabled a parliamentary question asking for clearer guidelines, adding: ‘While certain things may not be a very good idea, they shouldn’t be criminal.’

West Midlands Police said a caution is disclosable for five years however some offences are disclosable indefinitely.
