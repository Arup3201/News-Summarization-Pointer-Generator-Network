A firm which supplied ducks for Gordon Ramsay's foie gras dishes appeared in court in France today accused of 'serious animal cruelty'.

Ernest Soulard, which is based in Oie, in the west of the country, is said to have kept birds in appalling conditions as it created the delicacy.

If they become the first ever foie gras producer to be found guilty of animal cruelty, senior executives face prison sentences and fines of up to Â£25,000.

Videos offered as evidence in the high profile trial in La Roche-sur-Yon, in the Vendee region, show ducks lying dead and dying in the same cage.

Many have chronic eye injuries and abscesses, and all are force-fed grain through a tube to make their livers 10 times the normal size.

This happened during a two-week ordeal in a windowless shed before they were slaughtered, and used to make foie gras.

On hearing of prosecution in 2013, Ramsay cancelled all purchases from Ernest Soulard, pending 'further investigations'.

Ernest Soulard also sold ducks to some of the best restaurants and hotels in Paris, including Alain Ducasse's Jules Verne, on the Eiffel Tower, Le Meurice, Georges V, and Fouquet's, on the Champs Elysee.

In one particularly disturbing scene in the video, an exhausted and clearly distressed duck can be seen lying on its back with its tongue hanging from its beak.

The practice of enlarging livers by injecting food directly into the gut is known as 'gavage' in France, and animal rights campaigners want to see this legal process used as a test case to get the practice banned.

An organisation called L214 initiated the case - the first in which a major foie gras producer has gone of trial for cruelty.

'It's the first time gavage has gone on trial,' said L214 in a statement, adding that the case would allow 'a wide-ranging discussion' about gavage and 'the consequences it can have on the animal.'

'If the company is convicted, it will obviously affect the practice of gavage which is banned in numerous countries," Helene Thouy, lawyer for L214 told the AFP news agency.

But Roland Tonarelli, director general of Ernest Soulard, insisted that the video was a fake.

He added: 'Gavage is not on trial. The question is was there cruelty or not? We will show step by step, minute by minute that this is not the case.

'We have factual evidence to show that the video is a montage, and not all of it was filmed at our plant.'

The foie gras producer is counter suing L214 for trespass and damage to its property.

Mr Tonarelli added: 'We are not barbarians - the video has damaged producers and created a climate of suspicion.'

The European Union banned individual cages for birds in 2011, but gave producers until the end of 2015 to install larger collective cages for the gavage.

France produces almost three quarters of the world's foie gras and has around 8,000 producers.

The process of obtaining foie gras is so cruel its production has been banned in Britain, but imports from across the Channel are not controlled.
