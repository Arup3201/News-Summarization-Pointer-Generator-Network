Two men died last night as a fishing trip came to a tragic end at a Scottish reservoir.

Sean Marshall, 20, plunged into Mill Glen Reservoir near Ardrossan, Ayrshire, after his close friend Ross Munn, who had gone for a swim, disappeared beneath the surface.

Mr Marshall, known to his friends as Sean Paul, was visiting the beauty spot during a fishing trip with friends.

Other friends in the group could only watch in horror as Mr Marshall, of Saltcoats, and Mr Munn, of Ardorossan, failed to surface from the icy water, and ran to a nearby farmhouse to raise the alarm.

A search and rescue operation was launched at around 8pm on Monday night and a police underwater unit, helicopter and 10 firefighters were sent to the scene.

The friends lifeless bodies were found by specialist police divers shortly before midnight.

Mill Glen is a small reservoir with an earth embankment dam about a mile north-east of Ardrossan.

Tribute: A well-wisher visits the scene of the tragic accident to lay a bunch of flowers in memory of the two friends

Floral tributes have been left at the scene of the tragedy and grieving friends have paid tribute to the pair.

A neighbour of Mr Marshall said: 'Sean Paul was so full of life and would help anyone.

'I heard there was a group of five or six of them up at the dam. Supposedly they had spent the day up there fishing.

Heartbreak: Friends of the pair have been left devastated by the death of the two young men

'One of the boys went in swimming and got into bother so Sean Paul jumped in to try and help him.

'The group of friends got help but it must have been too late. The dam is a popular spot for the kids to hang about but this just proves how dangerous it is up there.'

Close friend Stephanie Dave left a touching tribute at the scene.

She wrote: 'Still can't believe that both of you are gone, I'm so heartbroken both of you were too young.

'I'll miss you so much if only I could get one more hug and hear your voicesone last time.

'Love you both so much RIP.'

A friend said: 'Sean Paul and Ross were always really close pals.

'You never saw one without the other and they always hung about up at the dam.

'I think Ross had just finished school and Sean Paul was talking about going back to college.

'They were both lovely guys and Sean Paul is being named a hero all over Facebook. He would do anything for anyone and its such a shame.

'I didn't know Ross that well but he was really funny. Sean Paul had two brothers and they will be devastated.'

There are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the incident and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.

Superintendent Neil Kerr warned people of the dangers of playing or swimming in open water during warm weather.

'It may look calm on the surface, but there may be strong undercurrents,' he said.

'The water can also be very cold and deep, and there are often sudden drops and underwater obstacles and undergrowth that you cannot see, causing even the strongest of swimmers to get into difficulty very easily.'

Carlene McAvoy, Scotland's community safety development officer for the Royal Society of the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'RoSPA's advice is to go swimming at properly-supervised sites, such as beaches, lidos or swimming pools, although we appreciate that not everyone can get to these locations.'
