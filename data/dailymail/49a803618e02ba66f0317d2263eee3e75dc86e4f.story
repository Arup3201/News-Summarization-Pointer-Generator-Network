A toddler who miraculously survived an horrific road smash which killed his young mother was being comforted by his family today.

Little Rory Taylor was strapped into a booster seat when Georgina Taylor, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, lost control of her Mini Cooper which overturned and burst into flames.

Miss Taylor, 22, suffered fatal head and serious neck injuries and died around 12 hours later.

But 13 month old Rory escaped with cuts and bruises after three passing motorists stopped at the crash scene and used a fire extinguisher to smash a rear window, put the fire out and pull the toddler clear.

Rory was taken for a check up but is now being cared for by his mother's family.

Today tributes were paid to Miss Taylor who was heading into Manchester at the time of crash at 8.55am on Saturday.

Greater Manchester Police said she lost control of her silver saloon and collided with trees on the A627 (M) southbound, near Oldham.

'We currently have specially trained officers with them to help get through this horrendous ordeal. I would ask anyone who may have been driving along the A627(M) near to Elk Mill and witnessed the collision to call us.'
