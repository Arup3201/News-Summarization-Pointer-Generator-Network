A British tourist holidaying in Africa has been stung to death by a swarm of bees.

Mick Bryan, 61, and his 43-year-old wife Jacqueline were attacked at a campsite in Tanzania.

The couple, from Ramsey in Cambridgeshire, were about to have lunch when the swarm descended and started to sting them.

Mrs Bryan ran for help but her mechanic husband, who has three children from a previous marriage, collapsed and died later in hospital.

A family member told the Sun: 'They were out in the middle of nowhere getting ready to have some lunch when they heard a buzzing noise. Mick shouted to Jacqueline to run.

'He was covered in bees. He tried to drive off but it all happened too quickly.

'Jacqueline couldn't get any phone reception so she had to run to the main road for help.'

Mr Bryan's sister Louise Adam, 64, said: 'He was a wonderful man. He'd do anything for anyone.'

A Foreign Office spokesman said: 'We can confirm the death of a British national in Tanzania. We are in touch with the family and are offering consular assistance.'
