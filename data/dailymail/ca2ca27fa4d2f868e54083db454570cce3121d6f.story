Aston Villa fans have requested owner Randy Lerner to orchestrate a quick sale, but to also ensure the new buyer has the club's best interests at heart.

After eight years at the helm, Lerner announced on Monday he was now looking to sell up, believing it time to seek 'fresh, invigorated leadership'.

Applauded: Aston Villa fans have shown their gratitude towards Randy Lerner but have encouraged a quick sale

After purchasing Villa for £62.6million from Doug Ellis in 2006, it is understood Lerner has slapped a price tag of around £200m on the club, with Bank of America Merrill Lynch appointed to organise the sale.

For now Villa, along with manager Paul Lambert, are in limbo.

It is why fans behind the Aston Villa Supporters' Trust (AVST) are anxious for Lerner to swiftly move on in order for the club to plan for next season and beyond.

A 
statement from AVST read: 'We would like to place on record our 
gratitude for all he (Lerner) has done with regards to the 
infrastructure of the club and his significant investment in Aston Villa
 over the past eight years.

Uncertain: Paul Lambert's future remains under question as Aston Villa boss

Full voice: Villa fans want a quick sale and for any potential new owner to respect the club's traditions and values

'AVST wish Mr Lerner the very best in his future endeavours. We are sure all Villa supporters appreciate the great respect he has shown for the club's traditions and heritage during his time here.

'We are also sure that, with this in mind, he will make it a consideration of the utmost importance that these traditions should continue to be respected by whomever he passes his custodianship to.

'We would ask the sale is completed as quickly as possible in order that the new owner can put his team in place, and make the required changes to ensure Aston Villa become a competitive force on the field again.'
