Jet-setting Hollywood hunk Orlando Bloom knows a thing or two about long-haul flights from a career spent hopping between filming locations on all corners of the globe, not to mention his many trips to the homeland of his ex Miranda Kerr in Australia. 

So who better to offer up their advice on how to land refreshed and minimise the impact of jet lag?

The star of The Hobbit and Pirates of the Caribbean tells fellow frequent travellers to do their best to adjust to the time zone they're headed for, avoid dehydration drink plenty of water and steering clear of alcohol and eat well.

Frequent flyer: British Airways global ambassador Orlando Bloom offers his top travel tips to avoid jetlag

Down Under: The star of The Hobbit is promoting BA's discounted flights promotion for the festive season

Bloom, who has spent the past fortnight in Down Under entertaining Lord of The Rings fans at Comic-Con conventions in Sydney and Brisbane, is a British Airways global ambassador and was offering his top tips as part of their promotion for discounted flights ahead of the festive season. 

The actor was travelling to and from Australia frequently before his amicable split with Victoria's Secret model Kerr, with whom he shares custody of their three-year-old son Flynn, and now visits there once or twice a year to visit friends and extended family. He's previously referred to the island nation as a 'home away from home'.

Just like any big kid, Bloom relished the chance at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport to pose in the cockpit of a Boeing 777-300 for his BA role that is offering cheap deals for flights from Australia at the end of the year.

Bloom's other travel tips include making sure you have lots of entertainment for little ones to play with while in the air, speaking from experience having often travelled with Flynn, and wearing comfortable clothes 

'If you can, try and hit the gym or do some exercise when you arrive at your destination to avoid jet lag,' Bloom adds.

BA's offer to Australians and expats includes 10 per cent off fares for their daily flights from Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore's Changi Airport.
