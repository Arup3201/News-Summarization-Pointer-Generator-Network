A former Navy SEAL turned prominent TV personality has been charged for allegedly lying about being shot by a random attacker in a mall parking lot.

Christopher Mark Heben, 44, has been summoned to appear at Bath Police Department in Ohio today after being charged with obstructing justice and falsification.

Police Chief Michael McNeely told MailOnline today despite vast evidence against Heben's claim that he was shot in the stomach following a fight with three men, the veteran maintains he is telling the truth. 

Heben, who has served in Iraq, Africa, Pakistan and Afghanistan, told police in March that he was shot by the driver of a car who   backed into him.

TV star: Chris Heben has made a career for himself by appearing on major news networks to discuss issues of defense and government foreign policy

In a sequence straight from an action movie, Heben said he chased after his assailant and then, realizing he was bleeding profusely, drove himself to a police station to seek treatment. 

The former SEAL, who makes regular appearances on Fox and CNN, underwent surgery and police launched an extensive search for his attackers.  

According to News 5, Heben got into a shouting match with three black men in a car which  backed into him in the parking lot of the Mustard Seed Market & Cafe at 5.30pm on March 28 at West Market Plaza in Akron, Ohio.

He then continued to the cafe - before turning back to his car after realizing he had left his wallet behind.

As he walked across the parking lot, the vehicle pulled alongside him  and Heben realized he had been shot, Bath Township Police Chief Michael McNeely told the Akron Beacon Journal at the time. Heben then jumped into his car and followed the vehicle - a gray sports car with tinted windows - as it drove north and headed to Interstate 77.

Realizing he was covered in blood and had been shot, Heben drove himself to the Bath Township Police and Fire Department for help.

Heben served as a Navy SEAL for ten years before retiring in 2006. Since then, he had made a career out of media appearances 

'He indicated to us he actually plugged the hole in his abdomen to stop the bleeding as he drove to the station,' McNeely said.

He was hospitalized at Akron General Medical Center, where a 'brass projectile' was removed from his abdomen and then the wound was stapled shut. 

Chief McNeely told MailOnline today that a detective had worked on the case for 30 to 40 hours a week and uncovered inconsistencies between what Heben told the police over several interviews and the media reports he gave.

Cell phone records also showed he was not at the mall at the time he claimed the shooting took place. 

The police followed up on numerous tips that had been called in regarding the assailant's 'gray sports car' - but they led nowhere.  

Chief McNeely confirmed that Heben did have surgery for a gunshot wound but could not say when it took place - only that it did not happen in the parking lot of the Mustard Seed Market. 

The chief was also at a loss to explain why Heben would make up such an elaborate lie. 

McNeely added: 'We have a low-crime, non-violent community and when this was first reported, it caused quite a stir. We want to reassure people that this has been investigated fully and that we remain one of the safer communities in the county.'

Heben is currently a spokesman for the Montrose Auto Group in Ohio. MailOnline was awaiting a statement from Director of Marketing, Vinny Maculaitis, on Thursday but he confirmed that the car firm would continue to work with the veteran. 

Following his alleged heroics at the mall, Heben constantly updated his Facebook group in March with information about his recovery.

'I've been up walking around, yesterday and again this morning,' he wrote on Sunday, two days after the shooting. 'The nurses are telling me to "take it slow".....YEAH RIGHT!

Navy veteran Chris Heben has been charged after he allegedly made up a story about being shot in the stomach in a mall parking lot in March this year. He is due in court on September 11

'The best thing for me to do is to keep my spirits up and to just keep moving! Onward and upward!'

He has also uploaded pictures to the Facebook page, which has more than 28,000 likes today, showing his medication and of his abdomen covered with a large bandage.

Heben, a father, served as a SEAL for a decade before retiring in 2006. Since, he has worked as a special operations expert on cable news networks and shows.

He has appeared on shows that have aired on the History Channel, the Discovery Channel and Channel 4 in the UK.

His website says he is the founder of INVICTVS Group, a special operations consortium, and holds a master's degree in physician assistant studies, specializing in sports medicine and emergency medicine.

He is also a public speaker and released his first album, The Patriot Project, in the spring.

He is due in court on September 11 on the misdemeanor charges. If found guilty he will face a fine but possible jail time. 

Heben has a prior criminal history. In 2008, he pleaded no contest to three counts of forgery in Ohio and had his physician's assistant license suspended by the Ohio Medical Board for writing up fake prescriptions.
