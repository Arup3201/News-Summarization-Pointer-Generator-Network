Every time Alfie the terrier, above, was exposed to pollen he had an allergic reaction which left him trapped indoors with painful red and itchy sores.

But now the one-year-old can go walkies again thanks to this Lycra ‘onesie’.

Owner Joanne Mitchell, 50, of Cullingworth, West Yorkshire, tried various treatments before discovering the lightweight, breathable suit from US company K9 Top Coat.

'He's so much better now and the sores have really settled down,' Ms Mitchell said

‘He’s so much better now and the sores have really settled down,’ she said. ‘He puts his little head in and lifts his paws up to help me put it on.’

The swanky suit proved such a hit with Jack Russell Terrier Alfie that Joanne went on to order a second.

Ms Mitchell added: 'He was booked in to be castrated around April, May time and I noticed he had a really itchy red tummy.

'I thought it might be fleas at first but after talking to the vet we realised it might be a pollen allergy.

Painful: Alfie's sores before he got the coat

'We tried numerous things including Piriton but nothing seemed to work and he was just miserable.

'It got to the point where he was just trapped in the house unable to go out. To have a dog that can't even go out for a walk is just awful, I felt terrible.

'I decided to do some research online and that's when I came across K9 Top Coat.

'Everything changed from there. He wears his bodysuit all day long and he loves it.

'Now he can go and play outside and enjoy running around without a care.

'It's been so great I've bought him another so I can alternate. He'll have his own little wardrobe full of them soon.'

June Lotz, co-founder of K9 Top Coat, said: 'I came up with the idea as a way of controlling shedding.

'Our first child was just beginning to crawl and with three large dogs it was impossible to keep our floors free of dog hair.

'Many people purchase one of our lycra bodysuits and have such great success they purchase more.

'There's nothing like having a dog wearing a lycra bodysuit in the park or walking down the street to draw people's attention.
