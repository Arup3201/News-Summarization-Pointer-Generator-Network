The owner of a remote-control plane has been ordered to pay £4,340 in fines and costs after it crashed in a no-fly zone near a BAE Systems shipyard that builds nuclear submarines.

Robert Knowles lost control of the £2,000 delta-wing plane fitted with a surveillance camera and it ended up in the sea.

It was washed up weeks later and police traced the TV repairman because the camera had recorded his car registration number as the plane took off.

The aircraft also bore the name of his company, Vision TV Repairs.

Knowles, 46, was convicted in his absence of failing to comply with air regulations.

He
 was found to be in control of an unmanned aircraft which travelled 
within 50metres of Walney Bridge in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, and over
 the nearby BAE shipyard. The aircraft, with a 1.35m wingspan and 
weighing 1.86kg, crashed into Walney Channel and was recovered by a BAE 
employee.

It is against air regulations to fly aircraft over the BAE facility without permission from the Civil Aviation Authority.

Knowles
 failed to attend the hearing and his defence lawyer was withdrawn as a 
result. He had previously pleaded not  guilty to two counts of failing 
to comply with air regulations on the basis that he was not in  control 
of the plane.

Beware incoming: A man from Cumbria has become the first person in the UK to be successfully prosecuted for the dangerous and illegal flying of an unmanned aircraft (UAV). A stock image of a quadcopter drone is pictured, but Robert Knowles' UAV was homemade

Punished: Mr Knowles, of Barrow-in-Furness, was found guilty on April 1 and fined £800 at Furness and District Magistrate Court.
The court heard that on August 25, a UAV was recovered from water near to a submarine testing facility in Barrow-in-Furness (pictured) operated by the defence company, BAE Systems

Last October 
Knowles, of  Dalton, Cumbria, said: ‘I think it’s all a bit 
heavy-handed. I understand safety concerns, but at the end of the day I 
would not have put my name on the plane if I was a bomber or a spy.’ On 
Tuesday he was fined £800 at Furness Magistrates’ Court for being both 
the controller and operator of the plane.

He was also ordered to pay £3,500 in court costs and a £40 victim surcharge.

District
 judge Gerald Chalk said: ‘The aircraft had a camera on it and the film 
has been shown to me. It shows the route the aircraft took over the 
bridge and over the nuclear facility. It shows a man operating the 
aircraft and a parked car.’

The
 court heard that Knowles had carried out seven flights from Walney on 
the day last August. He used a sensor from the aircraft to follow each 
flight on a laptop.

Alison 
Slater, prosecuting on behalf of the Civil Aviation Authority, said that
 the video footage showed Knowles launching the aircraft, incriminating 
himself in the process.

She 
said: ‘The footage was taken to Greater Manchester Police for analysis. 
The aircraft was in the charge of Mr Knowles and he was the operator of 
it.’

In an email to Robert 
Webb, standards officer from the Civil Aviation Authority, Knowles said 
he lost sight of the aircraft and could not locate it.

He
 said he didn’t know how he lost control of the plane, and couldn’t rule
 out ‘outside influence’. He is said to be considering an appeal against
 the verdict.

Found: The drone was reportedly found crashed in water near to BAE Systems' submarines testing facility in Barrow-in-Furness (pictured). After it was recovered, the UAV was traced to Mr Knowles who admitted to building the device himself and operating it on the day in question

Robert Knowles, 46, was found to have flown his homemade aircraft into restricted airspace over a nuclear submarine facility

He also flew his drone, which was equipped with a video camera, too close to a vehicle bridge in an illegal manoeuvre

Both offences breached the UK’s Air Navigation Order and he was found guilty on April 1 and fined £800 at Furness and District Magistrate Court

The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the conviction sends a message to recreational users of drones that they are subject to aviation safety rules
