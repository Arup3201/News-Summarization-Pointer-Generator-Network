Young British women have better qualifications than men and think their jobs are 'worthwhile,' but are still earning less, according to a new survey.

Published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the research was carried out on 16-24 year old men and women in Britain between 2011 and 2013.

81 per cent of women, compared with 77 per cent of men said what they do in life is worthwhile.

According to new research from the Office of National Statistics, women aged 16-24 are happier overall than men in the same age bracket, but less satisfied with their income and living conditions

However young men were more likely to report low levels of anxiety - 66 per cent compared with 63 per cent of young women.

Statistics from the Department for Education show that in England attainment by age 19 at both National Qualifications Framework Level 2 and Level 3 was higher for women than for men.

In 2012, 87 per cent  of young women had attained Level 2 by age 19, compared with 81 per cent of young men.

Furthermore, statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency show that a higher proportion of women students obtained a first or upper second class first degree than men in 2012/13 (70 per cent  compared with 65 per cent).

But despite their academic achievements, young women are not as satisfied with their income as young men.

This could well be down to the fact that men tend to be paid more and are more likely to be employed on a full-time basis.

When asked if they were satisfied with their household income, 55 per cent of men and 49 per cent of women said that they were.

Just 22 per cent of women reported that they were living comfortably, compared to 26 per cent of men, possibly because a higher proportion of lone parent households are headed by a woman.

Young men are less likely to have higher education and qualifications than women, but still earn more and are more likely to be in full-time employment, according to new research from the Office for National Statistics

Both young men and women reported that they found managing their finances ‘difficult’ or ‘very difficult.’

Men are more likely to be satisfied with their overall health than young women, but women are more likely to report some symptoms of depression or anxiety (26 per cent compared with 16 per cent).

They are also are more likely to have someone they can rely on: When questioned, 86 per cent of woman said that they had someone they could talk to.

The figure was a lower 78 per cent for men.

The Mental Health Foundation said: ‘Men are often particularly reluctant to talk about emotional issues.

‘Friendship is a crucial element in protecting our mental health.’

This study is just the first in a series of measures taken by the ONS into looking at national well-being for people aged 16-24.

The new proposed set of measures was drafted in March and, say the ONS, work is ongoing in this area.

‘We will publish an update taking into account data availability and ongoing feedback,’ states the research.

‘The figures detailed in this article are an initial analysis of selected draft measures of young people’s well-being which considers whether there is a difference between young men and young women.’
