Tragic: War hero William Davis, 92, who was believed to have served in the Navy, was found dead at a house in Willenhall, West Midlands

A woman who used to take meals round to a decorated war veteran found battered to death at his home has been arrested on suspicion of his murder.

Mother-of-three Charlotte  Doody, 35, who lived opposite 92-year-old William Davis, was last night being questioned over the killing of the ‘fiercely independent’ pensioner.

Neighbours said the builder’s wife was among several residents of Hobley Street who used to keep an eye out for the widower.

Mr Davis, who was known as Bill and had a collection of medals from serving with the Royal Navy in the Second World War, was found in his heavily bloodstained terraced house in  Willenhall, West Midlands, on Sunday.

Detectives have revealed the great grandfather was seen alive at around 3pm when a neighbour took him round some dinner.

Some time over the next three hours he was viciously beaten about the head with a blunt instrument before his killer fled.

Mrs Doody and her husband Michael, who runs a building firm, have three children.

On Tuesday, one of them wrote on Facebook: ‘OMG poor poor bill I will always miss u and I love  you xxx you was like a granddad to me.’

When asked by a friend ‘have u got questoined (sic) yet?’, she replied: ‘Nah mum as (sic).’

Neighbours said Mrs Doody was among several in the community always willing to help Mr Davis.

The woman, named locally as Charlotte Doody, was arrested at her home, just yards from where the frail widower was found collapsed in a pool of blood.

He died as a result of severe head injuries, West Midlands Police said.

Mrs Doody was being questioned by police, as forensic teams scoured her property. She would regularly deliver meals to the pensioner who walked with the aid of a zimmer frame, according to neighbours.

Neighbour Jaga Sehmbi, 56, said of Mr Davis: ‘Everyone knew him. I would see him walking down the road taking small steps.

‘I would stop and talk to him for half an hour. He had so much knowledge, especially about the local area.

‘The community is devastated, it’s shocking. You could never think anyone would harm such a lovely old bloke.’

At a press conference held by the force yesterday, Detective Superintendent Richard Baker described Mr Davis as a fiercely independent decorated war veteran who was father to two, grandfather to four and a great-grandfather to one.

He said: 'Bill used to go into Willenhall on a weekly basis. He tended his own garden and maintained his home on his own.

'He was very well-known in the local community and used to stop and chat to his neighbours.

'We know he was seen at 9am on Sunday April 1 in his front garden, where he stopped and chatted to passers-by.

'At around 3.15pm a neighbour took 
some lunch round to his house. At 6pm concerned neighbours who were 
unable to rouse Bill gained access to his property and found him.'

Step by step: Police search Hobley Street, Willenhall, West Midlands, following the suspected murder of William Davis

The house remains sealed off and forensic searches are continuing.

Mr Baker appealed for anyone who might have been in the Fisher Street and Hobley Street area on Sunday to come forward.

Mr Davis, who worked as a locksmith 
after leaving the Navy and was known as Bill, lost his wife Clara in 
2006, three years after they marked their diamond wedding anniversary.

The couple had a son and a daughter as
well as several grandchildren and one great-grandchild, who neighbours 
said visited regularly.

Paramedics were called to the house 
where he had lived alone early on Sunday evening after the alarm was 
raised, but Mr Davis was pronounced dead at the scene.

Mr Baker on Sunday described the scene
where Mr Davis was killed as 'heavily bloodstained.' He said: 'There's 
an item that was found at the scene next to Mr Davis' body.

'It has been submitted for forensic examination. It's my belief that another item was used in the attack on Mr Davis.

'The type of item used could have been taken from the home address or could have been brought to the address.

'He died from multiple head injuries, 
some of which we believe were caused by a blunt instrument. It appears 
that when paramedics first arrived there was a light pulse but he died 
shortly afterwards.'

Police confirmed there was no sign of a
forced break in at Mr Davis' home and nothing was stolen. Mr Baker 
added: 'It appears to be a very violent attack.

Officers were called to the scene at around 6.30pm on Sunday evening

'The motive is still unexplained but 
there doesn't appear to be any sign of forced entry or any sign of a 
search within the address. There's also no indication of anything being 
stolen.

'It's highly likely that the person or persons responsible for this may have left the address heavily blood stained.'

He also pointed out that anyone responsible would have left the address heavily blood-stained.

Neighbours spoke of their shock at the savage killing.

An employee at the local newsagent 
said Mr Davis had been going there to buy his paper every day for 60 
years until difficulty walking meant he couldn’t manage it any more.

‘He would say hello to everybody in 
the street, he was a really kind bloke,’ he said. ‘You would look at him
and think “He’s not 90, he’s about 70”.

‘The amount of stories he’s told me and the medals he has shown me – it was unreal.

‘What happened yesterday was a proper shock. It’s absolutely tragic.

‘We heard that somebody had broken in 
and stabbed him after he tried to challenge them but the police are not 
telling us anything.’

Pamela Griffin, 72, who lived opposite
Mr Davis for more than 20 years, said: ‘William was a lovely man, very 
kind and generous and would talk to anyone. He would always talk about 
his time in the Navy. He was very proud of his war medals.

‘I last saw him on Saturday afternoon.
He was pottering in his front garden and looked happy and cheerful.’ 
Police have refused to say how Mr Davis died or whether there were any 
signs of a break-in at his home. They described him as a ‘very 
well-regarded, nice elderly gentleman’.

Mr Davis is believed to have served during World War Two and been awarded several medals.

Today Mr Baker appealed for anyone who
knows a friend, neighbour or associate who had blood-stained clothing 
and was either trying to conceal them or wash them to come forward.
