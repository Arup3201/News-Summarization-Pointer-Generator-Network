A nine-year-old girl has been arrested after her mother called cops to report that she had hit her younger sister.

The unidentified mother called authorities in Indianapolis over the weekend and 'stated that her nine-year-old daughter punched her six-year-old sister in the head', according to the police report.

The mother even filmed the incident on her cell phone and showed it to the responding officer. 

'The officer made the decision to arrest,' officer Rafael Diaz told Fox59. 

Scene: Police went to this home in Indianapolis over the weekend and arrested a nine-year-old girl for hitting her six-year-old sister on the head after the girls' mother called authorities

The young girl was put in handcuffs and arrested for battery.

She was taken by the Sheriff's Department wagon to juvenile detention.

Authorities will now make a decision on how to proceed and her parents will be able to access services for help, Fox reported.

Diaz said authorities never want to arrest a child but sometimes it can be a way for desperate parents to get access to services for children who are out-of-control. 

No surprises: Officer Rafael Diaz, pictured, told Fox59 that police actually arrest a surprising number of juveniles but that the arrests allow their parents to get help for out-of-control children

Organizations like the Boys and Girls Clubs of Indianapolis work with children after school to help them avoid trouble from a young age, Fox59 reported. They work with other children and on conflict issues at the organizations

Diaz also said that the case was by no means unusual.  

'It happens,' he said. 'It seems like we spend a lot of our time dealing with juvenile issues.'
