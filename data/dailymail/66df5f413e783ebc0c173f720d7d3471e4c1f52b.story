Poverty is not a barrier to success at school, a respected international organisation said yesterday.

Factors such as poorly educated parents and run-down neighbourhoods condemn underprivileged families to a cycle of ‘social disadvantage’, according to some education experts.

But the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development dismissed the assumption as a ‘myth’.

Research shows children from disadvantaged backgrounds in some countries outperform the wealthiest children in other nations in maths, it said.

Poverty is not a barrier to success at school, a respected international organisation said yesterday

The poorest ten per cent of pupils in Shanghai are generally more advanced than the richest 20 per cent of children in the UK, for example.

The gap between wealthy Shanghai children and underprivileged British children is equivalent to six years of education by the age of 15.

In the Netherlands, children from the poorest families can be up to a year ahead of a child from a similar background in the UK at the same age.

The findings suggest the social and economic background of a pupil is far less important than the quality of the teaching in their school and the education system in which it operates.

OECD spokesman Andrew Schleicher said the data ‘debunks the myth that poverty is destiny’.

His intervention will lend weight to the argument of those who say fundamental problems in education should be addressed to help more poor children go to university rather than so-called social engineering, under which top universities have been encouraged to accept candidates with lower grades if they come from deprived backgrounds.

Details were released the day after Michael Gove said money matters in education but not as much as ‘attitude - ambition, expectation - an ethos of excellence’.

The Education Secretary said improvements in a range of areas including the curriculum, exams, discipline and the quality of teaching meant the days of the ‘bog standard’ comprehensive were numbered as state schools catch up with the independent sector.

Interviewed on ITV’s This Morning yesterday, he added the flexibility being handed to maintained schools meant they had freedoms similar to those of fee-paying institutions, like choosing whether to set homework or dedicating every afternoon to extra-curricular activities to build character.

‘All that I really want to do is to try and make sure that children from poorer homes, whose parents can’t afford private schools, get an education every bit as good,’ he said.

The OECD analysis was based on tests sat by tens of thousands of 15-year-olds in 40 developed countries or major economic regions in 2012 - before Coalition reforms began to take effect.

These have already shown that the UK remained a middle-ranking nation overall under Labour despite tens of billions extra being pumped into education.

Further research into the maths skills of the most deprived ten per cent of pupils found those in big-spending Britain were not keeping pace with high-performing areas such as South Korea, Singapore and Shanghai and Hong Kong in China.

Mr Schleicher added: ‘Poverty isn’t destiny. For example the poorest 15-year-olds in Shanghai... do as well as the ten per cent most privileged students in the United States and 20 per cent in the UK.

‘The data clearly show that, for many countries, the issue is not just with poor kids in poor neighbourhoods but with many kids in many neighbourhoods.

‘The bottom line is that the country where you go to school seems to have a much greater impact on your learning outcome than the social background of your family or even your country.’

Chris McGovern, of the Campaign for Real Education, said Mr Gove was ‘absolutely right’ to say attitude trumps funding.

But he added: ‘The OECD figures show how vastly better our competitors are doing.‘We get complacent about our top schools but they are doing pretty badly on the international scale.’
