It is known as Spain's answer to Beverly Hills, but not all the properties in exclusive Sotogrande are as stylish as America's millionaire enclave.

The palatial Villa Flamingo, set in the eastern hills of Andalusia's residential development, has just gone on the market for a staggering €12,999,999 (£10,000,000).

The villa has  affluent neighbours but it's doubtful their properties are  as eye-catching, or feature such devastating attention to detail, as this Egyptian hideaway decked out in gold.

'My passion for movies and theatre, intertwined with my love for all things historical, inspired me to create an atmosphere that would blend in Hollywood and Broadway with ancient times, always with a luxurious finish throughout,' he says.

Sotogrande is the largest privately owned residential development in Andalusia. It sits in the south of Spain, where the Andalucian Sierras and the prolific Guadiaro River meet the Mediterranean Sea and is populated by tennis, golf and polo stars.

The Sotogrande climate is typical of the Mediterranean, with long blisteringly hot summers and milder winters. Gibraltar is the nearest airport.
