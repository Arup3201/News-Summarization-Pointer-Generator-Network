A set of rare 'mono mono' twins born holding hands in Ohio are going to be home in time for Father's Day.

Jenna and Jillian Thistlethwaite were born May 9 sharing an amniotic sac and placenta at Akron General Medical Center, in the state's northwest.

After spending nearly a month in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, the Akron Beacon Journal reports that the identical twins went home in Orrville in northeast Ohio on Saturday.

Their father, Bill Thistlethwaite, says he's excited to have the girls at home with him, his wife and their 15-month-old son, Jaxon.

He said he
 and his wife, Sarah, were approached by people Saturday while having 
breakfast at a diner in their hometown of Orrville before going to visit
 the girls.

They want to know how the twins are doing and express their 
good wishes, he said.

Both girls are taking full bottles and have gained weight, each now at five pounds or more.

The twins' rare birth condition is called monoamnioitic, or 'mono mono'.

Doctors say they occur in about one of every 10,000 pregnancies.

Jenna was born first at 
four pounds, two ounces and 17 inches, with Jillian following 48 seconds
 later at three pounds, 13 ounces and 17.5 inches.

They were born at 33 
weeks and two days to their 32-year-old mother, a middle school math 
teacher.

They were moved to Akron Children's Hospital after birth because they needed breathing assistance.

Thistlethwaite
 has daydreamed about the time, years in the future, when he and his 
wife will show the girls their famous baby photo.

'I
 already feel like they're going to be best friends,' he said. 'They'll 
probably look at it and say, "That makes sense because that's how we 
are."'

Jenna and Jillian were delivered by Caesarean section at 2:41pm at Akron General Medical Center, the Akron Beacon Journal reports, and were holding hands when presented to parents Sarah and Bill Thistlethwaite in the delivery room.

'They’re already best friends,' Sarah told the paper. 'I can’t believe they were holding hands. That’s amazing.'

Dr. 
Melissa Mancuso, who delivered the monoamniotic girls along with Dr. 
Katherine Wolfe, told the paper that something like this normally 
'happens in about 1 in 10,000 pregnancies and 1 to 5 per cent of all 
twins.'

Monoamniotic
twins are the rarest type, Mancuso told the paper, with risks including
birth defects and tangled umbilical cords that might kill a twin.

Mother Sarah Thistlethwaite,
 a middle school math teacher, delivered the twins after spending 57 
days in bed, according to the Beacon Journal, and her 15-month-old son 
Jaxon was looked after by family and friends while she waited to give 
birth.

A hospital press release noted that Sarah, who took leave from her teaching position, was visited by husband Bill every day after work.
