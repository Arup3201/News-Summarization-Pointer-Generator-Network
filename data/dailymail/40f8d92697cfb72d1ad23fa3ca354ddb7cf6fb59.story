A man has been found hanged in his prison cell almost a month after he was charged with beating to death his girlfriend following a 'rough sex' session.

Jeffrey Dean White, 43, was discovered by prison wardens shortly after 9pm on Wednesday alone in his cell at the Weber County maximum security facility in Utah. He was declared dead a short time later.

White was charged with first-degree murder after his live-in partner, 38-year-old Marine Stark, was beaten to death while her two children, aged seven and nine, were at home.

The alleged killer told police that 
he and Ms Stark had argued in the aftermath of a violent sex session on October 20
which involved him choking her.

It
followed what friends and family said was a long history of abuse, in 
which he reportedly knocked her out, broke her ribs and 'tried to gouge 
her eyes out'.

Prison authorities said today that White was not on suicide watch.

White's lawyer James Retallick told the Salt Lake Tribune that it was 'baffling' that his client wasn't being monitored when he had proved to be mentally unstable during court appearances.

An autopsy will be conducted on White by the state medical examiner.

White called 911 at 10.15pm on October 20 and Stark was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital, her liver lacerated, caused by blunt force trauma.

In an autopsy the medical examiner said the injury was consistent with punches or kicks.

White was charged with one count of 
first-degree felony murder and two counts of third-degree domestic 
violence in the presence of a child.

Friends and family had tried to persuade the mother-of-two to leave White in the past.

Stark's mother, Jessie Franich, spoke at a viewing ahead of her daughter's funeral. 'We want people to know how totally, totally unnecessary it was,' she said.

'If a man says he’s going to stop hitting, he’s not. We couldn’t make her leave, I tried and tried. If I had to do it over, I would grab her by the hair of her head and haul her out.'
