Michael Le Vell's private life has been laid bare in court as he admitted to being an alcoholic, one-night stands and having an affair

Soap star Michael Le Vell told a court yesterday that the ‘dark secrets’ he admitted to were one-night stands, not child abuse.

The 48-year-old Coronation Street actor denies 12 sex offences against a young girl, including five of rape.

He told the jury at Manchester Crown Court that conversations he had about ‘something unforgivable’ concerned his extra-marital affairs.

But he denied a claim that he had told someone they would not believe ‘what things are inside my head’.

Le Vell, on trial under his real name Michael Turner, denied claims he drank up to 12 pints a night to hide the shame of being a paedophile.

The actor admitted he had a drink problem, had a series of one-night stands and had been having an affair while his wife was being treated for breast cancer.

But while he often drank seven or eight pints a night, and on occasions 12, he was never out of control and would never have sexually abused a six-year-old girl.

Eleanor Laws QC, prosecuting, suggested Le Vell drank so much because he was ashamed of the sexual abuse he had committed.

She asked the actor, who has played garage mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap for 30 years: ‘Are you a troubled man? Because something was troubling you... to go out every night?’

Le Vell replied: ‘No, I went out every night because I’m working class. It’s what my parents did before me.’

Asked whether the ‘secret’ was ‘more sinister’ than his affairs, he said: ‘No, not at all. There was no abuse going on.’

Miss
Laws said: ‘I suggest that at times when you were sober you were 
finding it difficult to live with yourself. This abuse started, you just
could not stop yourself.’

Le Vell replied: ‘No. Absolutely not. None of it ever happened.’

He
told the jury that he had an affair with Olivia Wallis, 32, while his 
wife was receiving chemotherapy for cancer because his 25-year marriage 
had been ‘crumbling’ and he had sought comfort from a close friend.

Alisdair
Williamson, defending, reminded the jury that Le Vell was a man of good
character. He asked: ‘Have you ever got so drunk that you decided to 
rape a six-year-old girl?’ The actor replied: ‘No.’

Earlier
the court heard that the girl, now a teenager, made her accusations 
after attending a motivational conference hosted by a woman who had been
raped as a young child.

The teenager – who cannot be named for legal reasons – then told her mother she had been abused for years.

The case continues.

The actor started giving evidence in his trial at Manchester Crown Court on Thursday
