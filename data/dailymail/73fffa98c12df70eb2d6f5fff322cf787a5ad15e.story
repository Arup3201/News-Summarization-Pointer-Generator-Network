Probed: The FBI reportedly investigated sci-fi master Ray Bradbury during the 1960s for alleged communist leanings and sympathies

American lit legend Ray Bradbury was probed by the FBI during the 1960s for alleged communist leanings and sympathies, according to The Huffington Post.

The revelation comes through a review of the Fahrenheit 451 author's FBI files, released to TheÂ  Post in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. Bradbury, a 2004 National Medal of Arts Award winner, died in June.

G-Men apparently surveilled the sci-fic legend's LA home around 1968 and tracked whether he traveled to Communist Cuba during the same year to participate the Cultural Congress at the Havana Libre Hotel.

Bradbury's file reportedly contained, among other things, his resume, background as well as subversive information,' which included the notation that he had a 'diagonal scar' on the left side of his forehead. The Bradbury dossier was ultimately added to Bureau's larger 'Communist Infiltration of the Radio-Television Industry,' The Huffington Post reports.

The Bureau, however, eventually concluded the author was not a communist after discussing the issue with various other informants.

'No evidence has been developed which indicates he was ever a member of the CP [Communist Party],' reportedly reads the Bradbury file.

In the end, the Bureau did not decide to interview the author about the topic.

Shocking Revelation: The news comes through a review of the author's FBI file, obtained by The Huffington Post in reply to a Freedom of Information Act request

Most of the file, The Huffington Post reports, is filled with the muddled and circuitous logic of Bradbury's main accuser, screenwriter Martin Berkeley, who actually WAS a member of the communist party.

Berkeley, the file notes, told the Bureau that some of Bradbury's stories, 'have been definitely slanted against the United States and its capitalistic form of government.'

Concerning Berkeley, the file reportedly said, 'Informant stated that the general aim of these science fiction writers is to frighten the people into a state of paralysis or psychological incompetence bordering on hysteria.

That hysteria, the file notes, 'would make it very possible to conduct a Third World War in which the American people would seriously believe [sic] could not be won since their morale had been seriously destroyed.'

The Accuser: Bradbury's chief accuser turns out to be screenwriter Martin Berkeley, who was a 'card-carrying' community party member, himself. Berkeley penned such movies as Revenge of the Creature

Berkeley reportedly told the FBI Bradbury was 'probably sympathetic with certain pro-Communist elements' in the Screen Writers Guild, The Huffington Post reports.

And the stool-pigeon told G-men Bradbury once stood up to vocally dencounce guild members as 'Cowards and McCarthyites' for considering a resolution that would have prevented Communists and writers from joining who invoked their 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination before the House Committee on Un-American Activites.

Berkeley ended up reportedly telling the committee that 155 people in Hollywood were active communists.

His betrayal, The Huffington Post reports, doomed his career, as he was relegated to penning B-movies like 'Tarantula' and 'The Deadly Mantis.'

Under Watch: Bradbury's Los Angeles home was under FBI surveillance as late as 1968, according to his FBI file
