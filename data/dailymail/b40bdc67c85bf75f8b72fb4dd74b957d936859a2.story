A disgruntled McDonald's customer has been charged with assault after she allegedly grabbed a young worker by the neck because she was unhappy with the fries she ordered.

The 38-year-old woman was a passenger in a BMW when she went through the McDonald's drive-through at Stanmore in Sydney's inner west on Tuesday night.

When she received her food from the 16-year-old girl at the drive-through hatch, the woman allegedly threw it back into the window and demanded a new order.

The young female employee asked the driver to pull into the waiting bay while a new order was prepared.

But the woman then allegedly got out of the car and entered the store yelling at the teenager.

Police say she grabbed the 16-year-old by the neck and scratched her face before the 21-year-old manager intervened to stop her. 

The manager grabbed the woman's hand and she allegedly scratched his arm before police were called and arrested her at the scene.
