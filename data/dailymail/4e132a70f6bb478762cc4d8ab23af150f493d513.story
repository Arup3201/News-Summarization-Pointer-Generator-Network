After feasting on too many fermented crabapples, a drunk squirrel has been filmed struggling to escape a snowy American backyard.

Its torment begins when he takes a tumble off a tall tree he would usually traverse so gracefully.

At first, the cameraman thinks the animal has hurt itself in the fall but soon realises it simply can't hold his crabapple.

Misery: The squirrel's problems begin when it falls from a tall tree into a snowy back garden in America

Fall: At first, the cameraman thinks the animal is hut but soon realises the small rodent is simply drunk

Daunting: The drunk squirrel eyes up the challenge ahead - a small mound of snow between him and an open fence 

His next great challenge is the small mound of snow between him and the open fence in an American backyard - a simple task made very difficult by his inebriated state.

Several attempts to charge up the hill end in failure - leaving the resilient rodent lying flat on his back gazing up at the branches he fell from earlier. 

He seems to have found a solution to his never-ending escape attempt when he targets a different region of the snow to the left - but several more attempts also end in failure.

In a sober state, the squirrel may simply have strolled around the fence which ended just a few feet to the right.

The shaky footage has gone viral since being uploaded to Live Leak and YouTube where it has already gained tens of thousands of hits.

After a few minutes of persistent climbing, the squirrel finally reaches the top of the tiny expanse of snow and rushes home - presumably to get some rest.

Persistent: The little animal continuously charges at the small mound of snow but always ends up flat on his back

Escape: Finally, after minutes of continuous jumping - much of it on the spot - it reaches the fence it could simply have walked around

Freedom: With a similar lack of grace, the squirrel darts through the fence and up a slightly easier hill
