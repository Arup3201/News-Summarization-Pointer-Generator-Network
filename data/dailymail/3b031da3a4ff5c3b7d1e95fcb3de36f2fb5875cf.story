Nestled in a wooded valley which is home to rabbits, deer and even a holy well, Whichford seems the ideal location for a holistic retreat.

But the peace and quiet of the sleepy Cotswolds village has been shattered by a war of words between a band of well-heeled residents – led by a millionaire author – and the couple behind the ‘alternative campsite’ and adjoining ‘house of healing’.

Andy Birtwell, 67, and his wife Sally, 63, opened Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre on the edge of the south Warwickshire community a decade ago.

Objection: Andy and Sally Birtwell deny their Holycombe Spritual Development Centre hosts rowdy raves and drunken revellers

Claims: Site owners Andy Birtwell, and his wife Sally say Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre attracts people looking for a quiet setting

The centre, which boasts its own stone 
circle, plays host to yoga teachers, Pilates instructors, meditation 
groups and song and dance sessions.

But their closest neighbour, 
author Terry Maher, 73, who wrote a best-selling memoir, Against My 
Better Judgement, and novel Unfinished Business, is taking legal action
against the couple after they were granted retrospective planning 
permission for the 30-pitch campsite earlier this month.

Some of the 
village’s 320 residents are even threatening to boycott donations to the
local 12th century church, St Michael’s, after Mr Birtwell suggested 
his centre enjoyed a ‘symbiotic relationship’ with the church.

Mr 
Maher, whose £1million home lies 400 yards from the campsite, is 
attempting to get a judicial review to overturn the council’s decision.

The
former chairman of defunct bookseller Dillons has lived in the village 
with wife Barbara for 30 years.

He said: ‘I have been friends with Andy 
and Sally for many, many years and I even persuaded him to buy the land.

‘Everything
was fine, and we had no opposition to the holistic centre but the 
campsite is causing noise which is very intrusive to us.

Permission: The Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre overlooking the rolling Cotswold hills was granted permission to hold weddings in its grounds

‘If we sit 
on our terrace, and with a prevailing wind, we can hear conversations 
from the campsite quite clearly as well as children playing.

‘It does not fit with the atmosphere of a quiet village in the Cotswolds.’

Mrs Maher, 70, added: ‘The Birtwells were good friends of ours and we are sad that it’s come to this.

‘It’s been a spoiler in the village, there’s no friendship any more.’

Another
resident, London solicitor Bridget Barker, 55, complained of ‘terrible 
noise pollution’ over the years from ‘rowdy campers, chanting and 
singing’.

She added: ‘One of the worst things is that people come into the village and park all over the place.

‘It got particularly bad in 2011 which was what prompted us all  to complain.’

The
retreat is situated where a Norman castle once stood, although now 
only a shallow moat remains.

Idyllic: Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre has been run from this site in the Cotswold village of Whichford by Andy Birtwell, 67, and his wife Sally, 63, for the past 10 years

Tranquil: Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre is set in the middle of picturesque countryside

Mr Birtwell said initially, only a handful 
of people camped each year – within rules which allowed camping on the 
site for less than 28 days a year without planning permission.

But 
the popularity of the site took off in 2011 after it was featured in a 
national newspaper article on ‘cool campsites’ and neighbours began to 
complain about noise caused by groups of guests drinking late into the 
night and playing loud music.

The Birtwells said they rebranded the 
site as a ‘quiet’ destination, where radios and instruments of any kind 
were banned – except, of course, the acoustic guitar.

The couple, who
have six children, also introduced a policy only to admit singles, 
couples or families – barring large groups.

They denied guests parked in
the village and said vehicles were left alongside the tents.

Their 
retrospective planning application for a 30-pitch campsite – including 
four furnished bell tents – was approved by Stratford-on-Avon District 
Council.

Mr Birtwell, who runs a water purifying company, said: ‘We took
full responsibility for the noisy guests we had  in 2011.

'The problem 
was we  were getting lots of couples booking who turned out to be part 
of larger groups.

‘Since then we have imposed an 11pm noise curfew 
and banned virtually all forms of music. The council have had no 
complaints about noise from our site since.

Conversion: Holycombe Spiritual Development Centre had been a junk yard, pictured in 1995, before it was taken over by Andy Birtwell and his wife Sally

‘Our holistic retreat 
attracts the sort of people who want to be quiet. The only noise now is 
the sound of children playing during summer weekends.’

Mrs Birtwell 
said the retreat was used mostly by middle-aged  couples and walkers 
wanting to ‘enjoy the countryside in peace and quiet’.

Stratford 
District Council, which is responding to the seven claims for a judicial
review, refused to comment. A spokesman said: ‘It would be 
inappropriate for us to comment while legal proceedings are continuing.’
