Unhappy visit: Mr Thompson at the McDonald's where he was refused service

Alistair Thompson had promised to buy his four-year-old son Edward a McDonald’s meal as a treat.

So when he found that his trailer bike was too big for the bicycle rack at his local branch he had what seemed like a bright idea.

He rode the bike into the restaurant’s drive-thru.

But when he reached the payment window staff refused to serve him, saying that the bike was a health and safety risk and that only motorised vehicles were allowed in the drive-thru.

Yesterday Mr Thompson, 35, condemned the ‘daft policy’, which he said showed ‘a complete lack of common sense’.

He said: ‘I was out for the day riding with my son in the trailer when he asked if – as a treat – he could have a Happy Meal. I don’t normally go to McDonald’s but I said OK.

‘As the bike has a sizeable trailer on it, it wasn’t suitable for the bike rack and it stuck out too much so I decided to go through the drive-thru.’

The father of two, from Portsmouth, was able to order the meal over an intercom at the drive-thru at the city’s Pompey Centre and waited in the queue of cars for about 15 minutes.

But when he eventually reached the payment window on his £600 trailer bike, he was refused service.

‘The staff claimed they couldn’t serve me
 because I was not in a motorised vehicle. I asked them why and they 
said because of health and safety reasons,’ Mr Thompson said.

‘I was baffled. If my bike is safe enough for the road, surely it is safe enough for a drive-thru in a car park with a 5mph limit? It’s a daft policy.

‘It struck me as showing a complete lack of common sense, especially as they serve people on mopeds and motorbikes. I was so cross I rang the Health and Safety Executive and they said it was nonsense.’

A motorist ahead of Mr Thompson overheard him being turned away and offered to buy the meal for him but was told by staff that she could not. The father and son decided to leave without the Happy Meal and went to a local restaurant instead.

Mr Thompson, who runs his own public relations company, plans to write to the branch manager and the fast food chain’s head office to complain.

McDonald’s said: ‘It is our policy not to serve cyclists through the drive-thru lanes. They are designed for road-going motor vehicles.

‘The policy takes into account situations in which a cyclist’s safety could be compromised, such as the close proximity with motor vehicles and the limited visibility of cycles, particularly given the sharp corners in some of our drive-thru lanes.’

Truth: Health and Safety Executives said the McDonad's in Portsmouth's Pompey Centre should have explained that it was unsafe to be so close to motor vehicles

But a spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said there was no legislation preventing cyclists from using a drive-thru.

‘McDonald’s should state the real reason for turning away cyclists rather than using health and safety as a catch-all,’ he added.

This is not the first time staff at the chain have refused to serve customers citing health and safety reasons.

Last month it apologised for turning away grandmother Kate Legg, 76, who tried to order a milk shake from her mobility scooter at a drive-thru in Bedhampton, Hampshire.
