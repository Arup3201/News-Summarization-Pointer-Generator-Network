Brendan Rodgers has described the collapse of Loic Remy’s move as “unfortunate” but insisted Liverpool will be sticking by their decision.

Liverpool had agreed personal terms after triggering a move with £8.5million bid for the France international and had even allocated a squad number for him but, at the last minute, they were forced to pull up stumps on the deal.

The club have not given a specific reason over why they have chosen such a course of action but Rodgers, speaking after Liverpool had beaten Olympiacos 1-0 at Soldier Field in Chicago, offered his opinion and insisted his sympathies were with Remy.

No deal: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, seen here at the end of his team's 1-0 win over Olympiacos in Chicago on Sunday night, described the collapse of an £8.5m move for Loic Remy as 'unfortunate'

He said: ‘It's very simple we have made a decision as a club not to go ahead with the deal. It's unfortunate for the player. We are disappointed for the player but there’s nothing more to be said and we will move on and look at other targets.’

If the news about Remy was difficult to take, Rodgers did have a boost on Sunday when Dejan Lovren’s £20million switch from Southampton was confirmed and the manager is hoping Lovren will fill the void in his back four that has been there since Jamie Carragher retired in May 2013.

Rodgers said: ‘He's right footed so he can play on the right but he prefers to play on the left. It will depend what needs must. The Important thing is that we have got the player and we will use him where we feel he needs to be. He’s a player who can still improve.

Confirmed: Rodgers was boosted by the completion of Dejan Lovren's £20m move from Southampton

‘I think Dejan is a really commanding central defender. I said since we lost Jamie Carragher we needed that leadership and he's a player who will gives us that. He's strong and can play. I was impressed by him when he was at Lyon and he was a big driving force for Southampton.’

Lovren will join up on Liverpool’s United States tour either in New York or Charlotte after agreeing a five-year contract and Rodgers believes his squad is now taking shape – and he is no longer mourning the sale of Luis Suarez.

‘I’m really pleased with how it's all coming along,’ said Rodgers, who should see Divock Origi become a Liverpool player in the next 24 hours, having agreed a £10million deal with Lille. ‘Our World Cup players have just come back.

‘We have only just been together as a squad over the last week or so. I know the group well and I know those coming in will fit what we're trying to do. When the Southampton game (at Anfield on August 17) comes up, we will be ready for that.'

Of the performance against Olympiakos, Rodgers added: ‘I was delighted with the team. As pre-season goes well, we will be getting sharper in our movements and passing but, at this time, we are building up the resistance of players and getting minutes under the belt.

‘In the first half, our passing was crisp and precise. We looked real threat at top end of the field. I was also very pleased with how we defended. We are in good shape and I am delighted.’
