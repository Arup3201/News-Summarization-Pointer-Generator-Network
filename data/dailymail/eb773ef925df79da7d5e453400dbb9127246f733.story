Dramatic images have revealed a fiery crash scene after a car allegedly fled from a drive-by shooting and smashed into several vehicles, causing an eight-car pile up and killing one innocent bystander.

Police are now hunting for the driver of
the vehicle - a Pontiac - after he fled the crash scene in South Los Angeles

Moments before the crash, someone in the Pontiac allegedly opened fire at a carwash and the car fled. Witnesses to the shooting jumped into another vehicle, a black Dodge Charger, in pursuit.

Aftermath: A car was allegedly speeding from a drive-by shooting when it crashed into another vehicle

Minutes later, both vehicles ran a red light, began driving south in a northbound lane and slammed into cross-traffic, causing the pile up, police told the Los Angeles Times.

As destroyed and smouldering vehicles blocked the junction of Manchester Avenue and Broadway, six people were taken to hospital, including a cyclist who was knocked to the ground.

Victim: Jose Cuevas died as the Pontiac struck his car on Tuesday - a day before he turned 40

One man,  Jose Cuevas, was pronounced dead after the Pontiac slammed into his silver Saturn. Mr Cuevas would have celebrated his 40th birthday on Wednesday.

The crash came after someone opened fire at a carwash fundraiser in South Los Angeles shortly before 8 p.m. Tuesday, Los Angeles Police Officer Lyle Knight said.

Nobody was hit and the silver Pontiac fled the scene. Witnesses or victims then jumped into a Dodge Charger and began chasing the vehicle before the crash.

While the Pontiac hit Cuevas' car, the Charger plowed into a pickup truck, which struck two parked cars and the bicyclist. At least two other cars were then hit.

'We were trying to make a left turn... All of a sudden, everybody’s hitting everybody – bam, bam, bam, bam, bam,' witness Dwight Thomas told NBC Los Angeles. 'It hit us, too. It just happened so fast.'

The Charger's driver is in critical condition, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Authorities said one of the passengers in the vehicle fled but was later caught by police and interviewed.

Initial reports had suggested that the crash could have been the result of street racing between the Pontiac and the Charger.
