Another day equals another smart dress coat for racing fan Zara Phillips, who chose a navy jacket for her third visit this week to Prestbury Park.

While Pippa Middleton was dazzling her very eligible friend with a bright banana yellow coat at one end of the Cheltenham course, young royal Zara chose a rather more sombre outfit for the day teaming her belted mac with a khaki green headpiece by milliner Karen Henriksen and some sensible looking brogues.

The Queen's granddaughter brightened up her country chic outfit with a cute giraffe print clutch bag and a pair of designer sunglasses by fashion favourite Tom Ford.

This racing season Zara has been showing off a new more grown-up style, choosing elegant knee-length coats to fend off the Gloucestershire chill, which has reached as low as -0.5C.

Today's coat featured an interesting handkerchief hem and deep funnel-necked collar that can be worn around the face when the temperatures really dip.

Like Pippa, 31-year-old Zara chose opaque brown tights to finish off the outfit, which until now have been seen as a major fashion faux-pas (perhaps this royal seal of approval can finally elevate them out of the style doldrums?).

Yesterday Zara wowed onlookers in a 
bright red wool coat by British designer Paul Costelloe as she paraded
around the track with a gaggle of girlfriends.

Day
two of the meet, Ladies Day, is traditionally the time for men and 
especially women to dress up and show off their new season style and 
although the freezing temperatures meant that the most glamorous outfits
were hidden underneath winter coats the rugby WAG and her friends - 
also known as the 'Scrummies' made sure they still had fun on their 
girls' day out.

Posing alongside Zara was Siobhan Brown, wife of Gloucester rugby player Alex Brown, who pulled faces for the camera and threw her arm around her royal friend and Zara's best friend and maid of honor Dolly Maude.

Just 24 hours earlier Zara has been 
photographed having a row with a security guard, who failed to recognise
her and tried to block her from crossing the parade ring while the 
horses passed but the horse-loving royal seemed to have put that 
embarrassment behind her today as she laughed and joked with friends.
