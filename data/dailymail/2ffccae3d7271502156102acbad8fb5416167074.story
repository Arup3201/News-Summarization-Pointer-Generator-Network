It's every child's fantasy - a night spent camped out in a massive IKEA showroom.

Single mum Brigid O'Connor's kids, Alice, 7, and Sophia, 10, had always wondered what it would be like to do just that.

Their dreams came true on Sunday evening when they were given the opportunity to hold a sleepover in the Swedish furniture giant's premier store in Tempe, in Sydney's south.

Peaceful slumber: Mum Brigid O'Connor and Sophia Foster, 10, and Alice Foster, 7, appeared to have enjoyed a relaxing evening in the Tempe IKEA showroom. Soft puppies were plopped into their laps as part of a 'surprise' wake-up call.

Lucky family: Sophia (10), Alice (7) and mum Brigid were given a surprise wake-up call - with soft puppies delivered straight to their laps.

Brigid O'Connor's daughters Sophie and Alice were 'thrilled to bits' to be shacked up in IKEA.

'They (my children) have always said since they were little, "imagine if we were locked in here overnight, we could run around, sleep on the beds, play with the toys, they always said that"', Ms O'Connor, 42, told Daily Mail Australia.

'I think it's something everyone imagines at some point'.

Along with two other lucky families, Ms O'Connor and her daughters, from Camperdown in the city's inner west, won a competition run by IKEA and travel rental company Airbnb to sleep in the warehouse.

Ms O'Connor's children bolted into the store to claim their bunk beds at around 5pm last night.

Her 'thrilled to bits' kids were given access to a games room featuring a Playstation, circus toys, juggling implements and craft supplies.

Ms O'Connor, who was shacked up in a bedroom display surrounded by a curtain, said it did not even feel like she was sleeping in a huge warehouse.

'The weirdest part is it didnâ€™t even feel like a shop,' she said. 'It was just like a really beautiful hotel room.'

The competition winners were treated to a communal Swedish meal in the centre of the store - a smorgasbord whipped up by chefs at the IKEA restaurant.

Dishes including the furniture chain's famous meatballs, a main of fresh salmon and a lemon tart dessert.

The families snuggled under thick Swedish bedspreads and security escorted them through the labyrinth store when they needed to go to the bathroom.

IKEA gave each family a different surprise wake-up call.

Sophie and Alice Foster were very excited to stay in Tempe's IKEA store, often known colloquially as the suburb's 'big blue box'.

Breakfast in bed: Three families staged an unusual sleep in at an IKEA store in Sydney last night. Pictured are Kimberley Ross, Robin Schrijvers and children Ella and Benjimen.

Welcome to IKEA: The Schrijvers family are served breakfast in bed at the IKEA showroom in Tempe, in Sydney's south-eastern suburbs.

Life as part of a showroom: One of the three families who joined in the festivities.

The Schrijvers family was roused with a scrumptious breakfast and bed. Another family - Heather Noakes, Gary Preuss and nine-year-old Nathan Gates - woke up serenaded by an orchestra.

And when Ms O'Connor's children woke they were given soft puppies to cuddle and pat.

'They were tiny little caramel gorgeous things,' she told Daily Mail Australia. The girls even asked if they could keep them.

Each family stayed in a room with a different design theme - rustic, modern elegance or inner-city living.

IKEA marketing manager Kristen Bengtsson said she hoped the sleepover would spotlight ways to make neglected bedrooms and bathrooms 'look fabulous'.

According to research produced by the company, homeowners often neglect their bedrooms and bathrooms the most.

The Swedish furniture giant has been in Australia since 1975. It has five stores on the east coast as well as two in Adelaide and Perth respectively.

Ms Bengtsson said IKEA was not planning to open up one of its stores for a mass sleepover - but 'never say never'.

Ms O'Connor, who even found the fluffy bathmats and hand towels in the bathroom impressive, said her stay at the store was like staying at a five star resort - with a catch.

'You didn't have to pay for the minibar.'
