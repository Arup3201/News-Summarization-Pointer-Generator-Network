Suella Fernandes came third in a hustings to replace Greg Barker as MP for Bexhill and Battle in rural Sussex

A high-flying Tory candidate was not selected partly because of the ‘double whammy of being brown and a woman’, a Conservative councillor has claimed.

Suella Fernandes came third in a hustings to replace Greg Barker as MP for Bexhill and Battle in rural Sussex.

John Barnes, a 77-year-old local councillor and president of the local association, said Ms Fernandes had put in a ‘wowzer performance on the night’. 

But he added that her gender and race had been a ‘handicap’ in such a strong field.

Mr Barnes said: ‘The double whammy of being brown and a woman probably handicaps her still.

‘I think if Suella was up against less strong opposition, it wouldn’t have been held against her but when you are battling three good men.

Party members in the constituency selected Huw Merriman, a local lawyer and councillor instead.

A Tory party spokesman said Mr Barnes’ comments were ‘unacceptable’.

He added: ‘They neither reflect the views of the Conservative party nor the reality, which is that people from all backgrounds are being selected to be candidates for the party.’

The remarks, to the Financial Times, expose the Tory party’s struggle to elect more ethnic minority and female candidates.

The party had just 11 black or Asian MPs — up from two in 2005 — and 48 women out of 303 Tory MPs.

Labour has 16 MPs from ethnic backgrounds and 86 women out if its 257 MPs.

David Cameron introduced a panel of controversial A-list candidates ahead of the 2010 election in a bid to push through more ethnic minority and female candidates.

But the party has dropped the scheme after an outcry from local associations.

Mr Barnes said Mr Cameron’s bid to change attitudes to women had been successful.

David Cameron, pictured at an awards ceremony last night, has attempted to increase the number of women and ethnic minority Tory MPs

He said: ‘It really is unthinkable if a woman is the best on the night, you wouldn’t pick her. That is coming with ethnicity but it is more likely to come in urban seats than rural seats.

‘And it is partly not about ethnicity, it is almost by definition [the case that] they know very little about countryside issues.’

The Tory party said that in the 28 constituencies where a sitting Conservative MP is retiring — typically the safest seats — nearly a third of the candidates selected are women and 18 per cent are from an ethnic minority.
