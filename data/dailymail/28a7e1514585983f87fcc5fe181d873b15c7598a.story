Joe Kinan lost his girlfriend and 40 per cent of his skin when The Station nightclub in West Warwick, Rhode Island caught fire during a concert in February 2003.

Kinan was the most injured survivor of the fire, with third and fourth degree burns covering nearly half of his body. He also lost his hands, ears, the sight in his left eye and much of his nose tissue. So far, he has had 120 surgeries.

While some would let such blows get the better of them - Kinan remained positive and that attitude has clearly paid off. At the World Burn Congress in Providence Rhode Island this week, Kinan announced that he had fallen in love with another burn victim, and that they are engaged.

Not alone: Kinan met his fiance Carrie Pratt at the World Burn Conference in Vancouver, Canada six years ago. Pratt was badly hurt by hot coffee as a young child

Initially devastated after his then-girlfriend died in the horrific nightclub blaze - one of 100 lives lost - Mr Kinan met his now-fiancée Carrie Pratt at the same event 6 years earlier while it was held in Vancouver, Canada.

Mr Pratt herself was badly burned by hot coffee when she was a young child.

The 44-year-old burn victim says it was at the conference that he first realized he 'wasn't alone.'

They first started out as friends, but eventually grew to be something more.

Aftermath: The fire at The Station nightclub was the fourth most deadly nightclub fire in U.S. history, killing 100

'She made me work for it at first. But she made it a lot easier for me to be open because she knew where I was coming from for the most part,' he told the Providence Journal.

Mr Kinan proposed to Ms Pratt a year ago, on the anniversary of their first meeting - just three days before he went into surgery to receive a hand transplant.

He spoke about the engagement during a session on the emotional challenge that burn victims face - such as overcoming self-esteem issues in dating.

Mr Kinan himself says he decided early on that he wouldn't let the fear of rejection keep him from trying to find love.

'Take me as I am or keep walking,' was his motto.
