She has been pivotal in Mulberry's success over the past six years but it was today announced that Emma Hill will be stepping down from her role as creative director for the British brand.

According to trade magazine WWD, the 42-year-old quit over 'disagreements with management over creative and operational strategy'.

British-born Ms Hill joined Mulberry in 2007 and was credited with turning the Somerset-based firm from a trusted briefcase and wallet maker into an international fashion powerhouse with a clutch of celebrity fans, including the Duchess of Cambridge.

Departure: Emma Hill has stepped down from her role as creative director of Mulberry

Magic: Hill with Alexa Chung, whose namesake bag became a global success

Profits soared as its Alexa and Del Rey 
designs (named after TV presenter Alexa Chung and singer Lana del Rey) 
were picked up by A-list stars around the world.

Last year Ms Hill was made a CBE for her services to British fashion.

She joined Mulberry after previously working on accessories at Burberry, Marc Jacobs and Gap. As she now moves on again, she is yet to comment on her reasons for leaving and what her next role will be.

A spokeswoman for the company declined to comment on the claim that Ms Hill had fallen out with the management.

In a statement the brand said: 'Mulberry confirms 
that Emma has informed the company that she wishes to leave after a very
successful period at Mulberry during which she has built a strong and 
talented creative team working for her.

'The timing of her departure is currently under discussion and has yet to be finalised.'

Honours: Hill was awarded a CBE in November last year

The company said its main spring/summer 
collection for 2014 had been completed and that Ms Hill was continuing 
to work in the business finalising the London Fashion Week collection to
be launched in September.

Ms Hill's departure comes after Bruno Guillon took over as chief executive a year ago. He said at the time that he wanted to work towards getting the 'right balance' between Mulberry’s long-term aspirations and its short-term performance.

Success: Hill's catwalk shows, held at London's Claridge's Hotel, became one of the most sought-after tickets of London Fashion Week

Seal of approval: U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour (centre, in sunglasses) attended the Mulberry A/W13 show at Claridge's last year - a sure sign Hill had made Mulberry relevant in the global market

However, Mulberry's profits have fallen in the last year and on Thursday it is expected to reveal it has been
hit by tougher markets in Asia and a post-Christmas fall in tourist 
spending.

Analysts expect pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March to fall to £26 million from last year's £36 million when results are announced later this week.

Investors' hopes that Mulberry can regain momentum after better results from other luxury goods brands may be hit by Ms Hill's departure.

Burberry recently posted improving profits and strong growth in emerging markets, driven by China, helping shares in Mulberry stage a modest recovery in recent weeks.
