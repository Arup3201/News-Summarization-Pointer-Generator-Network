Russian President Vladimir Putin is ‘terrified’ of growing old and has undergone a facelift to give him a ‘young, dynamic appearance’, according to a documentary.

The German programme also claims that the 62-year-old beat his former wife Lyudmila, and has ‘incredible delusions [of] control’ after surviving five assassination attempts in recent years.

Other more bizarre claims include how he sleeps in late and works only in the afternoon after breakfasting on cottage cheese.

He then takes hot and cold baths, followed by a session in a gym filled with expensive American sports equipment to hone his figure.

Biographer Ben Judah told the documentary: ‘Putin is afraid of physical decay, he is afraid of ageing.’

And a western intelligence report was cited alleging the Russian leader had a facelift in 2010.

But his meticulous approach to his appearance does not extend to his time-keeping.

The programme claims Putin is often late for appointments. ‘He even made the Queen of England wait for half an hour, his ministers often several hours,’ one Kremlin insider said. 

Putin The Man is being made by German TV company ZDF and tells how the boy from St Petersburg’s slums progressed to become a KGB spy.

But it seems he didn’t have an illustrious start to his career.

He was described as ‘lazy [and] drunken’ when he headed the KGB’s field office in Dresden in former East Germany between 1985 and 1990. 

One superior noted: ‘He was a desktop spy, a macho playing upon a safe stage.’ A file entry from the time reveals how he got inebriated at a friend’s birthday party.

The documentary included claims that he was prepared to shoot protesters during the peaceful revolution of 1989. Pictured are crowds attempting to get through the reopened Berlin Wall. File image used

It stated: ‘Mrs. H. remembers that on the birthday party of her father he grabbed her particularly fiercely, hugging and kissing her. His colleagues in the KGB spoke about his fondness for hard liquor.’

A source who was a KGB employee in Dresden and who befriended former Aeroflot stewardess Lyudmila, was said to have told superiors that Putin regularly beat his wife. The couple, who married in 1983 and have two daughters, divorced last year.

Putin also seems to have been careless in Dresden. A neighbour told the documentary how he once mislaid a bunch of keys to ultra sensitive KGB files – and posted a note on a tree seeking their rightful owner.
