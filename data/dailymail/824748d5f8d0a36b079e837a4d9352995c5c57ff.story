Looking bewildered, five penguins scuttle unsteadily across an ice rink in front of more than 150 screaming children.

The five were released to perform for the crowds as part of the launch of a pre-Christmas 'Ice Festival' at a shopping centre.

But last night the event's organisers were condemned after it emerged they are actually Humboldt penguins –  tropical birds which will never have seen ice before.

Onlookers said the birds, which 
usually nest on the warm Pacific coasts of Peru and Chile, spent much of
the ten-minute show falling over.

Professor Rory Wilson, of Swansea 
University, who has studied penguins for 32 years, said:  'Humboldts are
a tropical penguin used to a very warm climate in Chile and they will 
never, ever come across ice in their natural environment. If they looked
cold then they probably were.'

A spokesman for People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals said of the event at Liverpool's ONE shopping 
complex three weeks ago: 'This can only have left them petrified and 
disoriented.'

TV cameras rolled as a keeper tried to coax the birds with fish as they walked around the arena.

PETA, which has celebrity supporters including Mickey Rourke, Jessica Jane Clement and Pamela Anderson, slammed the event as ‘disrespectful, out of touch and tragic’.

This is unlike other species of penguin, such as the Emperor penguin, which enjoys the snow and ice and freezing conditions of the Antarctic.

A spokesperson from PETA said: ‘Anyone who has seen the beautiful film March of the Penguins would find this publicity stunt disrespectful, out of touch and tragic.

‘As the movie illustrates these fascinating birds have a rich and free life.

‘They do not deserve to be exploited as props, kept in tiny enclosures and denied all that is natural and familiar to them.

‘Forcing penguins to endure the stress of being hauled around and released onto a patch of ice in front of hordes of shoppers can only leave them petrified and disoriented.’

They added that penguins can transmit numerous diseases that can be harmful to pregnant women.

‘It is reckless and cruel to take Humboldt penguins or any animals and deliberately place them in a frightening and wholly unsuitable environment such as a tiny ice enclosure when they belong in the water and on the rocky islands off the coast of South America.’

Stephen Ware, a vet at Heythrop 
Zoological Gardens in Oxfordshire, which owns the penguins,  said: 'At 
no time have the penguins exhibited any distress in their surroundings.'

A spokesman for Liverpool ONE said: 'Liverpool ONE prides itself on only working with reputable suppliers, we have a robust process in place to ensure that the health and safety of our shoppers, staff and suppliers is always of paramount importance in everything we do.

'The company that brought the penguins to Liverpool ONE is held in high regard in their industry. They have worked with high profile entertainment and educational organisations on an international scale and are experts in their field.

'Based on expert advice we are confident that the welfare of the penguins was always their priority.'
