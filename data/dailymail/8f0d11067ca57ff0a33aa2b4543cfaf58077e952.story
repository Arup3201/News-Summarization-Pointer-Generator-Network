An eBay seller last night revealed her horror at accidentally including a naked view of herself when she posted a picture of a dress for sale on the website.

Aimi Jones, 21, hung the mustard yellow skater dress by ASOS on her wardrobe door to photograph it for listing.

But she failed to notice her own reflection in the door mirror, camera in hand, and in just a black bra and no knickers.

The post soon went viral and now the blunder has sparked a flurry of fake eBay sale ads for the yellow dress with fictional characters accidentally making an appearance.

Mirror, mirror: Aimi Jones, from Oxfordshire, did not realise she had captured herself half-naked in a mirror when she snapped the dress to sell on eBay

Bit more demure: She re-listed the item on eBay 
and this time covered up with a black coat. It has attracted bids of 
£153, 911 so far

One eBay user went to the added effort 
of posting several pictures featuring James McAvoy in his role as Mr 
Tumnus in the first Chronicles of Narnia film modelling the yellow dress

The original image and mock-ups have since been shared on Twitter with the hash tag #ebayyellowskaterdress.

Miss Jones, from Oxfordshire, told The Sun: 'It's so embarrassing. It is such a dizzy, stupid thing to do and now the whole world's seen me in the nude.

'I put it on eBay last Saturday morning and realised straight away so ended the sale. But what I didn't realise was that people could still it on the site.

'I reported it to eBay and they took it down, but by then it had gone viral. My boyfriend Andy thinks the whole thing is hilarious.'

Internet hit: Copycat hoaxers have posted their 
own versions of the original eBay blunder - but this joke ad featuring 
James McAvoy as Mr Tumnus in the first Chronicles of Narnia film only 
attracted a top bid of £9.50

A dress for all occasions: The eBay user also helpfully posted a selection of pics of Mr Tumnus showing the dress off in a variety of locations

The new listing read: 'Asos yellow skater dress size 10, 2nd time round!! a MUST HAVE!!

'As seen by thousands. Never worn naked. Needs a good home.'

Bizarrely the listing caused a stir among eBay users. Originally listed at £15.99, the dress has received more than 130 bids and reached more than £153,000.

The picture brought mixed reaction on internet forums. One user commented: 'It is a shocking dress'.

Miss Jones, who has the user ID 
sugart*t-2, relisted the dress with a similarly-posed picture but this 
time covered up in a dark Nike top.

Very versatile: It appears even fictional fauns can pull off the yellow skater dress with ease

Joker: Another hoax ad featured a slightly bigger seller reflected in the mirror but it didn't manage to attract any bids
