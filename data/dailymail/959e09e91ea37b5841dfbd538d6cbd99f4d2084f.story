Police have spoken to three men they were seeking in connection with an alleged racist incident involving Chelsea fans on a Paris Metro train.

Scotland Yard released images of the men they believed they were among a group of supporters who allegedly pushed a black man off the train and chanted a racist song in the French capital on Tuesday.

The incident happened ahead of Chelsea's Champions League clash with Paris St Germain, which ended 1-1.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the three men had now been identified and the force was liaising with the French authorities.

None of the men sought by Scotland Yard have been arrested.

A police spokesman said the force cannot arrest people for offences which happen outside the UK but 'a number of people' have now been spoken to in relation to the incident.

Footage posted online showed the commuter - named in reports as Souleymane S - being pushed back on to the platform amid chants of 'we're racist, we're racist and that's the way we like it'.
