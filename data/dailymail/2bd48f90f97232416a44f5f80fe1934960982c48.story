Just after making a plea to the public for donations to help with her appeals, Jodi Arias wants to fire her lead defense attorney, who she says has had no contact with her since a jury chose to convict her on first degree murder charges May 23.

Arias filed a handwritten motion in Maricopa County Arizona Superior Court on Tuesday asking that Kirk Nurmi be fired as her first attorney, citing his ‘utter poverty of people skills’ and lack of ‘tolerance for my emotional and psychological shortcomings.’

Meanwhile, the convicted killer's Twitter count sent out a plea Monday seeking donations to get 'Justice4Jodi.'

No love: Convicted murderer Jodi Arias filed a 12-page, hand-written request asking that she be allowed to fire her lead attorney Kirk Nurmi, who she also tried to fire in June

In the 12-page document to Judge Sherry 
Stephens , Arias says attorney Kirk Nurmi hasn't seen her since jurors 
in her sensational murder trial reached an impasse on whether to 
sentence her to life in prison or death for killing her boyfriend Travis
Alexander in 2008.

Arias also tried to fire him in June, but Judge Stephens did not grant her request.

Among other examples in her exhaustive plea, Arias writes that Nurmi failed her when private conversations between her and Alexander were played in open court despite her desire for the cameras to be kept out.

Arias has only positive feelings for her second chair attorney Jennifer Willmott.

Support: Jodi Arias was often seen beside second-chair attorney Jennifer Willmott in court. In her plea to fire Nurmi, Arias gave Wilmott glowing reviews and said the female attorney has done most of the work in the case

Arias writes that Willmott, the brunette woman so often seen right at Arias’ side throughout her trial, picked up much of Nurmi’s slack and bore the majority of the work in the case.

The Arizona Republic notes that, as part of his closing arguments, Nurmi argued ‘it’s not even about whether or not you like Jodi Arias. Nine days out of 10, I don’t like Jodi Arias…’

Nurmi could not be reached for comment about his feelings on Arias’ most recent filing.

According to HLN, Arias' friend Donavan Bering said he runs the account , which now boasts nearly 80,000 followers.

'Donations are now being accepted for my appeals at Justice4Jodi.com,' the account tweeted October 23.

According to the site Justice 4 Jodi, the money will go toward 'payments of the beneficiary's legal expenses related to the appeals of her pending criminal case, including, without limitation, attorney fees, investigator fees, expert-witness fees and transcript filing fees.'

Arias tweeted through her intermediary that she would like to file for bankruptcy.

Arias has another hearing to decide whether she lives or dies scheduled for November 1.

Arias was convicted of first-degree murder on May 8 in the 2008 death of boyfriend Travis Alexander in his suburban Phoenix home. The same jury failed to reach a decision on whether she should get the death penalty and prosecutors want a new jury to consider the same question.

Arias claimed the killing was self-defense. Prosecutors argued it was premeditated murder.
