Resignation: David Nieland, a former Homeland Security agent, allegedly paid a prostitute for sex

The investigator who led Homeland Security's internal review of how the 2012 Secret Service prostitution scandal was handled has himself quit after he was reportedly spotted with a hooker.

Sheriff's deputies in Broward County, Florida saw David Nieland entering and leaving a building that was under surveillance in a different prostitution investigation, officials told the New York Times.

Authorities later interviewed the prostitute and she identified a photograph of Nieland and said he had paid her for sex, the officials said.

Nieland resigned in August after he refused to answer questions from the Department of Homeland Security about the incident. A DHS spokesperson said they became aware of the incident in May.

Nieland has not been charged. Facebook posts suggest he is a married father.

It is not the first twist in the tale that has featured Nieland.

The investigator, who was the head of the inspector general's Miami office, had been called in to review the 2012 investigation. Following the scandal, nine agents left the agency after it emerged that they had prostitutes in their rooms while in Cartagena, Colombia for a visit by President Obama.

But after the probe, it emerged that Nieland told congressional staffers that he had been pressured to cover up the fact that a White House volunteer also had a prostitute in his room. 

New scandal: Nieland, pictured with an unidentified woman, denied the allegations to the New York Times and has not been charged. He resigned after he refused to answer questions about the incident

Earlier this month, the volunteer was named as Jonathan Dach, 28, by the Washington Post. At the time, he was just 25 and a Yale University law student, but he now works for the State Department in the Secretary's Office of Global Women's Issues. 

Nieland said he had been asked to delete the derogatory information from the 65-page public report, which was issued in September 2012, because it was potentially damaging to the administration just two months before the November election.

He said that when he and his colleagues questioned how the investigation was being handled, they were placed on administrative leave and removed from the report's chain of command. 

The congressional staffers  said that no evidence supported his allegation and the volunteer was never charged. The White House also said it had not intervened in the report's preparation.

Nieland has said that the prostitution allegation 'is not true' and declined to answer any questions, the New York Times reported. 

Probe: In 2012, he investigated how the Secret Service prostitution scandal had been handled. Nine agents were fired or left the agency after it emerged prostitutes had been in their rooms in this Colombia hotel

Questions: Nieland said he had been told to keep it quiet that White House volunteer Jonathan Dach (right with his family and President Obama) also had a prostitute in his room. The White House has denied this

He resigned on August 9, citing health problems, and later sent a tweet that his government career had ended. In August, he also thanked people on Twitter for their support about his 'retirement'.

A Homeland Security Department spokesman, William O. Hillburg, confirmed to the Times that Nieland had resigned and that officials had become aware of an incident in Florida that involved one of its employees. Under law, no comment could be offered on a specific case, Hillburg said.

Thirteen Secret Service agents and officers were implicated in a prostitution scandal that arose from preparations for Obama's trip in April 2012 to the seaside resort of Cartagena.

They were accused of carousing with female foreign nationals at a hotel where they were staying before Obama's arrival. Nine of the officers and agents eventually left the agency - resigned, forced out or retired.
