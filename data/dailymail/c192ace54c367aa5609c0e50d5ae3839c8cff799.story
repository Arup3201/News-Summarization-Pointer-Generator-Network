She is the faceless Australian criminal who was spared from execution back in the 1800s despite murdering her two youngest children and stabbing four others before they escaped.

The incredible details of Martha Rumph's history has until now remained scarce with her family doing everything in their power to erase the shame of her crimes by destroying all records and photos. 

But a descendant has remarkably managed to piece together elements of Martha's twisted story and unravel further drama that plagued the Rumph family almost 150 years ago. 

Martha Rumph was committed to The Hospital for the Insane (pictured) at Gladesville, north-west of Sydney, in March 1894 several years after murdering two of her young daughters and stabbing four others

Martha, who emigrated to Australia with her husband Michael and son George from Germany in 1856, lived in the Snowy Mountains region of NSW and gave birth to six more children in the years to follow.

She brutally murdered her two youngest children - two-year-old Elizabeth and seven-month-old Wilhelmina - on January 11, 1871.

Martha stabbed four of her other children, Mary, 10, Annie, 7, William, 6, and Martin 4, before they managed to escape and run for their father who worked as a shepherd on a squatting run.

When her husband arrived at the scene, he found Martha lying in their bed with their two dead daughters and a butcher's knife.

Martha stabbed four of her other children, Mary, 10, Annie, 7, William, 6 (pictured here later as a school teacher), and Martin 4, before they managed to escape and run for their father

The death certificates of Elizabeth and Wilhelmina Rumph were uncovered during a general family history search some 20 years ago and led descendant and Ancestry member Patricia Moon to uncover the gruesome story. 

At Martha's murder trial at Darlinghurst in Sydney on February 16, 1871, medical experts argued that she was suffering from puerperal mania - a psychic condition that affects women after the birth of a baby.

Members of her tight-knit community rallied in support of Martha saying she should be treated in an asylum and not jail because she must have been in a trance-like state when she murdered her daughters.

'She was found not guilty on the grounds of insanity. She would have been hanged if she had been found guilty in those days,' Ms Moon told Daily Mail Australia.   

'That’s the incredible part of it, she was sort of forgiven by the community, the judge, the government, her family – if she had been found guilty, that would have been it.'

While Martha was freed from jail three years after the murder, she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital at Gladesville in March 1894 where patients were often strapped into straighjackets (pictured)

Hospital records showed Martha was confined to a single room because other patients didn't want to sleep with her due to homicidal attempts. Doctors said she was delusional and would talk to herself

Martha lived out the rest of her life in asylums. She was initially placed at The Hospital for the Insane at Gladesville (pictured) before being moved to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney

She was later transferred to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney, where she died of Bright's disease on April 26, 1902. Martha's grave is among the 1,200 psychiatric patients buried within the hospital grounds

There are no photos of Martha after her granddaughter, Minnie Hare, left orders in her will in 1951 to destroy any information or photos Martha appeared in to try and erase the shame

Martha was deemed sane three years later and was sent back home. 

The Rumph's run of bad luck continued when she returned after her eldest son George was kicked in the head by a horse and died when he was 21.

Martha's daughter Annie, who survived the stabbing, was also found dead in 1884 when she was just 19.

'She took a job as a servant on some property down in Bega. One of the men on the property seduced her and told her he would marry her,' Ms Moon said.

'She got pregnant and then he refused her. She left her saddle and a note on the side of a  river and drowned herself.

'The doctor who did the autopsy said they knew who she was because she had a slit across her throat from where her mother had cut her.

'They found a six-month-old foetus inside her.'

The Rumph's run of bad luck continued when Martha's daughter Annie, who survived the stabbing, committed suicide in 1884. She threw herself in the Bega (pictured) river after falling pregnant to a man she worked for

The doctor who did the autopsy on Annie said they knew who she was because she had a list across her throat from where her mother had tried to cut her

Up until 1894, Martha had managed to maintain her relationships with her family despite her crimes some 20 years before.

But when she had another manic episode and attacked her nephew with a fork, Martha was sent to The Hospital for the Insane at Gladesville, north-west of Sydney, in March 1894.

Hospital records show Martha was confined to a single room because other patients didn't want to sleep with her due to homicidal attempts. Doctors said she was delusional and would talk to herself.  

Martha lived out the rest of her life in asylums. 

She was later transferred to Kenmore Hospital, south of Sydney, where she died of Bright's disease on April 26, 1902.

Only three of Martha's children lived on into adulthood, including William (pictured here with his children) who was just six years old when his mother tried to slash his throat

The death certificates of Martha's two children that she murdered in 1871 identified that their throats had been slit by their mother

The death certificates of Elizabeth and Wilhelmina Rumph were uncovered during a general family history search some 20 years ago and led to the gruesome story being uncovered

Martha's grave is among the 1,200 psychiatric patients buried within the hospital grounds. 

Ms Moon spent years trawling through records and old newspaper clippings to piece together Martha's story. 

'This is all sort of hidden in history,' she said. 'She fell through the cracks. The family didn't ever speak about it.'

Her granddaughter, Minnie Hare, left orders in her will in 1951 to destroy any information or photos Martha appeared in to try and erase the shame.  

The family of Martin Rumph, one of Martha's three children to survive, still live on the family property in the Snowy Mountains region.

Martha Rumph’s records are now available in Ancestry’s Asylum and Gaol record collection.
