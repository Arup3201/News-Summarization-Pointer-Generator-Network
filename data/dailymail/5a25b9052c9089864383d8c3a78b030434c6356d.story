Jailed: Gareth Mason slit his ex-girlfriend's throat and killed her new boyfriend in a night-time ambush at a caravan park in Heysham, Lancashire

A father has been jailed for life after slitting his ex-girlfriend's throat and killing her new boyfriend in a night-time ambush. 

Gareth Mason, 26, tracked down Katrina Rudrum and her new partner Adam Stirrup to a caravan park in Heysham, Lancashire.

He stabbed the mother of his son in the chest and back, before cutting her throat with a kitchen knife.

He then killed 28-year-old Mr Stirrup by stabbing him in the chest, neck, face, arms and hands.

Miss Rudrum, 26, and her boyfriend had been trying to keep their address a secret from Mason, Preston Crown Court heard.

However, the father of one managed to track down the couple to Stud Holme Farm Holiday Park after scouring caravan sites in the area.

He then crept around on the roof of their caravan in the early hours of August 4, before forcing his way into the vehicle and launching the frenzied stabbing attack.

Louise Blackwell QC, prosecuting, said: 'Miss Rudrum believed she was being punched in the face, but he was stabbing her with a knife.

'She felt the warmth of her own blood and realised she must have been stabbed.'

During the assault, Mason pinned his ex-girlfriend's arms behind her back and slit her throat with the knife.

However, despite her horrific injuries, Miss Rudrum managed to shield Mr 
Stirrup's 13-year-old daughter - who was also staying in the caravan - from Mason, before collapsing.

Miss Blackwell said that a number of 
neighbours had heard 'blood curdling' female screams coming from the caravan - with one witness 
hearing a woman say 'no no oh god' followed by a male voice saying 'come back
 you silly f***ing bitch'.

She said Mason - who has a three-year-old son with Miss Rudrum - had then stabbed Mr Stirrup numerous times, before throwing the knife over a fence and fleeing the scene.

Mr Stirrup, a bus driver, was taken to hospital after staggering to a nearby caravan park, but later died from multiple wounds to his lungs and abdomen.

Following the attack, Mason called
 his mother in Stoke-on-Trent and told her to immediately collect him 
from his home in Morecambe because 'something was badly wrong', the 
court heard.

His mother then drove him and his three-year-old son
 to her home, where he was later found by 
police hiding in the toilet.

Yesterday, Mason, of Westminster 
Road, pleaded guilty to murder and wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.

Miss Blackwell said Mason and Miss Rudrum had been in a violent, 'on-off' 
relationship before they broke up.

In
 March 2012, Mason was sentenced to a community order after he admitted 
two counts of battery over a series of violent acts against Miss Rudrum, including strangulation, banging her head and dropping furniture on her.

Miss Blackwell said: 'Certainly by the summer of the last year Katrina Rudrum wanted 
to leave the defendant but it seemed the defendant was incapable of 
letting her go.'

She said Mason had bombarded his ex-lover with unreturned phone calls and text 
messages in the hours leading up to the attack - with his last text reading: 'Are you ignoring me because you are with him?'

He had then gone home to collect the knife
 before heading to the caravan site where Miss Rudrum and her new 
partner lived.  

When interviewed by police, Mason initially denied he was at the holiday park - however, he later confessed to both stabbings.

He
 claimed he had collected the knife to slash the caravan's tyres, but had 'lost it' when the couple came outside after 
hearing noises.

'I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t go round there to stab him. I just lost it and then that’s it,' he told police.

In a victim impact statement, Mr Stirrup’s mother Gail described her son as a 'good, honest and nice guy' who would 'give anything to his family'.

'He always thought of others before himself,' she said. 'We are devastated by our loss.'

Although Miss Rudrum has been left with permanent scars following the attack, she has made a 'sterling effort to try and 
recover some semblance of her life', said Miss Blackwell.

However, she is on anti-depressants, has
 lost her job and does not feel safe.

Sentencing
 Mason to life, with a minimum of 24 years, Judge Stuart Baker told him he had committed 'two dreadful acts'.

'The death of Mr Stirrup at your hands was truly an appalling waste of life,' he added.
