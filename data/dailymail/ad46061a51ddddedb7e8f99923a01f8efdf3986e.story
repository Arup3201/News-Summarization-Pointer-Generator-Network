The BBC will use this year's Children in Need to address the Jimmy Savile scandal - but will not mention the disgraced presenter by name.

BBC executives will be keeping a close eye on the public response to its flagship annual charity fundraising programme which airs on Friday.

The appeal is likely to be seen as a test of support for the corporation in light of the successive scandals that have rocked it over the past six weeks.

Sir Terry Wogan will once again present the show, which last year raised a record £46million.

The Savile revelations and the fallout from the shelved Newsnight report about the late Jim'll Fix It star will inevitably cast a shadow over this year's six-hour fundraiser on BBC1 and BBC2.

The BBC said the programme would be 'even bigger and better than ever' with guests including Girls Aloud, One Direction, Olympics and Paralympics stars and Sir Alan Sugar, who will appear in a special edition of EastEnders.

BBC sources told The Guardian the programme would make reference to 'recent events that have been covered in the press' but it is not expected to specifically mention Savile.

The appeal will also carry a film reflecting the work of charities that help the victims of abuse.

'There will be some kind of reference to recent events that have been covered in the Press quite extensively,' said a BBC insider. 'It will also say that Children in Need does and always has supported children who were the victims of abuse and will continue to support the amazing work that these charities do.

Scandal: Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 1987 and 1989

'There will be a film to reflect that, and there was one on the same subject last year.'

Sir Roger Jones, the former chairman of Children in Need, revealed last month that Savile was secretly banned from the Children in Need appeal for being ‘creepy’.

Though
still revered elsewhere at the corporation, the presenter was kept away
from the annual fundraiser because of 'rumours' of his interest in 
young girls.

Savile appeared on the telethon in 1984, 
1987 and 1989, before Sir Roger became chairman. A member of the board 
of governors between 1996 and 2002, Sir Roger said he would have stepped
down from his charity role if Savile had become involved.

The BBC has also suffered a slump in trust among licence-fee payers as a result of the Savile scandal and the ensuing crisis over an inaccurate Newsnight report about an alleged child abuser, which led to the resignation of director general George Entwistle on Saturday.

The former judge who is leading a BBC inquiry into the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal has launched an appeal for witnesses.

Dame Janet Smith, who is reviewing the corporation's practices during the Savile years, has called on potential victims, witnesses, people who worked with the TV presenter and senior staff at the time to assist with the investigation.

According to the inquiry's website, the review also wants to hear from people 'who were familiar with the culture or practices of the BBC' in terms of 'preventing or enabling the sexual abuse of children, young people or teenagers'.

Savile became hugely famous during the 1960s and 1970s as a BBC Radio 1 DJ and presenter of Jim'll Fix It on BBC1.

He worked for the BBC between 1964 and approximately 2007, according to the review's website.

But Savile, who died last year at the age of 84, is now believed to have been one of the UK's most prolific abusers, with hundreds of possible victims.

A YouGov poll published on Tuesday 
found that for the first time since it began tracking support for 
British institutions in 2003, more respondents distrust BBC journalists 
(47 per cent) than trust them (44 per cent).

YouGov
reported a slump of 13 percentage points in trust in BBC journalism the
past fortnight – suggesting the corporation's reputation has been 
harmed more by the inaccurate Newsnight report and Entwistle's 
resignation than by earlier revelations about Savile.

BBC insiders said Savile would be the 'elephant in the room' during this year's appeal, but people working on the show stressed that it would be 'business as usual to make the very best programme we can make so the viewers really enjoy it'.

A former chairman of Children In Need, Sir Roger Jones, said last month that the charity had made a decision to keep Savile away from the event because he had suspicions about the Top of the Pops presenter.

Jones, a former BBC governor for Wales, said he always felt Savile was a 'pretty creepy sort of character … we took the decision that we didn't want him anywhere near the charity and we just stepped up our child protection policies ,which again would have put him at risk if he tried anything'.

Wogan will be joined by BBC presenters Fearne Cotton, Tess Daly and new Radio 1 breakfast DJ Nick Grimshaw. This year's appeal will be executive produced by Clare Pizey.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Our aim this year, like every year, is to raise as much money as possible and we are on track to raise millions to help change lives of disadvantaged children across the UK.

'BBC Children in Need has a strong track record of funding projects with a specific focus on supporting children and young people who are at risk of, or have experienced, some form of sexual abuse.

'On Friday night, the show will feature a number of films based on the work we fund to help disadvantaged children and young people in the UK, this will include some of our work helping the victims of sexual abuse, as was the case last year.'

Last year's Children in Need, featuring bandaged mascot Pudsey Bear, raised £46million, taking to more than £650million the amount of money it has generated since its first broadcast in 1980.

Girls Aloud have recorded this year's Children In Need single, Something New. Friday night's programme will also feature special editions of Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear and Doctor Who, and Pudsey the dog, winner of ITV1's Britain's Got Talent, meeting his Children In Need namesake.
