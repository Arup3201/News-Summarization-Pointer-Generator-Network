Budget cuts: Leicestershire Police is to stop its neighbourhood police officers from investigating crimes in a move it hopes with save money

A police force is saving money by telling more than 150 of its beat bobbies to stop investigating crimes.

Officers in Leicestershire will no longer be expected to pursue inquiries, go out on raids or attend incidents.

Instead they will spend their time chatting to members of the public while on patrol and tackling low-level antisocial behaviour.

Their chief constable insisted the radical changes are in response to public demand and pressures on limited resources. 

But the move provoked a furious backlash last night amid fears it will simply lead to more criminals 'getting away with it'.

Labour MP Ian Austin, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: 'When a crime is committed, people want a police officer to investigate and the guilty people found, charged, taken to court and punished.

'Giving advice on not becoming a victim of crime is obviously important, but surely the police's number one job is to catch criminals so they can be convicted. We have got to be wary of anything which gives the public the impression that fewer crimes will be investigated.'

Under the changes which come into force today, 155 beat bobbies will be rebranded 'Dedicated Neighbourhood Officers'. They will tackle low-level antisocial behaviour such as vandalism and nuisance _neighbours and give crime-prevention advice. But they will not be expected to probe crimes, which will instead be passed on to a new 'force investigation unit'.

According to Leicestershire Chief Constable Simon Cole, this will make the officers 'more visible on the streets'. He said: 'This way of working will allow the teams in our communities to dedicate their time to working closely with neighbourhoods and partners to resolve issues at a local level.'

Leicestershire Police added: 'Beat officers will be known as Dedicated Neighbourhood Officers to reflect a change in role that is solely focused on working with communities.

'They will no longer routinely carry out duties such as crime investigation, planned arrests and attending incidents – these will be dealt with by other specialist units.'

The move is intended to plug a gap as Leicestershire Police axes 300 of its 2,200 officer posts over the next two years in a bid to save some £10million. Its progress will be watched closely by senior officers in every other force in the country who are desperate to find ways of cutting costs.

But there are also concerns that the scheme could see crimes fall through the cracks if they do not come with promising leads or are not deemed serious enough for other officers to pursue.

One source said: 'Officers will hate this because no one wants to be told to leave something to others who are 'better at investigating'. It's difficult to see why officers at the scene or with victims of crime cannot use the huge amount of training they receive to kick-start an investigation.'

It is not the first time Leicestershire Police, which has a budget of £172million, has encountered controversy.

It was castigated for failing Fiona Pilkington, who killed herself and her disabled daughter in 2007 after suffering months of harassment at her home near Hinckley. After their deaths an independent inquiry found she had complained to police 33 times.

Two years ago, residents expressed disbelief after officers spent hours hanging knitted pom-poms from trees. Householders had said they wanted more street lighting and CCTV, but in a move dubbed the 'worst crime-fighting idea ever', in a bid to 'reduce the fear of crime' police responded with the fluffy balls.

But all police forces, including the Met, have had to shake up their local units to stretch resources and meet demand.

Labour's police spokesman Jack Dromey said senior officers were 'masking' cuts by keeping police on the beat while slashing the number solving crimes.

He said: 'The public will be rightly concerned that these cuts mean more criminals getting away with it.'

A Leicestershire Police spokesman said: 'These changes have saved £10million. The force has remodelled how policing is delivered to provide the best possible service with the budget available.' 

The number of traffic police has fallen by almost a quarter in the past five years as speed cameras proliferate.

There are 1,279 fewer officers patrolling highways – a 23 per cent drop, the RAC says. Some forces have cut their traffic police by more than three-quarters.

The fall also coincides with a rise in road deaths and serious injuries – reversing years of falling casualty rates.

The latest digital cameras can spot speeders across all the lanes of a motorway.

But while the cameras are catching motorists at just a few miles over the limit, a lack of police using their eyes and experience means many potentially life-threatening offences that speed cameras cannot spot are going undetected and unpunished. These include those who text at the wheel, tail-gaters and aggressive drivers.

The slashing of traffic police in England and Wales – the equivalent of five fewer officers a week – was revealed in response to a parliamentary question and analysed by the RAC. Devon and Cornwall police cut its traffic police by 76 per cent – from 239 to 57.
