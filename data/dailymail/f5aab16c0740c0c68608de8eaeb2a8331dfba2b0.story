An incredible video shows the moment a tiger jumps at its trainer while his back is turned.

Louisiana State University mascot Mike the Tiger VI is filmed poised and ready to spring as his trainer, Jeff, crouches down and looks over his shoulder at him.

The minute Jeff turns around, the big cat leaps at him from the other side of a two-metre wide moat.

Luckily, Jeff is protected by thick glass surrounding Mike's enclosure but the power of the huge animal is clear.

People watching the enclosure shout in amazement as the tiger comes within an inch of the bystanders.

The tiger then wades through the water and jumps up at the glass as Jeff stands up and puts his hands out.

Since the video was uploaded to college newspaper The Daily Reveille's website, it has had 470,000 views.

Mike the Tiger weighs 226kg and is known for his confidence and inquisitiveness.

The eight-year-old big cat has one of the largest tiger habitats in the United States and is well known for being friendly to humans.
