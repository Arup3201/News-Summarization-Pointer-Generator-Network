RIATH AL-SAMARRAI: Jack Wilshere has huge potential and talent, but the Arsenal midfielder risks seeing his career go up in smoke

Jack Wilshere appeared to hit back at his critics after becoming embroiled in another smoking controversy.

Photos of the midfielder holding a shisha pipe at a nightclub were posted on social media and quickly made national headlines.

On Thursday evening, Wilshere posted on Instagram a video of himself in training as he recovers from ankle surgery along with the message: 'Worry about your character not your reputation, because your character is who you are and your reputation is only what people who don't know you think about you!'

The Gunners are to seek clarification from Wilshere over the circumstances of the incident, which is understood to have happened during a night out with friends in central London last week.

A picture of Wilshere was uploaded to Instagram, before being removed and replaced with an edited version where only the face of the Arsenal player was visible in the background.

However, the original image, where the England international held the shisha pipe, was then subsequently reposted on Twitter, sparking much debate across social media over the player's behaviour ahead of Saturday's north London derby at Tottenham.

Arsenal take a dim view on players smoking.

In January, goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was hit with a £25,000 fine after it emerged he lit up in the showers following the 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day, since when the Pole has not started a Barclays Premier League match.

Speaking in July after a previous incident, Wilshere said: 'The smoking? Of course I regret it. I have been seen before doing it. I said then I made a mistake and I have made a mistake again. People make mistakes.

Jack Wilshere has once again made the headlines for the wrong reasons. When is he going to realise his place in the Arsenal team is under serious threat and start acting like a professional? Robert B, Fife

Surely it's time to start educating Jack and have somebody explain to him how to behave. If he was smoking that pipe, even if it doesn't do him any serious damage as a player I wouldn't put myself in that position. The goalkeeper has already lost his place over a smoking issue so you would never dream of being seen with anything – cigarette, shisha, lager, anything. Being in the team means so much to you and is such a reward for your efforts that it's not worth that risk. He is obviously going out and thinks he is in a private situation but you never are as a footballer, there is always somebody on the lookout. You have to be squeaky clean and if you are serious about your football that's how you should want to live anyway.

News of Wilshere's smoking is bound to infuriate manager Arsene Wenger yet again

Shisha or hooka pipes are a way of smoking tobacco, usually mixed with fruit or molasses sugar, through a bowl and hose or tube 

'I am young and I will learn from it. I realise the consequences it has and the effect on kids growing up.

'I have kids myself and I don't want them growing up to think their dad smokes and it is okay for a footballer to smoke, because it's not.

'It is unacceptable and I will accept the consequences and I will move on.'
