Where do England go from here? Stuart Lancaster’s team still face unanswered questions less than 10 months out from the World Cup and defeat next week against Australia would complete a hat-trick of losses to the Southern Hemisphere super powers. 

Clive Woodward’s team began their World Cup countdown with famous wins over New Zealand, Australia and South Africa on successive weekends but Lancaster’s team appear miles behind.

Here Sam Peters speaks to series of former players and coaches to get their take on where England must learn and improve if they want to be contenders at next year’s tournament.

Take the chances presented to you

England’s driving maul and set-piece play has been very effective but they are not using that ball anywhere near wisely enough. The frustrating thing is that England have created chances against South Africa and New Zealand, but have not taken them. I’m thinking of Mike Brown’s dropped pass against New Zealand and Dave Attwood not straightening and giving a pass against South Africa. Those moments make or break you at the highest level.

Attack the gainline

If you watch New Zealand closely then you’ll see how many times a forward carries the ball up at first receiver before off-loading out of the tackle to a second runner on their shoulder. It may only take them two or three metres past the gainline but it means they always have quick ball. At the moment England’s runners are on their own and getting isolated. That means slow ball. They have to work on that area because if we can generate quick ball there are exciting runners who can thrive on it.

Back-row needs competition

I would have liked to have seen a different player at No 7 against Samoa because we need to know what someone like Matt Kvesic, Luke Wallace or Will Fraser can do in that key position. If Chris Robshaw gets injured then there is no obvious replacement in that position. Steffon Armitage is also a player I’d be pulling all the stops out to get involved ahead of the World Cup. At the moment England’s back row feels a bit predictable and I’d like to see some other players being given an opportunity in that area. Ultimately we know what players like James Haskell can do. I understand why they’ve picked him but there are other players out there England need to learn about.

Beat Australia

It’s not all doom and gloom with this England team. Lancaster will have learned a lot about his players in this series — not all of it good — and will have a clearer idea about which players can survive at the highest level. But they have to start winning soon, starting with Australia next week, because otherwise the rot can set in very quickly.

Build on the set piece

England will always produce yeomen for the team to build a platform off, but at the moment England are wasting their hard-earned set-piece possession. Despite injuries to guys like Dan Cole and Joe Launchbury, the pack is still rock solid so why on earth aren’t the backs doing anything when they have it?

Breakdown — bring back Armitage

I watched the South Africa game alongside Zinzan Brooke and Neil Back and I can tell you they were tearing their hair out at the lack of balance in England’s back row. Robshaw is a fine workhorse but he is out of position at No 7 and England’s breakdown work is suffering as a result.

In Armitage England have one of the best openside flankers in the world, but he’s kicking his heels in France because of this selection ruling. Stuart Lancaster — who I’m a big admirer of by the way — has to change his policy on this or England will never produce the quick ball they crave.

The Farrell conundrum

I’m sorry but it really does seem to be one rule for one and one rule for another in terms of selection at the moment. Danny Care has a couple of bad games and is booted out of the squad while Owen Farrell — who is patently not fit — is just as bad but gets shifted to inside centre. Am I missing something here? For me, Farrell is not even the best attacking fly-half at his club, where Charlie Hodgson is superb, and he is very fortunate to get another go at inside centre. I hope that midfield combination works, but I fear Farrell is just too functional where England need creativity and world-class distribution.

The need for speed

If England are going to pick Farrell they have to have speed everywhere around him and at the moment that is not the case. Brad Barritt is another trusted workhorse but where is the searing pace that England’s midfield and wingers should provide. I don’t understand why Jonathan Joseph doesn’t get a look in. I’d have picked Bath’s midfield of Ford, Joseph and Kyle Eastmond for last night’s clash.

Width

England are simply not getting enough width on the ball and that is largely down to them not having played a ball-playing 12. I believe Farrell can do that job and I’m excited England have finally gone down that path of two playmakers in the midfield. Look at every great team in the world, they all play that way, and England must stick with that combination going forward.

Breakdown

I’m a huge advocate of Steffon Armitage and I find it utterly baffling the RFU won’t make an exception for such a world-class talent. England’s back-row balance is not right at the moment, with the excellent Robshaw much better suited to the blindside flank, and yet they have this world-class talent across the channel who is ready and willing to play.

Question marks over Farrell's fitness means England should pick Danny Cipriani

Go for broke: pick Cipriani

Danny Cipriani is such a talented fly-half who has produced consistent performances for Sale for more than a year now.

I’m a big fan of Farrell when he’s fit and firing while Ford has huge potential with his quick feet and good hands. But for me, Cipriani is a cut above any other fly-half in England and he now has experience to add to undoubted quality. Why won’t England pick him?

Pace at 13

If England are going to play Farrell at No 12, they simply must pick a flyer at 13. Barritt is not that man. When fit, Manu Tuilagi has all the credentials in terms of pace and size, but if he is not in the side, England need to discover a 13 with pace to burn.

Come in No 7

The openside spot still bothers me but that will be a constant dialogue until the World Cup. If Robshaw falls over on the eve of the tournament then Lancaster will have to throw in a rookie. Even New Zealand rotate Richie McCaw with Sam Cane and if he is unavailable, then they have a ready-made re-placement. Saturday's game against Samoa should have been an occasion for Lancaster to look at another option whether that be Fraser, Kvesic or... Armitage.

Find the extra edge

The difficulty at that level is to work out where you can find that extra couple of per cent from, either within yourself or the team. You are the best man in the country in your position, that is why you have been picked, but you have a duty to look at your game and mindset and work out where you can get those marginal gains from. Under Clive Woodward we had the constant message of trying to find those extra ‘one percenters’, the England players must adopt that mindset and find the belief.
