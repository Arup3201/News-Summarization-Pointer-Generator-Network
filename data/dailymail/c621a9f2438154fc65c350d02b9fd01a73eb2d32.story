Formula One star Lewis Hamilton has taken advantage of a rare weekend off to watch his beloved Arsenal host champions Manchester City at the Emirates.

The 29-year-old, who is a big fan of the north London side, was pictured on the side of the pitch before Saturday's lunchtime kick-off, which ended in a 2-2 draw.

Hamilton found time to chat with Gunners winger Theo Walcott, who is just a few weeks away from returning from a long-term knee injury.

The Mercedes driver is fresh from winning last weekend's Italian Grand Prix at Monza, a result which closed the gap on his rival Nico Rosberg at the top of the drivers' world championship. 

Hamilton would had hoped for a better performance than the reverse fixture last season, where the Gunners were thumped 6-3, and he got it after a hard-fought draw.  

Arsene Wenger's side are unbeaten in their four games so far, having beaten Crystal Palace and drawn with Everton and Leicester City.
