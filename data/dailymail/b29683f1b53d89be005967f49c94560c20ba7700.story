Model and businesswoman Miranda Kerr is kicking off 2015 as she means to go on: by building her brand even bigger.

The supermodel, who last year clocked in deals with Reebok, H&M and Swarovski, is already busy planning her latest range for Royal Albert, which will include silverware, glassware and gifts. 

FEMAIL caught up with the Australian star to discover the inspiration behind her range, how she balances her hectic work schedule and all of her beauty and wellbeing secrets.

Miranda Kerr has launched her debut tea collection for Royal Albert, and is busy planning her upcoming range of silverware, glassware and gifts

Sharing the inspiration behind her new range, which costs £25 for a cup and saucer, and £50 for a cake stand, the star said: 'I spent a lot of time with my grandma growing up and she had a Royal Albert tea collection that I was mesmerised by... it was really treasured by all our family.

'So, when Royal Albert approached me to design a collection I thought it was a wonderful opportunity.'

Miranda, who has penned two 'positive thinking' books, explains that she wanted to create a timeless collection that was inspired by her 'love of peonies and the gracefulness of butterflies'. 

'Butterflies are very symbolic for me as they embody the changes that we all need to go through in life, and are also a symbol of faith and joy,' she said. 

'I like the fact the range is delicate and feminine, this is something I definitely wanted to capture across the range.'

Miranda follows a balanced diet, but treats herself to chia seed muffins when she wants to indulge and complements her diet with a serious fitness regime

The 31-year-old, who has a son, Flynn, with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, explains that tea is extremely important to her because it's her 'me time'.

'It’s an opportunity to take some time out, talk about how your day’s been, it’s time to regroup and re-energise. It’s a feel good time - that’s what I like,' she said.

Aside from tea, the virtuous star, who cites her New Year's resolution as 'continuing to work on balance in all areas of her life', has long promoted a healthy diet and superfoods.

Miranda, who is a walking advert for the healthy lifestyle she leads, shared one of her favourite healthy recipes. 

'I enjoy so many superfoods such as noni juice, which is one of the key ingredients in my skincare line Kora Organics,' she said.

'I also make my own superfood smoothie with maca powder, acai powder, spirulina, cacao powder, coconut oil and chia seeds, which is alkalizing and nutrient dense. 

'Avocado is also great for skin health and I probably have half an avocado a day.'

Despite following a healthy diet, the svelte star and former Victoria's Secret model admits that she allows herself to 'indulge' and 'doesn't deprive herself'.

'I live by the philosophy of 80/20…meaning I eat healthily 80 per cent of the time and indulge 20 per cent of the time. For an everyday treat, I cook gluten-free muffins with blueberries and chia seeds.'

She complements her balanced diet with a serious fitness regime, saying she likes to  keep active and do some form of exercise every day.

'It’s a combination of either yoga, pilates, resistance training or something with my son such as hiking or riding our bikes. I also like jumping on the little mini trampolines too; it’s a really good way to stimulate the lymphatic system and it lifts your mood,' she said.

When she isn't modelling, designing tea cups or spending time with her son, Miranda works on the project she's most passionate about: her organic skincare line.

The flawless star set up KORA Organics  after failing to find products that she wanted to use on her skin anywhere in the world.

The products, which use all organic ingredients, including superfoods, represent her healthy and balanced lifestyle, she said.

'We’re working on some new exciting products and also some formulation enhancements. I can tell you more in the coming months as soon as release dates are finalised,' she revealed.

Obviously, Miranda swears by her range and her cosmetics bag is packed with her own lip balm, hand cream and mist. Mascara, eyelash curlers, RMS concealer, RMS Lip2Cheek in red, tweezers, a nail file, and a little magnifying mirror also make up her beauty essentials.

'If I’m travelling I like to have my Kora Organics Luxurious Rosehip Oil packed too. I remove my make-up and apply the rosehip oil, it really revitalises, hydrates, brightens and protects the skin it because it’s packed with antioxidants,' she said of her must-have. 

Miranda, who covered the February issue of Harper's Bazaar, ensures she finds time to relax in between her hectic schedule and has previously explained that she books chunks of time off to unwind.

So how does the world's busiest woman relax? 'Having a laugh with friends and family is really important,' she said.

'Other simple things like reading a book to my son really help me relax. Or enjoying the sunset, being in nature, taking my shoes off and putting my feet in the grass, having a fresh bouquet of flowers, having a cup of tea, lighting a candle, having a bath, these things make me feel really happy.'
