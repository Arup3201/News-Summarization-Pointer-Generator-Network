A talented young footballer has been found dead on a Mississippi highway after two cars ran over him.

Troy Trojans footballer college Jadarius Garner, 20, was pronounced dead after he was found lying in the southbound lane on Highway 61 in Bolivar County at 2.27 a.m. on Thursday, according to Mississippi Highway Patrol spokesman Anthony Dunn.

The state highway patrol is currently investigating his death after they responded to what is believed to be a two car accident about three miles south of O’Reilly, Mississippi.

Troy University coach Larry Blakeney spoke of the tragic loss, describing the player as a talented, smart man.

‘This is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts and prayers go out to Jadarius' family in this time of grief,' he said.

‘There was so many positive things in front of him in life that we’d have liked to have seen him accomplish.

'Jadarius was a well-respected member of our football team and his loss will be felt by all of us.

‘Most of the time when we sit before you
 and talk to you or release news it’s about a win or a loss… normally 
upbeat but this is certainly different today.’
