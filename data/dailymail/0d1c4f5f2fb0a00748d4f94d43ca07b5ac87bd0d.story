Another former model has come out accusing beleaguered comedian Bill Cosby of plying her with alcohol and sexually assaulting her more than three decades ago.

Heidi Thomas, a 54-year-old music teacher from Colorado and a married mother of three daughters, this week added her voice to a chorus of allegations against the comic.

More than a dozen women have publicly accused Cosby, 77, of sexual misconduct in recent months, many of them claiming that America's beloved TV dad took advantage of them while they were intoxicated.

Cosby and his attorney have staunchly and repeatedly denied all the allegations.

One more accuser: Heidi Thomas (left), a married mother of three from Colorado, claims that Bill Cosby (right) sexually assaulted her in 1984 when she came out to Reno to get an acting lesson from him  

Lawyer Martin Singer said in a statement to CNN that it defies common sense that 'so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.'

In 1984, Heidi Thomas, nee Johnson, was a 24-year-old model from Denver, Colorado, who was dreaming of a career in acting.

Thomas was being represented  by the city's top modelling agency, JF Images, but by 1984 she was questioning whether or not she wanted to stay in the business.

Then one day in the spring of 1984, she got a call from an agent who told her that a famous entertainer was searching for young talent to mentor.

Thomas said that Annie Maloney, of JF Images, instructed her to travel to Reno, Nevada, where she was supposed to meet with Bill Cosby, who allegedly had expressed interest in becoming her acting coach.

Cosby was already a famous comedian by that time but not yet a household name, as the premiere of his trailblazing sitcom The Cosby Show was still five months away.

The stand-up comic was performing April 4, 1984, at Harrah's Hotel and Casino in Reno, and Thomas was told to meet him there for a coaching session.

When the tall, slender model arrived in Nevada, she was picked up from the airport in a limousine. But instead of taking her to Harrah's, the driver transported Thomas to a private home on the outskirts of town, telling her that a friend had lent Cosby the property so he wouldn't be assailed by paparazzi.

Bill Cosby greeted Thomas at the entrance and ushered her inside, according to the woman.

The aspiring actress began by performing a monologue for Cosby, who then asked her to do a cold read of a person who was intoxicated.

Thomas said Bill Cosby was not impressed because to his mind, she was not convincing as a drunk.

Change of heart: Mrs Thomas, seen here with her husband, decided to speak out about the 1984 incident after learning that her mother knew about it 

Heidi Thomas recalled that Cosby wanted her to relax, so he poured her a glass of Chablis.

The married music teacher said that her memory of the next several hours is very hazy, but when she woke up later that night, she found herself in bed next to a naked Bill Cosby who was 'forcing himself' in her mouth.

According to the woman, the married comedian then got on top of her and said to her: 'I'm your friend... your friend is gonna [ejaculate] again,' according to the 54-year-old mother of three.

Thomas said she was confused as to what happened and eventually stormed out of the room and slammed the door behind her, but she later apologized to Cosby for being rude.

Thomas' memory of the remainder of her four-day trip to Reno is foggy. She recalled riding with Cosby to Harrah’s and having a drink with him before the show, but not much else.

She could not even recall calling her mother from Reno to tell her that she had done something ‘wrong,’ or getting on a plane to go home.

Thomas also had no memory of being picked up by her parents at the airport in Denver.

Months later, Heidi Thomas attended Bill Cosby's show in St Louis and went backstage to meet him, but she never brought up their encounter in Reno.

The former model kept the incident a secret from everyone for three decades, believing that she was somehow to blame for what happened.

But Thomas said she had a change of heart a couple of weeks ago when her mother, Greta Lea Johnson, finally told her about the disturbing phone call from Reno 30 years ago.

Mrs Johnson said she kept mum about the conversation with her daughter all these years because she wanted things to go back to normal.

‘I finally find out that she knows, that dad knows, that they are supporting me if I want to go public...Then it became full steam ahead, I want to empower people,’ Heidi Thomas told CNN.
