Angela Callaghan invented six children to fraudulently claim almost £43,000 in state benefits

A single mother who invented six children in order to falsely claim £43,000 in benefits, then helped other women copy her scam, has been jailed for a ‘flagrant and brazen’ fraud.

Angela Callaghan, 42, cashed in on a loophole which means tax credits are paid out without claimants having to submit a child’s birth certificate.

Over three years the mother of two claimed for six fictitious children, including twins she said she was looking after for her sister and one on behalf of her teenage daughter.

Not content with that, jobless Callaghan – already a convicted benefits fraudster – began helping other Liverpool mothers to perpetrate the same fraud, receiving a cut of up to £700 from each.

It drew comparisons with the notorious White Dee from Channel 4’s controversial series Benefits Street – with the crucial difference that Deirdre Kelly argued she was helping neighbours make legitimate claims.

Callaghan’s scam cost taxpayers more than £55,000 in total until it was exposed.

Yesterday she was jailed for 12 months, despite her lawyer asking for leniency because she has a – genuine – four-year-old son.

Three other mothers who took part in the swindle, falsely claiming £4,151, £2,956 and £2,502, were given suspended sentences earlier this month.

Last night Tory MP Priti Patel said: ‘This is an appalling example of flagrant abuse of the benefits system. Hard-pressed taxpayers are sick and tired of hearing of such abuse and this case shows exactly why we need sanctions and tough sentences for individuals who break the system.’ 

Callaghan had been given a community sentence for a £9,000 benefits fraud in 2008, but the following year she invented a twin of her then 16-year-old daughter, Adele, and began claiming tax credits in her name.

Over a three-year period, she created fictitious children named Jordan, David, Lucy, Alex, Zach and Layla, Liverpool Crown Court was told.

They included twins she claimed to be looking after on behalf of her sister, and a baby she said was her daughter’s but who was in her care.

She made £42,925 between 2009 and 2012 and wrongly claimed a further £2,577 in child benefit payments for Adele by failing to declare that she had left full-time education.

Neighbours of her £110,000 semi on a quiet street near Aintree racecourse in Bootle, yesterday told how the property had been refurbished, apparently using the proceeds of the fraud, including a new patio and wrought-iron gates.

Liverpool Crown Court heard that Callaghan began abusing the benefit system in 2009 when she contacted the authorities to add additional children to her existing legitimate claim for tax credits for her daughter

In 2011 she began advising other mothers 
on how to follow suit, ‘claiming a kick-back from the proceeds 
wrongfully paid out as her reward’, said Kevin Slack, prosecuting.

Mothers
 already receiving tax credits would give her their passwords and bank 
details, and she would call the helpline pretending to be them and 
having recently given birth to twins, the court heard. This resulted in a
 back-dated lump sum being paid into the recipient’s account followed by
 further regular payments with no further proof required, said Mr Slack.

‘The
 process of reporting changes of circumstances is designed to be simple 
for the customer and the system relies very much on the honesty of the 
person notifying the change,’ he added. After Callaghan admitted five 
benefit offences, Sarah Phelan, defending, urged Judge David Aubrey, QC,
 not to send her to prison. But the judge jailed her and the court heard
 that Callaghan’s daughter, now 21, will care for her brother while she 
serves her 12-month sentence.

A spokesman for HMRC said: ‘We check 
all the information provided for a tax credits claim and constantly 
evolve these checks to ensure they remain effective. As this case shows,
 we do detect fraud and we do stop it.’

Last year HMRC admitted 
1.4million tax credit claims – or one in five – were being overpaid, 
with losses through fraud and error put at £850million a year.
