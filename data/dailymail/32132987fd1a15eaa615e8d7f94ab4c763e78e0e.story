Ann Curry was sporting a new look when she returned to live TV tonight for the first time since she was axed from the Today show.

With her hair cropped short and wearing a crisp white blazer, Curry looked happy to be back in the anchor chair as she hosted the NBC Nightly News, filling in for Brian Williams.

The beloved journalist tweeted a picture of herself preparing for the broadcast, which prompted a flood of praise from excitable Curry fans.

The 56-year-old has appeared on NBC a handful of times since her awkward departure from the network's flailing morning show last summer.

However, the appearances have mostly been pre-recorded segments for Williams' show Rock Center.

After tweeting 'From the set.. Getting ready to anchor @NBCNightlynews,' user chefbigham was quick to respond 'WooHoo!!!! You are the only reason to watch the news' while another fan, saseesandee wrote '@anncurry YeeHaw, so lovely to see u back!'

Curry's noticeably shorter hair reportedly got her in trouble with network executives, after she lopped it off without permission from NBC, in what was labelled an act of defiance.

Amidst criticism over the journalist's physical appearance by her former Today bosses, Curry 'just decided to cut it,' according to RadarOnline.com.

'Ann was always told by her bosses that 
her hair had to be long, and she just didn’t like to wear it at that 
length,' a source revealed.

'She is a no-fuss gal, and doesn't want to spend a ton of time 
styling her hair. (So) she just decided to 
cut it.'

They continued: 'It’s a much shorter style, and doesn’t take as long to do. Ann 
didn't tell her bosses she was going to do it beforehand.'

Like many other networks, any NBC on-air 
talent is required to notify management before changes are made to their physical appearance.

But Curry was often the victim of 
jokes at the hands of Today show executive 
producer Jim Bell, according to New York Times reporter Brian Selter's new book, Top Of The Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV.

defiance, Ann Curry debuted a new, shorter hairstyle on NBC News without informing the networks executives

Stelter reported that Bell was an instigator to 'a 
general meanness on set' toward the former Today co-host.

In the months leading up to her teary-eyed departure from the morning show last summer, Curry is said to have been 'tortured'.

In one instance, a yellow dress Curry wore on air was pictured next to Big Bird, and was captioned, 'Who Wore It Best?'
