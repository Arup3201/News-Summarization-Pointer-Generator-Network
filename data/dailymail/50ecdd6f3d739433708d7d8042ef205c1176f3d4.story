MPs are in line for an extra week off, adding to mounting evidence the Coalition is running out of things to do.

Government sources last night confirmed they are considering giving MPs an additional week’s holiday, fuelling criticism that with so few laws to debate, and more than a year to go before the next election, the Commons and Lords are turning into a ‘Zombie Parliament’ of part-time politicians.

It follows an announcement last week in the Lords, that peers are to get an extra five days off at Easter.

Last night Labour seized on the news as proof the Coalition is ‘becalmed’. It means MPs may get 24 weeks off this year.

The Mail on Sunday revealed in January that the Queen’s Speech is to be delayed from its planned date of May 7 because the Government is short of ‘exciting’ policies to put in the legislative programme. It will now take place on June 3.

There have also been repeated claims that with so little to occupy them, many MPs are going home after the weekly Prime Minister’s Questions.

One insider said: ‘Some MPs come down on Monday afternoon and leave by Wednesday afternoon.

‘Everyone keeps quiet about it because they know voters would be horrified.’

By the middle of last year, MPs and peers spent 284 hours debating government legislation. That compares with 389 hours at the same point during Tony Blair’s second term.

An extra week’s holiday would mean MPs
 are scheduled to sit in the Commons for a total of 140 working days in 
2014, equal to 28 weeks, or approximately seven months. It compares with
 an average 224 working days for most people, who get an average five 
weeks’ holidays.

With so little to do at work, peers have instead turned their 
minds to their stomachs by drafting in Anton Edelmann, Head Chef of the 
Savoy for 21 years, to spruce up menus at the House of Lords. 

Mr
 Edelmann, who now runs Anton’s restaurant in Hertfordshire – a mock 
Tudor mansion with a champagne bar – serves up dishes such as crab 
tortellini with cauliflower puree and quail salad with foie gras, king 
prawns and mango.

MPs have already been given an extra week off before the referendum on Scottish independence on September 18.

Last
 night, Westminster sources claimed the likeliest extra holidays would 
come before the planned Whitsun’ recess which starts on May 22.

Shadow Cabinet Office Minister Jonathan Ashworth said: ‘If you ever needed evidence that David Cameron’s government has run out of ideas, it is that the House of Commons may not sit for a week as planned because there is no legislation.’

But a Minister insisted: ‘It’s complete nonsense to say we are running out of steam. We have lots of ground-breaking ideas which will be outlined in the Queen’s Speech.’
