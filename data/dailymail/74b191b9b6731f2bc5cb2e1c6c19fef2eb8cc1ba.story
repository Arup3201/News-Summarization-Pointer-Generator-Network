An international human rights group has accused Israel of committing war crimes during the brutal 50-day war with Gaza which left more than 2,100 Palestinians dead.

Human Rights Watch has said it reached the conclusion after investigating three attacks on or near United Nations-run schools housing displaced Palestinians, in which at least 45 people were killed.

The New York-based group, which carried out field research and interviews with witnesses, said no military targets were apparent in the area of the schools and some of the attacks were indiscriminate.

Human Rights Watch said its inspection of the Beit Hanoun site and photographs of munitions remnants suggested Israel fired mortars at the school, killing 13 people 

'The Israeli military carried out attacks on or near three well-marked schools where it knew hundreds of people were taking shelter, killing and wounding scores of civilians,' Fred Abrahams, special adviser at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. 

'Israel has offered no convincing explanation for these attacks on schools where people had gone for protection and the resulting carnage.'

Israel says the heavy civilian death toll during the war was the fault of Islamic militant group Hamas, which it accused of launching rockets, and drawing retaliation, from school yards, residential areas and mosques.

The Israeli military yesterday announced it had launched its own probe into cases involving Palestinian civilian casualties during the war, including the shelling of a U.N school.

More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed during the war, the majority of them civilians, according to Palestinian and UN officials. Israel says the number of militants killed was much higher and accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields. On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed. 

About a quarter of a million Palestinians displaced by the violence were seeking shelter in UN-run schools.

Human Rights Watch said 45 people, including 17 children, were killed in or near the 'well-marked schools' in the strikes on July 24 in the northern Gaza town of Beit Hanoun, on July 30 in Jabalya refugee camp and on August 3 in Rafah, in the south of the enclave.  

In one instance, in the attack on a school in Beit Hanoun on July 24, Israel said it had fired mortars toward Hamas fighters operating near the school, in response to anti-tank fire directed at them.

The military said one mortar landed in the school courtyard, which according to video footage it released claiming to show the strike, was empty. 

Human Rights Watch said that seven Palestinian witnesses in the territory ruled by the Hamas militants disputed the claim.

On the strike on July 30, the military said it was again responding to Hamas fire from nearby. Human Rights Watch said Israel provided no evidence for the claim. 

'In any event, the use of high-explosive heavy-artillery shells so near a shelter filled with civilians constitutes an indiscriminate attack,' the group said.

It said the attack in Rafah, in the southern Gaza Strip, was 'unlawfully disproportionate.'

The attacks on the schools had elicited widespread condemnation, with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon calling one a 'moral outrage and a criminal act.' 

The UN, which has accused both Israel and Hamas militants of violating the rules of war, has appointed a commission of inquiry to look into the fighting.

Western-backed Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is threatening to seek membership in the International Criminal Court in order to press charges against Israel.

The Israeli military yesterday said it has opened criminal probes into two wartime cases, including the school attack in northern Gaza.

The military has beefed up its legal teams and gathered reams of evidence, including photos and video clips, meant to prove that Hamas used civilian areas for cover when firing rockets and to show that Israel showed restraint in its responses.

Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman, told the Associated Press that the military has confidence in a system that works.

'We are doing it so that we can improve and so that if people have carried out things not in line with rules and regulations that they will pay a personal price,' he said. 'Every decision our military advocate general makes is under scrutiny from the civilian establishment.'

Meanwhile, a new World Bank report today said that continued 'political instability resulting from conflict, military rule, violence, political division, and lack of free movement and access to resources and markets' is the main obstacle to economic growth in Palestinian territories.
