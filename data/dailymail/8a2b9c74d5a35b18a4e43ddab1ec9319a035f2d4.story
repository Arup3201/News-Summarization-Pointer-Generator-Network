A Lego enthusiast has spent one month building a fully functioning keyboard made entirely from the coloured bricks. 

Jason Allemann, 41, used more than 1,500 Lego pieces to create the keyboard which can be used on any computer. 

Lego has captured the imaginations of children and adults for generations resulting in millions of sets being manufactured each year.

Mr Alleman, from Ontario, in Canada, said: 'I had seen some other custom themed keyboards online, built using other materials, and I thought they were pretty cool. It sparked my interest in building one using Lego bricks.

'My love for Lego began as a child. I really enjoyed building and playing with the classic Lego space and early Technic sets. Since coming back into the hobby as an adult, I probably have somewhere around 500,000 Lego pieces in my collection.'

The keyboard is fully functional and capable of performing to the same level as a normal keyboard.

'It's pretty part intensive,' said Mr Allemann, a computer software developer who displays his Lego models under the name JK Brickwork.

'Most of the keys are built using nine pieces and there are over 100 keys. Add a few hundred pieces for the frame and I would guess there are around 1,200 pieces in it.'

Mr Alleman had to track down every single lettered tile to complete the keyboard, forcing him to get creative with a few symbols such as the colon, semi-colon and slashes. 

He said: 'I had most of the pieces already in my collection, so it didn't really cost me much to source the few extra parts I needed.

'Lego is pretty expensive though, and I'm sure sourcing all the parts from scratch would cost well over $100.'

One of the main issues Mr Alleman encountered while constructing the keyboard was aligning the keys over the membrane, which he accomplished by using a system of Lego Technic axles to precisely position the keys.

The second problem was even more difficult as a standard keyboard is screwed together in order to keep the interface, between the original circuit board and sensor membrane under pressure, causing Jason to use non-standard building techniques to replicate the same amount of pressure.

After putting the project to one side for a number of years, due to frustrations with the angle of the keyboard, Jason revived the project earlier this year to the delight of Lego fans across the world.

His YouTube video highlighting the project has already become a hit, having been viewed around 750,000 times.

However, to the dismay of many LEGO fans, Jason has no plans to create any more Lego keyboards and it will only be for his personal use.

'The feedback has been incredible. It seems a lot of people have really enjoyed seeing what is otherwise a pretty dull, everyday object rendered in more of a humorous and whimsical Lego form. I have had countless requests for instructions or to outright purchase it.

'My goal, as I was building, was to produce more of a unique artistic piece rather than a kit or item to be sold.

'What really drives me with this hobby is the problem solving aspect of building within the constraints of the Lego system.

'Now that the keyboard is complete I'm much more interested in moving on to other projects than building more of them.'
