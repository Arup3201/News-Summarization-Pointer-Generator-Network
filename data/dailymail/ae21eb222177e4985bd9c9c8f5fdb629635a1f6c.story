The couple whose proposal was photographed by a bystander in a St. Paul, Minnesota, park in a widely-shared Instagram photograph last week have come forward and revealed themselves.

Luke Peterson told MyFox9 that before he asked Stephanie Yarian to marry him in  Rice Park last Thursday, the pair went out for both dinner and dancing.

'My plan was to drive by there and then kind of have her be the one to think about like "Yeah, we should go check out those lights" and "Oh, sure we could do that,"' he told the television station.

Bystander Joy Son happened to be in Rice Park when Peterson's proposal took place.

Son told MyFox9 someone pointed out the proposal to her while she was photographing park adornments.

She told the television station 'I tried to zoom in to snap a picture but by then it was too late and I ended up taking a picture of them after they stood up.

'I was pretty bummed that I didn't get a picture of them and quickly got over it until I was scrolling through my camera roll at a restaurant we went to afterwards and found a picture of them!"

She wrote of the photograph on Instagram 'I was so busy trying to take a photo of the tree lights, I didn’t see that I actually captured a proposal! I’d love the chance to share this with the couple and would appreciate any help! This was at Rice Park in St. Paul on 12/18/14 around 10:00pm.'

As of this writing, the photo has been liked over 2,400 times on Son's profile and received 186 comments. 

Yarian revealed she was the woman in the picture in the Instagram photo's comments section after a pal mentioned a Star Tribune story about the picture, MyFox9 reported.

Countdown: Stephanie Yarian and her fiance Luke Peterson are planning nuptials for late June 

'It had our picture and it was like "Mystery couple" and I was like "Oh my gosh." I was like "Abby this is me!"' Yarian said in an interview with Fox31.

'It was really cool, I mean the picture is beautiful and I just think it captures everything in that moment and it's really fun to look back on it and see it,' she also said.

The couple crossed paths as University of Northwestern in St. Paul students, though Peterson has since graduated from Minnesota State University-Mankato, MyFox9 reported. Yarian is still at the University of Northwestern.

Peterson told MyFox9 'I was like "Well, if we just posted that on Facebook, probably wouldn't have had nearly as much interest in it, like - like it does now, but the anonymity of it, I think.'

The couple is planning nuptials for late June, according to Fox31.
