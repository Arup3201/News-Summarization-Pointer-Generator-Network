Sunderland have announced their latest summer signing - a partnership with American side D.C. United.

The agreement between Gus Poyet's side and the second-placed team in MLS' Eastern Conference will see the two clubs share coaching and business expertise, while also promoting one another in their respective markets in Europe and the United States. 

It comes after Tottenham and Toronto set up a commercial partnership following former England international Jermain Defoe's move between the clubs, and following Manchester City's investment with the New York Yankees into the new MLS franchise New York City FC.

D.C. United are one of the biggest successful clubs in Major League Soccer, having won 13 international and domestic titles since the clubs' inclusion into the league in 1996.  

Interest in the Premier League is at an all-time high in the United States, particularly after major broadcasting service NBC secured the rights to show each of the 380 top flight matches live during the 2014-15 season.

Sunderland and D.C. United already have one link between them, the identity of the Black Cats' USA international Jozy Altidore. Altidore was part of Jurgen Klinsmann's World Cup squad before injury ruled out his involvement in the tournament in Brazil. 

The two clubs will work together on joint initiatives in both the UK and the US, with the Black Cats supporting D.C. United as they look to maximise the use of their proposed new stadium.

Gary Hutchinson, commercial director at Sunderland, said: 'Interest in football is growing massively in the USA, and our partnership with D.C. United will provide both clubs with an excellent opportunity to grow and evolve in each other's market.

'This is a major step forward for Sunderland AFC and a really exciting development for us in the US marketplace. We are continually looking at new ways to develop our international profile and our partnership with D.C. United will help us to build closer links with this key territory.' 

Sunderland have also developed links in Asia and Africa, highlighted by principal sponsor Bidvest. This has included the building of an academy in Tanzania with American-based company Symbion Power, and setting up football partnerships with Ghanaian football club Asante Kotoko and South African team Bidvest Wits.
