A college freshman left in a month-long coma and permanently brain damaged after getting caught up in a fraternity party brawl has made a 'miracle' turnaround and returned home  for Thanksgiving.

Jackie Lithgow, 19, was attending the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania when he was assaulted by a student from a neighboring school almost nine months ago.

Since the near-fatal incident, the teenager has had at least six skull operations and gone through hours of rehabilitation with meningitis and MRSA hindering progress.

However, on Tuesday, the Boiling Springs native was discharged from the Magee Rehabilitation Hospital in Philadelphia with doctors giving him the all clear.

Although he has made a remarkable recovery, the teen remains wheelchair-bound and has limited speech.

Lithgow suffered a major head injury after an assault on February 23 at a fraternity brother’s off-campus house party.

He  attempted to break up a fight involving four Kutztown University football players in the early hours of the morning when one of the men struck him.

The punch resulted in Lithgow hitting his head on the curb of a pavement.

A police report states that he was 'bleeding excessively from the back of his head and did not regain consciousness.' 

Days after the incident Kutztown University football player Angel Cruz, 21, turned himself in.

He has been in custody since and faces jail time after pleading guilty to assault earlier this month.

A second defendant, Justin Wieder, 21, of Quakertown, is also awaiting trial on assault charges, although he was not the one to deal the  blow.

Commenting on the case, Columbia County district attorney Thomas Leipold told philly.com: 'Here's a young man (Lithgow) with a future full of promise, and was acting as a peacemaker, and he was struck with a single blow that has completely changed his life.

'And on the other side of the coin, for the defendant, he struck a single blow, and I'm certain did not foresee or anticipate how bad the result of that could be. 

'And unfortunately, that just goes to show what the intersection of alcohol and ego and attitude can do, it can just produce absolutely tragic results for everyone involved.'

Lithgow, who has no recollection of the chain of events, has spent the past nine months in hospital.

His mother and father, Lisa and Jim, have stayed by his side throughout. His sister, 25-year-old Lindsay, has also been making near-daily visits.

The family, who have no idea where they stand with medical bills, have been detailing Lithgow's progress via a blog, prayforjackie.com. 

They have also used the site as a sounding board for their emotions.

On October 24, near the eight-month anniversary of Lithgow's assault, they described it as a 'senseless act of violence.'

'It is unthinkable and devastating,' the family  posted.

They continued: 'If any of us would have been told that eight months later Jackie would still be in the hospital, we wouldn’t have believed them.

'What he has experienced is more than anyone should have to endure.'

The family also noted that Lithgow had been steadily improving but there was still a long journey ahead. 

'During the process, we realized how far Jackie has come,' the post read. 

'His body, so frail at times, made it through countless surgeries and infectious setbacks and had so many foreign tubes, drains and IVs we stopped counting.'

Therapists Paula Bonsall and Erin Trudell, who worked with Lithgow from the beginning, say his brain is young and they're hopeful he will be able to walk unassisted within the next five years.

Lithgow returned home on Tuesday and will be spending Thanksgiving at his grandparents' house in Hershey where he simply wants to 'pig out.'
