A British aid worker awarded the MBE for his work was kidnapped yesterday by at least four gunmen.

Pro-Taliban fighters are suspected of seizing Khalil Dale, 60, in Pakistan after surrounding his Land Cruiser despite its clear Red Cross markings.

Mr Dale was honoured for his courage in some of the world’s toughest disaster zones, having been robbed at gunpoint, strafed by machine-gun fire and threatened by a man wielding a Kalashnikov rifle.

The slightly-built bachelor, previously known as Ken and a former nurse in Dumfries, was driving through the centre of the strife-ridden city of Quetta.

Mr Dale has been based in the troubled region, where kidnapping and insurgency are rife, for 11 months running health projects.

A veteran of aid work in Iran – where he was put on house arrest during the revolution – Libya, Kenya, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan and Afghanistan, he had chosen not to have protection.

Mr Dale converted to Islam in 1985 and changed his name. His work earned him the MBE in 1994, which he received from Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace.

Mr Dale once declared that confronting danger did not worry him, saying: ‘I just get on with the job and I believe in destiny. But I’ll put it this way: I’ve made my will.’

Criminal gangs in the area have often targeted foreign aid workers in the hope of securing large  ransoms but, by late last night, there had been no demands from Mr Dale’s captors.

The Foreign Office said it was urgently investigating the incident and was in touch with his family, although it was not clear if they are also in Pakistan.

In a statement, the International Red Cross called for Mr Dale’s ‘rapid and unconditional release’ adding that it had ‘no indication as to the abductors’ identities or motives’.

The charity added that it will continue its humanitarian work in Pakistan despite the kidnapping.

A spokesman for the British Red Cross said they were working to find out what had happened to Mr Dale.

Quetta is the main town of Baluchistan province, which borders Iran and Afghanistan. This has raised fears that he could be taken out of Pakistan, making any potential rescue much more dangerous.

The city is also home to the Quetta Shura, the Taliban’s leadership council which is believed to direct much of its militant activity. Ahsan  Mahboob, a senior police officer, said the aid worker had been travelling with a Pakistani doctor and a driver who were not seized.

An official of a security agency claimed the Red Cross in the city had received threats recently from Baloch United Liberation Army.

In February 2009, this group seized senior UN official John Solensky and held the American for two months.

nThe Iraqi militia which kidnapped five Britons in 2007 has offered to hand over the body of the last missing man. It claimed Alan McMenemy, from Glasgow, died trying to escape.

The bodies of three others in the group have been returned to Britain while the fifth man, IT expert Peter Moore, was freed alive in 2009.
