Dinosaurs living around 100 million years ago may have experienced acid trips after eating grass infected by a fungus similar to the species used to create LSD.

Palaeobiologists have discovered the earliest specimen of grass ever found trapped inside a piece of amber dug from a mine in the mountains of northern Myanmar.

When they examined the grass, however, they found the tips were infected with a fungus that is thought to be similar to Ergot, a group of fungi that grow on rye and wheat.

The tip of this grass spiklet, encased in amber 100 million years ago, is covered by a fungus similar to ergot

Compounds produced by ergot fungi, or Claviceps, can be hallucinogenic and were used by scientists to synthesis the powerful drug LSD that became popular in the 1960s.

Researchers who identified the fungus say that giant herbivorous dinosaurs living at the time would probably have eaten large amounts of this fungus.

Opium, magic mushrooms and other psychoactive drugs have been used by humans for thousands of years.

An anthropologist has discovered that humans have been cultivating and using mood-altering substances since the Stone Age.

Professor Elisa Guerra-Doce has compiled evidence from around the world that Neolithic people were taking drugs derived from cacti in 8,600BC and that they were cultivating opium poppies by around 6000BC.

Researchers have also found reddish stains on 13,000 year old human teeth found in a burial pit in Duyong Cave on Palawan Island in the southern Philippines, which are thought to be caused by chewing the leaves of the betel plant. 

It is still chewed through out much of Asia as a mild stimulant.

Charred cannabis seeds have also been found in bowls that date from the Bronze age Pit-Grave culture that appeared in Romania around 2000BC. 

Dr George Poinar, palaeobiologist at Oregon State University who helped conduct the research, said: 'There's no doubt in my mind that it would have been eaten by sauropod dinosaurs, although we can't know what exact effect it had on them.

'There is a good possibility that some of the chemical compounds found in the fossil were hallucinogenic.

'It seems like ergot has been involved with animals and humans almost forever, and now we know that this fungus dates back to the earliest evolution of grasses.

'This is an important discovery that helps us understand the timeline of grass development, which now forms the basis of the human food supply in such crops as corn, rice or wheat.

'But it also shows that this parasitic fungus may have been around almost as long as the grasses themselves, as both a toxin and natural hallucinogen.'

According to the analysis, which is published in the journal Palaeodiversity, the fossilised grass grew between 97-110 million years ago.

At this time - the middle of the Cretaceous period - the land was dominated by large dinosaurs and conifers.

However, it is around this time that the earliest flowering plants, grasses and small mammals were beginning to evolve.

Trapped inside the amber - which is formed from fossilised tree resin - is the spikelet from the tip of one of these early grasses.

Ergot now infects crops like rye (seen on the left) but scientists found a similar fungus on the fossil of a grass that grew 100 million years ago (right), suggesting the hallucinogenic fungi evolved with the early grasses 

The ergot fungi Claviceps purpurea, pictured above, produces compounds that have been used to make a range of medicines but was also used by scientists to synthesis the powerful hallucinogenic drug LSD

Dr Poinar and his colleagues from the USDA Agricultural Research Service and Germany found growing on the spikelet was also a now extinct fungus.

Named Palaeoclaviceps parasiticus, it is similar tothe Claviceps fungus that infects grass crops like rye and wheat around the world.

Claviceps contain compounds called ergotamine, which can be converted into lysergic acid, which can be hallucinogenic. Some species of ergot also contain large amounts of lysergic acid itself.

Scientists used ergotamine and lysergic acid to synthesis lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD.

The researchers speculate that Palaeoclaviceps and its relation Calivceps may actually have been helpful to grasses by helping them to repel herbivores.

The fungus is extremely bitter and can cause delirium, convulsions and severe pain.

LSD, pictured as a powder above, is a powerful psychedelic drug that was first sythesised from lysergic acid obtained from the ergot fungus but the hallucinogen was declared illegal in the UK in 1966 and the US in 1971

In cattle is causes a disease called Paspalum staggers while in the middle ages it is known to have killed thousands of people who ate infected rye bread.

More than 1,000 compounds have been extracted or derived from the fungus, with many of them becoming valuable drugs.

Ergotamine, for example, is a vasodilator and has been used in the past to control bleeding after childbirth and induce abortions.

Writing in the journal the researchers said: 'Few fungi have had a greater historical impact on society than ergot.'

A flesh-eating plant that grew in Russia about 40 million years ago is thought to be one of the earliest examples of predatory plants to be found.

The fossil was discovered perfectly preserved in amber, showing its leaves that are strewn with multi-cellular stalked glands and single cell hairs.

The new species was dug out of a mine near Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and is believed to be related to the 'flypaper trap' plant Roridula, found in the southwestern Cape of South Africa.

Roridula catches small prey - largely insects - with its leaves that are covered in an extremely sticky glue produced by the glands or tentacles.

Like Roridula, the Russian plant's leaves show evidence of different sized tentacles with which it would have captured prey and smothered it in slime before releasing digestive enzymes.

The tentacles, as well as the glands on the leaf surface, absorb the nutrients from the prey.

However it is not known  if the dinosaurs would have suffered hallicinations
