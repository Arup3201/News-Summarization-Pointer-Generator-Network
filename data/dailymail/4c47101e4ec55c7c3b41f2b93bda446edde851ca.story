Two former News of the World executives have hit back at their 'disingenuous' former boss James Murdoch as a bitter war of words engulfs the media empire.

The paper's former editor Colin Myler and ex-legal manager Tom Crone claim that they made Mr Murdoch aware of widespread hacking within the organisation as long ago as 2008.

But Mr Murdoch told MPs yesterday he 'disputed vigorously' the claims from Mr Myler and Mr Crone that they revealed the significance of an email indicating the practice was widespread.

The meeting in June 2008 centres on the 'For Neville' email which contained transcripts of hacked messages from the mobile phone of Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association. This email was apparently intended for chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck.

Had Mr Murdoch been fully briefed about the contents of the message it would have been clear to him that hacking was not limited to the single 'rogue' reporter, Clive Goodman, who was jailed in 2007.

Mr Myler and Mr Crone say he knew about the contents of the email. Mr Murdoch says he did not.

After the meeting, a payment of  £425,000 was made to Mr Taylor in return for a confidentiality agreement that prevents him from discussing the matter.

It is not known how such a significant payment could have been made without the full reasons being known by those at the top of the organisations.

Parliament was later told in July 2009 that hacking was restricted to a single reporter.

Mr Murdoch has repeatedly insisted to MPs that he had no knowledge of hacking.

The bitter row erupted yesterday after Mr Murdoch's bruising second appearance before the House of Commons Culture Committee's inquiry into the scandal.

The 'For Neville' email and the payment to Gordon Taylor were two of the main lines of questioning that MPs used to interrogate Mr Murdoch.

Mr Murdoch insisted he had not learned until recently that the practice of illegally eavesdropping on private phone messages was widely used at the newspaper.

The evidence given to the committee by Mr Crone and Mr Myler in September was 'inconsistent and not right', he said, adding: 'I believe their testimony was misleading and I dispute it.'

Committee chairman John Whittingdale said it was clear that of the two accounts MPs had heard about the June 2008 meeting to discuss settling a legal claim brought by Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor 'one of them cannot be true'.

Mr Murdoch admitted that he was made aware by Mr Crone and Mr Myler at that meeting of the existence of the 'For Neville' email.

But he insisted he was not shown it or told its full contents or significance.

Mr Watson told the hearing that he had spoken to Mr Thurlbeck, who claimed he was told by Mr Crone that he had shown the email to Mr Murdoch.

Mr Crone and Mr Myler had told MPs the email was the sole reason for deciding to pay Mr Taylor an out of court payment of £425,000, because it fatally undermined the 'single rogue reporter' theory.

They say the News International boss was fully aware of this, suggesting his denials to MPs were misleading.

However, asked by Labour MP Tom Watson whether he had misled the committee in his previous evidence, Mr Murdoch said: 'No, I did not.'

Mr Murdoch admitted he was made aware of the existence of the 'for Neville' email but said he was not shown it, nor told of its full contents by Mr Crone or Mr Myler when they discussed settling Mr Taylor's case at the June 10 meeting.

It was a short meeting, said Mr Murdoch,
where he was given 'sufficient information to authorise the increase of
the settlement offer that had been made. But I was given no more than 
that.'

He said the email 'was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect of it being a transcript of a voicemail interception that came through, that proved it was on behalf of the News of the World'.

He added: 'It was not shown to me, nor was it discussed with me its other features – that it was 'For Neville,' and that it might indicate wider-spread knowledge or wider-spread activities of phone-hacking.'

The two former executives fought back against Mr Murdoch's suggestions that they had misled Parliament.

Mr Myler and Mr Crone both issued statements last night standing by their original evidence to Parliament that their media boss knew the practice went beyond a single 'rogue reporter'.

'For Neville': The controversial email was destined for the paper's former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck

In a statement later, Mr Crone said he 'can perfectly understand' why Mr Murdoch 'felt the need to discredit' the two men but found it 'regrettable'.

'The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,' he added.

'At best, his evidence on this matter was disingenuous.'

Mr Myler said he had 'every confidence' the police would establish the truth adding: 'My evidence to the Select Committee has been entirely accurate and consistent. I stand by my account of the meeting with James Murdoch on 10 June 2008.'

The now-defunct newspaper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck said he had compiled his own secret dossier - partly held by the police - that he believed would be 'good news' for the beleaguered Mr Murdoch.

But Mr Thurlbeck said last night his dossier would be 'good news' because it would back up Mr Murdoch's claim that he has been 'seriously misled by senior executives on the News of the World'.

'But it will be bad news in the sense it will prove my case for unfair dismissal and will certainly cost News International the redundancy money which they owe me,' he added.

Labour MP Chris Bryant said Mr Murdoch’s credibility as chairman of parent company News International had been shattered by his claim that he was kept in the dark and failed to establish what happened.

Mr Bryant said Mr Murdoch, the son of News Corporation chief Rupert, should stand down. He said: 'I don’t think anyone really thinks he was telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. His defence was that he is incompetent — because he never bothered to ask the questions that a 12-year-old would have asked.

'If I was a shareholder in BSkyB or News Corporation, I would say, ‘you have allowed your company to corrupt the Metropolitan Police, to lie to Parliament, and to hack the best part of 6,000 people: It’s time you went’.'

The Labour MP and shadow justice minister said a director of a construction company would be held personally liable for any injuries and that being ignorant was no excuse.

The Times newspaper, part of the Murdoch group, today used a leading article to admit that the company mishandled the crisis by putting private investigators onto its critics.

It said: 'This was disgraceful. Instead of listening and responding to those asking legitimate questions, the company instead pursued its critics as enemies.'
