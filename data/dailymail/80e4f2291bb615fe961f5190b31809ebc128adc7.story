These dramatic images show the moment a man with 'cop-killer' tattooed across his knuckles, wanted for shooting four officers, was killed after a 16-mile police chase.

Christopher Chase, was found dead, slumped over the wheel of a stolen police car after being shot eight times - three times in the neck, once in the back of his head, scalp and upper back, twice in his left arm.

Police were embroiled in a 16-mile chase through Albuquerque after Christopher Chase opened fire at officers, injuring four, before stealing a police car and trying to escape

Dressed in body armour and camouflage and carrying an assault rifle described by an officer as being an AK47, Live Leak reported, the 35-year-old told witnesses to call police, and let them know he was waiting for them.

The video was shot from cameras mounted on the lapels of the officers involved.

It begins with Bernalilo County Sheriff's deputy Robin Hopkins telling her colleagues she is being shot at.

A male officer is seen being treated for a leg wound, by a colleague, his police car having been stolen by Chase.

Deputy Hopkins is then found slumped,
 injured in her car as colleagues are heard shouting 'She's been shot, 
she's been shot', in the background.

As the 16-mile pursuit progresses, an officer is heard to say, 'If someone has a clear shot to take the vehicle out'.

The
 next shot shows an officers apparently firing through the windscreen of
 his car with one hand, while steering with the other.Â

Officers are then embroiled in a gun battle at a petrol station, with several police cars on the forecourt, officers shielding behind the open doors.

After crashing the police car into a petrol pump, Chase was found slumped over the wheel of the stolen police car, blood splattered across the windscreen and inside of the vehicle.

He was wanted for shooting four officers, on October 26.

Three received minor injuries, while the fourth suffered a shattered thigh bone.

Documents released by the Office of the Medical Investigator show Chase was shot eight times in total.

The
 report showed he had three gunshot wounds on his neck near his sternum 
and another from a bullet that entered near the back of his head.

Another officer is seen on the floor having suffered an injury during the shoot out. Four officers in total were shot - three suffered minor injuries, while the fourth suffered a shattered thigh bone

At one point officers are heard shouting: 'She's been shot, she's been shot'

Officers followed Chase through the streets of the New Mexico city. Several police cars eventually surrounded the 35-year-old at a petrol station

An autopsy report revealed Chase suffered eight gunshot wounds to the neck, head and back. He was found slumped over the wheel of the blood-stained police car

Chase also had a gunshot wound on his scalp, a 'gaping' laceration that measured six inches by four inches at its widest point.

The 27-page autopsy report said Chase's brain was 'extensively lacerated' from at least two of the shots, adding it was impossible to track the trajectories of the bullets.

He was found to have suffered blunt injuries to his head and upper left arm as well.

APD spokeswoman Tasia Martinez said the shooting is still under investigation, and the department is waiting on the results of ballistics tests to determine how many officers fired and who they were.

'We do not know how many officers fired their weapons yet,' Martinez said.

She said six officers were placed on leave after the shooting, which is standard practise for officers involved in shootings.
