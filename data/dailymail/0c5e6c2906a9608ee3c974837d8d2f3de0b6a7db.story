This panda didn't want to go back into its enclosure at all.

As its trainer tried to leave the panda pen at the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding, this animal decided it still wanted some human company.

Latching on to the trainer's leg, the panda can be seen giving the man a hug hug and refusing to let down. 

The 41 second video filmed in China's southwestern city of Chengdu has gone viral as animal lovers around the world enjoy watching the adorable scene.

The research base was established in 1987 and it carries out a range of research and conservation work to protect the endangered species.

During the video the first panda grabs the right leg of the keeper just below the knee and the animal holds onto it for about 25 seconds while a second giant panda watches on.

The man finally manages to extricate himself and leaves the enclosure shutting the gate behind him.

But the pandas appear somewhat distressed as they clamber up the bars of the cage and watch the handler leave. 

Grip: The panda has a tight grip of the keeper's right leg during the initial stages of the video

Struggle: The research base employee manages to loosen the grip of the panda slightly

Gate: Finally the man gets his leg free, however, the panda is still making it difficult for him to close the gate

Almost there: The pandas appear very agitated as they watch the keeper lock the gate

Escape: The keeper manages to lock the pandas in the enclosure after his unexpected struggle
