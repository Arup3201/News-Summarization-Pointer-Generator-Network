Wrapping up warm can be a little difficult when you’ve lost your coat. Luckily, Lily the Shar Pei has a carer who doesn’t mind improvising.

So when she goes out walkies Lily always wears a onesie.

The snuggly all-in-one suit is the 
best way to keep the dog warm after an infection and a bout of mange 
left her bald and with skin so painful she could hardly bear to be 
touched.

Earning her stripes: Lily, a three-year-old Shar Pei rescue dog needs to wear a onesie to stay warm after losing her fur

Anne Rees, the RSPCA foster carer who is looking after 
three-year-old Lily, said the small adult-sized onesie, complete with 
tiger stripes, was the perfect solution.

‘Lily’s condition means she can get a 
bit cold, but she still needs plenty of exercise, which can be tricky in
cold weather,’ she said.

‘The onesie is a really good fit for her, and 
it keeps her warm when we’re outside. She loves wearing it and all the fuss she gets.

‘It does confuse people and other 
dogs. We were out walking last week and a little spaniel looked at her 
but obviously thought: “I better not take a tiger on.” ’

Snug and warm: Lily the hairless Shar Pei in her tiger onesie with her 'foster mum' Ann Rees

Lily was taken 
to the RSPCA in Worcester two weeks ago after her owner abandoned her 
because of the expense of treating her condition.

The poor dog suffers from mange and a bacterial skin infection, which is being treated, but she will take time to recover from.

But that doesn’t stop hairless Lily - who loves her new outfit costing £12 from Primark - from enjoying long walks and days out around Worcester town centre.

Lily was cared for at RSPCA Worcestershire & Mid-Worcestershire branch after she was abandoned there by an owner who couldn’t afford to treat her condition.

The Shar Pei is now in the care of Anne, who fosters dogs, and has been looking after her.

Wrapped up and ready for walkies: Lily in her Primark tiger onesie that gives other dogs plenty to think about

Anne, 50, who works from home as a typist, said: ''She has been suffering with mange and a
bacterial skin infection which, together, have left her almost totally 
bald, with skin that smelled really bad and was so sore and burning hot 
that she couldn’t bear to be touched.

'But she has special baths and treatment to help that infection - and she’s now well on the way to recovery.

'Wherever we go she creates interest. Not many people know her breed,especially when she’s dressed up as a tiger.

'When
she doesn’t have the onesie on, her bald skin makes her look a bit like
a pig, so I think she’d probably rather be mistaken for a tiger.

'Every
time we go for a walk, people stop us asking what breed she is or what 
the problem is with her or just to give her a stroke as they think she’s
so lovely.

'She’s gorgeous and has stolen my heart, as well as those who’ve met her.”

A spokesperson for RSPCA Worcester said: 'Lily came into our care two weeks ago, totally bald and with very sore pink skin, from an infection, which has been left untreated for a long time.

'Poor Lily is only three years old and has already had four litters of puppies. She will need a lot of love and care.

'We are seeking public donations to help fund Lily’s ongoing veterinary treatment. She is a lovely affectionate dog, with a sweet nature.'

The Worcester & Mid-Worcestershire Branch of the RSPCA need to raise £1 million to build a local branch rescue and re-homing centre, to provide 20 kennels, 20 cat pens and 20 rabbit pods.
