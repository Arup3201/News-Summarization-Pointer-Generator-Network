Three people have been killed and five seriously injured after their minibus was hit by a train at a level crossing in Switzerland - less than three weeks after a separate accident at the same site.

The minibus, which had been carrying four men and four women from Israel, is understood to have been travelling alongside the train when it took a right turn at a rail crossing.

The crash occurred near the town of Wolfenschiessen, about 30 miles south of Zurich, Nidwalden cantonal (state) police said in a statement. Nobody in the train was hurt.

Swiss public broadcaster SRF has reported the rail crossing had a warning light but no barrier.

The five injured in the accident were taken by helicopter and ambulance to hospital, The Local has reported. 

Swiss transportation workers union SEV said the crash could have been prevented, noting that there had been a similar accident at the crossing just two weeks earlier.

Swiss rail company SBB, a majority stakeholder in the company that operates trains on the picturesque Alpine route, said the crossing was scheduled to be upgraded by the end of 2015.
