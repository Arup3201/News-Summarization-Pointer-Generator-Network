Morten Storm made headlines around the world after going public with his jihadist-turned-double agent life story, and now the Danish national claims that Australian jihadists should be prevented from returning to the country, labelling videos released by ISIS 'pornography'.

Storm, 38, converted to Islam after spending time in prison and  falling in with controversial hate preachers such as Sheik Omar Bahri Muhammad in London and Luton, developing extreme jihadist views.

'I didn't have anything that I felt I belonged to because as a very young - in a very young age, I felt neglected by my parents,' he told ABC's 7.30.

'I didn't have anything that I felt I belonged to because as a very young - in a very young age, I felt neglected by my parents,' said Storm

'Islam was some kind of a structure, some - like a model way of life for me to follow, which I needed so badly. And I can tell you the first - when I just embraced Islam, I was a very, very happy person.'   

Storm then moved to Yemen in 2001 and grew close to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula leader Anwar al-Awlaki.

As he became trusted by fundamentalists, he met shoe bomber Richard Reid and, at one point, was offered the chance to meet Osama Bin Laden. 

'This ginger-haired, white-skinned Westerner — a one-time juvenile delinquent, biker gang member and jailbird, now a convert to Islam — was a signed-up member of Al Qaeda, dedicated to the destruction of kuffars [infidels], particularly in the U.S. and Britain,' Storm said in his memoir.

'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world,' said Storm

Morten Storm helped intelligence agencies after a 'crisis of faith' led him to turn his back on radical Islamists and become an intelligence agent informing on jihadists within Britain. 

In an interview with BBC's Newsnight he said: 'Once I had researched the contradictions, I finally realised how misguided I was and what a danger my associates were for the free world.' 

'I contributed to have some of the biggest terrorists removed from the face of Earth and many, many people have been imprisoned, evil people have been imprisoned because of my work,' Storm told 7 30.

Storm has previously said that he was instrumental in helping track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, but that US authorities had denied the part he played, and refused to give him the $US5 million they had promised him, something Storm has been vocal about. 

After making headlines around the world with his story, Storm is now wary of being targeted by ISIS, who released a video declaring him a traitor. 

'They will not give up. I mean, they will continue trying to get us. But they will fail, hopefully,' he told 7.30. 

Storm said that propaganda videos released by ISIS have a strong emotional impact on young Australian Muslims and that the Federal government should think about censorship.

'They are a extremely important propaganda tool and I hope that our governments will consider to ban them,' he said.

These people get emotionally involved and emotionally motivated, and then once they see the victory and see how easily that ISIS is taking over villages and slaughtering their enemies, then they say, "Well, that's - I want to be a part of that," and they feel that it's a religious duty to do that,' Storm said.

'They will not give up. I mean, they will continue trying to get us. But they will fail, hopefully,' he told 7.30

Storm said that the videos could be seen as a form of pornography for the gravity of impact they have on their intended audience in the Western world, as well as those already fighting.

His words come on the heels of another verified video of the beheading of American aid worker Peter Kassig by ISIS.

Storm said that the young men who have flown the country to fight with ISIS should be prevented from returning to the country. 

'This is a war. These people have declared war against us. We are in a war… I think we should not allow them to come back,' Morten Storm told 7.30. 

Storm's life is rumoured to be brought to the big screen by Paul Greengrass, director of the Bourne Identity spy-trilogy, The Guardian reports.

Sony Pictures are said to have bought the rights to turn the book into a film after Greengrass took it to American producer Scott Rudin, who worked with him on the Oscar-nominated Captain Phillips.
