The billionaire lover of writer Alexandra Tolstoy has had his assets frozen by the High Court.

Russian oligarch Sergei Pugachev, a former ally of President Vladimir Putin, faced legal action by the liquidator of his failed bank.

Now the High Court has placed a world-wide order freezing more than £1billion of his assets.

Lovers: Alexandra Tolstoy, right, has three children with Sergei Pugachev, left

Broadcaster and writer Miss Tolstoy, a distant relative of War And Peace author Leo Tolstoy, has three children with Mr Pugachev and they share homes in London and the South of France.

She has claimed he is the victim of a high-level conspiracy in Russia to take over his empire.

Mr Pugachev, who was once known as the ‘Kremlin’s banker’,  was taken to court by the liquidator of his bank Mezhprombank, which went bust in the global financial crisis, owing hundreds of millions of pounds.

Liquidator, the Deposit Insurance Agency, was granted an injunction this week freezing £1.17billion of his assets across the globe, including two London homes and a villa in Nice.

The freeze prevents him from selling the properties or doing anything to diminish their value.

He is also banned from spending cash in bank accounts.

Mr Pugachev, 51, is still allowed to spend up to £10,000 a week on living expenses plus legal bills.

Miss Tolstoy, whose relatives moved to Britain in the 1920s, said that one of the properties affected by the action is a £12million house in Battersea. Recently, she claimed that she owed nearly all her wealth to Mr Pugachev.

The Deposit Insurance Agency, represented by City law firm Hogan Lovells, alleges Mr Pugachev transferred hundreds of millions of dollars from his company to an account at a private bank in Switzerland.

It also claims he is ‘vicariously liable’ for the bank’s collapse.

The injunction declares: ‘If you, Sergei Viktorovich Pugachev, disobey this order you may be held to be in contempt of court and may be imprisoned, fined or have your assets seized.’

The same potential punishment applies to anybody who assists in breaching the order.

Miss Tolstoy was educated at Downe House, the same Berkshire boarding school that the Duchess of Cambridge briefly attended, and went on to study at Edinburgh University.

In 2009 she made the BBC documentary series, Horse People with Alexandra Tolstoy, in which she explored remote communities around the world where horses are central to the culture.

While spending a decade travelling around China, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan she met her first husband, a Cossack horseman.

During that marriage she lived in Moscow, where she gave English lessons to Mr Pugachev.

There was a minor scandal when she became pregnant by him while still married to the horseman.

When they split there was a legal row over the £250,000 Moscow apartment they shared.

She says this property and a cottage in Oxfordshire are the only assets she independently owns.

The deeply religious Mr Pugachev was the man who ignited Putin’s career by introducing him to the daughter of former Russian president Boris Yeltsin.

Despite once looking after the money of Putin’s inner circle, he fell out of favour in 2010 and was eventually forced to flee the country.

Having quit as a senator, Mr Pugachev lost immunity against prosecution in Putin’s courts.
