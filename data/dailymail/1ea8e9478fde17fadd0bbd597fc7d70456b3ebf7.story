An 87-year-old Winchester pensioner is taking the internet by storm thanks to his sense of rhythm.

Dancing to a rendition of the Frank Sinatra classic Come Fly With Me on his local High Street, Ronald Burgess can’t contain his smile.

Even the buskers aren’t annoyed that he’s stealing their spotlight.

He’s taken his moves to the streets since 1998 when his dancing partner, wife Dorothy, passed away.

‘I just love doing it,’ he said.

‘We all love dancing - dancing keeps you fit.’
