A woman who stayed with a 10-month-old girl after she was abandoned on a Manhattan subway platform has spoken out about locking eyes with the child's mother before her train pulled off.

In her first interview, Catherine Goodman insisted that anybody would do what she did when she saw baby Mylanea Love Edmonds alone on the platform at Columbus Circle on Monday morning.

On Tuesday, the child's mother, 20-year-old Frankea Dabbs, was arrested and revealed to police she had abandoned her because she was struggling to cope after the murder of the baby's father.

Speaking on HLN, Goodman recounted holding the door open for the mother and child as they boarded the 1 train on Monday.

Speaking out: Catherine Goodman recounted finding the baby girl who had been abandoned by her mother on a subway platform on Monday morning and how they waited for the woman to return

'I held the door for them to get on the subway car as I always do when I see a stroller,' she said.

She then moved to a different door on the train and a few stops later, she got off. As she walked towards the subway station exit, she saw the stroller left alone, she said.

'It was very funny - I saw the stroller and I looked up, and I saw the mom in the subway door just looking at us,' she said. 'The train pulled off and I was completely flummoxed.'

She said she notified an MTA officer about the baby, who was wearing bright pink socks on her hands to stop her from scratching her face. Goodman said the girl appeared to be in good health.

She waited with the MTA officer on a platform that would serve the downtown train - hoping that the incident was an accident and the mother would switch trains and return.

Safe: Baby Mylanea appeared to be in good health when she was found, Goodman said

'We were hoping she would just come back,' Goodman said. 'We waited a while for her to come back.'

When no one came to claim the child, the baby was taken to Transit District 1 Police Station.

She was then taken to St Luke’s Roosevelt hospital for evaluation before she was handed over to the NYC Administration for Children's Services.

Her mother was arrested shortly after midnight when a passerby recognized her from surveillance footage police had released and notified a nearby officer.

She allegedly admitted to the officer that she was the mother of the baby girl and was able to provide her name, age and medical history.

Relatives said that Dabbs, who was homeless after arriving in New York from North Carolina on July 2, had been plagued with troubles, including possible mental health issues and witnessing the killing of her baby's father during a home invasion just months ago.

Online records and mug shots also show she has previously been arrested for possession of marijuana, assaulting an officer, breaking and entering and solicitation for prostitution.

Charged: Dabbs (heading to her arraignment on Tuesday) said she felt overwhelmed caring for the child

NYPD 
spokesman Stephen Davis said: 'She felt she couldn’t take care of the 
baby and thought she was leaving her in a safe public space.'

At
 Manhattan Criminal Court for her arraignment on Tuesday, she turned to a
 television camera and verbally attacked rapper Jay-Z, real name Shawn 
Corey Carter, the New York Post reported.

She said: 'Is that rolling? Tell Shawn Corey Carter I said f*** him. Piece of s***.'

Dabbs was charged with felony abandonment and acting in a manner injurious to a child under the age of 17, a misdemeanor.
