Randy, who has only been taking wildlife pictures for ten years, said: 'I'm not sure an animal has the capacity to laugh but my dog smiles at me so maybe he was.

'He is one of three brothers who lived there with his mother and father and he was yawning.

'I seem to have some unusual luck when I go to zoos. If you're willing to stand there long enough then eventually everything will make a funny face.

Verdict: The photographer Randy revealed the fearsome cub, was probably yawning when he took the picture

'I stood there for an hour, kept the lens right on the cubs and just watched through it until he smiled.

'You can't get this kind of a facial expression unless you're really lucky and you've got to have a lot of patience.

'If you wait they will do something funny, like this one did.'
