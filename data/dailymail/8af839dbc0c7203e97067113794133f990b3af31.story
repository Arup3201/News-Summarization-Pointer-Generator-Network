Arrested: Gina Louise Causey has been arrested for a false rape claim against a fictitious police officer

A Louisiana woman has been arrested after falsely claiming she was raped to hide from her husband the fact she had fallen pregnant through an extramarital affair say police.

Gina Louise Causey, 40, was charged with criminal mischief after she arrived at Mandeville Police station with her husband on Tuesday crying rape.

Causey spun an outlandish tale, claiming she was sexually assaulted by a police officer.

She said he had raped several other women and he had caused her to become pregnant.

According to Mandeville Police Cpl. Kevin Covert, her story was 'like something straight out of Hollywood'.

She told police she was abducted at gunpoint in broad daylight while eating lunch at Mandeville lakefront.

Her attacker then made her lie on the floor of his car and drove for 'only a minute or so' to a nearby house where he took her inside and raped her.

Causey then said the fictitious rapist demanded she hand over her driver's license and he took a picture.

He then put it into a box 'wtih several other women's driver's licenses' and told her if she went to the police he would know according to NOLA.com

Tall story: Casey said she was raped at the Mandeville lakefront on Tuesday by a police officer

The story was apparently too much for officers who doubted it from the start.

They found inconsistencies with her time line and where she claimed to have been raped.

When confronted Causey folded and admitted she made the whole thing up to hide an extramarital affair from her husband and that she had become pregnant.

She has been booked on a misdemeanor charge and is unlikely to face jail time.
