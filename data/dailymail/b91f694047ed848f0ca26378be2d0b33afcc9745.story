George Efrem became the first-ever player to score a hat-trick for Cyprus as they romped to a 5-0 win in their Euro 2016 qualifier against Andorra in Nicosia.

The Apoel winger's first-half brace following Giorgos Merkis' opener, put the hosts in full control at the break, before he ensured the match ball would be his after slotting home his third of the night on the hour mark.

Dimitris Christofi added a late fifth from the penalty spot as the hosts recorded a second qualifying win in Group B, bouncing back from two successive defeats in the process.

Czech Republic defender Pavel Kaderabek celebrates his goal to make it 1-1 against Iceland

Elsewhere, the Czech Republic continued their 100 per cent record in Group A as they came from behind against Iceland to secure a 2-1 win. Goals from Pavel Kaderabek and Jon Dadi Bodvarsson cancelled out an early goal from Swansea's Gylfi Sigurdsson for the visitors.

Turkey climbed off the bottom of the same group as they recorded a 3-1 win over Kazakhstan. Two quick-fire first-half goals from Burak Yilmaz set the hosts on their way, with Serdar Aziz adding a third late on.

Samat Smakov's penalty proved to be a mere consolation for the visitors.
