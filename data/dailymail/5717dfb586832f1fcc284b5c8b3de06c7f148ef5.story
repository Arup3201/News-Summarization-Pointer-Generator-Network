The hacker also allegedly told Louch he was 'notorious' for hacking into celebrity accounts and distributing their nude photos.  

The hacker gave Louch specific instructions to drop off the money at a planter in Hollywood and she called the police who set up a sting operation to catch the swindler. 

HOT 97 reports that, at the time of the drop off, a woman -- Jamie Munoz -- showed up to collect the cash and was met by a swarm of police. 

Munoz admitted to agreeing to pick up the cash for the hacker but denied being apart of the plot.

Authorities say the woman gave the name of the hacker Nicholas Douglas from Vancouver, but officials have been unable to find him or prove he even exists. 

Munoz reportedly pleaded guilty to extortion and received no jail time but three years of probation and community service. 

Louch is not the first celebrity target of these infamous nude photo hackers.  

For the past two months, hackers have been causing strife in the celebrity world by hacking into Apple's iCloud -- an online backup service -- and distributing nude photos of celebrities like Rihanna, Jennifer Lawrence, and Kate Upton.

CNN reports that the hacking scandal began when hackers took advantage of a flaw in Apple's iCloud.

Since then, about 100 women and one man have reportedly fallen victim to these photo hackers.
