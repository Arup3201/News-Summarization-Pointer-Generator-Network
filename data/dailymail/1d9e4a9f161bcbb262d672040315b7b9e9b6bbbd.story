Picture the scene. A beautiful spring Monday morning. The Humber Bridge glistened in the sunlight. Birdsong filled the air, blossom falling from trees and a feeling of hope among all those lucky enough to be outdoors on that glorious day.

Around a hundred members of the local Women’s Institute were enjoying the day as they’d planned a march across the bridge. As they strolled along, they took in those beautiful sights and sounds.

The sun’s rays bouncing off the river. The larks whistling to one another. And myself and Nick Barmby rolling around on the grass, yelling and throwing punches at each other.

That was probably the most ridiculous situation I’ve ever been in as a footballer, and I say that having had my head shut in a door by Paul Jewell.

If you’re ever going to have a fight with someone, I would highly recommend not doing it in front of a hundred pensioners.

Dave Whelan was brilliant at bringing us all together at Wigan and was never shy with his generosity.

After one season, we were sitting in the dressing room, and he walked in with a huge leather sports bag.

‘Right, boys, listen up,’ he said. ‘You’ve achieved what we wanted to achieve so share this between you.’ And as he ended his sentence, he slid the bag across the floor and walked out.

We all looked at each other, thinking the same thing - there must be cash in the bag.

Our skipper Arjan de Zeeuw opened up the hold-all, peeped inside it, then looked up with a smile on his face.

‘It’s cash, boys!’ There must have been about £250,000 in there, which we all received a cut of in our next pay packet.

I was absolutely furious with Nick, and the scrap just happened to take place in the car park by the Humber Bridge because the gaffer had decided that’s where we were going to have our warm-down that morning.

It was the day after we’d been hammered by Everton live on telly in my first game back after my third knee injury. Not the ideal return, especially when you consider I had also had a stand-up row with Nick in the dressing room at half-time. And, as is always the case with these football flashpoints, it had started over something so stupid.

We went a goal down after Mikel Arteta had run unchallenged on to a deep, back-post cross. Nick was supposed to have picked him up, but was yards behind when Arteta volleyed in.

Nick was normally a fantastic presence at the back post, very good in the air and always covered danger thanks to his good positional sense. But, for whatever reason, he’d gone AWOL. Not a  disaster as there were only 17  minutes gone.

During a break in play, I ran past Barmby and said: ‘I thought you were comfortable at the back post there, Nick?’

‘F***ing comfortable!’ came his angry reply. ‘You f***ing cheeky b******!’

Whoah! I really hadn’t meant that much by the comment, other than expressing my disappointment because he was usually so good. He obviously felt like I was digging him out, but that’s football and these things happen.

I attempted to defuse the  situation: ‘Hang on a minute, all I said was that I thought you were comfortable on the back stick. We’re still in the game, it doesn’t matter.’ But he was still muttering away at me, and clearly not in a complimentary way. We came in at half-time 2-1 down, still in the game, but Nick wasn’t interested in that.

Joker: Bullard leading Hull's famous celebration after scoring against Manchester City

TJ Moncur was a young player at Fulham.

One morning he came in for training in a new Peugeot 206 convertible.

Once he’d cleared off, I grabbed a huge wheelie bin, filled it with water and poured it into his car. Which was quite funny, but not as funny as two wheelie bins full of water in it.

Alas, there was CCTV. After training, TJ and the boys gathered round a screen in the club office to see footage of me pouring water into his car.

‘Was that you in the car park, Jim?’ someone asked. ‘Errrr, no.’ Luckily, the warm weather dried the car out.

He was waiting for me and, in front of the whole team and management, he lost the plot and crossed a line. Instead of sticking to what happened on the pitch, he brought money — specifically my Hull contract — into it.

‘This club paid £5million for you and pays you £45,000 a week,’ he was ranting, as if to say I needed to be doing more to justify my wages.

I was incensed. How on earth had he gone from being p****d off about me having a go at him on the pitch to talking about my contract?

I was more aware than anyone of how much I owed the club, seeing as I was playing only my seventh game for Hull in more than a year, because of two serious knee injuries. But I certainly didn’t need him discussing my personal business in the middle of the dressing room at half-time.

I was raging inside and I could see some of the other boys were  shaking their heads implying that Nick was out of order but what I didn’t get, and still don’t to this day, is why (manager) Phil Brown or any of the management team never got involved.

‘Don’t worry,’ I said, fuming. ‘You’ve obviously got a bee in your bonnet about me. It’s not about money. We’ve let a goal in and now you’re digging out my contract. We’ll sort it out tomorrow.’

‘Anytime, anywhere,’ was his reply as we all stormed back out on the pitch to concede three more goals and get pasted.

There must’ve been at least a dozen cameras as I sat there at Upton Park. After what felt like forever, Harry Redknapp introduced us to the press.

‘Afternoon, thanks for coming. I’m pleased to be able to present our new signings. We have Paolo Di Canio,

Marc-Vivien Foe, Gavin Holligan and, er . . . what’s your name?’

I was utterly devastated.

But it came to him: ‘Er, Jim. Jimmy Bullard.’ The world knew my name. Fame and glory awaited.

All I had to do was get on the pitch; that proved to be a lot harder than I thought.

That night, I couldn’t sleep a wink. I was so angry. I wanted to kill Nick Barmby and that’s all I could think about.

The gaffer had decided we’d have our warm-down session out by the Humber Bridge, rather than pore over hours of video analysis.

We’d been there before, it’s a mile-and-a-half each way during which we’d do walking and jogging, then back to the club for ice baths and massages. I would certainly need cooling down when we got back.

I travelled to the bridge in my team-mate Richard Garcia’s car and he sensed something was up. But I barely noticed because I was focused on Barmby.

Richard parked and, as we got out, I spotted my nemesis and the red mist descended. ‘Come here you,’ I said. ‘We’ve got to have a word, haven’t we?’

As Nick walked towards me, I reached out to grab him and he threw a punch at my head straight away. Within seconds we were having a proper ding-dong, rolling around on the ground, trying to belt the c*** out of each other.

We were both throwing punches, but none really seemed to land. I was so full of anger and adrenaline that I probably wouldn’t have felt it if Nick had landed one in any case.

I’d love to be able to say that I sorted
 him out, but the truth is that it was little more than explosive 
grappling for a few seconds. As the gaffer said later, it was hardly 
Ali-Frazier. We both ended up lying on a bush with no real leverage to 
get out of it so loads of the boys dived in to split us up.

Steve Parkin, the assistant manager, walked me down the path, while the rest took Nick and headed in the opposite direction. Except nobody realised that this particular path followed a circular route, meaning that after a few minutes we all met up again.

As soon as I saw Barmby again, I launched myself at him. This time, he was protected by Amr Zaki and Kamil Zayatte, like two blocks of flats. I just bounced off them and had to call it a day.

Just when it seemed like things couldn’t have got any worse, the gaffer started receiving complaints from members of the WI.

They had called into the club and the local radio station, appalled by what they’d seen - and I don’t mean our wild (and wildly ineffective) fighting styles, which they would have had every right to criticise.
