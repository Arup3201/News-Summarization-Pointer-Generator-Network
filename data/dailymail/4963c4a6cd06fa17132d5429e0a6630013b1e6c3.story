It's all over as Argentina well and truly get their revenge against World Cup winner Germany with an impressive 4-2 win.

A stunning individual performance from Angel di Maria saw the United winger bag three assists and a goal and Sergio Aguero and Erik Lamela also scored.

Chelsea's Andre Schurrle responded for Germany but it was too little to late as Argentina raced into a 4-0 lead early on in the second half. 

91mins: We're into stoppage time in Dusseldorf now as Germany continue to push. Argentina have the ball on the halfway line though as Martino's side look to see out the game.

Gotze has given Germany an extra edge but it's been too little to late.

88mins: Germany are giving a final push as they look to continue their comeback and avoid what will be their first defeat in 15 months.

Mullers lofts the ball towards Gotze but he can't control the ball and lets it go out for an Argentina goal kick. 

85mins: Di Maria comes off for Sunderland new boy Ricardo Alvarez. The Manchester United new boy has had a brilliant evening and deservedly shares a joke with Martino as he leave the field.

Three assists and a goal. Louis van Gaal will take that against QPR next weekend. 

83mins: Aguero makes a powerful run but just lets the ball run away from his as substitute Antonio Rudiger clears the danger.

Gotze has done it again for Germany but his celebrations don't quite match those in Brazil two months ago.

Reus curled in a corner which the Argentina defence failed to deal with and the ball fell kindly for Gotze who smashed the ball home thanks to a large deflection.

75mins: Reus hits a fabulous right-footed strike from the left corner of Argentina's penalty area which crashes against Romero's left post before being cleared for a corner. 

73mins: It's all a bit stop and start now as a few tackles start flying in. Germany attack with Gotze before the move breaks down as Aguero drops deep to claim the ball.

70mins: Another change for Germany Kroos is replaced by Sebastian Rudy to earn his second cap.

68mins: Lamela makes way for Fernando Gago. The Tottenham man has done himself no harm with his performance tonight. Who knows? Maybe Lionel Messi will be looking over his shoulder...

62mins: Muller tries to thread the ball into the path of Gotze but Romero gathers gratefully. Straight after that, Fernandez robs Reus of the ball in the Argentina penalty area to give away a corner which is then cleared.  

58mins: Schurrle and Gomez make way for Gotze and Muller with almost 60 minutes played in Dusseldorf.

Can Gotze add to his World Cup heroics this evening? He's got his work cut out...

56mins: The players catch their breathe after a whirlwind start to the second half which saw three goals in seven minutes. Low is about to make some changes...

This is getting silly now. Germany win a corner at the other end before Schurrle pokes home after a scramble inside the Argentina box. Is the comeback on? 

Outstanding! Di Maria now has a goal to add to his hat-trick of assists. The Manchester United winger raced through on the right before delightfully chipping the ball over Weidenfeller. 

It's the worst possible start for Germany as Di Maria swings in a dangerous free-kick which Fernandez heads home to bag his third goal in an Argentina shirt. 

That's now three assists for Di Maria the £60million man.

We're back underway as Germany look to comeback from their 2-0 deficit. Argentina have looked clinical tonight while the World Cup winners have been extremely wasteful.

Germany won't want to celebrate their World Cup win with defeat here. Stay tuned...

Half-time change for Germany as captain for the evening Neuer comes off for Roman Weidenfeller. Podolski will skipper the side for the second half.

It's half-time in Dusseldorf and it's save to say Argentina are getting their revenge for the World Cup final defeat back in July.

Goals from Aguero and Lamela give Argentina a deserved two-goal lead at the break with Angel di Maria laying on both goals for his team-mates.

It may be a lot of money, but in today's marker, Di Maria is looking like a £60million player.

Another big opportunity falls Gomez's way and he's fluffed his lines for the third time. Kroos forces a save for Romero and the ball cannons back to Gomez who can only fire wide from six-yards out.    

It's 2-0 and Tottenham star Erik Lamela has doubled Argentina's lead. Di Maria picks up another assists as he finds too much space along the right.

The United winger crosses perfectly for Lamela who strokes the ball into the top corner with the inside of his left boot. Spurs fans will be happy with that one! 

37mins: Schurrle comes close for Germany as Kroos lofts in a delightful ball into the far post. The Chelsea forward controls the ball before volleying his shot just over Romero's crossbar. 

Rojo didn't get near him...

36mins: Di Maria bombs down the right once again as Durm struggles to keep pace with him. Unfortunately for Argentina, the winger can only fire his cross into the feet of Ginter.

33mins: It's an early bath for Draxler who seems to have picked up a hamstring injury as Arsenal forward Podolski replaces him.

28mins: Brilliant save from Romero as Gomez looked set to pull Germany back into the game. The big German found himself one-on-one with the Argentine keeper who stuck out his left leg to stop Gomez's shot brilliantly.

The strike came after fantastic work from Kramer, who jinked through the Argentina box before laying the ball off. 

22mins: Germany attempt to hit back as Kroos finds space on the edge of the box, but the German drags his shot slightly wide. 

Low doesn't look to pleased with his side's start...

And Argentina have the lead as Aguero volleys home at the far post. The ball fell to Di Maria on the righthand side and the Manchester United winger curled in a beautiful cross for Aguero to tap in.

17mins: Demichelis is shown a yellow card for a late challenge on Reus. Germany are controlling the tempo of the game so far and are more than happy to pick Argentina off on the counter. Still 0-0 though! 

13mins: Argentina are growing into the game, but the majority of the match is being played in midfielder.

Germany look to counter-attack with Schurrle who wins a corner, but it comes to nothing. 

7mins: Huge chance for Gomez to mark his return to the Germany first team with a goal after a brilliant through ball from Kroos left him in the clear. 

Romero stood his ground to save a tame effort from Gomez. 

At the other end, Di Maria fires a shot over the Germany bar. 

6mins: First attack for Germany as Durm bombs down the left before attempting to find Gomez in the box. 

The ball is cleared for a Germany corner which is eventually cleared.

3mins: As you'd expect it's a slow start to the game as each team takes turns in passing the ball along the back four.

Argentina's front three look lively though as Aguero is fouled by Reus in the centre circle.

We're underway in Dusseldorf as Argentina take kick-off. Can Gerardo Martino's side take revenge for their World Cup final defeat or will a new wave of Germany youngsters prove too strong tonight? 

Stay here to find out...

It's national anthem time and the Argentina players don't seem too happy about being in Germany tonight for what seems like an extended World Cup winning party...

There's a few big hugs being spread around in Dusseldorf as Germany say goodbye to a number national team legends.

Klose, Mertesacker and Philipp Lahm have all  retired and are receiving special shirts and photographs as the sold out stadium gives each player a brilliant ovation.  

It's no doubt something the Germany fans and players will have been excited about. They will be walking out at the Esprit Arena with four stars above their famous crest as Germany rightfully commemorate their 2014 World Cup win. 

There's certainly one for Manchester United fans to keep an eye on tonight as Premier League new boy starts for Argentina.

Di Maria signed for a £60million British record fee during the summer and will line-up alongside Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Manchester City's Sergio Aguero.

Germany: Neuer; Grosskreutz, Ginter, Howedes, Durm; Kramer, Kroos, Schurrle, Reus, Draxler; Gomez.

Argeninta: Romero, Zabaleta, Fernandez, Demichelis, Rojo, Perez, Mascherano, Biglia, Lamela, Di Maria, Aguero
