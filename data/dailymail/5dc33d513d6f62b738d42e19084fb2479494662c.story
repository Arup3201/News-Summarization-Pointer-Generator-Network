Her sculptures may be wooden, but artist Stefanie Rocknak's creations are anything but lifeless as these beautifully detailed pictures show.

From a cyclist with veins standing out on his arms, to a face contorted in fear, Rocknak, who is also a professor of philosophy, hand carves each figure when she is not busy in the classroom.

While a basic design can take just a few days to complete, more detailed work can take anything up to a month and a half to finish.

Sculptor Stephanie Rocknak takes anywhere between a few days and a month and a half to create wonderfully detailed wooden designs such as this one, called The King

Made from two pieces of basswood, one for the body, head and crown, and another for the hands, The King was displayed in the windows of Saks on 5th Avenue, New York

The figure, which was completed in February 2008, was inspired by exhibits in the National Portrait Gallery in London, and the National War Museum in Warsaw, Poland

This piece, The Queen, was finished in August 2010 and designed as a counterpart to The King. The figure is also made from basswood, and her crown is made from many pieces slotted together

Her work has been exhibited all over the world, and a statue of Edgar Allan Poe she designed will take pride of place in Edgar Allan Square in Boston after it is unveiled in October.

The brass figure beat 265 other entries from 42 and 13 countries to win the commission, and is designed to look as if Poe has just stepped off the train to visit his parents.

Her sculptures have also been displayed in the Smithsonian, the windows of Sak's on 5th avenue, and in the Marinerâ€™s Museum, on the Hudson River Sloop.

Rocknak can spend up to 1,000 hours getting the details of a sculpture just right, such as the delicate floral designs which run down The Queen's sleeves and the garlands around her neck

The Biker sculpture was created from two pieces of wood in 2005 and was one piece in a three-part commission called The Triathlete, which included a runner and a swimmer

The arms on the rider show the level of detail that goes into Rocknak's work, with his veins, sinewy muscle and wristwatch all painstakingly carved out

Rocknak was artistic from a young age, 
training as a painter, before travelling to Rome in 1987 where she was 
inspired by the likes of Michelangelo, Dontatello and Bernini and turned
 to sculpture instead.

While she intended to become a stone sculptor, she started working in wood first as her mother used to refurbish wood furniture, her father was a carpenter, and her grandfather had a wood shop in his ship yard.

She always intended to start using stone, but fell in love 'the warmth and unpredictability of the wood,' and never went back.

The Swimmer was part of the same commission. Speaking about the work, Rocknak said she was interested in capturing people in motion, as she found posed characters uninteresting

The Swimmer was carved from a single piece of wood and formed part of a three-part collection, which included The Rider. The third part, The Runner, was a huge runner's leg, also made from basswood

Rocknak says her art is deliberately simple to understand, and aims to be visually rich and detailed rather than intellectually complex or conceptual

Steering 
away from modern 'conceptual' art which Rocknak says is often 
overly-complex, she aims to create figures which are 'immediate and 
obvious; ideally, they do not need a theory to do their talking.'

One
 of her commissions, The Triathlete, featured three figures including a 
bike rider, a swimmer and a giant runner's leg to represent the three 
stages of a race.

At
 the time she was creating the work, Rocknak said she preferred creating
 figures in motion as she found 'posed' figures uninteresting.

Rocknak says she was inspired by stone masters such a Michelangelo and Donatello but chose to work in wood as her father was a carpenter and her mother used to repair wooden furniture

Rocknak also uses her talents to capture human emotions in wooden sculptures. This piece is simply called Terrified and captures a wide-eyed woman with her head thrown back in fear

This work, called Ghastly Nights, captures a woman's fear and frustration which keep her awake
