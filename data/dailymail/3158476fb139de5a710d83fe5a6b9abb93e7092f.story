Alex Rodriguez should have taken the advice given to him earlier this season by Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman.

The controversial Yankees' rant against his team and Major League Baseball has caused the league to reject Rodriguez's request to negotiate and will cost the mouthy third baseman at least 214 games, according to a report. A lifetime ban is also still being considered. His ranting came only weeks after Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman infamously told ESPN that 'Alex should just shut the f--k up.'

Rodriguez is reported to have been rebuffed when he reached out to the league to negotiate a settlement only hours after declaring he is 'mentally prepared to play for five more years' and boasting that he 'will keep fighting.’

Five more years: New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez believes he can play five more years - despite the threat of a lifetime ban

Perhaps emboldened by a third inning home run, Rodriguez shot himself in the foot with Friday's ranting, even being rejected by Yankees officials he contacted Saturday to try to reach a settlement on the remainder of his contract, the New York Daily News reported Saturday afternoon.

League officials are said to have been angered by Rodriguez insinuating his team and the league were conspiring against him, according to the Daily News, which explained the aging player will be suspended for violating the drug agreement collectively bargained between MLB and the player's union, as well as for violating the 'just cause' provision of the agreement by interfering with and lying to investigators regarding both his involvement in Biogenesis and his use of PEDs.

Rodriguez is widely expected to appeal any suspension - which would allow him to play until the case is heard by an arbitrator. Rodriguez next takes the field Saturday night in what should be his final rehab game in Trenton.

The only way to stop Rodriguez from joining the Yankees in Chicago on Monday would be if Selig issues a lifetime ban, which 'still appears to be in play,' according to Yankees beat reporter Mark Feinsand.

Perhaps Rodriguez should have taken Cashman's advice, or at least considered it before accusing the league and the Yankees of a conspiracy and boasting that he'd play for five more years. Cashman's comments came in June after A-Rod declared himself medically cleared and ready to play on Twitter.

Alluding to the belief that he is being 
singled out by Major League Baseball, Rodriguez said ‘I think it’s 
pretty self-explanatory. I think that’s the pink elephant in the room,’ 
before adding that he agrees the game needs to be rid of PEDs. Rodriguez
admitted to using steroids while with the Texas Rangers, but has denied
using PEDs since joining the Yankees in 2004.

‘I will say this, there’s more than one party that benefits from me never stepping back on the field. That’s not my teammates and not the Yankee fans,’ said Rodriguez. The latest allegations claim the 14-time all-star used PEDs as far back as at least 2010.

But Rodriguez didn’t stop there, with his next comments aimed squarely at the Yankees, the team that owes him more than $100million over the next four years.

‘But when all this stuff is going on in the background, and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract, that’s concerning for me, concerning for present and I think it should be concerning for future players, as well,’ said Rodriguez.

His comments came after his first minor league rehab game as he races to come back from both off-season hip surgery and a strained quad before MLB Commissioner Bud Selig suspends him, which reports indicate will happen no later than next week.

Stepping onto the field, there was an even mixture of boos and cheers from the 8,000-plus crowd on hand against the Reading Fightin Phils, a minor league affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. Rodriguez attributed the Bronx cheer to his role in helping the Yankees beat the Phillies in the 2009 World Series.

‘I think there were a lot of Phillies fans out there, and they don't have good memories from me,’ said Rodriguez, perhaps half-jokingly.

The suspension hanging over Rodriguez is a result of his alleged involvement with Biogenesis, a South Florida anti-aging clinic MLB investigators have accused of selling PEDs such as steroids and human growth hormone to a list of athletes long enough field an all-star team on its own.

Varying reports say anywhere from eight to 14 other players are expected to be suspended in connection with Biogenesis. The suspensions were due to be announced by the end of this week, but the latest reports say the axe will fall in the next two or three days.

At the same time, the Yankees have publicly stated their plan is to have the 19-year veteran Rodriguez in their lineup Monday against the Chicago White Sox.

‘I think it’s possible, yeah,’ manager Joe Girardi said in San Diego when asked if the embattled slugger would return to the lineup.

Rodriguez was a bit more jovial in his answer to the same question, saying he’d be in the lineup ‘unless I get hit by lightning, and these days you never know.’

A-Rod was set to join the Yankees in July when his strained quad delayed his return to the Bronx, an injury he openly contested in the media. The move backfired when the doctor his handlers picked turned out to have been in trouble with New Jersey officials earlier this year. 

Rodriguez, in the end, accepted the rehabilitation assignment, Friday’s game in Trenton was the first game of his assigned rehab.

The league’s highest-paid player, at $28million per season, it has been widely reported since at least last season that the Yankees were trying to figure out how to get out from under the ill-advised contract owing him more than $100 million over the next four seasons.

Current Baltimore Orioles Manager Buck Showalter – himself a former Yankees manager – went so far as to say the league is perhaps even conspiring with the team to deal with A-Rod, saying that if the Yankees are allowed to ‘get away with that,’ they will go on another spending spree snagging big name free agents as they have in the past.

There are two schools of thought on what Selig may do with A-Rod. One has him using the ‘best interest of the game’ power afforded him as commissioner to ban the suspected cheater for life. The other has Selig and Rodriguez agreeing to a settlement that would see the beleaguered player sit out the rest of this season and all of 2014, which at 38 years old, would effectively end A-Rod’s career.

Selig’s endgame is to have Rodriguez never step on the field again, Rodriguez sees a different outcome.

‘I’m ready to go. I feel 100%,’ Rodriguez said. ‘A night like tonight illustrates to me that I can play now and I can play for a long time.’
