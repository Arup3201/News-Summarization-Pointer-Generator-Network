Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench have joined stars from Downton Abbey to campaign for an end of the brutal Thai practice of torturing and slaughtering dogs for meat.

The celebrities feature in a short video calling for action against the dog meat trade in Thailand, which often involves family pets being stolen from their homes and ending up on restaurant dinner tables.

'I didn't know that these animals were caught up in this hideous crime' Gervais says. 'I didn't know about this unimaginable cruelty and neither do the majority of the people of Thailand.'

Dame Judi Dench describes the dogs' terrifying and torturous journey to the abattoir. 

She says: 'I didn't know that these innocent creatures are crammed into cages so brutally that their bones often break, so tightly that they can't move. And that they're trapped like this for the smuggled journeys that can take days.'

'I didn't know how many of them suffocate crushed by the weight of the others,' adds Downton's Peter Egan. 'That the ones who survive the long journey will have gone for days without water in unbearable heat.

The stars are working with the Soi Dog Foundation for the campaign, which was launched nearly a year ago and has been gaining momentum on social media.

Describing the practice as Thailand's 'dark and tragic secret', Downton's Penelope Wilton says: 'I didn't know that these desperate dogs are killed illegally for their meat. 

'That they are killed in tortuous ways. That quite often their fur is removed while they're still conscious.'

Downton's Laura Carmichael adds: 'I didn't know that thousands of dogs are grabbed from the streets. That many of them are stolen family pets.'

Soi Dog Foundation explains that the dogs are often skinned  alive due to 'the barbaric belief that when they are in pain, their bodies release adrenaline that softens their meat'.

As the video draws to a close, Gervais says that many of the dogs are rescued and sent to shelters in north east Thailand.

But he adds that these shelters receive no government funding so desperately need support and funding in order to continue their work.

Soi Dog Foundation  has launched a petition calling on Thailand’s leaders to crack down on dog meat traders and put an end to the barbaric industry, which has attracted nearly 400,000 signatures so far.
