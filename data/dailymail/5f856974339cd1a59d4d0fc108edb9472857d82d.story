A high-profile homeowners association scandal in Nevada claimed more victims when two key figures in the case were found dead this week.

Attorney David Amesbury, 57, who had cut a deal with federal investigators in a far-reaching investigation, was found dead from apparent hanging at his brother's home in Grass Valley, California. Amesbury's brother found him hanging in a shed.

His death comes just days after Nancy Quon, 51, a construction defect lawyer, committed suicide in the bathtub of her Henderson, Nevada condominium. Her body was found by a relative.

Tragedy: David Amesbury and Nancy Quon, both implicated in a federal homeowners association probe, died of apparent suicide this week

The investigation had already claimed two other lives. Former police lieutenant Chris Van 
Cleef shot himself dead in 2008 shortly after an FBI raid in the 
investigation, and Robbie Castro, a Visitana, Nevada, homeowners 
association board member, also died from a drug overdose in 2010.

A U.S. Justice Department investigation 
alleges that, starting in 2008, Amesbury and nine other defendants 
helped take over homeowner association boards through rigged elections 
and then steered legal and construction contracts to specific firms.

Quon, a single mother, was a major player in the scheme, federal officials say, but had not yet been indicted by prosecutors.

Autopsy results for Quon won't be made 
public until blood toxicology test results are known, according to the 
Clark County Coroner's office.

Quon had previously tried to commit suicide, police say.

'I know of no specific reason why he would have done this,' Frank Cremen, Amesbury's defense lawyer, told ABC News.

'I know his family doesn't believe it was suicide,' he added.

Another defense attorney in the federal case says the recent deaths are creating anxiety among those named in the probe.

The U.S. Justice Department alleges 10 defendants found 'straw purchasers' to 
buy condominiums and run for seats on the homeowner boards.

The 
'straw buyers,' who were elected board members by forging documents and 
digging up dirt on other board candidates, pretended to be legitimate 
buyers but were colluding with other defendants in the case.

Once on the boards of these homeowner associations, members lobbied for construction defect lawsuits against builders and then steered legal and construction contracts to preferred firms.

'Some of the witnesses are extremely 
concerned about their well-being and safety," the defense lawyer told 
the Las Vegas Review Journal.

Amesbury and Quon are the third and fourth victims connected to the homeowners association scandal.

"All of these deaths are just too much 
of a coincidence,"Â  Wanda Murray, a former Vistana board member,' told the Review Journal. 'None of them make sense to
 any of us.'

Amesbury, 57, a Las Vegas attorney, had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and bank fraud charges

Federal officials claim Amesbury received $3,000 from other conspirators to help rig homeowner board elections by creating fake ballots that would allow their candidate to win.

Amesbury reached a deal with federal authorities on Oct. 24, pleading guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, according to U.S. Justice Department documents.

Shortly after the plea agreement, Amesbury was found shirtless and with his pants at his ankles on a Henderson, Nevada, street.

He had been severely beaten.

'He was really beaten to a pulp,' the source close to the investigation said. 'He had two broken ribs, and both his kneecaps were shattered. He also had a variety of facial injuries.'

Amesbuey, who had 30 Valium pills on him at the time, told police officials that he 'planned to commit suicide or try to,' according to ABC News.

Amesbury also admitted to prosecutors that he had previously participated in a separate scheme that involved defrauding banks while seeking refinancing as owner of a Clark County courthouse cafe.

Quon and her former police officer boyfriend, William Ronald Webb Jr., were also fighting a legal battle against state prosecutors over criminal drug conspiracy, arson and insurance fraud charges, according to the Review Journal.

Prosecutors say the two were involved in a botched arson-murder-suicide scheme that fell apart after Quon was found unconscious in her burning home in October 2010.

Ten defendants have pleaded guilty in the homeowners association case so far, and prosecutors plan to name up to 20 new defendants soon, according to federal documents.
