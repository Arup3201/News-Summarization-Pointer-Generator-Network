A crazed woman had to be restrained by fellow air passengers after she started raging about having an explosive device implanted within her.

The terrifying incident forced the pilot of U.S. Airways flight 787, traveling from Paris to Charlotte, North Carolina, to divert and make an emergency landing.

Fighter jets were scrambled to intercept the the troubled plane and guided it into land at a Maine airport, where passengers were evacuated and the woman arrested.

Cut-short: Passengers were evacuated from the plane and the woman arrested. Three-and-a-half hours later they were allowed back on and the plane continued its journey

In video footage given to ABC passengers can be seen wrestling with the woman following her potentially fatal claim, initially made in a note to cabin crew.

She is French citizen, born in Cameroon, Africa, who was set to visit the U.S. for 10 days, CNN reported, but had no checked luggage.

Doctors on board the flight examined her, but found no evidence of wounds or scars that would indicate recent surgery, according to the news channel.

US officials told NBC that initial reports suggested the passenger, a woman, appeared to be mentally unstable.

Officials told CBS she will be taken for medical evaluation and likely faces federal charges of interfering with a flight crew.

Evacuation: Video footage captured buses on the tarmac near the plane

Andrew Kobayashi, a passenger on board at the time, told CNN that crew at first said the unexpected landing was due to a fuel issue and strong headwinds. The pilot later apologised for the misleading annoucnement.

Kobayashi was sitting five rows in front of the woman who was arrested and recalled her as looking 'nervous and jittery'. The airport manager described her behaviour as 'unruly'.

Another passenger, 20-year-old student Alexa Moore, also seated five rows in front, was returning from a mission in Africa.

Moore said she had noticed the woman get up to go to the bathroom holding her stomach and recalled several announcements asking if there was a doctor on board.

A short time later the pilot announced they were low on fuel and would be diverting, she said.

'We didn't know what was going on,' she told the news channel, describing 'jaws-dropping' as police officers boarded the plane.

'I thought she probably had like some drugs on the plane but it was just like crazy. I was pretty shocked.'

Emergency: The plane was traveling from Paris, France to Charlotte, North Carolina but had to be diverted to Bangor, Maine

U.S. Airways flight 787 was diverted due to a security issue

Security at airports was stepped up after al Qaeda claimed to have developed surgically implanted explosive devices.

Officials believed terrorists may use the bombs in attempt to blow up planes on the eve of Osama bin Laden's death.

Notorious chief bomb maker Ibrahim al-Asiri claimed to be behind the bombs that would evade airport scanners.

al-Asiri was responsible for building the underwear bomb used to try to bring down a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas 2009.

He also created and the printer-cartridge bombs intercepted in U.S.-bound cargo planes a year later.

It is not known whether the arrested woman had any links to a terrorist organisation but it was enough to spark panic in the wake of recent reports that al Qaeda has been trying to make such devices.

The plane had to be diverted following the woman's outburst at around 12 noon, as it moved over Nova Scotia, Canada, touching down in Bagnor, Maine which is two hours from its intended destination.

The North American Aerospace Defense confirmed that two F15 aircraft had been dispatched to help with the plane's landing.

It had departed from Charles de Gaulle airport at around 11am local time and was due to touch down in Charlotte Douglas International at around 2.30pm.

There were 179 passengers and nine crew members on board the Boeing 767 when it was forced to make its emergency landing.

Video footage captured buses on the tarmac near the plane as passengers were evacuated.

'[We are] aware of reports of a passenger who exhibited suspicious behavior during flight,' the Transport Security Administration said in a statement.

'Out of an abundance of caution the flight was diverted to BGR where it was met by law enforcement.'

Once the woman had been taken into custody passengers were allowed back on the plane and it was cleared to resume after about three-and-a-half hours, officials said.

Authorities investigating why the woman made the bizarre claim have said there were no explosives on her body.
