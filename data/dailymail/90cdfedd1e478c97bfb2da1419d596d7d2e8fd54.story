A Mexican woman who claimed to be pregnant with nine babies is not expecting and is simply clinically obese, health officials have said.

They have also revealed it would be impossible for Karla Vanessa Perez to be carrying nonuplets because her fallopian tubes have been removed.

The 32-year-old has also been branded a liar for saying she'd given birth to triplets just weeks before conceiving her 'new record-breaking brood'.

Proud father: Karla does have three children with mechanic husband Juan Bernardo Garcia Morales, but they are four, 12 and 15-years-old

She does have three children with car mechanic husband Juan Bernardo Garcia Morales - but they are four, 12 and 15-years-old.

Doctor José Salvador Gallegos Mata told El Diario de Coahuila: 'Everything is a crude joke, hatched by a person with an evident and 
urgent need to say, "Here I am! Come and see me! I exist!'

'Humanly and scientifically a pregnancy of nine would only be possible through IVF.

'But never through natural methods, and even less so when a woman who has undergone a salpingectomy (the surgical removal of the Fallopian tubes she had following the birth of her youngest child).

'This woman needs urgent psychiatric help, because now the hoax has 
been discovered she will not know how to confront it, how to solve the 
problem she has created.

'She will become terribly depressed, which could lead to her hurting herself and, at a given time, could try to commit suicide'.

While the absence of Fallopian tubes does not always prevent pregnancy, Perez's claimed lack of IVF treatment and the number of babies expected would make it a huge improbability.

Perez stunned the world when, last week, she claimed she was due to give birth on May 20 to six girls and three boys.

Initial doubts were cast after another 
local doctor came forward and said she recently performed an ultra-sound
 on and her uterus was empty.

Home: Nonamum, as she has been dubbed, is from the northeastern state of Coahuila, which borders Texas

But Perez, from the north-eastern state of Coahuila, insisted she was being treated for the pregnancy at a hospital in Saltillo.

She told Notimex: 'It's very early to think of names for the babies. First I hope that everything goes well.'  

The successful delivery of the now 'phantom nonuplets' would have been one of the highest multiple births ever recorded.

In 2009, a woman in California gave birth to octuplets, sparking worldwide media attention.

Mother-of-14 Nadya Suleman, 36, from La Habra, was dubbed 'Octomum' has since become a television personality in the U.S.

However, since the birth of her eight new children she has faced problems and been close to being evicted from her home.

Her children are now being monitored by officials with the California Children's Services Department.

* EDITOR'S NOTE - While there is clearly room for debate about
the correct grammatical term for a woman who has nine children, the classicists
at MailOnline have insisted on using the ordinal Latin term, nona, meaning
ninth, rather than the cardinal alternative, novem, meaning nine, or indeed the
Greek, ennea.

A set of nonuplets was born on June 13, 1971 in Sydney, Australia, to Geraldine Brodrick. None of the five boys and four girls lived. Two were stillborn and the last to survive died six days after birth.

Nonuplets were also born on March 26, 1999, in Malaysia to Zurina Mat Saad. She had five boys and four girls (Adam, Nuh, Idris, Soleh, Hud, Aishah, Khadijah, Fatimah and Umi Kalsom) but none of them survived more than six hours.

Nadya Suleman - or 'Octomum' - holds the world record for the most children delivered at a single birth to survive with her eight babies.

Before that, the record was held by Bobbie McCaughey, who gave birth to four boys and three girls in 1997 at the University hospital, Iowa in United State of America.

The greatest recorded number of children born to one mother in the world, according to Guinness is 69. In 27 pregnancies, the first wife of Feodor Vassilyev of Russia gave birth to 16 pairs of twins, 7 sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets in the 17th century.
