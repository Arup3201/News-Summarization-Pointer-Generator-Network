West Ham are keen to take Wilfried Zaha if Manchester United agree to let the 21-year-old leave. 

Zaha's future at United is in doubt after new manager Louis van Gaal said he only sees the England international as a striker in his new 3-5-2 formation. 

With Robin Van Persie, Wayne Rooney, Javier Hernandez and Danny Welbeck already established at Old Trafford, Van Gaal may allow Zaha to leave.

West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is open to either a loan move or a permanent deal, with much depending on how much United ask for. 

West Ham have been linked with Samuel Eto'o but Allardyce is keen to push for Zaha as he searches for younger strikers to boost his options. Crystal Palace - who Zaha played for before signing for United for £15million - are also monitoring the situation.

Zaha impressed in United's pre-season win over Inter Milan but was less effective in the victory over Real Madrid on Saturday. 

Zaha fell out of favour last season under David Moyes and spent the second of the season on loan at Cardiff. 

Allardyce has also made enquiries about HNK Rijeka striker Andrej Kramaric, 23, who scored 21 goals in 23 games for the Croatian side last season.
