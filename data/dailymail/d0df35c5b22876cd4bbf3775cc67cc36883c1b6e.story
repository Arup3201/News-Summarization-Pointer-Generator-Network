A central Pennsylvania man will serve 28 to 56 years behind bars for suffocating his girlfriend after she survived his deliberate, high-speed crash.

Lancaster Online reports Benjamin Klinger pleaded guilty to third-degree murder and was sentenced Friday.

Authorities say Klinger was physically and verbally abusive to 17-year-old Samantha Heller during their turbulent relationship.

In December 2012, prosecutors say Klinger intentionally sped into a guardrail at over 100 mph.

Police say he sat on Heller after she lived through the wreck near Manheim.

A truck driver who came upon the 2am crash heard Heller hanging outside the window and screaming, 'Get off of me!' but was told by 911 operators not to move the crash victims.

When police arrived, Klinger was sitting on top of Heller's head and torso, according to the arrest affidavit.

'Klinger was observed by the officers to be what appeared as 'slipping in and out of consciousness,' because he would close his eyes for several seconds, moan, and then reopen his eyes while continuing to be positioned on top of the victim's head and torso while the victim was face down,' police wrote.

Based on medical records, investigators later concluded Klinger was pretending to be unconscious.

An autopsy perform of Heller's body has revealed that the teen died from multiple injuries and asphyxiation.

Dr. Wayne Ross, who performed the autopsy, concluded 'the cause of death is consistent with someone sitting on (Heller).'

Detectives recovered marijuana, cash, a digital scale, a pipe, pills and a black air pistol from the wreckage. 

The 21-year-old Klinger apologized in court and said he takes 'full responsibility for the loss of a very special person.'

He wept as he apologized, which Judge Margaret Miller said was the the first she'd seen 'any degree of humanity or emotion' in Klinger.

The victim's mother, Sandy McFalls, says her heart has been shattered.

'I want you to have nothing else to do (in prison) but think about how you took her life and destroyed ours,' McFalls said in a statement to the court, reported LancasterOnline.

Klinger's sentence includes time for a drug charge and for sending sexually explicit photos of a minor.
