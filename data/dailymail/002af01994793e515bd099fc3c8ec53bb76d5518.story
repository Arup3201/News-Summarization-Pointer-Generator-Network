A teenager wants to ‘clear his slate’ after allegedly burgling 278 homes and stealing 60 cars since he was 12.

Adam Crampton, 19, has been a ‘prolific’ one man crimewave, especially in the Leicester area where up to 200 of the burglaries took place.

He pleaded guilty to three specimen counts of burglary at Leicester Magistrates’ Court recently but has asked that a further 278 break-ins and 60 car thefts be taken into consideration when he is sentenced later this month.

Crampton, of no fixed address, revealed the full extent of his criminal history in interviews with police at a young offenders’ institution earlier this year as he began a four-year sentence for robbery and burglary offences in March.

He even took officers on tours of Leicester four times, pointing out homes he had targeted.

Inspector Andy Parkes, of Leicester Police said: ‘Victims want to know that someone has been caught and held responsible for crimes committed against them. This man was very young when he began and has been prolific.

‘One of the aims of the criminal justice system is to help people turn their lives around and hopefully this is the beginning of that process for him.’

Steve Morris, defending, said: ‘He has volunteered the information to get things cleared up and he wants to do this as soon as possible.’

Sylvia Hammond, one of his earliest victims, told of her relief at discovering the identity of her intruder.

Crampton stole a laptop, a phone and a digital camera from Mrs Hammond’s home in Oakham, Rutland, in July 2007.

The 60-year-old said: ‘It did cause great upset at the time.

Clear up crimes: Prosecutor Ian Johnson told Leicester Magistrates' Court that Crampton 'indicated he wanted to clear up all of his outstanding crimes'. He will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court (pictured) on October 23

‘If he is only 19 now he must have been 
very young then, only a child but it’s comforting to know who did it and
also that the police have never given up even after all these years.

‘You hear that a lot of people in prison go back to their old ways when they are released. I just hope he doesn’t, now that he has admitted all of these crimes.’

Prosecutor Ian Johnson told the court: ‘He was sentenced to four years in March this year for offences of robbery and dwelling house burglary.

‘He was visited by police officers and he indicated he wanted to clear up all of his outstanding crimes.’

Crampton will be sentenced at Leicester Crown Court on October 23.
