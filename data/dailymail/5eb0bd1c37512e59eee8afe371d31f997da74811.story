A man wanted in connection with the murder of a 6-year-old girl in Louisiana has been arrested.

Ahlittia North was found in a dumpster in Harvey, Louisiana, the early hours of Tuesday with multiple stab wounds to her body.

Late Tuesday night, Matter Flugence, the nephew of Ahlittia's stepfather was located and apprehended after he was spotted by a patrol deputy and two Westwego Police Department officers.

Flugence, who had reportedly babysat Ahlittia on several occasions, was carrying a knife when he was arrested.

She was reported missing on Saturday 
morning when her mother Lisa North, 20, and stepfather Albert Hill, 46, 
discovered she had gone from her bedroom in Harvey, Louisiana.

Authorities said someone also took her brown and plaid comforter, a toothbrush and toothpaste.

Police combed the area surrounding the family's apartment at the weekend but no trace of the child was found.

The trash can had already been searched over the weekend and investigators are trying to determine when the body was disposed of there.

The dumpster was searched again after DNA tests showed that a pool of blood found on Monday  was that of the missing girl.

Ahlittia had been stabbed in the abdomen and had 
two 'very aggressive' stab wounds to her neck which were likely fatal, 
the coroner reported.

Ms
North said Jefferson Parish authorities contacted her in the early 
hours of Tuesday to say that her daughter's body had been found nearby.

The distraught mother told the Times-Picayune: 'They could have brought her back home, but they killed her and put her in a trash can.'

On Monday, police said they were seeking 20-year-old Matthew Flugence as a person of interest. Flugence is the nephew of the girl's stepfather.

He is wanted in connection with the alleged sexual battery of an 11-year-old girl in the neighborhood, nola.com reported.

His brother Russell has been arrested over obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation today.

Detectives went door to door in the early
hours of Tuesday to ask neighbors if they had heard anything suspicious. Both FBI 
and sheriff's officials were at the scene on Tuesday.

It wasn't clear early whether investigators had previously searched the dumpster where the body was found.

Neighbors and friends have been gathering near the family's home since early this morning to hold a vigil, leaving flowers, notes and teddy bears in memory of the little girl. 

A cause of death has not been confirmed but an autopsy is set to take place today.

Sheriff's office spokesman Colonel John Fortunato declined to comment until a news conference scheduled for 3pm on Tuesday (CT).
