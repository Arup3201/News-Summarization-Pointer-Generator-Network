It was lauded as an event that would 'inspire a generation', but just a year after the London Olympics came to a dramatic climax new Government figures show the number of youngsters participating in sport has actually fallen.

A survey of 2,000 children carried out by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport has revealed nearly 75 per cent of under 10s had not been inspired to take up a sport in the after glow of the Games.

The picture was slightly better for youngsters aged between 11 and 15, but even then fewer than half had been moved to get active.

Worrying: Despite the Government's hope the London Olympics would encourage youngsters to take up sport, figures show fewer are now participating

Inspiration: The Government had hoped scenes such as Jessica Ennis winning the 800m to take gold in the heptathlon would encourage youngsters to take up sport

Worryingly for the Government, the figures showed there had actually been a decline in the number of children involved in sport across all age groups over the past five years.

A report published in The Daily Telegraph claimed 25 per cent of girls aged between five and 10 had not participated in a sport in the past month - an increase of 17 per cent on the figure five years ago.

One in seven boys of the same age had not participated either.

And the number of children doing gymnastics, playing rounders or going swimming has also fallen away.

It has led to accusations that a lack of funding has led to fewer opportunities for children to participate in sport at school.

Legacy: Shadow sports minister Clive Efford has accused the Government of having 'no intention' of leaving a legacy. Right, golden girl heptathlete Jessica Ennis

The Coalition pulled the plug on the annual Â£162 million School Sports Partnership scheme after coming to power.

Shadow sports minister Clive Efford said: 'The Government had no intention at all of delivering a sports' legacy on the back of 2012.'

But a Government spokesman denied this, saying: 'We are completely committed to getting more young people participating in regular sport.'

Household name: The Games catapulted the likes of double gold medalist Mo Farah into the spotlight, but with seemingly little effect on youngsters
