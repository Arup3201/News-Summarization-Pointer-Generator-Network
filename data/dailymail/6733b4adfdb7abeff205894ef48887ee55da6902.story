Tories accused church leaders of playing politics last night for using their Easter messages to attack the Government over poverty and ‘sinful’ cuts.

In his sermon, the Archbishop of Canterbury highlighted the plight of struggling families ‘left broken and weeping’ by hunger and debt.

He told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral: ‘In this country, even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt.’

The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said in his sermon: 'Even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families'

And the Bishop of Truro the Right Reverend Tim Thornton spoke of the ‘sinful consequences’ of the squeeze on local authority budgets.

The bishop, who sits on a committee looking at food banks, told Radio 5 Live: ‘Politicians have to decide how to allocate resources.

And in allocating some resources, you are then inevitably taking away from other people.

Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes said last night: 'Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance'

‘I am not saying it’s a sin. I am saying that some of these policies lead to effects and consequences which have sinful elements in them.’

The bishops’ comments come amid growing unease over the use of political messages by figures in the Church of England.

Last week saw a letter signed by 600 church leaders, including 36 Anglican bishops, calling on the Government to tackle what it called a ‘national crisis’ of hunger and poverty.

The letter cited the rise of food banks as evidence that ‘unfair and harsh benefits sanctions’ were causing people to go hungry.

But the claims contradict findings by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development showing food poverty in Britain has reduced.

Many argue there will always be an almost unlimited demand for food that is given away for free and that it does not necessarily mean people are going hungry.

Last night Enfield Southgate MP David Burrowes, chairman of the Conservative Christian Fellowship, said: ‘I don’t remember church leaders in years gone by talking about the huge debt mountain this Government inherited, or talking positively about the number of people now back in work.

‘Of course church leaders can comment on politics, but they should get an appropriate balance.

David Cameron’s statement that Britain is a Christian country risks dividing society, a group of leading public figures has warned.

More than 50 writers, scientists, broadcasters and academics have signed an open letter expressing concern at the ‘negative consequences’ of his assertion.

Signatories include authors Philip Pullman and Sir Terry Pratchett, broadcasters Dan Snow and Nick Ross, philosopher AC Grayling, and human rights activist Peter Tatchell.

Last week the Prime Minister wrote in the Church Times of his own faith and his desire to infuse politics with Christian ideals and values.

But the letter says: ‘Repeated surveys, polls, and studies show most of us as individuals are not Christian in our beliefs or our religious identities...  To constantly claim otherwise fosters alienation and division in our society.’

'It cheapens the message of Easter if you engage in party politics.’

Fellow Tory Douglas Carswell, the MP for Clacton, said: ‘You can’t criticise debt from the pulpit and then have a go at a Government that is trying to do something about it.’

Archbishop Welby left himself open to accusations of hypocrisy after it emerged yesterday that the Church of England still has financial interests in Wonga.

The Archbishop lambasted the payday loan company last year, only for it to be revealed that the church’s pension fund had invested money in one of the high-interest lender’s financial backers.

Church Commissioners continue to hold shares in the firm worth around £90,000.

But in a newspaper interview on Saturday Archbishop Welby dismissed the issue, saying he had not acted because he had ‘a million other things to do’ and was not an ‘investment manager’.
