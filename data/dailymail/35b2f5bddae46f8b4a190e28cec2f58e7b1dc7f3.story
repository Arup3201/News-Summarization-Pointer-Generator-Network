Nearly 100 lawmakers have now come out in favor of placing travel restrictions in order to decrease the odds that someone who is infected with Ebola will be able to enter the U.S.

At least 80 members of the House and 20 senators have said they would like the president ban flights that have carrying passengers coming out of West Africa or temporarily rescind the visas of residents of Ebola stricken nations.

President Barack Obama said on Thursday evening that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban, but he believes 'a flat-out travel ban is not the way to go.'

The White House clarified on Friday that if the president believed such a move would be in the interest of the public's safety, 'he wouldn't hesitate to do that.'

The president's spokesman, Josh Earnest, said Friday that Obama's remarks last night after a meeting with health officials indicate that he is willing to 'keep an open mind' about how to address the Ebola crisis.

He then noted: 'At this point, if our core priority is protecting the American public, then we're not going to put in place a travel ban.' 

Earnest later claimed that a moratorium on travel into the U.S. from Ebola hot spots 'will continue to be on the table' even though it's not something that is 'being considered right now.'

The White House Press Secretary claimed that the screening measures at airports are working and the government has had a '100 percent success rate' of preventing people who are showing symptoms of Ebola from getting into the U.S.

That, Earnest, said, is the purpose of the screenings, and by that standard the current policies and procedures have been a great success.

'If it is assessed that there might be other aspects of our travel policies that would strengthen the health and security of the American public, then the president won't just consider them, he'll implement them,' he later explained.

'If he concluded that an all out travel ban actually would be in the best interest of protecting the health and safety of the American public, if circumstances change on the ground in a way that an all out travel ban needed to be implemented, the president wouldn't hesitate to do that.'

The White House's indication that the president could impose a travel ban in the future comes as a cavalcade of lawmakers, mostly Republican, but also some Democrats, have demanded that Obama reconsider his position on the issue.

Republican members of the Texas delegation joined the fray on Thursday, sending a letter to Obama that urged him to use his authority to block individuals from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea from coming to the U.S. 

Also on Thursday, Republican Rep. Dennis Ross of Florida announced that when Congress resumes its legislative session after the midterm elections, he will introduce legislation demanding Obama put a ban into effect.

'Now that two of our healthcare workers have contracted the virus I am putting my foot down,' Ross said.

'This legislation is a more serious approach to preventing Ebola from further infiltrating our homeland.'

Even former White House flak Jay Carney said on Thursday that the president and his administration ought to take it under review.

'I think substantive actions need to be taken, and they may involve flight restrictions, they may involve moving all patients to specific hospitals in the country that can handle Ebola, and I think those would be wise decisions to make,' Carney, now a CNN contributor, said on the network yesterday.

Carney admitted that he's not 'an expert' on the issue but said a more aggressive approach 'would demonstrate a level of seriousness in response to this that is merited at this point.'

Earnest responded in depth to proponents of travel restrictions in his daily briefing on Thursday.

‘If we were to put in place a travel ban or a visa ban, it would provide a direct incentive for individuals seeking to travel to the United States to go underground and to seek to evade this screening and to not be candid about their travel history in order to enter the country,' he claimed.

 'And that means it would be much harder for us keep tabs on these individuals and make sure that they get the screening that's needed to protect them and to protect more importantly the American public,’ he added.

Earnest also said that allowing commercial travel to West Africa is critical' to making sure supplies, equipment and personnel are able to enter the region.

As a 'practical matter' a travel ban would make it 'harder for the international community to respond to this incident,' he said, because airline companies don't make flights into Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea if they can't take any cargo back. 

The White House spokesman confirmed that President Obama made calls to members of Congress on Thursday to talk about the Ebola crisis, including House Speaker John Boehner, who has endorsed the travel ban. He would not say whether Obama and any of the members discussed a travel ban, though.

Rep. Tim Murphy, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, endorsed a travel ban at a rare recess hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday. Murphy charged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure'

White House spokesman Josh Earnest was blitzed with questions about the Obama administration's handling of the Ebola crisis for the second day in a row on Friday. The Obama administration official said again today that the president would not put restrictions on commercial travel from West Africa to the U.S., however he left the possibility open for a future travel ban

At a  congressional hearing on the Ebola crisis in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, members ginned up their support for travel restrictions.

At the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing.Ohio Rep. Tim Murphy alleged that 'screening and self-reporting at airports have been a demonstrated failure.' 

Murphy, who chair's the committee, estimated that approximately 1,000 people from Ebola afflicted countries are arriving in the U.S. on a weekly basis, which presents a great threat. 

At the hearing CDC Director Thomas Frieden declined to say whether his agency had talked about a travel ban with the White House. However, he too, suggested that he would be open to the idea. 

The CDC does not have the authority to restrict flights or visas, however, explained.

'At CDC, our authority is to quarantine individuals or require the isolation of individuals.' 

Congressman Fred Upton of Michigan said he didn't but the White House's claims that travel restrictions would make it too hard to send equipment and personnel to West Africa.

'Surely we can find other ways to get the aid workers and supplies in to these countries,' he said. 'From terrorist watch lists to quarantines, there are tools used to manage air travel to assure public safety. Why not here?  

Upton argued that the Obama administration needs to rethink it's approach to fighting Ebola 'to stop the spread of this disease here at home and at its source in Africa.'

'This includes travel restrictions from that region beginning today.' 

The White House announced on Friday morning that Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to two vice presidents, had been tapped to lead the administration's response to the Ebola crisis.

Earnest said this afternoon that he did not know when Klain would start and that he had only just accepted the job when his appointment was announced to the press.

That number includes members who want an outright travel ban and those who want the U.S. to temporarily rescind West Africans' visas

President Obama said today that he has no 'philosophical objection' to a travel ban - but that he doesn't think it would be effective 

@highlight

The White House says a travel ban would lead to West Africans to find other ways to enter the country, potentially leading to more cases of Ebola

Obama's spokesman said today that the president is willing to 'keep an open mind,' though, and that option 'will continue to be on the table'
