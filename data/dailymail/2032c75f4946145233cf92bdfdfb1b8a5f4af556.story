This is the shocking moment an angry mob stripped, strung up and slowly beat a man to death who was accused of raping and murdering an 11-year-old girl.

Video footage has emerged of the brutal prolonged attack on the 18-year-old, which was watched by a jeering 1,000-strong crowd.

It took place in the same Indian state an alleged rapist was kidnapped from jail and murdered earlier this month. Neither men, who were publicly killed in Nagaland in eastern India, had been convicted of any crimes.

Accused: Ibo Cha allegedly murdered and raped an 11-year-old girl but the police said he had not been arrested

The video footage was shot in September but has only come to light following the kidnapping and murder of alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan in Dimapur

Ibo Cha was dragged into the centre Meluri village, stripped, strung up with rope and beaten for an hour before dying of his injuries.

Men took turns attacking him and a 'ring-leader' appears to stop them form killing him too quickly.

Inspector General of Nagaland, Wabang Jamir said Mr Cha had not been arrested and the villagers took the law into their own hands before the police became involved.

He said: 'The police was not informed about the rape and murder of the young girl. Unfortunately there was no report lodged and we only learnt about the case after the beating of this man incident.

'Three First Information Reports have been registered for the murder of the alleged rapist but the investigation is still ongoing.

'No one has been apprehended in the case so far but we are hopeful that we will soon make arrests.'

The body of the 11-year-old was found in a forest about a kilometre away from Meluri village in September and soon tension mounted in the area.

Eventually, crowds gathered to find the murderer and rapist. But when Ibo Cha – who was also the victim's neighbour – fled, he became their prime suspect.

Groups formed determined to find him and locals located him outside Meluri, before attacking him in the village centre.

He eventually died from his injuries and his body was abandoned before the police stepped in.

The footage was shot in September, but has only come to light following the kidnapping and murder of alleged rapist Syed Sarif Khan in Dimapur. 

A mob tore open the gates of Central Jail in Dimapur and dragged Mr Khan naked through the streets before beating him to death.

Lynched: The gang overpowered security at the Central Jail in the city of Dimapur and grabbed the man before beating him to death. It is unclear whether he is dead in this shocking image

Shocking: The man allegedly raped a student from a local women's college multiple times in February and he was arrested a day later

Accused: The alleged rapist has been identified as a 35-year-old used car trader, according to The Indian Express

He was accused but not convicted of raping a 19-year-old female student multiple times. This week Nagaland Government said he was innocent.

It submitted a report stating the man was falsely accused of rape and it was in fact 'consensual sex', but the investigation is still ongoing following the arrest of 42 locals involved in the beating.

A 25-year-old, believed to be part of the mob, was injured and later died in hospital and four others were hurt when police opened fire.

Earlier this month, police in India were also investigating another attack in the northern city of Varanasi.

A man was killed in a mob attack in Varanasi after a group of girls alleged they were molested while celebrating the Hindu festival of Holi on Friday, police said.
