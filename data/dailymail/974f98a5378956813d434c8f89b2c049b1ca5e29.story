There are eight bedrooms over the two floors of the penthouse

The 14,800 square foot penthouse offers eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms and two kitchens for all the owner's dietary needs and concerns - all with stunning 360 degree views.

There is a private rooftop pool for stunning nighttime sips and a private oceanfront cabana for when only a salt water swim will do.

Then there is the private gym, laundry room, office and, of course, a maid's quarters.

Guests are never a problem either, as the condo comes with five parking spots.

And, perhaps best of all, right on top of the roof sits the iconic blue diamond that shines bright over Miami Beach.

'The Blue Diamond penthouse is a unique opportunity to purchase the largest penthouse on the market in Miami Beach, and one of the largest in all of South Florida,' says listing agent William P.D. Pierce of Coldwell Banker.

The property has not one, but two kitchens, both of which are kosher
