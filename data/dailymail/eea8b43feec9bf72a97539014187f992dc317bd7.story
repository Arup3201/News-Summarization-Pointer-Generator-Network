Thousands of lives could be saved by a £10 blood test that can tell in 30 minutes whether someone has had a heart attack.

Current tests can take six hours or more, during which patients may have another attack or suffer further cardiac damage that could be fatal.

The test has been successfully used in a trial at Manchester Royal Infirmary and could now be rolled out across the health service.

Doctors say the new method – known as the H-FABP test – will quickly pinpoint heart attacks, reducing the need for extensive hospital screening and saving time and money.

If patients have one heart attack, however minor, they are far more likely to suffer a serious one in the near future. Detecting such initial attacks is vital so that sufferers can have appropriate treatment.

For example, a stent, or small tube, can be implanted to help support weak arteries.

The £10 test searches for a protein called H-FABP, or heart-type fatty acid-binding protein, which is released into the blood in a heart attack.

It has been developed by a team at Randox Health in Crumlin, Northern Ireland.

When patients visit A&E with chest pains, doctors often recommend tests to rule out a heart attack. This is the single most common reason for hospital admission – yet in most cases, the pains are down to some other cause.

At the moment, suspected heart attack patients have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test, which can take more than ten times longer than the H-FABP test

At the moment, suspected heart attack patients have an electrocardiogram (ECG) and a blood test, which can take more than ten times longer than the H-FABP test. An ECG costs £60 to £250, but can not detect minor attacks. Experts say many patients are wrongly sent home as a result.

Dr Rick Body, a consultant in emergency medicine at Manchester Royal Infirmary, said the new test ‘offers the potential to rule out heart attack in many patients as early as their time of presentation to hospital’.

‘This means doctors have a more accurate insight into who is at risk,’ he added.

‘Many patients with chest pain are admitted to hospital for hours or even days although most of them don’t have a heart problem and don’t need to stay. These patients could be reassured much earlier if we had better tests.’

Gary Smyth, the medical director of Randox Health, said existing tests are not sensitive enough. The NHS says coronary heart disease, which leads to heart attacks, is the biggest cause of death in Britain and worldwide.

It occurs when blood supply to the heart is blocked by a build-up of fatty substances.

Smoking, high cholesterol, diabetes and high blood pressure all contribute to the condition, which causes 74,000 deaths in the UK each year.

Around one in five men and one in eight women will die from the disease. Men are significantly more at risk than women up to the age of 50.
