Arsenal star Theo Walcott appeared to contradict his manager Arsene Wenger on Thursday by denying he had started talks over a new contract at the club.

Wenger earlier this month said that Arsenal had 'started early' in trying to persuade the forward to sign a new deal.

But, moving to deny reports of a bust-up between himself and Wenger, Walcott only served to further muddy the waters by contradicting his boss.

He tweeted: 'I don't normally comment on false stories about myself but reports about contract demands & bust-ups with the boss are complete nonsense.

'There have been no contract talks as yet and my current focus is not on contracts but on doing my best for Arsenal FC.'

Yet, on March 14, Wenger said: 'The first contacts have been established with the embassy. We will see how that (negotiations) progresses politically.

'Walcott was difficult to convince (in 2013) and that is why it took us much time.

'We have started very early with him, but it was slow progress - he is very quick on the pitch, but off the pitch not always.'

Wenger continued: 'I always wanted to keep him and I still want to keep him now.

Walcott has only recently returned from injury and is struggling to hold down a regular first-team place

'I want him to stay and be a regular player and fight for his place, but no matter where you go if it is a big club you have to compete for your place.'

Walcott has recently returned from a lengthy absence caused by a knee ligament injury sustained in January 2014.

The 26-year-old England international's current deal expires in 2017.
