A hapless driver saw her car written off after she parked it on a beach and it became submerged by the incoming tide.

The female tourist left the Ford Focus on the sand while she went to visit Brean Down fort in Burnham-on-Sea in Somerset.

But while she was gone, the vehicle became engulfed by the incoming tide.

After parking her Ford Focus on Brean beach in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset, a female tourist returned to find it had been engulfed by the incoming high tide

Beach warden Dave Furber tried to search for the owner to warn her that her car was in danger but he was unable to find her before the high tide complete surrounded her vehicle.

He added that the driver, from Devizes in Wiltshire was 'shocked' to come back and find that her car had been deluged.

And now he is warning of the dangers of parking cars on the beach when the tide is approaching.

He said: 'This serves as a warning about heeding warning signs and checking tide times before driving on to the beach.'

So far this year, five other vehicles have also come unstuck in the same area of Burnham-on-Sea.

In May, another Ford Focus became submerged in water after it was left on the beach, while the owner and his family went for a walk on Brean Down.

On the same day, a Ford Mondeo also got stuck in the incoming tide.

In April, a Vauxhall Tigra had to be rescued by the beach warden after the owners parked the car on the beach and then went for a walk.

The incoming tide then complete surrounded the vehicle but luckily the car was driven away before coming completely submerged.

After being almost submerged by the incoming water, the car ended up being written off

Also that month, a family returned to their car, which had been parked on the beach, to find it submerged in water after the tide came in.

And a  month earlier, another car had to be freed by a tractor after it was driven on to mud on the beach and became stuck.

The car, containing the driver, his partner and child had to be pulled free after calling for help from the beach warden.
