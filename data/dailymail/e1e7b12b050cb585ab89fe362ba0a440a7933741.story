Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney was surprisingly the fastest player on the home side during the win over Queens Park Rangers.

Argentina speed merchant Angel di Maria was bought for £60million to add an injection of pace but it was the skipper who clocked the quickest sprint on Sunday.

Rooney reached a top speed of 20.3 miles per hour when attempting to out-sprint former United centre back Rio Ferdinand, who was making his first return to Old Trafford since leaving the club in the summer.

The 28-year-old netted one of United's goals as they comfortably saw off Harry Redknapp's men 4-0 at Old Trafford.

British record signing Di Maria, who cost £60m from Real Madrid, was a close second (20.1mph), followed by Antonio Valencia (20.0mph) and Jonny Evans, who finds himself joint third-fastest.

Falcao's quickest sprint was just 17.9mph during his 23 minutes on the pitch, while Daley Blind (18.9mph) and Herrera (18.3mph) were ninth and tenth fastest respectively.

The final summer signing on display, Marcos Rojo, slotted in nicely at the back for United - reaching a top speed of 19.1mph.

Interestingly, however, Herrera and Blind covered the most ground for United on Sunday - highlighting how important they can be to Van Gaal's side.

Blind enjoyed a stellar performance, running a total of 7.4 miles (11,854.8 metres), yet Herrera covered even more ground.

The Spaniard, signed for £29m from Athletic Bilbao, ran an astonishing 7.6 miles (12,163.1m) - more than 10 per cent of the whole team's distance covered of 72.3 miles.

Rojo (7.1 miles) and Rooney (6.9 miles) also worked extremely hard for Van Gaal, with Tyler Blackett and Evans (6.5 miles each) covering the least distance of the men who played 90 minutes, highlighting just how little they were forced to do defensively by the visiting side.
