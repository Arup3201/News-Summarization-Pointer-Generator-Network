The two Burmese men accused of murdering two British holidaymakers on the holiday island of Koh Tao appeared in court for the first time yesterday.

Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun, both 21, are charged with three offences - conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to rape and robbery - in connection with the deaths of David Miller, 24, and 23-year-old Hannah Witheridge.

A plea to postpone the start of the pre-trial hearings was rejected after defence lawyers wanted a delay to allow more time to prepare, according to the BBC.

It comes after a Thai diplomat was summoned to the Foreign Office amid concerns about the widely-criticised police investigation into the murders.

Mark Kent, the British ambassador to Thailand, said on Twitter he had taken part in a three-hour meeting with Thai police, the Burmese ambassador and a 'delegation' on the Koh Tao murders.

Foreign Minister Hugo Swire told Thai charge d'affaires Nadhavathna Krishnamra there was 'a real concern' in the UK over the way in which the deaths of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller have been dealt with.

Zaw and Win, both migrant workers employed in bars on Koh Tao, were paraded in front of the cameras and forced to take part in a reconstruction of the killings after apparently making confessions.

But those confessions were then apparently retracted, with a statement from a Burmese embassy lawyer claiming the suspects claimed police tortured them into incriminating themselves.

Thai police denied the claims, but Amnesty International has demanded an investigation into them and further allegations of abuse made by members of the Burmese migrant worker community on Koh Tao.

There are widespread rumours on social media that the real perpetrators are Thai mafia who are being protected by police.

Despite the allegations, and further allegations that DNA evidence had been tampered with, Thailand's military junta rejected an offer from Britain to help with the investigation.

The Foreign Office said UK police 'stood ready to assist with the investigation' into the deaths following widespread criticism of the handling of the case in Thailand.

But Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha attempted to downplay growing international concern today and insisted the UK no longer had 'any more doubts' about the investigation.

According to the Bangkok Post, Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters: 'Anyone can come to Thailand, but don't forget that what is our business should remain ours. I consider the Koh Tao case to be reliable.'

Gen Prayuth also denied that Thai diplomat, Nadhavathna Krishnamra, had been 'summoned' by the Foreign Office in London, saying yesterday's meeting was simply to provide 'clarification'.

'They do not have any more doubts about the investigation,' he told the Bangkok Post.

'They simply needed more time to understand it all because we managed to arrest suspects swiftly, even though it seemed impossible at the beginning.'

Mr Swire said it was crucial for the Thai authorities to investigate the killings in a 'fair and transparent way' and keep the victims' families up to date with progress.

Following Mr Krishnamra's meeting with Mr Swire, the Foreign Office said in a statement: 'Mr Swire stressed that there was a real concern in the UK about how the investigation has been handled by the Thai authorities. He said that it was crucial for the investigation to be conducted in a fair and transparent way.

'Mr Swire emphasised how important it was that the UK and Hannah and David's families received regular updates on the investigation's progress.

'He also noted his concern about the way that the police had engaged with the media on the case and reiterated that the UK police stood ready to assist with the investigation and subsequent legal process.'

Mr Miller, from Jersey, died from drowning and a blow to the head, while Miss Witheridge, from Great Yarmouth, died from head wounds.
