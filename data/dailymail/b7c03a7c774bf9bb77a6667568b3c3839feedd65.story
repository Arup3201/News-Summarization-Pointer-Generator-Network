His performance as celebrated  film director Alfred Hitchcock has already been tipped for Oscar glory.

But, as these pictures show, Sir Anthony Hopkins relied on more than just his acting to complete the transformation.

The Welsh actor, who turns 75 tomorrow, spent at least 90 minutes each morning being turned into the director – dubbed the Master of  Suspense by fans – with the aid of two make-up artists, £50,000 of prosthetics and a ‘fat suit’ to replicate Hitchcock’s 21-stone frame.

Guess who: Sir Anthony after the process has been completed. Award-winning makeup artist Howard Berger said: 'It was vitally important that Tony had to be convincing as Hitchcock'

Award-winning make-up artist Howard Berger said of the £50 million film, which also stars Dame Helen Mirren as Hitchcock’s wife Alma: ‘It was vitally important that Tony had to be convincing as Hitchcock. We had what we called a “horseshoe” piece – a flesh-coloured prosthetic which added flesh to the nose, cheeks and chin.

‘It is a lengthy process because you glue the piece on and then you have to carefully “paint” on the flesh tones to make it match. We also had to bulk him up while still making him utterly believable.’

Despite the ordeal, Sir Anthony was ‘a delight’ to work with. ‘Tony was great because he would come  in every morning totally prepared,’ Mr Berger said.

‘He would shave his head and his face. The make-up would go on and his transformation would be complete.

‘His voice, tone and manner of walking would change. It was a sprinkle of magic.

‘Tony would not leave the trailer until he was 100 per cent. He didn’t want to walk on to the set and be Anthony Hopkins.

‘The greatest compliment that Tony paid to me was that he looked at his reflection on that first day  and said, “I don’t think I even need to act, this just does it for me.” ’

The film, due to be released in February, focuses on the British-born director’s strained marriage at the time of his 1960 hit Psycho. 

Featuring Scarlett Johansson as Psycho star Janet Leigh and James D’Arcy as the movie’s leading man Anthony Perkins, it has already opened in the US to rave reviews.
