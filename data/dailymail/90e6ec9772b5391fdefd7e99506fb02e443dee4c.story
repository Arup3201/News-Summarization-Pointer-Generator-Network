Controversial: Multi-millionaire financier Marc Rich has died in Switzerland at the age of 78

Billionaire trader Marc Rich, who was controversially pardoned by Bill Clinton on the President's last day in the White House, died in Switzerland today at the age of 78.

He made his fortune by founding the company which would become Glencore, the world's largest commodities trader, but was more famous for fleeing from the U.S. in 1983 when he was indicted on more than 50 counts of fraud, racketeering and tax evasion.

The charges could have earned Rich 300 years in prison - however, in 2001 Clinton decided to pardon him hours before leaving office, leading to speculation he was motivated by receiving thousands of dollars in donations from the financier's ex-wife Denise.

Rich spent nearly two decades on the FBI's Most Wanted list, and narrowly escaped capture in Finland, Germany, Britain and Jamaica.

Among the most serious crimes of which he was accused was trading with Iran during the U.S. Embassy hostage crisis, when he was alleged to have taken advantage of the oil embargo to make huge profits in the energy market.

He had previously insisted that he was neutral on all matters of international relations, saying: 'In our business we're not political. That's just the philosophy of our company.'

Switzerland refused to hand Rich over to U.S. authorities because of its secretive tax laws and neutral policy towards Iran, and his lawyers repeatedly pressed the Department of Justice to drop the case against him.

When DoJ officials refused to negotiate, Rich's attorneys turned to Clinton, and on January 20, 2001 he granted the fugitive a pardon - just hours before he handed over the White House to George W. Bush.

Critics pointed out that Denise Rich had donated $200,000 to the Democratic Party in the previous year, as well as giving money for Clinton's presidential library.

However, a federal investigation did not find evidence of wrongdoing, and the outgoing President insisted that he had taken advice from independent legal experts.

Rich was born in Antwerp, Belgium, on December 18, 1934. His Jewish family fled from the Nazis to the United States, where Rich went to school and college in New York.

After dropping out of college, Rich went to work for the commodity traders Phillips Brothers, now called Phibro, in New York. He quickly got the knack of trading and in 1967 was sent by the company to work in Madrid, where he met Pincus 'Pinky' Green, his future partner.

In 1973, Rich and Green left the company after arguing over the size of their bonuses. They set up Marc Rich and Co., based in the Swiss town of Zug, whose low taxes have made it one of the world's oil trading centres.

Business boomed, and Rich specialised in acting as a middle man for purchases in global trouble spots - such as Iran, apartheid-era South Africa or Cuba and Libya during U.S. trade embargoes.

Rich and Green were the first traders to use short-term purchases, now known as the spot market, to make big money quickly. Buying large volumes when the price was low, they were able to control the market when prices rose.

In 1983, Rich fled to Switzerland to 
escape charges against him. In his absence, Rich's companies pleaded 
guilty to the charges, paying fines of about $130 million.

'The
question is, was there crime, and I'm saying I don't think so,' Rich 
told NBC in 1992, adding that as Marc Rich and Co. was a Swiss company, it was 
legal for the firm to do business with Ayatollah Khomeini's 
Iran.

Rich worked on making himself popular
by becoming a major philanthropist, giving money to the arts and 
charities in the hope of building good contacts and guarding against 
extradition. He renounced his U.S. citizenship and became a citizen both
of Israel and Spain.

But he earned the hatred of U.S. labour unions during the 1990-92 Ravenswood Aluminum strike in West Virginia.

His
company was a part-owner of Ravenswood, whose workers accused Rich of 
locking 1,500 steelworkers out of the plant when their contract expired 
and hiring replacement workers without negotiating.

Rich had married the former Denise Eisenberg, a New York socialite, in 1966. They divorced in 1992. After that she contributed US$450,000 to Clinton's presidential library foundation and more than US$100,000 to Hillary Clinton's Senate campaign.

In 1993, Rich sold his own company - which was then renamed Glencore and recently merged with rival Xstrata - and set up a new firm, Marc Rich and Co. Holding, also based in Zug.

Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of Glencore Xstrata, said in a statement: 'We are saddened to hear of the death of Marc. He was a friend and one of the great pioneers of the commodities trading industry, founding the company that became Glencore.'

After spending several years in Zug, Rich moved to 'La Villa Rose' on the shores of Lake Lucerne in nearby Meggen. He also owned property in the ski resort of St Moritz and in Marbella.

Rich married again, to German-born Gisela Rossi, in 1998. They divorced in 2005. Rich had two daughters, Ilona Rich Schachter and Danielle Rich Kilstock.

His funeral will take place in Israel tomorrow.
