It is the moment every young police cadet dreams of - finally being told they've withstood the test and trials to become an officer.

Hundreds of young recruits today lined up in their finery at Bogota police headquarters in Colombia to be officially welcomed into the force.

But the heavy uniform, hat and gloves combined with the balmy 19C heat was all a bit too much for one recruit.

The woman, dressed in the traditional grey blazer, white skirt with matching gloves, ceremonial hat and staff, collapsed to the ground in the middle of the ceremony.

Unfortunately for the recruit, the whole episode was caught on national television as the Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos attended the event to watch the passing out parade of the new police recruits in Colombia's biggest city.

The police recruit didn't seem seriously injured by her fall and was helped up by a fellow officer.

Heat fainting generally occurs when a human body reaches a temperature above 40C causing less blood flow to the brain.

It's not the first time young officers have struggled to keep their cool while standing to attention in a formal parade during blistering heat.

Several newly trained Met Police officers fainted during their passing out parade as temperatures soared to 21C in June this year.Â
