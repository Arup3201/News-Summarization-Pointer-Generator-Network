As the Bali Nine pair on death row come to terms with their imminent execution, the Indonesian justice system is being accused of hypocrisy after a local ice manufacturer avoided the death penalty.

While Australians Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan are facing the death penalty for attempting to smuggle drugs into Australia from Bali, local kingpin Hangky Gunawan has been given only a jail sentence for a similar crime. 

Despite hundreds of pleas for clemency for Sukumaran and Chan, Indonesian president Joko Widodo maintains that his hard-line stance against drug dealers will not budge.

But the story of Hangky Gunawan, an Indonesian ice manufacturer who was convicted in 2007 and was handed the death penalty before his appeal - which followed directly after the Bali Nine duos' - won him both a reduced sentence and most importantly, his life, Fairfax reports.

This is despite Gunwan, who owned the drug-producing business based in Surabaya, East Java, and organised ice's distribution, was caught by police with over 11kg of the drug.

When Chan and Sukumaran lodged their final appeal to the Supreme Court in Jakarta in 2011, numbered case 37 and 38, Gunwan's appeal for life was directly after theirs, numbered 39.

But while the Australians' judicial review were rejected, in Gunwan's it was decided that the death penalty violated both the Indonesian constitution, the country's human rights and quoted the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, according to Fairfax.

His prison sentence was subsequently reduced to 12 years and Gunwan was saved from execution.

The result presents a stark contrast to the trials endured by Chan and Sukumaran who are expected to be moved to Nusa Kambangan - a prison island off central Java - where prisoners on death row are executed.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has also called out Indonesia's justice system for its hypocrisy after Mr Widodo offered 'optimum protection' for over 200 of his citizens who face death sentences overseas - some of them being drug smugglers.

'I should also just observe today that millions of Australians are feeling very, very upset about what may soon happen to two Australians in Indonesia,' Mr Abbott said.

'My plea even at this late stage is for Indonesia to be as responsive to us as it expects other countries to be to them when they plead for the lives of their citizens on death row overseas.'

Australia has not decided how it would respond to the executions, including whether to withdraw its ambassador, but Mr Abbott told The Daily Telegraph newspaper: 'We will find ways of making our displeasure known.'

Indonesia's Foreign Ministry has confirmed it has invited all embassies with citizens to be executed this month to a meeting on the formalities on Monday.

A date for the executions won't be provided at the meeting, but the provision of 72 hours notice will be discussed, as well as access to the prisoners for family and logistics over foreign media coverage.

Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir says officials representing Ghana, France, the Philippines and Nigeria have also been summoned.

When Indonesia executed five foreign nationals last month, the meeting with relevant embassies took place one day before Attorney-General HM Prasetyo announced the execution date.

That announcement signalled the 72-hour notice period.

But in this case, the prisoners have to be transferred from jails all over Indonesia to the execution location, Nusakambangan island, off Central Java.

Both men have vowed that their time in jail has rehabilitated them and they deserve a reprieve

Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on Friday suggested the depth of feeling in Australia is so strong that Australians may boycott Indonesia if the executions go ahead, but she denied that she was urging for a boycott.

'I knew that there was very deep concern in the Australian public about the likely executions of Mr Sukumaran and Mr Chan, and that Australians will make their own decisions as to whether they want to travel to a country that does have the death penalty,' Ms Bishop told Macquarie Radio on Saturday.

Boycott calls were growing on social media before Ms Bishop's remarks and politicians have received a flood of letters about the executions.

Ms Bishop's opposition counterpart Tanya Plibersek told the Seven Network she didn't think this was helpful.

'I'm really not sure that boycotting Bali is going to make much of a difference to the attitude in Jakarta,' Ms Plibersek said.

Chan and Sukumaran have been disturbed by the evident preparation for their execution as prison guards broke open the lock to their jail cells to conduct a search.

Artist Ben Quilty says Sukumaran is no longer sleeping as he waits with dread for a final knock on his door to take him to his execution by firing squad.

Quilty said goodbye the 33-year-old to at Kerobokan prison in Bali for the last time on Thursday.

'He knows someone will knock on his door in the middle of the night. I offered to bring him valium but he said 'no'. He is completely free from drugs and won't even take sleeping pills,' Quilty told ABC radio.

The Australian artist, who in 2011 won the Archibald Prize, has been Sukumaran's mentor since 2012, helping him develop a talent for painting. 

Australia's efforts to stop the executions have so far failed, along with desperate legal bids.

Their Sydney families are in Bali, where they have spent the past three weeks paying daily visits to the men in Kerobokan jail.

Over the past decade they've been imprisoned there, Chan and Sukumaran have transformed into model inmates, who have helped scores of others rehabilitate and get drug-free.
