Tottenham are far too good to go down. Right?

Of course they are. While this Spurs squad isn't equipped to challenge for a top-four place, there's no way in hell they'll be involved in a relegation battle at the end of the season.

But that's what we said about Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest in 1993, West Ham in 2003, Leeds United 12 months later. They were all too good to go down.

Tottenham have lost five of their opening 11 Premier League games under Mauricio Pochettino this season

Mauricio Pochettino's start at White Hart Lane has been chequered to say the least. His side's form in the Europa League and Capital One Cup has been good.

But it's their Premier League form that'll be concerning the Argentine. Five defeats from their opening 11 games has left them with an uphill struggle to even be in contention for a Champions League position.

On 14 points, they are closer to rock-bottom Burnley than league leaders Chelsea.

Losing Gareth Bale at the start of last season was always going to be a huge blow for Pochettino

With some of the talent at Pochettino's disposal, that statistic is unforgivable.

Losing Gareth Bale at the start of last season was always going to be a huge loss. Take a player of Bale's quality out of any side, you'll notice the difference.

Just ask Brendan Rodgers about what impact Luis Suarez's departure at Liverpool has had on his side this season.

Bale was replaced by a raft of new signings in 2013; players which we were led to believe would make Spurs a better all-round outfit - even without their superstar Welshman.

Harry Redknapp guided Spurs to fourth place in the final Premier League standings back in 2012 

It turns out that Spurs signed a raft of duds. Andre Villas-Boas that found out to his detriment last season, Pochettino is finding out now.

Roberto Soldado arrived from Valencia with a hugely impressive goal record. The less said about him said the better.

Paulinho came with the reputation of being one of the best central midfielders in South American football when he arrived from Corinthians. He hasn't started a single league game this season.

Erik Lamela did, of course, score that sublime Rabona goal against Brighton earlier this season, but he's hardly proved a worthwhile £30million deal.

Christian Eriksen has shown some value for money, but only in patches.

What has happened to all these players? Has all that talent just vanished into the north London atmosphere?

Spurs are in the midst of an alarming slide down to mid-table obscurity. If things continue, that scenario could get even worse.

Spurs chairman Daniel Levy will be expecting Pochettino to turn Spurs's fortunes around quickly 

Will they get relegated? No chance. But the fact we are even discussing the prospect is a sad indictment of how far their fortunes have fallen in the past two-and-a-half years.

A team that finished fourth under Harry Redknapp in 2012 has gone backwards.

It begs the question of why Redknapp was ever relieved of his duties later that summer. That's an altogether different topic, though.

The only topic that concerns Spurs fans at the moment is how they can wrestle themselves out of their current malaise.

Giving Pochettino funds to sign the two strikers he wants in January will be a start.

To judge Pochettino at this early stage of his tenure would be unfair. This is not his Spurs team.

But as history tells, Spurs chairman Daniel Levy isn't one for excuses.
