It is home to Polish delis, Irish pubs, Arab sweet shops, Pakistani markets, Jamaican hairdressers - and much more besides.

Data from the most recent Census shows that Cheetham Hill Road in north Manchester is one of Britain's most diverse streets.

Nearly half, an incredible 48 per cent, of all residents in the district, which has historically been home to migrants from accros the globe, revealed that English was not their main language.

However, dozens of people of all races and religions said that there was no other place they would rather call home.

'It's a good place to be,' said unemployed 53-year-old Mark Wright.

'You can see the 
whole world here. Everyone just gets on with each other. It doesn't 
matter who you are or your faith or your language.'

Across Manchester, 17per cent of adults told Census researchers that they did not speak English as their first language.

Although
 Cheetham was originally a town in its own right, its garment districts,
 cheap rents and links with the cotton industry have made it the go-to 
place for generations of Jewish, Irish and south Asian migrants.

According to the Office of National 
Statistics, Urdu is the most commonly spoken language after English, 
followed by Arabic, Polish, Kurdish and Italian.

The high street - with its explosion 
of varied shop fronts - is testament to the waves of international 
influences over the last century.

Market trader, 27-year-old Arfaq Malik said: 'I have lived here all my life.Â 

'What's 
changed is the Eastern European people coming to the area - but I think 
it is a more interesting place to live.

'I have gone to the Polish shops 
and tried the sweets they have and we get Jewish and Polish people 
coming for their vegetables and fruit.'

James Monaghan, aged 51 years, said that he had embraced the different cultures since moving into the area.

'I have lived here for more than 25 
years," said unemployed Mr Monagham.

'It's changed a lot but it's still a great place to live. There's 
lots of Jewish, Polish and quite a few Afghan people.

'I used to go on 
pub crawls but now I go on curry crawls.'

Full-tim mum Esther Blair-Jackson said: 'I think it's good that it's 
busy during the day and there are a lot of shops now. It's good that 
people get on.'

Rasa Guobine is a relative newcomer to the area, but the 46-year-old care assistant said that she enjoyed living there and meeting her neighbours.

'I have been 
living here for eight months. People are very nice.

'One of the women I 
know has lived 60 years in Cheetham Hill. She told me that the street 
used to be nicer with nice shops.

'But I think people are very friendly 
here.'

Retired travel agent Qauuym Malik, aged 68 years, said: 'There has never been any 
trouble.

'People respect each others' differences.

'I used to live in a 
very Jewish area and people couldn't have been nicer. The main problem 
is that the streets and houses are run down.

'They need regeneration and 
some money putting into them.'

An Orthodox Jewish rabbi, who did not wish to be named, said: 'I have lived here all my life. People have their own circles but they respect each other.

'You have got your kosher shops, your halal butchers and Polish delis.

'But I'm going to the Kashmir Market just now to get some cooking apples. There's no reason not to get on with your neighbours."

Other areas of Greater Manchester where many languages are spoken include Longsight and Levenshulme in Manchester, Bolton's Heaton area and north Chadderton in Oldham.

The findings came as no surprise to Manchester University language professor Yaron Matras, who has identified more than 150 languages being spoken in Manchester.

He said: 'Although Census data provides important confirmation of Manchester's enormous linguistic diversity, our research shows it has significantly under-represented both languages spoken and the numbers of people who speak them.

'We identified that our city boasts at least 153 languages, making it one of the world's most diverse places.

'It is very likely to be top of the list in Europe, certainly when compared to other cities of its size, perhaps only outflanked by London and Paris.'
