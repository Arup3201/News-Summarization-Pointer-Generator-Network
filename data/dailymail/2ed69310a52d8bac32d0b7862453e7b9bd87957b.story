Toronto's crack-smoking Mayor Rob Ford plans to return to work on June 30 after a two-month stay in rehab.

Ford said he will resume his duties as mayor 'in the later portion of the afternoon', in a letter to the city clerk released today. He asked the clerk to restore his old office locks which were changed when he left.

Ford is in rehab for alcohol addiction after announcing in April that he was seeking treatment. He made the decision after another video surfaced that apparently showed him smoking crack.

Ford admitted last year after reports of a similar video that he had smoked crack in a 'drunken stupor,' following months of denials.

Toronto's crack-smoking mayor Rob Ford (pictured in June last year) plans to be back at home at the end of the month when he will launch his reelection campaign

The mayor of Canada's largest city has not abandoned his bid to seek a second term in October.

Earlier this month, Ford released a picture on himself taking a dip in the pool at his rehab clinic. He also announced plans to launch his re-election campaign on July 1 - Canada Day.

Ford
 has been at the Greenestone facility in Ontario since checking himself 
in on May 1 after another drunken rant was caught on camera.

Speaking to the Toronto Sun, he said: 'I will be back, I guarantee you. I am coming back and you will see a different Rob Ford.'

Speaking about his time in the clinic, Ford said he has been able to work out, relax and make some friends, though confessed he was missing his family.

The only time he had seen his wife and children was for a trip to Crabby Joe's on his birthday, and he added that he was anxious to get back to them.

On the subject of his addiction, he acknowledged that it was his own fault.

He said: 'No one has enabled me. We were talking about the enabling thing the other day in a meeting. You do booze or drugs because you want to do it.

'I take full responsibility. I have learned my lesson.'

Ford was pictured looking glum outside the clinic last month, wearing an orange sweater, jeans and Crocs

'I feel good. You are going to see a difference. You are going to see a healthier Rob Ford and I am going to win the election on Oct. 27.'

The picture was the first time Ford had been seen inside the clinic, though last month he was pictured outside wearing
 a bright orange Texas Longhorns sweater, jeans and Crocs.

On that occasion, 44-year-old looked glum during the brisk stroll, despite earlier 
calling the luxurious rehabilitation center 'amazing' and saying it 
reminded him of 'football camp'.

A week before that, he was seen in Bracebridge, which is about 25 miles east of the center. He was seen chatting with local residents, many of whom snapped pictures with him and posted them online.

In a bizarre twist, he also made headlines last month when a former fellow resident at the clinic, 36-year-old LeeAnne Rob, was charged with drink-driving his SUV.

She also suggested that she had left her watch in his room although the has since refused to comment on the nature of their relationship.

He's
 is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking,
 but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' his lawyer Dennis Morris told the National Post.

Speaking to the Toronto Sun at the start of the month, Ford said he feels 'great' and is benefiting from the 
self-imposed exile.

'It
 reminds me of football camp. Kind of like the Washington Redskins camp I
 went to as a kid,' he said, adding 'I am working out every day and I am
 learning about myself, my past and things like that.'

Residence: The clinic has 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' with 'rustic suites', its website says

He
 joked 'on October 28 there will be no need to change the locks. There 
will be no need to clean out my office because I am coming back.'

He said the very public fall from grace - including a video of him smoking crack, being filmed while drunk and making lewd comments about his wife - was what he needed to shake him into action.

'I do feel bad about what happened, but it might have been the best thing that happened because I am working on getting better,' he told the Sun reporter.

He
 said the decision to check himself into rehab came on April 29 - the 
morning after he was taped in an apparent intoxicated state at a city 
pub.

During the rant, he also claimed he was 'in a divorce' and staying at a hotel. He has been married to wife Renata since 2000.

Out and about: Ford, 44, has been spotted in the nearby town of Bracebridge, where he has posed for photographs with fans

Out of control: Ford (pictured in January with Toronto's chief budget officer) found himself in deep water last year when a video emerged of him using crack cocaine. Others emerged of his drunken tirades

The
 same day Ford announced his leave of absence, the Globe and Mail 
published screen grabs of a new video which shows Ford smoking the 
illegal drug at his sister's house on April 26 before apparently checking into GreenStone.

On the centres website, it says: 'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities.'

Its accommodation consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.'

Ford previously indicated to the Toronto Sun that his treatment could cost as much as $100,000.

'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he said. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.'
