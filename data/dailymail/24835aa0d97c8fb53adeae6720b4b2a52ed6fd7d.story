This is the nail-biting moment a plane bounces to a standstill and skids on its nose as it makes an emergency landing.

The small Cessna aircraft ran into trouble as its landing gear malfunctioned in-flight over Texas on Monday afternoon.

After circling in the air for about an hour, the male pilot and female passenger made the decision to crash land it on the tarmac at David Wayne Hooks Airport in Houston close to 5pm.

Video footage shows the plane coming down at a steep angle and bouncing several times on the runway as the nose fails to pull up.

Finally, after a long slide, the carrier comes to a standstill and the passengers immediately get out unscathed.

Emergency services were on hand in case a fire erupted. 

It wasn't immediately clear if medical attention was required but no injuries were reported.
