The bad news for our supermarkets just keeps coming. They have been lining up in recent days to report sales figures ranging from disappointing to near disastrous.

Yesterday, it was Morrisons' turn to feel the pain, when it announced that its sales in the six weeks to January 4 fell by 3.1 per cent. As an indication of just how serious this is for the chain, Morrisons announced 400 job losses and that it will shut ten loss-making stores this year.

It represents a crippling psychological setback for Morrisons, and underlines how only drastic action can halt, or at least slow, the haemorrhage of shoppers from its stores.

Morrisons CEO  Dalton Philips is to step down after five years at the helm of the struggling supermarket business after it announced that its sales in the six weeks to January 4 fell by 3.1 per cent

Morrisons' chief executive, Dalton Philips, the man who set out optimistically only five years ago to refresh the already ailing business with novel strategies such as 'misting' vegetables (spraying them with water so they seem more appealing), has stepped down.

Other big chains dare not gloat, for they aren't much better off. Last week Sainsbury's reported its worst Christmas for more than a decade with like-for-like sales down 1.7 per cent. Now, they're cutting 500 jobs, too.

This came hot on the heels of an unprecedented poor performance from beleaguered Tesco. Already reeling from a succession of profit warnings and the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts, it recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent.

This decline is so significant Tesco has decided to close 43 loss-making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge Tesco Extra superstores. How are the mighty fallen! And how rapidly.

Until September 2013, when Tesco backtracked on its plans to open a store in Sherborne, Dorset, after residents' effective 'No Thanks Tesco' campaign, the brand was synonymous with aggressive expansion and never-ending, seemingly unstoppable store openings.

The Big Four supermarkets have all been struggling with Morrisons, Tesco and Sainsbury's posting dramatic falls in Christmas sales

Tesco, already reeling from  the discovery of a huge and mysterious black hole in its accounts, recently reported a sales drop of 2.9 per cent which has led to a decision by the supermarket to close 43 loss-making stores this year and shelve plans to open 49 huge Tesco Extra superstores

We await results from Asda, but given that Marks & Spencer is reporting its spindly 0.1 per cent food sales increase as 'strongly outperforming the market', it seems unlikely that Asda will have much to raise the prevailing gloom that hangs over the supermarket sector.

So why do things look so bad?

Quite simply, we don't automatically want to shop in big supermarkets any longer.

Sick of being ripped off by their outrageous prices, we're abandoning the knee-jerk, one-stop weekly shopping expedition supposed to get us through the week, but which often left us with half a fridge of uneaten food.

We have become promiscuous customers, shopping around more frequently, buying less at a time, and cherry-picking from various outlets. In these straitened economic times we are intently focused, more suspicious than ever, about what we are being asked to pay for food.

The nation's supermarket shopping habit has been irretrievably broken by the arrival of the German-owned discount chains, Aldi and Lidl. It took them more than 20 years (Aldi arrived in this country in 1990 and Lidl in 1994) to get their cheaper price message through to us, but we've definitely got it now. Loud and clear.

We realise the 'Big Four' have been charging us way too much — behaving particularly rapaciously when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables — earning excessive margins and profiteering at our expense.

Last week, for example, I could have paid £2.99 per kilogram for cherry tomatoes in Sainsbury's, but at Lidl I'd have paid only £1.78. The celery Morrisons wanted 79p for cost 39p at Aldi.

And this isn't the discounters playing silly, short-term games with prices — unlike their higher-profile rivals. It's these discount chains simply showing what can be done with a different business model and less greedy pricing.

Such spectacular price differences couldn't be ignored for ever. Britain's shoppers have finally woken up and voted with their feet, and their wallets.

Given the hundreds of millions the big supermarket chains have spent on building our trust — through advertising, loyalty cards, phony price wars and deliberately bamboozling promotions — the discovery that, surprise, surprise, they're not actually on our side has been shattering, and has changed consumers' habits dramatically.

These chains all kept telling us how cheap they were, and we believed them. What they forgot to tell us was what obscene profits they were making.

'Every little helps,' said Tesco, and we never paused to ask: 'Helps whom?' Well, no more. Any trust we had in them has been lost and may never be restored.

It's not many years since the supermarket each of us so loyally used almost defined who we were — an aspirational Sainsbury's family, perhaps, or maybe down-to-earth Morrisons customers.

It still does, to some extent — in the case of Waitrose. But by and large, the ties that bound us so tightly to one particular chain have been broken.

There is more genuine choice and better value to be had elsewhere. These days, we shop where we want — at Aldi one day, at a local butcher or grocer the next and, on those days when we're simply too tired to care, at whichever chain-owned convenience store we pass on the way home, when we'll decide what's for dinner that night.

Mainstream chains still get some of what we spend on food — but not as much.

Many people will be overjoyed by supermarkets finally getting their comeuppance — their aggressive expansion policies, in the High Street and out of town, made them bitterly resented.

On Twitter, news that Tesco would shut 43 of its smaller stores was celebrated by those delighted that the destroyer of so many local, independent shops was beginning to suffer itself.

Add the cancelled plans for 49 superstores — the white elephants of today's food retail world, according to analysts — and what many saw as the 'Tesco-isation' of Britain finally seems to have gone into reverse.

They have also announced they are cutting 500 jobs to tackle the poor sales as shoppers turn to cheaper alternatives such as budget chains Aldi and Lidl

I'm sure other chains will quietly follow suit, mothballing plans for future store openings. And, as with Tesco and Morrisons, I wouldn't be surprised to see existing stores shut, too.

Britain's supermarkets may have peaked in their hold over us, but they certainly won't vanish altogether, though it would be encouraging to see signs of them learning from past mistakes. Instead, Sainsbury's has done what big chains always do when faced with adversity — announced yet another 'price war' to try to persuade customers they are getting brilliant deals (when often they could still buy cheaper elsewhere), and place even more economic pressure on its suppliers.

So what will the future of food shopping in Britain look like?

Now, the supermarket enchantment spell has been broken, consumers are back in charge. If we want to shop at a discounter we will, a trend that may result in a modest expansion of the Aldi or Lidl chains: their circumspect German owners are too canny and conservative for grandiose plans.

They'll have seen what over-ambition has done to Tesco, and learned a lesson.

Other winners will be the assortment of retailers that have emerged in the past few years to meet the demand from consumers for a better shopping experience. I'm talking about traditional street markets, small independent shops, Asian and Middle Eastern grocers, farmers' markets, vegetable box schemes, farm shops, food co-operatives and a range of online enterprises that have successfully carved out their own niches.

It's not nostalgia for times long past. But some traditional street markets offer better value than even the discount chains.

No, I look at today's food shopping experience and see what works and what doesn't. And what certainly doesn't work as well as it used to is shopping at supermarkets. Our 40-year love affair with them is over. Now, they must pay the price.
