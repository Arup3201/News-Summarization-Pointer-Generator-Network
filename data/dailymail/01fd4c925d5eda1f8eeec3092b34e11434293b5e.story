A Subway restaurant in Chicago has installed a bulletproof glass screen to keep their employees safe, just as the city's police chief insisting the homicide rate has gone down.

The 24-hour sandwich shop, on the city's south side, has put up a glass barrier around the serving area, including a revolving door hatch for staff to pass food through.

The news comes on the same day that police chief Garry McCarthy praised his force for keeping homicides down to their lowest level - 415 last year - since 1965.

A Subway restaurant on Chicago's south side has put up a bulletproof glass screen around the service counter to protect staff in America's 'murder capital'

That figure was an 18 per cent drop on 2012 and he said this year's rate is 'still ahead of where we were last year'.

That is despite a spate of violence over the Easter weekend which left nine people dead and another 36 wounded, including six children aged 11 to 15.

It is not known exactly what prompted the Subway enclosure to be put up, and when contacted by Mail Online, a member of restaurant staff refused to comment.

Speaking to WGN Radio's Steve Cochran, Supt McCarthy said: 'A week doesn't wipe out two years of progress.

'We always knew that we're going to have good days and we're going to have bad days, we've just got to make sure we're having more good days than bad.'

The barrier was put up as Gerry McCarthy, the city's Police Chief, announced that the homicide rate has dropped - despite a spate of violence over the Easter weekend

He praised officers for 'getting out in front of the shootings' but told CNN it would take time for the improvements to be felt.

In the latest round of violence five children were shot in a drive-by on Sunday night after a person in a vehicle reportedly asked if the children were members of a particular street gang, then opened fire.

A sixth youngster, a 15-year-old girl, was shot while riding in a vehicle in what appears to be a separate gang-related incident.

Supt McCarthy highlighted the Easter killings to call for more gun control laws.

'It's just insanity that there's such a proliferation of firearms that they're so easy to get your hands on,' Supt McCarthy told WGN Radio

'The studies show when there's more restrictive gun laws, there's less gun violence. It's not brain surgery, it's really really simple.

'It's going to take us a while to fix poverty and the break-up of the family units and education and jobs. But we can do something about gun laws today and we're just not doing it.'
