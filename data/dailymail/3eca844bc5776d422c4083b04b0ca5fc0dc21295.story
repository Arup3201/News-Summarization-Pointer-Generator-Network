Art work produced by Nelson Mandela showing the views he spent 27 years looking at from his prison cell window have emerged for sale.

The five 'primitive' images depict the lighthouse on Robben Island that he could see, along with a church and the harbour.

He also drew his cell from outside looking in and his cell window complete with metal bars.

Cell with a view: This is the view of Table Mountain looming over Cape Town - the view Nelson Mandela saw every day for 27 years

That's what I saw: He returned to the cell many times after his release, including in 1999 when this picture was taken 

The anti-apartheid campaigner was imprisoned for almost three decades on the small isle off Cape Town, South Africa, for conspiracy to overthrow the state government.

But it wasn't until about 10 years after his release in 1990 that Mandela produced the pictures as a symbol of his struggle.

From the original work, a set of 500 lithograph prints were made and signed by the former South African Prime Minister, who died last year aged 95.

Shining light: The five 'primitive' images depict the lighthouse on Robben Island as well

Valuable: This set of lithograph prints - number 10 out of 500 - is being sold at auction in West Sussex for an estimated £25,000

'My struggle': But it wasn't until about 10 years after his release in 1990 that Mandela produced the pictures as a symbol of his struggle. They include a print of Mandela's writings (left) - in his distinctive hand - upon which he based his sketches

Distinctive: 'Today when I look at Robben Island I see it as a celebration of the struggle and a symbol of the finest qualities of the human spirit, rather than as a monument to the brutal tyranny and oppression of apartheid'

One of those sets - number 10 out of 500 - is now being sold at auction in West Sussex for an estimated £25,000.

Elizabeth Scott, of auctioneers Bellmans of Wisborough Green, said: 'These images are quite primary in terms of the colours. They are quite bold and there aren't too many colour tones going on in them,

'They are what they are.

The Harbour: The five pictures, that measure 23ins by 16ins, are being sold on October 8.

Prison isle: Robben Island lied a few miles off Cape Town, South Africa

'Nelson Mandela did dabble in art and in 2002 he produced this set of five drawings to remember his time in prison. A limited set of 500 were printed.

'Because of who created them, there will be a lot of interest in them.'

As well as the five drawings, Mandela also wrote out his motivation for the art.

Part of it reads: 'Today when I look at Robben Island I see it as a celebration of the struggle and a symbol of the finest qualities of the human spirit, rather than as a monument to the brutal tyranny and oppression of apartheid.

'It is true that Robben Island was once a place of darkness, but out of that darkness has come a wonderful brightness, a light so powerful that it could not be hidden behind prison walls, held back by prison bars or hemmed in by the surrounding areas.'

The five pictures, that measure 23ins by 16ins, are being sold on October 8.
