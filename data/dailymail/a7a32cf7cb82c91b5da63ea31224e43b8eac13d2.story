Back in 1986, a producer friend at the BBC suggested that a book I had written, The English Woman’s Wardrobe, would make a good documentary film. The book was not about fashion, but about women’s feelings about their clothes. Princess Margaret was the star of the printed version: we wanted Mrs Thatcher to take that role in the film.

Amazingly, she agreed. With curiously little difficulty, a visit to 10  Downing Street was arranged. We would be allowed half an hour talking to Mrs Thatcher in her sitting room at the top of the house. It was hoped that I would be able to persuade her to show us a few of her favourite clothes.

Some days before the interview, my producer friend, Ruth Jackson received a command from on high in the BBC. There was a single question they were adamant I should put to the Prime Minister: where did she get her knickers? Not quite able to believe they should require me to do something so impolite, I said I refused to ask that. 

Me and my wardrobe: Margaret Thatcher spoke about her style in an interview with the BBC in 1986

In that case, came the reply, my producer would have to take over the interview. I was outraged. Even as we arrived at Downing Street, I still had not decided what to do. I did not want the interview to be snatched away, but felt the rude question was impossible to ask.

A security man, unsure of the way, led us upstairs, and down, and up, trying to pretend he and his band of followers weren’t lost. Eventually, we reached the top floor. It was flung open by the Prime Minister. She greeted us with extraordinary enthusiasm. It was only later that we heard that, for her, it was the sixth interview of the day.

She led us into the sitting room. There, some 20 different garments were hanging before us on a long clothes rack. She had abandoned her lunch break to heave them from her bedroom into the sitting room.

Never could she have imagined how helpful she had been: now, she and I could saunter along the line, stop at each dress or suit, and I would ask about its history.

In those days, filming on location was made difficult by the short time of each magazine (length of film) in the camera — ten minutes. Towards the end of each magazine a clunking, warning noise could be heard.

What seemed like seconds into the first part of the interview, the juddering sound could be heard, and we’d hardly started. Only 20 minutes to go...

Mrs Thatcher remembered the history of everything on the rack, and described each one with merry recall.

She pointed to a severe beige suit. ‘This we wore on a visit to the Polaris missile,’ she explained, with a touch of nostalgia. The ‘we’ she referred to meant, I think, she and her dressmaker. Most of the clothes were made for her by this lady, and chiefly designed by the Prime Minister herself.

‘I invented this skirt,’ she said, and swished a long evening dress down from the rack. One side of the skirt was slashed to reveal a coloured petticoat beneath it.

‘It’s one of my favourites. I’ve noticed some designers have begun to copy the idea.’

I observed that on the whole she chose dark colours. ‘Yes: that’s what Denis says. He likes a bright colour, so I had this made.’ She held up another dress — this one of dazzling flamingo pink. Clunk, clunk went the camera. Twenty minutes gone now, and no opening for the dreaded knicker question.

She explained that she rarely bought clothes from designers. What she enjoyed, she said, in the name of economy, was finding ‘the end of a roll’ of material.

Dress sense

Mrs Thatcher summed up her style as 'never flashy, just appropriate'

However, she did love Caroline 
Charles clothes. I cheekily pointed out that the jacket I was wearing 
was by Caroline Charles. I had chosen it on purpose: it led to further 
bonding.

I asked her why there were two 
identical dresses. ‘Well, you see, we needed a whole roll of stuff for 
one dress, but there was just enough for a second one, so naturally we 
used that, too. I always like to use up the end of a roll.’

Clunk, clunk went the camera, and we were only half way down the rack. 

Mrs T had done her first interview that morning at 6am. It was completely reasonable of her to afford us half an hour, but two hours had gone by. And still no opening for the knicker question.

I was beginning to panic. But she carried on cheerfully, flicking through some dresses that President Reagan had liked. Then she came to a dull-looking navy blazer. ‘Marks & Spencer’, she said.

The dreaded clunking began. Inspiration suddenly came. ‘Do you get a lot of things from M&S?’

‘Well, they’re very kind. They open a store at eight in the morning for me.’

‘And do you get your underwear there, like everyone else?’

‘Yes.’

End of film, and the BBC had its answer. Underwear was surely less offensive than knickers. Palpable relief. We had spent three hours with the Prime Minister, so happily engrossed that, apparently, she had not noticed the passing of time.

I liked to think it was an agreeable break from politics for her. She began to return the clothes to her bedroom, and made tea for everyone. Her warmth, her exuberance and her enjoyment of an unusual interview were surprising and unforgettable. She was extraordinary.
