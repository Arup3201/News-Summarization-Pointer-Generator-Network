TV personality Joe Hildebrand has landed himself in hot water over a joke he made on Twitter while Ian Thorpe's coming out interview was being aired.

'Good on Thorpey for coming out as gay. Although if he really wanted to shock people he should've said that he was straight. #IanThorpe,' he posted on Sunday night.

Other Twitters users including TV and radio personalities slammed Hildebrand for his comment, calling it 'crude' and 'unkind'.

'If Joe Hildebrand really wanted to shock people he should have failed to act like a nauseating cretin,' Bernard Keane posted.

As the backlash started to mount on Twitter, Hildebrand tried to redeem himself by offering an apology for earlier his Tweet.

'In all seriousness, Ian Thorpe coming out might actually be the biggest breakthrough for gay acceptance Australia has ever seen,' he posted.

More than an hour later the Studio 10 and Triple M presenter and News Corp columnist offered another 'apology': 'I am so sorry that apparently everyone on Twitter didn't know Thorpey was gay. Best wishes to your home planet.'

He then followed this with a tweet about 'groundbreaking' MasterChef news.

After his initial tweet, the TV personality backtracked calling Thorpe's coming out a 'breakthrough'

A series of apologies followed, although people on Twitter found these equally offensive

As the backlash developed, Hildebrand became embroiled in a stoush with Triple J radio weekend breakfast host Kyran Wheatley.

'He JUST said it was this sort of expectation that prevented him from coming out. How f*****g stupid are you?' Wheatley tweeted.

Hildebrand responded with: '@kyranwheatley I refuse to be called "stupid" by anyone called "Kyran".'

SBS TV personality Marc Fennell weighed at this point: '@Joe_Hildebrand @kyranwheatley making fun of someone's name? C'mon mate, you're smarter & better than that.'

About two hours after his original tweet, Hildebrand offered a third apology reiterating his previous attempts to rectify the situation.

Triple J's Kyran Wheatley hit out at Hildebrand's comments, only to be told his name 'stupid'

'APOLOGY: I apologise for my previous apology, which did not apologise enough for saying how good it was that Thorpey came out. #IanThorpe,' he posted.

A fourth apology from Hildebrand at nearly 10pm read: 'APOLOGY: I apologise for my previous apology for my previous apology. I hereby retract that apology. I apologise for the second apology,' he tweeted.

After the interview aired, Thorpe shared a tweet, thanking everyone for their support. 'To Everyone who has sent a message of support I sincerely Thank you!' he wrote.

Channel 10 and Joe Hildebrand have been contacted for comment.
