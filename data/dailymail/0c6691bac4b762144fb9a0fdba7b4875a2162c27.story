Team GB's 'Invisible Man' made a much-anticipated appearance at the Olympic Stadium today - but crashed out in his qualifying round.

Phillips Idowu's fitness and whereabouts had fascinated fans and frustrated coaches since the start of the Games and his early exit will raise questions about his decision to reject Team GB guidance in the build-up.

Today he pulled off his headband in disgust as he walked away from the pit, having finished two places outside the top 12.

The triple jumper had insisted he spent the last few weeks in his home city of London "as planned months ago".

But UK Athletics head coach Charles 
van Commenee said he was perplexed that Idowu had turned his back on UKA
and his own coach Aston Moore, who had only received a brief text 
before Idowu cut off contact.

The Beijing silver medallist struggled to make an impact, failing to qualify as he slipped to 14th place.

Despite strong support from the home crowd, he looked out of sorts on all three of his jumps.

Needing 17.10m to qualify automatically, Idowu could only manage a best of 16.53m from his three attempts

He appeared annoyed at his 16.47m first jump - short of the 17.10m needed to qualify automatically for Thursday's final.

His second ended in a no jump and he managed only a marginal improvement on his third jump, measuring 16.53m.

The 33-year-old world champion has 
competed just three times in 2012 but, if fit and on form, had been seen
as a gold medal contender.

He missed out on gold in Beijing by 5cm.

Idowu spoke afterwards on the uncertainty about his preparation: 'I had been traveling from Birmingham to London to see my coach. After withdrawing from Crystal Palace I was back up in Birmingham and had a problem in my hip going down to my knee.

'I started a couple of training sessions in Birmingham and had to pull up in a running session. I made the decision to come back down to London and with the work over that week was better to stay in the UK. Warming up and training I had to make sue someone was there to work with me.

'I had some great sprint and technical sessions but a full approach is a different kettle of fish. The timing wasn't there. The hop and step was there but I just couldn't get my final phase.'

He added: 'To be honest I have been lucky over the last four or five years and have competed at my best at the championships and being able to do that I've been able to come away with at least silver.

'I'm not at my best and I was hoping I would still produce something but it wasn't to be.

'I felt ok. I managed to get out and see my physio before today's competition so went in pain free and I felt that I could have possibly qualified automatically.

'I knew I would be rusty because it's been a while, conditions were difficult because of the wind and I knew that would be a factor but that wasn't me out there today. I've competed for 12 years and I can't remember a time I've performed that badly.'

Idowu was cheered loudly by a capacity 80,000 crowd at the Olympic Stadium as he took part in the triple jump

But the pain in his expression betrayed intense disappointment at his efforts

Talking about his injury problems, Idowu said: 'I'm guessing I will need surgery at the end of this season. I'll call it a day and wrap up the season. I wanted to battle for gold but now I'll go home and reassess and go home and try not to be down about my performance.

'It's over and there's nothing I can do. The crowd have been great I'm upset that I let them down. All year I've been tagged as a medal favourite and I haven't got the chance to go out there and do it.

'I'm not sure what. I had a problem with my right leg and I can't say specifically.'

He also issued a parting shot, saying he receives no funding from UK Athletics: 'I am not lottery funded. I have not been lottery funded for at least three years. I pay for my own medical, I pay for my own physio and I will pay for my own surgery.

'There is no association between me and UKAA, if you can find a form that I have signed that says I received money from UKAA then hold me accountable but over the last three years I have been out there and won world titles, world silver medals, Olympic silver medals and I have done that out of my own pocket.'
