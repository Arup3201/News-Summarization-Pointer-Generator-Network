Two pilots were killed as their planes collided over the Nevada Desert yesterday, sending them crashing them near a dry lake bed.

A four-seat, single-engine Cessna 170 and an unidentified aircraft crashed in mid-air at about 8am yesterday morning, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said.

There were no other people on board the two planes and no one on the ground was hurt.

Both pilots were found dead at the scene, 10 miles north-west of Yerington, Nevada, and are yet to be identified, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported. 

It is not known why they crashed. 

Police Sergeant Ryan Powell said: 'Deputies met with witnesses on scene who stated that two airplanes collided north of the dry lake bed and crashed into the side of a hill.'

Witnesses described hearing a 'pop', before seeing debris falling from the sky and smoke rising from over a hill. 

Jack Lyons, who rushed to the scene to try to help, said: 'Everyone was in shock.' 

Several airplanes were flying in and out of the dry lake bed, which is used as a makeshift runway, over the weekend, the sheriff's office said in its statement.

The FAA and the National Transportation Safety Board will investigate, the crash. 

The pilots' families are yet to be informed.
