Sentencing: Howard Randall pictured outside Hammersmith Magistrates Court today shortly before he was jailed for a benefit scam

A fraudster who claimed more than £12,000 in housing benefits by claiming to live alone despite sharing a flat with his boyfriend has been jailed for four months today.

Howard Randall, 54, shares the head porter's flat at Lowndes Lodge, in Belgravia, with his partner of 20 years.

But he forged documents which claimed he lived alone in a vacant studio apartment in the same landmark block in order to be eligible for £115 benefits per week.

Unemployed Randall even forged documents in an attempt to claim back payments when his benefits were stopped after he went on holiday to the Far East for several months.

Sentencing Randall at Hammersmith Magistrates Court, Judge Howard Fanning said: 'This was a calculated deception from the outset, targeting public funds to satisfy your own greed.

'You then tinkered with the scam to make further funds for yourself.'

The court had heard that Randall had forged a lease and various letters from individuals purporting to be the landlord and the landlord's agent in order to claim benefits for more than two years.

After he went to Thailand for 'a number of months', his Jobseeker's Allowance was stopped and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea called his case in for review.

When he returned he made another application for housing benefit and asked for it to be back-dated.

He even submitted a fraudulent letter claiming that the rent had been increased in a bid to up his payments to £150-a-week.

Prosecutor Roger Hodkinson said: 'This was clearly a planned fraud and the only explanation offered was that he had received requests for council tax payments, which he and his partner did not think he was liable for.

'The flat was empty and Mr Randall decided to make and application for housing benefit even though he did not occupy the flat and the fraud continued for over two years.

'Not only was this a fraud initially, but Mr. Randall decided he could get more.'

Council investigators visited the flat in July last year and after confirming it was not occupied called Randall in for an interview.

'He signed a statement that was effectively a full confession. He admitted it was greed,' explained Mr Hodkinson.

When initially claiming benefit in April 2010, Randall declared he had no savings, but told investigators he financed his trip to Thailand from a nest egg.

He received £10,324 in housing benefit and £2,104 in council tax benefit in total.

Defending Randall Naomi Alcendor told the court her client needed funds to finance civil legal proceedings in 2010.

She said: 'This fraud was run at this time and he knows there is no excuse and there is no justification.

'He was not working and money was extremely tight and under pressure he made some unwise choices and is extremely remorseful.

'Money is now being deducted from his benefits. A nominal amount.'

There was no court order for compensation and the council have indicated they will not pursue a civil claim against Randall.

Randall pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud by false representation on various dates between May 2010 and July last year and three counts of making an article for use in fraud on various dates between April 2010 and July last year.
