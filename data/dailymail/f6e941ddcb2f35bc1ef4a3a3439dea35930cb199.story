Living up to his name: Calvin E. W*** 56, was arrested for 'public lewdness'

Many parents christen their young ones along the lines of Star, Hero and Destiny, in the hopes that they later aspire to live up to their name – unfortunately some monikers do not exactly encourage greatness.

Unfortunately named Calvin E. W*** was arrested at a petrol station after allegedly being caught ‘pleasuring himself’ in public.

Police were called to the Love’s Travel Stop in Binghamton, New York, on Saturday morning after several witnesses reported Mr W***’s actions.

State troopers arrived at the petrol 
station just after 10am on Saturday after truck drivers reported Mr 
W***’s inappropriate behaviour.

They
 alleged that the 56-year-old was ‘committing sexually lewd acts while 
in the parking lot and field next to the truck stop,' Syracuse.com reports.

It was not immediately clear exactly what Mr W*** was doing outside the truck stop, located about an hour south of Syracuse.

Mr W***, of Deposit, New York, has been charged with public lewdness, a misdemeanor, state police in Binghamton said.

Mr W*** was issued a ticket at the scene, and is scheduled to appear in court next month.
