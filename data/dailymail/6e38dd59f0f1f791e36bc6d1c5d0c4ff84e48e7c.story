A man has appeared in court charged with the manslaughter of a two-year-old boy in a suspected gas explosion which flattened a number of homes.

Jamie Heaton died in the blast while watching TV in his home in Shaw, Oldham, on June 26.

Andrew Partington, 27, who was injured in the incident, has been charged with manslaughter and causing criminal damage worth more than £1 million and appeared at Oldham Magistrates’ Court yesterday.

He appeared at Manchester Crown Court today via prison videolink and has been further remanded in custody.

He will next appear in court via videolink for a plea and case management hearing on November 21.

A provisional trial date was fixed for February 4 with an estimated length of five to seven days.

Partington suffered 40per cent burns 
and a broken back in the explosion in Buckley Street and was recently 
brought out of a coma at the hospital where he was treated.

Partington,
who had a bandaged left arm, a bandaged right hand and appeared to be 
wearing a back-brace, came into the dock with difficulty and was helped 
to sit down by two police officers who remained with him during the 
hearing.

He spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address.

The
seat of the blast was at his rented terrace house, which was next door 
to the home of Jamie and his parents, Kenny and Michelle.

Wreckage: The blast was so powerful it flattened three houses on Buckley Street in the Shaw area of Oldham, Greater Manchester

Carnage: Debris from the massive explosion sent bits of masonry flying over a wide area around Buckley Street, Shaw in Oldham

Rubble: The massive blast turned three houses instantly into rubble

The massive explosion flattened number 11 Buckley Street, where Jamie lived, and number 9, where Mr Partington lived. The two houses are separated by an alleyway.

A number of houses caught in the blast zone will have to be demolished

Following Jamie’s death, his parents 
paid tribute to 'our little man' who was 'a happy little boy, 
mischievous and full of laughter'.

Chief
Crown Prosecutor for CPS north west area Nazir Afzal said: 'I have 
today advised Greater Manchester Police to charge Andrew Partington with
the manslaughter of Jamie Heaton, aged two, and causing criminal damage
valued at over £1 million to houses in Buckley Street, Shaw, Oldham, on
June 26 2012.

'Police were 
called to the scene of a gas explosion in Buckley Street at around 
11.15am where two houses, number nine and number 11, were destroyed in 
the blast and other homes damaged.

Injuries: Andrew Partington, left, with his partner Tanya Williams, had a bandaged left arm, a bandaged right hand and seemed to be wearing a back-brace as he appeared in court

Tragic: Jamie Heaton, two, was killed instantly in the blast in June, this year

Agony: tearful parents Kenny and Michelle look at tributes to their two year old son Jamie

Grief: Michelle And Kenny Heaton visit the scene of the blast and lay a tribute to their two-year-old son Jamie

'The seat of the blast was in number nine and Jamie, who was in the living room of his home at number 11 watching television, died as a result of the explosion. I would like to express my sympathy to Mr and Mrs Heaton on their tragic loss.

'After considering the evidence, I am satisfied there is sufficient to charge Andrew Partington with manslaughter and criminal damage.

'The decision was taken in accordance with the code for Crown prosecutors.'

Greater Manchester Police will be taking no further action against a man arrested in connection with a fatal explosion in Shaw.

The bail of the 32-year-old man, who was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter, has been cancelled by police.
