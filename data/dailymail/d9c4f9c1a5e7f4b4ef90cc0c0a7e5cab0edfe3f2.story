Cost: Many single people said they would travel on their own if the prices were not geared towards couples, families or groups of friends

Nearly half of those who are single in Britain did not take a holiday last year with many blaming the travel industry for pricing them out of the market.

They believe costs for travelling on your own make it too expensive to go abroad. 

Many said they would travel on their own if the prices were not geared towards couples, families or groups of friends, according to analysts Mintel.

It found 45 per cent of those who are either not married, divorced or widowed did not take a foreign holiday in 2012. 

This compares to just 28 per cent of married adults who did not go away last year, said the study.

Package holidays in particular, as well as accommodation, car hire and other accessories, are generally a lot more expensive for anyone travelling on their own or in odd numbers.

Many packages add single person supplements for those not sharing a room and other hotels charges rates by the room so two sharing pay half as much as a person on their own.

Only 12 per cent of Britons say personal safety puts them off going away on their own - rising to 19 per cent of women and falling to five per cent of men.

Almost half, 49 per cent, of single adults say it is the cost that deters them from travelling while three in four say the travel industry does not cater well for single travellers.

Around half say the lack of holiday packages for single people deters them from going away on their own - only 20 per cent are put off travelling by having no one to go with.

Census figures suggest 53 per cent of the adult population of England and Wales are either unmarried, divorced or widowed, up from 32 per cent in 1971.

Of these, almost 12 per cent are not strictly single as they are cohabiting with a partner - but the rest are on their own, which amounts to 41 per cent, or more than four in ten adults.

Priced out: Almost half of Britain's single adults say it is the cost that deters them from travelling abroad

John Worthington, Mintel Senior Travel Analyst said: 'Singles remain under-represented in the leisure travel market.

'Major tour operators are investing in "couples-only" brands but the perception of the majority of singles (especially older singles) is that the industry has little to offer them beyond escorted group tours which are not to everyone's taste.

'Brands that can speak to this growing demographic - especially single young professionals and divorced/widowed over-55s - are likely to be rewarded with loyalty.'
