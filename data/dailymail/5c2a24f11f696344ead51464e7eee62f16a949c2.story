Outgoing NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson faces questions from MPs again today after revelations about secret severance payments

Hospital bosses have spent more than £2million on 52 secret severance payments, igniting new controversy over the gagging of whistleblowers.

The revelation will increase the pressure on outgoing NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson, who had promised to investigate the problem.

He remains in his £270,000 post until next year despite presiding over the Mid Staffordshire hospital scandal which cost the lives of 1,200 patients.

In March, it emerged that Gary Walker was paid £500,000 to go quietly under  judicial mediation from his post as chief executive of United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust.

Sir David told an influential Commons committee this was ‘a one-off’, but promised to look into the issue.

Asked if there were any other examples, he replied: ‘It is the first time in my  experience that I have ever seen that done. I have asked around and I do not think there is another example.’

However, figures uncovered by Conservative MP Steve Barclay through Freedom of Information requests flatly contradict Sir David’s assertion.

Mr Barclay has discovered that 32  hospitals spent more than £2million in 52 judicial payments to whistleblowers in the three years to March. Six more hospitals have admitted making similar gagging payments, but refused to disclose the amounts. Another 50 hospitals have not replied, which indicates the final figure is likely to be higher.

Two consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals were paid £300,000 and £265,000 respectively. The payments were made in February – a month before Sir David assured MPs the deal with Mr Walker was an isolated case.

The two consultants even worked for a hospital  in the same county as Mr Walker.

Northampton General Hospital paid £50,000 to a whistleblower in 2011/12 and £95,000 to another the following year.

The Royal United Hospital Bath NHS Trust went through a mediation before paying £128,000 to four outgoing staff in 2010 (although no gagging orders were made). And Great Ormond Street 
Hospital handed over £38,000.

Today, Sir David appears before MPs on the Public Accounts Committee again to explain the apparent contradictions.

Mr Barclay said: ‘I find it hard to believe that this  practice had been going on for so long and Sir David knew nothing about it. He is the accounting officer for the NHS and so it is his duty to know how the money is spent.

‘After Sir David gave evidence in March, I repeatedly asked his office about the progress of his investigation.

‘As no information was forthcoming I decided to find the information myself.

‘I was staggered that there had been so many secret  payments to gag potential whistleblowers. I’m even more staggered Sir David apparently knew nothing. Far from being one off, this is a systemic problem.

‘I’m concerned these gagging payments are much more widespread. These new figures apply only to hospital trusts.

‘I suspect the ambulance, mental health service and community trusts will have used the same method.’

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the MPs’ committee, will also be furious. The Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust, which is in her East London constituency, made a secret payment of £28,000 earlier this year.

The statistics have forced Health Minister Daniel Poulter to change the rules. He said approval for judicial mediation payments will now be needed from the Chancellor or Health Secretary.

In April, NHS Employers, which represents trusts on staff issues, said the payments must be ‘exceptional’ and have Treasury approval.

The six who refused to publish the costs of their gagging deals include Guy’s and St Thomas’s NHS Trust, which is yards from the Commons.

In March, Mr Barclay found that in the three years to 2011, there were 598 ‘special severance payments’ costing £14.7million in the NHS with strict confidentiality clauses. Unlike the mediation payments, they were signed off by the NHS and Treasury.

Articles in June about secret severance payments to NHS staff said that two consultants at the Northern Lincolnshire and Goole Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust were paid ‘hush money’. We are happy to clarify that while the consultants in question were paid £300,000 and £265000, they were not asked to sign gagging orders and continue to work for the trust.
