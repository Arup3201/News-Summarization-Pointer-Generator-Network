Former NBA player Keon Clark leaves the Vermilion County Courthouse in Danville, Illinois: He was sentenced to eight years after striking a plea deal

Former NBA star Keon Clark was yesterday sentenced to eight years in prison after striking a plea deal with prosecutors over weapons and driving under the influence charges.

At Vermillion County Circuit Court in Illinois Clark pleaded guilty to two charges in two separate cases and was given four years for each count.

He previously faced weapon, drug and traffic-related charges.

'I, uh, did a lot of stuff in my past,' Clark tearfully said at his plea hearing, reported Illinois' the News-Gazette. 'I have to own up to it.'

The 38-year-old, originally from Danville, Virginia, was 23 when he became the 13th overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He last played for the Utah Jazz and Phoenix Suns.

Clark has spoken publicly of his long battle with alcohol, which he says also occurred during his NBA career. He now says he’s been sober for five months.

He previously told the newspaper he wasn’t prepared mentally to handle the lifestyle of a professional athlete, and says he was already on a 'destructive path.'

'The money, the fame, the fact that I was on TV. People think money will make your life better. Money didn’t dissolve my problems. It increased them,' he said, adding that he’s been getting counselling while he’s in custody.

Clark has been in the Vermilion County jail since August 4.

Prosecutors said he will have to serve 50 per cent of his sentence, but he will receive credit for 138 days already served and must serve his sentences consecutively.

Clark’s defence attorneys requested that the judge recommend he serve time at an Illinois Department of Corrections drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility outside Chicago so he can continue treatment.

Attorney Jim Martinkus of Champaign said after the hearing that he hopes Clark’s treatment would 'cure him of his addiction, which is the cause of most of his troubles.'

Clark smiled and waved to supporters at the beginning of the hearing, including his mother and members of the Carter Metropolitan Community Church in Danville.

At one point during the hearing, he stood and addressed them, saying, 'It could’ve been a lot worse. It’s going to be a lot better.'
