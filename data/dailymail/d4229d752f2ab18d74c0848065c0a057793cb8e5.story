A woman is suing Neiman Marcus after the luxury retailer refused to refund $1.4million worth of goods that her ex-husband gave to her.

Patricia Walker from University Park, Texas wanted to return the goods after learning that her ex-husband had been having an affair with her own 'trusted' Neiman Marcus personal shopper.

The collection of clothing, jewellery, accessories and artworks had been given to Ms Walker over the three years she had spent recovering from a serious car accident.

Not happy: Patricia Walker (above) from University Park, Texas, is suing Neiman Marcus after the store refused to refund $1.4million worth of goods bought for her by her ex-husband. She claims she never wanted the gifts

Expensive taste: The women's now ex-husband was allegedly cheating on her with her own personal shopper from Neiman Marcus, who received a commission on the goods, some of which are pictured above

The accident, which occurred in 2007, left her bedridden for a majority of the time.

Favi Lo, the female personal shopper who had an affair with Ms Walker's ex-husband, Robert Tennison, received a 'steep commission' from the purchases according to the plaintiff's attorney Mike Ticer.

Mr Ticer is assisting his client in filing a lawsuit against the store on the grounds of 'fraud', 'deceptive trade practices' and a 'violation of company policies' which normally allow customers to return goods within a specified time frame.

She had only learned of the alleged affair in 2010, which was just a few months into the couple's divorce. She closed her account with the store immediately after she found out.

Cheater: Favi Lo (above), Ms Walker's personal shopper, is said to have received a steep commission on each of the ex-husband's purchases. She is still employed at the department store in Dallas

Ms Walker was a loyal customer; she had spent $100,000 per year at the store up until her accident.

Her husband's total purchases, which are described as 'like new' or in 'mint condition', outweighed her own by hundreds of thousands of dollars between 2007 and 2010.

In 2009, his purchases totaled $850,000.

Mr Ticer told ABC that the gifts, including a pair of earrings worth $30,000 and a pair pf pajamas worth $285, were items that his client 'couldn't wear and never really wanted'.

He said: 'The product of these sales is sex for merchandise.'

Distasteful: Mike Ticer (pictured), the woman's attorney, claimed the gifts were items she 'never really wanted'

The store's return policy states: 'If for any reason you are not satisfied, we will gladly accept your 
timely return of unworn, unwashed, or defective merchandise.

'Returned 
merchandise should include the vendor packaging and tags and be in the 
same condition as when it was received. Used merchandise cannot be 
returned unless defective. A pickup and/or restock fee may apply.'

After Ms Walker had requested that the goods be refunded, the store sent staff out to inspect the merchandise.

Mr Ticer said 'the store never followed through or offered an explanation for not taking the items back'.

Location: The Neiman Marcus store in Dallas where Ms Walker's ex-husband purchased the large amount of goods. His mistress, the personal shopper who earned commission on the purchases, still works there

He expressed further disapproval over the company's choice to keep Ms Lo as an employer. She is still employed at the retailer's NorthPark Mall location in Dallas.

He said: 'The real villain in this case is Neiman Marcus. After 
learning of this affair, they decided they weren't going to do anything about 
it.'

As for the merchandise, it is currently being held in storage under tight security.
