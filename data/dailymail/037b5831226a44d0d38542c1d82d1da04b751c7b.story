Conservative climate change sceptics have been ordered to ‘shut it’, by the Lib Dems.

Energy Secretary Ed Davey said there was ‘overwhelming evidence’ of the need to cut carbon emissions.

He singled out former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson and Conservative MP Peter Lilley for particular criticism, in the latest coalition spat over the environment.

Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey said climate change sceptics in the Tory should 'shut it'

The Lib Dems have stepped up their attacks on the Tories over the environment in recent weeks.

Mr Davey told EurActiv, a Brussels-based news website: ;My recommendation to most politicians who want to talk about the climate is to listen to the scientists and listen to the evidence.

‘Of course you can question it, but when there is overwhelming evidence you should tend to shut it.’

Mr Lilley responded: ‘People who try to silence their critics are revealing their own inability to respond to the arguments that people like I and Nigel Lawson put.

‘I don’t question climate science. I just question the interpretation [Mr Davey] puts on it.’

It follows comments by Lord Lawson last month when he insisted there was no evidence that extreme weather was linked to climate change, and urged scientists to admit they did not know what was happening.

He said: 'I think we want to focus not on this extremely speculative and uncertain area. I don’t blame the climate scientists for not knowing.

'Climate and weather is quite extraordinarily complex and this is a very new form of science. All I blame them for is pretending they know when they don’t.'

Mr Davey has previously attacked ‘diabolical’ and ‘wilfully ignorant, head in the sand, nimbyist’ Conservatives who question global warming.

But Michael Fallon, the senior Tory minister in Mr Davey’s energy department, hit back at his boss, insisting: ‘Unthinking climate change worship has damaged British industry and put up consumer bills.’

Tory Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, seen as a leading climate sceptic in the Cabinet, has attracted criticism for not setting out his views publicly.

One Cabinet minister told MailOnline: ‘He just isn’t very bright. Most of the people around the Cabinet table are bright, even if I disagree with them, but not Owen. He isn’t climate sceptic, he’s climate stupid.’

Today Mr Paterson told BBC Radio 4: ‘The climate is changing and there is clearly a human element.’
