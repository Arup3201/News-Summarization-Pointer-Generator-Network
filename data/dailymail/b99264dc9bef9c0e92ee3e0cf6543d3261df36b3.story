Michael Sam just got into the NFL, and now he's landed his own TV deal.

The first-openly gay football player to be selected in the draft will be the focus of a new multi-part documentary series to air on Oprah's OWN network, produced by the same crew that filmed Lindsay Lohan's reality show.

'We are honored that Michael is trusting us with his private journey in this moment that has not only made history but will shape it forever,' Oprah Winfrey said in a statement.

From the football field to Hollywood: Michael Sam, the first openly-gay man to be drafted into the NFL, will be the star of his own reality TV show, Oprah Winfrey announced Wednesday

Cameras are rolling: The show has reportedly already started filming and crews were in the room when Sam got the call that he had been drafted and kissed his boyfriend in celebration

'I am proud of the focus on authentic storytelling in our new documentary series format. The next real-life story we follow in ‘The Untitled Michael Sam Project’ promises to spark valuable, important discussion on life in America today. Acceptance and illumination start here,' Winfrey added.

The announcement was somewhat surprising since Sam said at a press conference yesterday that he just wants to focus on training.

When asked what it felt like to the the first openly-gay draftee, Sam said simple: 'I guess it's great.'

'I'm determined to be great so I'm going to train hard and try and make the team,' he added.

Shooting has already begun on the as-yet untitled project, but it's uncertain how much access the NFL and Rams will grant them now that Sam is in training.

The series will follow Sam as he trains to make the St Louis Rams 53-man roster for next season - which will not be without challenge.

Sam was named SEC Defensive Player of the Year during his time at the University of Missouri, but is considered too small to be a defensive end in the league at six-foot-two and 261 pounds.

Most likely, he'll have to focus on learning a new position if he wants to make the team for the season.

But in a Tuesday press conference, Sam said the attention he's received will only help his training.

'Thank God for you guys making this all a big deal, because it’s just going to make me a better player than I am now,' Sam said.
