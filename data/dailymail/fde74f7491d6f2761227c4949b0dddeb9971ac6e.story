A teenage mother-of-one who underwent an abortion because she felt it was too soon to have a second child died after contracting a superbug during the procedure, an inquest heard today.

Jessie-Maye Barlow, 19, contracted the superbug streptococcus B in a one in 10,000 chance that caused 'catastrophic damage' to her heart.

Five weeks after the termination, Miss Barlow was rushed to hospital where she died just five days before Christmas.

Tragic: Teenage mother Jessie-Maye Barlow, 19, died after contracting a superbug during an abortion

The young mother had given birth to a baby girl in June and then found out in the autumn that she was pregnant again.

She and her partner, Daniel Fountain, thought it was too soon to have another child and decided to have an abortion.

In November, Miss Barlow took medication designed to bring about an abortion at a specialist clinic in Richmond, south west London.

After suffering bleeding and low mood, 
she attended an NHS walk-in centre in Ashford, Middlesex, on December 8,
where staff referred her straight to the West Middlesex Hospital.

Doctors at West Middlesex Hospital diagnosed a case of superbug streptococcus B and that Miss Barlow had 'retained products of conception' meaning her body had not managed to pass everything associated with the pregnancy.

Despite surgery and medication, her health continued to suffer over the following 10 days.

Then on the evening of December 20 her family called an ambulance after she emerged from a shower complaining of severe chest pain.

She was rushed from her home in Staines, Surrey, to St Peter’s Hospital, in nearby Chertsey, where she died hours later.

Pathologist Dr Michael Hall told the coroner: 'This is one of the more extreme examples of this condition.'

He said the bacteria had destroyed one of the valves on Jessie-Maye’s aorta and had then spread to and attacked her heart.

Dr Hall continued: 'If the valves suddenly fail and the blood rushes back into the heart, the heart cannot cope with it.

'The heart will stop functioning and the patient will die.'

Dr Richard Lyus, of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, who carried out the termination, said the incidence of infection following such a procedure was uncommon, between one in 800 or 1,000, while the chances of contracting a serious infection like Miss Barlow was closer to one in 10,000.

He added: 'The rate of a very serious infection such as what Jessie had would probably be closer to one in 10,000.'

He said that following her death he 
had reviewed medical literature and found no other case of someone 
experiencing what she had following an early medical termination.

He
also conceded that when Jessie had failed to call the clinic in early 
December as part of the follow-up procedure, the clinic had not called 
her over the following days as they should have done.

He added: 'Unfortunately it was simple human error.

'I think, yes, Jessie should have been contacted and they would have spoken to her and advised her to go to hospital.'

The inquest, before Alison Hewitt, the assistant deputy coroner for Surrey, continues at Woking, Surrey.

Diagnosis: After suffering continued bleeding, Miss Barlow was referred to West Middlesex Hospital where she diagnosed with having contracted streptococcus B and treated with medication and surgery
