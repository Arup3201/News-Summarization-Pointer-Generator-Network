A budding young movie-maker who secretly film the unappetizing meals being served up at his elementary school has seen his results become an award-winning documentary.

New York City public school student Zachary Maxwell, now 11, started filming his school lunches in the fall of 2011 because of a dispute with his parents about whether or not he should be allowed to take lunch to school.

While his parents wanted him to eat the school’s lunches, which sounded appetizing on the school’s menu, Zachary wanted to prove that the menus weren't accurate.

Over a six month period, Zachary sneaked a video camera into his school cafeteria and filmed his less-than-appetizing meals.

With help from his father, those undercover reports were turned in a 20-minute film called ‘Yuck: A 4th Grader’s Short Documentary About School Lunch.’

‘The city’s Department of Education says
 that it’s committed to providing “delicious and nutritious meals 
through their food service program.” But the lunch being served at my 
school was nothing like what they were advertising on their website,’ 
says Zachary in the trailer for his film.

The documentary has already won the budding young filmmaker, who goes by his first and middle names, several film festival awards and it is set to be screened at the Manhattan Film Festival next month.

His project was almost derailed at one point after he was caught filming without his teacher¿s permission

Since the film's release, Zachary has been asked to serve as an adviser to the New York City Department of Education's Office of School Food and brings his school lunch from home

The film is highly entertaining and reveals Zachary to be a mix of guerrilla film-maker Michael Moore and healthy food crusader Jamie Oliver.

In one clip Zachary talks about how the education department enlisted the help of celebrity chefs including Rachel Ray and Ellie Krieger to create appetizing healthy options, but then he shows the limp salads the school was serving which didn’t feature the ingredients the chefs had recommended.

A spokesperson for the school board has 
accused Zachary of doctoring footage by selectively serving himself 
lunches that didn’t include certain elements.

His project was almost derailed at one point after he was caught filming without his teacher’s permission. Zachary was instructed to delete the footage, but only pretended to, reports Manolith.
