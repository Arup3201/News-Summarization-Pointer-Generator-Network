Indian officials said there had been a 
threat against its diplomats in Afghanistan, but gave no other details.

Although
 no group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, it is 
believed to be a local group affiliated with the Taliban.

Afghanistan is experiencing a rise in insurgent attacks as foreign troops
 plan to withdraw from the country by the end of the year and as the 
country faces a coming runoff presidential election.

Officers
 thought there could be a fourth gunmen involved in the fighting as 
gunfire came from different directions, local police spokesman Raouf 
Ahmadi said police killed two gunmen.

Syed
 Akbaruddin, a spokesman for India's Ministry of External Affairs, said a
 deployment of the paramilitary Indo-Tibetan Border Police at the 
consulate held off the assault until Afghan forces arrived, and all Indian nationals at the consulate were safe.

'Our consulate and our diplomatic presence in Afghanistan have been under threat,' Akbaruddin told TimesNow TV, without elaborating.

Herat lies near Afghanistan's border with Iran and is considered one of the safer cities in the country, with a strong Iranian influence.

In September 2013, Taliban gunmen launched a similar assault on the U.S. Consulate in the city, killing at least four Afghans but failing to enter the compound or hurt any Americans.

Foreign embassies and consulates remain a favorite target of insurgents in Afghanistan, but many are protected by high walls and multiple gates, as well as security forces.

India has invested more than $2billion in Afghan projects, including roads and power projects. In August 2013, a botched bombing against the Indian Consulate in the Afghan city of Jalalabad near the border with Pakistan killed nine people, including six children.

No Indian officials were hurt. Two attacks on the Indian Embassy in Kabul in 2008 and 2009 that killed 75 people.

Groups known for targeting Indian interests include Lashkar-e-Taiba, which was blamed for the 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed 166 people, and the Haqqani network, which is based in Pakistan's lawless tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.

Lashkar-e-Taiba has been active in Afghanistan in recent years, often teaming up with insurgent groups operating in the eastern part of the country near the frontier with Pakistan.

In 2010, two Kabul guest houses popular among Indians were attacked, killing more than six Indians. India blamed that attack on the group.

The violence comes as the Taliban has launched its annual spring offensive promising to step up attacks against Afghan security forces in a bid to undermine the Western-backed government.

The Taliban also have pledged to disrupt voting as Afghans prepare for a second round of presidential elections on June 14.

The first round was relatively peaceful, but no candidate won a majority forcing a runoff vote between the top two candidates â€” Abdullah Abdullah and Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai.
