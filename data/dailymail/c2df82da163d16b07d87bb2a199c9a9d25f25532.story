For ten years, she wore false eyelashes every day to give her the glamorous look she craved.

But Caroline Medcalf’s ‘addiction’ to the enhancements came at a price, damaging her natural lashes so severely that hardly any were left.

In desperation, the 42-year-old sought medical  help – and has now become the first patient in the UK to go public after undergoing a pioneering eyelash transplant.

Ms Medcalf, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, (pictured after her transplant) said her life has been transformed by the eyelash transplant operation at the Crown Clinic in Manchester

Miss Medcalf spent £4,000 having 70 eyelashes  transplanted into her eyelids in a three-hour operation.

A
strip of hair was taken from the back of her scalp and the individual 
hair follicles removed. The surgeon then threaded each hair into the 
skin at the bottom of her eyelids using a special needle.

Miss
Medcalf said: ‘I am so pleased I have had it done. The only new beauty 
routine I will have to adopt is curling and trimming my new lashes every
couple of weeks.

‘Because they are made from head hair they grow in just the same  way and need more grooming than natural eyelashes.’

The
finance director was left with just three eyelashes on her upper right 
lid and 19 on her upper left lid after years of damage caused by gluing 
on extensions.

She said: ‘I was spending around £100 every couple of months buying them, along with the glue and solutions for my eyes.

Consequences: Caroline Medcalf, 42, said she ended up looking like a 'frog' when she lost most of her natural lashes

Pictured her with her transplanted lashes, Ms Medcalf said: 'It feels like a miracle to have hair on my eyelids when for so long there was nothing. I will now have lovely long, natural eyelashes for the rest of my life - and need never wear false eyelashes again'

‘I
would never take them out and left no time for my normal eyelashes to 
recover after their use. Gradually my lashes started falling out – which
made me even more dependent on the extensions.’ The damage was made 
worse when she got an eye infection a year ago which caused itching, and
she rubbed off many of the weakened lashes that were left.

Increasing numbers of women are damaging their eyelashes permanently due having overindulged in synthetic lashes like Ms Medcalf (pictured)

With
almost completely bald upper lids, Miss Medcalf was too embarrassed to 
leave her house or let her family, boyfriend or friends see her without 
false eyelashes.

She recalled: ‘I ended up looking like a frog. I could not bear to look at myself in the mirror.’

But
Miss Medcalf, from Worsley, Greater Manchester, said her life has now 
been transformed by the operation at the Crown Clinic in Manchester. The
procedure was pioneered in America and brought to the UK by surgeon 
Asim Shahmalak, hair loss expert on Channel 4’s Embarrassing Bodies.

Dr
Shahmalak, who carried out Miss Medcalf’s transplant, said: ‘Lots of 
women permanently damage their eyelashes by overusing false ones. The 
glue can block the hair follicle and they can end up losing their 
natural lash.

‘The problem has been made worse by the boom in their use in recent years, thanks to celebrities such as Cheryl Cole.

‘I
also see women needing eyelash transplants who have suffered from 
trichotillomania – a psychological conditions which sees them rip out 
their eyelashes.’

Dr 
Shahmalak said the transplant procedure was becoming more popular in the
UK, though Miss Medcalf is the first patient to talk about her 
experience publicly.

He added that her new lashes will take at least six months to look their best – but should then last ‘for the rest of her life’.

Dr Shahmalak said Ms Medcalf's new lashes will take at least six months to look their best but should last for the rest of her life with regular trims and curls every few weeks

More women are damaging their eyelashes permanently in pursuit of full eyelashes and Ms Medcalf had weeping eyelids after losing her natural pair
