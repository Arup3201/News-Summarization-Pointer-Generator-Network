An alcoholic drink can be as fattening as a doughnut – but most consumers have no idea about the calorie overload, campaigners warn.

Pressure is growing for drink companies to be compelled to label alcohol bottles with the number of calories in a bid to tackle obesity.

A Krispy Kreme original glazed doughnut contains up to 190 calories – around the same as a large glass of wine or pint of lager.

More than three-quarters of the public did not know or wrongly guessed the calories in a large glass of wine

Even a standard 175ml glass of wine – containing between 126 and 160 calories – can be as fattening as a Cadbury’s Hero miniature or a slice of rich Madeira cake.

But more than three-quarters of the public did not know or wrongly guessed the calories in a large glass of wine, a survey found. Nine out of ten had no idea what a pint of lager contained. Tests showed those given more information drank 400 fewer calories by choosing different forms of alcohol, the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) said.

Its poll found two in three adults want to see calorie labels on alcohol.

It is calling on the drinks industry and the EU health commissioner to introduce calorie labelling for alcoholic drinks – currently not classed as food – because irresponsible drinking is fuelling an obesity epidemic.

The move was backed by campaigners Alcohol Concern but drinks producers said the new laws could take years to pass and voluntary action by the industry was the way ahead.

RSPH chief executive Shirley Cramer said: ‘There is a clear public appetite for this information. With two in three adults overweight or obese, and given that adults who drink get approximately 10 per cent of their calories from alcohol, this could make a major difference to waistlines of the nation.’ Calories in wine vary with colour and sugar content; a small 125ml glass of dry white has about 85 calories, sparkling 90 calories, sweet white 120 and red 120.

The RSPH has urged the labelling change to be brought in throughout the EU and called for more research into the relationship between drinking and weight. Its poll of 2,117 British adults found most either did not know or underestimated the calories in a glass of wine and a pint of lager.

Alison Tedstone, of Public Health England, said: ‘Alcohol is almost as calorific as fat, which people don’t realise. If you think, if you have a couple of glasses of wine with a meal that’s like having an extra course.’

Alcohol Concern chief executive Jackie Ballard said: ‘You walk into any shop and the calorie, fat content, sugar and more are on the back of food packets and we don’t see why alcohol should be any different.’

But The Portman Group, which represents alcohol producers, said a decision on labelling would rest with the EU and could take years.

A spokesman said: ‘The industry takes all health-related issues regarding alcohol very seriously and actively promotes and funds Drinkaware, which provides calorie information through apps and on its website.

‘Drinks producers are open to discussions about calorie information. However, it is essential that alcohol content, not calories, should primarily inform consumer decision-making.’

■ Stronger wines should be taxed more heavily than those containing less alcohol, the public health minister said. Jane Ellison told MPs she wants to vary the duty on bottles of wine – with the hope of pushing drinkers towards buying lower-strength wines.

Tax on beer is varied on this basis. Stephanie Lis, of the Institute of Economic Affairs, criticised the plan, saying: ‘Wine is already enormously over-taxed.’
