At this rate the politicians will be sticking their children down as election expenses.

Ed Miliband yesterday took the 'Hello-isation' of general election coverage to a whole new level.

He invited ITV's breakfast telly to accompany him on the school run with his little sons. Folks, it was a heart-melter. Gooey as hot marshmallow. Well, that was the intention, anyway.

Viewers heard the Leader of the Opposition engage dear little Daniel, five, and Samuel, four, in Daddy talk and tell them a story about Boo-Boo and Hee-Hee.

Were these nicknames for certain members of the shadow cabinet by any chance? Oddly enough, they were not, though there might be no shortage of candidates for Boo-Boo.

Boo-Boo and Hee-Hee were in fact fictional beings of Mr Miliband's creation and they lived on a place called Faraway Planet.

'Nobody visits them because they are far away,' explained Mr Miliband with a logic so faultless you could almost call it Marxist. He and his wide-eyed sons were walking down a London street, accompanied by no one – except, that is, an ITV film crew.

Presenter Ben Shephard was holding Daniel's hand. Can anyone remind me of Mr Miliband's position about Press intrusion into private lives?

Any idea that it was normal for Mr Miliband to take the little ones to school was soon dashed.

He admitted it was 'a rare treat' for him. Oh, so you mean he only did it to give us a false impression that he is a new man?

Mr Shephard put on a pair of spaniel eyes and asked if Ed ever felt guilty about missing his boys' childhood. 'I do, I do,' came the eager reply.

Many working blokes make similar sacrifices, mind you. It's called life.

The rest of ITV's interview was conducted at the Milibands' house, the children by now having been parked. Ed was asked about his brother David – the one he stiffed for the Labour crown. Cain and Abel minefield.

'We had a bruising leadership contest four years ago. He's moved on from that. I've moved on from that,' insisted Cain.

It is certainly true to say David has moved on from it. He moved to New York! 'He's got his own thing that he's doing,' said Ed. 'He wants to focus on that.' Got that, David?

If all this was toe-curling, wait till you hear what Shepard asked next. He mentioned Mr Miliband's lovely wife Justine, noted how busy their lives were, and asked our would-be prime minister: 'How do you keep the romance going?' Strewth. How much detail were we after here?

Even Mr Miliband looked a bit staggered at this descent into bedroom territory.

Pinkening, he said 'that's a good question'. He added that 'there's nothing more we like than a night in, just spending some time together'. Enough, enough! The interview was the last in ITV's breakfast TV one-to-ones with the party leaders. Alleluia. Much more of that and I'd have emigrated to Faraway Planet.
