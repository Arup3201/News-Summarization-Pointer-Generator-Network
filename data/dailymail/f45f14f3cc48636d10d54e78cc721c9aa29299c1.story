It may look like the lovechild of a garden shed and an exclusive 1920s Rolls Royce but this little beauty is expected to raise an incredible £250,000 when it goes on sale.

Don't be fooled by the odd and rather strange looking appearance, this rare 1928 Rolls Royce Phantom is thought to be the world's first estate car and therefore has a starring role in automotive history.

The roller was transformed into a troop-carrying motor to assist in the war effort after engineers removed the roof and rear half of the bodywork.

historic milestone in automotive development worth £250,000. It is 
claimed to be the world's first estate car

They then welded on the wooden section to the original chasis creating a large carriage in the back.

All that newly created space allowed the military to ferry personnel around during World War 2.

And as a result of the refit the vintage car was given the name 'Shooting Brake' and became the forerunner to estate-loving marques like Volvo.

This Rolls Royce Phantom 1 Shooting Brake is currently owned by a wealthy Dutch car collector who has decided it is time to move it on to a new home.

Rare design: The 1928 Phantom limousine was commandeered as part of the 
war effort and adapted to carry RAF ground crew around airfields during
Britain's darkest days

The car will go under the hammer at auction house Bonhams Paris automobile sale and due to its unusual design and historical interest is expected to sell for hundreds of thousands of pounds.

Robert Glover, a specialist in vintage cars at Bonhams, said: 'Shooting Brakes were very popular in the fifties and sixties and were the first type of estate cars.

'If you had an old Rolls Royce then it probably looked a bit tired and worn out but mechanically it would have been fine.

'Rather than just scrap it, people would lop off the back half and replace it with a wooden construction.

'The chasis, wheels, engine, bonnet and wings would have remained the same.

'They were ideal for carrying hunting
or coach parties across country estates which is why estate cars of 
today are called estate cars.

'The Shooting Brake for sale was one of the first to undergo the unusual change.

'Before
the war, Rolls Royces were sold as a running chasis with an engine and 
bonnet but the body was totally separate and made by coachbuilders to 
the clients taste.

'This one was used as a limousine and was owned by the Right Honourable G Fryer who kept it from 1928 until 1939.

'He
then either loaned it or it was commandeered by the RAF for the war 
effort and turned into the Shooting Brake. The back doors would have 
opened up and everybody would have piled in.'

Wood you believe it's a roller? The 1928 Phantom goes on sale at Bonhams in Paris at the start of February

Who wood have thought it? The estate even has a folding rear seat in the back, as well as these extra, but still matching, chairs

After the war the car was bought by Mirabel Topham whose family owned Aintree racecourse in Liverpool.

Aintree, home of the Grand National, had a motoring racing circuit built in the middle of it in 1953 and it hosted the British Grand Prix five times.

The Rolls Royce, still with its Shooting Brake contraption on the back, was used extensivelywithin the grounds as a safety car for both horse and motor racing.

It has had several owners over the years and was completely restored by its current owner in2008.
