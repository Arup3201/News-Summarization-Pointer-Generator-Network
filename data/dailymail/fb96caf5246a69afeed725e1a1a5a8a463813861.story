Drugs including poppy straw and morphine have been found aboard a Greenpeace ship whose crew were detained for protesting against Arctic oil drilling, Russian authorities claimed today.

The illegal 'narcotics' were discovered after armed officials boarded the vessel as environmental activists attempted to scale an oil platform  in the remote Pechora Sea in the Russian Arctic.

Teams from the Russian coastguard 
abseiled onto the Arctic Sunrise from helicopters and arrested 30 crew members, including six UK nationals, last month.

Russian authorities seize the Greenpeace ship the Arctic Sunrise and detain the crew following a protest by activists at a Russian oil platform.

The group has since been held on piracy 
charges although officials claimed today that given 'new evidence' of 
drugs being found on the ship the charges could now be 'modified.'

In a statement published on Russia's Investigative Committee website, a body equivalent to the FBI, spokesman Vladimir Markin said 'narcotic substances (probably poppy straw and morphine) were 
confiscated during the search on the ship.'

He added that 'the origin of these substances and their purpose are being investigated' and warned that charges already brought against the Greenpeace activists could be 
altered.

'Taking into consideration the data received in the course of the 
investigation of the criminal case, the charge already filed against 
everyone is set to be adjusted,' a statement said.

'It's obvious to the investigation that a number of individuals will be charged with committing other grave crimes.'

Poppy straw, the husk left after ripe poppy seeds are extracted from the plant, is a raw material that can be used for
illegally producing heroin or morphine.

It is recognised as a narcotic substance, 
the possession, sale, purchase or use of which without a valid license is against Russian law.

Today, Greenpeace flatly denied any possibility of there being illegal drugs on board their vessel. But in comments likely to further escalate the row between Russia and the Netherlands, where the Arctic Sunrise is registered, Russian authorities also hinted at the possibility of banning the import of Dutch tulips and dairy products into the country.

The head of Russia's veterinary and 
plant monitoring service revealed an ongoing audit of Dutch dairy products had 'been unsatisfactory'.

Sergei Dankvert also accused his Dutch 
counterparts of approving the safety of dairy produce 'without seeing 
the product' as well as improperly labelling exports.

Separately, Mr Dankvert's spokesman, Alexei 
Alexeyenko, claimed Russia had additional problems with the quality of Dutch tulips and other flowers the country 
has been exporting across Europe for many centuries.

'We are not only talking about flowers but also... planting material,' he told Russian News Service radio.

'In other words, we are talking about a full range of products imported from the Netherlands,' he added.

Russia has often been accused of 
using trade as a diplomatic weapon. On Monday it banned dairy imports from Lithuania, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, following the Baltic state's 
attempt to draw ex-Soviet countries such as Ukraine closer to the 
28-nation bloc.

Tensions with the Netherlands first 
surfaced last week when the country filed a legal case against Russia's 
arrest of the crew of the  Arctic Sunrise in September.

Greenpeace claim the vessel was illegally 
seized by former KGB agents from the FSB secret service in international
waters, 1245 miles north of Moscow above the Arctic Circle. 

The activists - who come from 18 
countries including the United States - all face jail terms of up to 15 years. The entire crew has been placed in pre-trial detention for two 
months by Russian authorities pending an investigation by 'detectives and criminal experts'.

Relations deteriorated further yesterday when Russia accused the Netherlands of illegally detaining
a top Moscow diplomat in The Hague over allegations of domestic abuse.

Russian authorities now claim they have discovered illegal drugs during a search of the Greenpeace vessel.

Russian President Vladimir Putin 
called the detention at the weekend of diplomat Dmitry Borodin 'the most
gross breach of the Vienna Convention' and demanded a formal apology. The Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations grants diplomats immunity from arrest.

The Dutch side responded by saying it was 
investigating the incident and would only apologise 'if the 
investigation shows that this was handled in a way that contravened the 
Vienna Convention'.

Today, a spokesman for Greenpeace said Russian claims that illegal drugs were found on board its ship were 'a fabrication, pure and simple.'

A statement on its website read: 'Before leaving Norway for the Russian 
Arctic, the ship was searched with a sniffer dog by the Norwegian 
authorities, as is standard.

'The laws in Norway are amongst the 
strictest in the world, and nothing was found because nothing illegal 
was on the ship.'

A source for the campaign group added: 'Any claim that something other than medical supplies was found should be regarded with great suspicion. Nothing was found because nothing illegal was on the ship.'

Last week Russian officials charged 28 activists and two journalists who were on board the Arctic Sunrise with piracy. 

The Kremlin did not initially respond to a demand by Greenpeace chief Kumi Naidoo who called for meeting with President Putin and offered to travel to Russia and remain in the country as security if his campaigners were released.
