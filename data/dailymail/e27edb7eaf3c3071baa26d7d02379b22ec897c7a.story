A woman who collapsed with a seizure discovered she had been living with a tumour half the size of her brain.

Donna McWhinnie, 26, had no idea she had the cancerous glioma tumour, which had been growing for 10 years, until she was rushed to hospital after a sudden seizure.

The tumour was 10cm by 5cm - half the size of her brain. The young mum had never suffered any serious health problems before she fell ill suddenly on February 24.

Donna McWhinnie (pictured with her son, Taylor), 26, was diagnosed with a brain tumour after she collapsed while staying with a friend. Doctors were amazed that she had not experienced any other symptoms

Ms McWhinnie, who lives in Wishaw, South Lanarkshire, had been staying at a friend's house when she collapsed in the bathroom.

She said: 'I had been staying at my friends pub in Falkirk and I woke up the next morning feeling unwell but thought it might just be a hangover.

'I was numb all down my right side. Someone handed me a can of Irn Bru, I was holding it but I couldn't feel it in my hand.

'I hit my head on the bath but thankfully my friend Pamela was there. She saved my life.'

Pamela, 25, who now lives with Ms McWhinnie, raised the alarm and put her friend in the recovery position.

She said: 'It was really scary but I knew Donna needed me so I stayed really calm.'

Ms McWhinnie's tumour is slow-growing but she has had to have radiotherapy and may also require chemotherapy

Ms McWhinnie was rushed to hospital in Larbert where she suffered two further seizures before being transferred to Edinburgh for an MRI scan which confirmed the tumour on the left side of her brain.

She said: 'It is a glioma tumour which is slow growing and is grade two on a scale of one to four, four being the worst.

'The doctors couldn't believe that I have had no symptoms. I have been through childbirth but felt nothing in my head.

'The part of my brain affected is the area associated with emotions.

'I am not an emotional person and I never cry. So that makes a bit of sense.'

Ms McWhinnie underwent a biopsy and then radiotherapy at the Beatson Cancer Centre, in Glasgow, which she attended five days a week for six weeks.

The tumour caused epilepsy which left her unable to drive.

Ms McWhinnie, who is mother to 21-month-old Taylor, has amazed her friends and family with her resolve in the face of serious illness and gruelling treatment.

She said she is determined to keep her spirits up for the sake of her son and added: 'Taylor has no idea, he keeps me going.

'I have been told that it could flare up again in the next 10 to 20 years and I could need chemotherapy.

'But I don't want to know when that might happen and I am not waiting around for it.'

Ms McWhinnie is now epileptic so is not allowed to drive. She gave up her job as a hair dresser to do charity work and to spend more time with Taylor

Ms McWhinnie was given good news when a scan revealed her tumour had not increased in size and the pressure in her head had reduced.

She said: 'The tumour was never going to get any smaller but it is good to know that the pressure is reduced.

'The doctors told me that they are really surprised that I wasn't crippled with headaches because of the pressure in my brain.

More than half of all primary brain tumours are gliomas.

They develop from the glial cells in the brain and are malignant but slow-growing.

Symptoms include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures and vision problems.

Gliomas are rarely curable but the prognosis depends on the grade of the tumour - they are graded from one to four with grade one and two tumours counting as low-grade and grade three and four tumours counting as high-grade.

The most common forms of treatment are radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

Patients with high-grade gliomas only have a 50% chance of surviving for a year after diagnosis.

People with low-grade gliomas have a 50% chance of living for ten years after their diagnosis.

'There is a chance that it will grow again in the future and I will need chemotherapy but for now I just have to monitor my symptoms and go for regular checkups. At the moment I feel fine.'

Ms McWhinnie's positivity has amazed her proud family and her mother Lesley McWhinnie said of her daughter: 'Nobody could fill Donna's shoes - I don't know where she gets the strength.'

Ms McWhinnie is determined to live her life to the full and has given up her hair salon in Wishaw to spend as much time as possible with her son.

After discovering her tumour she has selflessly decided to dedicate her time to helping others.

She organised an action-packed fundraising night in Wishaw recently and hundreds of friends and family members turned up to support her.

She said: 'It was a great night and I would like to thank everyone who donated so generously.

'We raised £3,000 for The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre and £3,000 for Brain Tumour Research.

'My target was £5,000 so I am really pleased that I managed to raise so much.

'Life is what you make it. If I lie down and let this tumour beat me then it will.'
