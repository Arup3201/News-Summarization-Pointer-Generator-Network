The U.S. government used taxpayers' money to buy semi-automatic weapons, then sold them to criminals and allowed the guns to disappear, a leaked document reveals.

The bombshell disclosure undermines the Department of Justice's defence that Operation Fast and Furious, under which the arms-dealing was sanctioned, was a 'botched' operation where agents merely 'lost track' of weapons.

In the document, obtained by Fox News, Federal Agent John Dodson was given signed approval by a supervisor at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to purchase six semi-automatic Draco pistols.

Mr Dodson then sold the pistols to known illegal buyers, while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby, and ultimately allowed the weapons to vanish into the underworld, Fox News reported.

Begun in October 2009 as part of Project Gunrunner, which aimed to deprive Mexican drugs cartels of guns, Operation Fast and Furious gave agents the go-ahead to sell firearms to smugglers in a bid to gather intelligence and see where the guns ended up.

In total, U.S. officials allowed the sale of more than 2,000 guns to the Sinaloa cartel, worth $1.25million.

The leaked document reveals that in June 2010, the ATF allowed the U.S. government to become the actual 'seller' of guns.

In a letter dated June 1, 2010, then Phoenix ATF Group VII supervisor David Voth instructed a Federal Firearms Licensee in Arizona to allow for the purchase of ‘four (4) CAI, Model Draco, 7.62x39 mm pistols, by Special Agent John Dodson.’

It read: 'These aforementioned pistols will be used by Special Agent Dodson in furtherance of the performance of his official duties.'

In the lower left-hand margin of the one-page letter is the hand-written note: 'Picked guns up 6/10/10 Paid Cash'.

Mr Dodson then sold the weapons to known illegal buyers, while fellow agents watched from their cars nearby.

This was not a sting operation, where police sell to a buyer and then arrest them immediately afterwards, Fox News reported.

In this case, agents were 'ordered' to let the sale go through and follow the weapons to a stash house.

Sources told Fox News that Mr Dodson felt strongly that the weapons should not be abandoned and the stash house should remain under 24-hour surveillance.

However, Mr Voth disagreed and ordered the surveillance team to return to the office. Mr Dodson refused, and for six days in the desert heat kept the house under watch, defying direct orders.

A week later, a second vehicle showed up to transfer the weapons, Fox New reported. Mr Dodson called for an interdiction team to move in, make the arrest and seize the weapons, but Mr Voth reportedly refused and the guns disappeared with no surveillance.

According to a story posted on a website dedicated to covering Fast and Furious, Mr Voth gave Mr Dodson the assignment to 'dirty him up,’ since Mr Dodson was a vocal critic of the operation.

'I think Dodson demanded the letter from Voth to cover both himself and the FFL (Federal Firearm Licensee). He didn't want to be hung out to dry by Voth,' a source told the website Sipsey Street Irregulars.

Mr Dodson has turned whistleblower on the Fast and Furious Operation, giving interviews with CBS News which detail how guns were allowed to 'walk' across the border into Mexico.

The practice erupted into the public consciousness in December last year when 40 year-old Brian Terry, a member of an elite U.S. Border Patrol tactical team, was shot and killed during a violent gun battle in a remote Arizona canyon just north of the U.S. border with Mexico.

Two guns 'walked' by ATF were found at Mr Terry’s murder scene, just south of Tucson.
