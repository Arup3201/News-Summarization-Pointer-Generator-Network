Living legend Candice Bergen says at 68 she is happy being fat and lives to eat

At 68 and after a full and varied career which has taken in modeling for Vogue, an Oscar-nomination and countless Emmys for her hit TV show Murphy Brown, Candice Bergen says she is happy being fat and now lives to eat.

In her new memoir, A Fine Romance, the living legend estimates she has put on 30 pounds in the past 15 years, but says she simply doesn't care.

'In the past 15 years... I have put on 30 pounds. I live to eat. None of this "eat to live" stuff for me. I am a champion eater. No carb is safe — no fat, either,' she readily admits.

'At a recent dinner party I shared bread and olive oil, followed by chocolate ice cream with my husband. A woman near me looked at me, appalled, and I thought, "I don't care,"' she writes.

Women over 50 typically have to choose between preserving either their face or their butts and she writes that she has happily chosen the former.

'Dieting is out of my purview,' she confesses. 'I crave cookies... all the things that dilate my pupils.'

Her skinny friends and their constant battles to remain thin only reinforce her belief that she is doing what is right for her.  

'They maintain their weight by routinely vomiting after major meals consisting of a slice of steak or a filet of fish,' she writes. 'I am incapable of this.'

In her new book, A Fine Romance, Candice Bergen talks at her joy at playing feisty TV reporter Murphy Brown for 10 seasons.  'She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless,' she writes

The brutally honest appraisal of her current weight is just one of the topics up for discussioin in her new book, which comes out on April 7, reports Vogue.

The follow-up to her 1984 memoir Knock Wood, A Fine Romance focuses on her 15-year marriage to French director Louis Malle who died of cancer in 1995 and her career-defining role as funny, feisty career woman and TV news reporter Murphy Brown.

The hit TV show ran for ten seasons between 1989 and 1998 and Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five. 

After her fifth win, Bergen declined future nominations for the role. 

Initially she writes that she wasn't thrilled at the idea of acting in a TV show, but after reading the script she realized it was 'written for me.'

'The lead was a television news reporter. She was big, she was brassy, she was fearless. 

'Smart, fast-paced, and funny, the dialogue was similar to the great comedies of the 1940s. 

Bergen was nominated for an Emmy Award seven times, winning five, for her role as Murphy Brown, left. In the 1960s she had also modeled for Vogue as her acting career was taking off, right

'There was something in the writing of the Murphy character that hooked me, as she eventually hooked many women. 

'Is it that she was, in many ways, who we wished we could be as women? Successful in a field dominated by men? Free of the need to please? Impolitic, impolite, yet in some weird way, irresistible?'

Despite the network initially trying to have the role rewritten for a younger actress such as Heather Locklear, writer-producer Diane English insisted it had to be about a 40-something woman fresh out of the Betty Ford clinic.

'The character fit me like a glove. I was instantly comfortable with the writing,' recalls Bergen. 

'Diane had created a complex, original, endearing, feisty, take-no-prisoners woman. And more surprisingly, a woman who cared not a whit what others thought of her. That character gave me permission to be my brattiest, bawdiest self.'

Bergen writes that the character was the first time she felt able to thrown myself into a role 'with such abandon and joy.' 

Bergen won acclaim early in her acting career for roles in movies such as The Adventurers, left, and has a new autobiography, A Fine Romance, out in April

After working as a fashion model and featuring on the cover of Vogue, Bergen's acting career began in the mid-60s with films such as The Sand Pebbles and The Adventurers. 

In 1979 she received best supporting Oscar and Golden Globe nominations for Starting Over.

But while her big screen roles had played on her 'glacial Nordic looks', the role of Murphy Brown allowed her to express must more range.  

'What I had going for me was the element of surprise. No one ever expected me to be funny, not least because of my glacial Nordic looks and affect,' she writes. 

'I'd mostly been reviled in my acting career. My Oscar nomination for Starting Over was an anomaly; basically I'd had fifteen years of bad notices by the time Murphy came along.'

As well as receiving recognition for her acting talent, Bergen said the role also saw her receive recognition as a style icon.  

'I wanted every outfit to be an event. And in a way, they were. Women loved what Murphy wore,' she writes.

Bergen even lays claim to inventing the open-backed baseball cap.

Bergen was married for 15 years to French director Louis Malle before he died of cancer in 1995

'When I wanted to wear a baseball cap with a high ponytail, we couldn't find one with an opening in the back, so Judy McGiveney, our wardrobe woman, made one by cutting a hole in the back,' she writes.

'A couple of months after the show aired, you could buy them in any store. Now they're standard.'

Bergen writes that she enjoyed ten years of 'insane fun' playing Brown.  

'Yet I never wanted it to end; doing Murphy Brown was insanely fun. When the writing was good, it was a giddy, joyous experience. I was the most comfortable and confident I'd ever been,' she writes. 

'The part was a godsend—a fantastic role that completely suited me. My friends were all happy for me; it was unusual for a woman my age to get that role and that success.'

Since the show ended in 1998, Bergen has appeared in movies including Miss Congeniality and Sweet Home Alabama, as well as staring in Boston Legal for five seasons.

She has also made guest appearances on many other TV shows, including Seinfeld, Law & Order, Family Guy, Will & Grace and Sex and the City.

Bergen is now married to New York real estate magnate and philanthropist Marshall Rose.
