Paramedic Alan Clark MBE has been found guilty of misconduct

A decorated paramedic who did not bother trying to revive an unconscious 93-year-old woman on Christmas Day has been found guilty of misconduct.

Alan Clark MBE decided the pensioner was dead after she stopped breathing even though there was still heart activity.

He shunned a colleague’s offer of a defibrillator and took little or no action for more than ten minutes before calling the clinical help desk for advice.

Clark eventually asked for his own defibrillator to be fetched, but did not use it and made no efforts to perform CPR before declaring the woman dead.

He told a Health Professions Council hearing the woman was already dead when he arrived at the Birchwood Care Home in Ilford, Essex.

But a three-man panel rejected his claim and decided that his fitness to practise was impaired due to his misconduct.

Clark will now hear his fate at a later date yet to be announced after the panel ran out of time.

Student paramedic Corinne Zeiderman, who was on the call on Christmas Day 2010 with Clark, said he did not tell his colleagues what he was doing and just sent her to fetch equipment.

‘We were saying her heart rate was getting slower, but he was on the phone in the doorway and waved his hand, to be quiet, he was not interested and he was busy’, she said.

‘At that point, there were still things we could have done for her.

‘Even if it is not going to get anywhere, it is still worth going through the motions. You never know.’

Ms Zeiderman and a colleague reported Clark to bosses on their return to base at Whipps Cross Ambulance Station in east London.

The HPC panel ruled that he had made no efforts to save the woman and there was no evidence she was dead when Clark arrived.

But Clark told the hearing sticking to the guidelines would ‘cramp his style’ in the future, and that patients would lose out.

Gillian
Fleming, who chaired the hearing, said: ‘Mr Clark told the panel that 
he had fully reflected on the incident and that he is always learning.

‘He explained that he has reviewed his practice and undertaken extensive study.

‘However, he also said that he stands by his actions and he would only act differently with regard to communication with colleagues so they would understand his reasoning.’

Ms Fleming added: ‘What Mr Clark said about how he would approach further events of cardiac arrest did not give confidence that he would operate within the relevant guidelines.

‘This indicates a lack of real insight into this incident and demonstrates that he does not accept the validity of those guidelines.’

Clark, who was given an MBE in 2007 for his work in the ambulance service since 1985, was accused of being an unreliable witness whose story had changed several times.

‘In a number of significant matters, we have found that Mr Clark’s subsequent accounts have both varied between themselves and departed from the events as they are recorded on the day’, Ms Fleming said.

Clark offered reasons during the hearing why he failed to attach a heart monitor, opted not to use the defibrillator, or start CPR.

He also claimed to have been under stress during the incident because members of the woman’s family were upset.

The panel dismissed his excuses and ruled his fitness to practice was impaired because of misconduct.

They had earlier dismissed allegations that Clark had simulated resuscitation to appease the family of a dying patient on an earlier occasion, due to lack of evidence.
