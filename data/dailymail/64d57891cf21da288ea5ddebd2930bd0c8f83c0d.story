When night-time security guard Greg Heaslip left a note with his manager asking for time off, he thought the only person to see it would be his supervisor.

Instead, Greg's bungling boss forwarded an email request to 3,500 fellow Arcadia employees - the retail giant that manages Topshop, BHS, Miss Selfirdge and Dorothy Perkins.

The request went viral yesterday as staff set about trying to '#givegregtheholiday' on Twitter, with one travel company offering him free flights to Las Vegas.

But speaking to Mail Online, Mr Heaslip, 38, revealed he will be giving everything to charity and going to Chessington World of Adventures instead.

Viral: Greag Heaslip, a security guard, became an internet sensation after his holiday request spawned a Twitter campaign to '#getgregtheholiday'

He said: 'I handed in the holiday request on Wednesday, just left a slip of paper on my boss's desk and thought nothing else about it.

'The next I heard of it was yesterday evening at about 5.20pm when I came in for my next shift, I had absolutely no idea.'

Despite receiving free flights to Las Vegas, a tuxedo and various other goodies, Mr Heaslip says he will be donating it all to charity and going to Chessington World of Adventures instead

Mr Heaslip, who has worked as a security guard for six years, added: 'I'm still in shock.

'All I wanted was my two days off an now I've got them. I'm going to go to Chessington World of Adventures with my wife Edyta and our 20-month-old daughter.

'I don't want any of the free stuff. I'm going to donate it all to the Stephen Sutton charity so it goes to a good cause.'

The viral sensation all started as a joke between Arcadia staff, who began tweeting each other pictures of their clogged email inboxes after the message was accidentally sent out.

As staff shared the request, one employee tweeted a picture of her computer which crashed under the weight of emails, while another started a hashtag asking bosses to give Greg his time off.

The campaign soon spread to the surrounding offices, with workers opposite the Arcadia building posting messages on their windows in support of Greg.

But the message soon spread across the whole of the UK, becoming one of the highest trending topics on Twitter, beating the European elections.

It didn't take long for companies to jump on the bandwagon, offering Greg all sorts of supplies for wherever he might end up going, but it was TrekAmerica who stepped forward to offer him free tickets to Las Vegas.

It started with an email: Security guard Greg's holiday request went viral online, ending up with him being offered a free holiday

Greg got the holiday: the moment trek America set Greg up with a dream holiday, but he's decided to donate everything he's been given to charity

Holiday outfit: Trek America had a T-shirt made up and will be sending it to Greg in time for his trip

Styling it out: VO5 were also quick to jump on the bandwagon, offering Greg freebies

While Greg relaxed at home, unaware of the whole campaign, other brands followed, offering Greg a holiday wardrobe from BHS and Topman, a VIP shopping session for any female companion from Miss Selfridge and free toiletries from Elemis.

And the freebies didn't stop there. After Trek America offered him a free holiday, they even got a T-shirt made up to celebrate the occasion, while VO5 got in on the action, offering hair products and promising: 'What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas'.

Inundated: One Arcadia employee tweeted this picture of her email inbox after the request was sent

Where it all began: Arcadia worker Kimberly Jaina appears to be the first person who started the Twitter campaign, resulting in Greg's annual leave becoming one of the highest trending topics

Campaign: The hashtag soon took off, with companies lining up to offer Greg freebies

TrekAmerica eventually dropped Greg an email to let him know about his good fortune.

It
 read: 'Hi Greg, I hope you’re well and had a nice sleep. I’m sure 
you’ve been blissfully unaware of what’s been happening today, but are 
now fully up to speed with recent developments regarding your 
colleagues’ campaign to #givegregtheholiday.

'Well, we thought it would be nice if you really did get that holiday, so we’re offering you a Mini Adventure around the USA’s west, including flights from the UK to Las Vegas. 

'No, this isn’t a joke – we’re really sending you to Vegas!

Welcome to Las Vegas: Greg had the last laugh, after he was offered a free trip to the US, but turned it down for a trip to Chessington

Freebie: The security guard would have stayed in Vegas and gone to tour the Grand Canyon and Monument Valley, but has turned the gifts down

'In case you haven’t heard of TrekAmerica, we offer small group trips around the USA, Canada, Alaska and Central America and have been around for over 40 years. Our ethos is fun and adventure, which is exactly what we think you’ll need after being at the centre of today’s Twitter frenzy!'

The letter goes on to outline the trip that Greg will receive - taking in the Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, and spending a night in an authentic cowboy camp.

He would also have received two nights before and two nights after the trip at a hotel in Las Vegas, but has decided to give all of it away.
