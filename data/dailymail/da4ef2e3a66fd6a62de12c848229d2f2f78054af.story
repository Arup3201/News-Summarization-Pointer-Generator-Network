A Kansas sperm donor has been forced to pay child support for a child he helped a lesbian couple conceive in 2009.

A Shawnee County judge ruled Wednesday that William Marotta, the biological father of a child born to Jennifer Schreiner, must repay some $6,000 in public assistance the state has provided the child as well as future support payments.

Schreiner and her partner Angela Bauer found Marotta on Craigslist and performed the insemination at home.

Because there was no physician present, the judge ruled Marotta didn't meet the legal criteria of a sperm donor, so Marotta is the father in the eyes of the state.

This despite the fact the Topeka man signed away his parental rights before the child was conceived.

‘Quite simply, the parties failed to perform to statutory requirement of the Kansas Parentage Act in not enlisting a licensed physician at some point in the artificial insemination process,' wrote Shawnee County District Court Judge Mary Mattivi in her decision.

'The parties’ self-designation of (Marotta) as a sperm donor is insufficient to relieve (Marotta) of parental right and responsibilities to the child,’ Mattivi continued.

The Kansas Department for Children and Families filed the case in October 2012 seeking to have Marotta declared the father of a child born to Schreiner.

Never seen her before: Marotta argued he'd waived his rights as a parent before the 2009 conception and that he barely knew the woman with whom he fathered the child

Technicalities: Shawnee County District Judge Mary Mattivi disagreed with Marotta. She ruled that the agreement failed to include a licensed physician and therefore did not live up to the state's legal definition of sperm donation

The state was seeking to have Marotta declared the child’s father so he can be held responsible for about $6,000 in public assistance the state provided, as well as future child support.

Marotta opposed that action, saying he had contacted Schreiner and her partner at the time, Angela Bauer, in response to an ad they placed on Craigslist seeking a sperm donor. He said he signed a contract waiving his parental rights and responsibilities.

Attorneys for the state contended the contract was moot because the parties didn’t follow a 1994 Kansas law requiring a licensed physician to perform the artificial insemination when donors were involved.

During oral arguments at a hearing in October, Timothy Keck, co-lead counsel for the state, said the case focused on child support. Marotta’s attorney, Benoit Swinnen, cited several court rulings he said support the argument that Marotta is legally a sperm donor and not required to pay child support.

Swinnen also argued that the Kansas statute doesn’t specifically require the artificial insemination to be carried out by a physician.

Court documents show Schreiner indicated 
she didn’t know the name of the donor or ‘have any information’ about 
him in her application for child support. However, a sperm donor 
contract between Marotta and the couple includes his name, and the 
agency noted the couple talked about their appreciation for him in an 
interview with the Topeka Capital-Journal.

Soluble bonds: Bauer and Schreiner performed the procedure alone in their own home in 2009. They have since separated

A filing Wednesday by the DCF argues the sperm donor contract overlooks ‘the well-established law in this state that a person cannot contract away his or her obligations to support their child.’

The right for support belongs to the child, not the parents, the filing says.

The agency said it also received different versions of the donor contract from Marotta and Schreiner, suggesting that the document ‘may be invalid on its face.’

‘We stand by that contract,’ Swinnen said. ‘The insinuation is offensive, and we are responding vigorously to that. We stand by our story. There was no personal relationship whatsoever between my client and the mother, or the partner of the mother, or the child. Anything the state insinuates is vilifying my client, and I will address it.’
