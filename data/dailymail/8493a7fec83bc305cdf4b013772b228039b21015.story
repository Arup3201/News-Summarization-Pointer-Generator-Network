Donna Ricketts, who avoided jail despite admitting throwing a glass in the face of a model in a nightclub leaving her scarred 

A mother-of-three who left a model scarred for life after throwing a glass in her face at a nightclub has been spared jail for the sake of her young children.

Donna Ricketts flew into a rage at the Bijou nightclub in Salford, Manchester, attacking the 27-year-old victim, who narrowly escaped losing an eye.

Ricketts, 31, pleaded guilty to wounding but escaped a prison sentence after Manchester Crown Court heard she was the single mother of three children, with the youngest being just 18-months-old.

She was also spared paying out £1,800 in compensation to her scarred victim after claiming she could only repay £50 a month from her benefits.

Instead, the victim will receive just £250 unless she pursues compensation in a civil action.

Prosecutor Simone Flynn told the court that a dispute broke out in the club between the victim's group of friends and Ricketts' group of friends after the victim lost her handbag in the early hours of May 11.

Ricketts lost her temper in the melee, first throwing her glass at the young woman, causing a deep, gaping wound below her left eye.

The victim, a health worker, who worked as a part-time model before the incident, revealed how traumatised she has been left by the attack.

In a victim impact statement read by Miss Flynn, she said: 'I have been told even if I have surgery I will be left with a scar on my face permanently.

'I had to take a month off work while I was recovering and I am regularly suffering from severe headaches and twitches in the left eye.

'I feel my clients may take an unfavourable view of me because I have a scar.

'It may be several months before I am able to do modelling work again.

'The incident has definitely knocked my confidence.'

Anthony O’Donnell, defending, said Ricketts ‘retaliated’ after she was shoved from behind and a drink was thrown over her.

The attack happened during a melee after the victim lost her handbag at the Bijou club in Salford, Manchester, pictured 

He said the aspiring child psychologist had never intended the injury and was ‘shocked and dismayed’ at her actions.

He also added that she was well thought of by those who knew her and would never appear before a court again, describing the offence as ‘without a shadow of a doubt a one-off’.

Sentencing her to 18-months, suspended for two years, with supervision and 80 hours unpaid work, Mr Recorder Shaw said the injury was ‘horrific’ and ‘dreadful’.

He added: 'I have no doubt at all that in front of pretty much any other judge you would go straight to jail.

'But you have three children and I have to ask myself, would it do any good?'
