Tim O'Connell and his wife (pictured here) were driven to their wits end by the rowdy fraternity members next door 

A Texas fraternity at the Southern Methodist University has suspended eight members for terrorizing their neighbors.

Security footage of rowdy Sigma Chi brothers filmed by Tim O'Connell, 42, reveals how they would urinate on his fence, write obscenities into the snow on his yard, spit on his house and throw raw meat onto his patio.

Just like the Hollywood movie Neighbors, starring Seth Rogen and Zac Efron, the dispute began when O'Connell and his wife complained about the noise from the off-campus students, who lived in an upmarket home near to SMU.

'I brought it to their attention and said 'you can't do that.' They told me they pay rent and they can do whatever they want. It's their right,' O'Connell recounted to News 8.

In a statement to address the behavior of their members, the Sigma Chi fraternity said that hopefully now the O'Connell's will be able to sleep better.

'The apology is just the first step in making amends to you for the tenants' actions. I am also working on various forms of punishment for the culprits,' wrote Steve Harrington, Sigma Chi chapter advisor, in an e-mail to O'Connell that was shared with News 8.

Appalled by the actions of their neighbors, O'Connell and his wife set up a camera and caught the young men next door violating their property and hurling abuse their way.

Like a movie: Tim O'Connell's experience was reminiscent of the Zac Efron and Seth Rogen comedy 'Neighbors' which featured a married couple battling a party-loving fraternity 

O'Connell told News 8 the disgusting behavior escalated after he complained about their noise.

In response to viewing the footage of their members urinating on O'Connells fence and writing f*** you into the snow on their front lawn, the fraternity have said they will also fine the members.

'I want to make this a learning opportunity for these men,' Harrington wrote in the e-mail to O'Connell. 'I believe that community service and charitable work and/or donations would show them a way to get out of themselves. I believe that being young and self-centered is the main contributor to the behavior they displayed, showing no regard for others. We need to teach them otherwise.'

O'Connell claims he asked SMU for help before, but got no response.

According to News 8 an investment firm is the owner of the the home and they admitted that O'Connell has had problems with the tennents before.

One of the investors told News 8 that the fraternity will be leaving in May.
