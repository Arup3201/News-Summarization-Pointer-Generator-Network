Allegations: Chris Ling, 56, is accused of a catalogue of sex abuse against young female students

A violin teacher accused of a catalogue of sex abuse against young female students faces the threat of extradition proceedings so he can be put on trial in this country, it emerged yesterday.

Chris Ling, 56, moved to the U.S. after a previous police probe over allegations that he preyed on girls at Chetham’s School of Music in Manchester ended without charges.

However a series of new allegations were made following last year’s conviction of the school’s former director of music, Michael Brewer, for indecently assaulting Frances Andrade 30 years ago.

The 48-year-old mother-of-four committed suicide during his trial after enduring a torrid cross-examination.

Another four music teachers are currently on bail after being arrested in a major police investigation into allegations of historic sex abuse centring on Chetham’s and the Royal Northern College of Music, also in Manchester.

Mr Ling moved to the United States in the early 1990s and runs a talent management agency from his Los Angeles base.

Yesterday, police said he had been invited to return to Britain for questioning by detectives, but had failed to comply. They added that steps to extradite him would now be considered.

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'A full file of evidence has been compiled and submitted to the CPS in relation to complaints against Chris Ling.

'That review process will necessarily involve the consideration of commencing extradition proceedings.

'We are working closely with the CPS as part of this process.' 

More than 30 women have made complaints that they suffered sexual abuse from classical music teachers at the two colleges or in private tuition and 39 people have been investigated, five of whom are now dead.

Last February, the Guardian newspaper reported claims from ten women that Mr Ling abused them in the 1980s while he was a freelance teacher at Chetham’s.

They claimed he would instruct girls as young as 15 to strip naked during lessons or spank their bare bottoms.

Contemporaries described how his pupils were known as ‘Ling’s strings’ and that he bragged about taking nude pictures of them.

Mr Ling, who is married to a former pupil, Pippa Clarke, now a concert violinist, has repeatedly declined to comment about the claims by reporters who have approached him in Los Angeles.

Brewer was jailed for six years last March after he was found guilty of indecently assaulting Mrs Andrade when she was 14 and 15.

His trial heard allegations that sexual activity between teachers and pupils at Chetham’s was not uncommon in the 1980s.

Among those on bail are violin teacher Wen Zhou Li, 57, a professor at the RNCM and a former teacher at Chetham’s, who was held last February on suspicion of rape.

Renowned double bass teacher Duncan McTier, 58, was arrested at his home in London in May over allegations of sex abuse against a woman in her 20s in the mid-90s at the RNCM.

Internationally acclaimed conductor Nicholas Smith, 65, from Macclesfield, Cheshire, was held in July on suspicion of committing sexual offences against a 15-year-old girl in the late 1970s while she was a pupil at Chetham’s.

Former Chetham’s teacher Malcolm Layfield, 61, was arrested in August on suspicion of three historic rapes against three females, two aged 16 and one 18, between 1980 and 1991.

The former head of strings at the RNCM was re-arrested in October on suspicion of the rape and indecent assault of a woman when she was aged between 18 and 21.

The institutions concerned have insisted the allegations are historic and that child protection policies have been changed significantly since the period they cover.
