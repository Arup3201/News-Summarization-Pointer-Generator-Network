American feel: Author Jhumpa Lahiri, who has been nominated for this year's Booker prize for her novel The Lowland, was born in London but now lives in New York

American authors will be allowed to compete for Britain’s most prestigious writing prize for the first time next year.

The decision to open the Man Booker to US writers has prompted a raft of criticism from the literary world, with many fearing the move will prevent fledgling British authors from gaining recognition.

The prize is currently only open to writers from the Commonwealth,  Ireland and Zimbabwe.

But it is understood that organisers of the award – which has catapulted the careers of some of Britain’s leading authors – believe that excluding American authors limits the Booker’s global significance.

This year’s shortlist, announced last week, has already raised eyebrows for its distinctly American feel.

Four already live and work in the US, including Jhumpa Lahiri, 46, shortlisted for her novel The Lowland.

Born in London and of Indian origin, she was raised in Rhode Island and now lives in New York.

Another who is already widely considered American is US-born Ruth Ozeki, a 57-year-old Buddhist priest who also holds a Canadian passport.

Broadcaster and author Melvyn Bragg was among those from the literary world who has criticised the proposal.

Mr Bragg said: ‘I’m disappointed… though not that  surprised. The Booker will now lose its distinctiveness.

‘It’s rather like a British company being taken over by some worldwide conglomerate.’

Jim Crace, the British author whose novel Harvest is favourite to win this year’s award, claimed the move would make the Booker ‘lose a focus’. He said: ‘In principle, I should believe in all prizes being open to everyone.

‘But I think prizes need to have their own characters, and sometimes those characters are defined by their limitations.

‘If you open the Booker prize to all people writing in the  English language, it would be a fantastic overview of English language literature but it would lose a focus.

‘I’m very fond of the sense of the Commonwealth. There’s something in there that you would lose if you open it up to American authors.’

Another British author,  Stuart Evers, wrote on Twitter that such a change would have a ‘massively detrimental effect on British and Commonwealth literary fiction’.

Coconut Unlimited author Nikesh Shukla wrote: ‘I  think writers at my level will get crowded out of the market.’

A spokesman for the award declined to comment yesterday but said that changes are due to be announced in the near-future.

This year’s winner of the prize, founded in 1969, will be announced on October 15.

Last year’s winner was Hilary Mantel, the first woman to win the Booker twice.
