The devastated son of a woman murdered last year told jurors how his mom's body was dragged out of her home - as the court played a surveillance video of her estranged husband pulling a large duffel bag.

Tina Adovasio, 40, a nurse from Bronx, New York, vanished from her home on March 11, 2011 after a spat with her estranged husband Edwin Coello, 38, who is now on trial for her murder.

Coello, a former police officer who had several domestic violence claims reported against him by Ms Adovasio, is accused of strangling her and dumping her body in a wooded area.

Her eldest son Joseph, 18, testified yesterday as jurors were shown a surveillance video of Coello taking the large bag out of his car, which looked as if it contained a body.

As the video played, he told the court: 'Eddy is walking out of my house with my mom. It's my mom,' according to the New York Post.

He said that he had heard his mother arguing with Coello over the phone earlier in the day and he later came home to find his mother wasn't there.

Joseph Adovasio also testified that his stepfather urged him to protect an alibi as suspicion grew of his alleged role in her murder.

Joseph testified that Coello told 
him: 'You’re my alibi. You see my car; it hasn’t been moved from that 
spot,' according to the Post.

Ms Adovasio's body was found in a wooded area off the Taconic Parkway - about 40 miles from her home - on March 16, 2011.

It
was another day of damning testimony against Coello, who was fired by 
the NYPD in 2000 after a violent confrontation with an ex-girlfriend.

Last month, texts sent by the murdered wife to Coello were revealed.

Prosecutors say Coello, 41, flew into a violent rage after Ms Adovasio told him in text messages she wanted a divorce because she suspected him of cheating.

In one, she told him that if he wanted to 'live his life as a single guy’ he should 'take his s**t' and get out.

The texts were read at a pre-trial hearing on a defense motion to keep the jury from seeing the confrontational texts.

The
angry missives about Coello’s alleged cheating were retrieved from 
Coello’s phone by Detective John Fennelli shortly after the former 
policeman was arrested at his home, according to the Post.

In one, Coello told his suspicious wife that he was having trouble getting home because of flooded highways.

She replied: 'Do you really think I’m stupid to believe highways are flooded after sun out all day. Really?'

Coello ignored her question and asked, 'R U cooking?'

But Adovasio wrote back: '[I] hope you have money saved for your lawyer cause you’ll need it.

'I only have to make a call and you are so pathetic you think I have no where I could go.'

He replies: 'cooking?'

At
another point, she wrote: 'Tired of you and your disrespectful ways - 
can’t stay in this relationship', according to a transcript Det Fennelli
read in court.

Mystery: Ms Adovasio's beaten and strangled body was found in a wooded area off a quiet New York road

Coello’s lawyer, Renee Hill, asked Judge 
Ralph Fabrizio to throw out the text messages and the testimony of 
former girlfriend Glory Perez, who described the alleged abuse that got 
him fired in 2000.

Coello
originally told police she stormed out of their home after the fight, 
but his alibi unravelled after security video showed him leaving their 
apartment building alone carrying a duffel bag.

After he lost his job as a policeman, Coello became a doorman at a luxury Upper East Side building.

His volatile marriage to Ms Adovasio was marred by several incidents of domestic trouble.

In February 2005, Coello pleaded guilty to second-degree harassment after a domestic incident and received a conditional discharge.

In February 2007, he was arrested for an attack that landed her in a hospital. That case was sealed.

In November 2010, police were called to their home after a fight, but no arrests were made.

Ms Adovasio was the mother of Coello’s six-year-old daughter and had three children from a previous marriage.
