Host commentator

It's all over in Belgrade and Partizan have been well worth their point this evening. Kane smacked the crossbar in the early stages, but that was to be the closest Tottenham would come.

The home side were dangerous on the counter-attack and caused Spurs a few problems without ever seriously testing Lloris.

88mins: Lloris is on course for his fourth clean sheet in seven games here as the game slowsl into a canter.

The crowd are still bouncing up and down but it hasn't quite been enough to sing their side to victory. 

Spurs play the ball around the back before Kane loses an aerial battle. THREE minutes to go. 

Sami Mokbel: Just clocked a worrying banner amongst the Partizan supporters that reads: 'Only Jews and P******' - a play on words on Only Fools and Horses. Surely one for UEFA to look at in the coming days.

85mins: Luka is shown a yellow card after a late challenge on Capoue. The substitute was unlucky as he looked to have won the ball but Capoue's play-acting was enough to convince the referee.  

82mins: Kane fires a tame free-kick into the Partizan wall as Spurs look to gain an advantage in the closing stages.

Salzburg are level and it's thanks to a beautiful free-kick from Soriano. Gordon was left scrambling in his goal as Soriano lifted the strike up and over the wall. 

73mins: Ilic blazes over after the ball falls kindly at the edge of the Tottenham box. If there's going to be a winner in Partizan, it looks likely to be the home side.  

65mins: Lamela has injected a bit of pace into the Spurs attack, but Partizan continue to frustrate the away side.

Lazovic wins a controversial corner after a tackle from Lennon. Pressure on Spurs here. 

The returning skipper has put his side ahead with a 25-yard volley! Unfortunately, it's not quite as wonderful as it sounds as Brown's scuffed strike took a deflection before bobbling in.

But the Celtic fans won't care! 

Petrovic comes on for Volkov as Partizan make the first change of the game. 

52mins: Partizan are starting to put pressure on Spurs during the early stages of the second half. Dricic looks lively and almost puts his side ahead after brilliant work from Pantic on the left. Luckily for Spurs, his shot was tame and Lloris could collect easily.  

48mins: Ben Davies is shown a yellow card for a late tackle on Dricic, but the free-kick comes to nothing as Lloris clears.

We're back underway in Partizan and Salzburg as the two British clubs look to grab their first three points of the season.

Sami Mokbel: Not many positives for Spurs after that first-half. They lacked ideas going forward.

Ben Davies struggled at left back and Andros Townsend picked up a needless booking for dissent. It can only get better for Spurs after that.

The scores are level at half-time as both Tottenham and Celtic are held by Partizan and Salzburg respectively.

Tottenham's best chance came after just three minutes as Kane smashed a left-footed shot against the crossbar.

At the other end, Lloris has been forced into action on several occasions after quick counter-attacks from the Partizan frontline.  

42mins: Tottenham are having lots of controlled possession, but they've been unable to turn that into chances.

Partizan look threatening on the counter-attack and Spurs may be happy to see the half-time break as Lloris saves a shot from Grbic. 

Many eyes will be on Federico Fazio this evening to see if the debutant can help plug gaps in a Tottenham defence that never quite replaced Ledley King.

So far the combination with Jan Vertonghen looks no better or worse than solid, although Fazio was rather fortunate to see Partizan have a chance blocked from point blank range after completely mid-judging a headed clearance.

Andros Townsend has just been booked for dissent, with Pochettino now feeling the need to come to the touchline to overlook his now struggling side.

And it's all square in Salzburg as Alan scores for the home side. The strike took a huge deflection off Celtic's Efe Ambrose. 

34mins: Andros Townsend is shown a yellow card for losing his temper with the linesman after a foul on Volkov.

Moments later, Townsend looks to have led with is elbow as he comes together with Volkov once again. The winger needs to calm down here. 

30mins: The ball bobbles around the Partizan box before the ball drops kindly to Kane. The young striker lines up a left-footed volley, but can only blaze his effort over the bar.

At the other end, Ilic volleys over after an attack along the right leaves Spurs looking a bit light defensively. 0-0!

26mins: Concern for Spurs as Partizan come close to taking the lead before Hugo Lloris pulls off a point blank save to deny Lazovic.

Danny Rose's last trip to Serbia wasn't a pleasant one, and his replacement this evening in Ben Davies is not quite enjoying it neither - albeit for different reasons.

Davies has already given the ball away a couple of times, and Partizan are finding it a little too easy to breach the Spurs back line by attacking the right flank. Tottenham are starting to wobble after a good opening 10 minutes.

21mins: Over in Belgrade, Tottenham have survived one Partizan scare after a good cross from Ilic was cleared to safety.

At the other end, it's been slim pickings for Spurs as Townsend looks lively.  

The Bhoys have the lead thanks to a brilliant left-footed strike from Wakaso.

He found space in the Salzburg penalty area before rifling the ball past the Salzburg goalkeeper. 

10mins: The first 10 minutes are up in in Salzburg and Celtic are putting a bit of pressure on the home team. 

A Commons free-kick results in a Celtic corner before Salzburg manage to clear. Good start for the Bhoys

7mins: Townsend bombs down the right before finding Paulinho who gives the ball away. The crowd are getting right behind their team as the game settles down inside the first 10 minutes. 

3min: Tottenham have their first chance of the game and it's Harry Kane with a strike against the crossbar.

He worked the ball well onto his left foot inside the penalty area before thundering a striker onto the upright.

That certainly would have silenced the crowd early on...

And we're underway in Serbia and Tottenham take kick-off.

The Partizan fans are already creating quite an atmosphere despite the running track between themselves and the pitch.

There's just 150 travelling fans here in Belgrade today, perhaps the potential for supporter clashes has something to do with the lack of numbers.

One Partizan supporter has just whipped out a Scotland flag! It's a big issue where ever you go.

The teams are out as we prepare to get this evening's 6pm kick-offs underway.

Tottenham (all in yellow) step out onto the Partizan pitch as the local fans send a few jeers their way.  

Speaking to ITV4 ahead of kick-off, Pochettino says: 'We have a strong sqaud and I said on the first day that we believe in all of our players. For different reasons some players are in London.

'It's important for the team and this is my first game in the Europa League. We expect a good performance. Getting three points is the most important thing.'

A look back at 1991 from a football perspective conjures up memories which give a stern reminder of just how much football really has moved on.

(Sir) Alex Ferguson still hadn’t won a league title with Manchester United, the class of ’92 were still yet to rip through the youth level of the game and the Premier League didn’t exist.

In addition, an English manager was about to win the top flight title with a now second tier club and even the England team were actually rather good.

Mauricio Pochettino has claimed winning the Europa League is a priority this term, so he's done what any manager looking to back up his claims would do... make 10 changes.

Only Hugo Lloris features from Spurs' 2-2 draw at Sunderland with defender Federico Fazio making his debut, and Benji Stambouli in the team for his first start.

It's a gloriously warm and sunny evening in Belgrade and the PA system in the ground is doing its best to kick the home fans into a frenzy.

Heavy rock music is playing around the ground - but with the capacity yet half full, it's not really having the desired effect.

Spurs vs FK Partizan: Lloris, Naughton, Fazio, Vertonghen, Davies; Bentaleb, Stambouli; Lennon, Paulinho, Townsend; Kane
