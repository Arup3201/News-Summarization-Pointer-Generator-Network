Raheem Sterling admitted he had to Google ‘Ricky Villa’  and ‘Ricky Gervais’ after Brendan Rodgers’s tongue-in-cheek response to his miss against Tottenham on Sunday.

The Liverpool manager claimed Sterling’s ‘run was like Ricky Villa and his finish was like Ricky Gervais’ when he scuffed a chance to score again in the 3-0 demolition of Tottenham.

Sterling said: ‘I had to look him up and when I checked the name I was, “Oh, OK, that’s who it is”. When I was told what he said I didn’t even understand it. But I typed both names in so I know what he meant now.

Confused: Raheem Sterling, speaking on Monday, turned to Google after Brendan Rodgers' post-match quip

‘He’s joked about it and said it was like a baby’s shot. He’s given me a bit of stick for it but my finishing is something I’m improving on and will keep improving on. Hopefully next time I’ll score two.’

Rodgers praised Sterling's performance after he ignited the rout over Spurs with an eight-minute opener before continuing to torment the opposition in the 3-0 win. 

'His tactical awareness is improving, and for a kid of 19 he's been great', said Rodgers. 

'I don't see him as a  10, I think he's flexible. You've seen his flexibility and it was perfect against Spurs.

'It's important he has the intelligence to play these different positions and he's developing that well.

'Him, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson are playing at a leading club and showing really good tactical awareness and energy. 'They're going to do well for Roy Hodgson in the years to come.'
