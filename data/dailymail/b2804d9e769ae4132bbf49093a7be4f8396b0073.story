Along with selfie and twerking, contouring was one of 2014's buzzwords - and it's all thanks to Kim Kardashian.

The selfie-loving beauty buff well and truly put contouring - a laborious method of applying your make-up to enhance your features - on the map.

But is it possible to get Kim's flawless look without a professional make-up artist and hours of brush strokes? FEMAIL was keen to find out.

Get the look: Kim Kardashian achieves that flawless look with a little help of contouring - a laborious method of applying your make-up to enhance your features. As Rodial launch the first-ever make-up range designed specifically for contouring, FEMAIL attempted to emulate their favourite stars 

Rodial - the beauty brand fronted by Daisy Lowe - this year launched the first-ever contouring range of make-up. 

From the £52 illuminating powder to the £34 eye sculpt, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face.

The brand's team of experts are also on hand at the UK's debut sculpting bar in Harvey Nichols, London, to help you create a flawless A-list look.

Ahead of party season, three FEMAIL writers attempted to emulate their favourite contoured celebrities using the innovative new products. So how did they get on? 

Before and after: Caroline McGuire, 30, was a little unnerved at the amount of make-up on her face but she did get quite a few compliments about her appearance from friends who saw her look in party pictures

Caroline McGuire, 30, has never been an avid make-up user; she had never even used a brow pencil before. She loved brand ambassador Daisy Lowe's sculpted look though, so decided to test it out for herself with the help of the sculpting team.

Speaking ahead of her makeover, Caroline said: 'I don't tend to wear a lot of make-up. Daily I use touche eclat, mascara, eye pencil and blusher, then for a party look I just add some bright red lipstick.

'But I was willing to put up with multiple layers of slap if it magically transformed me into Daisy Lowe.'

Also keen to give the product range a run for its money was Luisa Metcalfe, 37.

She said: 'I'm fascinated by the way celebrities like Millie Mackintosh and Kim Kardashian create the illusion of more prominent cheekbones, a straighter nose and bigger eyes through make-up techniques alone. 

'I wear make-up regularly but only  Giorgio Armani BB cream, Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge on my cheeks, L'Oreal mascara and some tinted lip balm.

'With a Christmas party to go to, I was more than willing to give contouring a try - especially if there was a chance it would give me Millie Mackintosh's bone structure for the night.'

Bianca London, 25, already wears a fair amount of make-up so wasn't expecting staggering results.

She was, however, keen to learn how to contour and apply her make-up more naturally, without the dreaded orange face, white neck scenario that her brother so kindly always points out.

The team used their arsenal of products to transform the writers. So how does the range, which comes with big claims, work?

Watch out, Millie Mackintosh! Luisa Metcalfe said she wanted to see if Rodial's contouring make-up could give her the illusion of cheekbones and a bronzed glow, like Millie Mackintosh who favours the brand

The powders are opalescent, which is apparently designed to highlight facial features with an illuminating gleam, and the universal Champagne tone aims to add a candle-lit glow to the skin.

The powders have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently give the skin a silky texture and ensures even application.

The eye products have been made with a mousse-like texture, which, say the makers, can help enhance features as well as be built up to create a more contoured look. 

There's also a £24 tinted cream that is filled with hyaluronic acid, which promises to plump skin. 

Caroline McGuire was impressed, if a little scared of her final look. She said: 'I got a bit of a shock when I looked in the mirror, there was such an extreme amount of make-up on my face and I did actually rub off some of the shading on my cheekbones.

'It was way too much for me to feel comfortable and I was very aware of it throughout the evening, but saying that, about five of my friends got in contact to say how good I looked in Facebook pictures the next day. 

'So it did work - but mainly if you're the kind of person who cares more about what you look like in pictures than in real life.

'It clearly did something though, because looking at my "after" photo, I am posing like a total diva.' 

Luisa was equally impressed. 'I could feel the make-up artist applying a serious amount of product to my face and eyes but I was still surprised to see how bronzed and smoky-eyed I looked in the mirror.

'In the atmospheric lighting at my bash, I received a lot of compliments but under the harsh lights of the ladies' loo, my orange cheeks gave me flashbacks to the "you've been tangoed" ads from the Nineties. 

'However, I loved my eyes and would never have dared to take my make-up so far on my own. Plus in photographs my usually pasty face appeared to have more  colour and definition. No wonder celebrities swear by the stuff on the red carpet.'

Bianca didn't notice a huge difference from her normal daytime look but was impressed by the long-lasting formulations and liked the colour it gave her face. 

Get the look: The powders, as tested by Bianca London, have micronisation technology and fine pearls in the formula, which apparently gives the skin a silky texture and ensures even application

Prep skin with a device such as the Silk’n Reju, which promises to instantly revitalise the skin by boosting the collagen levels, creating a fresh plumped base, for expert contouring.

Gently massage  primer into the skin, this cooling gel will relax and reduce redness, plump the skin and diffuse fine lines, leaving a radiant finish on the skin. This will help protect your skin and hold your make-up.

To even skin tone and add luminosity apply your Rodial Instaglam tint. Buff into the skin using your foundation brush for even, natural and polished coverage.

Take your retouch pen and use to brighten and lift shadow from around the eyes and diffuse fine lines, use the brush to dot straight from the pen into crows' feet, deep frown lines, the folds around the mouth and blend gently with your finger to lift shadow.

Use a highlighter to create instant definition and accentuate features, dot, and blend along the cheekbones to define, the inner corner of the eye to wake up and open the eyes, the brow bone to give an instant brow lift effect and the bridge of the nose and cupids bow to highlight and define.

To create natural structure and sculpt your face shape, simply take your contour brush and Rodial deluxe contour powder, and sweep under the cheekbone to create a natural shadow and strengthen your natural structure, to find exactly where to place this, suck in your cheeks to discover where the natural shadow forms.

Contour down the sides of the nose to slim and under the tip to shorten.

Accentuate cheekbones and add radiance with your an illuminating powder, sweep across the collar bone with your powder brush to define and add a candlelit sheen.

Add a natural sun-kissed warmth to the skin by applying bronzing powder with your powder brush to the forehead, temples, cheekbones, tip of the nose and chest for and even, enhanced glow, add that perfect healthy pinched cheek by gently blending the hyaluronic cheek sculpt gently into the apples of your cheeks.

Define your eyes and brows using the eye sculpt with the eye smudge brush. Sweep it onto the lid and blend with your little finger into your socket line (you can find this by simply opening your eyes and finding the natural crease above the eyeball).

Use the smudge brush to blend it into the bottom lash line - this will give a modern soft smokey effect. 

Create a modern brow by using the smudge brush to buff eye sculpt into the fine hairs of your brows onto the skin beneath, this will naturally define, strengthen and add fullness to your brows.

Finish off with mascara for perfectly defined, fluttery, natural lashes. 

New range: From the eye sculpt to the primer, each of the new products have been designed to contour and sculpt your face
