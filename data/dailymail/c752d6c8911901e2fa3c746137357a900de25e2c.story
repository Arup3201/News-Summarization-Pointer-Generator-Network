When Felice Cohen posted a video online of how she fitted her life into an apartment the size of a walk-in closet, she was an inspiration to penny-pinched tenants across the world.

But now the professional organiser has moved out of the home - where she could not sit up in bed and had to store bananas in her microwave - for an apartment more than five times its size.

Ms Cohen, who is also a writer and artist, had paid just $700 a month for the 90-square foot home in one of New York City's priciest neighbourhoods.

Snug: Felice Cohen, a professional organiser, lived in the 90-square ft apartment in New York for five years

The rent - particularly low cost for its Upper West Side location - meant Cohen could save enough money to move into a 500-ft apartment just around the corner.

In 2010, Ms Cohen posted a video of how she worked with the pokey space, receiving millions of hits from impressed viewers.

The 'microstudio', which was lined with clearly-labelled storage boxes to the ceiling, had no kitchen.

Instead, she relied on a miniature fridge and would use a toaster over and hot pot to cook meals. She also owned just two plates, one fork and one spoon, to save on space.

She climbed a ladder to get into bed,
 where she slept with her face just inches from the ceiling. It was so 
cramped she suffered a panic attack on the first night she slept there.

In her bathroom, which she claimed was 
'pretty big' for the size of the flat, she had to be careful not to bash
 her knees on a cupboard as she sat sideways on the toilet.

By the bathroom door, Ms Cohen stored her clothes behind a curtain, and would regularly fillet the wardrobe to make sure it did not grow beyond the boundaries of its small space.

The 'living room' was little more than a chair by the window with a reading lamp.

Inventive: With no kitchen in the tiny flat, Cohen bought a miniature fridge and stored fruit in the microwave

'I looked at the space like a challenge.
 I knew I could make it work,' Ms Cohen, 42, told the New York Post. 'I 
never felt cramped. I also never thought I’d stay five years.'

Cohen said it was help from her father -
 a bankruptcy lawyer - and her grandfather - who survived the Holocaust -
 that taught her to live frugally.

'How much stuff do we really need? It's less than you
think,' she said.

But she 
needed to look for a new place after her landlord saw the video she had 
made about the tiny space last summer and kicked her out - as she was 
illegally subletting.

Balance: Using the bathroom, which Cohen claimed was 'pretty big', proved to be tricky business

'I didn’t even know it. Now my landlord said he will renovate the space and up the rent to $1,200,' said Cohen, who as a professional organiser has worked for celebrities including Naomi Campbell.

Ms Cohen told MailOnline she had been living with her uncle in
the Bronx, New York when she heard about her old apartment.

'A friend told me that if Michael Jordan stretched his
hands out he could touch both the walls,' she said.

Prime location: Cohen loved the area of the flat, which was just one block from Central Park. She saved so much money on rent she can now afford a 500-square ft apartment in the same neighbourhood

Privilege: Felice paid just $700 a month - but now the landlord is raising this to $1,200 a month

She spent around $1,000 on shelving, the bed and other
storage units to make it as homely and manageable as possible.

Her new apartment is just two blocks away - and friends have joked about how she will cope.

'Everyone is teasing me - what I’m 
going to do with all that space,' she told the Post. 'I’m going to 
bounce off the walls, I guess.'
