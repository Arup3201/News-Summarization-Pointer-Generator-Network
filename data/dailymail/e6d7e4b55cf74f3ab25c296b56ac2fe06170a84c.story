She is the 'happiest kid ever', her mum says. A cheeky bugger who loves to play in the water.

But when some people see little baby Marley, aged sixteen months, they shoot dirty looks at her Brisbane mother and family.

That's because Marley has what appears to be a big, blue bruise on her chest and right arm, leading some strangers to wrongly assume the worst - even abuse - has happened. 

The judgemental attitudes of some strangers have come as a shock to Marley's mum, Simone Johns. 

The blue 'bruising' - which is not a bruise at all, but a 'port wine stain' - is actually caused by an extremely rare and incurable medical condition, known as KTS, or Klippel Trenaunay Syndrome.

'I'm kind of a bit surprised that people jump to that conclusion so quickly,' Ms Johns told Daily Mail Australia. 

'If you see the way I interact with my children I would hope people wouldn't think I was an abusive parent -  by any means - playing in the water with my daughter.

'You wouldn't think we were the family where that happened.' 

An incident at the beach at the weekend has moved Ms Johns to call for greater awareness about Marley's condition.

Ms Johns and her partner were stunned by another family's reaction when they went to frolic in the water at Southbank Beach.

Her partner noticed them staring and whispering, Ms Johns recalled. 'He said, "did you see the way they were looking and Marley and they were talking?"

'He was quite put out by it,' she said. ''As any parent would (be), I was pretty upset about that.' 

'The first thing I thought was, "of course - they're looking at my baby she's cute as".'

But then she realised the dangerous assumptions they were making. 

Marley's disorder affects around one in 100,000 people, according to the U.S. Library of Medicine. 

KTS is so rare in Australia it took months for Ms Johns to find a specialist who could diagnose Marley.

The condition often causes a 'port wine stain', a type of birthmark which Marley has on her chest and right arm, which is caused by bundles of tiny blood vessels near the surface of her skin. 

KTS has also led Marley's arm to swell to twice its size, and while she will be able to live a happy life, she has suffered some complications with her compression suit in the past. 

This weekend's incident drove Ms Johns to take to Facebook with an informative post about Marley and her condition.

'Rather then get upset about people (staring) at her and wondering, why not take the opportunity to raise some awareness,' she wrote, before explaining the condition.

Viral: The response to Simone's Facebook post was overwhelming

She was astonished by the overwhelmingly positive reaction it has received. At last count, it has been shared more than 45,000 times. 

Ms Johns had only ever wanted her message to reach local mums, and she's blown away by how far it her message of acceptance has travelled.

'Everytime I get up in the morning and look at my laptop I say "holy crap!"'

'I can't believe how many people have shared it,' she said. 'It's just gone out of control.' 

Marley and her family are far from alone when it comes to facing unwarranted stigma. 

Blogger and appearance diversity activist Carly Findlay has ichthyosis, a condition which causes her skin to appear red and scaly.  

'I know that when i was little my mum and my dad used to get asked a lot about whether they'd left me out in the sun,' she said.

In July 2013, a Melbourne cab driver told Ms Findlay to get out of his cab and told her 'you smell'. And in December, a photo of hers was ridiculed in a Reddit forum.

Ms Findlay said coming forward and telling her story had been rewarding. 'It's certainly empowered a lot of people to come out and tell their's,' she said.
