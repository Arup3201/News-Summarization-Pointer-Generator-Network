Arsenal want to arrest their defensive midfield worries by landing Cristian Ledesma, according to the player's agent.

The Gunners are known to be short of quality in front of their back four and are said to have deployed scouts to make checks on the Lazio man.

Arsene Wenger is being urged to spend some money next month as Arsenal stumble through another season miles behind Chelsea and Manchester City.

And Ledesma's representative claims they are waiting for an offer.

'It is true, Arsenal are interested in Cristian,' Vincenzo D'Ippolito said. 'There have been scouts [watching], we'll see if there will be an opportunity to examine an offer.'

Whether Arsenal supporters would be placated by a 32-year-old with just one cap for Italy, against Romania in 2010, is another matter.

The Argentine-born spoiler is out of contract in the summer but such are Wenger's injury troubles – Jack Wilshere faces months out with an ankle problem – he could be forced to move sooner should the Gunners feel the need to gamble on an ageing midfielder.
