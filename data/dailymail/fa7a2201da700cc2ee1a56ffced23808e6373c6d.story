David Cameron last night allowed ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech as he struggled to contain a growing Tory mutiny on the issue of Europe.

In an extraordinary development, Downing Street sources said Tory MPs would be given a free vote next week on a backbench amendment to the Speech that expresses ‘regret’ about the lack of legislation for a referendum on Europe.

The move came as senior Tories ignored the Prime Minister’s pleas to pipe down on the issue in the wake of last week’s elections, when UKIP gave the Tories a bloody nose.

Prime Minister David Cameron today took aim at 'pessimists' about his Europe strategy

Speaking in London yesterday, Mr 
Cameron hit out at the ‘pessimists’ in his own party who warn it will be
impossible for him to claw back powers from Brussels and negotiate a 
better deal for Britain in Europe.

He said Tory grandees such as former 
chancellor Nigel Lawson and one-time leadership contender Michael 
Portillo were ‘wrong’ to say Britain should leave the EU now.

Former Tory chancellor Norman Lamont 
also suggested Britain would be better off out, saying the economic 
advantages of EU membership were ‘vastly over-stated’.

Today London Mayor Boris Johnson said it would not be 'cataclysmic' if Britain left the EU.

'We should be prepared to pull out. That goes without saying. You can’t go into a negotiation like that without being willing to walk away,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

'And I don’t think, by the way, that it would be anything like as cataclysmic as is sometimes pretended. I don’t think it would lose millions of jobs, far from it. I think the economic benefits and dis-benefits are now much more balanced.'

But he backed Mr Cameron's renegotiation strategy: 'What we need to do is to say to our friends and partners: "Listen chums this thing isn’t working for either of us. Your eurozone is causing all sorts of misery, plus the on-costs, the none wage costs, the way that the European Union has been running, has legislated, has regulated over the last 20, 30 years are making our continent, making the whole area completely uncompetitive".'

And a third former chancellor, Labour’s Denis Healey said he now believed the ‘case for leaving is stronger than staying in’.

Tory rebels last night revealed they 
had tabled an amendment to the Queen’s Speech criticising the lack of 
legislation to hold an in/out referendum.

Margaret Thatcher changed her view about Britain's EU membership after the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, her biographer claimed

Mr Cameron has told his MPs he is 
unable to bring forward government legislation to enact his pledge to 
hold a referendum in 2017 because of opposition from the LibDems.

But Number 10 last night said he was 
‘relaxed’ about the amendment and suggested Tory MPs and ministers would
be free to vote for it.

If Commons Speaker John Bercow agrees 
to the vote it will be held next Tuesday. Mr Cameron will be on an 
official visit to the US, but other Cabinet ministers are expected to 
vote in what would be a criticism of their own Queen’s Speech and a 
clear sign of dissatisfaction with the Coalition.

The amendment is purely symbolic but 
its supporters claim it will help build an unstoppable momentum for a 
referendum to be held.

Backers include Eurosceptics John Baron, Peter Bone and John Redwood, and maverick Nadine Dorries.

The amendment does not demand 
legislation on a referendum but ‘respectfully regrets’ that no bill was 
included in Wednesday’s Queen’s Speech, which set out the Government’s 
legislative agenda for the coming year.

Mr Baron said its purpose was to send a clear message that the demand for a bill was ‘not going away’.

It underlines the pressure Mr Cameron is facing to sanction backbench legislation on a referendum.

The Prime Minister’s official 
spokesman said he had ‘always said he is very happy to look at all ways 
of strengthening his commitment to an in/out referendum in the next 
Parliament’.

David Cameron is under pressure to bring forward legislation on his promise to stage an EU referendum

Former defence secretary Michael Portillo said he would vote to quit Brussels while London Mayor Boris Johnson, pictured yesterday, argued Britain could survive outside the EU

Yesterday Mr Cameron told a conference
he was right to try to renegotiate Britain’s membership of the EU 
before putting the new deal to a referendum after the next election.

He said: ‘I think it is possible to change and reform this organisation and change and reform Britain’s relationship with it.’

But speaking at the same conference 
later in the day, Mr Johnson, the London Mayor, suggested Britain would 
benefit from leaving the EU.

He said that if Mr Cameron’s bid to renegotiate membership of the EU failed ‘then obviously we should be ready to walk away’.

He said: ‘I think it would be a shot in the arm because people would suddenly feel, yes, we are running our own destiny again.’

Mr Johnson said he was ‘broadly in favour of the single market’ but said its benefits had been overstated.

Lib Dem sources said it would be ‘extraordinary’ for Tory ministers to vote against the Queen’s Speech.

A source said: ‘The Conservatives seem
to want to talk about Europe when we should be talking about the 
positive things in the Queen’s Speech like the reforms on pensions and 
social care.’
