It was a poignant moment, as the Iron Chancellor composed a memorial note for the Iron Lady.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel today signed a book of condolence at the British Embassy in Berlin in memory of Baroness Thatcher, who died on Monday aged 87 after suffering a stroke.

She led many other global politicians such as U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper in paying tribute to Britain’s first and only woman prime minister.

Mrs Merkel, 58, said Lady Thatcher ‘set an example to many after her in that she succeeded as a woman in the highest democratic office at a time when that was not yet a matter of course’.

It came as Mrs Merkel, who became Germany’s first female leader in 2005, invited Prime Minister David Cameron to stay at her residence in Meseburg with his wife Samantha and their children.

‘It is part of the ongoing strong, very good working relationship that the Prime Minister and the German Chancellor have,’ Mr Cameron's official spokesman said of the rare family visit.

Meanwhile details of more than 2,000 guests being invited to Lady Thatcher's funeral were issued today - including all her surviving former Cabinet ministers and Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson.

Fresh information about the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral in central London was released as Lady Thatcher's old political adversary Lord Kinnock revealed he would not be attending.

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev said his health problems will keep him away and Argentina's president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was left off the list after her provocative comments about the Falklands.

Number 10 said the guest roster had been drawn up by Lady Thatcher's family and representatives with the assistance of the Government and the Conservative Party.

Confirmed guests so far include Sir John Major, Tony and Cherie Blair, Gordon Brown, Canadian Mr Harper, former South Africa leader FW de Klerk, and novelist Lord Jeffrey Archer.

Singer Dame Shirley Bassey and broadcaster Sir Terry Wogan are also due to attend the service, which will begin at 11am after Lady Thatcher's body has been transported from Parliament.
