The wedding dress of singer Amy Winehouse, which was about to be auctioned for charity, has been 'stolen to order' in a raid on the London home where she was found dead.

She wore it to marry Blake Fielder-Civil in a ceremony in Miami, Florida, while an iconic newsprint cocktail dress from the peak of her fame was also taken.

The wedding dress alone was expected to raise in excess of £100,000 for her foundation, which helps youngsters beat drugs and develop their music.

Taken: This newsprint dress worn by Amy on Later With Jools Hollands was stolen along with her wedding dress - worth at least £130,000 in total

Experts believed the newsprint dress, worn on the BBC live music show Later With Jools Holland, would also have secured at least £30,000.

The dresses were stolen from the performer’s Camden home in north London but it is not believed the property was broken into.

They were to be sold in New York later this year.

Couple: Amy married Blake in 2007 but two years later he sought a divorce

Her father Mitch told The Sun: 'It's a blow', adding 'It's sickening to know that someone would steal something in the knowledge of its sentimental value.

'Her wedding dress was only a little cotton thing thing, a hundred quid at best in the shops. Whoever nicked it realised its significance and knew it had an extra value.'

He added that the house, worth around £3million, is being sold and all her possessions logged and put into storage, which is how they realised it had gone.

Theft: The two dresses were taken from Winehouse's home in London, which became a shrine after her death last year

Thousands came to Camden to pay their respects, in some cases even leaving alcohol as a tribute

Inspiration: Despite problems in her private life Amy Winehouse was considered one of the great singers of recent times

Tributes: Mourners gather outside Amy's flat in Camden to pay their respects after her death in July 2011

Because of the items’ significance, it is thought they might have been stolen to order by someone entering the property during events after her death in July last year.

A spokesman for her Foundation said: 'A lot of clothes and items were left and they were being catalogued when it was realised these two were missing.

'They were going to go to the foundation but somebody might be trying to sell them for their own profit.

'People need to know they are not supposed to be out there on the market and they should not try to buy them.

Saddened: Amy Winehouse's father Mitch (pictured at her funeral) says he has been left sickened by the thefts

'The dress Amy wore on the cover of Back To Black sold for £40,000 last year and the money went to the foundation, and another dress sold for £30,000 so the wedding dress could have raised as much as £100,000.

'Both the stolen dresses are part of Amy’s story.'

Scotland Yard has not received a formal complaint but it is thought the star’s father Mitch Winehouse has been speaking with a family liaison officer the Metropolitan Police gave them after his daughter’s death, which stunned the music world.

Amy Winehouse drank herself to death 
only hours after saying she was desperate to live because she still had 
so much to achieve, her inquest was told.

The
singer drank enough to stop her breathing and send her into a coma. 
Three empty vodka bottles were found near her body in her bedroom.

A
pathologist who examined her said she had 416mg of alcohol per 
decilitre of blood – five times the legal drink-drive limit of 80mg. The
inquest heard that 350mg was usually considered a fatal amount.

Miss Winehouse won five Grammy awards
for her 2006 hit album Back To Black. But she became as well-known for 
her battle with alcohol and drugs as for her singing.

She was found dead in Camden, North London, on July 23 last year.

Traces
of the alcohol withdrawal drug Librium were found in her body. But 
there were no illegal drugs and her doctor said she had beaten her drug 
addiction in 2008.

The inquest heard she had quit alcohol for three weeks last July but began drinking again three days before her death.

Her doctor said the star made ‘tremendous efforts’ to beat her drink 
problem and often gave up for weeks at a time before lapsing back into 
drinking.
