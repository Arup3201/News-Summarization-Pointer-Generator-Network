Jessa Duggar, the 21-year-old star of TLC's 19 Kids and Counting, has sparked a social media storm after she was snapped posing boldly with a pink-trimmed high-capacity semi-automatic assault rifle.

The photo was posted on Facebook by Jessa's boyfriend, 19-year-old Ben Seewald; a staunch Christian conservative who is highly vocal about his support for guns and his commendation of abortion.

'My AWESOME girlfriend. #DontmesswithJessa', reads the caption.

The photo seems to have been taken in a gun store, and has attracted a predictable wash of debate, with users taking to the comments section to vent their views.

'Isn't that the kind of guns they give soldiers who are at war? No wars going on in North America. People who think it's okay to keep weapons like this in their homes scare me', wrote one user.

'Brain washed fools. I'm glad she knows how to defend herself...Btw, if you wait for the police to defend you, you will die waiting. I on the other hand will lock and load', wrote another.

One commenter posed the frank question: 'Wow, would Jesus carry that weapon?'

To which another responded with a specific reference to the Bible: 'Jesus would carry that, were he walking among us today. He exhorts his followers to buy the best personal defense weapon of the day, the sword, even if they had to sell their only cloak to get one. Luke 22:36.'

Strong views: Ben is a strict conservative Christian who stands firmly behind the Second Amendment, which allows for gun ownership, and staunchly against abortion

It isn't the first time the Duggar family have come under fire for their gun-related antics.

In 2011, 23-year-old John David Duggar, the family's third eldest sibling, was photographed posing with two large rifles hugged to his chest, along with his exchange student friend, before heading out to target practice.

'We believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives'

In response to the backlash, the Duggars stressed that gun safety was a top priority in their house. Guns are kept in a safe that can only be accessed by a few family members, they claim, and everyone who handles the guns has taken gun safety classes.

'We believe it is important for children to learn safety about guns and knives. To learn how to use them properly and to learn not to use them to hurt others but to use them as a tool', Jim Bob Duggar, the 48-year-old family patriarch told Radar Online.

been vocal with their views about gun ownership, with Jim Bob (left) once 
saying, 'It’s really not the gun or the knife, it’s the person that has 
it in their hands'

Jim Bob has also likened guns to knives in the past, saying: 'We’ve all used knives to cut a steak or open a box. It’s really not the gun or the knife, it’s the person that has it in their hands.'

'Jesus is EVERYTHING to me. Without Him, I am nothing'

Since posting the controversial photo of his rifle-welding sweetheart, Ben - whose Facebook profile summary reads: 'Jesus is EVERYTHING to me. Without Him, I am nothing' -  has been busy sharing a series of loved up photos of himself and Jessa, with captions including: 'Love you, Babe!' and, 'Spending the day with my Sweetheart!'

Also appearing are several of Ben's commonly dropped pro-life references, such as: 'Abortion is a matter of life and death. We must abolish abortion!'

According to the Duggar family's views on dating, Jessa and Ben are just 'courting' for now, which means they refrain from kissing or holding hands and always have a chaperone on dates.

The Duggars, from Tontitown, Arkansas, see courting as a couple deciding whether marriage is appropriate while in a group setting with both of their families.

Only once they have committed to their engagement are they permitted to hold hands for the first time, but they will have to wait until their wedding day before sharing their first kiss.

Marriage on the cards? Jessa recently launched official Instagram and Twitter accounts in which she takes on Ben's last name, identifying herself as 'Jessa Seewald'

Last month, the couple went on a double date with Ben's parents, and Jessa spoke to Ben's father about her initial feelings for his son.

'I noticed him right off. I was like,  "Hmm, he seems like a nice guy," but I never really consider a guy unless he's approached my dad', she said.

'Definitely in the early stages of our friendship, I thought he was a great guy,' she continued.

'But I'm that type of person that I'm not going to get emotional or like daydream about [a guy] unless he really expresses his interest. I'm not gonna set my expectations on anything happening.'

Although an official engagement hasn't yet been announced, two weeks ago, Jessa opened official Instagram and Twitter accounts with the name 'Jessa Seewald' - the pair's biggest hint yet that marriage may be just around the corner.

The Duggar family are considered representative of the Quiverfull movement which teaches that 'children are God’s blessing and that husbands and wives should happily welcome every child they are given.'

Addressing their critics, Jim Bob once said: 'People think we are overpopulating the world [but] we are following our convictions.'
