A multiple sclerosis patient says police repeatedly asked her is she was a drug addict and a prostitute after she reported being raped last year.

The alleged victim, who wishes only to be identified as Kris, told NBC New York that she fell asleep on a bus December 5 and missed her stop - ending up in Trenton, New Jersey. 

She was trying to find a bus back to Hamilton when she noticed a man following her and then everything went black.

Slow going: An alleged rape victim in New Jersey says it took police more than two weeks to formally interview her about the attack that happened December 5. She identified herself as 'Kris' to NBC New York

Scene of the crime: Kris says she was raped on a mattress on the floor of this abandoned home in Trenton after falling asleep on a bus and missing her stop

The next thing Kris remembers is waking up in a home on Farragut Ave, lying on a mattress on the floor while two men raped her.

Kris says one of the men was extremely violent, hitting her in the face multiple times while covering her mouth.

Eventually the two men fled and Kris was able to escape the house where she tried to flag down people on the street for help - to no avail.

'Three or four people I first saw, and they wouldn’t give me the time of day,' Kris told NBC. 'And then I saw four people across the street and … they told me to go away."

She had to walk more than a mile before she was able to find help at Mario and Frank's Pizzeria, where owner Frank Colella found her shaking, crying and bleeding.

'It was a mess,' he said.

Staff at the restaurant called 911 and Kris was next taken to Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in Hamilton.

At the hospital, a nurse performed a rape kit on her and police detective conducted a preliminary interview.

But just a few hours later, the staff dispatched her and told her to go see an oral surgeon.

Kris mother Denise is not satisfied with the medical care her daughter received at RWJ.

'This wasn’t just a cut on her hand or a sprain of her ankle. She had five fractures of her face,' Desnise said. 'It’s wrong. It’s totally wrong. If it was their family member they would not have sent her home.'

Kris was later taken to a hospital in Neptune where she underwent multiple surgeries to repair her jaw.

A spokesperson for the hospital says they are investigating the incident.

'RWJH has a solid reputation for quality health care and patient comfort. And, although we may differ on any claims made, we believe that no patient should have such a negative view of their care at RWJUHH,' the hospital said.

'That is why we have undertaken a thorough review of the facts and continue to reach out to this patient to confidentially discuss those concerns.'

Meanwhile, it wasn't until December 23 that police concocted their first formal interview with Kris about the rape.

During the interview, Kris says a Trenton detective and Mercer County Prosecutor kept asking her if she was a prostitute or a drug addict, despite not having any criminal history involving solicitation or possession.

'When he asked his partner if there was one question they would like to ask, the one and only question he could come up with, out of everything in the book, was: "Did you voluntarily pull down the man’s pants before he raped you?"' said Kris.

She described the detectives as 'hostile' and says they treated the interview like 'it was a big joke and a waste of time'.

'They tag-teamed,' said Kris. '"Was I out there soliciting? Was I out there buying drugs? Why did I get off the bus at that spot?"'

She is being prescribed a pain patch for an injury sustained in a multiple sclerosis-related seizure, but the detectives were suspicious the prescription is legitimate.

'"You sure about her MS?" That’s all they kept asking me," said Kris' mother. '"Are you sure she didn’t fall and this isn’t MS?" They wanted to turn everything around, make her the victim all over again, and it was crap. Plain and simple crap. They didn’t want to do their job.'

Both the Trenton Police and Mercer County deny Kris and her family's claims of mistreatment.

In a separate statement Mercer Court Prosecutor Joseph Bocchine says it was the family that delayed the interview and that they tried multiple times to talk to Kris and were rebuffed until December 23 - which her family denies.

Kris' mother also questions why the rape kit wasn't sent out for testing until Jan 2 - a month after the attack. DNA results are still not in on the kit.
