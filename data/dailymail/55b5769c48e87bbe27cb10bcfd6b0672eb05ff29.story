Growing pains: Splash TV presenter Gabby Logan has revealed she suffered body 'angst' when she was a teenager

Gabby Logan has revealed she suffered body ‘angst’ when she was a teenager and that she now worries her daughter could go through the same. 

Yesterday the Splash! TV presenter admitted she and her husband worry that Lois, who is eight, could develop body image issues as she grows up.

It is a concern that may stem from her own experiences of her changing body when she was at the peak of her sporting career.

Mrs Logan represented Wales in rhythmic gymnastics but was forced to retire from the sport aged 17 due to sciatica.

She kept a diary during her teenage years and admitted that she wrote about feeling uncomfortable with her changing body once she hit puberty.

Mrs Logan, 40, who co-presented Olympics 2012 for the BBC alongside Clare Balding, made her comments in a wide-ranging interview in which she spoke about the importance of healthy eating in her family and being able to recognise hunger.

Opening up about her family’s lifestyle, and her daughter, who appears to have inherited her mother’s sporty genes and is a keen gymnast and swimmer,  Mrs Logan, 40, said: ’I would never want my daughter to think she had to eat less of something.

'We talk about over eating, about how that’s not good, to eat more than you need to.

‘But at the same time you can give those messages without it being about body image, it’s about health again. It all comes back to health as opposed to being svelte or fitting into your jeans.’

The presenter went on to talk about a diary she kept as a child, in which wrote fearfully about her developing body.

Mrs Logan, who is married to Kenny, 41, said: ‘I was always aware, when you do gymnastics you’re always in a leotard – you can’t be any more, the next thing is being naked.

'And so you’re very aware of your body
 so when I hit puberty I didn’t want to change. I wanted to stay a 
little girl’s body, I didn’t want to become a woman, it didn’t feel that
 it was right.

‘So at first
 I wasn’t really embracing the changes, and thinking “oh no, I want to 
keep looking like this”. And I don’t know why I worried, I was never 
going to get big boobs, and I was never going to be that curvy, nobody 
in my family is really.

'But even the tiniest changes when 
you’re 12 or 13 make a big difference. And the irony was a few of my 
friends were really curvy and all the boys thought they were great.

'Boys didn’t like me, but I didn’t care, I was like “I want to go and do gymnastics, I’m not bothered about that”.

‘So
 I remember feeling, in fact I found some old diaries full of angst – 
and that’s somebody who had a healthy attitude towards their body.

'But
 obviously it’s a common issue with most young girls. You’ve got to 
empower them with something that makes them see their body as something 
other than a portal for clothes or looking good for boys.’

Like any family, perhaps, the Logans have some health issues in their history.

Mrs
 Logan’s brother, Daniel, collapsed and died aged 15 from what was later
 discovered to be congenital heart disease, while Mr Logan’s mother, 
Elizabeth, was a Coeliac, which led to Mr Logan cutting out wheat from 
his diet.

But Mrs Logan, who has joined a Tesco healthy eating campaign called Eat Happy, insisted they are not ‘faddy’ about food.

She said: ‘Kenny and I aren’t faddy at all, apart from Kenny’s mum’s a coeliac so Kenny doesn’t eat wheat.

'So
 we have a lot of wheat-free food in the house, which doesn’t really 
affect anything because I’m not really prone to throwing loads of flour 
into sauces or anything like that.’

She added: ‘And we don’t eat very much red meat, we try and limit it to a couple of times a month.’

But
 while Mrs Logan dishes out large portions to her former Scottish rugby 
player husband and their twins, Lois and Reuben, her own plateful will 
be smaller.

Despite doing a 
gym session or yoga class four or five times a week, she has days when 
she eats very little. And she admitted her diet is similar to the 5:2 
fast, which sees followers eat just 500 calories two days a week.

‘I’ve
 always done that in the sense that if I have a really big day – I’ve 
gone to a lunch, say, and then I’ve had to go to a dinner – the next day
 I probably don’t feel as hungry, so subconsciously I don’t eat so much.

'That seems to make sense to me. You don’t feel as hungry if you’ve eaten loads.’

She added: ‘As you get older you definitely notice it and your metabolism gets slower and you just don’t eat as big a portion.

'If you don’t ever feel hungry, that’s probably not right, if you don’t ever feel that sense of [hunger] which I don’t know if we do in the western world anymore.’

The Tesco campaign, which Mrs Logan is a part of, involves allowing primary school children to visit farms and food sources.

It is a long term programme that aims to cut levels of obesity in the UK. And speaking of her reasons for becoming involved, she said: ‘I get really frustrated when I drive along and see a 12 year old boy who is stuffing his face with really unhealthy fast food and is clearly overweight.

‘That problem is not going to get any better unless someone intervenes and helps that child understand what that food’s doing to him.’
