Manquillo, who is only 20, was released by Real Madrid at 14 but has since represented Spain at every youth level between Under 16 and Under 20.

He became part of Atleti's youth set-up after leaving Real and established himself as the club's second choice right-back behind Juanfran last season, despite making only three La Liga appearances.

Manquillo, who has become Liverpool's seventh summer signing, told Liverpoolfc.com: 'I'm very happy to have signed for a club like Liverpool. I think it's one of the biggest in Europe. Any footballer would want to come and play here.

'When they tell you Liverpool want to sign you, I think like any player, you are going to be absolutely amazed and you don't think of anything else than going straight there.

'It's a team that nowadays, as I said before, any player would want to be a part of.'

Arsenal, as well as other clubs from around Europe, were interested in Manquillo but he opted for a temporary switch to Anfield.

Barcelona had considered including Manquillo in their negotiations  with Atletico over David Villa last summer, but a deal could not be found.
