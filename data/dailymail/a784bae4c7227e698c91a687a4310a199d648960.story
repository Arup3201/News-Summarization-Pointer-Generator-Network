When two prisoners decided to stage a rooftop protest on a hot day, it was only a matter of time before health and safety became an issue.

Sure enough, staff at Dartmoor prison in Devon soon became concerned about the men’s welfare... and offered them suncream.

The Ministry of Justice said the offer was part of its duty of care, but Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright condemned it as ‘promoting foolishness’, and John Hancock, of the Prison Officers’ Association, said it was ‘absolutely ludicrous’.

Outrage: Staff at HMP Dartmoor in Devon have been blasted for offering prisoners sun cream after they climbed on to a roof during last week's heatwave. The Ministry of Justice defended the move as 'a duty of care'

The incident was eventually resolved by negotiation between the convicts and the wardens at the prison which as built to hold French and American prisoners of war in 1809. It now houses 659 inmates

Mr Hancock said: ‘They shouldn’t have been up there in the first place.

'In
 next two or three weeks, when we hit the hotter part of the summer, it 
is only going to encourage other inmates to get up there on the roofs 
and expect suncream and sun block – and possibly cold drinks and ice 
creams.

‘It is absolutely ludicrous that inmates are being molly-coddled. I have been in the service 28 years and in my day we would have gone on the roof and used hose pipes to squirt the prisoners with water.

‘It is absolute madness. They would have soon come down when the sun went in and it started getting cold.’

The pair sneaked up to the sun spot at 
HMP Dartmoor in Devon for eight hours during last week's heatwave when 
temperatures topped 24C in some places. The two men declined the suncream.

Peter McParlin, the National Chairman
 of the Prison Officers' Association said: 'I imagine the officers gave 
the sun cream on instruction from managers.'

He added: 'There's been a spike in incidents at height - part of that is the reduction in staff.

'The supervision isn't there to the extent it has in the past.'

Safety first: The Ministry of Justice has now launched a review into the suncream incident on June 19

Defending the situation, the Ministry 
of Justice (MoJ) said the offer of sun lotion was a means of negotiation
 to get the prisoners to come down from what appeared to be a protest.

An inquiry has now been launched into the incident.

It is not clear how the inmates managed to get on to the roof or which building on the site in Princetown was involved - but sources described it as an incident 'at height'.

Prisons Minister Jeremy Wright said: 'This should not have happened.

'There should be no policies in place 
which promote this kind of foolishness and I have ordered an immediate 
review of this incident to ensure that it does not happen again.'

The incident was mocked on social media. Commenting on Facebook Stephanie Harrison said: 'Sheer stupidity.

'They decided to get up there so they must face the consequences...and if it means sun burn then so be it! Why pander to them as next they will be wanting iced drinks and a sun shade!!'

Ashley Holman said: 'Not sure if Dartmoor prison offer deck chairs to their residents. Next they will be offering hats shorts and sandals.'

Dartmoor prison, which is currently 
able to hold 659 inmates, was originally built to hold French and 
American prisoners of war in 1809.

Owned
 by the Duchy of Cornwall, it is a Category C prison - for convicts who 
are not trusted in open spaces but are deemed unlikely to escape.

Notable
 former convicts include the 'acid bath murderer' John Haigh and Frank 
Mitchell, the 'Mad Axeman' employed by the Kray twins.

An MoJ spokeswoman said: 'On Thursday 19 June, there was an incident at height at HMP Dartmoor involving two prisoners.

'The incident was successfully resolved by negotiation at 4.28pm. No staff or prisoners were injured.'
