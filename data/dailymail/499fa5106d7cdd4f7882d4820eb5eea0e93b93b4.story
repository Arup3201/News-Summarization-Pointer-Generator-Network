A pensioner on social security who accidentally sent her rent check addressed to her landlord to Comcast found the company had cashed it when she asked for it back.

Francis Wilson from Albuquerque, New Mexico unwittingly put her $235 rent check for her landlord in an envelope along with her $20 Comcast subscription payment and accidentally sent it off to the company.

But when she realised her mistake and asked for it back, the Comcast admitted that they had already cashed the check and said they would only pay it back by putting credit on her account.

Francis Wilson, 79, who discovered that she accidentally sent her $235 rent check addressed to her landlord to Comcast and the company then cashed it when she asked for it back 

The 79-year-old, who needed the cash back to pay her landlord, begged Comcast to give her the money back but each time they refused her the refund.

She told KRQR-TV: 'At first I couldn't think in my mind, where did I send the check? I just couldn't imagine that it was Comcast.

'They didn't even call me and tell me I had made the mistake. Who gave them the authority to cash the check?'

It was only when Mrs Wilson called the local media to tell them of her story that Comcast relented and evetually gave her the money.

As well as reimbursing the money, they also gave her $235 in cash and kept the $235 credit on her Comcast account.

After asking Comcast to reimburse the check the cashed, pictured, the company refused and saying they could only credit her account 

A spokeswoman from the firm explained that the check had been cashed as they use an automated payments system and nobody had personally handled the payment.

She also added that as soon as the mistake was brought to their attention they quickly apologised and offered to pay her back.

But Mrs Wilson added: 'It took a long time for this, it wasn't overnight.'

Last week, Comcast also came under fire after it emerged an Illinois woman was sent a bill from the company addressed to 'Super Bi***'

Mary Bauer said she had been battling with the company since last April, calling 'hundreds of times' as she tried to get them to restore the Hallmark Channel to her line-up.

It was only when Mrs Wilson called the local media that Comcast relented and agreed to pay her the money back

Meanwhile another couple were sent a bill addressed to 'A**hole Brown' after they tried to cancel their subscription.

Lisa and Ricardo Brown from Spokane Washington said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties.

But Mrs Brown said the customer service representative transferred her to a retention specialist who attempted to persuade her to keep the cable and sign a new two-year contract.

When the couple received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.'

In both cases Comcast were forced to apologise and said an internal investigation was underway.
