Punishment: Billi Jo Smallwood, 39, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for setting fire to her home which killed two of her children in 2007

A sobbing mother was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for setting fire to her home in Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and killing two of her children in what prosecutors described was a scheme to kill her husband and collect on his life insurance policy.

In a tearful plea for leniency, 39-year-old Billi Jo Smallwood showed photo albums and her son's toy chest while professing her innocence to a crime that could have put her in prison for the rest of her life.

‘Those are my children, my babies that grew inside of me,’ she told U.S. District Judge Thomas B. Russell. ‘I love them so much.’

Family, friends and even her jail guards portrayed her as caring, selfless and deeply religious during nearly an hour of testimonials in support of Smallwood, who wept during many of the presentations.

Assistant U.S. Attorney James R. Lesousky Jr. described Smallwood's actions as ‘premeditated and devious’ that justified a life sentence.

‘She turned her back on those children, and when she did so, she lost two of them,’ he said.

Smallwood was convicted by a federal jury in June of maliciously setting fire to the two-story housing unit in 2007 while her children slept inside. Prosecutors argued her intent was to kill her husband and cash in his $400,000 insurance policy.

Plea: During the hearing, Smallwood sobbed as she showed photos of her slain children, son Sam Fagan, left, and daughter Rebekah, right, telling the judge that she loves them and asking for leniency

She was convicted of one count of malicious damage and destruction by fire to property owned by the United States.

The blaze killed nine-year-old Sam Fagan and two-year-old Rebekah Smallwood.

Smallwood's husband, Wayne, a soldier serving at Fort Campbell at the time, and their young daughter escaped unharmed.

Russell mentioned the ‘powerful and sincere’ remarks by Smallwood's defenders while handing down the sentence. Russell also ordered Smallwood to pay $209,000 in restitution for damage caused by the blaze.

Evidence presented at trial indicated she purchased a gasoline can about 12 hours before the fire was set. Remnants of the container were found by investigators in the first-floor dining room, where gasoline had been poured and ignited.

Testimonials: Family, friends and even her jail guards spoke in support of Smallwood, describing her as caring, selfless and deeply religious

During her trial Matthew Cummings, a special agent with U.S. Army Criminal Investigations Division testified that Smallwood suffered second- and third-degree burns, but they were consistent with someone who set a fire. He said doors in the home had been locked from the inside and smoke detectors had been removed.

Mr Cummings said the husband had a $400,000 life insurance policy and the investigation showed the couple's relationship was 'rocky' and she was 'concerned with his abuse of alcohol and drugs.'

Wife and mother: Smallwood talked of being thrilled when she found out she was pregnant with her oldest child and of her devotion to her husband

Just before the fire was set, the couple had returned from a trip to Georgia and had only $17, the agent said. She was aggravated that her husband had gone out earlier in the evening to a VFW club bar.

Previous records of Mr Smallwood abusing his wife were brought up during her trial, with him released from a county jail on a domestic abuse complaint by his wife just before her bail hearing in 2008.

Prosecutors also pointed to evidence showing Smallwood fabricated her claim that she received a threatening phone call meant for her husband on the eve of the fire. Her intent, they said, was to divert attention from herself as a suspect.

‘The telephone call never happened,’ Lesousky said Thursday. ‘It was part of her cover up.’

Smallwood said she wasn't the person portrayed by prosecutors.

She talked of her devotion to her husband and of being thrilled when she found out she was pregnant with her oldest child. She talked about the children in personal terms while describing scrapbook photos.

Her mother and her aunt offered tearful statements asking for leniency.

Home Team: Mr Smallwood came to his wife's defense early in the trial, dismissing allegations that she had plotted to kill him as 'absurd'

Brenda Napper, a sergeant at the Marion County Detention Center, where Smallwood has been held, said she believes Smallwood's claim of innocence. Napper said it's the first time she's ever felt an inmate was innocent.

Mitchell Embry, a volunteer chaplain who has gotten to know Smallwood during her incarceration, called her ‘the most faithful, deep-thinking, spiritual person I've been around.’

Defense attorney Laura Wyrosdick declined to say whether Smallwood will appeal.

Smallwood's trial had been delayed several times over evidentiary issues and appeals.
