Cult TV show Dallas has sparked an 80's fashion revival, according to sales figures released today by high street retailer Debenhams.

But put thoughts of neon leggings and denim jackets out of your mind: the character driving the trend is matriarch Sue Ellen Ewing, played by 71-year-old actress Linda Gray.

Sales of tailored dresses and jackets 
similar to those worn by the actress have more than doubled since Sue 
Ellen first appeared on the Channel 5 show, according to 
Debenhams.

The impact of the return of the hit 80's
 show - only weeks old - has already been felt on the high street and 
been dubbed the 'Dallas Effect'.

Best sellers include a £75 J by Jasper Conran tartan shift dress and £65 J by Jasper Conran jacket.

Other items to register a surge in sales are evening dresses from the Designers at Debenhams ranges in bold metallics and velvet - none of which would look out of place at the TV hit show’s Oil Baron’s Ball.

Also popular are glamorous 80’s trouser suits and pointy toe stiletto heels, which shoppers are buying instead of last season's chunky platform sandals.

'Power dressing is back,' says Debenhams spokeswoman Michelle Dowdall. 'Women want to look a million dollars and are going all out to make an impression by heading straight for the tried and tested power-dressing tools made famous by the notorious Texans.'

80's staples, including power suits, bold print and towering stiletto heels, all featured on the winter catwalks, while last season's delicate ladylike pieces kickstarted the current trend for matching shoes and bags - another 80's classic.

Prada showed brightly printed tunic and trouser combos, while at Chanel, the three piece suit was given a revamp for A/W2012.

Miu Miu, Erdem, Prabal Gurung and Roberto Cavalli also showed trouser suits, while on the high street, Debenhams, Whistles and Topshop all offer a cheaper take on the trend.

Along with clothes, accessories have also taken a step back in time, with Debenhams reporting a significant rise in sales of costume jewellery, with big crystals and pearls selling well.

Adds Dowdall; 'Customers are piling on the bling and splashing out on all sorts of costume jewellery to make a big 80’s style statement

'It’s as though Dallas reminds people of a time when the economic outlook was bold and bright – just like the cast’s wardrobe!'
