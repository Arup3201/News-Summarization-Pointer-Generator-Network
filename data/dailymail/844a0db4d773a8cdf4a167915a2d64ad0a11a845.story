A devoted daughter beat her 93-year-old mother to death when she could no longer cope with caring for her, a court heard.

Susan Potts, 64,  battered grandmother Gladys Allen's face and head with a heavy purple glass vase at least 30 times at her home in Sheffield.

Potts, of Uxbridge, Middlesex, has now pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Sheffield Crown Court. 

She was handed an indefinite hospital order during yesterday's court hearing and will be treated at St Bernard's secure hospital unit in Southall, London.

During the case, the court heard how the mother of two had temporarily left her home in Middlesex in January to go and stay with her mother in Sheffield after she came out of hospital following a fall. 

But within weeks Potts, who had suffered from severe depression for decades, found the cooking, cleaning and toilet duties too much.

She agonised over putting her mother into private care and felt she was letting her down, even vetting 14 different care agencies before choosing one.

Just a week before carers were due to take over, when she and her husband intended to move back to Middlesex, she 'snapped', the court heard.

Michael Slater, prosecuting, told the court: 'She was finding it increasingly difficult to cope with providing care for her mother on a daily basis.

'Some of her friends and family including her husband thought she was stretched to breaking point by her responsibilities.

'It is not suggested she cared for her mother in anything other than an exemplary way. She was the main if not the exclusive carer.'

Mrs Allen, a widow who lived with her 33-year-old grandson Jonathan, one of Potts' sons, had been due to go the hairdressers on the day she died but Potts was worried about her possible incontinence on the way.

Potts woke her husband Robin, who had been staying with her in Sheffield, at 8.45am on January 22 to tell him what she had done.

She told him: 'Something terrible has happened in the dining room, go downstairs and check. I think I have killed mum.'

He found seven-stone Mrs Allen in her blood-stained nightdress on the floor at the side of her bed, which was in the dining room.

Potts said she had dreamed of suffocating her mother with a tea towel during the night and could no longer distinguish reality.

Mr Slater said: 'When the police arrived, she admitted to an officer that she had killed her mother and expressed disbelief and said caring for her mother had just become too much.'

She said later she had told her husband: 'I don't know whether it is a dream but I might have killed mum.'

A pathologist found Mrs Allen had a range of injuries, including  head wounds, multiple rib fractures and injuries to her hands where she had tried to fight off her daughter.

Mr Slater added: 'He was satisfied she had been subject to a sustained and forceful assault using more than one method of inflicting injury.'

Potts denied murder but admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

She was flanked by four hospital staff and two security guards as she observed the proceedings intently without showing any emotion in the dock.

Alwyn Jones, defending, said psychiatrists concluded she was suffering from a recurrent depressive disorder at the time. It impaired her ability to form rational judgement and caused her to lack a degree of self-control.

'Her depression, personality traits and the circumstances formed a cocktail which led to the loss of Mrs Allen's life,' he said.

'There is no evidence she would have sought to harm her mother without the depressive illness.'

He said it was 'abundantly clear' that Potts was 'driven in her desire' to care for her mother.

'She had a caring nature and did her level best to look after her mother,' he said.

Family and friends spoke highly of Potts who 'changed things around' at her mother's home for the pensioner's comfort. One said: 'She is a very caring, kind and loving person.'

The court heard Potts had been left 'devastated' by what had happened and was receiving treatment at the secure hospital unit at St Bernard's in London.

Judge Julian Goose made both a hospital order and a restriction order under the Mental Health Act which means Potts will continue to receive treatment at the unit until doctors decide she is fit to be released.

Making the restriction order, he said: 'The attack was of such violence that I cannot conclude there is no future risk to members of the public.'

The court heard how Potts attacked her mother after becoming overwhelmed with caring for her at her house in Sheffield (pictured). She woke up her husband on January 22 and told him: 'I think I have killed mum'

After the hearing Potts' family said in a statement that she was a 'caring and loving daughter' who felt 'regret and sadness' at the death of her mother.

They said: 'Gladys was a central focus for our family and loved and respected by us all.

'Susan was a caring and loving daughter, thoughtful and attentive to her mother's needs. Her only desire was that her mother should live out the rest of her life in happy independence, doing what she had always enjoyed doing.

'The tragedy that occurred was because at that time Sue had become severely depressed, it would have been unthinkable in any other circumstances.

'Her mother was central to everything she did and the manner of her passing fills her with regret and sadness.

'It is the continuing generous support of friends and family which is helping us come to terms with these tragic events and we extend our thanks to them all.

'We are grateful that the justice system has recognised, that, but for her mental state, this tragedy would not have occurred, and that Sue will continue to receive treatment in hospital.

'The hope for all of us, including Gladys' friends and neighbours, is that with expert care, Sue will recover and eventually return to her family.'

Detective Inspector Ian Fidler, the officer leading the case, said: 'This has been a difficult investigation of the most sensitive nature, because of the familial relationship between the victim and the defendant and a highly emotive case for all involved.

'Mrs Allen's death was tragic and unfortunate, and we extend our deepest condolences to her family, who have shown tremendous strength throughout our investigation.'
