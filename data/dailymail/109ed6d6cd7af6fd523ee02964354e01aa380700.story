Excess braggage: Kelly Brook shows off the world's first 'selfie suitcase'

Kelly, 34, said she couldn't wait to take her customised luggage - which is known as the '#HolidayBraggie' suitcase - on her next holiday this summer.

Ms Brook said: 'To have suitcases that feature my favourite holiday snaps, including a few of myself, is right up my street.

'Everyone loves to brag on social media these days and I'm 100 per cent guilty of a bit too much poolside boasting, but hey, who isn't.

'I've got a few more holidays planned this summer, so I can't wait to parade these cases around with me.'

The
jet-setting model is no stranger to holiday selfies - on a recent trip 
to Jamaica she treated her Twitter and Instagram followers to a rather 
busty holiday shot as she reclined on a sun lounger.

The 34-year-old posted the photograph where she appears to be basking in the Jamaican sunshine while relaxing by the ocean.

The star captioned the busty picture with simply the word 'Heaven.'

The
 selfie was uploaded after Ms Brook gave an interview to Hello! Magazine
 where she dished on her upcoming nuptials: 'I want the biggest, most 
gorgeous dress ever'.

She
 revealed how her whirlwind romance with fiance David McIntosh caught 
her by surprise and described the engagement as 'the most humbling, 
beautiful moment' of her life.

New research reveals that a third of holidaymakers see boasting about their break as a top five holiday 'must do' activity.

The nation now takes and shares more photos of themselves than their destination, the study found.

Mobile phone network Three quizzed 3,000 Brits about their social media holiday habits.

The survey found one in three (30 per cent) puts holiday bragging in their top five 'must-do' holiday activities while abroad.

A staggering third of these rank social media bragging over traditional sightseeing (36 per cent).

It also beats socialising (19 per cent), shopping (15 per cent) and reading (13 per cent).

Showing off: The company said it was encouraging people to brag abroad like they've never bragged before

More than eight out of 10 holidaymakers participated in bragging on their most recent holiday (85 per cent).

The
 top photos taken on their smartphones were sunsets (53 per cent), 
selfies (41 per cent), swimwear shots on the beach (24 per cent) and 
plane wings (22per cent).

And one in four admit the perceived 'braggability' of destinations influences where they decide to go on holiday (27 per cent).

Three is offering people the chance to win a holiday to one of 16 world destinations - and their own personalised '#HolidayBraggie' suitcase.

Participants should head to Facebook or Instagram and send in their best holiday photo by June 30. Kelly and six travel bloggers will pick the competition winner.

Tom Malleschitz, Three's Director of Marketing, said: 'We're now a nation of social media fanatics and this couldn't be more true than when we're on holiday.

'People are turning up the online bragging more than a notch or two while they're away

'We're encouraging people to brag abroad like they've never bragged before.

'If their snaps are good enough they might even get a personalised braggie suitcase to truly show-off their boasting efforts to the world.'Â
