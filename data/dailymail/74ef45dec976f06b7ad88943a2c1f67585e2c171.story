Criticised: Labour leader Ed Miliband has been attacked over his stance on Syria, with William Hague saying it has caused consternation around the world

Deep splits were appearing in Labour’s position on Syria last night, as it emerged world leaders have voiced ‘serious concerns’ about Ed Miliband’s stance.

William Hague claimed that the Labour leader’s politicking on Syria had caused consternation around  the world.

‘There’s some serious concern in other capitals, not just across the Atlantic,  but in European capitals as well about the position they’ve taken about voting down a government motion that actually had everything in it that they asked for,’ he told Sky News.

A Foreign Office source added:  ‘Washington and Paris have been very unimpressed indeed and they are not the only ones.’

Leading Labour figures appeared divided over the issue of Syria yesterday, with some ruling out support for any military strike while others appeared to want to keep options open.

Echoing comments made by the former leader Tony Blair, former Labour culture secretary Ben Bradshaw voiced concern about signs that Labour was turning its back on the world under Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Commenting on the Syria vote, he said: ‘I would be very worried if this signals a retreat from Labour being an internationalist party willing to do difficult things to make the world a better place.’

Shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said that, despite Labour’s demand for more ‘evidence, he had ‘no doubt’ that tyrant Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons and would use them again.

Mr Murphy, one of a number of Labour frontbenchers who appeared to be nodding agreement with Mr Cameron as he laid out the case for intervention last week, also said the Prime Minister should not rule out a second Commons vote.

Concerns: Ben Bradshaw, left, said he was worried the move could signal Labour's retreat as an international party while Jim Murphy said a second vote on intervention should not be ruled out

He said: ‘If there were to be really significant developments in Syria, and the conditions that we set in our motion on Thursday about it being legal, about the evidence being available, compelling evidence about a UN process, then of course the Prime Minister has the right to bring that back to Parliament.’

But the shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander suggested Labour would hold Mr Cameron to his word on Syria, regardless of developments in the country’s bloody civil war.

Unhappy: Meg Munn was one of the few Labour MPs to vote with the Government. She said she blamed both leaders for getting Britain into its current position

‘The Prime Minister has given his word now to the British people that the UK will not be participating,’ he said. ‘If he was now to return to the Commons and say well actually because the President of the United States has decided to go to the Congress, I’ve changed my mind about what Parliament was saying and what the British people were saying, I think that would weigh very heavily on the ability for him to convince the public or Parliament that his judgement was sound.’

Mr Miliband insisted Labour’s actions had not damaged the ‘Special Relationship’ with the United States.

But the party’s anti-intervention stance has appalled some senior Labour figures.

Lord Mitchell, who serves as an adviser on business to Mr Miliband, said: ‘We should take military action against Syria. Assad and his cronies are unspeakable. Why us? Because we stand for decency.’

Former Foreign Office minister Meg Munn, one of the few Labour MPs not to vote against the Government, said Mr Miliband had to take his share of the blame for the fact Britain now looks highly unlikely to back punitive action against Assad over his use of chemical weapons.

‘I think both leaders bear a responsibility for getting us into this position,’ she said.

Jim Murphy yesterday admitted he had sworn at Michael Gove in the immediate aftermath of the Commons vote on Thursday night. The shadow defence secretary is reported to have shouted, ‘F*** off you bully’, at the education  secretary after he accused Labour MPs of appeasing Assad. Commenting on the incident yesterday, Mr Murphy said: ‘I used industrial language that my priest would not be proud of.’
