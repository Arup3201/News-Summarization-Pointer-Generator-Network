Two parents left their two toddlers in their locked car in freezing temperatures while they went to a wine tasting, police have said.

Jennie Chang, 46, and Christophe Lucas, 41, were arrested in Washington D.C. on Saturday afternoon after a passerby spotted the children inside their Volvo and called 911.

By the time police reached the vehicle, their two-year-old daughter was 'crying hysterically' and her one-year-old brother had no socks or shoes on, according to the police report.

Neither of the children were wearing hats or gloves, police said in the report. 

Fleeing: Jennie Chang, 46, is seen running away from WJLA reporters after appearing in court on Monday. She and her husband were arrested for allegedly leaving their two young children inside a car for an hour

When they were found, temperatures outside plunged to 28 F (-2 C), WJLA reported.

Their parents were found at an upscale wine bar, Ris, about 400 feet away.

Lucas told police that they had left an iPhone inside the car so they could monitor the children. He said that his wife had also been keeping an eye on the vehicle.

But the restaurant manager said the couple had been inside for around an hour. 

Chang and Lucas were charged with two counts of attempted child neglect.

They spent Saturday and Sunday in jail before their initial appearance in D.C. Superior Court Monday afternoon, according to the Washington Post.

A judge released them on their own recognizance but they are not allowed to contact their children before their next hearing, which will be held on February 18.

They fled from WJLA reporters after leaving the hearing and dodged reporters' questions.

Both children are currently in the custody of Washington D.C.'s family services.

If convicted, the couple could each face $10,000 in fines and/or 10 years in prison.
