Rare footage has emerged of three Bengal tigers splashing around playing a terrifying game of cat and mouse.

The pictures are among the first to capture the endangered species front on looking them in the eye as they hurtle towards their prey.

The three big cats were caught on camera at The Institute of Greatly Endangered and Rare Species (T.I.G.E.R.S) wildlife reserve in Myrtle Beach in South Carolina.

The Bengal tiger is native to India, but can be found in smaller numbers in countries such as Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China

While footage already exists of big cats running from a profile view, it is thought to be incredibly rare to see them running directly towards the camera

They include a majestic white Bengali tiger called Uma, who weighs in at 350lbs, but can still accelerate at up to speeds of 47 mph.

She is joined by two-year-old red tiger, Ravi who weighs in at 300lbs and Yam, a 360lb orange and black Bengal aged six.

The tigers came out for play-time after record quantities of rain had left the ground at the wildlife reserve drenched.

Even though the cats weigh over 300lbs, they can accelerate at up to speeds of 47 mph

Dr Bhagavan Antle, who runs the reserve said: 'Tigers love water and are excellent swimmers'

Rare new footage has emerged of three Bengal tigers making a splash as they run towards their prey at a South Carolina nature reserve

Dr Bhagavan Antle, who runs the reserve said: 'Tigers love water and are excellent swimmers.

'They have webbed paws which makes it easy for them to make a kill on wet ground or in the water.'

The Bengal tiger is an endangered species, and it is thought there are only 2,500 left in the world

The 53-year-old, who has been living and working with the predators for over 30 years added: 'Usually, if a tiger is running straight for you like this then you're not going to live to tell the tale.'

The Bengal tiger is native to India but can also be found in smaller number in Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and China.

However, the species is endangered with fewer than 2,500 of the creatures left in the world.

It is said that illegal hunting and poaching, as well as the clearing of their habitats has led to their populations declining.
