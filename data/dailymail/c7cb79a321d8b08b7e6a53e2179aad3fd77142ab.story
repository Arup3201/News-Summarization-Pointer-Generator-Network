Southwest Airlines and SeaWorld Entertainment are ending their 25-year-old marketing partnership, officials with both companies said Thursday, after the airline was urged by animal rights activists to terminate the relationship.

The partnership won't be renewed at the end of the year when the current contract expires. As part of the partnership, three Southwest airplanes had various SeaWorld animals painted on their bodies.

Those planes will be painted over to Southwest's traditional look.

SeaWorld also had Southwest signs in its parks, and Southwest offered vacation packages to SeaWorld, as it does to other tourist destinations.

Fallout: SeaWorld has fielded a constant backlash since the 2013 release of documentary Blackfish, which chronicled the aquarium's 39-year treatment of killer whales in captivity 

SeaWorld officials said the decision was mutual.

SeaWorld wants to concentrate on growing markets in Latin America and Asia, the marine park company said in a statement.

'Southwest and SeaWorld have enjoyed their long relationship, and wish each other continued success,' the statement said.

SeaWorld has parks in Orlando, Florida; San Antonio and San Diego.

Southwest spokeswoman Marilee McInnis said it was a business decision as the airline intends to focus on international service.

Earlier this year, animal rights activist held a rally and dropped off a petition at Southwest, urging the airline to end the relationship.

The activists cited the documentary Blackfish, which explores what may have caused the killer whale Tilikum to kill SeaWorld trainer Dawn Brancheau in 2010.

The documentary argues that killer whales, when in captivity, become more aggressive to humans and each other.

Since the documentary, several entertainers have pulled out of planned performances at SeaWorld Entertainment Inc. parks.

Regarding the pressure from the activists, McInnis said Southwest has been in 'listening and education mode'.

'We ... have engaged and heard from conservationists, SeaWorld supporters, and others on all sides of this issue,' McInnis said.

The president of the animal rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals said in a statement that workers in her office were delighted to hear the partnership was ending.

'Champagne corks were popping at PETA today when we heard that Southwest will no longer support SeaWorld and will repaint its planes,' said Ingrid Newkirk.

'The second I heard the good news, I knew that I'd be booking my next trip on Southwest.'
