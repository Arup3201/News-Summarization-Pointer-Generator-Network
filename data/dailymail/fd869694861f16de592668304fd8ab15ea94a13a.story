A man has been charged with the first-degree murder of his girlfriend's son after he allegedly attacked the child because he was crying during a football game.

Tre'viance Markese Walker, 22, was looking after his girlfriend's baby for a few hours on December 7 while he watched the University of Oklahoma vs. Oklahoma State football game on TV.

The fve-month-old boy, identified only as JB, was grabbed so aggressively by Walker that his head 'snapped back', according to a police report.

The accused then dropped the child from a height of two feet, Fox 25 reported.

The baby boy was later found unresponsive in his playpen by other family members. He had bruising to the head and blood in his ear.

The baby was pronounced dead at hospital. An autopsy revealed he had a hematoma on the brain after suffering head trauma.

Walker initially denied that he had harmed the child but later admitted the abuse.

A neighbor Jimmy Shannon told Fox 25 that Walker was apparently angry about losing a $200 bet and that Oklahoma University had won the game.

Walker is being held at Cleveland County jail without bond. A court date has not yet been set.
