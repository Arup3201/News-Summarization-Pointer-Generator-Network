He saved the lives of countless youngsters through two decades of campaigning about road safety.

So when a new generation of smartphone-obsessed grown-ups began ignoring simple rules for crossing the street, there was only one solution: send for the Green Cross Code Man!

Today the fearless crusader dons his big green boots again for a new drive to persuade people not to text, make calls or listen to music while crossing the street.

Actor David Prowse is making a comeback as the Green Cross Man after 40 years for a new safety campaign

He played the safety superhero in the 1970s and 80s - deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport

David Prowse, who played the safety superhero throughout the 1970s and 1980s, has come out of retirement at the age of 79 to reinforce the mantra that he drummed home all those years ago: ‘Stop, look, listen, think.’ And while we’re about it – watch where you’re going instead of at your phone.

Granted, our resurrected hero is not quite as sprightly as he was. But anything he can do to halt the rise in accidents is surely good news for pedestrians (not to mention any drivers who don’t fancy getting a texting 20-something on their car bonnet.)

Yesterday he told me: ‘You see people wandering across the road with their eyes glued to their phones, or oblivious to what’s going on around them because they’re wearing huge headphones over their ears. In real life I can’t really walk up to people and tell them off because I’d probably get punched. But road safety is a real passion point for me, so I’m happy to help.’

It is hoped the online 21st century version aimed at grown-ups will be as successful as the 1970 campaign 

Mr Prowse, a married father of three who is also celebrated for his role as Darth Vader in Star Wars, was made an MBE by the Queen in 2000 for his contribution to road safety. Deaths and injuries involving children dropped dramatically during the campaign, sponsored by the Department of Transport, which began in 1971.

Now it is hoped an online 21st century version, sponsored by MORE TH>N insurance, will have similar benefits for grown-ups. 

One of the new films shows a young father pushing a pram into the road between parked cars while texting. Mr Prowse has not lost his ability to scold offending pedestrians: ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ he asks, before instructing him how to cross properly.

The actor still owns his trusty Droid, a small robot that helped him underline the original road safety message. (He kept it in the shed at his South London home for 30 years before a Jedi society volunteered to restore it last year.)

He has also kept hold of the original outfit, although thankfully he wasn’t required to wear the improbably tight leggings he sported as a younger crusader. ‘I’m afraid I can’t get in them any more,’ he admits.
