A 31-year-old man has been questioned by police over the horrific death of teenager Jessica Chambers, as police continue to analyse surveillance footage showing her 90 minutes before she was burned alive.

Derrick Turner said he was quizzed on Monday at the Panola County jail, but denied that he had anything to do with the Mississippi murder.

Turner said that he had no idea why he was brought in by the authorities.

Last moments: Jessica Chambers, 19, was caught on surveillance footage just 90 minutes before she was burned alive along the side of a rural road on Saturday. She is seen walking towards the store

Tragic: Jessica Chambers, 19, was doused with a flammable liquid and burned alive on Saturday night and police say they have not yet identified a suspect in her murder

Seen: A person off camera caught her attention and after waving, she walked over to say hello

He told Wmcactionnews5.com: 'I was just called in for a situation I didn't know nothing about. They was just asking me did I know her or was I sleeping with her, you know. Like I said, I didn't know her like that.'

He added: 'She was a sweet girl so that's why I'm messed up about it, whatever happened to her, I hate it happened you know.'

Police are investigating footage that shows Chambers walking across a gas station forecourt in Courtland before waving at someone off camera and going to speak to them.

She then walks into the store and pays before returning to her car. A man can be seen filling up a gasoline can beside her vehicle, but police say he has been cleared in the investigation.

The footage released by police shows Jessica just before 6.30pm on Saturday. About 90 minutes later, a motorist called 911 to report a burning car a mile away and first responders arrived to find the young woman covered in flames.

She fell to the ground and whispered something to one of the fire officers. Investigators have not revealed what she said but indicated that they may help find her killer, WMC reported.

'She was able to communicate. It was difficult,' said Jay Hale, an assistant district attorney who prosecutes cases in Panola County.

Convenience store manager Ali Fadhel said Chambers came in frequently and he would often speak with her.

He told The Associated Press that Chambers spoke with someone before entering the store to purchase gas.

On her way out, Chambers got a call on her cellphone, Fadhel said.

After she pumped gas, she re-entered the store, bought cigarettes, and drove away, heading south on Highway 51, he said.

According to Fadhel, Chambers was wearing a dark-colored sweater and pajama pants that looked like sweatpants. Chambers said she was going to make a stop before going home, Fadhel said.

'If she knew she had a problem with somebody, she would have told me,' Fadhel said.

Chambers bought $14 worth of gas, more than the $5 or so she usually purchased, he said.

'I asked her, 'Why are you putting so much gas?' She said, 'I'm going somewhere,'' Fadhel said.

Hale said he could not comment on Fadhel's statements.

'We've talked to a lot of people and some of those people could end up being a suspect,' District Attorney John Champion told USA Today on Wednesday. 'But as of right now we have not questioned anybody who we believe to be a suspect.'

He added: 'I feel like it's something we're going to solve. It could be in the next five minutes, five months or five years. You just don't know.'

Peter Odom, an attorney who prosecuted some arson cases, told HLN's 'Nancy Grace' that investigators will be assessing the physical appearance of suspects.

Questions: While she was inside, a man (seen top right) filled up a gas can close to her car (the dark vehicle in the center) but he has been cleared. After going inside the shop, she drove off

Terrifying: She had told her mother she was going out to get food when she and her car were set alight

'They're looking for someone with singed eyebrows and maybe burned hands. Because the burner often gets burned,' he said.

Police have not disclosed what Chambers said or tried to say, but her father, Ben Chambers, told the channel she told them who was responsible for the horrifying crime.

'She told them, she told them, told him who done it,' he said.

When responders arrived on the scene, she was walking along Herron Road, near Highway 51, and covered in flames, and was flown to Region One Health in Memphis but later died.

Authorities said initial autopsy results reveal the girl died from severe burns that covered 98 per cent of her body.

'I mean it's bad,' DA John Champion told Fox. 'I have been doing this for 21 years and as far as the means of death it is certainly the worst I have dealt with.'

Panola County Sheriff Dennis Darby said she had been doused with a flammable liquid and set on fire. Her father also said she had 'a big gash on her head'.

'They squirted lighter fluid down her throat and in her nose, and apparently they knocked her out,' added Mr Chambers, a maintenance worker for the sheriff's department.

'When the fire department got there, she was walking down the road on fire ... only part of her body that wasn't burned was the bottom of her feet.'

Scene: Her car was found along this dirt bank and she was found walking along the road in flames

As well as the surveillance footage, detectives have been examining the girl's cellphone, which was found at the scene. Her car was also at the scene but was left completely charred by the inferno.

Authorities are also looking into reports that she went to a party before her death, Chambers said.

Friends said that the family can't think of anyone that might have wanted to hurt Jessica, who didn't have a boyfriend and was not known to have been seeing anyone.

They added that she had just started a new job at Goody's Department Store, which she loved.

Lisa Chambers, the girl's mother, begged with anyone to come forward with any information they may have about the heinous crime.

'They have ripped everything I have,' she told Fox. 'She left to go clean out her car and was going to get [herself] something to eat.'

Chambers' grandmother, Dot Boatright, said the family was doing as well as can be expected. Boatright said she 'went all to pieces' when she heard about Chambers' death.

Heartbroken: Her mother, Lisa Chambers, sobbed as she pleaded with the public for information

Ripped apart: Her father Ben, right, said someone poured lighting fluid down his daughter's throat and nose before setting her alight. He has also appealed for any information in her death

Not much was immediately revealed about the woman's background by authorities, but Boatright said of her granddaughter, 'She was just a sweet little girl.'

Amanda Prince, who identified herself as Jessica Chambers' older sister, told CNN Wednesday night that the family is 'shocked, lost ... confused, angry, hurt.'

'I have so many questions,' she said. 'I want to know why.'

Asked if she knew of anyone who had a grudge against her sister or might want to hurt her, Prince replied, 'No one. She was loved by everybody. I don't know who would want to do this or why.'

Prince described her sister as 'very athletic' and outgoing, and said that at various times she had expressed interest in becoming a nurse, a dentist and a writer.

'She was happy all the time,' she said. 'She made everyone laugh. She lit up a room. ... She was just full of life.'

The Mississippi Bureau of Investigation is assisting Panola authorities because of her father's connection to the police department. No arrests have yet been made.

Mississippi authorities say they have received offers to help from several agencies, including the U.S. attorney's office and the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

Autopsy results have not been released, and it was not clear when they would be available.

Anyone with information on the murder should contact the Sheriff's Office at 662-563-6230.

A candle-lit vigil will be held for Jessica on Saturday.
