Suspect: Hans Hansen, seen in court, was reportedly suicidal on Wednesday when he fired at cops from three different police departments 

Armed and dangerous? Authorities have said Hansen had eight guns on Wednesday, including two AK-47s and an AR-15

Hansen's motive is believed by police to have been suicide, the affiliate station reported.

The 43-year-old's potential leg amputation, a suicidal son, as well as a cabinet business going under were also reportedly revealed in the documents.

In a Monday court appearance filmed by KCPQ, prosector Ed Stemler said 'The defendant indicated he was suicidal and wanted to die.'

KCPQ reported the documents alleged that if Hansen wasn't prevented by police, he would have shot up Marysville Navy Support Complex.

Stemler also said 'This was a very dangerous and violent outburst directed at police officers at multiple departments.' 

Authorities have said Hansen had eight guns on Wednesday, including two AK-47s and an AR-15, the affiliate station reported.

According to The Daily Herald, an affidavit shows that Hansen claimed he faced a foreclosure on his home and fought with his wife on Wednesday before he drank alcohol - and that he admitted to the various shootings.

Hansen is accused of shooting at multiple targets: first a building he was evicted from, then  at a Granite Falls patrol vehicle with no one inside, followed by the Lake Stevens police station and patrol vehicles for the department with no one inside, and later Marysville officers, the newspaper reported. 

Police arrested him for first-degree assault charges and drive-by shooting charges, though they have not yet been filed, the newspaper said.
