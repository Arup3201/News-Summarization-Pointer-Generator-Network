The men who spent eight days clinging to the hull of a boat after being stranded at sea have spoken of their near-death experience and how they survived on seaweed and will.

Anthony Douglas, 57, and Mike Russell, 58, from Freeport, Bahamas, set out on a fishing trip on September 7 on a 16-foot boat when a fierce storm caused it to capsize.

They were eventually rescued on September 14 when a passing freighter spotted the men near Palm Beach County and a coast guard helicopter lifted them to safety.

Speaking from his home in Abaco Island, Anthony Douglas described how the storm flooded their boat with water before a giant wave caused them to capsize.

He told The Bahamas Tribune the boat ride was easy until 'out of nowhere bad weather appeared from all sides'.

'The weather came from all four parts of the sky. I could see Bimini from where we were, but I could not beat the weather.

'Water started coming into the boat 
and then a wave came and threw us out. I had a searchlight in the pants 
and it didn’t fall out so I grabbed and tried to look for Big Mike, 
because we got thrown in two different directions.

'When I saw him, he was going under and so I swam to him, grabbed him and put him on top of the boat,' he said.

The pair spent the next eight days 
adrift, taking turns sleeping for a couple of minutes at a time, sucking
on seaweed to survive and praying someone would see them.

'We were having conversations with 
people that were not there, pretending to eat food, we knew we didn’t 
have, we were just losing it,' Anthony explained.

'It got so bad that around day six 
Big Mike jumped in the water and said to me "I’m holding you back, you 
can survive without me".'

He jumped in behind him and told him: 'We are going to get out of here together,' before dragging him back on to the hull and tying their shirts together.

'Keep praying. Pray from your heart not from your belly,' he said.

US Coast Guard officers had just finished a training mission, like the one seen in this file photo, before rescuing the two stranded men

'The boat wasn’t balanced, we had to 
stay straight or the boat would have turned over. We saw so many boats 
pass us.

'I almost got run over from a tanker and nobody still saw us. 
The best day of our lives was when we saw that chopper.'

The men's prayers were answered when a tow boat spotted them soon after, gave them water and contacted the U.S. Coast Guard.

A helicopter whisked them to land where they were treated at Delray Beach Medical Center.

According to the Sun Sentinel, they 
were severely hydrated, the sun and salt water left their skin damaged 
and their hands raw from gripping the fiberglass.

Most people can only survive without water for three days.

'They were really exposed and really deteriorating quickly,' Coast Guard rescue swimmer Kyle Stallings said to The Sun Sentinel.

Stallings
also said the victims were completely waterlogged when found. He said 
their skin was deteriorating and their eyes were drooping.

'They were both in tears. You could tell they were on their last straw of hope,' Stallings said.
