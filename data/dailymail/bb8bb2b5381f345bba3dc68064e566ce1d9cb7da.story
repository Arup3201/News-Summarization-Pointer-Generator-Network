Alan Pardew's sudden departure as Newcastle manager on Monday has lit up social media after his shock move to become Crystal Palace manager.

Former Newcastle players Michael Owen and Joey Barton have posted their support of Pardew's decision to return to Crystal Palace, where he played from 1978-1991, whilst Labour MP for Newcastle Central Chi Onwurah wished it was owner Mike Ashley leaving the club.

Pardew ended four years at the helm at St James' Park on Monday following a £2million compensation settlement between the south London club and Ashley was agreed.

Barton, who played for Newcastle between 2007-2011, posted a series of tweets on Monday evening praising the work of Pardew during his time as Magpies manager before attacking owner Mike Ashley.

The midfielder, now playing for Queen's park Rangers, believes Tony Pulis should be given the job but inferred that the next Newcastle manager will have to accept Ashley's control on proceedings.

'But he will no doubt appoint somebody who he can control and that will accept transfers being out of their control. Pulis won't have that,' Barton posted on his Twitter.

Another former Newcastle player Michael Owen, who endured an injury plagued four year stint at the club, posted his support for Pardew on social media following months of abuse from sections of the Magpies fans.

'Some may think it is strange for Alan Pardew to want to leave a huge club for a smaller one but the scar left by months of abuse will never heal,' Owen said on his Sportlobster account.

'Plus, the lure of going back to the club closest to your heart can never be underestimated,' added Owen.
