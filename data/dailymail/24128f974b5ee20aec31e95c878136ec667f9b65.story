Her denomination has upset Catholics, so it’s no surprise the conservative evangelicals' favourite presidential candidate has left her church.

Republican Michele Bachmann, 55, has quit the congregation she has belonged to for more than 10 years with her husband in their home state.

Congresswoman Bachmann and her husband Marcus have withdrawn their membership from Salem Lutheran Church in Stillwater, Minnesota.

The Bachmann couple had not been attending for more than two years although they were still church members, reported CNN.

Some Catholics have criticised the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod for describing the papacy institution as the ‘Antichrist’.

The denomination gets its roots from Martin Luther, who was behind the 16th century Reformation.

Mr Luther believed the Pope was obstructing the teaching of God’s free love in Jesus, and saw similarities to how the Antichrist is described in the New Testament.

The denomination has 390,000 members and 1,300
congregations in the U.S. and Canada.

They are now attending a non-denominational church in the Stillwater area, a congressional office spokesman said.

They officially left the church last month - shortly before her presidential campaign was announced, a Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod spokesman said.

The Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod has been criticised by some Catholics for its views on the papacy institution, which it calls the ‘Antichrist’, reported CNN.

But a spokesman for the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights said they see ‘no evidence of any bigotry’ in Mrs Bachmann.

They requested to leave six days before her bid was launched in June.

The spokesman told CNN he believes the couple are no longer attending within the synod, which counts Salem Lutheran Church as a member.

‘My understanding of the situation was the timing of the request for release was far more coincidental than strategic,’ he said.

Salem Lutheran Church Pastor Marcus Birkholz told CNN he had been asked to make no comment about the Bachmann family.

Controversial: Revelations of Michele Bachmann's departure from her church comes after it was revealed she has ties with anti-gay preacher Bradlee Dean

Revelations of Mrs Bachmann's church departure have come after it was revealed she has ties with controversial preacher Bradlee Dean.

Mrs Bachmann has endorsed and prayed for Mr Dean and his business called ‘You Can Run But You Cannot Hide International’ in the past.

But Mr Dean has made anti-gay remarks and compared Osama Bin Laden to President Obama, reported the Huffington Post.

Their relationship has been compared to Mr Obama’s problematic links with another controversial preacher, Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
