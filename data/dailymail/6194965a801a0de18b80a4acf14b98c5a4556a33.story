Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have brought their own idiosyncratic take on the Scottish independence debate as they back the Yes vote.

Separatists have been mockingly comparing the battle for Ukraine with the referendum in Scotland, asking why England doesn't use military force and poking fun at the Queen and US President Barack Obama. 

One supporter of Novorossiya - the breakaway region of eastern Ukraine - posted a picture of the Saltire on Twitter along with the tongue in cheek question in Russian: 'Why doesn't England bomb the Scottish separatists?' 

Pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine have brought their own idiosyncratic take on the Scottish independence debate as they back the Yes vote. One supporter of Novorossiya posted this picture of the Saltire on Twitter along with the tongue in cheek question in Russian: 'Why doesn't England bomb the Scottish separatists?'

In one Twitter post a mock-up showed the Queen in discussions with Barack Obama. In the post, the Queen says: 'Obama, Scotland wants to separate! Help them to calm them down. Accuse them of running a bloody regime.' Obama replies with: 'And is there oil in Scotland?'The Queen answers: 'I will not give it to you!' Before Obama responds with: 'Sorry, Liz! No oil - no bloody regime!'

The meaning seems to be that the British government has not - as it should have done in Moscow's eyes - objected to military action against separatist areas populated by pro-Russians in Ukraine, yet it would never think of using force against Scotland.

Other postings show feared pro-Moscow rebel military commanders Igor Strelkov and Alexander 'Babay' Mozhaev dressed in kilts ready to intervene in Scotland.

'Babay will come. Will bring order to Scotland,' reads the text.

On the Strelkov picture, the wording is: 'Scotlandia will be free'

Another mock-up showed the Queen in discussions on the Scottish vote for independence with Barack Obama. 

In the post, the Queen says: 'Obama, Scotland wants to separate! Help them to calm them down. Accuse them of running a bloody regime.'

Meanwhile, Ukraine's president today said Russia had removed the bulk of its forces from his country.

The announcement has raised hopes for a peace drive which is now underway after five months of conflict in which more than 3,000 people have been killed.

Moscow has always denied sending troops into eastern Ukraine to support pro-Russian rebels battling Ukrainian forces, despite what Kiev and its Western backers say is overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Moscow also denies arming the separatists.

Speaking during a televised cabinet meeting, President Petro Poroshenko said Ukraine would remain a sovereign united country under the terms of a peace roadmap approved last Friday.

He did say however that parts of the east under rebel control would get special status.

He said: 'According to the latest information I have received from our intelligence, 70 per cent of Russian troops have been moved back across the border. 

'This further strengthens our hope that the peace initiatives have good prospects.'

Poroshenko did say however the ceasefire was not proving easy to maintain because 'terrorists' were constantly trying to provoke Kiev's forces.

Ukraine's military recorded at least six violations of the ceasefire overnight but said there were no casualties. Five servicemen have been killed during the ceasefire, Ukraine says. A civilian was also killed at the weekend during shelling of the eastern port of Mariupol.

Poroshenko said Ukraine was regrouping its forces in eastern Ukraine, not in preparation for a new offensive against the rebels, as they have suggested, but in order to defend territory from possible attack by the separatists.

The Kremlin said Russian President Vladimir Putin and Poroshenko were broadly satisfied with how the ceasefire, in place for nearly five days, was holding in Ukraine. The two leaders spoke by phone on Tuesday for the second time this week. 

In his televised remarks, Poroshenko offered the rebels an olive branch by saying he would propose a bill next week offering 'special status' to parts of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions of eastern Ukraine they now control.

But he was adamant in rejecting the separatists' demands for full independence for their regions and the kind of radical 'federalisation' favoured by Russia.

'The Minsk protocol envisages the restoration and preservation of Ukrainian sovereignty on all the territory of the Donbass (in eastern Ukraine), including that controlled by the fighters,' Poroshenko said.

'There is no question of federalisation or separation of any Ukrainian territory.'

The European Union and United States have imposed economic sanctions against Russia over its role in Ukraine, prompting Moscow to retaliate by banning most Western food imports.

The EU has prepared another wave of sanctions targeting Russia's banking and energy sectors but has held off implementing them to see whether the ceasefire holds.

On Wednesday, Poroshenko signed a law allowing Ukraine to impose its own sanctions against Russian firms and individuals deemed to be backing the separatists in eastern Ukraine.

In Prague, the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which is monitoring the ceasefire, said it would be reasonable to allow more time for the peace process before imposing more sanctions against Russia.

Didier Burkhalter, who is president of Switzerland, also said the OSCE would soon deploy drones to monitor the ceasefire.

Human rights group Amnesty International said in Moscow it had documented evidence of war crimes by both sides and also repeated criticism of Russia's role in the conflict.

'Amnesty International has called the conflict in Ukraine an international conflict and Russia a party to that conflict,' the group's secretary general, Salil Shetty, told a news conference.
