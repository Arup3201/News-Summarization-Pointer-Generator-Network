A grieving father shot himself and his dog at his son’s grave with a gun engraved in his memory so the three would be ‘united’ again, an inquest has heard.

Allen Hinchliffe, 52, shot himself twice in the abdomen at the grave of his son Ben, who had died six months earlier in a road accident.

Bradford Crown's Court heard Mr Hinchliffe was ‘extremely close’ to his 20-year-old son, and 
the pair would regularly go hunting with their beloved dog, Jake.

Despite pleading with 
police and paramedics not to help him, the court heard, Mr Hinchliffe, of Scholes, was taken 
to the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield.

After an initial recovery, he died three weeks later after his wounds became infected.

The inquest heard Mr Hinchliffe went to the cemetery in Hade Edge and the dog he and Ben had jointly owned, before turning the gun on himself.

The sports shotgun bore a plaque with the words: ‘In loving memory of Ben’, the inquest was told.

Mr Hinchliffe, of Scholes, was taken to the Northern General Hospital, Sheffield, despite pleading with police and paramedics not to help him, the court heard.

Armed
 police and paramedics were scrambled to Hade Edge Methodist  Church 
after neighbours spotted Mr Hinchliffe firing a shotgun in the 
graveyard.

One neighbour 
had spotted Mr Hinchliffe sitting in the churchyard for several hours 
despite poor weather before any shots were fired, the inquest heard.

The
 court heard the father had been ‘devastated’ by the loss of his son who
 died when his Suzuki 4x4 struck a wall at the junction of Penistone 
Road and Church Street, New Mill, on October 29, last year.

Concluding that Mr Hinchliffe had intentionally taken his life, Coroner Oliver Longstaff, said: 'It seems Mr Hinchliffe found it extremely difficult to keep on with life and the turn it had taken.

'I am entirely satisfied he went to Ben’s grave in the hope of uniting the three of them.'

Mr Longstaff added that Mr Hinchliffe, a former roofer, had shot his dog as a result of ‘acute distress rather than cruelty’.

The inquest heard that earlier in his life Mr Hinchliffe had suffered bouts of depression and had had his shotgun confiscated, although his licence was renewed after he recovered.

Mr Longstaff said: 'I am in no doubt that Mr Hinchliffe absolutely intended what was going to happen to him. The reasons why he felt that way are obvious and the steps he took are obvious.'
