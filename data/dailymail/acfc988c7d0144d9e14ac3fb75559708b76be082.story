Concerns: Esther Rantzen fears the allegations of 
child abuse surrounding Jimmy Savile could destroy her 'life's work', 
campaigning to protect children

Esther Rantzen fears the allegations of child abuse surrounding Jimmy Savile could destroy her 'life's work', campaigning to protect children it has emerged.

The presenter was last week forced to deny rumours she is facing the sack as patron of a child abuse charity after claims she failed to act on allegations that Savile molested youngsters.

Ms Rantzen, a patron of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC), had said earlier that some in broadcasting 'blocked their ears' to the claims against the Jill'll Fix It star 18 years ago.

But in an interview with the Daily Express, Ms Rantzen said: 'Say what you like about me – just please don’t destroy my life’s work.'

Ms Rantzen founded ChildLine, a 
24-hour confidential helpline that takes more than a million telephone 
calls a year providing free counselling for children to discuss abuse 
and neglect, in 1986.

For more than 25 years she has campaigned to raise awareness of the bullying and sexual or psychological abuse of children.

The 72-year-old, who is also a trustee of the NSPCC, said that she remembered finding Savile 'creepy' and 'very odd' and said that she had met him about six times at charity events.

She
 insisted she had only heard one rumour about Savile abusing young 
children and that was when she was working at the BBC as a researcher 
when she was 21.

Ms Rantzen added that her main motivation was to continue campaigning for children and older people and bring them justice.

She said: 'It
 would be such a great shame if all that work was sabotaged by this. My 
concern is for the children who are suffering and other survivors who 
need support.'

She told MailOnline: 'I would be 
very, very distressed if people lost confidence in me, particularly if 
people working with children lose confidence in me, but I'm told that 
everyone who works at whole-heatedly support me.'

Ms Rantzen said there might be lessons that could be learned from the scandal.

She said: 'A therapist said on Radio 4
 that Jimmy Savile groomed the whole nation and that is true. He 
convinced us all that he was a tireless charity worker and a harmless, 
eccentric entertainer. He wore a mask which disguised the fact that he 
was predatory and dangerous.

'I think it's very important that we discover if there are lessons that can be learned.

'We need to set in place a 
whistle-blowing process so that people can report abuse if things are 
happening or if they witness things.'

The interview with Ms Rantzen, who has been awarded an OBE and CBE, follows allegations by a sex abuse campaigner who said she confided in Ms Rantzen about Savile, but nobody acted on her concerns.

A slew of alleged victims have come forward to claim that the popular presenter molested them

Shy Keenan, 49, who founded Phoenix 
Survivors, a charity that supports child sex abuse victims and their 
families, says she heard the rumours and believed she a had a 'duty' to 
raise the alarm and so told Ms Rantzen after they were introduced 
through a sex offender specialist.

Ms Rantzen told the MailOnline last week how 
she had 'absolutely no recollection' of meeting Ms Keenan, who claimed 
she spoke up about the claims against the star 18 years ago.

Ms Rantzen said: 'If it's true I'm afraid I have absolutely no recollection of the conversation with her (Ms Keenan).

But she did concede that she had 
'literally had hundreds of conversations about child abuse but I'm sure I
 do not remember meeting this woman'.

She said: 'But I'm afraid that in my television life I did meet thousands of people.'

'It could have been after a 
program... It said in The Sun that Ray Wyre [the pioneering probation 
officer who worked with paedophiles] introduced us and I did know him 
very well.'

This week, Ms Rantzen said that what Savile did to children had produced 'national rage and fury'.

She said it would be a 'tragedy' if the scandal damaged ChildLine's work.

Scotland Yard said the 
investigation into Savile’s abuse of young girls has tripled in scale to
 340 separate lines of inquiry.

There are now 60 potential victims 
and 15 police forces investigating the paedophile BBC presenter’s six 
decade reign of child abuse.

David Cameron is facing Labour demands to set up an independent inquiry into the abuse scandal.

Labour leader Ed Miliband insisted 
that a broad inquiry into Savile’s activities at the BBC, Stoke 
Mandeville hospital and Broadmoor was essential to 'do right by the 
victims'.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller has 
dismissed calls for an independent inquiry, saying she was 'confident' 
BBC chiefs were taking the claims 'very seriously'.

But Mr Miliband said the BBC’s internal investigations were not enough.
