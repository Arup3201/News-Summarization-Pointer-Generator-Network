New rules on what can pass for jam and marmalade will spell the ‘end of the British breakfast as we know it’, the government has been warned.

Cutting the amount of sugar which must be used to call something jam will leave people eating the ‘coloured mud’ favoured by the French, Germans and Americans, Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt claims.

The aide to Business Secretary Vince Cable warns new regulations will mean jam is less tasty, dull in colour and will not last as long.

History: Traditional, sweet English jam could become a thing of the past with people forced to buy French-style 'fruit butter', the government has been warned

Ministers argue that cutting the minimum sugar level of jam from 60 per cent to 50 per cent will make it easier and more lucrative for British producers to export their goods.

The change will initially only affect England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit.

But Ms Munt, MP for Wells in Somerset, used a debate in Parliament today to call on the government to think again.

Warning: Lib Dem MP Tessa Munt dismissed low sugar jams as 'coloured mud'

She warns that customers will not know 
what they are buying, and instead of ‘glossy’ traditional jams will 
instead be forced to buy ‘fruit butter’.

‘I'm actually quite worried because I think this is going to be the end of the British breakfast as we know it,’ she told the BBC.

Ms Munt went on: ‘Our jams and marmalades are so important - and we know what to expect when we go into the supermarket or into our local shop or farm shops locally, we know exactly what we're going to buy when something says jam on it - or marmalade or jelly - we know exactly what to expect.

‘At the minute, we've got a jam that we know exactly what it's like. It's a fantastic colour, a really good shelf life, it's going to last a year.

‘It's beautiful consistency… it's got a gloss to it.

‘If these regulations change, we'll end up with something much more like the French and German product - and worse still the Americans - where they have things a bit like a fruit butter or a fruit spread.

‘It's dull colours that don't taste the same and they certainly don't last as long.’

Fears: Critics of the government's plans say that in future jam on sale in England will not be as brightly coloured

The idea that a fruit preserve must be 60 per cent sugar dates back to the 1920s.

Supporters argue it is necessary to ensure the sugar acts as a preservative, giving them a longer shelf life.

By reducing the minimum sugar levels, the jam will have to be boiled for longer to ensure it sets, and as a result the fruits will lose their colour and taste.

However, some producers argue it will make little difference because ‘reduced sugar jam’ already sold in this country must contain less than 50 per cent sugar.

Paul Gorman, from small producer Clippy's, said: 'Tessa Munt’s arguments are absolute nonsense.

'Jam already legally exists with sugar levels of 50 per cent or less.  Legally, this has to be called ‘reduced sugar jam’.  The issue is that there is a jams no-mans land between 51-59 per cent where there is basically no law.'

The government claims that many manufacturers want the changes to be made.

During the debate in Westminster Hall, Ms Munt said: 'We all know what we expect when we go to the supermarket - something that is of beautiful quality, beautiful colour and it has a shelf life of about a year.

'By reducing the percentage of total sugar, the characteristic gel-like consistency of jams and marmalade will be lost. The result will be an homogenised spreadable sludge that does not bear any resemblance to what we know in England and what we enjoy as British jam.

'With a 60% sugar content, the colours of sweet preserves are bright and characteristic of the fruit used to make the product. The fruit is fantastic.

'A lower percentage produces products with darker, muddier colours which may affect consumer confidence in the British product.

'In addition, if the consistency lacks the characteristic gel and is instead more like a fruit spread or a fruit butter, consumer confidence in the properties of jam and similar products may be lost.'

Environment minister George Eustice said the Government intended to support the proposal because manufacturers would still be able to make jam with 60 per cent sugar.

Speaking in the debate, Mr Eustice said: 'The reduction in the minimum sugar levels to 50 per cent delivers the greatest flexibility to the industry as a whole in a way that I do not think will be detrimental to those who are in compliance with the regulations.'

The regulations drawn up by the UK government have been approved by the EU and are now making their way through a series of committees.

Tory MP Tobias Ellwood said the Government should consider introducing a kite mark for all jams with 60 per cent sugar content.

And Tory MP Priti Patel said the Government should be helping British producers to export their jam around the world.

In a jam: Make the most of  strawberries - try our recipe for the perfect jam

STEP ONE

STEP TWO

STEP THREE

To make 2.5kg (5lb 8oz) of jam, first wash, hull and pick through 1kg
(2lb 4oz) fresh strawberries, discarding any blemished or overripe
fruit. Handle carefully so as not to bruise them. To remove the hull,
or calyx (the green leafy top), angle a sharp knife and cut in a
circular motion around the hull and into the flesh beneath. Chop the
strawberries into quarters and place in a large, heavy-based pan and
add the juice of ½ a lemon

Add 450g (1lb) of jam sugar with pectin and stir together. Leave for
1 hour. Freeze a few saucers to test for the setting process later.
Bring the pan to a rapid boil, skimming off any scum. After 15-20
minutes, take a frozen saucer and drop some jam on to it. Allow to cool
for a minute, then push your finger in - if it wrinkles, it's ready; if
not, continue boiling. Keep testing until the jam has set. Leave for
15-20 minutes to stop it rising in the jars

Spoon the jam into sterilised jars. Seal tightly with
screw-top lids while the jam is still hot, and write labels with the
date when they were filled. If the jars have been sterilised properly,
the jam should keep for 6 months in a cool, dry place. (To sterilise
jars, wash with very hot water or put through the hot cycle of a
dishwasher. Place the jars on a baking tray and bake at 160C/gas 3 for
10-15 minutes. Keep them warm until you fill them)
