A suicide bomber who reportedly blew himself up in Syria was a U.S. citizen who grew up in Florida, it emerged today.

According to internet postings, the man - who called himself 'Abu Hurayra Al-Amriki' - carried out one of four suicide attacks on May 25 in Syria's Idlib province.

He is believed to have been fighting on behalf of Jabhat al-Nusra, Al Qaeda's affiliate attempting to oust the government of Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Two U.S. officials have now confirmed to CNN that the bomber was an American jihadi who grew up in Florida and went to school there.

An American suicide bomber calling himself 'Abu Hurayra al-Amriki' allegedly carried out one of four suicide bombings on May 25 in Syria's Idlib province

However, the unnamed officials have not revealed the bomber's real name or any other details that would shed light on his identity.

His assumed name does not offer many clues, either.

Abu Hurayra was a companion of the prophet Mohammed, while Al-Amriki translates as 'the American' in Arabic.

Earlier this week it was revealed that U.S. government agencies are examining social media postings 
purporting to show how the American blew himself up in northern 
Syria.

The
 officials, who declined to be identified, said U.S. agencies assessed 
that the postings were likely authentic.

One said some investigators 
believed they knew the 'U.S. person's' true identity, but declined to 
give further details.

If
 his identity is officially confirmed, he would be the first American known to have
 committed a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al Qaeda, said Laith 
Alkhouri, a senior analyst with Flashpoint Global Partners, which 
monitors militant websites for government and private clients.

Should the bomber's identity be confirmed, he would be the first American known to have committed a suicide bombing in Syria on behalf of Al-Qaida

Alkhouri
 said social media postings, including Twitter messages and a video 
posted on YouTube, showed Abu Hurayra posing in a still picture with 
three other suicide bombers, one of whom was Syrian.

The other two were 
foreigners.

The
 video shows a truck-sized vehicle being loaded with explosives and then
 cuts to a long-shot of a fortress-like structure on top of a hill being
 blown up.

Shiraz Maher, a researcher with a University of London think tank, 
said that last week, an Al-Qaida media outlet issued a short promotional
 video about a forthcoming film related to an 'American' fighter in 
Syria.

The
 teaser, which opens with a graphic of a burning American flag and an 
exhortation to 'Join the Caravan of Jihad and Martyrdom,' promotes a 
longer video featuring 'The story of an American Muhajir (visitor) in 
Sham (Syria).'

The
 short video includes a brief sound bite in which a man with an American
 or Canadian accent, whose face is blurred, declares: 'It is huq (right) on you to fight.'

Maher,
 whose think tank has studied the role of social media in recruiting 
foreigners to join militant groups in Syria, said he had spoken to a 
British fighter in Syria who confirmed the suicide bomber was American 
and described him as 'a beautiful brother.'

One
 Twitter message included a picture of a man identified as Abu Hurayra 
holding a kitten, as well as pictures of the booby-trapped truck and an 
explosion.

Two officials said the FBI and Justice Department were aware of the case.
