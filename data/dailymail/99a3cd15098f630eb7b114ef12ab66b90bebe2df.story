Murdered: Aliyah Shell was killed in a drive-by shooting while sitting with her family on her porch

A six-year-old girl has died after being shot outside her house in a mysterious drive-by attack.

Two teenage gang members have been arrested over Aliyah Shell's murder in Chicago on Saturday afternoon, one of seven killings in the city over the weekend.

Neighbours have paid tribute to the slain girl, calling her 'our little angel' and saying she was 'really sweet'.

Aliyah was sitting on her front porch with her mother and sister in the Little Village neighbourhood of western Chicago when a grey pick-up truck drew up outside the house.

Someone fired four shots at the family and two of them hit the six-year-old in the abdomen, according to a neighbour who watched the carnage.

She was taken to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead.

On Sunday afternoon, police removed a pink piece of clothing decorated with Minnie Mouse from the family's porch.

Two teenagers were arrested and charged with murder and aggravated discharge of a firearm in the wake of the killing.

Juan Barraza, 18, and an unnamed 16-year-old are believed to be attached to a street gang called the Latin Kings.

Aliyah's older sister, Desiree Valzquez, was inside the house when the young girl was shot.

'They started shooting but I thought it was fireworks,' she told NBC Chicago.

'I ran outside, and my mom was holding my sister. My sister wasn't talking anymore. She wasn't breathing.'

Neighbour Clara Navarro, who witnessed the killing from across the street, told the Chicago Tribune of her shock at the violent incident.

'Our little angel, our little angel,' she said. 'I guess the Lord needed her.'

Another neighbour said she knew Aliyah well, adding: 'Every time she's come over, she'd eat bananas.

'She was really sweet, she would be smiling. She was a good girl. It wasn't her fault.'

The six other Chicago murders over the weekend were all of men in their 20s.

A total of 39 people were shot in the city between Friday evening and Sunday afternoon.
