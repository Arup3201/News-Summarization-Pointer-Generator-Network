Dr. Eduardo Quesada was taken to hospital in Manchester, New Hampshire for treatment while his wife was pronounced dead at the scene of the home they were both staying in

Authorities in New Hampshire have ruled out foul play in the death of a prominent doctor's wife - who was found dead next to her unconscious husband on Monday - but remain quiet about the circumstances of her death.

The body of Sonia Quesada was found at her mother-in-law's home in Bedford  - nearly two months after they were both savagely beaten during a home invasion robbery at their $1.4million residence.

Her husband, Dr Eduardo Quesada, was alive - but unconscious - nearby.

Police would not speculate on the cause of Mrs Quesada's death, pending the results of toxicology tests.

New Hampshire medical examiner Dr Thomas Andrew told the Boston Herald that Sonia Quesada's death is 'not being investigated as a homicide.

'Certainly there is no evidence of a traumatic cause of her death. Thereâ€™s no trauma.'

Sonia Quesada was declared dead on arrival in a suspected suicide by paramedics at her mother-in-law's Bedford condominium and Dr. Eduardo Quesada was taken to Catholic Medical Center in Manchester for treatment.

Police Chief John Bryfonski said that police were able to communicate with Dr Quesada, but would not elaborate on what was said except that a 'large amount of prescription medication' was recovered from the scene and neither husband or wife showed any signs of trauma.

The couple's 2-year-old daughter was not at the home during the incident and police said that she was in the custody of a family member.

Emergency services were called by relatives to the home at around 10am on Monday after family members could not reach the Quesadas by telephone, after they failed to show up for a planned meeting earlier in the day.

Chief Bryfonski said that there were no signs of forced entry and that police had to break down the door to gain entry to the home of Norma Quesada, 81, the mother of the doctor.

In addition, no forced entry was evident prior to officers 
entering the home and no one else was found inside the residence.

In November, Quesada and his wife were both hospitalized with serious injuries after an attack at their Bedford home.

The couple provided police with a description of a six-foot-tall man wearing a black ski mask and dark clothing who broke in and beat them both unconscious.

At the time police said that the attack 
may have been random and following this incident, authorities said that 
they were treating it as a separate matter.

Julie Taylor, president of The Mews at Bedford, the 55-plus community where Dr and Mrs Quesada were living, said she had made no connection between Norma Quesada and Eduardo Quesada.

'I think that's one of the reasons why the whole incident on Proclamation Court was upsetting ... (was) the fact that there weren't answers for it,' Taylor said.

'Everybody wants to know we're safe because this was an isolated incident, and maybe it was, but the police couldn't confirm any of that for whatever reason.

'Everyone that knows about it now doesn't seem particularly frightened because they believe it is an isolated incident that finished playing out,' she said.

The couples $1.4 million home is in Manchester, New Hampshire and was invaded by an intruder on Saturday evening

In November, Dr Eduardo Quesada, 52, and his wife Sonia were attacked in their Bedford home on after an apparent break-in at their 2.7 acre $1.4million property.

Though they initially reported it as a home invasion-burglary, all theories were being investigated in the wake of revelations that the doctor was arrested last year for a domestic assault.

Dr Quesada faced simple assault and obstructing the report of a crime or injury from the November 2011 domestic disturbance call but they were dropped.

'We're not making any connections at this point,' said police chief John Bryfonski after the November 24th home attack.

'The homeowners were obviously confronted by a person or persons of interest.

'We're looking for and expanding the search for evidence at the scene to help investigators unravel what may have happened there.'

Police investigating the home invasion have turned to the Drug Enforcement Administration to help with their inquiries

After the November incident police were called by Sonia Quesada.

The doctor's 
wife was able to rush to her neighbor's home covered in blood after escaping her assailant and knock 
on their door to raise the alarm.

At the time, police said that Mrs Quesada had been attacked but was only able to provide a vague description of her assailant.

'Very, very general and nonspecific and not something that would be useful or helpful to release at this point,' Bryfonski said.

Arriving at the home, police 
discovered the couple's two-year-old child and Dr Quesada lying on the 
floor so injured that police initially thought he was dead.

Bedford Police have insisted that they do have a person of interest but are not going to ask the public for their help with their investigation

Back in November, authorities did not say whether the family was targeted, or whether anything was stolen.

The house was put on the market for $1.4million and was in contract at the time of the attack.

While
the police keep their cards close to their chest the involvement of the
DEA and Dr Quesada's position as a respected anesthesiologist at the 
Elliot Hospital Pain Management Center in Manchester may be linked.

'It could have potentially been a 
hostage situation,' chief Bryfonski said. 'That was a 
consideration, that was part of the plan, but the overarching concern 
was the safety of the homeowner and the child.'
