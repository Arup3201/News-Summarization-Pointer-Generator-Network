A 'secret' Facebook group has emerged which shows trainee police officers blacked up, wearing Nazi uniforms and posing for pictures surrounded by women in stockings and suspenders.

In posts on the page, former students at the Ashford Training Centre, in Kent, have also left sexist and homophobic jokes.

Underneath a picture 'of the class of 1984' which shows two trainees with Swastikas and a third person blacked up, one group member has written: 'Cracking pic for the Daily Mail!'.

'Sure you asked everyone if you wanted them on the internet with a Nazi flag?'

The picture is understood to have been taken after a jokey end of course sketch.

Comments: A user wrote underneath the picture that trainee police officers would not be able to get away with the same things now. There is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch

Irony: A Facebook user suggests that the picture, which appears to show a police officer blacking up, would make a good news story. There is no reason to suspect anyone posting on the page was involved in the 1984 end of course sketch

Deputy Chief Constable Paul Brandon of Kent Police said: ‘Standards of behaviour have improved significantly in the last 30 years. What was acceptable as shown in an end of course sketch in 1984, would not now be appropriate behaviour by police officers.’

Despite
 the offensive comments on the Facebook page, a spokesman for Kent 
Police said they are not investigating at all.

The pictures
 came to light today after a disgusted retired police officer handed the
 photos to Kerry-Anne Mendoza at the current affairs website iacknowledge.

The Facebook group 'I Survived Ashford Police Training Centre' was initially set up for new recruits who attended the centre between 1973 and 2006.

As well as sharing controversial images and jokes, many of the 2,000 members were using it 'almost like a confessional' to boast about inappropriate behaviour and even occasions where they knowingly broke the law.

Many of the posts on the page are harmless and are filled with people reminiscing about their time at the training centre.

However, because of the more extreme content the group was made secret last month so no-one can see it unless they are invited to join.

The administrator wrote on the page: 'It doesn't bear thinking about if some of the stories and photos got in the wrong hands. The media could have a whale of a time.'

'Confessions': Former users reminisce about their time at the Ashford Police Training Centre. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing - and many of the posts on the group are harmless

One posting appears to suggest that 
part of the training at Ashford was showing potential officers how to 
take suspects 'down an alley and sort 'em out'.

Other
 posts revealed apparent bigoted 
behaviour among the trainees, with one officer who claims to have been 
recruited in 1995 responding to a message about popular senior figures 
by saying his own sergeant: 'certainly wasn't the shaved-headed 
ginger-haired Sgt from Sussex that eventually got the sack for 
inappropriate gayness!!!'

The former officer went on to say that the page shows the training centre was a 'drink fest and a sh*g fest'. She added: 'It's very much a culture of what happens at Ashford stays at Ashford'.

Other people who said they were former trainees claimed they had stolen beer from the training centre's bar, removed signs from doors and thrown bangers off the roof.

Another officer bragged about driving panda cars to the top of a steep hill, then letting them roll back down without brakes to see how fast they would go.

The Ashford Police Training Centre closed in 2006 after training officers for the British Transport Police and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, City of London, Essex, Guernsey, Hampshire, Hertfordshire, Jersey, Kent, Norfolk, Surrey, Sussex and Thames Valley police forces, as well as the Royal Parks Constabulary from 1973.

A spokesman for the College of Policing, which was set up in 2012 to set standards in policing, said they had no way of knowing if people who have posted on the Facebook page were still serving police officers.

He added that many of the pictures appear to have been taken decades ago.

'As the new professional body for policing, we set standards for the service and the behaviour shown does not reflect what we would expect in modern-day policing,' the spokesman said.

'We encourage officers and police staff to use social media as an important tool to engage with communities, gather intelligence and help keep people safe.

'Each person working in the service needs to ensure their online presence meets the standards expected of them.'

A spokesman for Kent Police said they are not investigating the group.

'We can confirm that no complaints regarding this matter have been received,' he said.

'Kent Police is not investigating this matter at present. The images appear to be from the late 1970s or 1980s, and there is nothing we can see that constitutes serving officers making inappropriate comments or being involved.'
