Umer Nazir said he was shocked by the racial abuse

The racism crisis engulfing Scotland Yard took a dramatic turn last night as an officer was exposed for abusing an Asian takeaway manager.

In an appalling drunken outburst, PC Philip Juhasz, 31, told the Pakistani to ‘go back to your f****** country’. The disgraced officer faces the sack for gross misconduct after being convicted of a racially aggravated public order offence.

But the case raises serious questions about the determination of police to stamp out all traces of racism among their ranks.

Senior black officers in the Metropolitan police said warnings about growing prejudice have been falling on deaf ears for almost a decade.

They claimed the lessons from the murder of black teenager Stephen Lawrence are yet to be learned, almost 13 years after the

Met was branded ‘institutionally racist’. Senior officers fear the crisis has overshadowed the massive boost created by the long-awaited conviction of his racist killers Gary Dobson and David Norris.

The Met said 19 employees – 18 officers and one civilian member of staff – are under investigation for racism. The force is braced for a wave of fresh claims amid warnings that other forces are not immune from allegations of racism.

The Police Service of Northern Ireland revealed yesterday that four officers have been suspended over racist and sectarian text messages.

And new figures emerged that reveal police forces in England and Wales receive around 1,000 complaints of racism every year.

Last night an investigation by Channel 4 News found that in the 12 years after the Macpherson Report, 120 Metropolitan police officers were found guilty of racist behaviour but just one was dismissed.

Plunged into a fresh racism row: Scotland Yard referred the case to the IPCC for further investigation

The dossier of ten cases facing the MET

Takeaway manager Umer Nazir, 23, is the victim of one of ten cases referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) by the Met over the last week.

In comments which raise serious questions about the determination of police to stamp out all traces of racism among their ranks, he said other Met officers tried to get Juhasz off the hook at the scene and three colleagues vouched for his good character in court.

He suffered abuse from Juhasz while working late at the Delice de France snack kiosk at King’s Cross railway station last September.

The shop manager said Juhasz, who was off-duty and drunk, demanded to be sold for half price food that was about to be thrown away.

When he refused, the officer pulled out his warrant card saying: ‘Do you know who I am? I’m a police officer’, before asking where the worker was from.

Mr Nazir said: ‘He said, “Oh, I’ll tell you where you’re from – you’re from Pakistan, and your ******g family are dying from lack of food over there.

‘You are wasting our food in this country, you f****** w*****r. Go back to your f****** country”.’

Two uniformed police officers stopped 
as they were passing by but let the suspect go when he showed them his 
warrant card. Minutes later, officers from British Transport Police 
responded to the 999 call and retrieved CCTV footage of the police 
officer gesticulating aggressively.

They
identified Juhasz, who is believed to work at a North London domestic 
violence unit, and he was arrested before appearing in court two weeks 
ago.

Mr Nazir said he was shocked when three colleagues of Juhasz turned up to help defend him.

But the police officer was convicted and fined £1,000. He now faces dismissal when an internal panel meets within weeks.

The case is the latest to emerge during a week in which Britain’s biggest force has been rocked by accusations of racism.

Leroy
Logan, who founded the Met Black Police Association, called on 
Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe to return ‘rooting out the bad boy cops’
to the top of the agenda.

He
said he was ‘disappointed’ by the Met’s failure to take effective 
action in the wake of the 1999 Macpherson Report into the racist murder 
of Stephen Lawrence. He added: ‘Every year since 2001, the young people 
have been saying how they believe they are being dealt with 
disrespectfully, not shown enough dignity, casual racist comments were 
being used.

‘We were telling the Met Police, some two or three commissioners back, this is what is coming up.

‘But
like so many things, it lands on deaf ears until such a time as a free 
press – the media – get hold of it and forces people into action.’
