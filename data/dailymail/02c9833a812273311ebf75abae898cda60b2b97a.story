Czech President Milos Zeman launched a foul-mouthed tirade against Russian protest group Pussy Riot during a bizarre radio interview. 

The 70-year-old leader described the band, who regularly protest against Vladimir Putin as 'f****d up' and 's****'. 

Swearing in both English and Czech, Zeman asked the interviewer: 'You know what pussy means in English?' He then translated the word into the Czech for c***, leading to dozens of complaints.

Zeman used his radio interview to claim that Pussy Riot, who were jailed in Russia because of their outspoken views, are not his idea of political prisoners. 

He pointed out the band uses vulgar language in its songs.

Czech prime minister, Bohuslav Sobotka condemned Zeman's interview as undermining the nation's credibility abroad, AFP reported.

He said: 'The president should not speak in such a way as it damages the reputation of the presidency, sets a bad example and does nothing for our reputation abroad.'

It is understood the Czech state media watchdog received hundreds of complaints about the controversial interview, which took place on Sunday.

Zeman was criticised during a recent trip to Beijing when he said Taiwan was part of China. The territory considers itself a separate nation from China, though Beijing insists the island is a rogue province. The standoff is a raw diplomatic nerve around the world.

The centre-left politician denied claims he had attended a public function earlier while under the influence of alcohol, instead blaming his poor performance on that occasion on flu.

So far, Zeman has refused to apologise for any offence caused by his radio interview.

According to the Telegraph, Czech Radio could face a fine of up to £281,000 if it is found to have put at risk 'the moral development of children' with the broadcast. 

However, Zeman's spokesman claimed the president was simply responding to his political opponents 'who tolerate such language'.
