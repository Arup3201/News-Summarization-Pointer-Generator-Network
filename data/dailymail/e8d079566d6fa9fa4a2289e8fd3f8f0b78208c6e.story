A man wanted for 13 years on attempted murder charges in Los Angeles was captured in Colorado after someone called police to report he was urinating on a wall outside a KFC restaurant.

Miguel Sanchez, 59, initially gave officers a false name when he was arrested Wednesday, according to the Colorado Springs Police Department.

After he was fingerprinted, police discovered his identity and that he had a $2 million warrant in California.

Game over: Miguel Sanchez. Sanchez, wanted for 13 years on attempted murder charges in Los Angeles, was captured in Colorado after someone called police to report he was urinating on a wall outside a KFC restaurant.

'Kentucky Fried Chicken called and said he was peeing on the wall,' said Colorado Springs police Lt. Dan Lofgren.

'On the run for 13 years, and then they get caught for being stupid.'

Sanchez is accused of stabbing someone multiple times after an argument in 2000, then stabbing a second person before running away.

Los Angeles police Sgt. Albert Gonzalez said the crime was classified as domestic violence, and that one victim was male and the other female.

He declined to provide more details.

Prosecutors filed four felony charges against Sanchez in 2000: two counts of attempted murder, one count of aggravated mayhem and one count of assault with a deadly weapon, said Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office.
