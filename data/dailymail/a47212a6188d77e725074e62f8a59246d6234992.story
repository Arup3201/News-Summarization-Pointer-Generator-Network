Parliament House was left a little star struck on Wednesday when Chris Hemsworth showed up for a last minute visit. 

The Australian actor met with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to discuss the Australian Childhood Foundation's latest work and appeared to have also had a run in with Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

Hemsworth, an ambassador for the ACF alongside his brother Liam, has been promoting the national charity's latest campaign, the Not Another Child program during his visit.

Australian actor Chris Hemsworth met Prime Minister Tony Abbott at Parliament House on Wednesday 

The CEO of the charity, Joe Tucci, told News.com.au that the star was invited to parliament by Ms Bishop herself, who he ran into at the AFL Grand Final in Melbourne. 

The father-of-three appeared on Channel Seven's Sunrise on Friday where he spoke about the new campaign.

'Unfortunately there's more reports of abuse in Australia than ever before, there's 750 per day last year, which was roughly one every two minutes,' Hemsworth said.

'So we want to put a spotlight on the issue, and make child protection the number one focus for all Australians and the welfare of children our main priority.

The star discussed the latest work of the Australian Childhood Foundation, which he is an ambassador for

'We're asking people - through Facebook, Instagram, Twitter - to share their most memorable childhood experience or photograph with the hashtag #notanotherchild, so we can celebrate what childhood should be about and how lucky we are…but also to think about the kids that, because of the abuse, can't experience that sense of love and joy and belonging.'

The 31-year-old also opened up about how his role in the charity leads him to reflect on his own children in a recent interview on Channel Seven's The Morning Show.

Happy family: The Thor actor spoke about how his own growing family inspired him to get involved in charity work with the Australian Childhood Foundation

'Mum said all you can do is love your kids and make sure they're happy and safe,' he told the program.

'And that's what I try and do: the same thing.

'Having kids makes it all the more poignant and important for me.' 'It's the right of every child to have a safe and nurturing environment to grow up in and unfortunately that's not always the case.

'It's up to all of us as a community, as human beings, to take care of each other but especially kids.'
