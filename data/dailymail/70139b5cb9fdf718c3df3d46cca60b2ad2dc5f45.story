Recall: The Food Standards Agency is warning customers not to eat Tesco¿s own-brand chocolate & nut ice cream cones after painkilling tablets were spotted in two cones

Thousands of ice cream cones are being recalled after painkilling drugs were found in them.

The Food Standards Agency is warning customers not to eat Tesco’s own-brand chocolate and nut ice cream cones after tablets were spotted in two cones.

The supermarket is taking the four-packs off the shelves with sell-by dates up to and including July 2014.

‘As a precautionary measure, we have issued a product recall,’ said a Tesco spokesman.

‘We are urgently investigating this incident with our supplier and ask customers to return this product to their local store.’

A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said: ‘If you have bought the product, do not eat it.

Instead, return it to the store where you bought it for a full refund or contact Tesco customer services on 0800 50 55 55.

‘No other Tesco products are known to be affected.’

The supplier which makes the cones for Tesco is R&R Ice Cream.

The frozen treats are the fourth in a series of products to be recalled by the supermarket giant this year.

In January it asked customers to return its finest Belgian chocolate salted caramel and hazelnut ice cream because the packs had been incorrectly labelled.

They actually contained orange blossom honey and almond ice cream and the error made the product potentially dangerous to nut allergy sufferers.

Later in the year the supermarket’s own-brand yeast extracts were recalled because of a risk of high levels of histamine.

In August, Tesco’s range of ready meals were taken off the shelves because they contained mouldy rice.

Eight products in the Ambient range were affected, including jalfrezi, Szechuan chicken, chilli con carne and tikka masala.
