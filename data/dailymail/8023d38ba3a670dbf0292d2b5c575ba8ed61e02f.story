Eminent psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw, known to TV audiences as Dr. Phil, is on his way to Atlanta, Georgia to help the beleaguered boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina, Daily Mail Online has learned exclusively.

On the eve of Bobbi Kristina’s 22nd birthday yesterday Gordon, whose social media presence had become increasingly desperate and erratic tweeted, “I’m so hurt I wanna do myself in, I know I have to strong [sic].’

In an insight into his spiraling mental state, on Tuesday he tweeted ‘You all blame me but I tried my best and it wasn’t good enough sorry. ‘ Earlier he tweeted the simple plea to Bobbi Kristina, ‘I love you soooooooo much plz wake up.’

Through it all, he has not been allowed to visit with her, as tensions between Gordon and the Brown family have escalated 

On the edge: Nick Gordon was seen on outside North Fulton Hospital near Atlanta, where Bobbi Kristina was first taken after she was found unconscious face down in her bathtub

It is five weeks since Bobbi Kristina was found facedown and unresponsive in a bathtub at the Roswell, Georgia, home she and Gordon, 25, shared.

The only daughter of Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown has been in a medically induced coma ever since the horrific discovery just weeks from the third anniversary of her mother’s death in eerily similar circumstances.

The singer was found dead in a bathtub in her hotel near Los Angeles on 11 February 2012 just hours before she was due to attend a pre Grammy awards party.

But unlike Houston’s death that was ruled accidental, police are treating Bobbi Kristina’s near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 21-year-old as a criminal investigation.

Two weeks after being admitted to Atlanta’s Emory Hospital Bobbi Kristina was taken off her ventilator and had her breathing tube removed for fear of infection. Instead she was given a tracheotomy. But any hopes that this was a sign of her condition improving were dealt a devastating blow the following week when medics attempted to bring her out of her coma only for her to suffer a series of dangerous seizures.

While Bobbi Kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with Gordon, of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident, has emerged.

It was Gordon who found Bobbi Kristina and who was administering CPR when first responders arrived on the scene. But other than this, few details have emerged.

There have been reports that Bobbi Kristina was under the influence of drugs and drinking heavily on the morning that she was found face down and unresponsive in the tub.

In addition to this she had been using cocaine, heroin and Xanax in the months before the January 31 incident according to multiple sources who spoke to People.

Just two weeks ago Gordon was forced to admit that police suspected drugs at the Bobbi Kristina and his Georgia home – a home owned by Houston until her death – as he gave up a legal battle to block law enforcement from obtaining CCTV footage from security cameras located at the Roswell residence.

Lawyers for Gordon had tried to argue that the warrant issued on February 12 was an infringement of their client’s privacy but they subsequently dropped the case.

Meanwhile the nature of Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s union has come under intense scrutiny.

Both have referred to each other as ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ in recent months but there is no evidence to support the assertion that Gordon – who was unofficially adopted into the family by Houston when he was 14 – has married the girl who he once knew as a ‘sister.’ 

In his most recent tweets Gordon who had previously called Bobbi Kristina his ‘wife’ refers to her as his ‘fiancée.’

What is clear is that, in the weeks leading up to the incident that has left Bobbi Kristina fighting for her life, her life had become increasingly chaotic.

Just four days before she was found in the bathtub she was involved in a car wreck when she lost control of her silver Jeep Liberty and drove headlong into a gray Ford Taurus.

The driver of the Ford and a passenger in her Jeep were injured and taken to hospital according to a report from police at Roswell, Georgia.

Gordon too had been involved in crashes and speeding offenses in the past months.

Police were also called to her home on January 23 after reports of a fight there. A security guard at the gated community where Bobbi Kristina lives told a dispatcher that one of her neighbors reported people ‘hitting each other and swinging’ outside the three-bedroom townhouse.

Officers attended the scene but found no signs of an altercation.

Speaking to Daily Mail Online a former boyfriend of Bobbi Kristina who remains a close friend, Zach Jafarzedeh gave an insight into the torrid pair.

He said: ‘Nick has a short temper and Bobbi can be difficult.

‘It was a tug of war, because they are both very stubborn people. Bobbie is very sweet, giving and caring, but she wants all of you, everything.

‘And Nick like space, that’s where a lot of the tension between them came from.’

He revealed that Gordon was ‘getting a little wild.’

He said: ‘He was getting into car accidents. He’s been in about three or four accidents over the last couple of years. He’s got a need for speed. He’s getting these nice cars now the trust fund money is coming in [from Bobbi, sole inheritor of Whitney’s estate] and crashing them life and right.

‘He had a couple of Chevrolet Camaros. He liked fast cars, BMWs, that kind of thing. He cares, but he wasn’t slowing down.’

Against this backdrop, hostilities between Gordon and Bobbi Kristina’s father, Bobby Brown, and other family members have publicly exploded with Gordon an increasingly isolated and ostracized figure.

Gordon has accused Brown of only being after his daughter’s money and he himself has been accused of that very same thing in return.

Bobby Kristina’s aunt Marion ‘Pat’ Houston is the executor Whitney’s estate estimated at between $12 and $20million trust She took out a restraining order against Gordon in March citing aggressive remarks and tweets he had made and claiming that he was only interested in Bobbi Kristina because of her money.

According to Pat the tweets, including one that read ‘Loam I got bigger guns than you. Watch them react to this,’ were specifically aimed at threatening her.

Pat, who was one of Whitney’s managers, has made no secret of her disapproval of Bobbi Kristina and Gordon’s ‘sibling’ relationship having turned into something romantic.

In increasingly erratic tweets Gordon has raged against singer Bobby Brown accusing him of being an absent father who has barely seen his daughter in the past four or five years.

He has claimed that the responsibility for looking after both Whitney, who struggled with drug abuse, and Bobbi Kristina fell on his shoulders and that, now just 25, it was too great a duty to bear.
