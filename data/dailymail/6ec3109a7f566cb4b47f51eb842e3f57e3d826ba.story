Ex-golf coach Andrew Nisbet, 32, has admitted to several of the molestation and murder solicitation accusations against him

A popular California youth golf coach has admitted to molesting three of his male students and attempting to hire a hit man from behind bars to kill some of the victims.

Andrew Nisbet, 32, on Thursday pleaded guilty to three of his child molestation charges, three counts of solicitation of murder and one count of possession of child pornography, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.

The guilty plea comes as part of a deal with Alameda County prosecutors, which will also require him to register as a sex offender for the rest of  his life.

Under the deal, Nisbet will be sentenced to more than 27 years behind bars on Oct. 27, according to the Chronicle. 

The charges he's admitted to are only a handful of the 75 felonies stacked against him for molesting three boys ages 12 to 17.

Prosecutors say he wrote letters from his cell in Santa Rita Jail in Dublin talking about having two of the young men 'taken care of,' court records show.

Nisbet's letters containing information about the alleged victims eventually wound up in the hands of a confidential informant, who told about them to a sheriff's deputy in February.

Alameda County district attorney's Inspector Jeff McCort wrote in an affidavit that Nisbet penned additional letters to the informant acting as an intermediary agreeing on a price for each hit.

An undercover district attorney's inspector visited Nisbet in jail posing as a gun-for-hire and secretly recorded their conversation.

Instructor: Nisbet had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013

The agent described himself to Nisbet
 as a 'mechanic and said he could fix a car for him and made a 
pistol-shooting motion with his hand,'the Chronicle reported.

The admitted pedophile replied by saying that there were two 'cars' that were in need of fixing in Pleasanton and Santa Barbara. One of his victims goes to college near Santa Barbara.

The bogus assassin then asked Nisbet to name the Santa Barbara resident. The former golf coach mouthed the name and said the 'car' was 21 years old.

The Livermore coach suggested to the undercover officer that he should steal the victims' cell phones to make the hits look like robberies.

Nisbet then offered to pay for the hits up front to prove to the 'mechanic' that he was serious.

When officials searched Nisbet's cell a week later, they discovered driving directions to the home of the victim from Pleasanton and a heap of letters written by the suspect to the informant discussing the alleged assassination plot.

Nisbet, who is married, had tutored students at Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore since 2006 and was arrested in December 2013 — just  a day before he was due to receive a PGA award for Coach of the Year at the prestigious Contra Costa Country Club.

Court documents charge Nisbet, who also operated the GRIP Junior Golf Academy, with performing oral sex on his victims in his car from December 2009 through March 2012 and showing them pornography on his phone.

At least one of the victims was as young as 12 when the abuse happened. He also showed the children child pornography, court records show.

Some of the sex acts were committed by Nisbet in the golf clubs parking lot and during out-of-town golfing excursions.

Livermore police officer Steve Goard said that authorities became aware of the allegations when one of Nisbet's golf students reported that he was abused last November. Las Positas Golf Course fired Nisbet at the time of his arrest.

'He befriended them as the cool coach, gave them rides to and from practice and bought them gifts, including top-of-the-line golf equipment,' Goard said to the San Jose Mercury News.

'He created a coach-athlete bond and, as he did, was figuring out who he could get away with it with.'

Nisbet was hauled to jail on Dec. 7, 2013, on the golf course while he was working. During his initial interview, police said he admitted to some lewd acts with the children.

His wife of two years, Kimberly Patrick Nisbet, has not commented on the allegations and appears to have moved out of the family home in Livermore, which is next door to Jackson Elementary School.

According to his biography 
online, Nisbet majored in professional golf management at Mississippi 
State University and had worked as a golf pro at The Country Club of 
Birmingham in Alabama and Beech Woods Golf Course in Southfield, 
Michigan.

It also claims he is 'one of the only Top 50 US Kids Golf Master Teachers in Northern California.'
