Motorist Roger Moore, pictured here on his motorbike, attempted to fake CCTV images to avoid a speeding fine but was caught out by shadows in the footage

A driver who faked CCTV images in an attempt to dodge a speeding fine was caught out by the length of shadows in his forged footage, a court heard.

Roger Moore, 44, was snapped by a speed camera as he drove a garage courtesy car while he own vehicle was undergoing maintenance.

He later took images of his car parked on his driveway which he claimed were taken at the same time - and proved he had returned the courtesy car before the incident.

However, police officers later calculated that the length of shadows in pictures he submitted did not match with that time of year.

Moore, of Plymstock, Devon, has now admitted acting with intent to pervert the course of justice and will be sentenced next year. Plymouth Crown Court heard how he was caught speeding on Billacombe Road in Plymstock at around noon on February 22 last year.

David Gittins, prosecuting, said that only four minutes later he returned the courtesy Peugeot to a nearby garage and picked up his own car.

Legal proceedings began but five months later he submitted footage from a home CCTV system which showed his Mitsubishi Pajero parked on his driveway.

He had forged the time and date of the footage to match that of the speeding offence and claimed someone from the garage must have been at the wheel.

But after studying the film experts 
confirmed it could not have been filmed in February and instead must 
have been filmed in late spring or early summer.

Mr Gittins told the court: 'It was then investigated and found it was a fake.

'[A PC] made further investigations because the shadows were all wrong for that time of year.'

Moore
admitted acting with intent to pervert the course of justice between 
July last year and this January. His case was adjourned for sentencing 
on January 11.

Mr Moore admitted to acting with intent to prevent the course of justice at Plymouth Crown Court, and his case has been adjourned for sentencing until January
