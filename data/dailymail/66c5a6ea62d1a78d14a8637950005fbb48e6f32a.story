Rochelle 'Shelly' Sterling may be ready to let go of husband Donald Sterling, but she has vowed to fight tooth and nail to keep her share of the Los Angeles Clippers despite the NBA saying she would lose her share if he sold the team.

The league issued a statement Sunday that her 50 per cent share of the team would be forfeited if team owners voted to force her husband to sell.

She has repeatedly stated through her attorney and even in an ABC News interview that she would take any battle to retain her half of the team to court if necessary.

'Under the NBA Constitution, if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a three-fourths vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well,' the league statement explained.

'It doesn't matter whether the owners are related as is the case here. These are the rules to which all NBA owners agreed to as a condition of owning their team.'

The philandering racial hatred-spewing owner's wife disagreed, and issued the following reply to the Los Angeles Times through her attorney Pierce O'Donnell.

'We do not agree with the league's self-serving interpretation of its constitution, its application to Shelly Sterling or its validity under these unique circumstances.

'We live in a nation of laws. California law and the United States Constitution trump any such interpretation.'

Her defiant statement came shortly after she told ABC's Barbara Walters that she shouldn't be penalized for her husband's transgressions, and would do everything in her power to keep the team.

'I will fight that decision,' she said, adding the team is her 'passion,' and 'a legacy to my family.

'I've been with the team for 33 years, through the good times and the bad times.'

She also admitted she plans to divorce the disgraced billionaire.

The ABC interview was made public at about the same time Miami Heat forward LeBron James said the entire Sterling family should be banned from the league.

The fiery soon-to-be-ex-wife of the NBA's public enemy number one also suggested he transfer his ownership stake to her name.'

Her lawyer previously said that her legal team 'will fight vigorously to defend her property rights.'

Donald Sterling's interest in the team is likely to be up for grabs after league commissioner Adam Silver banned him for life and fined him $2.5million after recordings of him angrily grumbling racial slurs at his presumed mistress V Stiviano were made public last month.

He told CNN on Sunday that he will do everything in his power to keep control of the Clippers despite the league having already installed an interim CEO to run the team as it charges through the playoffs while trying to claim its first-ever NBA title.
