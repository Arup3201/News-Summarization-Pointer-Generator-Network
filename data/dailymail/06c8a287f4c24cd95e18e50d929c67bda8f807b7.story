Lord Darzi, who suffered from meningitis himself as a child, has slammed the NHS for not introducing a meningitis vaccine, despite it being approved

Former health minister Lord Darzi has condemned the government's two year delay in introducing a vaccine against the last major strain of meningitis because of wrangling over funding.

Britain has one of the highest rates of Meningitis B in the world and campaigners have warned that dozens of lives have needlessly been lost to the disease because of procrastination by officials.

Prof Lord Darzi, who revealed for the first time that he almost died of the disease aged five, has even personally met with Jeremy Hunt, the Health Secretary, to plead with him to introduce the vaccine on the NHS as soon as possible.

He said: 'Every parent should be getting the vaccine through the NHS.'

The Bexsero Meningitis B vaccine was licensed two years ago and a year later it was backed for NHS use by vaccine advisers, who initially declared it would not be cost-effective 'at any price'.

However the Department of Health did not even enter negotiations with the manufacturers Novartis until six months ago. Statistics show one baby dies every month in Britain from Meningitis B.

There has been stalemate over the cost of the jab to the NHS, which has not been revealed. It is available privately at a cost of up to £600 in some areas.

Lord Darzi, who is patron of the charity Meningitis Now, said: 'The government eventually decided to make the vaccine available through the NHS after a significant amount of lobbying from the charity, including myself in visiting the Secretary to State to discuss the matter.

'I think there has been some delays since the announcement by the Secretary of State which are mostly operational. 

'I hope they will be overcome so that the vaccine will be utilised by those in need.'

He said: 'Although I got meningitis at the age of 5, I still remember it was the least pleasant experience but more importantly I am very fortunately and lucky to be alive.

'I believe if the NHS has approved the vaccine, then every parent should be getting the vaccine through the NHS route rather than the costly private alternative.'

It is feared that if agreement cannot be reached soon the process will be further delayed by the General Election.

A U-turn by medical advisers to the Government last March led to routine vaccination being approved for infants and a one-off catch up programme for babies aged three and four months.

Professor John Watson, deputy chief medical officer, said at the time: 'We will be working closely with Novartis in the coming months and, if negotiations are successful, we hope to work with the other UK health departments to introduce a vaccine to prevent meningitis B as quickly as possible.'

The Bexsero Meningitis B vaccine was sanctioned for use two years ago, and approved for NHS use soon after, but health chiefs only entered talks with suppliers six months ago

Meningitis Now has launched a hard hitting TV advert in an attempt to keep the disease in the forefront of ministers' minds.

Founder of the charity, Steve Dayman who lost his baby Spencer to Meningitis B in 1982, said 'I have waited half my life for this vaccine – it's a watershed moment in the fight to eradicate the deadly disease.

'Now is the time to act to save our children – one more lost is another heinous and scandalous injustice.

'On this unwelcome anniversary, I call on Government and the vaccine manufacturer to take advantage of the last window of time before the General Election to do the right thing.'

During the last two years there have been 1,130 cases of Meningitis B, of which at least 452 people died or suffered disabilities.

Many of these would have been avoidable if the vaccine had been introduced immediately after it was licensed.

Mr Dayman added: 'I was sick to my stomach to learn that so many people have died in the two years due to red tape.

'Tragically, in the time, we've heard of and helped numerous families freshly touched by the disease, which prove this lethargic bureaucracy is costing lives and causing disabilities.'

A spokesman for Novartis said 'Novartis Vaccines is currently engaged in a procurement process with the UK Department of Health to agree a price for Bexsero to be included on the National Immunisation Programme.

'Whilst it is not possible to comment on the process, or predict how long it will last, both sides are working to come to an agreement and Novartis Vaccines stands ready to supply Bexsero immediately.

'Unfortunately the confidential nature of this process makes it impossible for Novartis Vaccines to comment further on any elements of the negotiations.'

A Department of Health spokesperson said 'We are very clear that we want to see this vaccine introduced as soon as possible to help protect children from this devastating disease.

'The JCVI (Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation) recommended that a MenB vaccine be introduced, but only at a cost-effective price – below the price published by Novartis. 

'We need to make sure NHS funds are used effectively and negotiations are continuing.'
