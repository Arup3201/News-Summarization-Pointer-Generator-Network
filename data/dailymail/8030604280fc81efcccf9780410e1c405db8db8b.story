Ms Brady's appointment to the upper house comes just five months after she was awarded a CBE for services to entrepreneurship

The Apprentice star Karren Brady has been hired by David Cameron – as a member of the House of Lords.

Ms Brady, 44, who is an  aide to Lord Sugar on the hit BBC television programme, will be handed a Conservative peerage by the Prime Minister later this month, The Mail on Sunday understands.

Mr Cameron hopes  that Ms Brady, who was appointed managing director of Birmingham City Football Club at the age of 23 by the porn baron David Sullivan, and is now vice-chairman of West Ham United, will burnish his credentials among female voters and the business community in the run-up  to the Election.

It will lead to speculation that she could even be handed a junior ministerial position  in time for next May’s poll.

Her appointment to the upper house comes just five months after she was awarded a CBE by Prince William at Buckingham Palace for services to entrepreneurship, and less than a year after she became a Government business ambassador.

Ms Brady will be among about two dozen new peers  to be announced within the next fortnight.

The names of some of the other potential candidates could lead to fresh claims of ‘cash for peerages’ after it was reported yesterday that multi-millionaire Tory donors, including former Marks & Spencer boss Sir Stuart Rose and commodities magnate Michael Farmer, were also in line for elevation.

Sir Stuart, 65, was knighted in 2008. He quit M&S in 2011.

He has attended numerous Tory fundraising events and was tasked by Mr Cameron earlier this year to carry out  a review of ‘culture and performance’ within the NHS.

Sir Stuart immediately angered doctors by saying that GP surgeries should be open at weekends.

In 2009 it was claimed that Mr Cameron’s wife Samantha had asked Sir Stuart, then chief executive of M&S, to secure a £65 limited-edition polka-dot dress sold by the company which had sold out.

After ordering staff to search the company’s 600 UK stores for one of the elusive dresses, he found one that was two sizes too big – but had it tailored to fit and sent to her in time for her to wear it at  the Tory Party conference.

Mr Farmer, 69, is believed to be Mr Cameron’s biggest individual financial backer, estimated to have given more than £5 million to the party.

He made his fortune in the international metal markets, earning the nickname ‘Mr Copper’. He became Tory  co-treasurer alongside Stanley Fink in 2012 after Peter Cruddas resigned in the ‘cash-for-access’ scandal.

The committed Christian’s fortune has been estimated at around £120 million, and he has said that he donates to the Tories because of their views on ‘the family’.

He has three children with wife Jenny. Son George was  a member of Oxford University’s notorious Bullingdon Club.

'Great asset': Karren Brady introducing George Osborne at the Conservative Party Conference last year. Ms Brady¿s peerage was predicted last year by Tory MP and fellow entrepreneur Margot James

In 2010 Mr Farmer said:  ‘You can call me a City fat cat if you want but I’m not giving away my hard-earned money for fun. I’m giving it away because I want to fund something I genuinely  believe: that Cameron and the Tories will be a far better Government for the country than Labour.’

Ms Brady’s peerage was predicted last year by Tory MP and fellow entrepreneur Margot James, who said: ‘She’d be a great asset.Baroness Brady would be  able to make an invaluable contribution to both business and politics. David Cameron should give her a peerage without delay – and she  should accept it.’
