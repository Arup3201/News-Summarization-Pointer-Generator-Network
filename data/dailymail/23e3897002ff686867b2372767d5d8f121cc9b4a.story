It's the first time she has accompanied boyfriend Prince Harry on an official engagement, but Cressida Bonas saw no need to dress up for the occasion.

Wearing jeans and silver Converse high tops, the 24-year-old dance graduate posed for photographers and later leant in for a kiss with her royal beau at Wembley Arena this morning at the launch of the WE Day UK young people's charity event.

Prince Harry, 29, was the star speaker at the 'global youth empowerment' day, with other star billings including singer Ellie Goulding, rap star Dizzee Rascal, and actress Jennifer Hudson.

To wild cheers, he told the audience of 12,000 children: 'Some people do not think it is cool to help others - personally I think it is the coolest thing in the world.

Harry, who began his speech by saying: 'For those of you who were expecting Harry Styles here, I apologise, and no, I am not going to sing' was on stage for 10 minutes.

Admitting to feeling 'extremely privileged and incredibly nervous' to be standing on stage, he said children had the power to effect change.

'Every single one of you has done something amazing to be here today.  It may not feel like it to you, but I can assure you that, collectively, your actions can and will shape the course of our future.'

Harry added: 'The world around us is changing fast. On one hand, it is a much more connected place.

'The internet is now part of our everyday lives, and social media has changed the way we communicate.

'What this means is that our generation, although I am nearly 30, has the greatest opportunity of any in our history to effect change on a global scale.'

Harry told his young audience: 'Sometimes the smallest of things, like helping someone cross the road, to climb a flight of stairs or lift their shopping into a car, really does make a difference. It doesn't cost anything, just a little bit of your time.'

Singer Ellie Goulding gave an energetic performance in front of thousands of young fans at Wembley Arena

Schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in Pakistan for campaigning for a girl's right to be educated, later told the students: 'Your most powerful tool, your most powerful weapon is your voice.'

Recalling the day she was shot, she said: 'I was shot by the Taliban but on that day the little bit of fear that I had died and courage and strength was born.'

US politician Al Gore, actor Clive Owen, entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson and former footballer Gary Neville also made appearances.

Cressida posed alongside her half-sister, Isabella Calthorpe and her husband Sam Branson, and another male friend at the event, organised by the Free The Children charity.

Hosted by MTV presenter Laura Whitmore and attended by 12,000 students and teachers from 400 schools, the event will consist of educational speeches and performances.

Today's WE Day in London is one of several such events organised to encourage children to become 'agents of social change'.

Craig Kielburger, co-founder of Free The Children, said: 'When I was young and wanted to make a difference in the world, I was told I was too young to make a difference.

'We Day provides a platform for young people to learn about local and global issues, take action and celebrate the meaningful contribution they’re making to better our world.'

Other celebrity supporters of the event today include former footballer Gary Neville, and popular singers, The Tenors.

Prince Harry’s girlfriend of more than two years is known for her laidback style.

Not for Cressida the floral frocks and ladylike suits the Duchess of Cambridge loves to wear.

The 25-year-old former dance student champions casual cool and has a far more laid-back attitude to fashion than her fellow Royal WAG - think ripped jeans, beanies and hi-tops for dinner with Harry, not dresses and heels.

Today she embraced the glam-grunge look, pairing black skinny jeans and a leather-trimmed jacket with silver sequined Converse trainers, £60 at Asos (sadly sold out now), that gave her look a lift.
