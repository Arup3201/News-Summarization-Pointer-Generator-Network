Newcastle summer signing Remy Cabella struck two minutes from time as the Toon rescued a 2-2 draw at Championship side Huddersfield in a pre-season friendly.

Daryl Janmaat made his debut for Alan Pardew's side while Facundo Ferreyra also made his first start since joining on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk.

The duo would both play 55 minutes at the John Smith's Stadium against a plucky Terriers side who fielded two different teams for each half.

There were plenty of positives to be taken for Newcastle though, who opened the scoring through another summer acquisition, Emmanuel Riviere.

It was the Frenchman's third pre-season goal since arriving from Monaco.

The Toon opened the scoring in the 16th minute as Remy Cabella and Yoan Gouffran neatly exchanged passes before squaring for Riviere to turn home at the back post.

But the Championship side responded well and levelled the scores 20 minutes later when Radoslaw Majewski collected a low Paul Dixon crosses before turning and slamming home past Tim Krul.

After Huddersfield made 11 changes at the break, Stead turned the game around for the Terriers, collecting a Joe Lolley pass before neatly turning Steven Taylor and firing past Krul in the 66th minute.

But as Newcastle forced the pressure in the final few minutes, Cabella latched on to a quick free-kick from Ayoze Perez before neatly lobbing Joe Murphy to secure a deserved draw.

There was applause across the stadium from fans of both sides in the 17th minute for Newcastle supporters John Alder and Liam Sweeney, who tragically died on flight MH17 last month.
