Frustrated commuters faced fresh travel misery today thanks to a signal failure outside London Waterloo and flooding in tunnels between St Pancras and Farringdon.

Flooding from the burst water main has left Thameslink unable to run any trains between Farringdon and London St Pancras International until at least the end of today’s service.

Thames Water is working to stop the massive leak and Network Rail said it has pumped out more than 300,000 litres of water after the water main ruptured Friday and continued to flood the tunnels over the weekend.

Flooding from a burst main has left Thameslink unable to run trains between Farringdon and St Pancras

Network Rail has pumped out more than 300,000 litres of water since the water main burst on Friday

Thameslink operator Govia said around 50,000 litres of water remained in the tunnel yesterday and full train service will not resume until it is cleared and the safety equipment and infrastructure are inspected.

A reduced service is in place on the Thameslink line, which runs 140 miles from Bedford to Brighton.

Commuters have been forced to switch to buses or alternative train services to get to work as some trips have been delayed by up to an hour.

Thameslink has apologised to passengers for the service disruption which began last week

Meanwhile South West Trains were disrupted through the morning commute due to the signal failure outside London Waterloo, one of the country’s busiest railway stations.

It led to delays for the second Monday in a row. Normal serviced resume at about 10am.

A signalling problem at London Liverpool Street and a broken-down train at Gidea Park also caused delays of up 30 minutes to trains between London Liverpool Street and Shenfield in Essex.

Commuters suffered delays and disruption every day last week because of signalling problems and broken-down trains.

The disruption involving Thameslink trains has put stress on other services and led to additional delays 

Mick Cash, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, said that after last week’s ‘dire failures on Britain’s privatised railways’, there had now been wholesale cancellations on the basket-case Thameslink franchise, leaving thousands of passengers stranded in the cold.

He said: ‘There can be no more excuses from government officials. Their privatised and fragmented rail system leaves the British paying the highest fares in Europe to travel on clapped-out and unreliable services.

‘Two decades of profiteering and under-investment has reduced our railways to chaos.’

A fault affecting live train information across the rail network compounded commuters’ misery, leaving passengers struggling to track services amid the delays.

A signalling problem at London Bridge caused delays of up to 20 minutes to Southern services to and from the station, with no firm estimate of how long the disruption will last.
