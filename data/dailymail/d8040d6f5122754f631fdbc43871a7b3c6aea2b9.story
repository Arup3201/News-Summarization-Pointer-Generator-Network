Mark Lyall-Grant, British ambassador to the U.N, is calling for members of the Security Council to sign a resolution banning the payment of ransoms

Terrorist cell al-Qaeda has made £50million in ransom payments from kidnaps in the last three years, according to the British UN ambassador.

Mark Lyall Grant, the UK Government's representative in New York, revealed the shocking statistic as he attempts to persuade members of the United Nations security council to sign up to a blanket ban on the deals.

His claims were backed up by a top UN diplomat who said that ransom payments were now the biggest source of income for Northern Africa's al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula.

Mr Lyall Grant is now urging member states to sign a resolution which calls on all countries not to pay ransom to kidnappers who use the money to finance terrorist groups.

The Ambassador circulated a draft resolution to the council on Tuesday calling on the 193 nations to 'prevent terrorists from benefiting directly or indirectly from ransom payments.'

A U.N. resolution adopted weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States already bans all countries from financing terrorism.

But Lyall Grant said the proposed new resolution highlights 'the increasing threat' from kidnapping for ransom to benefit terrorists.

He said: 'We want to make it much more difficult for terrorists to benefit from this sort of financing.'

Lyall Grant hopes the Security Council of 15 members will approve the resolution this month.

The British resolution follows up on the communique issued by leaders of eight major industrial powers at their summit in Northern Ireland in June.

The G-8 expressed their concern at 'the increasingly fragmented and geographically diverse threat posed by terrorist groups including al-Qaida and its affiliates' and 'the threat posed by kidnapping for ransom by terrorists.'

While the international community has made 'significant progress in combating the flow of funds to terrorist organizations', the G-8 estimated that al-Qaida-affiliated and other Islamist extremist groups worldwide have collected tens of millions of dollars in ransoms since 2010.

'Payments to terrorists from Sahel to the Horn of Africa helped fuel instability in the region, and contributed to large scale attacks," the communique said.

The G-8 added that ransom money also supports recruitment efforts and improvements in the operational capability of terrorist groups

The leaders of the U.S., Russia, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan said they 'unequivocally reject the payment of ransoms to terrorists'.

Britain have held face-to-face talks with the Syrian Islamist rebels currently embroiled in fighting   Bashar al-Assad.

Included in the meetings were representatives from hardline groups demanding the implementation of Sharia law in the war-torn country.

Representatives from other western nations joined the Brits in the talks which took place in Ankara, Turkey.

The Western allies are closely monitoring the progress of the al Qaeda linked forces who are growing in strength and now have control over large parts of Syria.

They have previously backed the secular Syrian Free Army and are hoping that those rebels can form an alliance with other non-Jihadist factions as they bid to topple the Syrian leader.

But the allies have been reluctant to show their support in the form of funding or the provision of arms, for fear that weapons could fall into the hands of al Qaeda.

The decision to hold talks with hardline Islamist factions marks in approach by Western nation, who have until recently, exclusively dealt with groups who share their opposition to al Qaeda operations.

The G-8 urged the Security Council to consider a new resolution 'to increase international awareness of the threat of kidnapping for ransom, and ... to address and mitigate the threat.'

A U.N. diplomat said there has been an upward trend in the overall number of kidnappings by terrorist groups, and an average of over $2 million is being paid per foreign hostage.

The draft resolution only addresses ransom to finance terrorism - not criminal kidnapping for ransom or piracy for financial purposes.
