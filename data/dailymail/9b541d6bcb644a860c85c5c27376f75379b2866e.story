Joe Launchbury has been ruled out for up to eight weeks with a neck injury, plunging England’s preparations for the autumn Tests at Twickenham into turmoil.

The 23-year-old Wasps lock has been suffering from a persistent neck problem, caused by a nerve irritation, and England have reluctantly had to accept that he will miss the four-match series.

Uncapped Leicester second row Graham Kitchener has been called into the squad to replace Launchbury, while Bath’s Dave Attwood is on course to start alongside Courtney Lawes against New Zealand on Saturday.

The loss of Launchbury was not the only setback ahead of England’s showdown with the world champions. Head coach Stuart Lancaster has also lost Northampton pair Luther Burrell and Stephen Myler with hand and hamstring injuries respectively.

While the impressive form of Attwood is a consolation, the absence of Launchbury will be keenly felt.

He has established himself as a stalwart of the pack while starting his country’s last 20 Tests. When England demolished the All Blacks 38-21 at Twickenham two years ago, the rookie lock was at the vanguard of the breakdown onslaught which paved the way for a historic win. 

Lancaster attempted to strike a philosophical note, saying: ‘It’s obviously disappointing but it’s important for Joe, England and Wasps that he has the appropriate rest and recovery period, and we are confident that he will be back in the New Year.’

His injury has lengthened the casualty list among the front-five forwards. England must take on New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia in the coming weeks without Alex Corbisiero, Dan Cole, Tom Youngs, Mako Vunipola, Geoff Parling, Ed Slater and now Launchbury.

The other area of primary concern is midfield, where Lancaster was already without the heavy-duty threat posed by Manu Tuilagi. Now he will be denied the imposing presence of Burrell, too.

‘Luther has seen the specialist and, while the news is positive that he could be available later in the series, he will stay with the Saints’ medical team this week,’ said the head coach. ‘We will look to bring him into camp further down the line.’

But Burrell is unlikely to come into selection contention until England face Samoa on November 22.

Lancaster is preparing to go into the series opener with Brad Barritt of Saracens restored to the starting XV, in the less-familiar No 13 shirt, and Bath’s Kyle Eastmond at inside centre — as long as he can prove he has fully overcome a rib injury.

Out wide, another of Bath’s turbo-charged back-line, Fijian-born Semesa Rokoduguni, is poised to make his England Test debut against the All Blacks.
