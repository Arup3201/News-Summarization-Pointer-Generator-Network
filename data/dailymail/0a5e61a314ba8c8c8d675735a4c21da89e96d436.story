Liverpool vice-captain Daniel Agger reportedly pleaded with manager Brendan Rodgers to allow him to leave Anfield - and broke down in tears during an emotional one-on-one in the changing room.

The 29-year-old centre-back will likely leave the club for Barcelona, who are chasing a centre-back.

The Mirror report that Agger requested to leave the club during Liverpool's pre-season tour of the US, with the defender airing his desires to hiss manager in the dressing room.

He was consoled by his team-mates after his exchange with Rodgers left him in tears.

It is believed the Dane is available for a price in the region of £12million as the centre-back searches for a club who can offer him regular first-team football.

Agger made just 23 appearances last year for the Reds and he is likely to be pushed even further down the pecking order after the £20m acquisition of Dejan Lovren from Southampton.

In nine seasons on Merseyside, Agger has made 232 appearances, netting on 14 occasions. 

Agger has been capped 64 times for Denmark, scoring an impressive 11 times.
