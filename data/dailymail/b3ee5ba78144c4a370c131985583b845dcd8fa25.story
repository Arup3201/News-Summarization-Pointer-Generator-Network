The Denver Broncos are 11-3 so far this season and likely on their way to the AFC playoffs -- and when you fully understand who the team's quarterback is, it very becomes apparent as to why.

Peyton Manning is widely considered one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL - if not NFL history. And he's often described by teammates as one of the most dedicated. For example, he apparently studies game film while wearing his helmet - in a hot tub.

The photo of Manning wearing his helmet in the hot tub went viral earlier this week, and left some people scratching their heads.

Dedication: Manning isn't crazy, he's listening to play calls in his helmet while studying game film

But Manning's not crazy, he's just dedicated.

'Earlier this season, Manning and tight end Julius Thomas found 
themselves in the training room instead of practice on a Wednesday,' the Broncos' website explains. 'Not wanting to miss out on mental reps, Manning took matters into his own hands.'

The site continues to explain that, 'with
his injured ankle in the cold tub, the quarterback kept his helmet on 
to listen to the play calls from Offensive Coordinator Adam Gase, who 
was on the practice field. Simultaneously, he watched game tape on his 
iPad.

Playoff bound: Manning and the Broncos are 11-3, and likely headed to the NFL playoffs

Despite his dedication, the Broncos lost to the San Diego Chargers on Thursday night for their third loss of the season.

However, it's been an impressive year for the team, and Manning, as the Broncos currently have one of the best records in the league.

As for Manning's younger brother, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning: not so much - Eli and the Giants currently are 5-8, and have little-to-no-shot at making the playoffs.
