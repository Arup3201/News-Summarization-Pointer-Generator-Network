Powerful: It has been reported that Chinese officials threatened to cancel a UK visit by Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang if a meeting with the Queen was not scheduled

Chinese officials threatened to sabotage an important diplomatic trip to Britain by the Communist country's prime minister unless he could meet the Queen, it has been reported.

Chinese officials allegedly told their British counterparts that Li Keqiang - a key player in China's economy - would pull out of next week's visit if a meeting with the monarch was not scheduled.

But if China did take a hard line on the visit, it was successful. Mr Li is set to meet the Queen and David Cameron during the three-day trip.

A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman refused to comment on the matter.

Number 10 also declined to comment on the reports.

However, a government source noted that it is not unprecedented for non-heads of state to meet the Queen, such as when German chancellor Angela Merkel did so in February.

A source, speaking to The Times, said: 'The Chinese are hard negotiators.'

They added that Chinese officials had also pressed British diplomats to find out minutiae of the meetings, such as what style of dress Samantha Cameron will wear when Mr Li and his wife meet the Camerons.

Prime 
Minister David Cameron is forced to walk a tightrope when it comes to 
negotiating with the People's Republic, balancing the trade benefits of friendly
 relations with a growing economic superpower with also keeping them at 
arm's length because of the nation's reported human rights abuses.

In January Xinhua, China's state press agency, reported that China-UK bilateral trade reached a record high in 2013, surpassing £41billion.

Chinese ambassador to the UK Liu Xiaoming said: 'UK's export to China increased by 13.8 percent, much higher than China's other EU trade partners.

'Our relations have come to a fresh start. We face great opportunities that have never been seen before,' said Liu, disclosing that Chinese investment in the UK over the past two years reached nearly £8billion, exceeding the total of the previous three decades.

Meanwhile Amnesty International claims human rights violations are widespread in China. An estimated 500,000 people are currently being detained without charge or trial.

The human rights organisation added that harassment, surveillance, house arrest, and imprisonment of human rights defenders are on the rise, while censorship has grown.

Although Chinese authorities treat official execution statistics as a state secret, Amnesty International estimates thousands are killed every year - more than the rest of the world combined.

Earlier this month there was a string of detentions of artists, lawyers, scholars and journalists ahead of the Tiananmen Square Massacre anniversary amid intense government efforts to deter coverage by foreign media of its remembrance.

China allows no public discussion of the events of June 3-4, 1989, when soldiers backed by tanks and armored personnel carriers fought their way into the heart of Beijing, killing hundreds of unarmed pro-democracy protesters and onlookers.

The government has never issued a complete, formal accounting of the crackdown or the number of casualties.
