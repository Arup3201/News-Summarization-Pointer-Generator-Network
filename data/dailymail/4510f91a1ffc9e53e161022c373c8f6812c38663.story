Shoppers have been warned about the dangers of buying budget car seats online after it was revealed one model was available to buy through Amazon despite failing every single UK safety test.

The Paibi Baby Bear car seat was supplied directly from China but could be bought by UK customers via Amazon, and can be shipped over to this country via several other sites.

That is despite the seat being outlawed for failing all the safety tests required for a seat to be sold in this country, putting children at risk of being killed.

The Paibi Baby Bear car seat was available to buy on Amazon's UK site despite being outlawed in this country for failing every single crash test

Rather than being made from a hard casing like most UK approved car seats, the Paibi seat was made of nothing more than fabric.

It also has four straps attaching it to the car seat, which violates UK regulations stating that every seat must have only one catch to release it so it can be removed from a car quickly after a crash.

In order to be sold in the UK car seats must pass two crash tests, one front-on at 30mph, and another from the rear at 20mph.

Crash dummies are strapped into the seats and sensors are used to measure damage, which must be below certain levels.

Passing such tests will allow a seat to go on sale in this country, but road safety groups will usually carry out additional tests before giving each seat a rating.

A Trading Standards at West Sussex council said: 'Foreign companies with no EU presence are increasingly advertising in the UK and shipping direct to customers.

Rather than a hard casing the Paibi was made only from fabric and is held down by four straps despite regulations stating seats must have a single release strap so they can be removed from cars quickly

'Such companies are incredibly difficult to regulate as they are not subject to UK law.

'We are aware of similar car seats that have been tested and this has shown that they provide totally inadequate protection and I have no doubt that in a car accident there is a strong possibility that any child in one would be killed.'

James McLoughlin, spokesperson for road safety charity Brake, said: 'Child seats are subject to strict safety standards for a reason, and can save a child's life in the event of a crash.

'A child in a sub-standard seat would be at much greater risk of death or injury than if they were in a seat that meets UK safety requirements. 

'We strongly advise parents to buy the safest seat available. Even if it costs a bit more, it's worth every penny to make sure your child is as safe as possible.'
