Usain Bolt is putting in the hard yards ahead of a busy summer on the track as he builds up to the world championships in Beijing, as shown in his latest post of his training regime on social media.

Six-time Olympic champion Bolt posted a glimpse of his training progress at his base in Jamaica on Instagram on Thursday with footage of a block start in slow motion.

Bolt explodes out of the blocks in the baking sun and drives a few steps before slowing up in the post accompanied by an inspiration quote from one of his heroes Mohammad Ali.

'I hated every minute of training, but I said, “Don't quit. Suffer now and live the rest of your life as a champion”,' Bolt’s social media profile said with the vine video.

After missing the majority of last season due to injury, the 100 and 200 metre world record holder is leaving nothing to chance in 2015.

He’s locked in dates in Paris where he’ll run in the 100m on July 4 and the following week at the Athletissima Diamond League in Switzerland where he’ll compete in the 200m.

The later event is one which hold special significance for Bolt who has said he’s keen to attack the elusive 19 second mark – his world mark stands at 19.19.

Bolt posted the video on social media with a quote he could relate to from boxing great Muhammed Ali

In an interview with Sportsmail’s Matt Lawton last month Bolt outlined his aim to become the ‘greatest sportsman ever’ and emulate his heroes including Ali, Michael Jordan and Michael Johnson, whose 200m mark he overtook.

His major target in the short-term is the world championships in Beijing in in August.

But Rio de Janeiro and his bid to win a third consecutive treble in the 100m, 200m and 4x100 relay is the holy grail. Just – and in Bolt’s case it is just – winning a third 100m title would put him in the history books.
