She had probably hoped to be munching on turkey rather than posing as one.

But Raggle the terrier knows — as many of us do — that there are some festive traditions which simply have to be carried out. The turkey costume is just one of the guises in which the rescue dog has appeared on owner Peter Thorpe’s Christmas cards.

Mr Thorpe, 52, a commercial photographer, began the photoshoots with his previous dog, Paddy, in 1990.

Follow that star: Raggle likes dressing as a camel - but she doesn't even get the hump. This was Raggle's first Christmas card guise

Paddy was dressed up in antlers and a red nose for a card that Mr Thorpe sent to his clients. They enjoyed it, asked what next year’s would be . . . and the tradition was born.

In subsequent years, Paddy became a fairy on top of the Christmas tree and a choirboy.

Sadly, Paddy died in 2002 at the grand old age of 17. But Mr Thorpe and his wife Julie, also 52, adopted Raggle, who has been the star of the cards since 2006.

First she was a camel, then — with a little help from a pair of modified bunny ears and a tennis ball nose — a donkey. What Mr Thorpe calls the ‘dog roast’ came next. 

‘I made the oval platter from MDF, cut a hole in the middle and filled it with towelling so it was comfortable for Raggle to lie on, then placed the turkey on top of her,’ explained Mr Thorpe, who spends around a fortnight planning and making each set, and takes all the photos in his studio in Bristol.

‘I thought this may be impossible but Raggle is a true star. She is a very sweet and gentle dog, and is very happy to be dressed briefly for the photos.

‘We don’t make her do anything she doesn’t like. And she always gets a treat afterwards.’  

Since then, Raggle has been a lamb perched on ‘shepherd’ Mr Thorpe’s shoulders, a penguin on an iceberg, and even posed as Ebenezer Scrooge.

Mrs Thorpe helps set up the shots, and the couple’s children — twins Joe and Callum, 21, and Toby, 18 — have also featured on cards over the years.

For her latest — and last — shoot, Raggle, who is thought to be 15, became a mouse sitting beside a giant mousetrap and gazing at the Christmas pudding bait.

Mr Thorpe said: ‘This will be her final performance before her retirement due to old age. She still responds very well to tasty food so we lifted her on to the set for just a few minutes.'
