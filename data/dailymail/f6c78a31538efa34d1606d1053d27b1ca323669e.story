Doubt has been cast on Bill Shorten's selection as Labor leader amid reports that the mailing addresses for dozens of ballot papers were changed before the leadership vote.

According to Fairfax Media, an ALP tribunal decision found 50 members' addresses were altered following a request from Kaila Murnain, who was a staff member of Senator Sam Dastyari.

At least 20 were changed to the address of Auburn councillor Hicham Zraika, who on Monday was suspended after being found to have engaged in 'unworthy conduct', including branch stacking.

Doubt cast on Bill Shorten's selection as Labor leader amid reports ballot papers were sent to wrong address

The tribunal found Mr Zraika should have alerted the party when he received the ballot papers destined for other party members 'because it was necessary to preserve the integrity of the [federal Labor] leadership ballot'.

'If in fact he had no prior knowledge of the change in address, the arrival of more than 20 ballot papers must have been quite alarming,' the tribunal said. 

Party members are understood to be concerned that the case is not a one-off.

Senator Dastyari's former staffer Ms Murnain is now NSW Labor assistant general secretary.

Ms Murnain is now NSW Labor assistant general secretary, but was a staffer of Senator Sam Dastyari 

She said the changes were 'in accordance with party rules' and occurred during a busy membership renewal period.

Mr Shorten was elected leader in October, 2013, after beating Anthony Albanese in a 55-31 caucus vote.

He earlier lost a wider membership vote, which backed Mr Albanese 60-40 per cent.
