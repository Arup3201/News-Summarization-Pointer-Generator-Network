The American woman accused of drugging and bashing her husband to death in Hong Kong eleven years ago says she has no regrets over the murder in her first ever media interview.

Nancy Kissel, now 50, has been convicted twice of the 2003 murder of her banker husband Robert who worked for first Merrill Lynch and then Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong.

In April, a three-judge panel at the Court of Final Appeal in Hong Kong rejected the mother-of-three’s final bid for an appeal and told her she had exhausted all appeal avenues.

‘I can’t spend my time explaining the unexplainable. I can’t undo something I never understood,’ she told Bloomberg in an interview carried out via an intercom at her maximum security prison in Hong Kong.

Kissel and her three children had moved from New York to Hong Kong in 1998 when her husband took a top banking job that afforded them a luxury lifestyle including a $20,000 a month ocean view apartment.

But their outwardly perfect life came crashing down in 2003 she gave her husband a sedative-laced milkshake and bludgeoned him with an eight-pound metal statuette.

Police discovered the body, that she'd wrapped up in a carpet, only after his colleague filed a missing persons report.

The case, dubbed the ‘Milkshake Murder,’ grabbed world headlines with its lurid tale of the breakdown of a wealthy expatriate marriage in the southern Chinese financial hub.

Throughout her prolonged court battles, Kissel’s defense argued she was suffering from clinical depression and was acting under diminished responsibility.

During her recent interview, Kissel switches between giving coherent answers, breaking into song and speaking incomprehensibly.

The couple’s children – a son and two daughters – were sent to live with Robert’s sister, Jane Clayton, near Seattle, Washington, after their father’s death.

Kissel said she has hardly seen them since then.

‘My children are there and they need to heal from something they won’t ever understand,’ she said.

When asked why she didn’t take her husband up on his offer for a divorce on the night of his death, Kissel said that pretending to be brave doesn’t always work.

‘You need to find your identity, and I’m still trying. Hiding behind luxury is easy. That way no-one has to ask if everything is alright. And no-one ever did.’
