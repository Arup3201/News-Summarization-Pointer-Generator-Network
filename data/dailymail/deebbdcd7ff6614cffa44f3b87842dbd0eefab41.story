It was revealed that a virus forced Tyson Fury to miss his last three weeks of training, but it was the fans who caught a bad cold on a fog-shrouded Saturday night in London’s Docklands.

Fury climbed from his sickbed in time to reduce Dereck Chisora’s face to something out of pulp fiction with his telescopic jab and thereby move into line to challenge dominant world heavyweight Wladimir Klitschko next year.

When, and if, that happens it will be a sight worth seeing. So hopefully it will take place before thousands of those watching have left.

Fury lands an uppercut on his way to a decisive victory over Chisora 

ExCel sounds like a prescription drug but there was no easy remedy for the public as a rousing evening of boxing in that arena yawned on into the early hours of Sunday.

Those without cars faced a choice: make a dash for the last train back to town before the main event even started, or stay in their seats to get their money’s worth before emerging into the dank and the dark to join long queues for infrequent night buses or wander deserted byways hoping to hitch a lift.

They could walk for hours to the nearest quarter of the City where taxis might still have been operating.

Grim choices for ticket buyers. Especially those in stiletto heels and micro dresses. These over- running shows are becoming as epidemic as flu in winter. Last weekend in Liverpool, Tony Bellew and Nathan Cleverly lumbered on until after midnight. Fury and Chisora were supposed to be in the ring by 11pm but did not touch gloves until 12.40am.

Those in the sell-out crowd of 15,700 who were anxious to catch that last train just about made it by scarpering the moment the judges of the preceding bout awarded their split decision to Billy Joe Saunders over Chris Eubank Jnr. At least they had seen the fight of the night. But no-one is more conscious than promoter Frank Warren that they will think twice about going next time if tarrying until the climax means you cannot get home before dawn.

Having lived up to his promise of a good night’s sport, he departed vowing to ‘put a curfew on the finishing time in future’.

Some will be saying that those who missed Fury spearing Chisora with his switch-hitting jabs until he resembled a gargoyle were the lucky ones.

Peter Fury, the gypsy giant’s trainer and uncle, let us in on the secret of his nephew’s pre-fight ailment, saying: ‘Tyson was weakened but would not pull out.’

From the first bell, Fury was on top with Chisora failing to land a decisive blow over the 10 rounds

That reinforced their decision to minimise risk, especially with a prize as rich as a mandatory position as Klitschko’s challenger at stake. Uncle Peter praised his young nephew for ‘having the maturity to be patient against a man who will always be dangerous if you give him the chance’.

Some of those still in attendance grew restless as Fury used his 6ft 9in height to lean back out of Chisora’s range and his long reach to gradually disfigure his opponent’s features.

It was not a performance to cause Klitschko any loss of sleep as the rest of us trudged home but it forced the stoppage of a hard man who was in better shape than when he took Fury the distance in their first fight three years ago.

With Chisora’s eyes swollen to near-closing point his corner convened a medical consultation at the end of the 10th. Warren instructed them to pull him out.

Chisora had not won a round and Warren said: ‘No boxer likes to be retired. Least of all in a fight this important. Dereck was not happy. But by then he had no chance of winning and there was no point him taking further punishment.’

The boos had been growing louder but Peter Fury said: ‘Some people with a lot of booze only want a slug-fest. We are interested in bringing the world heavyweight title back to Britain and Tyson will do that. He has phenomenal talent and until now we’ve only been scratching the surface. He’ll be ready for Klitschko next year.’

Warren said: ‘That will be a huge stadium fight and we’ll do all we can to get it over here.’

That will have to wait until Klitschko is given his chance to add the only world title missing from his collection, the WBC belt soon to be contested by Deontay Wilder and Bermane Stiverne.

Klitschko is expected to meet the winner in the spring, while Fury will keep busy against a top-15 opponent on Warren’s February 28 promotion at London’s O2 Arena.

Assuming there are no nasty surprises, the Ukrainian and the Mancunian should meet next August or September.

Saunders opened the door to his own world middleweight title shot by surviving a gladiator comeback by the powerful son of a fabled father. Chris Eubank Snr stood erect and absorbed while Junior failed to win any of the first six rounds as the experience and technical skills of Saunders taught him a lesson.

But the lad is a quick learner. He turned it into a rough-house in the second half of the fight, clawed back some of the deficit and forced Saunders to dig deep to survive a storming finish.

It ended with Eubank still 117-112 behind on my card but the judges called a close split decision. This came a fight or two too early for Eubank but stars can be born in thrilling defeats and by the time this rivalry blossoms into a rematch, the outcome could be different.

But that is on hold while Saunders chases his dream. Fury has long hoped to become the first member of the travelling community to win a world title but Saunders may beat him to it.

Billy Joe is now the mandatory challenger for the winner of next month’s fight for the WBO middleweight belt between Matt Korobov and Ireland’s Andy Lee.

Saunders should get his shot in March or April and again Warren will strive to bring his man home advantage — but before the witching hour, if you please.

By the time I had finished working and negotiated a plague of roadworks, I was opening my front door in London at a quarter-to-four in the morning.

But then I am paid to do this, not forking out hard-earned cash for the very dubious privilege of being stranded in the dead of night.
