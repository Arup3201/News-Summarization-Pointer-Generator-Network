A morbidly obese cat named Little Dude has passed away before he could be put up for adoption.

The 10-year-old feline, who weighed three times a normal cat, had moved  to a foster home in Costa Mesa, California  last week as veterinarians tried to get his weight down.

But on Saturday, he passed away in an animal hospital in Orange County after he 'succumbed to his sheer size' and the stresses of his life changes, shelter staff said.

'My heart is absolutely broken right now,'  his foster mother, Angela Jackson-Brunning wrote on Saturday night on a Facebook page set up to chart his progress.

Loved: Vets hoped to get the 10-year-old cat's weight down from 36 pounds so he could be adopted

Obese: When he was taken to the shelter last month, he was so large that he could barely walk, staff said

'It is with tremendous sadness I must tell you all that our precious Little Dude has peacefully slipped away while in the arms of love... Please know we did everything humanly possible to help him.'

Little Dude weighed 36 pounds when he was taken to WAGS Pet Adoption, a no-kill shelter in Westminster, in August after his owners could no longer afford him, NBC reported.

When he arrived, he was barely unable to walk and handlers put him on a strict diet.

But Little Dude did not enjoy the diet food and stopped eating altogether, WAGS reported on its website. It meant that he needed a feeding tube to make sure he got enough nutrients.

He is believed to have got down to about 31 pounds, the LA Times reported.  

But despite his progress, staff said he was stressed by the changes in his life.

Care: He was put on a strict diet but then refused to eat - requiring him to be fitted with feeding tubes

Struggles: Shelter staff believe changes in his lifestyle put stress on his already weak and aging body

'Our doctors feel that he succumbed to the sheer size of him,' Cortney Dorney, the shelter manager at WAGS told NBC. 'It was really difficult for him to breathe and the stress of being displaced from his home is pretty common for adult cats - and he was a senior cat.'

Thousands of people had 'liked' Little Dude's Facebook page after his story made headlines, and fans flocked to the site to express their condolences.

Posts on Facebook and Reddit had sparked donations from as far as way as Germany. 

'I have no regrets and I'm certain LD would say he was pleased to be genuinely loved and adored by so many worldwide,' Jackson-Brunning wrote.

'Little Dude was a treasure. A beautiful, precious, invaluable gem. I have never known a soul like him and I doubt I ever will. I am so blessed to have been his foster mom.'
