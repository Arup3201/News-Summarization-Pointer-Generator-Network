GPs will be paid £55 for every patient diagnosed with dementia under a controversial scheme to boost detection.

It is being rolled out by the NHS over concerns that family doctors are picking up less than half of all cases.

But leading GPs have branded the incentives unethical and say they will lead to patients being wrongly diagnosed and suffering needless anxiety.

Undetected: GPs will be paid an incentive of £55 for patients diagnosed with dementia (picture posed by model)

Around 850,000 patients in Britain are thought to have dementia but only 45 per cent have had a formal diagnosis.

This has partly been blamed on an attitude of fatalism among doctors and patients who assume the diagnosis is pointless as so little can be done.

But Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has called the situation ‘shocking’ and pledged to increase diagnosis rates to two-thirds by next year. NHS officials suspect this target is unreachable and are resorting to paying practices £55 for every patient diagnosed over the next five months.

The incentives – uncovered by Pulse magazine – will see practices given the extra money depending on how many more patients are on their dementia register in March, compared to September just gone.

It will be up to doctors how they spend this money and to either put it towards salaries or general running costs.

But Dr Martin Brunet, a GP from Guildford, Surrey, said it could potentially lead to doctors misdiagnosing patients. He also warned it may result in patients with very unlikely symptoms and their families having to go through the ordeal of rounds of dementia screening just in case.

‘We need to think very carefully about this as it crosses a line that has not been crossed before – the direct payment on the basis of making a diagnosis – ‘‘cash for diagnoses’’,’ he said.

‘Patients are at their most vulnerable when we make a diagnosis, because it is the doctor’s judgment and so very difficult for the patient to challenge it.

'The payment is not on the basis of caring for our patients, but only the diagnostic label we apply – this creates a major conflict of interests that is frankly unethical.’

Dr Iona Heath, former president of the Royal College of GPs who practises in North London, said: ‘I think the proposal is an intellectual and ethical travesty.’

Charities warned that the payments would only partly solve the problem as many patients with dementia are too frightened to make a GP appointment.

George McNamara, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: ‘Any step towards improving diagnosis is a good thing. However, a focus on enhanced payments is only part of the answer.

‘We know some doctors are reluctant to give a diagnosis because they know the right help and support isn’t available locally.

‘It’s absolutely vital that every person with dementia understands what is happening to them and has access to the help they need afterwards.’

Last month the head of the NHS, Simon Stevens, urged GPs to diagnose more patients with dementia, saying it was their ‘basic human right’ to know.

He warned that there was an ‘attitude of fatalism’ about dementia in the NHS – and society – with patients and doctors thinking nothing could be done.

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘More needs to be done to ensure that people living with dementia are identified so that they can get the care they need. This additional investment is part of a drive to ensure this.’
