Attacker: The E-Fit portrait of the man which was put together by his 12-year-old victim

This is the face of a man wanted by police for raping a schoolgirl as she played in a park near her home.

The 12-year-old child helped a police specialist put together electronically the distinctive image of the rapist who is believed to be about 45 years old.

He struck in a play park where the victim was alone and raped her in adjoining woodland.

A senior detective said last night: 
'I urge anyone who recognises the description or the man in this picture
or who has any information on the incident, to get in touch 
immediately.'

The girl was raped alongside the play park in Harrowden, near Bradville, Milton Keynes, Bucks.

A
spokesman for Thames Valley Police said that the incident happened 
between 2.50pm and 3.30pm in woodland at the end of a play park in 
Harrowden.

'The victim, a 
12-year-old girl, had been on her own in the play park when she was 
sexually assaulted in an area close to the park after which the offender
fled.'

Detective 
Inspector Phil Hayes, in charge of the probe, said: 'The man we want to 
speak to is white, tanned, around 6ft 3ins tall and of skinny build.

'He was aged around 45, wearing a 
black leather jacket, blue jeans and Dr Martens-style boots. It is 
believed he spoke with a Scottish accent, had a cut to his lip and had 
black shaved hair with flecks of grey.

'We take all allegations of a sexual nature very seriously and we are continuing to investigate this report fully.'

Just
hours after detectives issued the image they were called to a new 
incident in which a schoolgirl was attacked on a bridge and sexually 
assaulted.

The
latest incident happened at 7.30 in the morning as the girl was walking
over the bridge towards Avebury Boulevard, Milton, Keynes, Bucks.

Police said that she was pushed over and then molested by a man wearing boots with steel toecaps.

It was not yet known whether the same man was responsible for both incidents.
