Eleven middle school students and their driver were injured when their school bus jumped a curb Thursday and rammed into trees in Southern California, authorities said.

Three of the injured — the driver and two of the students— were taken to hospitals in critical condition after the 3.30pm accident, Anaheim police Lt. Bob Dunn said.

The other nine young victims sustained minor injuries, and most of them were released to their parents.

Dramatic scene: Firefighters extricate the driver from the front
 of a school bus that crashed Thursday in Anaheim, 
California, leaving three people in critical condition, among them two children

Local news reports showed the Orange 
Unified School District bus tilted sideways and leaning against a tree 
on a roadside embankment next to Anaheim Hills Golf Course.

The driver was trapped inside the bus and it took firefighters up to 20 minutes to extricate him before he was taken to the hospital.

The bus was taking students home from an after-school activity at El Rancho Charter Middle School in Anaheim when it crashed, said a statement from Michael L. Christensen, superintendent of the Orange Unified School District.

Jak Pintches, 14, said the bus went off the road during a turn and hit a tree and a lamp post.

'I flew out of my seat and hit the other side of the bus' and injured his back, the teenager told the Orange County Register.

Part of a tree went into the bus and cut a girl on the leg, he said.

Chaotic scene: Several scraped and bloodied students were seen hanging out of the bus' windows and yelling for help from passing drivers

After the crash, someone ran up and told everyone to get off because the bus was leaking gasoline, he said.

Witness Andrea Shurtz, one of many people driving nearby who saw the crash, said the bus was going very fast when it hit a curb and appeared to go airborne.

'It came flying down the hill,' Shurtz told KABC-TV, 'and took out trees along the way.'

Shurtz said the driver and several students were hanging out of the bus's windows and yelling for help from passing drivers.

'Kids were screaming. Gas was pouring out the back,' Shurtz said. 'People just came running from everywhere.'

Good Samaritans who rushed to the victims' aid observed that some of the children were bloodied and bruised.

The bus was equipped with seat belts, police said, but it wasn't clear how many of the students were wearing them at the time of the crash.

Aftermath: Three of the injured ¿ the driver and two of the students¿ were taken to hospitals in critical condition

The father of the injured driver, whose name has not been released, told CBS Los Angeles that his son always made sure that children were secured in their seats.

But some of the passengers admitted that they had unfastened the seat belts during the trip.

The driver has been a full-time driver for the Orange Unified School District since October 2010.

The California Highway Patrol will take over the investigation. There is no immediate word on the cause, but investigators do not believe that another vehicle was involved in the collision.

The crash took place in Anaheim Hills, an affluent community within the city of Anaheim about 10 miles east of Disneyland and 30 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.
