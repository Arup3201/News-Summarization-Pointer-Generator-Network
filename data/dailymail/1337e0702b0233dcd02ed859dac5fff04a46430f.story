A woman who suffered a heart attack had to be carried out of her bedroom window using a crane.

Joan Smith, 78, had collapsed 
upstairs at her home but each time paramedics tried to carry her 
downstairs on a stretcher, her heart stopped.

Realising she had to be kept level to
give her any chance of survival, they decided the only way to move her 
to the ambulance was to use an aerial ladder platform.

Being in an upright position affect blood pressure in some people.

Fire crews arrived to manoeuvre the crane into place and Mrs Smith, from Hull, was carried 
out of the window on to the platform before being lowered to the ground.

During the process, Mrs Smith had to be resuscitated twice as paramedics struggled to keep her alive.

Mrs Smith's husband Brian said: 'Without doubt, the emergency crews saved my wife's life. They were absolutely marvellous and I couldn't ask for more from them.

He said: 'I went upstairs 
and I just heard this thud. I called 999 straight away. Joan was looking straight at me but she wasn't seeing me.

'When the paramedics arrived, they had to keep her horizontal, which meant they couldn't get her down the stairs.

'They had to call the fire service to help and used an aerial platform to lower her down horizontally.

Mrs Smith's husband Brian said: 'Without doubt, the emergency crews saved my wife's life. They were absolutely marvellous and I couldn't ask for more from them'

Mrs Smith is still in hospital and is expected to have a pacemaker fitted

'Joan hardly had a heartbeat and when they finally got 
her out, it was a mad rush to the hospital.'

Crowds had gathered in the street below to watch as the emergency crews battle to get Mrs Smith into the waiting ambulance.

Once at hospital, doctors eventually managed to get a line in through Mrs Smith's neck to her heart to keep the blood pumping.

She was expected to have an operation yesterday to fit a pacemaker.

Steve Johnson, clinical supervisor at Yorkshire Ambulance Service, oversaw the operation. He said: 'The woman suffered a life-threatening illness which made it very difficult.

'The first crews on the scene stabilised her. But it soon became apparent that, due to the patient's critical condition, we needed to keep her as flat as possible.'
