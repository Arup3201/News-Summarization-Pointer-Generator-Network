As summer arrives and sleeveless dresses hit the shops, many women will look mournfully at their less-than-toned arms.

It is, therefore, possibly no surprise that plastic surgery to reshape the upper arm is soaring in popularity.

The latest statistics released by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) show that arm lifts in women have rocketed more than 4,000 per cent in the last decade.

Michelle Obama's toned arms are thought to be inspiring people to undergo arm lift procedures

The report says that the trend is fuelled, in part, by sleeveless fashions and more focus on strong-armed celebrities.

In 2000, more than 300 women had upper arm lift procedures in America. Last year, more than 15,000 did.

Brachioplasty is a procedure to remove excess skin and fatty tissue from the upper arm.

It is normally carried out under general anaesthetic and involves a cut being made from the elbow up to the armpit.

This allows for the removal of the excess tissue meaning that the circumference of the arm reduces.

The procedure leaves a thin scar along the inside of the arm.

Complications involve persistent swelling of the arm, infection, bruising and bleeding.

There can also be nerve damage which causes numbness in the arm.

Upper arm lifts can include liposuction or a surgical procedure known as brachioplasty, in which loose skin is removed from the back of the arms.

‘Women are paying more attention to their arms in general and are becoming more aware of options to treat this area,’ said ASPS President Gregory Evans.

‘For some women, the arms have always been a troublesome area and, along with proper diet and exercise, liposuction can help refine them.

‘Others may opt for a brachioplasty when there is a fair amount of loose skin present with minimal elasticity.’

Doctors say there is no single reason behind the increase, though celebrities from the White House to the red carpet may be having an influence.

A recent poll conducted on behalf of ASPS found that women are paying closer attention to the arms of female celebrities.

According to the poll, women most admire the arms of first lady Michelle Obama, followed closely by Jennifer Aniston.

Actresses Jessica Biel and Demi Moore, and daytime TV talk show host Kelly Ripa, were also recognised for their toned arms.

‘I think we are always affected by the people that we see consistently, either on the big screen or on TV,’ said ASPS Public Education Committee Chair David Reath.

‘We see them and think, “yeah, I'd like to look like that”.’

That is what happened to 24-year-old Natalie Robinson of Knoxville, who says she was inspired by the arms of the first lady.

‘I looked at Michelle Obama and said “Oh my gosh, I want her arms”. When I first started losing weight and started to tone up, I had her image in my head.’

That was three years ago. Today, Ms Robinson has lost more than 12 stone and continues an amazing transformation through diet and exercise.

However, despite losing so much weight, Ms Robinson says she still was not entirely happy.

‘I had a lot of excessive skin around my upper arms,’ she said. ‘Every time I looked in the mirror there was a reminder of a heavier person and I just couldn't get rid of it.’

As a result, Ms Robinson contacted Dr Reath, who performed a brachioplasty.

‘Natalie had the perfect arms for this procedure,’ said Dr Reath, ‘but it's not for everybody.’

In
2012, 15,457 people in the U.S. had an arm lift. This was an increase 
of three per cent since 2011 and 4,473 per cent since 2000.

Of those patients, 15,136 were women.

The surgery is most popular with patients over 40.

The majority, 43 per cent, of patients were aged between 40 and 54, 33 per cent were over 55.

The average cost of the operation was £2,500.

A brachioplasty requires an incision from the elbow to the armpit, generally on the back of the arm, leaving a visible and permanent scar.

For Ms Robinson, the scar was much easier to deal with than the excessive skin, but Dr Reath warns patients to carefully consider the pros and cons before having an upper arm lift, particularly a brachioplasty.

‘It's a trade-off. We get rid of the skin, but we leave a scar,’ he said. ‘So, as long as there's enough improvement to be made in the shape of the arm to justify the scar, then it's a great procedure.’

Dr Reath stresses the importance of proper diet and exercise as part of a healthy lifestyle to all his patients, but says some women simply cannot achieve the look they want on their own.

Many who simply want to tighten and tone their upper arms, but don't have a lot of excess skin, opt for liposuction instead of a brachioplasty.

‘We are genetically programmed to have different accumulations of fat in different areas, and for some women the arms can be a problem area,’ said Dr Reath. ‘The arms are a very noticeable area and if excessive fat and skin are an issue, they tend to look more out of proportion than the rest of the body.’

That was certainly the case for Ms Robinson, but not anymore.

She says she never expected surgery to make her arms perfect, just more normal.

‘Well-proportioned is what I was going for, and I'm very happy. It was well worth the investment,’ she said. ‘I would do it again.’
