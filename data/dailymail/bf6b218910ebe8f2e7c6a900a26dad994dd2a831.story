Photographs of celebrities captured in informal moments by the artist Andy Warhol are to be seen by the public for the first time.

The American pop artist focused on photography towards the end of his career and took pictures of his famous friends in candid and spontaneous moments.

Many of his subjects were showbusiness friends who visited his luxurious beach house or his New York studio known as The Factory.

Now the exhibit I'll Be Your Mirror will show superstars like John Lennon, Mick Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor, Madonna, Sting, Bruce Springsteen, Liza Minnelli, Diana Ross and Debbie Harry.

These never-before-seen photographs of celebrities captured by Andy Warhol are about to become and exhibition. This 1979 picture shows John Lennon and the boyfriend of fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick, known as Halston

Warhol's shot of Lennon was taken in New York in 1979, a year before he was murdered, and shows the boyfriend of fashion designer Roy Halston Frowick, known as Halston, poking his tongue out behind the Beatle.

Warhol also turned his artistic eye to capturing domestic items and hum-drum objects like a room service tray and, bizarrely, a row of toilet urinals.

The body of work also includes a number of self-portraits, including one of him wearing a green jumper and eating a bowl of cornflakes.

Warhol, who died in 1987, only ever made one print of each of his photos, so they are unique works of art.

Sting, formerly of The Police. Warhol, who died in 1987, only ever made one print of each of his photos, so they are unique works of art.

He gave many of them to his long-time diarist, Pat Hackett, and they will now be exhibited and sold. They will go on general sale at the online art and antiqe dealers 1stdibs.com and will cost up to Â£5,000 pounds for a print.

Miss Hackett said: 'Andy had an artist's eye and everything that he did he applied it to.

'He would see odd things that he would photograph, his skill was deciding what you want to photograph. Photography was something the next phase of his art career and was something that Andy was progressing with much more.

'I am selling these photos now because Andy died before he was able to present them to a wider public. They haven't been given the attention that Andy would have expected.

'When his life was cut short that awareness of his photography was cut short, too.'

The silver gelatin prints were taken on a 35mm negatives films between 1976 to 1987.

Some of the prints being sold are owned by Warhol collector Jim Hedges, 45.

Mr Hodges said: 'Warhol obsessively photographed different subjects. That was part of the genius of Andy Warhol.

'He conveyed in his art the highest of the highs, like show business people, and the lowest of the lows, like a urinal. This is fresh material and gives a new light on Andy Warhol's work.'

The exhibition will open at the New York Design Center from September 3.
