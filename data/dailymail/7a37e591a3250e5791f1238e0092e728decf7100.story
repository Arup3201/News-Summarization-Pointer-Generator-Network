When it comes to livening up a presentation, pointing a gun at your audience is perhaps taking matters a bit far.

After all, you want those listening to be interested, not scared witless.

It is advice that it seems the homeland security director of New York should heed, because he reportedly used the laser sighting on a handgun to aid a presentation he gave last year and left several officials feeling distinctly uneasy.

Controversial: Jerome Hauer, pictured during a different presentation, allegedly used a handgun laser sight to point at a map

Sight to behold: Hauer rattled officials as the laser swept across their heads, eyewitnesses said

Jerome Hauer was giving a talk at the state police headquarters in Albany on October 24 to foreign officials when he drew out a handgun and used the laser sighting to point to a map of New York, according to the Times Union.

In the process, an eyewitness told the paper, he moved the barrel across the heads of three Swedish emergency managers, who were said to be rather shaken by the experience.

Two people quickly moved out of the way, another witness said.

The briefing was about the stateâ€™s response to Superstorm Sandy.

But now Mr Hauer, who is said to frequently carry a 9mm Glock handgun, has caused a storm of his own.

Mr Hauer admitted that using the gun was an error of judgement, but denied that he swept it across anyone.

He told MailOnline: 'This was an unloaded gun. It was never pointed at anyone. No one was rattled. It was pointed at a wall. It was a mistake to use it.'
