This is the idyllic garden bridge that Londoners could one day be able to cross for a moment of calm in the heart of Europe's busiest city.

The leafy walkway, packed with flower beds and trees, was first suggested by actress Joanna Lumley following Princess Diana's death as far back as 1997.

But now a new public consultation has been launched meaning the bridge could open as soon as 2016, providing a new river crossing from Temple  to the South Bank.

Groundbreaking: Consultation opened today for Londoners to give their say on 370-ft aerial oasis actress Joanna Lumley thought up in 1997

To mark the occasion, a new image of the 370-ft landmark has been released for Londoners to have a look at.  The consultation will ask for verdicts on every little detail including the colour, the shape, the location, and whether dogs can be allowed on.

It would be the first new crossing over the Thames since the 'wobbly' Millennium Bridge opened in 2002 and London's answer to New York's High Line, where a disused train line has been transformed into a lush aerial park.

It would also give stunning views 
along the river of St Paul's Cathedral and the City of London to the 
east.

With lauded architect Thomas Heatherwick CBE at the helm, famed for his Olympic cauldron for London 2012, everyone from George Osborne to New York mayor Michael Bloomberg have weighed in to show their support.

According to Boris Johnson, it could 
be the iconic piece of green infrastructure that he has been looking for
to give London a high-quality image.

Designer
and Horticulturalist Dan Pearson, appointed to oversee the gardening 
side of things, has also attracted interest from politicians and donors.

According to the Garden Bridge Trust, the crossing will have trees, plants and even 'intimate walkways', as well as a direct link between the Southbank and Soho

The project, which is being developed with engineering firm Arup, will go ahead only if Heatherwick can raise money from private backers and will not receive public funds.

A trust, set up to oversee the construction, is currently in the process of seeking charitable status, but private donors are said to have offered to foot almost half the bill already.

Desperate to make sure the structure does
become a reality, Heatherwick has drawn up a specific time scale - 
seeing construction start in 2015 and end, at the latest, in 2017.

He told the Evening Standard: 'If people want the bridge to happen, then it has to happen now.

'Otherwise, it will just be one of those nice things that didn’t happen.'

He adds that the flower meadow Danny Boyle created for the opening ceremony last year has further inspired the project.

He told the Standard: 'What I thought was that of course the venues were impressive, and the Games amazing, but what I won’t forget is the wild planting.

'We are used to quite a harsh experience in the architectural landscape around us. Often environments don’t have a human scale, but plants give you that.

'There is something unpretentious about them — this project will have slugs and worms and autumn smells, rather than grand, Versailles-like power-planting.'
