Southampton will press ahead with a move for Cardiff defender Steven Caulker this week in a bid to head off the challenge from QPR and Crystal palace for his signature.

As reported by Sportsmail, the former Tottenham man features on manager Ronald Koeman’s summer shopping list.

And with Liverpool edging closer to a move for Dejan Lovren, the Saints are stepping up their pursuit of Caulker.

But QPR appear to be leading the chase for Caulker who is undergoing a medical with the west London club.

In demand: Steven Caulker is set to leave Cardiff after their relegation last season 

Cardiff chiefs have been made aware of Southampton’s interest in Caulker, who is understood to have an £8million release clause.

A host of clubs are interested in Caulker, including Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers, while Arsenal are monitoring his situation as they weigh up their options ahead of Thomas Vermaelen’s potential exit to Manchester United.

Palace and QPR have both tabled offers for Caulker this summer, but Southampton’s interest adds further intrigue to the defender’s future.

Is that the way to Anfield? Dejan Lovren's (centre) move to Liverpool will create a vacancy at Southampton
