James Francis outside Warwickshire Magistrates court today. He is alleged to have stolen luxury goods from ex-Aston Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie's home

The son of football legend
Trevor Francis has appeared in court charged with burglary after he allegedly
stole a pair of Jimmy Choo shoes and expensive jewellery from former England star and Aston
Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie's £1.7million home.

Appearing at
Warwickshire Magistrates Court, Leamington Spa, today, 24-year-old
James John Francis was committed to appear for trial at Warwick Crown Court on
February 29.

Francis, who wore a smart grey suit with
an expensive-looking watch, spoke only to confirm his name, age and address
during the short hearing.

The youngest son of Birmingham City legend
Trevor, who became Britain's first £1million player in 1979, is alleged to
have stolen a string of luxury goods from a cottage at Hendrie's six-bedroom
country house in leafy Rowington, Warwickshire, in July last year.

Among
the high-value goods stolen, it is alleged Mr Francis jnr, who is a
semi-professional footballer himself, stole golf clubs, a Vertu smartphone,
designer clothes and one diamond earring.

At the height of his sporting
fame, Hendrie, who now plays for non-league Kidderminster Harriers, was well
known for his love of designer gear, and the ex-England international was often
barracked by rival fans for sporting a sparkling diamond earring.

The list of other goods allegedly stolen
is: Roberto Cavalli boots, designer sunglasses, Gucci boots, a Versace watch,
Dolce and Gabbana boots, a jewellery box containing costume jewellery, and six
souvenir football shirts.

Mr Francis Jr was arrested by West
Midlands Police last year and later charged with one count of burglary (other
than from a dwelling) contrary to the Theft Act 1968, and first appeared at
Leamington Magistrates Court on November 16.

It is understood that the charge centres
around allegations that Mr Francis Jr committed burglary at a cottage in the
sprawling grounds of Hendrie's mansion, Finwood Lawn, between July 8 and the
end of July last year.

It is alleged that the 24-year-old, who
himself has played for a variety of Midland clubs, broke into a cottage, one of
two on the site, which was apparently being used as a storeroom at the time.

Hendrie was not believed to have been
living at Finwood Lawn at the time of the alleged burglary last July and his
main home is in Solihull.

James Francis is regarded as a talented
local footballer but has never shown the promise that turned his father into a
legendary household name after his £1million transfer from Nottingham
Forest to Birmingham City.

Family man Trevor Francis won 53 caps for
England and the striker famously scored the only goal in the 1-0 European Cup
final win over Malmo for Brian Clough's team.

He later played for Glasgow Rangers,
Manchester City and Italian giant Sampdoria - before managing Sheffield
Wednesday, Crystal Palace and his beloved Birmingham City.

Former Villa hero Hendrie paid £1.6million in 2006 for his Warwickshire pad, which is currently up for sale for
£1.7million.

He played 251 times for Aston Villa between 1995 and 2007,
scoring 27 goals and taking home £24,000 at the height of his playing powers.

He helped Villa to two League Cup trophies and picked up a single England cap in 1998.

But his success on the pitch was marred by
controversy off it, with a conviction for drink-driving and allegations of
womanising by his estranged wife.
