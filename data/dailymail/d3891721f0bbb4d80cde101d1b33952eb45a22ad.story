Pepe Mel’s grip on his job at West Bromwich Albion is loosening amid chaos and growing tension behind the scenes at the Hawthorns.

Mel, 50, has failed to win in six matches, taking four points from as many home games, but owner Jeremy Peace is understood to be unhappy with the situation and may even follow Fulham’s lead and make a second managerial switch if matters do not improve quickly.

West Brom are just one point above the relegation zone following an horrific run since November of just one victory in 15 matches.

Flashpoint: Mel calms down Fulham defender John Heitinga and West Brom's Youssuf Mulumbu after Saturday's 1-1, which did neither team any favours in their Premier League survival bid

Little impact: Mel was announced as West Brom boss on January 16 but has yet to lead the team to a victory

Concerned: West Brom's Jonas Olsson, right, and Gareth McAuley, left, fear their lack of pace will be exposed by the tactics of Mel

They returned early from a break in 
Jerez last week and there has already been one clear-the-air meeting 
between Mel, the coaching staff and the players, with former caretaker 
Keith Downing acting as the go-between.

The
 first team are unhappy at Mel’s insistence on playing a pressing game, 
high up the field.

Centre-halves Gareth McAuley and Jonas Olsson are not
 the quickest and they fear they will be exposed by these tactics.

The
 players favour a return to Roy Hodgson’s methods which led to their 
highest Premier League finish, of eighth, two seasons ago.

Their view 
has been communicated to Mel and a new blueprint is reportedly being 
discussed this week.

However, 
there is also disquiet about David McDonough’s role as director of 
technical performance.

The Spanish-speaker was a prime mover in the 
appointment of Mel, a team-mate of Benitez in the Real Madrid youth 
team.

Disquiet: Dave McDonough, who used to work for Liverpool, is having his role as West Brom's director of technical performance questioned

Time for a fresh approach: West Brom sacked Steve Clarke in December

McDonough was understood
 to have been among those present when Steve Clarke was sacked in 
December, a fact that did not sit comfortably with several members of 
the backroom team.

West Brom’s
 sporting and technical director Richard Garlick is also new to his role
 but McDonough appears to have usurped him too, carving out a niche for 
himself within the club that has not been well received.

Crucially, 
however, the former Liverpool employee does appear to have the backing 
of the club’s owner, Peace.

With
 all of these issues swirling around the training ground, West Brom have
 also taken the decision to restructure their scouting department.

against Newcastle on January 1, 2014 - the last time the Baggies tasted victory

However,
 the manner of the changes left a nasty taste in the mouths of staff 
with former midfielder Bobby Hope, the chief scout, and head of 
European recruitment Tony Spearing both in the line of fire, along with 
chief scout Stuart White.

West
 Brom insisted on Tuesday that Mel’s position was under no immediate 
threat. They added that McDonough had reverted to his original role as 
head of analysis and was undertaking no duties on the training field 
with regard to the first team.

Next up: Manchester United and Wayne Rooney will face West Brom at The Hawthorns on March 8

The
 club also confirmed that several positions were being re-designated 
among their recruitment staff but insisted that the end of Hope’s 
employment was amicable. The Scot has given 26 years’ service to West 
Brom as a player and, latterly, as a scout.

West
 Brom have long been championed as a club that punches above their 
weight but the loss of former technical and sporting director Dan 
Ashworth to the FA, plus a succession of poor decisions in the transfer 
market, have contributed to the current position.

With
 Manchester United their next opponents at the Hawthorns on March 8, it 
may well be that Mel’s problems worsen, inflaming an already combustible
 situation, before they get better.

Brought in as head of analysis by Jeremy Peace to improve data collection on transfer targets.

However, the loss of Dan Ashworth to the FA left a vacuum.

With Richard Garlick new to the technical director role, McDonough has stepped into the void.
