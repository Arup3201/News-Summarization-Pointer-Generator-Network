Claims: Scotland Yard has reportedly interviewed the wife of a soldier that said Princess Diana was assassinated by the SAS

Prince Charles and Mohamed Al Fayed are being contacted by police as they assess claims that the SAS murdered Princess Diana.

Scotland Yard said they are also getting in touch with Lord Justice Scott Baker, the judge who presided over the inquest into her death.

Diana, 36, Mr Al Fayed's son Dodi, 42, and chauffeur Henri Paul, 41, all died in a crash in Paris in August 1997.

Police are currently carrying out a 'scoping exercise' as they look into claims that the trio were murdered by a member of the British Military.

They have not launched a full investigation.

Royal 
bodyguards and MPs have brushed off accusations that the Princess of 
Wales' death 16 years ago was carried out by British special 
forces who then 'covered it up'.

The sensational allegation surfaced in the second court martial of Sergeant 
Danny Nightingale, the SAS sniper convicted of illegally stashing a 
pistol and 338 bullets in his bedroom.

The claim was contained in a letter from the parents-in-law of Soldier N, Sgt Nightingale's former housemate, which was sent to the SAS's commanding officer in September 2011.

Scotland Yard confirmed in a brief statement this morning that they will be contacting members of the Royal family to inform them about the new developments.

'We are in the process of notifying Princess Diana's family, the family of Dodi Al Fayed and Lord Justice Scott Baker,' a spokesman said.

Princess Diana and with Dodi Fayed (pictured together on the night they died) were killed alongside Henri Paul when the car crashed in a Paris tunnel 

Scotland Yard routinely contact relevant parties to keep them informed about what is going on when there are new developments in a historic case.

The
 eight-page correspondence claims Soldier N boasted it was the SAS that 
had ‘arranged Princess Diana’s death’ and that it had been ‘covered up’.

The families of Henri Paul and Dodi al Fayed (pictured with Princess Diana) have always believed there was a murder plot

Sergeant 
Nightingale, 38, was found guilty last month of illegally possessing a 
pistol and ammunition at a Hereford house he shared with Soldier N.

Soldier
 N, who is serving a custodial sentence for possessing firearms at the 
same address, was originally reported to the police by his wife, from 
whom he is now separated.

The letter was sent to Soldier N’s 
commanding officer in September 2011 and passed to the Service 
Prosecuting Authority before the start of the Nightingale trial.

All references to the SAS were removed by the SPA.

The
 paragraph referring to the death of Diana says: ‘He also told her (his 
wife) that it was the XXX who arranged Princess Diana’s death and that 
has been covered up.’

The
 letter says Soldier N told his wife there is a ‘box which members of 
his unit use for private jobs’.

‘They put in the box the name, address 
and details of what they want done and then one of them who wants to 
earn extra money does that job.’

When
 Soldier N was challenged by his mother-in-law, he is accused of saying:
 ‘Let me stop you right there – I kill women and I kill children.’

As well as hiding weapons in his 
house, in a 'reign of terror' on his family Soldier N allegedly attacked
his son after mistaking him for the Taliban.

The jury in the 2008 inquest concluded its verdict as 'unlawful killing, grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the Mercedes', the Met said

His
 children were also allegedly driven around in the boot of his Land 
Rover and he had hung his son 30ft above the ground in a tree.

An inquest in 2008 found that Princess 
Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the ‘gross 
negligence’ of driver Henri Paul, a security manager at the Paris Ritz Hotel, who 
had been drinking.

Henri Paul's mother Gisele 
said she believed her son was murdered together with Diana and Mr Al 
Fayed when the Mercedes he was driving crashed in an underpass.

Mrs Paul, 83, said: ‘We believe there was a plot to kill the Princess that terrible night in August 1997.

‘We know in our hearts that our son was murdered and we still live with the hope that one day the truth will be known.’

The
 new information was also welcomed by Dodi’s father, former Harrods 
owner Mohamed Al Fayed, who also insists the couple were murdered. He 
said he trusted the Metropolitan Police would investigate the new claims
 ‘with vigour’.

A Royal spokesman said there would be no comment from the Duke of Cambridge, Prince Harry or Clarence House.
