A man who spoke out over a late-night brawl involving Sarah Palin's family has been fired for telling the media about it.

Eric Thompson, 56, was at a party in Anchorage, Alaska, when members of the Palin's family - including Sarah Palin's daughter Bristol - allegedly lashed out at other guests before driving off in a stretch Hummer shouting 'Don't you know who we are?'

Thompson, who was not involved in the brawl, gave a statement to police in Anchorage after the event, and later gave a detailed account of the fracas in a television interview - for which he paid a heavy price.

As soon as the interview had aired on ABC's Good Morning America, Thompson received a call from his employers at the McKenna Brothers Paving Company, who fired him immediately.

He has now posted a video to YouTube explaining his plight and has started an online giving page for financial help while he looks for a job, which has amassed more than $9,000.

In the clip he is seen walking the streets of Anchorage with a carboard sign, having told the camera: 'I was fired for telling the truth about the Palin brawl.' 

He has since expanded on his account of the brawl, saying that he saw Bristol Palin, 23, punch the host of the party six times in the face in response to being asked to leave - before the party descended into an incomprehensible 'dogpile'. 

Thompson told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'I wasn’t in the front yard, an employee of McKenna Bros. Paving, punching somebody in the face. That was the Palins. They did this, not me.

'I feel that maybe they [McKenna Brothers] got squeezed. Maybe Palins do wield a little more, you know, power. ... Anybody that’s ever come against them, they seem to just, you know, find a way to destroy them.' 

Thompson also expanded on his account of the alleged fist-fight, which he says happened September 6.

He told the Dispatch News that the Palins turned up at the home of Korey Klingenmeyer, an office manager at McKenna Brothers, in a stretch Hummer around 8.30pm, when there were about 70 people at the party.

The party continued as expected until around 11pm, Thompson said, when he heard about a fight between Track Palin, a 23-year-old Army reservist, and an unnamed Anchorage local.

Thompson then said he saw Klingenmeyer attempt to throw out Bristol and Willow Palin, Sarah's daughters, after hearing about the incident.

He then claims Bristol's reaction to the 'polite' request was to smack Klingenmeyer in the face six times - 'straight, hard punches to the face.'

When Klingenmeyer pushed her away from him, she reportedly fell over, leading to Todd Palin, Sarah's husband, stepping in.

Thompson then said the confrontation descended into a 'dogpile' fight, and when it broke away Track Palin made offensive gestures and swore at the crowd as the Palin clan drove away. 

There have been mixed reports about the incident, with sources close to Palin reportedly disputing details of the fight, and saying the 'Don't you know who we are?' comment was misheard.

Anchorage Police confirmed that the fight - involving around 20 people - took place, and said alcohol was probably a facotr.

A spokesman said: 'Anchorage police responded to a report of a verbal and physical altercation taking place between multiple subjects outside of a residence.

'A preliminary investigation by police revealed that a party had been taking place at a nearby residence and a fight had broken out between multiple subjects outside of the residence... Some of the Palin family members were in attendance at the party.'

Although none of the parties wanted to press charges at the time of the incident, police confirmed that the case is still an active investigation and is being reviewed by APD and the Municipal Prosecutors Office.

MailOnline has contacted Sarah Palin and McKenna Brothers Paving for comment.
