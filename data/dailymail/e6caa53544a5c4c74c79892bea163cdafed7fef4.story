Tragic: Fiona Geraghty, 14, who was bulimic, hanged herself after being taunted about her weight

The fashion industry’s obsession with ‘wafer-thin’ models should be held ‘directly responsible’ for the death of a public schoolgirl, a  coroner said yesterday.

Fiona Geraghty, 14, who was bulimic, hanged herself after being taunted about her weight.

In a scathing attack, coroner Michael Rose blamed magazine images for  turning a ‘bright and bubbly girl’, who loved singing and horse-riding, into a  teenager gripped by ‘mental turmoil’.

He said Fiona had died because of the ‘perception, prompted by the fashion industry’, that she should be thinner.

Calling it ‘one of the most tragic cases to come before me in 40 years’, he added: ‘The one class of person who is not here, whom I hold directly responsible for what happened, is the fashion industry.

‘The problem of eating disorders in young girls didn’t exist before the 1970s. It was from that point on that the fashion industry, the magazines that supported it and the models, promoted the thin figure.

Outside court: Dr Elspeth Geraghty and Dr John Geraghty pictured after the inquest today where they said their lives had been 'blown apart' by when their daughter Fiona was found dead in July last year

‘I ask for magazines in the fashion 
industry to stop publishing photographs of wafer-thin girls.  For their 
vanity, families like this suffer.

‘It is an increasing problem  and, until they control themselves, tragedies like this will continue.’

The
inquest heard that Fiona, a pupil at £18,000-a-year King’s College in 
Taunton, Somerset, was a ‘delightful’ and gifted girl from a ‘close and 
loving family’.

But the ‘sunny child’, who  loved horses and the outdoors, struggled to settle at her school.

In
February last year, King’s  College contacted Fiona’s parents to tell 
them that their daughter had been bingeing on chocolate and crisps 
before vomiting.

Loved: Fiona was described by an aunt as a 'beautiful, sunny child who had everything going for her'

The 
teenager later told her doctor she had started making herself  sick 
following taunts from other schoolgirls about her weight.

She was taken to see Ross Gillanders, a community psychiatric nurse with Somerset NHS Trust.

Help: Fiona saw a community psychiatric nurse on four occasions before she was discharged just two weeks before she committed suicide, the Taunton hearing was told

However, after just four sessions, he sent her home on May 5 last year after judging her risk of suicide to be one out of ten.

Two months later, on July 14, Fiona hanged herself at her home in Nailsbourne near Taunton.

After
her death it was revealed she had written an essay in which she 
referred to her ‘self-loathing’ and bulimia, which the school had failed
to pass on to her family.

Richard
Biggs, headmaster of King’s College, told the inquest that eating 
disorders had become an ‘increasing cause for concern’ at the school. He
said one sixth form girl had become so ill she was unable to return, 
while another in the fifth form lost so much weight  that she had to be 
treated at the school’s medical centre.

Returning
a verdict of misadventure, Mr Rose said he could not be ‘certain’ Fiona
had wanted to end her own life and it may have been ‘a cry for help’ 
that went wrong.

After 
the verdict, Fiona’s mother, Dr Elspeth Geraghty, a GP, and father John,
a hospital consultant, said their ‘lives had been blown apart’ by the 
teenager’s death.

‘It is something no parent should go through,’ they added. ‘Eating disorders are common and one in 25 sufferers die as a result.

‘We
feel the diagnosis and treatment by the Child and Adolescent Mental 
Health Services was inadequate. Had she received their improved services
Fiona would still be here with us.’

Alison
Chisholm, of the Somerset Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, 
said: ‘The majority referred with eating disorders were from private 
schools.

‘We are not 
sure what the reasons are, but there has been a significant increase in 
the rates and complexity of the disorders. Children are more ill when 
they come to us.’
