Clive Goodman, the former royal editor of The News of the World leaves the Old Bailey after giving evidence

Police did not publicly reveal the extent of hacking at the News of the World out of 'discretion' for victims - including members of the royal family, jurors heard today.

Former royal editor for the paper, Clive Goodman, insisted that he had always been 'open and honest' even when confronted with evidence yesterday that he repeatedly hacked Kate Middleton, Prince William and Prince Harry.

He claimed that he was simply a 'spear carrier' rather than the 'five act opera' of hacking, if compared to a colleague - who cannot be named.

The Old Bailey heard, at the time he was caught, that 'there was not a single significant story broken at the NotW in the last couple of years' that the colleague had not got from tampering with phones.

Goodman, 56, of Addlestone, Surrey, was dismissed in 2007 after he pleaded guilty and was jailed for hacking royal aides with private detective Glenn Mulcaire.

He gave evidence under renewed questioning by former 
NotW editor Andy Coulson’s lawyer.

Goodman denied staying quiet about the 
extent of his phone hacking when he appealed against his sacking.

Timothy Langdale QC said: 'The one thing you were not going to tell them was the extent of your activities.'

Goodman replied: 'As I said yesterday I have been completely open and honest about the extent of phone hacking.

'The reason these things did not come into the public domain before was the police and CPS in 2006/07 decided they were not going to publish things to protect the discretion of the victims.

'The only reason they came up now is they were not out there in the public domain at the time.'

He went on: 'Whatever I have been accused of I have admitted to and paid an extremely high price for it.'

He claimed that when he appealed against his dismissal in 2007 he wanted others at the NotW to 'admit their responsibility'.

Goodman is on trial with Coulson for conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office in relation to paying police for information.

He does not face any further hacking charges.

Coulson along with ex NotW editor Rebekah Brooks and former managing editor Stuart Kuttner are accused of conspiring to hack phones. All seven defendants deny the charges against them.

Goodman hacked Kate Middleton’s phone and listened to a message from Prince William telling her about being ambushed and shot with blanks on a night exercise at Aldershot, the court heard.

Mr Langdale pointed out the voicemail from the prince telling his then girlfriend about the incident in January 2006.

The lawyer said: 'Who hacked Kate Middleton’s phone to get that message?'

Goodman replied: 'It may have been me, it may have been Glenn Mulcaire. It may have been both.'

Mr Langdale said Goodman had indicated previously that another message from Prince William to royal aide Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton was the source of the story.

He then presented the witness with phone records showing the future Duchess of Cambridge’s voicemails were accessed several times between January 25 and January 27 2006.

One hacking at midnight on the 27th lasted seven minutes and 12 seconds.

Goodman responded: 'I accept I hacked her phone but I think Mr Mulcaire also hacked her phone.

'It was going on continually throughout. It is quite obvious here. I have never denied it.'

Timothy Langdale QC, defending Coulson, accused Goodman of not revealing the full extent of his own hacking while trying to implicate others in the scandal.

The court heard yesterday that Goodman had hacked the phones of Prince William and Kate Middleton nearly 200 times in total, and hacked into Prince Harry’s voicemails nine times.

Mr Langdale said: ‘The one thing you are not going to do is tell them was the extent of your activities.’

Goodman replied: ‘The extent of my activities - I had been completely open and honest about the extent of phone hacking.

‘The reasons things didn’t come out into the public domain before was because the police and CPS in 2006 and 2007 decided that weren’t going to publicise the cases for reasons of their own - to protect the discretion of the victims.

‘The only reason this came out now is because you have chosen to bring them into the public domain.’

He said he did not outline the full extent of his own hacking ‘because it wasn’t the terms of the appeal’.

Goodman added: ‘This was a very hostile confrontation between two senior executives of News International and me on my own.

‘It did get a bit tense.’

Allegations: Kate Middleton and Prince William on the day of their graduation at St Andrew's University in June 2005. The Duchess was said in court to have been first hacked in December that year by Goodman

Mr Langdale challenged him: ‘You 
didn’t say a single word to Mr Cloke and Mr Myler about the extent of 
your phone hacking activities.’

Goodman
 replied: ‘My phone hacking activities were known, I had been charged 
with what the police felt was relevant, and I had been convicted.

‘What this was about was getting others in the paper to admit their responsibilities.’

Goodman
 denied he had contradicted a draft statement from 2006 that claimed a 
colleague knew about the £500-a-week deal with private detective Glenn 
Mulcaire to hack Royal aide’s phones.

He said in his statement that the colleague had ‘full knowledge and approval’ of the project when it began in October 2005.

Mr
 Langdale pointed out yesterday Goodman had said the fact he was working
 with Mulcaire had been kept from the other journalist for fear of 
upsetting him.

‘We would discuss the stories produced often, but it is not the case that we discussed stories from Glenn Mulcaire or (his company) Nine Consultancy.’

Mr Langdale told him: ‘You change your story as and when it suits you.’

Goodman replied: ‘That’s not true, I have had a very straight forward story since day one of this, and a very clear story.’

Goodman returned to the court yesterday for the first time in nine weeks to continue his evidence to the phone hacking trial.

He had been diagnosed with a new heart condition and battled a bout of pneumonia before being declared fit to resume his evidence.

others to finish giving his evidence after he fell ill on March 21. All 
seven defendants deny the charges

Mr Justice Saunders told the jury this morning that Goodman is feeling side effects from his treatment, and the court will take regular breaks to help him.

‘In your absence, Mr Goodman told me he is having some difficulties in giving evidence’, he said.

‘As you are aware, the problem he had originally required him to stop giving evidence was a fast rapid heartbeat.’

He said Goodman has been put on drugs to deal with the heart problem, and underwent an angiogram to ensure he was well enough to give evidence.

‘One of the side effects of having the angiogram is yesterday he felt his heart going faster again’, he said.

‘He knows as you and I do we need to get through this but we can’t endanger his life by doing so.’
