Lego has unveiled a radical augmented reality app that brings real-life toys built out of the iconic bricks to life when viewed through a tablet or phone.

Each $35 Lego Fusion box, which go on sale in August, will contain some 200 bricks and a special baseplate to build on.

When children point their tablet camera at the finished toy, it springs to life and lets them play games.

Lego Fusion line combines traditional LEGO bricks with app gaesm. Creations on a special base plate can be photographed with Apple or Android phones or tablets and imported into free, downloadable games.

Each Lego fusion box consists of a distinct set of bricks, a free downloadable app and the new Fusion capture plate, a small brick building plate with a printed design that enables a smart phone or tablet's camera to identify the size and colors of the LEGO bricks built onto it.

In response to game prompts, children build vertically in 2-D on the capture plate, enabling the app to 'see,' import and transform the creation into 3-D in the digital world.

Creations on the plate can be photographed with Apple or Android phones or tablets and imported into free, downloadable games.

There are several Lego-themed games already, but this is the first time it's blending real and virtual this way.

Many toy companies are going down that route, trying to capture some of the attention - and money - that's being diverted from physical products to iPhone and Android games.

In 'Lego Fusion Town Master,' kids build house facades on the plates and import them into a game that simulates a small town, inhabited by Lego figures.

In 'Battle Towers,' they build sections of a medieval-style tower and defend it against flying monsters. In 'Create & Race,' they build cars and race them on a virtual track.

Different designs yield cars that differ in speed, durability and handling.

In September, Lego is following up with 'Resort Designer,' in the style of its girl-oriented 'Friends' line.

The games are designed to force the kids to return to the physical blocks and rebuild their structures, said Ditte Bruun Pedersen, senior design manager at Lego's Future Lab.

The kits its will cost $30 each, and contain around 200 bricks along with the special base

But the lab's research also shows that kids want to bring their physical creations to life, she said.

'Kids want to be this mini-figure and they want to be in this world they create,' Pedersen said.

'Children have always imagined their LEGO creations as immersive worlds which come to life for hours of role-play and adventure,' said Pedersen.

The special base allows the app to work out where each brick is, and trigger the virtual game on screen

'Recently, smart phones and tablets have become a popular platform for empowering game mechanisms that kids love. Fusion brings these two favorite play patterns together in an experience where real-life builds come to life in a virtual game, inspiring creativity, strategy, and the pride of creation.'

The Fusion boxes are launching in the U.S. only and will be exclusive to Toys R Us and Lego's own stores, Lego said.

The firm also designed the game to make players switch between on screen action and the virtual game.

'In our research, we heard repeatedly from parents that they are constantly battling 'zombie gaze,' the experience when their children are immersed in their device screens for large blocks of time, said Pedersen.

'We developed Lego Fusion with this challenge in mind, creating a play experience that keeps children entertained with the kind of app gameplay they love while giving real reasons to return to the brick pile to creatively build.'
