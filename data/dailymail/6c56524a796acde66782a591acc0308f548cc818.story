A headteacher who left a vulnerable child crying on the floor outside of her office for so long that she wet herself has been struck off.

Susan Stuart, 68, had been in charge at Greenfields Community Primary School in Kettering, Northamptonshire since 2004.

However, a panel at the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard how the child was twice taken to see Stuart in 2008, with one teacher claiming she was left there for four hours.

Stuart, who insisted that the child was there for 60 minutes, would open the door and say 'stop making that noise' when she heard the child sobbing, the hearing was told.

Meanwhile another teacher said that the child informed them that on one occasion the child was in such a state, she wet herself.

The head teacher said the child was throwing a tantrum after refusing to attend music assembly, and that she 'needed to learn that having a temper tantrum would not get her what she wanted.'

Panel chair Martin Greendale said: 'The panel was concerned that the child was not treated with dignity and due regard for the child's welfare.

'The panel were particularly concerned that Mrs Stuart had not demonstrated insight into how she could have acted differently, save for stating that with regard to the child it would have been better for her to have been placed in an empty classroom with a Learning Support Assistant.'

Stuart, who has been retired for four years, was also found to have made a girl cry when she could not eat a 'revolting' lunch that had been provided because of her dietary requirements.

As the child was being walked to collect a homemade lunch from her mother as a replacement, Stuart intervened saying: 'You will eat it. Be grateful for what you have got.'

A hearing at the National College for Teaching and Leadership heard that on one occasion the child was in such as state that she wet herself 

Other infringements included placing a colleague under undue pressure, and not providing adequate support for her to fill her role, and asking another teacher to call another member of staff who was on sick leave.

Mr Greendale added: 'In light of the panel's findings against Mrs Stuart, which involved a failure to treat a child with dignity and with regard to her welfare, there is a strong public interest consideration in the protection of pupils.

'Although Mrs Stuart is retired, she could return to teaching at any time, if a prohibition order was not imposed.'

Stuart was found to have behaved inappropriately with regard to more than one child, and more than one colleague.

She was also found to have made a number of errors in school policy including not updating the prospectus since 2005.

As a result she was banned from teaching, and cannot apply for the order to be set aside until 27 October 2016.

Speaking after the hearing Stuart now says she intends to appeal the decision.

She said: ‘I strenuously deny it. It is simply not true. I will most definitely appeal this.

‘I am totally innocent of the charge relating to the child who was outside my office. It just isn’t true.

‘There was an investigation by the governors and I was exonerated.’
