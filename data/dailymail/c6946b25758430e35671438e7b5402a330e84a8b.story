Speaking out: Ed Miliband has professed he does not believe in God - but says he does still have 'faith'

Ed Miliband has professed that he does not believe in God - but says he does still have ‘faith’.

The Labour leader, speaking about his religious beliefs in detail for the first time, said he would be the ‘first Jewish prime minister’ if he wins the next election.

But he said his faith, which is ‘part of who I am’, is compatible with being an atheist, claiming that like many religious believers, he hopes to ‘change the world’.

David Cameron, who spoke about his own faith this week, is the only one of the three party leaders to say he believes in God, as Nick Clegg is also an atheist.

But during his tour of Israel and the West Bank, Mr Miliband distanced himself from the last Labour government which, in the words of spin doctor Alistair Campbell, did not ‘do God’.

Britain, he said in an interview, is a ‘Christian country’ despite declining observance, and he strongly believes religion ‘nourishes people’.

He said: ‘I have a particular faith. I describe myself as a Jewish atheist. I’m Jewish by birth origin and it’s a part of who I am.

‘I don’t believe in God, but I think faith is a really, really important thing to a lot of people. It provides nourishment for lots of people.

‘In terms of faith for me, it’s a faith about how you change the world. And that is actually true for a lot of religious people as well.’ 

Faith, he said, has an ‘important place in society’ and he added that many faith schools do an ‘incredible job.’

Mr Miliband’s Jewish parents were not practising, but he has spoken about the impact their experience fleeing Nazi persecution had on his decision to go into politics.

‘It’s obviously relevant to me, and I
 hope to members of the community aswell, that I would be the first 
Jewish prime minister if we win the election’, he said yesterday.

The
 Victorian Conservative Benjamin Disraeli, who coined the term ‘One 
Nation’ that is now a Labour mantra, is often remembered as the first, 
as he was born to Italian Jewish parents.

But
 he was baptised as an Anglican aged 12 when his father left the 
religion - which would later enable him to run for parliament in 1837, 
from which Jews were excluded until 1858.

The prime minister, who in the past 
said he was not a regular churchgoer, told church leaders at an Easter 
reception in Number 10 this week how he finds ‘moments of greatest 
peace’ at Thursday morning services. He even claimed Jesus was 
responsible for his ‘Big Society’ policy.

Mr Miliband added that Britain was ‘really lucky’ to have the Church of England as the established church.

‘It
 is a great institution in terms of what it does in our society, not 
just spiritual faith and nourishment that it gives to lots of people, 
but also the good work it does in communities’, he said.

Mr Miliband added that faith schools do an 'incredible' job and are important for British society

Long lost relative: The Labour leader also met a long lost 'aunt' he had not seen in 37 years. Above, Mr Miliband, his wife and his 84-year-old aunt, Sarah Ben Zvi, at her home on Nachshonim Kibbutz near Tel Aviv in Israel

The 2011 census found around 
14million people in Britain, have no religion, although it is not clear 
how many people are atheists.

He
 follows the tradition of Labour former leaders Neil Kinnock and Michael
 Foot, who declared they did not believe in God. Although Tony Blair, 
despite his adviser’s rhetoric, was a practising Roman Catholic.

Nick Clegg is also an atheist but brings up his sons in his wife Miriam’s Catholic faith.
