A young mother returned home with her baby boy yesterday just 13 days after a nightmare labour which put her into a coma.

Fiona Moore had two heart attacks and lost 14 pints of blood while giving birth to her second child.

During the delivery, she fell into a coma which lasted two days, while 30 doctors and midwives battled to save both her life and that of her baby.

Home sweet home: Fiona Moore nearly died while giving birth to baby Wesley. She suffered two heart attacks and lost 14 pints of blood

The 25-year-old suffered an amniotic embolism - which affects just 1 in 10,000 births - when fluid from her womb leaked into her body.

The embolism triggered two heart attacks in quick succession and caused massive haemorraghing of her womb.

Surgeons delivered Miss Moore's son, Wesley Hitchman, by emergency caesarean while doctors battled to restart her heart when it stopped beating.

Now, less than two weeks after her ordeal, the young mother is back home in Wood End, Coventry, with her partner Wayne Hitchman, 28.

Miss Moore said: 'One doctor sat at the end of my hospital bed and told me I really gave everyone a fright.

'As she was telling me about what happened she started to cry and I began crying too.

'I can't thank the doctors and midwives enough. They didn't just save my life, they saved my baby too.'

All together again: Fiona with her partner Wayne Hitchman, and sons Travis and Wesley

Miss Moore, who also has a two-and-a-half-year-old son Travis, went into University Hospital Coventry on December 21 to be induced.

Initially everything went as planned but at 5am the next day her heart stopped.

Her partner Wayne said: 'Fiona was struggling to breath so we helped her sit up, but her whole face started turning blue.

'They called the emergency team who began CPR. I heard one of the midwives say "she's not breathing". I started to break down.

Miracle baby: Wesley's birth is even more astonishing because Miss Moore was initially told by doctors she would not be able to have children

'There must have been 30 people in that 
room working to save her.'

Miss Moore was rushed into surgery and within
20 minutes doctors delivered her healthy baby son Wesley.

He was taken to the special care unit as a precaution while surgeons battled to stop her massive internal bleeding.

She lost 14 pints of blood and lay in a coma for two days before waking up on Christmas Eve.

Wesley's birth is even more astonishing after Miss Moore was initially told by doctors she would not be able to have children.

But she defied the odds when she got pregnant with her first son Travis in 2008.

However she also suffered complications during his birth, after his shoulder got stuck and his umbilical cord became wrapped around his neck.

Miss Moore said: 'The doctors can't believe how well we're both doing. I don't remember anything, I lost a week of my life.Â 

'It was my family, the doctors and the midwives who really went through everything - it must have felt like months to them.

'When something goes wrong you fear the worst. But this shows miracles really do happen at Christmas.'

Consultant obstetrician Professor Siobhan Quenby, who treated Miss Moore, said: 'It was a fantastic team effort - I don't think there were many people in the hospital that night who weren't involved.

'For two days we weren't sure she was going to make it.

'It was quite emotional. Nobody wanted this beautiful baby to be left without a mother.'
