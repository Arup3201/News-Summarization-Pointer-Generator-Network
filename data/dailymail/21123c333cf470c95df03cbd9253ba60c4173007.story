After a busy year  - which included designing her own beauty line and giving birth to her second son Klay Anthony  - Coleen Rooney is now launching her latest collection for Littlewoods.com. 

This time, she's turned her hand to jewellery, creating a range of attention-grabbing pieces for the party season.

Items include chunky two-tone watches, stacking rings and bangles studded with colourful gems.

Coleen also added statement necklaces to the range - just the thing to revive that old LBD for the office party. Prices start at £24 and go up to £69.

She'll be going head to head with the Kardashians, who have just released a jewellery collection for Argos.

Speaking about her latest venture Coleen commented, ‘I always follow the rules of Coco Chanel when it comes to jewellery.'

'When accessorising, always take off the last thing you put on.’

Two-tone: This classic sports bracelet watch £69, is a smart addition to the collection

This faux gold and crystal set tortoise shell watch £94, is great for everyday use
