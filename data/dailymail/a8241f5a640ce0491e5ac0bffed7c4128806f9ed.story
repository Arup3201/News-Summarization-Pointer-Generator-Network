The Manhattan Dunkin' Donuts store that made headlines this week when a YouTube user uploaded videos showing a rat infestation has been shut down by the New York City Health Department.

In one video, a rat crawls around baked goods - touching croissants and bagels packed in open tubs for the morning rush. The other video shows a rat crawling up one of the store's curtains.

While the location manager initially denied the store had a vermin problem when contacted by Gothamist on Wednesday, today a man who answered the phone said: 'We have some issues'.

Rat home: The vermin spotting allegedly took place at this Dunkin' Donuts location in New York's Garment District

The Health Department issued their 
own statement following the store's closing, saying they take all 
reports of unsanitary conditions seriously.

'Dunkin’
 Donuts was closed by the Health Department yesterday because of a 
public health hazard that could not be corrected at the time of the 
inspection. In this case, the restaurant had a severe pest infestation 
that will require professional pest control services,' the statement 
read.

Pictures sent into Gothamist show workers at the store dismantling the front counter and cleaning.

The store was also cited for 'inadequate hand washing facilities and food not being protected from contamination'.

The infestation drew the attention of the Health Department and many donut-loving New Yorkers when YouTube user 'Pjayone' posted the videos on April 1.

'New York runs on Dunkin', just ask this rat,' a man is recorded saying in the background in the second video.

In an email to Gothamist, the rat whistle-blower explains that this is a normal occurrence  at the location.

'At two-thirty [in the morning] every [day] the workers load the shelves with the morning's wares. Shortly thereafter like clockwork the rats come out and party.'

'My phone ran out of power, or I would've filmed the outright nine deep rat assault which followed the action above,' he added.

'The items in the video that are being besieged upon by the rats were to be sold for that mornings breakfast rush.'

The location captured in the video previously had an 'A' rating from the health department, despite getting a citation for vermin-related issues in November 2013.

The citation called the facility 'not vermin proof. Harboarge or conditions conductive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowed vermin to exist.'

Dunkin' Donuts' corporate offices issued their own statement, saying 'food safety is a top priority'.

'We have stringent food safety and quality standards, and we take great pride in the food and beverages we serve to our guests every day.

'We take this matter very seriously. Immediately upon learning of the situation at the Dunkin' Donuts restaurant at 265 West 37th Street, a certified Operations Manager inspected the restaurant to ensure that all appropriate Dunkin’ Donuts food safety standards are being followed.'

On the coffee and donut run: A Gothamist reporter stood outside the location on Wednesday, showing the video to regulars

Regulars: The lady on the left was surprisingly unbothered by the rat spotting, while her friend on the right was considerably unsettled

'Ew. That's disgusting' was all this woman had to say about the rat video

On Wednesday, Gothamist reporters showed the video to several regulars outside the location, and their reactions were surprisingly mixed.

One woman with a strong New York accent seemed unbothered since she had never personally seen a rat.

'The rats come out at night. We're living in a big town. There's rats all over the place,' she said.

Another man said he wouldn't be visiting that location anymore while one woman said: 'Ew. That is disgusting'.
