It has been the society soirée of the season for countless years, and Lady Annabel Goldsmith's summer garden party didn't disappoint this year.

79-year-old Lady Annabel, mother to Zac Goldsmith MP and Jemima Khan, holds her annual party at Ormeley Lodge, the family’s elegant house in Ham, south-west London.

Known in London as a society hostess during the 60s and 70s, judging by last night's glamorous party, it seems that nothing has changed.

Attendees included the likes of Jemima Jones and Bunter Somerset, The Marquess of Worcester, as well as Prince Michael and Princess Michael of Kent.

Widow of Sir James Goldsmith and mother of Robin, India Jane, Jemima, Zac and Ben, Annabel is also grandmother to ten.

An extremely wealthy widow - her fortune is estimated at
around £1.48 billion- she is still a striking woman and it
is easy to see why she was the darling of London's fashionable,
rich, gambling Clermont set in the Sixties, which attracted such
people as Lord Lucan, Lord Lambton, Claus von Bulow and Bobby
Kennedy.

She was married for two decades to entrepreneur Mark Birley, the creator of iconic private member's club Annabel's, which she helped make a glamorous success.

In 1964, she embarked on a decade-long extramarital affair with the entrepreneur Sir James Goldsmith and gave birth to their daughter Jemima in 1974 and Zac in 1975.

Her last child Ben Goldsmith- whose divorce with Kate Goldsmith was one of the most public break-ups in recent memory- was born when she was 46 in 1980.

As a descendant and heiress of the 
Londonderry family, Lady Annabel's main job has been mothering her six children 
whose births span 25 years.

She is also an author and founder of the Democracy Movement, a Eurosceptic political advocacy group.
