The Duchess of Cambridge cut a sombre figure as she joined the Duchess of Cornwall and Sophie, Countess of Wessex, at the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, London, yesterday.

The pregnant royal watched on as the Queen and Prince William laid a wreath at the Cenotaph alongside senior Royals, veterans and the Prime Minister.

The 32-year-old wife of Prince William watched from the foreign office balcony because, as protocol dictates, those married into the Royal family, excluding Prince Philip, must watch from a distance.

Paying her respects: The Duchess of Cambridge sings during the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in London yesterday

Kate, wearing a black Alexander McQueen coat, looked thoughtful, perhaps thinking of her late grandfather Peter Middleton.

Mr Middleton, who passed away in 2010, trained Canadian pilots during the Second World War.  

Hundreds of services were held yesterday across Britain 100 years after the First World War broke out, 70 years after D-Day and weeks after British troops ended combat operations in Afghanistan.

In Afghanistan itself, there was a sombre atmosphere as Prince Harry returned to the country - where he was posted in 2007 and 2012 - to lead services with Britain's few remaining troops on behalf of the Queen.

In London, crowds gathered a dozen deep in a welcome respite from downpours which had swept across the south east, bringing with them ten days' rain in six hours.

The national remembrance service took place in Whitehall amid a heightened police presence.

Armed officers stood guard against the grey civil service buildings early in the morning as trained dogs sniffed under manhole covers to check for any signs of a terror plot.

Scotland Yard said it had an 'appropriate and proportionate' policing plan in place for the event amid heightened fears of a terror attack.

The thorough checks came after four men were arrested in west London and High Wycombe in connection with alleged Islamist terror plans on British soil on Thursday.

Royal ladies: The Duchess of Cambridge, The Duchess of Cornwall and the Countess of Wessex at the Cenotaph memorial in Whitehall, central London, during the annual Remembrance Sunday service held in tribute for members of the armed forces 

Support: Kate and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, attend the annual Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph where the royal family paid their respects 

But the service passed without incident, except for a young choirboy who collapsed as the national anthem was sung just yards from where the royal family were standing.

Medics rushed to treat the boy who was helped up and led away through the crowd, whose senior figures included 46 high commissioners from Commonwealth nations, each of whom laid a wreath.

A two-minute silence at 11am was due to be marked at the beginning and end by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery firing one round from one of their 13-pounder First World War guns from nearby Horse Guards Parade.

More than 10,000 veterans, some in wheelchairs, were applauded as they marched past the Cenotaph. At the close of the ceremony the Duke of York took the salute at Horse Guards Parade for the march-past.

It was also revealed yesterday that three years after their first transatlantic visit, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are returning to the US.

The Mail on Sunday revealed that William and Kate - who visited Los Angeles shortly after their wedding in 2011 - will embark on a three-day trip to New York next month to unveil their new charity, United For Wildlife.

And it seems likely they will take 16-month-old Prince George with them.

She is said to be 'very excited' about the forthcoming trip – her first visit to the city – having been desperate to see New York since she was a young girl.

The Duke and Duchess will meet conservationists to discuss illegal poaching and will also sit down with officials from international charities, including the World Wildlife Fund.

A spokesman for the charity said: 'We will be in New York to talk about our Wildlife Crime Project, which is why the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are involved.'

She is due to make two public appearances this week – the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium on Thursday, and a reception for her charity Place2Be.

A Palace spokesman said: 'Any overseas visit will be announced in the usual manner in due course.'
