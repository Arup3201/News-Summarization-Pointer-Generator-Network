A hundred years after the beginning of World War One, Britons are being asked to do their part in reading and tagging digitised diaries of soldiers who fought in France and Flanders.

Work is underway to unearth the details from diaries to build a more complete and personal picture of the conflict.

And Operation War Diary – an online crowdsourcing project – is relying on the public to fill in historical gaps and accurately tag diary entries that will help experts reveal how the war was really fought as well as serve as a memorial to all the people that lost their lives.

Work is underway to unearth the details from the diaries of World War one soliders to build a more complete and personal picture of the conflict. A new project will see 1.5million paged of Western Front war diaries digitised, tagged and put online

The First World War 100 portal, of which Operation War Diary is a part, is a massive digital project that will comprise more than 1.5million pages and bring individual’s experiences to a global audience.

The project is a collaboration between The National Archives, Imperial War Museums (IWM) and Zooniverse and is designed to create new ‘citizen historians’.

It is hoped that the project will make inaccessible information available to academics, researchers and family historians worldwide, leaving a lasting legacy for the centenary of the First World War.

Operation War Diary - an online crowdsourcing project - is relying on the public to fill in historical gaps, uncover hidden stories and accurately tag diary entries. Here is one of the entries from the unit war diaries that talks about the grim realities of war

The Zooniverse platform captures the place, date and time information you identify and then associates any tags you create with that core data.

This means that experts can see what happened to the unit, what people were mentioned, how many casualties there had been and what conditions were, within a specific time and location.

They can then use that information to create indexes – for example, from the names of people mentioned on a particular page, they can aggregate the date to provide an overview of different elements of life on the Western Front and academics can investigate specific questions using detailed and extensive data rather than small scale studies.

While the newly digitised 
unit war diaries tell tales of bravery as well as the miserable reality 
of daily life in the trenches, the Operation War Diaries project is also
 designed to uncover new tales and information of the extraordinary 
events between 1914 and 1919.

William
 Spencer, author and military records specialist at The National 
Archives said: ‘Making the First World War unit diaries available 
online, allows people across the world to discover the daily activities,
 stories and battles of each unit for themselves.

‘It also creates opportunities for the public, history enthusiasts, family historians and researchers worldwide to explore the official records which may lead to some new discoveries and perspectives of this important period of history.’

Operation War Diaries uses technology previously used to map stars to collect new accounts of World War One.

Users of the website are assigned a 
segment of a unit war diary and asked to tag key details from the pages,
 such as names, places and events.

The
 data entered by volunteers will be collected and used to enrich 
catalogue descriptions for the unit war diaries, enabling family 
historians around the world to trace their army ancestors and providing 
academics and researchers with a better understanding of how the war was
 fought.

This means that experts can see what happened to the unit, which people were mentioned, how many casualties there had been and what conditions were, within a specific time and location.

War
 diaries were kept to provide an accurate record of operations for 
preparing the official history of the war and to collect information 
that would help make improvements in preparing the army for war.

But they also contain a wealth of information of far greater interest than the army could ever have predicted.

They
 provide unrivalled insight into daily events on the front line, and are
 full of fascinating detail about the decisions that were made and the 
activities that resulted from them.

The
 National Archives has digitised the war diaries of the units under the 
command of the British and Indian cavalry and infantry divisions on the 
Western Front.

The war 
diaries are made up of a variety of different types of pages, including 
cover pages, title pages, orders, signals, maps, narrative reports and 
the main diary pages themselves.

Information gained through Operation War Diary will also be incorporated into IWM’s Lives of the First World War project, which will launch in spring.

By the end of the centenary it will become the permanent digital memorial to more than eight million men and women from across Britain and the Commonwealth, saving their stories for future generations.

Data gathered through Operation War Diary will be used to enrich the catalogue descriptions for the unit war diaries, provide evidence about the experience of named individuals in the IWM¿s Lives of the First World War project and gather large amounts of accurate data to help academics unravel how the war was fought.

A total of 100 unit war diaries are available on Operation War Diary, with more diaries to be added over the coming months.

Luke Smith, Digital Lead for IWM’s First World War Centenary Programme said: ‘Operation War Diary will uncover new first-hand information about day to day life in the First World War – information that may not have previously been communicated through letters home or covered in traditional history books.’
