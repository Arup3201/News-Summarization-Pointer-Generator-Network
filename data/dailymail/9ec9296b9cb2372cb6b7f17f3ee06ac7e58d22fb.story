Rolf Harris' 90-year-old brother today insisted that his younger sibling would 'never' have groped a make-up artist more than 20 times in a day.

Speaking to Southwark Crown Court via videolink from Sydney, Bruce Harris dismissed claims that Rolf had put his hands up a make-up artist's shorts as 'ridiculous', saying he would have shouted at his younger brother if he'd seen him do such a thing.

Bruce Harris, who became the artist and musician’s manager in 1981, dismissed the claims of a supporting witness who said Rolf Harris groped her as she did his make up for a television programme in Australia in the mid-1980s.

The idea that Rolf Harris repeatedly groped a make-up artist is 'ridiculous', his older brother Bruce, right, said. The 90-year-old, who became Rolf's manager, addressed Southwark Crown Court via video link from Sydney

The woman's testimony is not on the charge sheet because of where and when the alleged incident took place, but she was called as a supporting witness by the prosecution.

Rolf Harris, 84, of Bray, Berkshire, is accused of 12 counts of indecent assault on four women between 1968 and 1986, all of which he denies.

Today, his brother told jurors that he accompanied him to a television studio in Australia where the incident was alleged to have taken place, and said of the woman's claims: 'That's ridiculous.  He would never do that and I wouldn't let him do that, and he knew I wouldn't let him do that.

'That's just not possible.'

The freelancer, who was in her 20s at the time, said he repeatedly put his hands inside her baggy shorts as far as her hips while making a programme in Australia in the mid-1980s.

But Bruce Harris said: 'I would 
have shouted at him, I would have demanded that he stopped. But it never
 happened, it would never have been something that he would have done.

'I would have taken the elder brother approach to a younger brother misbehaving.'

The former advertising boss said he had never seen Rolf behaving inappropriately towards anyone.

‘I’ve never had any problems with that at all,’ he told the jury.  'I’ve never seen him do anything unpleasant to anybody really.

Rolf Harris arrived at court today accompanied by his daughter, Bindi Harris, left, and niece, Jenny Harris, right

‘Certainly I watched him perform with children - he
 and I had started a series of programmes over the years called School 
Special, where there were literally hundreds and hundreds of children.

‘He worked with them and was always very likeable and helpful in helping the children to perform.

‘Never did he do anything to cause any problems.’

One
 alleged victim, Tonya Lee, who has waived her right to anonymity, 
claimed Harris touched her intimately when she met him while touring 
Britain with an Australian youth theatre group.

Count 12: Indecent assault on fourth girl, 14, between 1/1/75 and 1/1/76

The former television presenter denies all the counts

Bruce Harris said the first he knew about the allegations against his brother was when Ms Lee gave a television interview about her claims last year.

He said he called the theatre group's artistic director, Kathy Henkel, to ask her whether she had seen what allegedly happened.

'In retrospect I kept on niggling away at her, saying "Surely you must have seen something",' he said.

'In Tonya’s documentary she went into great detail about what happened over a period of time, and I thought that Kathy must have seen something of this. So I kept trying to see. I didn’t put any pressure on her.'

He went on: 'I wasn’t trying to get her to change her story, if that’s what you mean, I was trying to see whether she could back up what this girl was saying.'

Under cross-examination by prosecutor Sasha Wass QC, he admitted that in the 'hypothetical' situation that Ms Henkel had supported the claims, he would not have told the police.

He said: 'I’m protective of my brother and I also wanted to see if there was any truth to what was being said. I didn’t believe it.'

The jury has already heard that Ms Henkel could not be certain about what happened on the night of the alleged assault, and that speaking to Bruce she claimed she 'felt pressured to say that it couldn’t have taken place'.

Bruce Harris repeatedly denied trying to influence her, and said if his brother had performed for the theatre group while they were having dinner together, he would have been most focused on doing his show.

'I can’t believe if he had done a show like that he would have had time or been bothered to do the kind of things that Tonya Lee has said,' he told the court.

Later, a retired tour manager who worked with Rolf Harris in the 1980s told the court how the entertainer was always 'quiet and nervous' before he went on stage.

Ken Jeacle, who was also speaking from Australia, said: 'Usually Rolf was quiet and rather nervous.

'He didn't appear to eat terribly much prior to a performance - he was quietly was assessing himself in readiness for the audience.'

The trial, which was adjourned until tomorrow, continues.
