Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has admitted he is a 'Neanderthal' who believes that men should not feel pressure to help bring up their own children.

The outspoken tycoon has vowed to improve his airline's notorious customer service - but in a bullish interview, he compared himself to Jesus and insisted Ryanair only punishes customers who fail to comply with its rules.

Mr O'Leary recently announced that Ryanair would introduce pre-assigned seating and overhaul its website in a bid to improve its reputation for rudeness to passengers.

'Neanderthal': Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has asserted his controversial traditionalist views

However, in an interview with The Times he showed that he had not completely reformed as he refused to back down from a number of controversial views.

He said that having to grant male staff statutory paternity leave drives him 'mad', pointing out that he never took time off following the births of his four children.

'I don't want to be at home with young babies, breastfeeding and changing nappies,' he said. 'That is not my function in life.

'This bonding stuff is rubbish. Men tend to bond with their children when they are walking, talking, following football - then we have something to say to them.'

He continued: 'What are men doing on the delivery ward? Once the contractions kick you are entirely bloody irrelevant.'

Mr O'Leary, 52, added that although he thinks women should always have the opportunity to work, he believes most would prefer to raise their children instead.

'We sow the seed, women have the babies and after that we provide,' he said. 'Most women, if given the choice, would actually stop working when they have young children.'

His wife Anita, 40, was an investment banker before giving up work to raise the couple's children.

He also denounced metrosexual trends such as men using moisturiser or carrying 'man bags', saying: 'I'm certainly not a new man. Neanderthal more like.'

The businessman has courted a reputation as a spiky, controversial figure, and he told The Times that most people see him as 'Jesus, Superman or an odious little s***'.

He said that he considers himself to be most like Jesus - but joked that like the lead character in Life of Brian he is in fact 'a very naughty boy'.

Queues: The airline penalises passengers who arrive at the airport without their boarding passes

Mr O'Leary admitted that the no-frills airline needs to improve its customer service, pledging to make its website easier to navigate and crack down on oversized fees for minor infringements such as forgetting a boarding pass.

But he still placed the blame on passengers who fail to follow instructions: 'I have always said that the customers who comply with the rules are always right.

'They don't moan. It's the customer who shows up not having checked in online who is a nightmare.'

He admitted he acts like a 'cheeky chappy', but said he never meant to be 'intentionally rude' and confessed that many of his outlandish suggestions about slashing services are nothing more than publicity stunts.

'I am soft, cuddly, misunderstood, with huge concern for my fellow human beings,' he said as he insisted Ryanair promoted European integration by making travelling cheaper.

Mr O'Leary also used the interview to call for three new airport runways to be built as he criticised the HS2 rail line and insisted that global warming is a myth.
