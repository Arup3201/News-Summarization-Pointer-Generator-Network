Andy Murray is not sure about Jonas Bjorkman's dancing but is confident the Swede will prove a valuable addition to his coaching team.

The 42-year-old is to join Murray for a trial week at some point in the next month with a view to working with the Scot on a permanent basis alongside his main coach Amelie Mauresmo.

The exact timing of that week is up in the air because Bjorkman is currently competing on Let's Dance, the Swedish version of Strictly Come Dancing.

Murray, whose mother Judy was a high-profile contestant on the last series of the British show, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'I haven't seen him dance yet but apparently he's one of the favourites to win so he must be all right.'

With Mauresmo only committed to working with Murray for 25 weeks a year, the world number four has made finding an additional coach a priority.

The role had been filled under Ivan Lendl and then Mauresmo by his long-time friend Dani Vallverdu until the pair went their separate ways at the end of last season.

The aim will be for Bjorkman to travel with Murray during the weeks when Mauresmo is unavailable, while they will also work together at certain times of the year.

Murray said: 'We've agreed for him to work with us for a week just to try and see how it goes. Normally when I've started working with coaches I've done that.

'I know him very well from when he played. He was one of the older guys when I came on the tour and he was very good to me. He's a very nice person, good sense of humour. And he was an exceptional tennis player who made the most of his ability.

'A lot of Swedes turn out to be good coaches. They've got a good mindset, they're very calm individuals and extremely hard workers. Hopefully when we try it out together it works well.'

Bjorkman reached number four in the singles rankings and number one in doubles, winning nine grand slam titles.

Since retiring in 2008 he has worked in the media, as a coach with Sweden's Davis Cup team and behind the scenes at the ATP tournaments in Bastad and Stockholm.

He becomes the latest Swede to take up a high-profile coaching role in men's tennis after Magnus Norman, who guided Stan Wawrinka to the Australian Open title last year, and Roger Federer's part-time mentor Stefan Edberg.

Bjorkman agreed with Murray's assessment of Swedish strengths but also said he hoped to bring energy and fun to training sessions.

Recalling how he became friends with Murray, Bjorkman said: 'I always spent quite a lot of time around Tim (Henman).

'When Andy came along, he was going to be the new superstar, I met him straight away and we connected well.

'He's a great guy, great sense of humour. Both of us like to have a little bit of a trash talk, we are interested in other sports. The only negative was he beat me twice. But I'm really looking forward to it.'

Bjorkman revealed he has been speaking to Mauresmo on the phone and believes they are singing from the same hymn sheet when it comes to Murray's game.

'It feels great,' he said. 'I really like the way she believes Andy should play and how they've been working.

'Andy's in a great situation now, he played phenomenal tennis in Australia. The match against (Tomas) Berdych I believe was the best since his injury. He's at his prime with his age and has some interesting years ahead of him.'

Murray and Mauresmo are currently in Indian Wells for the first Masters tournament of the season, where he will begin his campaign this weekend against Canadian Vasek Pospisil.

The Scot, meanwhile, has also committed to playing at the ATP tournament in Washington in August as part of his build-up to the US Open. He reached the final on his only previous appearance nine years ago.
