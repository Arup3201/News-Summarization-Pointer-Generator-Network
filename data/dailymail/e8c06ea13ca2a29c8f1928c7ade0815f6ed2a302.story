France's 
most famous brothel madam claimed John F Kennedy asked her for a 
prostitute who looked like his wife Jackie - 'but hot'.

The
 former President joins a host of famous names said to have visited 
Madame Claude, the infamous owner of a high-class escort ring who 
employed hundreds of women in 1960s Paris.

Claude,
 now 91 and living in France, specialized in procuring call girls - whom
 she referred to as her 'swans' - for the rich and famous, servicing 
everyone from the actors Rex Harrison and Marlon Brando to the Libyan 
dictator Muammar Gaddafi.

Sensational
 claims: France's most famous brothel madam was allegedly approached by 
former U.S. President John F Kennedy (left) who wanted a lookalike of 
his first wife Jackie, the fashion and style icon (right) - 'but hot'

Surprising: It comes despite Jackie, nee Bouvier, being one of the most enduring fashion icons of her age

Famous: Pictured during her self-imposed exile in Los Angeles in 1985, Madame Claude was a cult figure

Acclaimed
 biographer William Stadiem, who penned the famous book on Marilyn 
Monroe, persuaded Madame Claude to co-author a tell-all book in the 
1980s. Although it was never published, he has now has opened up about 
Claude and her roster of powerful clients.

Despite
 Jacqueline Kennedy being venerated as one of history's most elegant 
women, the explosive claims do not just involve her first husband.

Her
 second husband, the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, was also 
said to have visited Claude, along with his former lover Maria Callas; 
'showing up with depraved requests that made Claude blush.'

'There
 was John Kennedy requesting a Jackie look-alike "but hot",' Mr Stadiem 
wrote in Vanity Fair, describing Claude as being 'tiny, blonde, 
perfectly coiffed and Chanel-clad.'

'There
 was Marc Chagall giving the girls priceless sketches of their nude 
selves, Gianni Agnelli taking a post-orgy group to Mass, the Shah and 
his gifts of jewels.

'There were such disparate bedfellows on the client list as Moshe Dayan and Muammar Qaddafi, Marlon Brando and Rex Harrison.'

Iconic: Jacqueline and her first husband formed one of the most recognizable couples in U.S. history

Mr
 Stadiem also reveals that the C.I.A. once hired Claude's women to keep 
up morale during the Paris Peace Accords of 1973, which aimed to end 
U.S. military involvement in Vietnam.

'There are two things that people will always pay for, food and sex. I wasn't any good at cooking'

One of 
Claude's former loyal clients during the 50s and 60s was London's 
then-Spectator columnist Taki Theodoracopulos, who pointed out that 
'going to a hooker' wasn't frowned upon in the days 'before the pill.'

Claude
 is said to have chosen mainly tall, stunning, 'failed actresses and 
models' - many of them Christian Dior couture models -  and favored 
foreign girls, especially Scandinavians.

The
 brothel madam is quoted as saying: 'There are two things that people 
will always pay for, food and sex. I wasn't any good at cooking.'

The
 article investigates the fascinating journey of Madame Claude, born 
Fernande Grudet in 1923, and how she allegedly turned from a 
convent-raised resistance agent in the Second World War - who spent a 
stint at a German Nazi concentration camp, and apparently has the 'camp 
number tattoo' to prove it - to the head of France's biggest prostitute 
ring.

Many
 of the elaborate claims Claude made about her past, however, have been 
labeled as 'lies' and 'fantasy' by various sources who knew her.

'She reduced the entire world to rich men wanting sex and poor women wanting money'

Ironically
 given the X-rated nature of Claude's career, the eccentric character - 
mother to one daughter -  claimed to have 'hated sex,' and was of the 
opinion that people over 40 'shouldn't have it.' She was, however, a 
huge fan of plastic surgery, having had everything but her breasts 
'done.'

Having
 made herself a small fortune with her prostitution ring, Claude was 
forced to flee France for Los Angeles in 1977 when French authorities 
began hounding her over alleged tax evasion.

Though
 she continued working as a madam in the U.S., Claude was described as 
being 'totally alone and adrift' there. She lived in a small apartment 
in West Hollywood 'filled with wardrobes full of glamorous French 
clothes no one would ever wear in LA.'

Infamous: Madame Claude after her return to France

During
 her time in Los Angeles, Claude once attempted to enlist legendary 
actress and author Joan Collins as one of her 'swans.' In Ms Collins' 
1997 memoir Second Act, she described Claude's proposition.

'Your
 husbands don't have to know, and I believe you could make enough money 
to buy yourself a few little extra baubles,' Claude allegedly said.

Some of the associates Mr Stadiem spoke with were decidedly scathing when describing Claude.

In
 one account, Françoise Fabian - the actress who played Claude in the 
1977 film of her exploits - said she 'was like a slave driver on a 
plantation in the American South', who pushed the women who worked for 
her into debt.

Another
 account, from former-Hollywood based journalist Dany Jucaud was as 
follows: 'She was vicious... She reduced the entire world to rich men 
wanting sex and poor women wanting money.'

Eventually,
 Claude returned to her home country of France, endured a short jail 
term, and now lives a life shielded from the world.
