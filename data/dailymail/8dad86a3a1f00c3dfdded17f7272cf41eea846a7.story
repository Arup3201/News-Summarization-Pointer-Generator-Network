Carolina Sepe was shot in the head by a neighbour in her home town of Lauro, near Naples, last August.

She was ten weeks pregnant at the time and the 25-year-old was left in a coma.

Last month doctors at the Naples hospital she was being treated in performed a caesarean section to save her baby daughter, after her vital signs grew weaker.

She died on Saturday, 16 days after the birth of the baby, who weighs just 1.1kg and is being kept on life support, according to the Daily Telegraph.

The mayor of Lauro, Antonio Bossone, said the town will support the child, named Maria Liliana, ‘to help her grow and to guarantee a serene future’, the paper reported.

The August 25 murder was carried out by Domenico Aschettino, whose primary target was Carolina’s father, Vincenzo, who he shot in the wake of a row over a car accident.

He burst into the family home and fatally wounded Vincenzo with a pistol.

He then turned his gun on other family members. Carolina’s brother and mother were wounded and her grandmother fatally injured.

Carolina’s husband, Giampiero Siniscalchi, escaped the massacre with the couple’s two-year-old son, Eliseo, by clambering out of a bathroom window.

After quitting his job he held a daily bedside vigil for Carolina, always believing that she would recover.

He described to Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera how he played a recording of their son to her and noticed tears rolling down her cheeks.

He said: ‘I am sure my wife can hear me and hear the voice of our son.’

Aschettino has tried to commit suicide in jail following his arrest.
