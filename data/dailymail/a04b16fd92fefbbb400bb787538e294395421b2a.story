Anthony Crolla will go toe-to-toe with Richar Abril for the WBA World Lightweight title at the Phones 4u Arena in Manchester on January 23.

'To have the world title shot in Manchester is a huge factor,' said Crolla.

The 28-year-old is looking forward to fighting Richar Abril in his hometown of Manchester 

'Without wanting to sound cheesy, it doesn't get any bigger than that. I am a Manchester lad so to be fighting in Manchester for a world title, I couldn't ask for anything more and the only way it could get better than that is to go out there and win it.

'I have been watching a bit of Abril over the last year because we have been linked with a fight before, but I will watch a lot more of him. He is a very good champion, he is avoided for a reason. 

'He came on to the scene when he fought Brandon Rios and everybody except the judges that night could see he won clearly. He is a very good fighter, a well-schooled amateur and nice and relaxed.

'It is a very big ask but there will be a few factors in my favour like being in my hometown which will bring an extra 25 per cent out of me. 

'In training I will have an extra edge to me because I won't have a problem getting out of bed in the morning knowing there is a world title at stake.

'I really believe deep down that I can win that fight and become a world champion. I am under no illusions, it is a tough fight and I go in a big underdog. But it is a fight I am capable of winning and the setting couldn't be any better. To do it in front of my home fans really is the stuff dreams are made of.'
