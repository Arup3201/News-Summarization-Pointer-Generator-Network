Sibling rivalries can be intense at the best of times.

But its doubtful that they get quite as competitive as that between Dutch brothers Tobias and Jamiro Mathijsen.

After returning from a holiday in Italy last week, Jamiro was left stunned to discover his older brother Tobias had appeared to tilt his bedroom 90 degrees.

Normal: The rivalry between two Dutch brothers resulted in Tobias Mathijsen tilting his brother's bedroom 90 degrees. Tobias had already turned his Jamiro's room pink. This is how it originally looked

Tilted: When Jamiro returned from his holiday last Wednesday late at night, his room looked like this

Altered: Jamiro was completely surprised and shocked by the room's transformation. He told his brother: 'I do not understand why i deserve this'

And just to add to his embarrassment, Tobias filmed his reaction as he entered the room late at night last Wednesday.

Discovering his bed and other precious items such as his guitar fixed firmly on the wall, he said: 'I did not do anything bad this time. I do no understand why I deserve this.

'Just how did you?'.

The pranks between the two brothers started after Jamiro altered his older brother's Facebook page, in what was described as an 'embarrassing way'.

So, Tobias decided to exact his revenge by transforming his younger brother's room into a girl's room by painting it completely pink.

Pranksters: The practical jokes between the brothers started when Jamiro Mathijsen, right, altered his older brother Tobias' Facebook page in an embarrassing way

Transformation: Tobias enlisted the help of his friends to begin transforming the room to make it appear as though it has been tilted 90 degrees

Ambitious: The room was completely emptied and decorated before the contents were fixed onto the walls

But, one year on, with his brother on holiday again, Tobias decided it was too good an opportunity to miss.

Speaking in a video he prepared for the prank, he said: 'Even though he did nothing wrong this time I cannot resist the urge to change his room again. We are going to tilt his room 90 degrees.'

With the help of some friends, the group begin to decorate and completely alter the room.

The guitar and bed were fixed against a wall with another wall painted white to make it appear as though it is the ceiling.

Surprised: Jamiro can be seen entering the room after returning from his holiday in Italy

Smiling: Jamiro could see the funny side of the prank

Threat: A stunned Jamiro also warned his brother that he would take his revenge

When Jamiro enters the room he is initially speechless. The only noise is the stifled giggles of his older brother.

A shocked Jamiro says: 'Just how did you' and 'oh no' before adding: 'I understand how to get a pink room back to normal but I do not know how to fix this.'

And in a sign that this is not the end of the feud, he warns his delighted brother: 'You do know that I am really going to get you back for this.'
