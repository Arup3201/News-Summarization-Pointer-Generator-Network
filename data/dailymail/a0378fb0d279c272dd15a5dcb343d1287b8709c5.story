Detectives are investigating three decades of alleged sexual abuse at a top London public school, it emerged today.

The Metropolitan Police are looking into historical claims of abuse at St Paul's boys' school and its prep school, Colet Court, after a number of pupils who attended the school between the 1960s and 1980s were said to have come forward with new information.

The inquiry comes just months after a classics teacher at Colet Court resigned his post after he was arrested and bailed on suspicion of possession of indecent images.

Another former teacher at the school has also been arrested and bailed as part of the investigation.

Chancellor George Osborne and Attorney
 General Dominic Grieve QC are among the school's most famous former 
pupils, although there is no suggestion either were victims of abuse.

Police confirmed they made their first arrest last summer before bringing a second man into custody earlier this year.

A
 spokesman said: 'We can confirm that the Child Abuse Investigation Team
 at Feltham is investigating historic allegations of sexual abuse 
alleged to have taken place between the 1960s and 1980s. 

'On 27 February, a 65-year-old man was 
arrested in connection with the investigation. He was taken into custody
 and subsequently bailed to return pending further inquiries. Next due 
on a date in early May.

'Previously, on 10 September 2013, a 57-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of possession of indecent images. He has been bailed until a date in late April.

'We are aware of a number of potential victims and witnesses who we wish to speak to over the course of the investigation. Inquiries continue.'

The men arrested were today named by The Times as classics teacher and former administration director at Colet Court, Anthony Fuggle, 57, who resigned his post this academic year, and former geography teacher and rowing coach Patrick Marshall, 65, who denies any wrongdoing.

The investigation into Mr Fuggle is believed to have been sparked when photographs of boys were found on a school computer during IT checks.

Parents and former pupils have been sent a letter by the school, which says it is assisting police with their inquiries.

The school was founded in 1509 and moved from its original site near St Paul's Cathedral to its current riverside campus in Barnes, south west London in 1968.

According to its website, fees are £10,411 for a term of boarding and £6,951 per term of days. An Ofsted inspection in March 2013 described quality of learning at the school as 'exceptional'.
