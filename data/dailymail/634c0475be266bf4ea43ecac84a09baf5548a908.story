A rise in the number of stolen smart phones and tablet computers is behind the first increase in property crime for 20 years, leaked figures show.

The data suggests austerity measures have led to an increase in crime, and show a rise in muggings and burglary with thieves targetting smartphones and tablets during thefts.

Police have also reported an upturn in shoplifting with a number of first-time offenders arrested for stealing food such as milk, cheese and meat.

The shift in the figures is a particular trend in the north of England, with instances of reported crime in the south remaining largely constant.

However, there is a fear that the pattern could spread to the rest of the country.

Chief constables from across the country have now been summoned to a meeting with Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor to discuss the 'disturbing trends' in crime figures. 

Figures collated between April and 
September show that all crimes recorded by forces in the north west of 
England have risen by 2.3per cent, according to Police Professional 
Magazine.

Victim based crime is up 4.3per cent in the region, which covers forces in Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire, Cheshire and Cumbria, and general theft is 7.8per cent higher than it was last year.

The reported figures, which were revealed at the Association of Chief Police Officers autumn conference and have not been compiled by the Office For National Statistics, also show that reports of burglary have increased by 5.3per cent, vehicle crime by 4.9per cent, and shoplifting by 10.7per cent.

In Merseyside alone, shoplifting offences have risen by 17.6per cent, and theft in Manchester has gone up by 17per cent, with the figure even higher in areas of the city populated by students.

Sir Peter Fahy, chief constable of Greater Manchester Police, said his force has seen an increase in thefts of expensive smartphones and tablets, especially in student areas.

There have been instances of concert audiences having their phones snatched as they hold them up to film the musicians, and gadgets have also been pinched from tables in coffee shops where customers can access free wifi.

'If you look at the last few months, it is definitely on the rise but it is largely acquisitive crime,' Sir Peter said at the conference.

In West Yorkshire the number of overall crime reports have fallen, although the force reported an increase in acquisitive crime, such as shoplifting.

Chief Constable Mark Gilmore said: 'As austerity measures take hold, people are committing offences to put money in their pockets.'

Across the whole of England and Wales , victim based crime is up 0.4per cent, and general theft has increased by 1.3per cent.

Over the last 20 years official crime figures have been falling, with the British Crime Survey for this year declaring that its estimate was the lowest since the study began in 1981.

The latest survey, released in March, suggested that the total number of reported incidents was 15per cent lower than it had been in 2007/8, and less than half the highest tally recorded in 1995.

According to the survey, the police recorded 3.7 million offences in the year ending June 2013, a decrease of 5per cent compared with the previous year.

Steve Finnigan, Chief Constable of Lancashire and the national police representative on performance, told The Times: 'We've got to wait until we have a full year's figures, but there are some quite disturbing trends.

'Nobody is panicking but the sensible and professional thing to do is to try and understand what is the root cause of the things we've seen.'

Mr Finnigan said he had been told by leading officers from across England and Wales that there was an increase in the numbers of people being arrested for stealing basic foodstuffs, such as milk and meat.

Many of the first-time offenders said they had stolen simply to put food on the table.

The Home Office said that crime figures had fallen both across the country as a whole and in the north west.

'We have two independent measures of crime and both show overall levels falling,' said a spokesman.

'In the North West police recorded crime has fallen by 17per cent since June 2010, while West Yorkshire has seen a drop of 15per cent in the same period. 

'It is for chief constables to take all appropriate action against crime in their areas and for PCCs to ensure forces are delivering on the issues that matter to local people.'
