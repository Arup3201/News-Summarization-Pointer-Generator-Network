The intern at a leading investment bank who died after reportedly working punishingly long hours had modelled himself on Gordon Gekko, the ruthless trader in the film Wall Street.

Moritz Erhardt, 21 – described by his parents as their ‘sunshine’ – had written in an online CV that he was driven to ‘be the best all the time’.

The body of the German student was found in a shower at his East London flat last Thursday by friends.

Friends of German student Moritz Erhardt, 21, (left) who died while employed as an intern at Bank of America Merill Lynch, said he modelled himself on Gordon Gekko (right), played by Michael Douglas in Wall Street

He had been nearing the end of a seven-week internship with the Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch Investment Bank Division.

Friends claimed he worked an ‘all-nighter’ shift eight times in only two weeks. It is thought he had been trying to impress bosses and collapsed after having an epileptic fit or seizure.

Yesterday his father Dr Hans-Georg Dieterle and mother Ulrike travelled to London from their home in the town of Staufen Im Breisgau, close to the German-Swiss border.

Dr Dieterle, a psychoanalyst and personal life coach, issued a brief statement in which he said: ‘Moritz was our sunshine. His plan was to work really hard for a few years and to do something good afterwards.’

A former friend told how Mr Erhardt, who had recently completed a study abroad programme at the University of Michigan, had clearly been driven when at school in Germany.

‘A lot of the boys dreamed of being someone like Boris Becker or the footballer Michael Ballack, but Moritz always said he wanted to model himself on the Gordon Gekko character from Wall Street,’ said the friend, who did not want to be named.

Mr Erhardt was near the end of his seven-week summer internship with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International in London when he died

Gekko, with his striped braces and slicked-back hair, became a symbol of Eighties greed.

Michael Douglas, who played him, won the best actor Oscar for the 1987 film.

As Mr Erhardt's parents arrived in London, a former secondary school teacher of their son spoke about how he had warned the conscientious student not to focus solely on work and money.

Mr Erhardt's parents said he was their 'sunshine' and wanted to 'work really hard and do something good afterwards'

Winfried Sturm, 68, a physics teacher at the Faust Gymnasium school, who was named Germany's Teacher of the Year in 2004, is quoted in The Times saying that Erhardt gave everything 100 per cent; 'he was incredibly single-minded,' he said.

The teacher, who beat cancer in his 40s, brought on he believes by the self-induced pressure to succeed, went on to say: 'I gave him some guidance for a happy and healthy life: if you are always working to make money, and you have no other time, it is not good.'

In an online CV Mr Erhardt said he had a ‘persistent aspiration’ to succeed and had been ‘highly competitive and ambitious’ from early on.

He wrote that at school he played soccer, tennis, athletics and skiing, adding: ‘Sometimes, I had a tendency to be over ambitious, which resulted in severe injuries.

'With respect to my performance in school, I was striving for excellence and trying to be the best all the time.’

Mr Erhardt had been staying in student accommodation in Bethnal Green.

Another student said: ‘Apparently he pulled eight all-nighters in two weeks. They get you working crazy hours and maybe it was just too much for him.’

On the wallstreetoasis.com website, which revealed his death but did not name him, one poster called LH Dan wrote: ‘There’s a lot of pressure which leads you to not always make the best decisions ... You’re trying your hardest to prove yourself worthy of a full-time offer and it can be easy to neglect your health and sanity.’

Merrill Lynch has allegedly told staff not to talk about Mr Erhardt’s work patterns or death but one fellow intern said: ‘You would not find a harder worker. He seemed a lovely guy and was tipped for greatness.’
