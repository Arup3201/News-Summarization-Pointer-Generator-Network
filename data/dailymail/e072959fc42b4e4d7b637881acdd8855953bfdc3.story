With stunts that seemingly defy gravity, Andreu Lacondeguy has been crowned the king of the prestigious Red Bull Rampage competition.

Showcasing tricks and turns in the stunning setting of the Southern Utah landscape in Virgin, the Spanish mountain-biker broke his curse of three years of coming fourth to scoop the top spot.

Considered the pinnacle of freeride mountain biking, the event was open to 20 competitors, with Lacondeguy, 25, from Barcelona, captured on this incredible footage.

Set amongst the picturesque Southern Utah landscape, the competition features the biggest stars in the sport completing impressive runs that combine speed, style and big tricks. 

Andreu topped the field with one of the steepest and most difficult runs possible, capping it off with a flatspin backflip.

Previous Rampage champion Cam Zink earned Best Trick accolades, presented by the Utah Spots Commission, for his massive 360 drop from 60 feet off a cliff. 

Cam also placed second overall.

Canadian rider Brandon Semenuk earned third place and the People's Choice award after performing several impressive tricks on his bike.

The new course, comprised of stunning rock formations and desert landscape, was essentially an open canvas for the athletes.

Alongside a team of builders, the bikers shaped their runs 10 days previously, working their way down 1,000 vertical feet of cliffs.

Athletes were judged not just on their breath-taking tricks, but also on the difficulty of the route they choose. Speed and style were also considered.

Although nerves were running high, Andreu's first run proved all he needed to take home the coveted first place prize.

'I knew I needed that extra little bit to be on the top and this year, I just picked the steepest line,' he said. 'As soon as I hard the countdown, I just got out of the cage and pinned it to the bottom.'

Though he went up to prepare for his second run, the rest of the riders were unable to beat his score.

Realising he'd won, Andreu put down his bike and wiped away tears.
