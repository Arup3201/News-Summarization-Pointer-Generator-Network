A soldier was allegedly kidnapped and sexually assaulted by four women for nearly a week before being stoned and dumped in a mountain range.

The 25-year-old victim's ordeal started when he took up the offer of a lift to the city of Mutare in Zimbabwe.

Two women and a man were in the car, a Mercedes Benz, and, after driving for about an hour towards the city, the driver diverted from the route.

When the victim complained, he was threatened with a knife.

Manicaland police spokesman, Assistant Inspector Nuzondiwa Clean, told Zimbabwean paper NewsDay: 'After diverting from the route, the complainant asked where they were heading to and they told him they were going to get some food.

'The soldier requested to be dropped, but the driver produced a knife and threatened him with it. One of the female passengers blindfolded the complainant with a black cloth.'

According to Mr Clean, they then took the complainant to an unknown house where they undressed him and took away his phone and $35.

The suspects ordered the man to be intimate with one of the women on several occasions and he was held between April 19-23.

He was then blindfolded again and dropped in the Dangamvura Mountains when, according to police, he was stoned on his left foot, causing a serious injury.

The suspect then drove off.

The soldier made a report at Sakubva Police Station, prompting investigations, and the suspects are now being hunted.
