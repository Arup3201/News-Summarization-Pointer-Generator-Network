The first 100 days of a Ukip government are to be imagined in a spoof documentary to be aired by Channel 4 before the election. 

Producers claim they want to explore the effects of the Eurosceptic party's policies on Britain ahead of polling day, when Ukip is planning to target 100 seats across the country.

The programme will follow a new Ukip MP as she arrives in Westminster with the aim of taking the UK out of the European Union but one question is as yet unanswered: Who will play Nigel Farage?

The spoof documentary will examine the impact of Nigel Farage taking the keys of Number 10 as Prime Minister in a Ukip government after May's general election

The decision to commission the programme is further recognition of the extraordinary rise in support for Ukip.

One poll this week put Mr Farage's party on 19 per cent, a record high and well above the 3 per cent secured at the 2010 election.

The party gained its first MP - Douglas Carswell - in a by-election this month, and is expected to be joined by Mark Reckless, another Tory defector, on November 20.

Mr Farage has upped his ambitions, and Ukip's biggest donor has promised to target 100 seats at the next election.

Such a move could secure several more Ukip MPs, and deprive Tory MPs of a majority.

Even Mr Farage admits the prospect of him becoming Prime Minister is a distant one. But it will be the central premise of the Channel 4 programme, 100 Days of Ukip.

The one-off 'What-If' drama will examine the impact of Ukip actually winning the general election in May 2015.

100 Days of Ukip will be broadcast in the spring, ahead of polling day. But there are as yet no details of the cast, and no hint about who will play Mr Farage. 

Today Mr Farage said he had been told about the programme, but asked by MailOnline who he would like to play him in the drama, replied: 'No comment.' 

A surge in support for Ukip has put Mr Farage at the centre of the media spotlight, and under more intense scrutiny

Ukip has jumped four points to 19 per cent - one point above their previous highest rating in a ComRes telephone poll in June

Raw TV, which is producing the show, said it will be 'set in a possible future where Nigel Farage's party has continued its exponential rise to power, the film projects what could actually happen if UKIP were to gain power in next year's election'.

The programme will use both members of the public and actors to film scripted scenes  which will be woven together with real-life archive from news programmes. 

Channel 4 Head of Documentaries Nick Mirsky said: 'This is a very exciting commission from a team known for brave and thought-provoking television.' 

In recent days Ukip has been bolstered by the huge row over the demand that Britain pays an extra £1.7billion to the EU by December 1, rising to 19 per cent in a ComRes survey for The Independent.

Executive producer Richard Bond said: 'With support for Ukip growing in the polls, this is timely exploration of the effect their policies might have on Britain.'

With Channel 4 yet to cast its Ukip spoof documentary, speculation has mounted about who will play Nigel Farage.

The Ukip insists he has not given it any thought. But Twitter spoof account @GeneralBoles was quick to mock up Ray Winston in a pinstripe suit with a purple rosette.

Bookies, meanwhile, have installed Michael Sheen as 3/1 favourite, after successfully playing Tony Blair three times, including in the 2006 film The Queen.

By contrast Brad Pitt is on 500,/1, Russell Brand 100/1 and Eddie Izzard 100/1.

Matthew Shaddick of Ladbrokes said: 'Sheen fits the bill perfectly but if they want a hapless Prime Ministerial performance, Hugh Grant has some form at 33/1. 

'We suspect Brad Pitt might have more suitable projects lined up, so needless to say he's the rank outsider.'
