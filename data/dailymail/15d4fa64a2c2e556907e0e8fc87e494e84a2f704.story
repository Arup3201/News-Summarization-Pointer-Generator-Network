Ahead of Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday night between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks, Vernon Kay reflects on some of his favourite memories from the showpiece event. 

3. New York Giants 39-20 Denver Broncos - Super Bowl XXI, January 25, 1987 

This was the year I really got into American football and I knew the rules and what to look out for. The sun setting over the iconic Rose Bowl in California made the whole event look beautiful. 

I remember watching up to the end of the first quarter and had school the next morning. But my mum stayed up and recorded the game on VHS but paused the adverts, because if you didn’t pause the adverts you wouldn’t get the whole game on one tape. 

That Super Bowl started a period of about 10 years where my mum or dad would pause the adverts to get it all on a VHS video. In that game we saw John Elway and Lawrence Taylor and two iconic teams. That’s one Super Bowl I remember for it’s visual beauty.

2. Pittsburgh Steelers 27-23 Arizona Cardinals - Super Bowl XLIII, February 1, 2009

This was the first Super Bowl I watched live and I was fortunate enough to be sat just over the end zone when Ben Roethlisberger threw the final touchdown to win the game for the Steelers. Little did I know that the wide receivers coach for the London Warriors, Marvin Allen, was on that squad and he won a Super Bowl ring in that game.

1. Chicago Bears 46-10 New England Patriots - Super Bowl XX, January 26, 1986

This was the first American game that I ever saw. It was one of the best defenses that had ever played the game. I wasn’t aware at the time, but as I slowly taught myself about the history of the game, I realised that Bears defense was one of the best to play the game. 

It was also the first time I saw Walter Payton run the football and they had William Perry aka 'The Fridge'. That was the season that made him a household name, even in Britain.
