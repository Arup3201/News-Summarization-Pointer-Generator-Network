Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard has included former Arsenal stars Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Dennis Bergkamp in his FIFA 15 'legends' XI.

Hazard was not afraid of choosing three ex-players from one of his side's London rivals when he was asked to construct a team made up of former stars.

The 23-year-old, who scored in Chelsea's 3-1 Capital One Cup win against Derby on Tuesday night, named just one former Blue in his team.

Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel has been included in Hazard's FIFA XI with 'the best left back ever' Roberto Carlos, ex-Chelsea captain Marcel Desailly, Laurent Blanc and Fabio Cannavaro making up the defence.

Luis Figo, Pavel Nedved, Vieira and Pires were chosen to play in midfield with Bergkamp in the hole.

Hazard has chosen Bergkamp's fellow countryman Patrick Kluivert to lead the line as he enjoyed playing alongside the Dutchman during his time at former side Lille.
