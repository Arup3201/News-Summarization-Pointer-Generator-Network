These jaw-dropping pictures show the moment a bright flash of lightning strikes through the center of an eerie, UFO-shaped cloud.

The unusual clouds filled the skyline over farmland near Broken Bow, Nebraska, during an incredible supercell thunderstorm.

Freelance photographer Vanessa Neufield, 36, couldn't believe her luck when she caught the amazing lightning strike on camera.

The bizarre UFO-shaped phenomenon is created by a rapid updraft of warm air, which creates a cyclone with winds as fast as 170mph

Ms Neufield, from Calgary in Alberta, Canada, said: 'Getting the shot through the clouds was luck and great timing.

'The lightning was very consistent and I just set my camera up at a nice exposure for the natural light on the event of a strike.

'Then I got very lucky.'

The unusual shaped clouds are part of a low precipitation supercell storm where updrafts of air rotate around a vertical axis, creating UFO-like shapes.

The formations last for around 30 to 40 minutes, eventually becoming smaller until they disappear.

Ms Neufield said: 'The power of nature fills me with awe.

Supercell storms can happen anywhere in the world, but they are most commonly found in the Midwest of the U.S., as well as the plains areas of South America.

'I'm a photographer so I'm extremely visual and there is nothing more stunning than a storm to me and I'm right in my element then.

'I have seen and photographed many tornadoes but the storms that produce great cloud structure and lightning instead are my favorite.

'Lighting sometimes scares me more than a tornado.

'I usually can't tell how close I'm getting to where the lightning is but I'm usually very careful and have thankfully only had one close call.'

A supercell, which is not always a thunderstorm, is a weather phenomenon in which converging low level winds create an updraft which rotates on a vertical axis. This is also known as a mesocyclone.

Warm air in the mesocyclone can rise as fast as 170mph.

Supercells are known to create large hailstones, damaging winds, and tornadoes, and can last for hours if conditions permit.

These kind of storms can take place anywhere in the world, but are most commonly found in the Midwest of the United States, as well as the plains areas of South America.
