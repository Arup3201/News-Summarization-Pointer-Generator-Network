Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti revealed his surprise after La Liga rivals Barcelona suffered a shock defeat byMalaga as his side opened up a four-point lead at the top.

Barcelona had been on an 11-game winning streak before succumbing to a 1-0 reverse at the Nou Camp on Saturday, a defeat compounded by Real's 2-0 win away to Elche the following day.

And former Chelsea boss Ancelotti admitted he didn't foresee the Catalan giants slipping up, but remains convinced the race for the title will go down to wire despite the four-point advantage his side currently hold.

'It was an important game after what happened to our rivals on Saturday and above all to take a bigger lead over Barcelona,' Ancelotti told reporters.

'It is clear that their defeat surprised everyone, as Barca had been in very good form, playing very well.

'We do have a lead now, but as I have said many times this title will be decided on the last day of the season.'

Since suffering a humiliating 4-0 derby defeat by Atletico Madrid earlier this month, Real have responded with three consecutive victories without conceding a goal and Ancelotti was delighted with the clean sheet against Elche in what was his 100th game in charge of the Champions League winners.

'After Atletico we have improved on our defensive work. Elche's players have got great quality, but we have not allowed them to prove it. I had no doubts that we would win this game.

'These 100 games with Real Madrid have gone well.

'But I hope to improve in the next 100 and with the attitude of this game we will win many more. We have been focused and everyone has worked very well.
