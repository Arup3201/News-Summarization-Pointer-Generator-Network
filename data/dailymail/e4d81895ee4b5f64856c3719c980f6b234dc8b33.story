The sprawling estate rented by Barack Obama and his family for the last three summers has been sold for an eye-watering $22million to the globally-renowned British architect Norman Foster.

The impressive Blue Heron Farm on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard sprawls over an enormous 29 acres of waterfront, houses two full-size homes, a pool, hot tub and golf course.

The architect of London’s Wembley Stadium and the Gherkin will also find a tennis and basketball court, an equestrian facility complete with eight-stall horse barn and an apple orchard.

Interior: One of the many rooms which occupies just one of the two houses on the sprawling Blue Heron Farm estate on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard

Yale University graduate Lord Foster, 
76, is behind such U.S. masterpieces the Hearst Tower in New York, 
Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the AT&T Performing Arts Center in 
Dallas, Texas.

Meanwhile, he also designed Two World Trade Center on the Ground Zero site. Foundation work began on the property in June last year and it will eventually reach a height of 1,349ft, or 88 stories.

Lord Foster's tax residence is in Switzerland and he left the UK House of Lords as a crossbencher - without political party allegiance - in July last year in order to protect his 'non-dom' tax status.

The architect's new home also boasts a 
five-bedroom Victorian farm house, a vast space of gardens, a 
reconstructed 150-year-old Pennsylvania hay barn and an oversized shed 
from Vermont.

Lord Foster’s purchase of the house - 
in conjunction with his Spanish-born wife, publishing magnate Lady Elena
Foster - was completed in two separate deeds, reported the Martha’s 
Vineyard Gazette.

There is also beach access on 
Squibnocket Pond and a vista of Tiah's Cove. The purchase price is among
the highest ever paid for a single-family home on Martha’s Vineyard.

Luxury: The property looks out on to lush landscapes and generous waterfronts in Massachusetts

House two: The other building situated on the property, which was on the market for $23.7million

The sale was handled Tom Wallace of 
Wallace & Co. Sotheby's International Realty, who also handled 
rentals to President Obama’s family when they came to stay in the 
summer.

The Blue Heron Farm was named by former owner and philanthropist M. Anthony Fisher after the bird that is native to the area.

The Manhattan real estate developer is responsible for making the property what it is today.

After buying it in 1991, he and his 
wife Anne added the individual touches to the property over the years, 
making the lush landscape fit for a king - or even a U.S. President.

But after he and his wife tragically died 
in an airplane crash in Massachusetts in 2003, it was sold to William 
and Mollie Van Devender for $20.35million, reported AOL.

The Van Devenders are staunch Republicans - with Mr Van Devender donating $2,300 to John McCain's campaign in 2008.

But they obviously did not let it get 
in the way of their business ventures as they rented it out to the 
Obamas for a reported $75,000-a-week for the last three summers.

They put the property on the market 
for $23.7million because they wanted to spend less time on the island 
and on the U.S. West Coast instead, reported the Martha’s Vineyard Gazette.

Family time: U.S. President Barack Obama rides alongside his daughter Malia during a family vacation there

Sprawling: Wallace & Co. will manage the property but it is believed the Fosters are not going to rent it out

Former President Bill Clinton and his 
wife U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also attended Blue Heron 
Farm for dinner in 1998 when they were in the White House, hosted by the
Fishers.

Wallace & Co. will continue to 
manage the property but have implied the Fosters are not going to rent
it out - so it looks like the Obamas are going to have to find 
another holiday home.

Lord Foster has several residences in 
North American and abroad, with his business Foster + Partners based in 
London. He was granted a knighthood in 1990 and a life peerage in 1999.

Lady Foster - who also bought a 
0.3-acre beachfront lot on the island for $475,000 - is an academic 
psychologist who founded an arts publishing house, reported the Martha’s
Vineyard Gazette.
