The owner of the St. Louis Rams has announced intentions to build a massive new NFL stadium and entertainment complex in the Los Angeles suburb of Inglewood.

Stan Kroenke revealed the grand plan to the LA Times on Monday. In addition to an 80,000-seat stadium, the billionaire and his partners are proposing an adjacent 6,000-seat performance venue. 

Los Angeles was home to the Rams from 1946 to 1994 and, as St. Louis scrambles to come up with a plan for a new stadium in order to retain the team, the City of Angels appears ever more likely to get a pro football team after two decades without one.

Returning to LA? St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke has announced grand plans for an 80,000 seat NFL stadium in Los Angeles. The Rams called LA home from 1946 to 1994

Kroenke and his Rams currently have a 30-year lease at St. Louis' outdated Edward Jones Dome. Unless the city reaches an agreement on a new venue with Kroenke by March, he has the option of converting the lease to month-to-month.

The Rams' lease requires the Edward Jones Dome to remain among the top quarter of the 32 NFL stadiums, based on various criteria. 

The Rams and St. Louis remain $575 million apart in the negotiations, the LA Times reports. The city along with Governor Jay Nixon were expected to announce a proposal by the end of January.  

To help make his gleaming plans a reality, Kroenke has partnered with Stockbridge Capital Group, who own the 238-acre Hollywood Park racetrack adjacent to the Ignlewood plot where Kroenke intends to place his so-called City of Champions Revitalization Project.

'We are excited to unveil an expanded plan that will bring a world-class sports and entertainment district to Hollywood Park,' Stockbridge founder Terry Fancher told the LA Times in a statement. 'We are committed to working with [the Kroenke Group] to build a project that will put Inglewood back on the map as home of the truly great sports and entertainment venues.'

Speculation about Kroenke's intentions has run rampant since he purchased the land one year ago, meanwhile this newest Los Angeles NFL stadium proposal is among two others that currently have clearance to be built.

One is the Farmers Field proposal located in downtown Los Angeles. The other is real estate billionaire Ed Roski's proposal in City of Industry, the LA Times reports.

While these two projects are ahead of the game in terms of bureaucratic hurdles, neither project is backed by a team owner as Kroenke's is.

However, as the LA Times notes, the threat of moving to Los Angeles has been a powerful team owners have leveraged in the past to entice their home cities and states into okaying new stadium deals. 

Kroenke and his associates say they plan to have enough signatures to get the proposal on Inglewood's municipal ballot in 2015.

Outgrowing St. Louis? The city of St. Louis has until March to come up with plans for an updated stadium or the Rams can convert their lease to month-to-month
