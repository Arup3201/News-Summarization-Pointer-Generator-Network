American fugitive Edward Snowden has made a rare public appearance in Moscow, visiting The Tsar's Bride opera at Bolshoi Theatre.

Snowden's appearance coincides with his lawyer's confirmation the US fugitive's residency in Russia has been extended another three years.

Russian websites claim to have spotted Snowden making his public appearance to mark a year since was given asylum in Russia.

'Journalists nearly missed him in his disguise - perhaps because he came to watch a tragic love story from Russia in the times of Ivan the Terrible without his usual spectacles,' said a vesti.ru website.

The former CIA contractor is shown smiling and looking relaxed in a snapshot at the theatre, said the pro-Kremlin news outlet.

Until now the only glimpses of Snowden in Moscow since he was granted asylum a year ago have shown him pushing a supermarket trolley and on a tourist boat on the Moscow River.

The site said Snowden's Russian lawyer Anatoly Kucherena explained Snowden lived a 'measured life, reading Russian classical prose, actively learning Russian and freely travelling around the country'.

His public appearance came as he sought further asylum in Russia after his previous stint ended on August 1.

Kucherena said: 'The decision on the application has been taken and therefore, with effect from August 1, 2014, Edward Snowden has received a three-year residential permit.

'In the future, Edward himself will take a decision on whether to stay on and get Russian citizenship or leave for the United States.'

He said Snowden could apply for citizenship in 2018 after living in Russia for five years, but that he had not decided whether he wanted to stay or leave.

Kucherena said Snowden was studying Russian and had an IT-related job, but did not provide further details.

'He is a high-class IT specialist.'

He said Snowden's security was being taken seriously and that he was using private security guards.

The tone of statements out of the United States, including out of the State Department, suggested his security was at risk, even in Russia, Kucherena said.

Kucherena has in the past expressed concerns that Snowden could be in danger because of his intelligence background and the fact the United States wants him to stand trial.

'I should say that he can move freely, he can go to the shops, visit museums and theatres,' he said. '[But] he needs to think about his safety.'

Snowden's place of residence has not been disclosed and few pictures of him have appeared in the media.

However, voices in the West have suggested he is strongly under the control of the Russian secret services, an allegation denied in Moscow.

Snowden is wanted by US prosecutors for leaking details about the National Security Agency's snooping operations.

The 
spokesman for the White House National Security Council, Ned Price, said
 Snowden needed to return to the United States to face charges related 
to the leaks.

'Mr.
 Snowden faces felony charges here in the United States. He should 
return to the U.S. as soon as possible, where he will be accorded full 
due process and protections,' Price said.

Amnesty International has called on other states to offer him asylum. Currently he cannot travel because his US passport was annulled.

'Edward Snowden is cornered in a legal limbo, without a passport or asylum protection from any government,' said Sherif Elsayed-Ali, deputy director of global thematic issues at Amnesty International.
