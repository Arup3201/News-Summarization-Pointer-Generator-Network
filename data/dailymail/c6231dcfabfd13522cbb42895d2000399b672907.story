First there was a website that predicted when your parents would die; now there's a watch that not only predicts when you will die, it also begins counting down.   

Users fill out a questionnaire about their medical history before subtracting their age from the overall results to get their death score. This score is entered into the Tikker and the countdown begins.

Dubbed the 'death watch', Tikker has been created by Swedish inventor Fredrik Colting but far from being morbid, Colting calls it 'The Happiness Watch' and claims it has been designed to help people make the most of their life and cherish the time they have left.

To set up Tikker, the wearer fills 
out a questionnaire by entering information about their medical history,
 including allergies or illnesses.

They are also asked whether they 
drink or smoke and if there are any instances of cancer, diabetes and 
other diseases in their family.

Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score.

Their age is deducted from the results to predict a death date and the Tikker begins the countdown. 

'Imagine someone told you that you only had one year left to live. How would that change your life? For all of us life comes with a best-before date,' said Colting.

'While death is non-negotiable, life isn’t. All we have to do is learn how to cherish the time and the life that we have been given; seize the day and follow our hearts.'

Colting came up with the idea when his grandfather passed away.

Wearers are additionally asked about how much exercise they do, as well as how much they weigh before receiving a score.

Their age is then deducted from the results to predict a death date, and the Tikker begins the countdown.

The Tikker watch, pictured, comes in black and white and costs $59 (£36). It is due to be shipped by April 2014 and Colting is hoping to raise $25,000 (£15,500) to fund the project on Kickstarter

The top row of the watch's digital display shows years, months and days, while the second row counts down hours, minutes and seconds. The bottom row shows the local time.

'From years to seconds it presents time ever moving, never standing still, and our lives dwindlingtowards the final rest,' said Cotling.

'The occurrence of death is no surprise to anyone, but in our modern society we rarely talk about it. I think that if we were more aware of our own expiration I’m sure we’d make better choices while we are alive.'

The design team has set up a Tikker Kickstarter hoping to raise $25,000 (£15,500). The watch costs $59 (£36) and is due to be shipped by April 2014.
