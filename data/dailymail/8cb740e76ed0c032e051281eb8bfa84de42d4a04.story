The pilot who landed a passenger plane without wheels after a technical failure has spoken of his 'huge relief' at bringing the aircraft down without injury or loss of life to his 231 passengers.

There has been an international outpouring of praise for Captain Tadeusz Wrona, 54, since the incredible footage of his soft landing at Warsaw airport emerged.

Capt. Wrona, a father-of-two, gently placed the LOT airlines plane from Newark, New Jersey, on its belly after a technical error disabled the landing gear.

In uniform: Wrona has been hailed as a national hero in Poland and has been promised a state honour by the president. Right, Wrona pictured with a glider - some observers say it was his skills landing the delicate gliders that helped him to such a smooth end with the LOT flight

But at a press conference in Warsaw the pilot played down his role.

'We tried to put the plane down as gently as we could and we were successful,' said Wrona, wearing a dark blue pilot's uniform with golden insignia.

'When I stopped on the runway, I still was not sure that everyone was safe because smoke and some burning from friction appeared on the ground.

'I felt huge relief when the head flight attendant reported that the plane was empty.'

Wrona appeared slightly uncomfortable with the accolades heaped upon him and said it was an 'exaggeration' to call him a hero.

He even said he keeps playing the landing over and over again in his mind, wondering if he might have executed it better.

Relief: Passengers from the Boeing 767 were confronted with a media scrum as they disembarked the plane following an horrendous ordeal

Upset: Some traumatised passengers did not want to speak to reporters as they tried to leave the airport but, right, others relived their ordeal for the news crews

'I am absolutely sure that each of us
 (pilots) would have done it the same way, and that the result would 
have been the same,' said Wrona, one of LOT's most experienced pilots 
who had been flying Boeings for 20 years.

'I've flown this plane maybe five hundred times and the landing gear always worked. This time it didn't.

'The awareness that we'll be forced 
to make an emergency landing only dawned on me three or four minutes 
before we touched down. Earlier we were trying to open the landing gear 
again and again.

'I was just thinking we must not allow ourselves to make a mistake and not to make contact with the ground too hard.

But while Wrona has played down his role, others have been happy to hail him as a hero. 

Polish President Bronislaw Kwasniewski has said he will bestow a state decoration on Wrona for his feat.

In the U.S, video of Wrona's landing 
immediately evoked memories of the 'miracle on the Hudson,' when Captain
 Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger landed a crippled U.S. Airways jet in New 
York's Hudson River in 2009 and saved 155 lives.

Sullenberger is among those who has 
praised Wrona, telling the NY Daily News that Wrona's accomplishment 
'required great piloting skills'.
  Several Facebook pages sprang up to express admiration, with some calling him Wrona a 'superhero.'

One Facebook page carried the motto 
'Fly like an eagle and land like a crow', playing on the fact that the 
word 'wrona' is Polish for crow.

As passengers thanked Wrona for his 
calm under pressure through the media, more snippets are emerging from 
people inside the plane, revealing the sense of foreboding that 
pervaded.    

'I started to cry, and the men around me were also crying,' said one passenger, Krystyna Dabrowska, 62.

'I thought that was the end of me.'

However, the testimony of others 
reveals that Wrona's landing was so smooth some pasengers did not even 
realise there was a problem with the landing gear. 

One man told CNN: 'The pilot landed 
perfectly. We were sure we landed on wheels. We were clapping our hands 
but it turned out there were no wheels.'

A female passenger told the same 
channel: 'We all thought we had landed with no problem. But I was 
sitting near the wings and I saw the parks and smoke.'

Wrona himself joked that he heard one passenger in the back complain about feeling a bump on landing.

Miraculous: Passengers escaped down the plane's emergency chutes after the landing at Warsaw. No one was injured

Some have attributed Wrona's skill in landing the plane so gently to his his years of experience as a glider pilot.

Andrzej Majchrzak, head of Wrona's 
glider club in the southwestern city of Leszno, said that glider pilots 
are specially trained to make delicate landings.

He said: 'The pilot's skills are of 
enormous importance... It takes a very delicate approach to make a 
careful touchdown and avoid damaging the glider, which is a very 
delicate machine.

Majchrzak descibed Wrona, a club 
member since 2001, as a 'responsible pilot, not one who would take risks
 that could end in tragedy.'
  Wrona discovered there was a problem about half an hour after leaving Newark, revealed LOT president Marcin Pirog.

As Captain Tadeusz Wrona approached the runway in the full knowledge that his aircraft had no usable landing gear his dialogue with the air traffic control tower betrayed no hint of worry, as a recording released to the media has shown.

Tower: 'Flight 16 you have permission to land. Wind calm, four knots.'

Wrona: 'We have permission to land. Thank you.'

Tower: 'Flight 16, report landing strip in sight.'

Wrona: 'Strip in sight.'

Tower: 'Good luck.'

The pilot only told passengers four 
hours into the flight - at 1:40 pm Polish time - that the plane faced 
technical problems. An hour later he alerted the crew and passengers 
they were about to land.

Two F-16s dispatched by the Polish Air Force quickly confirmed the landing gear was not coming down.

Seeing no other alternative, Wrona 
circled the airport for an hour and dumped whatever fuel was left in the
 tanks in preparation for the emergency landing.

One passenger said that exiting the plane amid such commotion was more frightening than the ordeal inside the cabin.

'Looking back at the plane smoking 
and 50 fire trucks surrounding it spraying foam puts it in perspective 
how close a call it really was,' Greg Cohen, 42, a boxing promoter from 
Manhattan told the NY Daily News.

The State Commission for Examining Air Accidents has opened an investigation into the reason for of the malfunction.

Polish national carrier LOT said the 
plane suffered 'a central hydraulic system failure,' indicating that the
 hydraulics used to extend the landing gear, or undercarriage, failed.

The failure of an entire 
undercarriage was unprecedented for a Boeing 767 and highly unusual 
overall, according to aviation data and experts.

Wrona himself said he had no fears about flying the very same plane again.

'I will pilot it again with pleasure because it is one of the newest planes in the LOT fleet,' Wrona said.

'I hope it can be repaired. These are very well-made planes.'

The stranded plane is currently lying
 on the junction between two runways and Boeing specialists from the U.S
 have flown out to advise on how best to move the stricken plane. 

The airport has been closed since the drama took place and postponed flights are backing up.

'Maybe it would have been better for 
the company if the slide on the belly ended 300 meters further down the 
runway,' Wrona joked.

'But Boeing manuals don't say how far the plane can slide on its belly.'
