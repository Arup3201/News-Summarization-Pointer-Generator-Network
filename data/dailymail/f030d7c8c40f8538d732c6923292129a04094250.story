Gamers will be able to play popular Xbox and Microsoft PC games on their iPhone and Android handsets later this year, including Age Of Empires

Keen gamers will be able to play popular Xbox and Microsoft PC games on their iPhone and Android handsets later this year.

The U.S. software giant's mobile gaming move is due to a new tie-up and licensing deal with Japanese smartphone game developer Klab Inc.

Microsoft's Age Of Empires, a game popular with Xbox console users and PC gamers, will be available as a free-to-play game worldwide on smartphones by the end of the fiscal year and other titles will follow, according to Japanese news site The Nikkei.

Experts believe that Microsoft's mobile move could mark a turning point in the video game industry, which has primarily been focused on consoles.Â 

While there is clearly plenty of demand for new console offerings, with the forthcoming PlayStation 4 and Xbox One both attracting a lot of attention, many people believe the video game industry is under threat from more people embracing smartphone games and the launch of low-cost services that use cloud computing.

The global smartphone game market is predicted to double from last year's levels to be worth 1.6 trillion yen in 2017, while sales of Sony and Nintendo's consoles have slumped 20 per cent on 2012 figures, according to Marketwatch.

Microsoft's mobile gaming strategy could provide a lucrative link 
between its game console and mobile business, which includes its Windows
 Phone platform.

Windows Phone handsets currently account for just 3 per cent of the world's mobile phones, so providing its games to Android and iPhone handsets, which jointly 
command an estimated 90 per cent of handsets used worldwide, could unlock a huge 
new mobile gaming market for Microsoft.

The Xbox One console will go on sale in November and will cost $499, while the Xbox 360 console will get a new, slimline look.

It will also include a redesigned ultra-sensitive Kinect sensor so users can play games using hand gestures and body movements, improved voice recognition and redesigned Xbox controller.

Hundreds of new games will also be released on the Xbox 360 console, which was originally released eight years ago as the high-definition successor of the Xbox. The gaming console has outsold rivals from Nintendo and Sony for the past two years.

Microsoft's Xbox One console will launch in November and will include built-in Skype features and multitasking Snap Mode
