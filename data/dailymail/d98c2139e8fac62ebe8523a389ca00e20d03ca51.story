This is the dramatic moment a motorist with a concealed carry permit got out of his car and aimed his gun at a man who was punching a woman.

The unidentified man, hailed by witnesses as a hero, was driving along a road in the city of Southlake near Dallas, Texas, when he saw suspect MacMichael Nwaiwu, 28, attacking the female passenger on Friday.

He then pulled over, stepped out of the driver's side door and held up his weapon to the red car on the other side of the road.

The unidentified man, hailed by witnesses as a hero, was driving along a road in the city of Southlake near Dallas, Texas, when he saw  a driver attacking the female passenger

Video footage captured by witness Lindsey Bryant on her cell phone shows Nwaiwu stepping out of the vehicle and holding his hands up.

She was sitting on a nearby intersection when she started filming and asked her sister Mistina Donald to call 911.

Moments later, patrol cars arrived at the scene and pointed their guns at the unnamed man, but they then took Nwaiwu into custody. 

Donald told CBS DFW: 'It was intense not knowing whether bullets were going to start flying from either side of the street.

'It’s amazing that in this day in age that people are willing to reach out and help.'

Police arrived moments later and ordered the motorists to surrender, however they later arrested the suspect in the red car

Bryant added: 'I hope more people see this and are willing to go the extra mile for someone who like this woman, didn’t have a voice and couldn’t speak up for herself.' 

Southlake Police Chief Steven Mylett said in a statement: While we commend this citizen's willingness to get involved in order to protect a victim of crime, the Southlake Police Department does not encourage the public to expose themselves in such a manner.'

MacMichael Nwaiwu, 28 has identified as the man in the red car and is in Keller Jail facing charges of assault 

He insisted that instead witnesses call 911. 

Nwaiwu was booked into the Keller Jell following his arrest for arrest.

In a post on the Southlake Department of Public Safety's Facebook page, Mylett added: 'Preliminary investigation revealed the individual with the firearm had observed an assault in progress inside a vehicle; specifically, a man physically assaulting his female front seat passenger. 

'The witness, a concealed handgun license holder, believed the female passenger to be in imminent danger of a felony offense. When both vehicles stopped, the witness exited his vehicle and confronted the suspect of the assault at gunpoint. 

'Vehicular traffic stopped in both directions on FM 1709 until police arrived. 

'The suspect of the assault, identified as MacMichael Nwaiwu was arrested at the scene and transported to the Keller jail.

'Due to the unusual circumstances in this case, the Southlake Police Department consulted with the Tarrant County District Attorney's Office to determine if the witness had committed any violations of law.

'Based on the available information at the scene, the District Attorney's Office did not believe the witness violated any State law. The Southlake Police Department continues to investigate this incident and will work closely with the District Attorney's Office until this investigation is closed.'
