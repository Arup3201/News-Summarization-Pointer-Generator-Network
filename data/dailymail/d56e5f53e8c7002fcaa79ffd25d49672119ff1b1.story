Interpol has issued an international arrest warrant for ‘White Widow’ Samantha Lewthwaite, a prime  suspect in the Kenyan shopping mall massacre.

The high-priority ‘Red Notice’ for the arrest of the 29-year-old widow of 7/7 suicide bomber Jermaine Lindsay was made at the request of the Kenyan authorities.

The warrant, which included four pictures of British Muslim convert Lewthwaite, relates to charges of being in possession of explosives and conspiracy to commit terrorist crimes in Mombasa, dating back to December 2011.

It does not mention the weekend attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, which was carried out by the Somali-based Al Shabaab group linked to Lewthwaite, and is feared to have killed 130 people.

But the timing of the warrant at the height of investigations into the slaughter of shoppers is seen as hugely significant, suggesting the  Kenyan authorities and other international agencies believe she is alive and was not killed during the four-day siege that left five terrorists dead.

Several witnesses, including soldiers and some of the wounded, have spoken of a white woman being among the Al Shabaab gunmen.

Two claimed she was giving orders to those doing the killing, prompting the belief Lewthwaite was involved directly or as one of the masterminds.

Western security officials in Nairobi say there is growing evidence that several of the terrorists escaped in the chaos following the first shootings on  Saturday, raising the possibility that Lewthwaite was among them.

Interpol secretary general Ronald Noble said: ‘By requesting a Red Notice, Kenya has activated a global “tripwire” for this fugitive.

‘Through
 the Interpol Red Notice, Kenyan authorities have ensured that all 190 
member countries are aware of the danger posed by this woman, not just 
across the region but also worldwide.’

A
 Twitter account claiming to be run by Al Shabaab claimed yesterday: ‘We
 now have permission to disclose the involvement of Samantha Lewthwaite,
 Sherafiyah.

She successfully overseered [sic] the mission.’ The alleged
 bomb plot in Mombasa which prompted the Red Notice relates to plans to 
carry out a series of attacks against Western targets, including hotels 
and British tourists.

Lewthwaite’s
 accomplice is alleged to have been Jermaine Grant, 29, from Newham, 
East London, who is standing trial in Mombasa accused of planning to 
cause the loss of life and possessing bomb-making materials.

Scotland
 Yard officers are giving  evidence at the case, chronicling what is 
said to be the involvement of the widow of the man who blew himself up 
on the Piccadilly Line Tube in 2005, killing 26 people.

A
 previous Interpol warrant had been issued in the name of Essex nurse 
Natalie Faye Webb, whose identity Lewthwaite, a mother of four from 
Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, is now known to have stolen and used after 
leaving Britain in 2009 and going to South Africa.

Grant
 and Lewthwaite have also been named as prime suspects in a grenade 
attack at Mombasa’s Jericho Beer Garden, which killed three, including a
 young boy, and injured 25.

Shortly
 before the attack, a white woman fitting Lewthwaite’s description was 
seen acting suspiciously and asking questions about the bar. She was 
with two Asian-looking men.

Police
 said yesterday they had broadened the investigation into those behind 
the mall attack and were tracking four suspects in the Mombasa area.

They
 revealed that Al Qaeda-linked Al Shabaab militants killed in a gun 
battle last month in the city has been planning similar attacks to 
Westgate.

Reports in Kenya and around the world have repeatedly linked Lewthwaite to the mall carnage.

Bernard
 Wambua, who works with Radio Africa, was overseeing a cookery 
competition for children in the parking lot at Westgate Mall when the 
Islamists began shooting.

He
 said a ‘light-skinned woman’ was directing the men to gun down any 
child who screamed while she personally fired at a gas cylinder and 
microwaves, setting the area surrounding the children on fire.

He
 said: ‘At first we thought it was a robbery but the shots became louder
 as though whoever was shooting was headed in our direction. Two men 
came to the parking lot. They were in jeans and T-shirts, one with an 
Arabic headscarf wrapped around his head. In their hands were huge guns 
and I could see pistols sticking out of their pockets. They started 
shooting at everyone and everything.

‘That’s
 when the light-skinned woman joined them. She, too, had a gun. She 
would point at things and the men shot at them. She shot at a gas 
cylinder we were using for the competition which resulted in a small 
fire. Luckily, it did not spread. She blasted several microwaves, too.’

Mr
 Wambua said the woman targeted children who wept. ‘Anyone who screamed 
was fired at. They were unforgiving.’ Poorvi Jain, 12, watched in terror
 as her nine-year-old brother was killed. Their mother Mukta was shot in
 the elbow while trying to save him. But the extremists then shot again,
 killing the boy.

Her 
headteacher Geetika Saxena said: ‘Poorvi described the men and says she 
saw a white lady. She said she saw her there with two other men.’

Another witness said of the female terrorist: ‘As soon as she issued orders, the men would go on a killing rampage.’

Last
 night, Channel 4 News said its sources had revealed the leader of the 
attacks was a Kenyan Muslim convert named only as Omar.

The
 man had previously been a member of Kenyan special forces and a 
Christian but later converted and left his country in 2005 to join a  
militant group in Somalia, which then merged with Al Shabaab.
