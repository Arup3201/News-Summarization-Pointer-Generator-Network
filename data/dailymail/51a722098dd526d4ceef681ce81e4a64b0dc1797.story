NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has 'tasted' Martian dirt for the first time, testing equipment needed to assess if the planet most like Earth in the solar system has the ingredients for microbial life.

Engineers used a robotic scoop to take a small amount of Martian soil and place into into an instrument inside the rover - although admitted that a find of brightly coloured 'shards' in the soil; caused them to stop for a while.

Initially, the team believed the bright flecks were shed by the rover, similar to bits of plastic debris discovered last week.

Curiosity on the red planet with the scoops of ground it has taken clearly visible. The soil was placed in the analysis instruments at the bottom of the picture.

The rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains.

It will identify minerals using X-ray diffraction - the first time the techniques has been used.

CheMin will direct a beam of X-rays as fine as a human hair through the powdered material.

When the X-ray beam interacts with the rock or soil sample, some of the X-rays will be absorbed by atoms in the sample and re-emitted or fluoresced at energies that are characteristic of the particular atoms present, allowing Nasa to identify minerals in the sample.

'The science team started to classify these sort of differently, calling them 'schmutz,'' Curiosity lead scientist John Grotzinger, with the California Institute of Technology, told reporters in a conference call.

'We had a lot of fun with that, labeling them and comparing, but in the end it turns out we really feel this is a different sort of particle,' he said.

While not completely ruling out the chance that the flecks are rover debris, most of the team now believes they are naturally occurring, perhaps a mineral that was fractured by the rover scoop.

To be on the safe side, scientists commanded Curiosity to dump that sample and collect sand from another site for processing in the onboard laboratory.

The aim is to get an ingredient list of minerals in the Martian soil.

The rover's Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument is analyzing this sample to determine what minerals it contains.

The rover's robotic arm delivered the sample to CheMin's opened inlet funnel on the rover's deck.

'We are crossing a significant threshold for this mission by using 
CheMin on its first sample,' said Curiosity's project scientist, John 
Grotzinger of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.

'This instrument gives us a more definitive mineral-identifying method than ever before used on Mars: X-ray diffraction.

'Confidently identifying minerals is important because minerals record the environmental conditions under which they form.'

The robotic arm on NASA's Mars rover Curiosity delivered a sample of Martian soil to the rover's observation tray for the first time.

The Mars Science Laboratory rover took the sample after arriving at Glenelg Intrigue, an area where three different types of terrain meet, said Grotzinger.

The information scientists glean about the rocks here will help them decide where to finally break out Curiosityâ€™s drill, he explained.

'We consider ourselves now to be in sort of the promised land,' Grotzinger added.

'We got to believing there were things around us and began to look at everything through that lens,' said mission manager Richard Cook, with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

'We definitely are more aware of what's out there now and are more careful about everything we look at,' Cook said.

The previous day, the rover shook the scooped material inside sample-processing chambers to scrub internal surfaces of any residue carried from Earth.

One earlier scoopful was also used for cleaning.

Additional repetitions of this cleaning method will be used before delivery of a future sample to the rover's other internal analytic instrument, the Sample Analysis at Mars investigation, which studies samples' chemistry.

In August, Curiosity landed inside a 96-mile-wide (154-km-wide) impact crater near the Martian equator on a $2.5 billion, two-year mission to determine if Mars had the chemistry to support and preserve microbial life.

The mission is NASA's first astrobiology initiative since the 1970s-era Viking probes.
