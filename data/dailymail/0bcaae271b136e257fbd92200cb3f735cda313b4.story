North Melbourne coach Brad Scott has looked to draw a line under Brian Lake and Drew Petrie's infamous scrap in last Friday night's AFL game.

Lake was suspended for four games on Tuesday after having his misconduct charge sent directly to the tribunal.

The panel was unswayed by Lake's evidence that he was not trying to grab Petrie's throat, but rather his jumper around the collarbone area.

Scott was unwilling to offer his opinion about Lake's ban or actions - a self-admittedly reserved approach for a coach that is known for being anything but.

'That's a question for Drew. Drew hasn't told me and it's irrelevant to me,' Scott said on Wednesday when asked if Lake had apologised to Petrie.

'It's not really for me to comment. There's going to be plenty of opinion about that (Lake's ban).

'Our concern is for our player and that's it. The footy world can debate the Lake and Hawthorn side of it. Once Drew left the tribunal I turned it off.'

After the rearing, Lake expressed remorse reported The Age. 'It’s been a tough couple of days for myself and my family. It's great to come here and get my point across on what happened,' he said.

'I respect the jury’s decision on the four weeks. Now, I've just got to look forward to a tough four-week period of training to get my body right. Leading into the finals I've got three game to get my match fitness and look for a big September.'

Prior to Lake's case, Petrie fronted the tribunal for making unreasonable and unnecessary contact to the face of the 2013 Norm Smith medallist.

The forward escaped with a reprimand for lashing out at Lake, but was not stung with any carryover points as the match review panel had intended.

Petire explained to the tribunal that Lake's right arm had trapped him in a headlock, when he reached up with his hand to push himself out of that position for his own safety, The Age reported.

Unable to see, he said he pushed Lake for only two seconds and stopped immediately when he realised he had come into contact with Lake's face.

Petrie said Lake was in a 'dominant' and 'aggressive' position on his head as they wrestled. 'I knew I had to push out of that position to prevent any damage to myself,' Petrie told the tribunal.

'We wanted to defend Drew at the tribunal and make sure that he went into the back half of the year without anything hanging over his head,' Scott said.

The Kangaroos face St Kilda in Hobart on Saturday, while Lake will miss games against Adelaide, Sydney, Western Bulldogs and Melbourne.
