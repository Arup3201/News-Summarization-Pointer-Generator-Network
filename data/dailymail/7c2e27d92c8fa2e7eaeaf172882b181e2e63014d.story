A woman who suffered five miscarriages in as many years has finally had her dream of a perfect family come true, after taking a daily aspirin.

Nurse Dawn Paddock longed for a second child to complete her family but suffered a tragic series of miscarriages.

Doctors initially carried out a series of tests on the 33-year-old but were unable to find why she could not reach full term, before she took a colleague's advice about taking aspirin and gave birth to her first child, son Shay two years ago.

She then went through a further three miscarriages trying for a second child, before she remembered the daily tablet she had taken during her first pregnancy.

And to her surprise, doctors told her she had stumbled across the answer to her problems, as they diagnosed her with a blood clotting condition called antiphospholipid syndrome.

The breakthrough meant Mrs Paddock and husband Christian, 34, were finally able to make it to full term with a second child, Isobel, thanks to the over-the-counter painkiller.

The happy mother-of-two, who now works as a school nurse, said: 'I just kept thinking why - I am not a smoker and I did not drink so I could not understand why I kept having miscarriages.

'I could not face working on the maternity ward again after going through so many miscarriages.

'I had to take a big drop in pay and hours to move job, but I just could not face the heartbreak

'The only way Christian and I could deal with the pain of a miscarriage was to try and get pregnant again.

'We never wanted Shay to be an only child.'

Doctors warn against self-diagnosing and taking aspirin during pregnancy.

Mrs Paddock has now called for all women with a history of miscarraige to have tests for antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as Hughes syndrome or sticky blood.

Following her fifth miscarriage Mrs Paddock underwent several tests as doctors desperately tried to find out what was causing her to miscarry.

She was sent to Liverpool Women's Hospital where she was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome - a blood clotting disorder which can result in miscarriage or stillbirth.

Four days after her diagnosis Dawn found out she was pregnant again.

Doctors put her on blood thinning drug Heparin and she also took an aspirin every day as she had also done with Shay.

In June this year Isobel was born five weeks prematurely, but healthily.

She fears thousands of other women could be suffering the same pain as her when they already have the cure sat in their bathroom cupboard.

She said: 'I told all the doctors I was taking the aspirin and they said it would not do any harm.

'I was going to stop taking it after the 12 week scan, but I was too scared to stop.

'Later the doctor said that Shay's birth was down to the aspirin.

'We were quite tearful when we got the test results back because the doctor said if I had stopped taking the aspirin I would never have given birth to Shay and because it was such a relief to find out we had been doing the right things.

'Just before I fell pregnant with Isobel it was getting to the point where we would have had to give up hope, because it was all getting too painful.

'I worked with people who had miscarriages and I had never heard of antiphospholipid syndrome, which shows how rare it is.

'People need to be more aware of this condition. A £35 blood test could end the agony of unexplained recurrent miscarriage.

'When I am out with the double pushchair people always say "you are lucky to have one of each", but I think if only they knew what we had been through to get them.'

It is unnecessary to take aspirin in a normal pregnancy, says consultant gynaecologist Clive Spence-Jones, of London's Whittington Hospital. In fact, it's important not to self-medicate at all, and see your GP if you have any health concerns.

The reason why aspirin is recommended for women such as Dawn is because she has a disease that can cause abnormal blood clotting. These clots can stop the blood flow between mother and baby through the placenta.  

Aspirin is known for its anti-clotting properties – it basically thins the blood – and so in women with this condition, it can help prevent  the clots that cause a miscarriage from forming.

It may also aid blood flow to the placenta.

Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as sticky blood or Hughes syndrome, accounts for as many as one in five cases of recurrent miscarriage.

Women who have suffered three or more unexplained miscarriages should ask their GP to have a test for Hughes syndrome.

Treatment is simple and aimed at preventing the formation of clots. Those who test positive are usually given a daily low dose of 75mg aspirin (which is about one quarter of an adult aspirin tablet) combined with another prescription blood thinner, heparin.

The combination can reduce the risk of miscarriage in women with Hughes Syndrome by around 50 per cent.

Antiphospholipid syndrome can also cause deep vein thrombosis, stroke or a heart attack.

THE MEDICINE CABINET STAPLE THAT'S PROVING TO BE A REMARKABLE DRUG

Humble aspirin, the staple of every medicine cabinet, is proving to be a remarkable drug.

Originally derived from willow bark, but now synthetically made, it’s been used as a painkiller for years.

It’s also widely taken by people with cardiovascular disease or at risk 
of stroke due to its ability to cut the risk of blood clots.

Most recently, research published last week in The Lancet found taking a
daily low-dose aspirin for five years cut cancer death risk by 37 per 
cent.

The drug appeared to stop the disease spreading and to ward off certain types of cancer, such as colon and breast.
