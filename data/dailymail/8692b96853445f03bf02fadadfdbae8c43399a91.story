Luis Suarez finally broke his La Liga duck as Barcelona routed Cordoba, closing the gap on leaders Real Madrid to just one point.

Although the Uruguayan was delighted to end his eight-game goalless streak in the competition, it was strike partner Pedro that took the plaudits, bagging the first and then playing in Suarez for his goal.

Lionel Messi was having a quiet game but had the final say with two late goals to add gloss to the scoreline, after Gerard Pique had nodded in the third, providing a sweet end to what had been a bitterly disappointing year for his club.

Barcelona have been battered to the canvas in 2014, at least to the extent that a side as big as Barcelona can be.

They lost in the Copa del Rey final to Real Madrid, they threw away La Liga on the final day against Atletico Madrid at the Nou Camp, and were booted out of the Champions League by Diego Simeone's side as well.

Then there were off-field problems, with Neymar's contract controversy forcing the resignation of Sandro Rosell and the tragic death of former coach Tito Vilanova.

The start to life under Luis Enrique has been rocky, with a good start crumbling away after defeats in the Clasico and then at home against Celta Vigo.

But slowly they are picking themselves up and dusting themselves down. This was the fourth home game in two weeks, and they have scored a total of 21 goals in that time.

In between, there was last weekend’s weak performance away at Getafe, when without Neymar they lacked the skill and incision to destabilise the Madrid minnows and suffered a goalless draw.

The Brazilian had an ankle injury, which saw him left on the bench for this game, but he was not needed.

Pedro, who now has six goals in six games after netting only one in the previous 16 games, opened the scoring after just a minute.

Ivan Rakitic played a crafty through ball towards the six-yard box and Pedro took one touch to control it and another to ram it into the top right corner, with Juan Carlos helpless.

The forward, always patient despite his reserve status at the club, turned provider for the second goal.

Andres Iniesta played the ball into the area and Pedro took control, weighed up his options and rolled the ball back for Suarez in the middle.

Since signing from Liverpool, he has fluffed his lines a few times in La Liga. He had a chance after 10 minutes when Jordi Alba charged up the left and cut it back, but Suarez volleyed into the side netting.

But receiving Pedro’s pass, he took his 17th shot of the league campaign, in his eighth appearance, and finally got the goal he cherished. From just a couple of yards out he prodded the ball through Juan Carlos’ legs and turned the Nou Camp into a cauldron of camera flashes.

Rakitic, who has been in and out of the team since signing from Sevilla, nearly added a third two minutes later, cracking a fierce drive off the outside of the post.

Cordoba, who only had one win in their previous 15 La Liga games, never looked like getting something here.

The closest they came was a rambling break by Nabil Ghilas, who skinned Javier Mascherano but then fired into the side netting of Claudio Bravo’s goal. While many thought Marc Andre-ter Stegen would be the replacement for Victor Valdes, the Chilean has been faultless in his stead.

There was more to come from Barcelona, even if the game had already been won. Substitute Xavi Hernandez whipped in a free kick which Pique planted into the net with a firm header, before Messi smashed one home himself, despite putting in a subdued performance, overall.

His second goal, right at the death, was even better. Messi pulled off a phenomenal, elastic piece of control to bring a cross in, swivelled and then fired home inside Juan Carlos’ near post.

Barcelona are now breathing down Real Madrid’s neck at La Liga’s summit, although Los Blancos have a game in hand because of their Club World Cup participation.

There is still plenty for Enrique to work on. He selected a 24th different line up in his 24th game in charge, which suggests he has worked out neither his best eleven nor the optimal system.

But Barcelona can head into 2015 with the wind in their sails, given Suarez has finally broken his duck in domestic competition and Pedro looks close to rediscovering his form.
