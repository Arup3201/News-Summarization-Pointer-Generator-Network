Earning welfare: Teens will be told to c ollect rubbish

Jobless youngsters will be forced to pick up litter or carry out other community work if they want to receive benefits, David Cameron will say today.

In a major speech on Tory welfare plans, the Prime Minister will claim it is wrong for them to be allowed to go straight on to the dole.

He will pledge that a future Tory government will introduce mandatory community work for unemployed youngsters in order to instil the ‘discipline of turning up for work each day’.

Mr Cameron said last night that making young people work for their dole would help them ‘make something of their lives’ and ensure they gave something back to their community in return for ‘help’ from the government.

The move is part of Tory plans to ‘abolish’ the scourge of long-term youth unemployment.

Under original plans, claimants would only receive benefits for six months before being required to start an apprenticeship or carry out community work.

But Tory sources said the scheme would now be ‘turbo-charged’ to require young people to carry out community work from the first day of their claim.

Any young person who has not been in education, training or work during the previous six months will be asked to undertake daily volunteer work in order to qualify for their handouts.

The plan will affect around 50,000 young people a year who currently go straight on to the dole. Mr Cameron said the plans were ‘not just about saving money’ but about breaking the cycle of welfare dependency.

‘Our welfare reforms are about changing lives and making this a country that rewards work and gives everyone the chance of a better future,’ he said. ‘We want to get rid of that well-worn path from the school gate, down to the Job Centre, and onto a life on benefits.

‘From day one they must realise that welfare is not a one-way street. Yes, we will help them, but there is no more something for nothing. They must give back to their community too.’

The Tories have already pledged to abolish Jobseekers’ Allowance for those aged 18-21 and replace it with a time-limited Youth Allowance if they win power in May.

The existing Community Work Programme, which can include making meals for older people or working for local charities, typically involves 30 hours a week for three months plus ten hours of job-seeking activity a week. Sources said community work placements have been shown to be more effective in getting claimants off benefits than just signing on.

A pilot scheme in London requiring youngsters to do community work from the first day of their claim has proved even more effective. The plan is expected to cost about £20million a year to deliver.

Sources said this would come from savings produced by the roll-out of the universal credit scheme.
