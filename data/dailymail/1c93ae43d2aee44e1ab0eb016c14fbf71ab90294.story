The parade marks the completion of 44 weeks of training for 200 young people who will be commissioned into the British Army and the armies of 13 overseas countries.

SUO Hunter-Choat, a Bristol University graduate from Hereford, was presented with the award by Defence Secretary Philip Hammond on behalf of the Queen.

The award is given to the military academy's best cadet each year, and SUO Hunter-Choat was selected from 200 senior cadets by the academy's Commandant, Major General Timothy Evans.

The top three top candidates for the award are termed 'blade runners', and their performances are scrutinised before they are brought before the Commandant for final interview.

SUO Hunter-Choat comes from a military family: her father Brigadier Tony Hunter-Choat began his career in the French Foreign Legion before commissioning into the British Army.

As the fourth woman to be honoured with the sword, SUO Hunter-Choat follows Angela Laycock, who attended Sandhurst with Prince William and who joined the Royal Engineers in 2007; Fiona Stewart, who was commissioned into the Royal Signals in 1998; and Kady Leather, commissioned into the Adjutant General's Corps (Educational and Training Services) in 2003.
