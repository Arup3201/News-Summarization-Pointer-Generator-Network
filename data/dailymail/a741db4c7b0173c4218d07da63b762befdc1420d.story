Britain's most expensive one-bedroom flat has gone on the market for £10million.

The luxury flat at One Hyde Park has been dubbed the ultimate 'pied-a-terre' and is so expensive that a simple waste bin takes up £6,300 worth of space.

But there will be no room for guests at the property, which is regarded as the finest one-bedroom home in the world's priciest apartment block.

The lower level of the duplex apartment is the sleeping area and boasts a huge double bedroom with en-suite bathroom. Upstairs is for socialising, with the area dominated by an open-plan living and dining room. There is also a separate toilet.

It may have only one-bedroom, but the £10million apartment for sale at One Hyde Park boasts this huge living room with a large flat-screen TV

The lower level of the flat is a large bedroom, which has a large window looking out on the area around Hyde Park in central London

The one-bedroom apartment, in Knightsbridge, has now been put on the market for £9.9 million - 56 times the average house price in England and Wales.

It works out at £6,300 per square foot and is £4.3 million more than the next most expensive one-bedroom property in the capital.

And while large properties have sold for this £ per sq/ft price before, figures from LonRes, which tracks the property market, has a top one-bedroom price of £5,035 per sq/ft.

The kitchen, which measures a modest 12'11 x 8'10, takes up around £700,000 of space - the same amount as a large family home in most cities.

Whoever buys the flat will have to hand over £1.1 million in stamp duty. They also have to pay £2,000 per year in ground rent along with a £32,000 annual service charge.

One Hyde Park was designed by Richard Rogers at Rogers, Stirk, Harbour and Partners. It opened in 2009 and is made up of 86 apartments with the interior designed by Candy and Candy.

Residents get 24-hour SAS-trained security, an in-house maid service, same day laundry and dry cleaning, room service from the Mandarin hotel and a private temperature controlled wine store.

The  huge price tag of the property - which is down the road from Buckingham Palace - means it works out at £6,300 per square foot

As well as a large bedroom, living room and kitchen, the two-storey exclusive apartment also includes a separate bathroom

The development also has 'unmatched leisure and entertainment facilities' which includes a private spa, 21-metre swimming pool, sauna, steam room, squash court and cinema.

Simon Barnes, an independent property consultant, has been inside One Hyde Park and deals in the super-prime market.

He said: 'It is an amazing place and it is not like buying a one-bedroom flat. It is a very modern, high quality build, you have the Mandarin next door and the ultimate concierge.

'The sort of person who will look at it is likely to be the sort of person who spends a lot of time in a hotel. But for £10 million you could get quite a few nights in the finest hotel suite.

'The bar in residential development keeps being raised. What you lack in London are the locations to build on, which is why they can charge such a price at One Hyde Park.

'Will the quality of developments improve? Yes, but it is highly unlikely you find a better location.'

Residents also get the use of a swimming pool, room service from a neighbouring hotel, sauna, squash court and cinema in the building

The apartment block - which is guarded by an SAS-trained security team - has seen a previous penthouse suite sell for £140million

A number of homes like this are bought by people to show off, according to Henry Pryor, a buying agent.

He said: 'They see these sort of homes as they do an expensive watch or a supercar. For them, the value with the bragging rights to their friends or impressionable girlfriend is often much more than the price.'

The duplex apartment is on the market with Strutt & Parker's Knightsbridge office and also benefits from an underground parking space.

James Gilbert-Green, a partner at the estate agency, said: 'One Hyde Park is commonly regarded as the best new residential building in London, if not the world.'

The most expensive apartment to sell in One Hyde Park was a penthouse, which was bought for £140 million last year.

Plans show the limited size of the apartment - but property experts say the 'bragging rights' of owning a flat in the building will attract the rich

While £10million only buys you a one-bedroom flat in central London's most exclusive apartment block, the same amount can buy you considerably more elsewhere in the world.

A 300-acre estate, which includes three miles of beautiful Caribbean coastline, recently went up for sale on the island of Tobago.

Luxury real estate firm Debutesq Group said the site offers the perfect opportunity for investors because authorities have granted planning permission for a leisure resort on an area known as the L’Anse Fourmi Estate on the island’s northeast coastline.

A 300-acre estate which included three miles of unspoilt Caribbean coastline recently went on the market, also priced at £10million

Meanwhile in the UK, the same amount could buy you 47 houses in Manchester - where the average property price is £211,000.

Four Scottish castles - boasting a combined 40 bedrooms and acres of land including coastline - are on the market each for less than £2million - meaning a buyer could purchase all four and still get change from £10million.

In 2013, an entire Devon village, Bantham, consisting of 25 homes, a pub and a shop was put on the market valued at £10million.

The estate which included the village was later sold for £11million and the owner allowed residents of the village to continue living in their homes.

A nine-bedroom regency house in Worcestershire with 19 acres, was recently valued at just over £9.5million and Conkwell Grang, a ten-bedroom country estate near Bath with 278 acres is worth just over £8million.

For those who don't want to get tied down to a mortgage, £10million could buy 7,279 nights - 20 years - staying in the Piccadilly Suite at London's The Ritz hotel, with breakfast.

The same amount could by you 47 homes - practically a whole street - in Manchester, where the average property is valued at £211,000
