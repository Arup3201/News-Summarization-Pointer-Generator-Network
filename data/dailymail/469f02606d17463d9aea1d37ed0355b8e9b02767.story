Tragic: Kamaljit Sidhu leapt from a motorway bridge after her former partner put her through an ordeal of stalking and harassment, a court heard

The mother of a woman who leapt from a motorway bridge has condemned her daughter's stalking ex-lover for 'putting her through hell'.

Ryan Dey, 23, refused to accept that Kamaljit Sidhu wanted to end their 18-month relationship and made threats towards her and her friends.

He was arrested soon after Miss Sidhu jumped from a bridge over the M6 last autumn, and today he was jailed for two years after admitting stalking the 29-year-old.

Passing sentence, a judge told how Dey had threatened to tell Miss Sidhu's family she had an abortion and that he had once beaten her up.

Miss Sidhu's grieving mother Sarbjit Sidhu said 'evil' Dey put her daughter through an ordeal of 'control and abuse' in the weeks before she fell to her death.

'Does Ryan Dey really realise the damage he has inflicted on my beloved Kam, me and my family?' she asked in a statement released after the hearing today.

'We will never forget our baby Kam, I was unable to see her for the last time when she was put to rest and that has been difficult to deal with.

'Ryan Dey is evil, he is a bully and a coward and had put my daughter through hell with his control and abuse and will never be forgiven for what he has caused.

'As a mother and a family we want the world to know this can never be allowed to happen again, I do not want anyone else to go through what we have. Our lives have stopped and we can't breathe.'

She added: 'The police asked is there anything we can do, Mrs Sidhu, and my only answer to them was can you please give me my daughter back, we really miss her, her death has left a big hole in our lives.'

Miss Sidhu, who was known to loved ones as Kammi, leapt to her death last October from a bridge over the M6 near to Great Barr in the West Midlands, where she lived with her family.

In the weeks leading up to her death, Birmingham Crown Court heard, she had been hounded by Dey, a lorry driver from Oldbury, who had refused to accept that she had put an end to their relationship.

He made threats towards her, contacted her friends and had searched various locations in Birmingham, where she worked, trying to find her.

She went on to make comments on social media telling friends that she was afraid of Dey in the lead up to her death.

Judge Michael Chambers said: 'You had been in a relationship with Kam for the previous 18 months notwithstanding the other relationship you were in.

'You did not like her seeing or socialising with anybody else. You did not even like it when she was seeing friends in her own home.

'She sought to end the relationship but instead of accepting it you started persistently harassing her.

'It led her to becoming very frightened. You even hacked into her Facebook system and sent messages to her friends pretending to be her.

'She was living at home with her parents and you called their land line at all times of night and day. You repeatedly went to the address and waited outside.'

The court heard that on the night before Miss Sidhu's death, she had been out at a bar with friends following a job interview in Birmingham.

But her 'demeanour changed dramatically' when she spotted Dey in the same bar with two men, leading her to drop down on all fours and hide from him.

'She continued the evening with her friends and she ended up on motorway bridge having been drinking,' the judge said. 'A message was written by her on a moisturiser bottle and said: "I loved you all. I just got weak. Sorry."'

Miss Sidhu jumped to her death at 4.30am on October 25, hours after the incident in the bar.

'I'm satisfied that you did or said something to her that made her very frightened,' said Judge Chambers.

'Coupled with the background plus whatever had caused her to be so frightened of her significant factor which caused her to fall off that bridge.

'I'm satisfied she did take her life and you were a factor in that.

'What you did or communicate will never be known but from police interviews we know you threatened you would disclose to her family she had had an abortion and at least on one occasion you had beaten her up.

'She was a much loved and liked young woman with her life before her. Those close to her should understand any sentence does not reflect or measure the loss of a loved one.'

Dey was arrested a month after Miss Sidhu's death and charged with harrassment and stalking.

Prosecutor Peter Grieves-Smith told the court that on the night she spotted him while out drinking in Birmingham she had already told her parents that he had been in touch with her and that if he called the house not to tell him where she was.

Dey began calling the Sidhus repeatedly, leading them to disconnect their phone. 'They did not wish to speak to him,' the prosecutor said.

'But the effects of that meant when the victim tried to call her parents later that night she couldn't get through.'

'Much loved and liked': The court heard that Dey repeatedly hacked into Miss Sidhu's Facebook account, sending abusive messages to her friends

Friends who were out with Miss Sidhu that evening got the impression that she was on edge, said Mr Grieves-Smith.

'The effect of what he did by coming to the bar that night was that she was terrified. The victim continued to hide and eventually she returned looking distressed,' he said.

'That night she left the bar after she was satisfied he was gone and she was given a lift by a friend. It was not long after she was dropped off she fell from the motorway bridge.

'Something had occurred to make her manifestly scared. We might never know what that was.'

The court heard Dey sent a string of threatening messages to Miss Sidhu on Facebook just hours before she died.

Mr Grieves-Smith added: 'It was clear that one of the Facebook entries from the defendant at 1.30am that night said "I'm going to f*** you up".

'He repeatedly hacked into her Facebook account and could see who she was communicating with and what she was doing.

'A Facebook message on October 23 at 6.21am from the victim's account to a friend asked "What do you think about orgies and threesomes".

'The message had been sent from the defendant who had hacked into the account.

'The victim's friend told police the defendant had said "You stupid bitch I will tell your family all of the f***ed up shit you have done."

'He also took her mobile phone and the purpose of doing so was control.

'Bit by bit it as time proceeded it got worse and had led to the moment of the early hours of October 25 when she died.'

Dey was sentenced to two years in prison at Birmingham Crown Court after avoiding a trial by admitting stalking and causing serious alarm or distress at a hearing last month.

Following the sentencing today, detective chief inspector Kim Madill, from West Midlands Police Public Protection Unit, said: 'This has been a difficult, challenging and deeply upsetting case to investigate for all concerned.

'The investigation team has worked tirelessly to try and find some justice for Kamaljit and her family, following her tragic and untimely death.

'One can only imagine the fear and torment that Dey must have put her through to take such a course of action.

'Even though this conviction cannot bring Kamaljit back, hopefully the fact that Dey has admitted his crimes and is now facing a spell in prison will come as some comfort to her grieving family.'
