Willy Wonka lifestyle: Angus Kennedy would munch his way through the equivalent of 20 bars of Dairy Milk, or 25 Creme Eggs, in one working day

Taste tester Angus Kennedy appeared to have the dream job - sampling sweets, chocolate, toffees and other confectionery all day long.

But the much-envied father of five has been forced to leave his role as Britain’s ‘Chief Chocolate Taster’ - after piling on two stone.

The 47-year-old, who worked from a cosy office at his home in Maidstone, Kent, decided it was time for a change after the doctor told him his cholesterol was dangerously high.

Mr Kennedy has now retired from his post as a taste tester - and his job editing Kennedy’s Confection trade magazine - and intends to concentrate on a writing career.

The father of five was eating up to 2lbs of ingenious new treats - including cocoa-covered ants and aphrodisiac lollipops - every day.

The high-calorie diet caused his weight to balloon to 13-and-a-half 
stone and doctors warned he risked a heart attack if he carried on.

Now the former champion rower has embarked on a strict exercise regime and cut all chocolate 
from his diet in a bid to return to his normal weight of 11-and-a-half 
stone.

He said: 'Eating chocolate for a living really was the dream job. I was 
given a Golden Ticket to sample the world’s craziest, tastiest new 
goodies and review them in the magazine.

'The only problem with eating chocolate from 9 to 5, of course, is the predictable weight gain and high cholesterol.

'In the last couple of years, I’ve put on some considerable weight and a
recent check-up showed my arteries were far from fighting fit.

Sweet deal: But the 47-year-old is leaving his job after developing 'dangerously high' cholesterol

'It was with regret that I stepped down from the magazine to concentrate on a less harmful - but certainly less sweet - career.'

Mr Kennedy has been editing the magazine for the last 20 years.

He was dubbed ‘Willy Wonka’ in October 2010 after some of the world’s biggest manufacturers hired him as a chocolate taster.

After landing the taste testing job, he sampled more than 200 new products per month - around 30,000 in total - while  earning £30,000-a-year.

Manufacturers including Mars and Nestle relied on his experience and
sophisticated palate to sample new treats ahead of production.

At a trade show, he would often eat up to 3lbs of goodies - 
approximately 20 bars of Dairy Milk or 25 Creme Eggs - in less than 12 
hours.

His monthly magazine is more than 120 years old and is sent to 5,000 subscribers worldwide.

But following the birth of his fifth child earlier this year, he decided
to have a check-up - and was told to quit the chocolate or face a 
'future of ill-health'.

Mr Kennedy has now employed a new editor and a team of tasters, but added: 'I’ll really miss being Willy Wonka.'
