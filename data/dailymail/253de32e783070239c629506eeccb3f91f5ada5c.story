Sue Rumsey, 45, leapt in her car and chased two men after she saw them burgling her neighbour's house in Laindon, Essex

A woman who chased a burglar in her car, mounting the pavement to prevent him escaping, has been praised for her 'determination' by a judge.

Sue Rumsey, 45, spotted two suspicious-looking men hanging around near her home in Laindon, Essex, and realised they were burgling a neighbour's house.

She called the police but when the men fled from the house, Mrs Rumsey leapt into her car and chased them, before helping officers to arrest one of them while his colleague arrested the other.

After Stephen Sayer, 32, and Michael Perry, 33, appeared in court charged with burglary, judge David Owen-Jones told them: 'If it were not for the determined actions and observations of Sue Rumsey, you would have got away with it.'

Mrs Rumsey flew into action on November 27 last year when she saw the two men in the street near her home.

She said: 'I saw the two lads hanging about and thought "You’re not right for around here".

'It was just instinct so I just kept watching, and then when I saw one of them go around the back, I rang the police.

'They said there was an officer on the way but at that point I saw them making off and I didn’t want them getting away.

'I
 stayed in the car and followed them - I know the area well so I was 
speaking to the police to help them work out where they would try to go.

'I thought I’d lost them, but then I looked up and saw they had had the audacity to go back to the house.'

She added: 'A
 PCSO [special constable] came jogging along but the lookout, who was on a bike, saw him and
 yelled to his friend so I thought "He’s never going to catch him".

'The burglar came over the back fence and I thought "I’m not giving up on this now I’ve come this far".

'I put my foot down and caught up with him before mounting the kerb to cut off his exit.

'I think he thought I was police as he put his hand on the roof as if to give himself up.

'Then the PCSO stepped in and arrested him, and a police unit caught the other boy on a bike.'

Sayer, from Basildon, Essex, was given a
 three-and-a-half year jail sentence for burglary, criminal damage and 
breach of a suspended sentence when he appeared in the dock at Basildon 
Crown Court.

Perry, from Laindon, who acted as his accomplice and lookout, admitted burglary and received a 15-month 
prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.

The court heard that jewellery stolen was later recovered by officers.

Mrs Rumsey said: 'I’m not a hero - I was just at the right place at the right time.

'We’ve all lived round here for a number of years so we all look out for each other.  Burglary can really ruin people’s lives and I wasn’t going to let it happen.'

Her elderly neighbour, whose house was broken into, praised Mrs Rumsey and said he was lucky to live in a street where everybody knew each other.

He said: 'Sue was absolutely amazing.  She could have got herself hurt and was really brave to chase them.

'It’s not nice imagining these men rooting through the house but it gives me some comfort knowing I have neighbours who will look out for us.'
