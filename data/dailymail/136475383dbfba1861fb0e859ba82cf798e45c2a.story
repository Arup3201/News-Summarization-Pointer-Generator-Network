A bitter spat between former Prime Ministers Bob Hawke and Paul Keating over who was most responsible for the success of Labor in the late 1980s, shows no sign of ending.

The latest saga in this simmering feud, which has been running for nearly 30 years, involves Mr Hawke's recent appearance on ABC Television's Australian Story and contributions by cabinet colleagues of the time.

Mr Keating takes aim at Gareth Evans, Ralph Willis and Kim Beazley for their rosy view of Mr Hawke's prime ministership.

It's this way, no it's not. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating were a formidable combination as Prime Minister and Treasurer after Labor was returned to power in 1983. The partnership ended in 1991 when Hawke was toppled by Keating in a party room challenge for the top job

At odds. Bob Hawke and Paul Keating have had very different points of view on just who was most responsible for Labor's significant success while in power during the 1980s

He also dismisses as a 'tawdry hagiography' a book written by Mr Hawke's wife Blanche d'Alpuget in 2010.

'As he often does, he uses relatives, friends and colleagues to do the rebutting for him,' Mr Keating said of Mr Hawke in The Australian.

Mr Keating argues Mr Hawke was a lucky prime minister, as well as a good one.

But he uses published accounts of the time, including by Ms d'Alpuget, to back his argument that Mr Hawke was paralysed by inertia in the years following a traumatic personal issue involving his daughter in 1984.

One of the few occasions in which Keating and Hawke have been pictured together was following a State Funeral for former NSW Premier Neville Wran in Sydney on May 1st this year

Mr Keating says no word would have been uttered by him about those 'vanishing' years, had Mr Hawke not distorted history in his own memoir.

'But Bob, as he often does, overdid it - he baited me one time too often,' he said.

'And no apologia by his mates, no matter how well meant or sentimental, can change the truth that obtained at the core of his government's management.'

Both Keating and Hawke received rousing receptions inside and outside of the Sydney Town Hall at last week's Gough Whitlam Memorial Service but arguably the biggest cheer was reserved for Julia Gillard.
