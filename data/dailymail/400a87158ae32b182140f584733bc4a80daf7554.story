David Cameron has spoken about the pain of seeing Baroness Thatcher ‘slip away’ as she succumbed to dementia.

The Prime Minister said it had been hard for him to see her deteriorate from being at the ‘height of her powers’ to falling victim to the disease.

He revealed that every member of the Cabinet signed up yesterday morning to become ‘dementia friends’ – meaning they will receive training in how to deal with patients with the condition.

Mr Cameron said the poor standards of care for thousands of sufferers – uncovered by the Care Quality Commission earlier this week – was ‘unacceptable’.

And he revealed he was worried he might develop dementia in later life.

Lady Thatcher died last year after long battle against dementia; a fight which was vividly brought to the screen by Meryl Streep in The Iron Lady.

Speaking to BBC Radio Oxford, Mr Cameron said: ‘It was very noticeable and obviously having seen her at the height of her powers when I started working for the Conservative Party back in 1988, you see what an effect this has on someone.

‘I'm actually sitting in Number 10 Downing street in what's called the Thatcher Room, named by Gordon Brown, there's a picture of her staring at me from the wall as we speak which is slightly disconcerting.

‘I've seen that with the parents of friends as well - one minute at the height of their powers, brilliant intellect and brains - then suddenly they start to slip away.’

Mr Cameron said no one in his family had ever had dementia, but he had seen it affect friends.

‘Also as a constituency MP, I've had that heart-breaking wander round care homes where you see people who have often been well-looked after but have slipped away into this silent world,’ he said.

‘It's a heart breaking thing to see.’

Former England cricketer Sir Ian Botham spoke on Monday night of his heartbreak of deciding to end visits to his dementia-suffering father while he was in a care home.

Mr Cameron said: ‘It makes you desperately sad to see what happens to individuals' lives and families' lives. Listening to Ian Botham last night the whole country would have been moved by what he said.

‘But it was also a wake-up call for me when I had it properly explained to me - it's not just a natural part of ageing, it is a disease like cancer, like strokes, like heart disease.’

He said there should be more research into a cure for dementia, as well as better training in hospitals and the training of thousands more ‘dementia friends’ – volunteers who learn how to cope with sufferers.

Mr Cameron said: ‘I've become one myself, I did the training, it's a fascinating thing to do and I'd encourage people to do it.

‘We discussed it at the Cabinet this morning and the whole Cabinet has agreed to become dementia friends. We are going to make sure that happens at a future Cabinet meeting.

‘It’s a fascinating thing to do to put yourselves into the shoes of someone with dementia and work out how best to help them.’

On Monday, the CQC found that almost all dementia sufferers will experience poor care at some point. Nine in 10 care homes and hospitals fail to provide better treatment.

The Prime Minister said the findings were ‘not acceptable’ – and said all care home staff should be dementia friends.

‘One of the things that we did with the CQC is to get it to focus on the real sharp end; to get into the hospitals, get into the care homes, and perhaps spend a little less time worrying about every single dentist chair and GP surgery and get into the care homes where people could be suffering or be mistreated.

‘What they found is unacceptable and the practice needs to change - no doubt about it.’

Mr Cameron told a carer who was looking after a relative with dementia that his experience with his son Ivan, who died five years ago after suffering from cerebral palsy and epilepsy, was that carers needed plenty of rest.

‘As someone who looked after a deeply disabled child, you mustn’t be too tough on yourself. The best thing you can do as a carer is make sure you get the breaks, get the space so you can go on being a good carer when you are caring.

‘We’re not angels, luckily some of us are but most of us aren't - so you need to have the space to go on being a carer.’

The Prime Minister said he worried that he may have to cope with dementia himself.

‘Anyone who has seen someone suffering from dementia, you can't help thinking what if that happens to me, what would it be like, how would I react,’ he said.

‘This national debate that's taking place is a good thing because instead of it being a silent crisis, we are all facing up to it and we're thinking more about what we can do to avoid getting dementia, how we’d cope with a relative with dementia, how we can be better with neighbours with dementia.’
