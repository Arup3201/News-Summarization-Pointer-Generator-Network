Although the FA Cup first round is new territory for Warrington Town, their manager Shaun Reid does have cup experience to draw upon, and not only as the younger brother of former Everton star Peter.

As a Rochdale player, he remembers standing toe to toe in the tunnel with Vinnie Jones for a League Cup tie when Wimbledon's Crazy Gang were in their pomp.

'Vinnie said to me: 'I've done your kid and I'm going to do you'. I knew then it was going to be a battle,' recalls Reid.

'He was taller than me but I used to like them big. We kicked seven bells out of each other, we might as well not have had a ball, and some of the things that were said would get you put in jail today. 

'After the game we had a pint in the lounge at Spotland and he said: 'Oh my God, I thought I was the maddest footballer on the planet'.'

So Reid is not the type to be intimidated by League Two Exeter City in the first live FA Cup tie to be screened by the BBC since 2008.

Having spent his career in Peter's shadow, tonight is Shaun's time in the spotlight.

He is the first Warrington manager in their 65-year history to take them to this stage of the cup. To do it from the Evo-Stik Northern division — the eighth tier of English football — is some achievement, which is why their fans snapped up the 2,500 tickets within hours.

Their Cantilever Park ground, by the Manchester Ship Canal, has never seen anything like it. Average home gates rarely top 250 and the Warrington players earn about £80 a week.

Reid, 49, says: 'I am a hothead, I wear my heart on my sleeve and I probably need to calm down or I'll have a cardiac arrest. Football is about passion. If you can get 18 or 20 people in the dressing room with the same desire, you can achieve.

'My problem is I cannot accept people going onto a football field and not giving everything. You're not always going to have the best match in the world but you can stop your opponent from having the best match.'

Sometimes that passion has spilled over and he has received more than one touchline ban for berating referees. 

But Reid, who played more than 400 games in the Fourth Division, has worked hard to tone down his behaviour and promises he will not be swearing on the touchline as this game will be beamed into family homes all around the country.

'Officials are in the game to improve as well — I try to improve them!' he smiles.

'One thing I won't do is jeopardise my club and its standing in the community. Unless they have an unbelievably good bleep machine, you won't hear me using bad language. The dressing room will be my domain, in there I will be myself.'

'I do overstep the mark at times but I am improving. I take advice from people, I speak to Peter because he's been through most things in football and he knows me inside-out.'

What differentiates Warrington from most non-League underdogs is that there is potential to grow. 'I was brought in by Toby Macormac (Warrington's chairman) to try and achieve Football League status,' said Reid.

'Warrington is supposed to be a rugby league town but I don't believe that because there are more kids playing football than rugby. Fact.

'There are 200,000 people in this town and the Warrington Wolves average gate is about 10,000. So there are 190,000 people out there who might just want to come and watch a football team.'

'This cup game is a start. Words can't describe how special it is for the people who have worked behind the scenes for years.

'We've come so far. I joined in 2012 when we didn't have any players. I used to take a clipboard with the names of 50 players coming in for trials. It started from there.'

Players to look out for include goalkeeper Karl Wills, rated one of the best outside the League, defender Craig Robinson whose brother is MK Dons boss Karl, and former Liverpool trainee David Mannix.

Lewis Field, a fitness instructor nicknamed 'Jesus' by team-mates because of his beard and flowing locks, scored the goal against North Ferriby that got Warrington here.

World Cup winner Roger Hunt, who played for Warrington between 1955 and 1958 when they were known as Stockton Heath Albion, still lives locally and joined the squad for the first-round draw.

For all the success he enjoyed at Liverpool under Bill Shankly, he never forgot his first club.

'I owe Warrington a lot,' says Hunt. 'It was our manager at the time, Freddie Worrall, who persuaded me to join Liverpool rather than Swindon even though they were offering less money. He said I'd be happier staying in the north west. I am glad I took his advice.'

One of Warrington's directors is their local MP David Mowat, who joined other businessmen to save the club from administration in 2008. Mowat said: 'We are closely knitted into the fabric of community life.'

It is hard to think Warrington's big night under the lights would have been possible without Reid, whose obsession with football once saw him walk out on a career's advisor at school who suggested farming.

'Football is my fix, the thing that gets me up in the morning,' he said. 'You can't explain to people who say it's 'just football'. Please don't say that, particularly when you see how special this has been.'
