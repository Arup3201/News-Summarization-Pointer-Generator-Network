Michael died on November 15 when a Union Pacific freight train struck the Veterans Day parade float he was riding on.

He was among 26 people riding on a flatbed truck en route to a support dinner in their honor when the train suddenly appeared on the tracks and ploughed through the float.

According to Michael's mother-in-law, Mary Hefley, the Iraq war veteran pushed his wife of 15 years, Daylyn, off the float just moments before impact, saving her life in the process.

The non-profit group America Supports You Texas will hold a prayer vigil for Michael and the other victims of the Midland parade accident at 2pm on Sunday at Texas Panhandle War Memorial, where Amarillo Mayor Paul Harpole is scheduled to speak.

After the terrorist attacks in New York on September 11, 2001, Michael joined the Army.

He and Daylyn moved to Fort Campbell, where he deployed to Iraq from 2003 to 2004. Michael returned home and was then redeployed to Iraq from 2005 to 2006.

He was awarded two Purple Heart medals before being medically retired due to multiple brain injuries he had suffered after being hit by an IED while serving with the Mighty 101st Airborne Division.

Despite the health problems he suffered as a result of serving his country, Michael said he was proud of being a soldier.

'I wouldn’t change anything that happened. I am a better man, husband and father because of my service,' he wrote in a biographical entry.
