When Google was criticised for not doing enough to block child porn on the internet, it hit back by making great play of its support for online watchdog the Internet Watch Foundation.

Yesterday the extent of that support was revealed – a donation of just £20,000 or equivalent to 90 seconds’ profit for the internet giant.

The Cambridge-based charity, which seeks to police child abuse images online, is so short of funds that its five staff are unable to keep up with the number of websites being reported.

Google has already come under fire for paying just £6million in corporation tax in the UK, despite sales worth £3.2billion in 2011.

Critics say the foundation would be able to take much more effective action against child abuse sites if internet companies gave them more money.

Other web firms are no more generous than Google, according to the charity’s accounts. Facebook donated about £10,000, while Microsoft’s Bing search engine gave about £20,000.

Liz Longhurst, whose daughter Jane was murdered by pornography addict Graham Coutts in 2003, said internet firms must ‘get their act together’ and start tackling violent online imagery.

‘What annoys me immensely is that Google won’t block these sites,’ she said. ‘They say we’ve got to have freedom. All I ask them is where was my daughter’s freedom – tell me that.’

Web companies are under increased scrutiny following the conviction of Mark Bridger, who was jailed for life for the murder of five-year-old April Jones.

He had collected a ‘library’ of sickening images by searching for simple terms on Google and Bing in the weeks before the abduction. 

Both he and Stuart Hazell, who murdered 12-year-old Tia Sharp, had no previous convictions for sexual offences and progressed from viewing child porn on the internet to committing child murder.

Last week Peter Davies, chief executive of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection centre (CEOP), warned it did not have the resources to track down all users of internet child porn.

And on Friday, Vince Cable, the Lib Dem Business Secretary, became the first Cabinet member to call for Google to be ‘more proactive in policing what is there’.

Labour’s media spokesman Helen Goodman said last night: ‘Google’s donation of £20,000 to the IWF cannot hide the fact that they paid only £6million in tax at a time when the police lack the resources to arrest everyone they know is downloading child abuse images.

‘Bringing Bridger to trial cost £9million. What we need is urgent Government action on this.’

Google has used its membership of the foundation to justify taking little action to proactively block child porn on the web.

Last month, when a group of charities demanded urgent action to prevent access to illegal and ‘disgusting’ child pornography via web browsers, a Google statement read: ‘We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation.’

But the revelation that its funding amounts to just £20,000 has infuriated critics.

Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons home affairs committee, called on internet companies to do far more to ensure the foundation is properly resourced.

He said: ‘I am shocked that, despite the importance they have said they place on its role in keeping our children safe, they have donated such paltry amounts to it, which for them represent a drop in the ocean.

‘As it stands, it is difficult to take their commitment to protecting our children seriously.’

The foundation and its five-strong 
team of analysts are being overwhelmed as reports of child abuse sites 
soared by 40 per cent compared with last year, to 40,000 – or 150 a day.

Sir Richard Tilt, chairman of the 
charity’s board of trustees, said: ‘There’s certainly scope for 
increasing our number of analysts and we know if we had more analysts we
 could do better. If we could get more money that would enable us to do 
more.’

John Carr, of the Children’s Charities Coalition on Internet Safety, said: ‘Google’s moral leadership is essential here. They are the biggest player in this space in the world.

‘They can and should be proactive – if they did it, I think others would have to follow.’

Last night Google said the £20,000 was merely a membership fee. The company said it had given the charity’s US counterpart, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, millions of dollars.

Scott Rubin, director of communications and public policy outside the US, said: ‘Google has a zero-tolerance policy on child sexual abuse content. We are members and joint funders of the Internet Watch Foundation – an independent body that searches the web for child abuse imagery and then sends us links, which we remove from our search index.

‘When we discover child abuse imagery or are made aware of it, we respond quickly to remove and report it to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.’

Labour has demanded that ministers force Google to filter out horrific child porn websites from its searches.

The party has unveiled a three-point plan which would make the search engine take tough action to prevent the perpetrators of vile child sex attacks from accessing such sites.

Media spokesman Helen Goodman said that if she were in power she would force Google to put up warning messages before people enter websites containing unlawful child porn images.

She said that if a warning that such sites were illegal flashed up, it would act as a deterrent from looking at them in future.

There is evidence that once people start looking at such images, they then seek out more and more hard-core examples.

Labour would also ensure that no one could see adult sites if they were underage by putting in place the same sort of strict age verification check in place on gambling websites.

As well as protecting children, this will also force people to hand over identifiable details about themselves – such as credit card details – so they can be tracked down by police if need be.

Finally, Miss Goodman said: ‘The industry should be making safe searches the default, instead of expecting people to download the filters themselves.’

The internet industry says there should be few restrictions on porn because it is not illegal.

But Miss Goodman said that in the real world, outside the internet, there is no automatic access to adult material.
