All NSW and South Australian players are receiving counselling and psychological support in the wake of the delivery that left Hughes in a critical condition.

The Australian Cricketers' Association said it was monitoring Abbott, who delivered the ball, closely.

It was reported Abbott was struggling as a host of former Australian pace greats jumped to his support.

'[Abbott] has got a lot of support around him from his teammates and also the counselling services,' ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson said.

'He's someone who we're monitoring closely and we know he's got a lot of support around him.'

Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said Abbott, who cradled the injured batsman after he crashed to the ground, would get whatever help was required. 

'It says a lot about Sean doesn't it?' Sutherland said.

'Sean will have all the support he needs around him.

'I'm sure his teammates and everyone doesn't feel in any way ill of him for what happened. It's a freak, freak incident.'

Former Australian bowler Stuart Clark told Fox Sports he understood Abbott was 'struggling a bit' and said the incident was not his fault.

'He's out there to get Phil Hughes out. It's a competitive sport. It's professional sport and I really feel for Sean Abbott at the moment,' he said.

'I hope he's got support... You just worry that this could jeopardise Sean Abbott and his cricket career and we don't want that.'

There is a long history between Abbott and Hughes who came up through the junior ranks of the NSW cricketing system and are close friends.

The 22-year-old made his first-class debut for New South Wales in 2011, and has since played 15 Sheffield Shield matches for his state, taking 38 wickets at an average of 33.94.

He broke into the Australian side in the shorter form of the game after being the leading wicket-taker during the 2013-14 domestic One-Day Cup.

He made his national debut during Australia's ODI and Twenty20 series with Pakistan in the UAE in October. 

The sporting community, including Marcus North and Brett Lee, have come out in support of Abbott

Former Test bowler Brett Lee said Abbott did not deserve any of the blame for the incident.

'You know you're always on edge bowling fast or being out there batting,' Lee told Channel 9.

'When you see something as shocking as this you really feel for Phil.

'I know first-hand that no one goes out there to try and maim a batsman, no one tries to hurt a batsman.' 

Lee's sentiments were echoed on social media by other sportsmen.

Cricket legend Glenn McGrath tweeted a message of support out to Sean Abbott.

'Our thoughts are also with Sean Abbott,' he tweeted immediately after his message to Hughes.

Another former Australian Test cricketer Marcus North called on Abbott to keep his chin up. 

'Thoughts also go out to a great young kid @seanabbott77 Stay strong mate! #CricketFamily,' he said.

Abbott made his state debut at the age of 18 and won the Steve Waugh Medal as New South Wales player of the season in 2013/14.

Last month he made his one-day international and Twenty20 debuts both against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.

Concerns for Abbott come as streams of Hughes' friends and teammates were seen streaming in and out of St Vincent's Hospital at Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city.

Australian cricket captain Michael Clarke, Shane Watson and Brett Lee visited on Wednesday while Hughes' family remain by his bedside.
