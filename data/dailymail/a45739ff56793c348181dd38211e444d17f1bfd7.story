Is there a secret to buying the perfect engagement ring? Well apparently so, according to one man who has written a how-to buy book for blokes.

Londoner, Alastair Smith who currently lives in Bondi, Sydney, was set to pop the question to his now-wife, Faith, but had trouble finding the information he needed to hunt down the best ring.

'I read a book about diamonds on Amazon by a middle aged lady, but it was all about the technical aspects,' he said.

The ring (pictured) Alastair bought for his wife Faith. His difficult six month search for 'the one' prompted him to write a book, 'How to buy an engagement ring' offering tips for blokes. He bought it online and says it was a cheaper option

The secret to buying the right ring. Alastair Smith was at a loss how to get the right ring, until he began a worldwide research project

'It didn't help me with a budget, whether I should get my other half involved.' 

So, the 31 year old spent the next six months researching and looking for as many sources of information about engagement rings as he could.

Alastair's search began in Sydney, but when he couldn't find what he wanted, he looked elsewhere travelling to other countries on holiday, including New York and London to look into the world of diamonds.

'I still had no luck, they couldn't give me what I was looking for, I needed all the information I could get.'

But after six months, his in depth research paid off and he purchased a ring online, pleased he had got what he wanted and paid less than he would have if he bought it in a retail store.

'I got inside info from two jewellers and one gemologist and in the end got an awesome ring for a great price. I nailed it!' he said.

Alastair proposed to his wife last Easter and said a number of his friends were also getting engaged at the time and it seemed that no one knew what they were doing.

'Some of them spent a fair bit more, got a smaller ring, a lower quality ring.' 

It's then that his ring hunt adventures sparked an brilliant idea to help other blokes who were thinking about proposing to their girlfriends.

The debut author has written a book called 'How to buy an engagement ring' and he says it's an easy to follow guide with hints and tips to help men through the daunting process.

'I wanted to make it easier for other guys going through same thing, millions buy rings every year.' he said.

'Everyone makes the same mistakes, use info to make it easier for people to get a better ring.'

He believes the biggest mistakes men can make is limiting their range of rings on offer, encouraging online purchases.

'There's 500,000 diamonds online instead of 50 in stores,' he said.

He also recommends playing with the types of the ring and its settings.

'There's really big savings to be made if you know what you're doing.'

'Diamonds are rated by the four C's, sometimes guys get too caught up in the clarity, but you can't really see the difference from the naked eye.

'Guys seem to want purer diamonds, but you can't see it,' he said.

The book also provides an insight into understanding what women really want (don't all men), inside info on diamond sourcing and recommended retailers. 

Recent research has found that one in ten women would turn down a proposal if they didn't like the ring, putting more pressure than ever on men to get it right. 

Most men take an average of four months to find the perfect ring, so the book has been released just in time for the busiest proposal season of the year - christmas.

And he has even thought of everything for guys wanting to buy the book, to help raising suspicion, the book comes with fake covers, or undercover covers to keep their pending proposal under wraps.

And if all else fails, and you don't mind breaking the surprise, Alastair says why not ask her what ring she would prefer, because then you know you'll be on the right track. 

'If you were going to ask your wife to pick your fantasy football team, would you trust her? That could be the case with an engagement ring.'

But if you must surprise the love of your life, he has encouraged blokes to buy a stone on its own and choose the setting once she says yes.

'Still blow her mind with the proposal, some jewellers will mount it on a mock setting, she can then help you choose the setting,' he said. 

*Look online, buy smarter

'There's 500,000 diamonds online instead of 50 in stores.' 

*Play with types of rings and their settings

'Diamonds are rated by the four C's, sometimes guys get too caught up in the clarity, but you can't really see the difference.'

*Understand what women really want

'Look at her style for hints and tips, matching different ring styles.'

* Don't spend outside your means

'I recommend setting a budget comfortable for you that is a meaningful amount of money.'

*Buy just the stone and get it set after she says yes

'Some jewellers will mount it on a mock setting, she can then help you choose the setting.'

'A lot of blokes don't know a lot of about jewellery at all, so looking at her style for hints and tips, matching different ring styles can also help.'

'It should get their thoughts a lot more streamlined, just giving them the info to get a great ring and save money.'

And he recommends, don't spend outside your means.

'It was(price of engagement rings) two months salary, it's now three months according to a Tiffany's campaign (laughs) but I recommend setting a budget comfortable for you,' said Alastair. 

'In one years time would you regret what you spent, don't get into debt, it should be a meaningful amount of money.'

The 31-year-old's book has also had some success already with his friend Sam Lyons taking on some of the advice, able to get a sneak peek before its release.

The 29-year-old had been with his partner Kat for five and half years before he decided to take the plunge into married life.

'It was really helpful, he said. 'When I first started thinking about proposing I kept it to myself, so I asked him to have a peek at an early copy and it gave me a lot of insight into what's involved.'

Sam (pictured left) and Kat (pictured right) became engaged five weeks ago. Sam sought advice from his mates' book before buying the ring and popping the question.

Sam believes the best advice was outlining how you can go online to play with the variables of purchasing a ring.

'You can go for less clarity and less colour for more of a carat and tweek it to your budget.'

'Had a brief look in shops and was bit blown away by the price, I was totally unaware to look online,' he said.

*Average cost of engagement ring

$5300

*Percentage saved by selecting the right diamond shape

42%

*Diamonds to choose from my (Alastair's) recommended retailer

810652 

'The whole process saved me money.'

'It's an easy read, knowing it is written by a man I can relate to, all info, everything a guy is looking for, think about it in guy terms.' 

So what did he buy and did the proposal, done overseas in Europe, to his fiance five weeks ago, all go to plan?

'She loved it, a white gold band, round brilliant cut diamond with a halo of diamonds around it,' he said.

'She was happy, she had no idea I was up to it and thought it was really nice.'

But Sam says the couple won't be rushing into a wedding just yet. 

'Wait a while, we have four weddings before Easter, see those out and travel plans. In about a year,' he said.
