Retired West Coast Eagles footballer Daniel Kerr remains in prison after failing to stump up his surety after criminal charges over a 'bizarre' and violent incident in Perth's northern suburbs.

Kerr, 31, was charged with two counts of endangering the life, health or safety of a person after an incident at a Glendalough property on Tuesday night at around 11pm.

Nine News reported he was involved in an alleged altercation and allegedly splashed petrol around the property and threw petrol at a man and a woman inside, before trying to set the property alight.

Neighbours are believed to have awoken from the drama in which they heard yelling.

'I heard a loud slamming of a door and it's sounded like an alarm had gone off,' a neighbour told Nine News. 

It's not clear as to what caused the outburst and behaviour or his relationship to the two people.

Kerr appeared briefly in Perth Magistrates Court on Wednesday where he was granted bail with conditions including a curfew between 7pm and 7am, and orders to stay away from the two complainants and two addresses.

But early on Thursday, a spokesman for the Department of Corrective Services said Kerr remained in Hakea remand prison after he failed to pay his $5000 surety overnight.

Details of the alleged incident and the identities of the complainants were not revealed in court.

Lawyer John Prior said Kerr acknowledged the allegations were serious.

In a statement, West Coast said the team was disappointed and saddened by news of Kerr's arrest.

'We will continue to support Daniel, who was an outstanding player for this club, to get the help he needs to recover from this situation and to get his life back on track,' the club said.

'As this matter is now in the hands of police, the club has no further comment to make.' 

Kerr made his AFL debut in 2001 and played 220 games for the Eagles, his only club while in the AFL.

He was a runner-up Brownlow medallist in 2005 and 2007, and won a premiership with the team in 2006.

But he was plagued by a series of injuries after 2008 and retired from the AFL in 2013.

Kerr's off-field indiscretions caused some controversy during his career including a scuffle with teammate Ben Cousins at a Perth nightclub and a prescription forgery scandal.

While in 2007, Kerr and his father also got into strife at a party and he was charged with assault. 

Nine News reported Kerr could be dealt serious punishment for the charges if found guilty including up to three years behind bars and a $36,000 fine. 

The case has been adjourned until November 26.
