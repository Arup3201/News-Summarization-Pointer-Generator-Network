A dog dislikes his kennel so much he has learnt how to tell his owner 'no' when he tries to put him inside.

The 11-month-old Husky, called Blaze, hates his kennel and can now tell his owner John Ventresco how he feels about it.

As his frustrated owner tries to move him, the dog uses his body weight to become a dead weight while continually 'saying' no.

Mr Ventresco uploaded the footage on YouTube earlier this month. The video currently has more than 50,000 views according to the aptly-named website The Blaze.

In 2011, MailOnline reported on a Husky called Misha who learnt to say 'I love you'.

The Siberian Husky specialises in saying 'I love you', 'hello', 'I'm hungry' and responding 'no' when asked if she is stupid.

She may not quite be at the stage of 
holding a conversation, but as far as mimicry goes, watching Mishka 
'speak' is extremely eerie.

Defiant: the dog uses his body weight to become a dead weight while continually saying no

The nine-year-old canine, who lives with her proud owner Matt Gardea in the US, is an internet sensation.

A YouTube video of Mishka talking - 
on her own YouTube channel, of course - has attracted 59million viewings
 since it was first posted in May last year.

She has also recorded her own song, Mishka's Ballad, albeit with the help of auto-tune.

The talking dog is so popular that has even been hired by advertisers to promote their wares.
