She may have designed a staggering seven lingerie collections and nine sleepwear ranges for M&S, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's creative talent shows no sign of waning. 

The model and lingerie designer has unveiled her Rosie for Autograph Summer collection - and it's full of mix and match pieces featuring sophisticated hues of slate blue and silver with colour pops of peach and  floral prints.

Rosie, 27, was inspired by all things oriental and she also incorporated the vintage glamour trend she does so well each season.

The Devon-born model sure likes the finer things in life; her designs, which are priced between £15 and £59, come in luxe silk and French designed lace. 

On Tuesday, the M&S lingerie model won the Model Of The Year at Elle magazine's Style Awards in London and these campaign images prove why.

According to Elle, they chose to recognise Rosie for her contribution to the industry over a career spanning more than ten years, during which time she has graced international catwalks for brands including Burberry, Prada, Givenchy and Balmain.

Speaking to InStyle last month, Rosie revealed that she likes her men to come a little 'rough around the edges.'

She described her interest in men's style by saying: 'I like men who keep it real and simple. I’m never attracted to a man who looks like he may take longer than me to get ready.'

'I like men in classic jeans, a T-shirt, and a cool jacket,' she continued. 'For the evening, a suit or a tux is always pretty hot.

Steve McQueen and Paul Newman are my kind of guys. Confident, cool, and a little rough round the edges!'

Next up for the model will be a role in the upcoming post-apocalyptic action film Mad Max: Fury Road, the first film of the franchise in 30 years. It's due in cinemas his May.
