Google Maps goes inside: Kings Cross Station gets the indoors treatment

With internet maps evolving so much in the last few years - and now becoming photo-realistic 3D - there seems little fresh territory left to explore, so Google has been doing some internalising.

The search engine has been plotting the insides of public venues across the UK, allowing Android smartphone users the ability to navigate around areas such as Kings Cross Station or the Selfridges shopping department in London.

The locations are currently very London-centric, although the search engine plans to roll out more venues across the UK shortly.

Microsoft's search competitor Bing has also begun mapping the inside world, with Bing Maps allowing you to explore nearly all major shopping centres across the UK.

Google spokesman Razia Ahamed said: 'Given the current British 
weather, we seem to be spending a lot more of the summer than we’d hoped
indoors.

'The thing about being indoors is that people often get lost - 
I’m not talking about in your own home, of course, but when you’re out 
and about, in train stations, museums, department stores and shopping 
centres.

'We’re happy to announce that today Google is launching 
indoor maps for Android devices in the UK.

'You’ll no longer need to feel
clueless when you’re at the railway station, trying to figure out where
to buy a coffee before you rush to catch your train from platform 11; 
nor will you feel embarrassed about asking for the lingerie section when
you’re in the department store - because you’ll have all the answers in
the palm of your hand.

'Just open Google Maps on your Android mobile phone, zoom in to 
the location you’re in and the indoor floor plan magically appears

'And 
for buildings where the information is available, we’ll even show you 
where you are on the map with a familiar blue dot if you’ve enabled the 
My Location feature.

'Next, search for the location you’d like to get to and we’ll provide directions to help you get there - even if you’re on a
completely different floor.'

Google has released a list of their supported venues here.

Ahamed added: 'More than 40 venues in the UK have 
worked with us to have their indoor floor plans appear on Google, 
ranging from train stations to art galleries, department stores to 
sporting venues.

'In fact, any building owner can upload their maps for 
future inclusion in Google Maps.'

Kings Cross and Euston are both plotted, and a toggle ('M', 'G') lets you move between different floor levels

Visiting the O2? Maps offers the ability to browse the popular gig venue 

Selfridges, all five floors of it, has been mapped out, and you can zoom and pan around the centre to find your chosen departments

Bing Maps has also been rolling out 
new indoor features, with 2,700 venues across the world mapped out, 
including North America, Europe and Asia.

The UK appears particularly well 
covered, with most towns having an internal map, discoverable on both 
Bing Maps, and the Windows Phone 7 and iPhone Apps.

A Bing spokesman said: 'Whether you 
live in Poland or Spain, Russia or Belgium, or pretty much anywhere 
in-between, you will now be able to explore your local shopping centre 
through Bing maps - helping you locate the stores you are looking for, 
find the closest services and facilities like restrooms and cash 
machines, and even browse their directories.

'Through Microsoft’s partnership with
Nokia, Bing Maps just boosted its Venue Map coverage in the US and 
internationally expanding the experience to more than 2,700 Venue Maps 
across the world. This update is primarily focused on shopping malls 
across North America, Europe, and Asia.'

The maps arena is certainly heating 
up, with Apple preparing to ditch Google Maps on iProducts in favour of 
an in-house version, and Amazon also getting in to the maps game with 
this week's purchase of mapping start-up UpNext.

Bing Maps has also introduced a similar feature, with most UK shopping centres mapped out, such as the town of Wellingborough, in Northamptonshire
