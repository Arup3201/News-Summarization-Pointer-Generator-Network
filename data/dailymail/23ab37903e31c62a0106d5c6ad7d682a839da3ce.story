A Utah animal sanctuary says a dog that escaped death in Indiana — a result of an ultimatum in the will of its late owner — has died.

Best Friends Animal Society said Tuesday in a statement posted to its blog that it euthanized the dog named Bela after tests revealed fast-growing cancer in the dog's lungs.

The sanctuary rescued the 105-pound German shepherd after owner Connie Ley of Aurora, Indiana, passed away in November.

Her will dictated the dog be sent to Best Friends or be put to sleep, cremated and mixed in with her ashes. Ley worried the dog was too aggressive and might pose a danger to others.

Brief reprieve: Bela the German shepherd died a little over a month after he was rescued after his Indiana owner died and willed he be euthanized and his ashes interred with hers

Best Friends says it will cremate Bela and send the ashes to Indiana to be interred with its late owner.

One month after his owner died and willed him to be killed and buried with her, Bela the German shepherd had a new home where he could live out the rest of his life in peace.

That life wound up being very short. 

Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah in December after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio.

Bela was rescued after animal lovers rallied to his defense and got a stay of execution for him early this month. 

When his owner, Connie Lay, died on November 25, she said that he should be either sent to the Best Friends shelter or put down, cremated and his ashes mixed with hers.

Ms Lay's attorney, Doug Denmure, said Ms Lay didn't have enough money to send her pet to Utah - so the only option was to euthanize him.

Sad: Bela arrived at Best Friends Animal Sanctuary in southern Utah in December after staff from the shelter drove him more than 1,700 miles from Aurora, Indiana - outside Cincinnati, Ohio. Over this past weekend, her was diagnosed with an aggressive lung cancer

The Best Friends family suffered a very sad and entirely unexpected loss over the weekend.

On Sunday morning, we had to say goodbye to the magnificent German shepherd, Bela, who captured our hearts over the holidays. Bela was the object of international attention and affection in the weeks leading up to Christmas, when it came to light that the will of his recently deceased owner contained a discretionary clause that placed his life at risk.

The will entrusted the late owner’s close friend to make the decision whether Bela should come to Best Friends Animal Sanctuary to live out his days or be killed and his ashes interred with his lifelong human friend. Following international coverage and arrangements with the deceased’s attorney and friend, Bela made a snowy cross-country car trip over Christmas with our trainer John Garcia.

On Sunday morning Bela’s caregiver noticed that his abdomen was distended and he was breathing rapidly, so he was brought to the Best Friends clinic for an emergency checkup.

Tests revealed fluid in his abdomen and also surrounding his heart. Most critically, X-rays revealed nodules in his lungs. Our medical director diagnosed Bela with a very fast-growing cancer and there was very little likelihood he would have lasted more than a very stressful day or so. Reluctantly, Bela’s caregiving team made the decision that euthanasia was the right option. This was a very difficult choice, as it is with any animal in our care, but we approached the decision from the perspective of what was the kindest course of action for Bela.

It is our custom to bury Sanctuary animals who have crossed the Rainbow Bridge at Angels Rest, the permanent resting place located in Angel Canyon. However, in this case we felt the right thing to do was to fulfill Bela’s owner’s last wishes. Therefore, we are cremating Bela and sending his ashes to Indiana so he can be buried with his owner, who passed away in November.

Bela was a great dog who made many friends and was quickly becoming one of the most popular dogs at the Sanctuary. Our staff had grown to love him as the sweet and wonderful dog he was, and every one of us who knew him is devastated by this turn of events.

Bela will be greatly missed.

News of Bela's fate was widely reported and sparked a #saveBela campaign on social media. Following outrage from the community, Best Friends stepped in and said the shelter would take Bela and have him transported to Utah.

Mr Denmure now claims it was never his intention to have the dog put down.

'It was this lack of information and the unfounded social media backlash about Connie Ley, myself, and the provisions in her will about her pets, that caused the delay in resolving Bela’s future,' he said, according to a blog post from Best Friends.

Bela was given a hero's welcome when he arrived to the Utah pet sanctuary but the happy new homecoming would soon turn tragic
