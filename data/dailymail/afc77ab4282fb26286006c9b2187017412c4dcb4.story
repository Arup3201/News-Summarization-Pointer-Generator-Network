A dream tropical wedding was almost cancelled after the groom found himself behind bars just four days before walking down the aisle.

Martin Lonsdale, 25, was targeted by corrupt police officers and their accomplices as he was relaxing with bride-to-be Kayleigh, 24.

Two conmen forced him into an unprovoked 'calculated attack' on a beach in Playacar, just south of Cancun in Mexico.

Happy day: Martin and Kayleigh Lonsdale's wedding hung in the balance after he was arrested by corrupt policemen

Mr Lonsdale was attacked by conmen, but he was arrested after the fight - four days before the wedding

Mr Lonsdale, from Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, and usher Rhys Quinn, 22, fought back after suffering a number of punches, but the brawl was quickly broken up by hotel staff and horrified onlookers.

Armed police soon arrived at their five-star resort to arrest Martin and Rhys and the pair were immediately thrown in jail.

The duo were were then beaten, strip-searched and humiliated by police, who took pictures of themselves laughing next to the naked men.

They were finally released 39 hours later when Kayleigh, and her terrified wedding guests, were forced to handover £2,600 in cash for their freedom.

Astonishingly, the conmen, who said they were from Chicago but who had thick Mexican accents, were thrown out of a different hotel just hours later for pulling the same scam.

'It was a calculated attack,' Kayleigh said.

'They saw a big group of British tourists and must have seen dollar signs. We just had no idea how corrupt Mexico could be.'

The couple had arrived in Mexico with 30 of their closest family and friends to tie the knot at a luxurious resort in September last year.

Humiliated: Mr Lonsdale endured an horrific ordeal at the hands of his captors

But on their first day at the Riu Palace Riviera Maya, in Playacar just south of Cancun, Martin and Rhys were confronted by two men as they headed back from the ocean.

Out of the blue one of the men pushed Martin, telling him 'back off', before punching Rhys in the face in an unprovoked attack witnessed by hundreds of holiday-makers.

A few hours later they were called down to the front desk to explain the incident to the hotel manager.

Mr Lonsdale, who is showing signs of post traumatic stress disorder following the incident, said: 'When we got to the hotel lobby there were two truckloads of policemen armed with machine guns waiting for us.

'They handcuffed me straight away and threw me in the back of a pick-up van.

'They even threatened to arrest my fiancee and my mother.

Mr Lonsdale said: 'They didn't question us or formally charge us with anything - it was terrifying'

Mr Lonsdale and usher Rhys Quinn were driven to a police station where they were strip searched and beaten

'The men that had attacked us were talking with the policemen and sniggering.'

The men were driven to a police station where they were strip searched and beaten, before being humiliated by both male and female plain-clothed officers.

'They pushed us against the wall and made us bend over while they took pictures,' the public services worker added.

'Then two female officers came over and knelt down beside my genitals posing for a photograph.

'When I pleaded with them about my human rights they said I had none. "This is Mexico" they said.

'They didn't question us or formally charge us with anything - it was terrifying.'

Martin and Rhys were then driven to an abandoned building in the middle of nowhere where they were handcuffed to chairs in the middle of a room.

A few hours later they were dragged through the building and thrown into a 12ft by 12ft rat-infested cell with 15 other men, all sharing a hole in the ground for a toilet.

Thankfully the couple stayed to get married, but the shock and trauma of their experience has clouded their otherwise perfect day

Kayleigh remained at the hotel with her mother, working with authorities to locate the men.

But to ensure their release the hairdresser had to plead with guests to help them with the bail, set at £1,100 per man, plus £400 for the solicitor's fee.

They were told the money was for their 'victim's injuries'.

'Martin is a 6ft tall, rugby playing man's man, but he was as weak as a kitten after they released him,' added Kayleigh.

'He was covered in bruises, and stank of human faeces.

'He was traumatised beyond belief and wanted to catch the next flight out of the country.'

Thankfully the couple stayed to get married, but the shock and trauma of their experience has clouded their otherwise perfect day.

The couple, who have been together for six years, have been through counselling since returning to the UK

Holiday provider Thomson said they were sorry to hear about Mr Lonsdale's experience.

'As soon as we were made aware of the incident our staff provided support to the customers and their families, and liaised with the British Consulate, Embassy and Mexican authorities.

'We have continued to offer guidance since their return to the UK.

'We would like to reassure customers that incidents of this nature are extremely rare.'

The manager of the Rui Palace Riviera May refused to comment on the incident.

A Rui Hotels and Resorts Corporation spokesperson said they were unable to comment further as the case was ongoing.

The couple, who have been together for six years, have been through counselling since returning to the UK.
