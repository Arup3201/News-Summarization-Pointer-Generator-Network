It's aimed at sharing short videos rapidly, and adding the same sort of 'hip' effects that have made Instagram a cult web hit

After Mark Zuckerberg's billion-dollar purchase of photo-sharing website Instagram, start-ups are vying to become 'Instagram for video'.

Effects-heavy video-sharing app Viddy pulled into pole position this week as it became the top free app for iPhone this week.

The service, which lets users share short videos is described as a 'Twitter' for video.

It's aimed at sharing short videos rapidly, and adding the same sort of 'hip' effects that have made Instagram a cult web hit.

'Since launching its Timeline app in February, Viddy has seen over 15 million interactions with its content on Facebook, with over 1.7 million users signing on,' says TechCrunch, which reported on the success of the new start-up.

'Viddy also says that it’s averaging 300K new registered users per day, an average that has seen a significant bump since February.'

'Turn everyday moments into perfect little movies with Viddy on iPhone,' say the app's creators. 'So next time you catch that pristine sunset over the Pacific, make it more than a memory. Then share it with your Viddy community and upload them to Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.'

Users can 'follow', 'like' and share videos as easily as via Instagram - and the service already has eight million users

The app has seen a huge increase in traffic after launching a Facebook Timeline app which allowed users to showcase videos via their Timelines

A Facebook Timeline app has added to the service's popularity - allowing users to record their life in short video clips, much in the same way as ordinary 'Timelines'

Clips recorded and shared via the service are limited to 15 seconds in length.

'If you’ve seen what Instagram has done for phone-shot photos, you can imagine that Viddy may soon do the same for videos,' the New York Times said in a review of the app

As with Instagram, the app includes effects such as vintage film styles, retro-style camera hues and advanced effect such as transitions and music tracks.

Viddy also allows users to share videos instantly via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Tumblr.

Videos can be shared publicly or with friends, and can be tagged and commented on, just as with posts on Facebook or Instagram.

Celebrities such as Jamie Oliver use the app to share their images with fans

While Instagram is just one of many 
photo-editing and photo-filter suites available for either platform, 
users give it a top rating for the ease of applying filters and the very
simple way of sharing images via sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Instanram also allows users to share images through its own sharing website, which has proved immensely popular with fans.
