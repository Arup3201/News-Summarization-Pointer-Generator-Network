A California appeals court today upheld a jury's decision that the promoter of Michael Jackson's ill-fated comeback concerts was not responsible for his death.

The 2nd District Court of Appeal issued a 39-page ruling a week after attorneys for the late singer's mother, Katherine Jackson, argued for a new trial. The court found the verdict in favor of concert promoter AEG Live LLC was legal. 

The three-judge panel ruled that Jackson's mother and children did not have standing for a new trial after their attorneys argued last week that AEG Live was liable for Jackson's treatment, and that jury instructions were confusing and not wide enough in scope.

The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that cardiologist Dr Conrad Murray (left) was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner by AEG Live overseeing Jackson's care 

The court also upheld rulings by a trial court judge that narrowed the case to a single claim that AEG negligently hired, retained and supervised cardiologist Conrad Murray later convicted of causing Jackson's death.

The self-proclaimed King of Pop died in June 2009 on his Neverland Ranch in California from an overdose of a powerful anesthetic while preparing for his much-anticipated 'This Is It' shows. He was 50 years old. 

His mother and three children sued AEG, claiming executives exercised undue control over the doctor and failed to properly investigate before he was hired. 

The Los Angeles Superior Court jury found that Murray was sufficiently qualified for the job he was hired to do as general practitioner.

Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for Jackson's death and served half of his 4-year sentence in a Los Angeles prison. 

A jury listened to five months of testimony during the 2013 trial before siding with AEG.

The sensational  trial offered a glimpse into Jackson's private life and final days in which Murray administered the surgical anesthetic propofol to the 'Thriller' singer as a sleep aid.

The justices noted that jurors seemed to understand the case and did not appear confused by jury instructions or the verdict form, as Katherine Jackson's attorneys have contended.

Lawyers for the 84-year-old Jackson family matriarch had been hoping to restore some claims against the promoter that Superior Court Judge Yvette Palazuelos dismissed early in the case, but the court found no basis to do so.

It determined that Dr Murray, the doctor convicted of involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, was an independent contractor of AEG and not an agent of the company.

'Today in a strongly worded opinion, the court of appeal found what took a jury two days to see through and that is that AEG was in no way responsible for the tragic death of Michael Jackson," AEG attorney Marvin S. Putnam said.

Kevin Boyle, an attorney for Katherine Jackson, said his office was still reading the ruling and did not have an immediate comment.
