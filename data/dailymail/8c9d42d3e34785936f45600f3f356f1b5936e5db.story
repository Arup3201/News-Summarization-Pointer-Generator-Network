Chinese authorities have said two religious extremists carried out a terror attack at a train station in an apparent suicide bombing which also killed one other person and wounded 79.

The official website for Xinjiang's regional government said police identified two suspects with a history of religious extremism, including a 39-year-old man from southern Xinjiang.

It did not explicitly call Wednesday's attack at the station in Xinjiang's capital Urumqi a suicide bombing, but said the two men detonated explosives at a train station exit and both died on the spot.

It was the third high-profile attack in seven months blamed on Xinjiang extremists that targeted civilians - two of the attacks outside the region - marking a departure from a previous pattern of primarily targeting local authorities in the long-simmering insurgency.

Chinese President Xi Jinping demanded 'decisive' action against terrorism after the attack, which came just as he was wrapping up a four-day tour of Xinjiang aimed at underlining the government's commitment to security in the region.

'The battle to combat violence and 
terrorism will not allow even a moment of slackness, and decisive 
actions must be taken to resolutely suppress the terrorists' rampant 
momentum,' Mr Xi said.

The blasts went off at about 7pm just after a train had pulled into the station and as passengers were streaming out onto a plaza near a bus station.

A 57-year-old woman being treated at the Xinjiang Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital said she had just arrived from Sichuan province and was walking outside to meet her son when the blast went off.

'I saw I had shreds of flesh and blood in my hair and on my clothes. It was terrifying,' said the woman, who would only give her surname, Peng.Â

Another survivor, a man who also gave only his surname, Liu, said the station exit had been crowded with people when the blast went off.

'After the blast, there was chaos. Everyone was panicking,' said Liu. Police and firefighters quickly arrived and Liu said the injured were taken to hospitals in ambulances and commandeered taxis.

The official Xinhua News Agency quoted eyewitnesses as saying at least two blasts went off at the South Station, while a large group of attackers went after passengers.

There was no immediate word on arrests and it was unclear whether Mr Xi was still in the region at the time of the attack.

'At the moment, it is acknowledged to be a terrorist attack. What is yet to be found out is who did this and for what purpose under whose instigation,' Xinhua said.

Train service was suspended for about two hours, Xinhua said, and security was tightened at all transport hubs in the city, which has a mainly Han Chinese population who are distinct from Xinjiang's native Turkic Muslim Uighur ethnic group.

Xinhua said the blast was centred on some luggage left on the ground between the station's exit and a bus stop

A woman working at a convenience store near the train station said she heard a loud explosion shortly after 7pm local time yesterday.

'The whole area now has been cordoned off by police and military police,' she said, refusing to give her name.

Photos circulating briefly on Chinese social media sites showed scattered luggage near the station's exit and a heavy presence of armed men.

Xinhua said the blast was centred on some luggage left on the ground between the station's exit and a bus stop.

Tensions between Chinese and Uighurs have been simmering for years in Xinjiang, particularly since 2009 rioting in Urumqi left nearly 200 people dead.

The attack came on the day that China's president Xi Jinping ended a visit to the region. He has now promised 'decisive actions' following the attack

Beijing has at times blamed the violence on overseas-based instigators, but has offered little evidence.

Last year, three Uighurs rammed a vehicle into crowds in a suicide attack near the Forbidden City gate in the heart of Beijing, killing themselves and two tourists.

In March, five knife-wielding men and women believed to be Uighurs slashed at crowds indiscriminately at a railway station in south-western China, killing 29 people.

While Beijing faults separatists for raising ethnic tensions, government critics say restrictive and discriminatory policies and practices have alienated the Uighurs.

They say Han people have flooded Xinjiang and benefited from its economic growth while Uighurs have felt excluded.

China has smothered Xinjiang with additional security and imposed additional restrictions on Uighur travel rights, culture and religious practices. That, say Uighur activists, is exacerbating the resentments driving the violence.

'The Urumqi explosion again proves that forceful repression is not a solution to the problem,' said Dilxat Raxit, a spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress based in Germany.

During his visit to the region, Mr Xi urged government officials to maintain social stability, promote growth, improve living standards and strengthen ethnic unity, according to state media reports.

'Local police stations are the fists and the daggers. We must work hard at the grass-roots level of the police stations,' he said.

'We must take care of our front-line offices. You need to protect yourselves and make achievements at tasks such as better serving the people in the future and safeguarding social stability.'

Mr Xi said China would deploy a 'strike-first strategy' in its fight against terrorism.
