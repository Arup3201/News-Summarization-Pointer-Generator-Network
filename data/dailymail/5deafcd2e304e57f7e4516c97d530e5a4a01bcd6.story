A fundraiser dubbed the 'British Forrest Gump' is celebrating after running the equivalent of 200 marathons across Canada dressed as comic book superhero The Flash.

Jamie McDonald, 27, from Tredworth in Gloucestershire, completed the epic 5,000-mile coast-to-coast challenge in 275 days, during which he was mugged, beaten up and forced to sleep rough.

He finally crossed the finish line in Vancouver yesterday, becoming the first person to run across the country without a support team - all the while raising £150,000 for charities dedicated to sick children.

After completing his ambitious journey, Mr McDonald said: 'I just can't believe it's over.'

'I have worked for so long and given this run everything I have, physically and mentally, that to finally dip my hand into the Pacific Ocean 11 months and the equivalent of more than 200 marathons after going the same thing in the Atlantic Ocean is just incredible,' he added.

'Thinking about all the people that have helped me along the way, whether it was offering a bed, or handing me a coffee, it brings a tear to my eye,' he went on to say.

Mr McDonald decided to run dressed as comic superhero The Flash after asking for costume requests on Facebook and Twitter.

He originally took up the challenge to show gratitude for the care he received as a child when he suffered from a debilitating immune deficiency and a rare spinal condition called syringomyelia.

Epic: Jamie McDonald's challenge began in March, using money he had saved for a mortgage to fund the trip. He has since passed through mountain ranges (pictured), national parks and run along numerous highways

Mr McDonald has so far raised almost £150,000 for sick children's charities including Great Ormond Street Hospital and Gloucestershire's Pied Piper Appeal.

His epic challenge began in March, when using money he had saved for a mortgage to fund the trip, he touched down in St John's in the Canadian state of Labrador.

He has since passed through mountain ranges, national parks and run along numerous highways.

But as he celebrated New Year's Eve in ski resort Banff, Mr McDonald was beaten up and mugged, with a bag containing film footage of his adventure, as well as cash and credit cards, stolen.

The bag was later returned following a Twitter campaign, but the robbery came as a huge setback.

During the challenge Mr McDonald ran for more than 2,000 miles with chronic tendonitis, went through at least 10 pairs of trainers, and has permanently injured and misshapen his foot.

He is no stranger to difficult tasks however, accomplishing the feat just two weeks after cycling 14,000 miles from Bangkok to Gloucester. 

Mr McDonald's father Donald and friends flew out to cheer him across the finish line yesterday, and his home town is planning a hero's welcome for his return to the UK on February 13.

He is due to be paraded through the town and a homecoming event will be held at Gloucester Cathedral.
