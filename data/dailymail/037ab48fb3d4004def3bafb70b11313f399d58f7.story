Outraged art fans have been bombarding the U.S. auction house handling the sale of a Banksy artwork that was gouged from a wall in North London with abusive calls and e-mails.

Details of the backlash emerged after a stencil of a rat holding a sign that reads 'Why?' appeared on the Haringey wall, next to the blank spot where 'Slave Labour' used to be.

It is thought the rat could be the reclusive graffiti artist's way of voicing his verdict on the row over his original piece, which depicted a child labourer sewing Union Jack bunting and appeared on the wall ahead of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee.

'Why?' The artist appeared to vent his feelings on the row

It is expected to sell for around £450,000.

Frederic Thut, owner of Fine Art Auctions Miami, insists the sale of the artwork is legitimate, but admitted he had been inundated with angry phone calls and e-mails from the UK.

'It's been said that the artwork was stolen, and that's just not true,' Mr Thut told the Guardian.

'We take a lot of care with our consignors: who they are, what they do, and if there's any illegality we will not touch it.'

The street art was stencilled onto the side of a Poundland shop in Wood Green in 2012 and protected by a perspex screen, but disappeared last week.

The Metropolitan Police have confirmed they were contacted by authorities in the U.S. regarding the Banksy piece. They were advised that there had been no reports of theft, Scotland Yard said.

U.S. officials had waded into the row after the disappearance prompted a storm of outrage by furious Haringey businesses and residents, the Evening Standard reported.

Mr Thut claimed it is being sold by a 'well-known' collector who 
is not British, but has refused to divulge any more information. He added 
that the painting was being stored in Europe.

Locals
 are furious about the painting being taken from the wall.

Councillor Alan Strickland
 says the artwork was a 'gift' to his community and has instigated a 
campaign to get the artwork returned by urging people to e-mail the U.S.
 auction website.

He said: 
'The Banksy appeared last May and created lots of excitement in the area
 - people were coming from across London to see it.

'We were really proud to have a Banksy in
 our neighbourhood, so residents were shocked to realise it had been 
ripped out of the wall.

Fury: Locals in Wood Green were left furious that a piece of free art was to be sold for profit

'The community feels that this art was given to us, for free, and it's now been taken away to be sold for huge profit. I'm very angry about the Banksy going - we want our Banksy back!'

Much of the controversial artist's work is believed to have a political message, and Slave Labour is believed to be a statement on sweatshops churning out decorations and memorabilia ahead of the Diamond Jubilee and the London 2012 Olympics.

In 2008 the graffiti artist Banksy revealed that millions of pounds worth of works attributed to him were fakes.

A body set up by the artist to verify his work identified 226 falsely attributed pieces in eight months in 2008.

He said at the time:'Graffiti art has a hard enough life as it is  -  with council workers wanting to remove it and kids wanting to draw moustaches on it, before you add hedgefund managers wanting to chop it out and hang it over the fireplace.

'For the sake of keeping all street art where it belongs I'd encourage people not to buy anything by anybody unless it was created for sale in the first place.'
