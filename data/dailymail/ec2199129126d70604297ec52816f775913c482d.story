 

A selection of candid images reveals what went on backstage at the original burlesque shows of the 1930s.

Shot by renowned photographer Margaret Bourke-White, who is better known for her work during conflict, the photos show scantily-clad dancers waiting to go on stage.

The late Bourke-White went behind the scenes with chorus girls in 1936 and pictured them setting their hair in neat waves and perfecting their pout in rustic Hollywood mirrors.

Pioneering Bourke-White from The Bronx, New York, was the first female photographer for Life magazine. She once said: 'The camera is a remarkable instrument. Saturate yourself with your subject and the camera will all but take you by the hand.' 

These previously unseen and lesser known photographs of burlesque and ballet dancers backstage are just some of her work on show at a new exhibition in her honour.

Held in the Daniel Blau gallery in London until 20 December, the presentation features contrasting facets of the photographer's work.

A selection of more than 60 vintage photographs includes incredible images of the Second World War in North Africa and Italy, which embody Bourke-White's courage and determination.

She became the first woman photographer to accompany the U.S. armed forces. 

While crossing the Atlantic to North Africa, her transport ship was torpedoed and destroyed. Bourke-White survived the attack and continued on her travels to Europe to cover the bitter daily struggle of the Allied infantrymen in the Italian campaign.

In the male-dominated world of early twentieth century photojournalism, Bourke-White was a pioneer.

In her extensive and diverse career, she photographed many historic moments.

Ballerinas of the Ballet Russe Pause

Bourke-White's intuition and dedication gave her the knack of being at the right place at the right time. 

She was the first Western photographer permitted to document Soviet Industry after the revolution, the first female war correspondent, the first woman permitted to work in combat zones and the first woman to fly on a bombing mission during the Second World War.

Bourke-White shot the first cover of what was to become the iconic LIFE magazine in 1936, the publication that would later send her to cover the Second World War. 

The exhibition will be on at gallery Daniel Blau, London from October 31 - December 20, Tuesday - Friday, 11am - 6pm. Also Monday and Saturday by appointment.
