A Missouri couple have returned home with their rare identical girl triplets more than one month after their birth, but they are still finding it difficult to tell them apart.

Brad and Laura Partridge from Des Peres, celebrated the successful delivery of their daughters Sonja, Sylvia and Scarlet, on March 19 - seven weeks before their due date.

Despite kitting them out with color-coded outfits, Mr Partridge told NewsmagazineNetwork.com that he constantly gets the newborns mixed up, especially when his wife sends photos and asks him to 'guess who'.

Bundles of joy: Laura and Brad Partridge show off their identical triplets, Scarlett, Sylvia and Sonja

Who's who? Scarlett wears pink, Sylvia purple and Sonja yellow as the parents struggle to tell them apart

'I don’t think I’ve gotten one right yet,' he admitted.

'We know it’s just going to take some
extra coordination and focus to make sure we don’t get them mixed up, 
but they’ll eventually be developing their own little quarks and 
personalities to tell them apart.'

However Mrs Partridge,34, is better at identifying her babies by looking at the shape of their faces.

'Our smallest, Scarlett, her face is still a little bit thinner and more petite . . Sonja, who has the biggest face, is a little fuller,' the mother-of-five explained.

'We know it’s just going to take some
extra coordination and focus to make sure we don’t get them mixed up'

However, she said as they grow and their bodies change shape it will become increasingly difficult to work out who is who.

'When everyone is at the exact same 
weight, once they’re bundled up in blankets and have their hats on and 
their eyes closed – it’s going to be like looking at the same baby times
three.'

Making it easier to identify their daughters the Partridges devised a nifty plan.

'Everyone
has a signature colour,' Mrs Partridge told MailOnline. 'Pink for 
Scarlett, purple for Sylvia and yellow for Sonja, and they have 
corresponding outfits.

Peaceful: Scarlett Partridge pictured ay the Mercy St. Louis Hospital shortly after her birth

Nap time: Like her sisters, Sylvia Partridge weighed over three pounds when she was born 7 weeks early

Baby steps: Sonja and her sisters remained in hospital for several weeks until their weight was up

'A 
friend is even getting me non-toxic nail polish for their toenails so that 
way we know for sure who's who in the middle of the night, or during a 
bath.'

After they were born the three sisters, who all weighed three pounds, remained in intensive care at Mercy Children's Hospital
until they reached certain feeding and weight goals.

The Partridges, who also have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 
17-month-old daughter, Stella, conceived the triplets without the use of fertility treatments.

Recalling the news that she was pregnant with triplets at her eight-week scan Mrs Partridge said: 'The doctor said, "There's one... There's 
two..." I was like, "What!"

'I honestly don't even remember her telling 
me about the third. They were sharing one placenta so we knew they would
be identical.'

The only multiple births on either side of the family are Mr Partridge's grandmother's twin sisters.

Growing: Laura and Brad already have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 17-month-old daughter, Stella. Laura was on bed rest in hospital for three weeks before they welcomed their little sisters

Brotherly love: The Partridge's son Stephen couldn't wait to have his sisters home

After their initial shock subsided, the Partridges grew concerned about the dangers.

'They told us the scary statistics,' she said. 
'We weren't able to celebrate like we were with our other two children. I think it
really wasn't until they were actually born that I could relax.'

The family is now overjoyed at getting to know the new additions; Mrs Partridge said that as well as being identical, they're even alike in personality and take it in turns to have a 'feisty' day.

The couple introduced their other children to the 
babies on Easter Sunday at hospital.

'It was a bit overwhelming for my 
son,' Mrs Partridge said of Stephen. 'He covered his eyes when he saw the babies because 
there were machines and tubes around.

'But he thought it was neat that they weren't crying and always talks about going to visit them at the hospital again.'

Delicate: Mrs Partridge returned home before her baby girls

Colour code: The family plans on painting the babies' toenails in the colours to make bath time easier

Support: The Partridges said family, friends and neighbors have rallied around to help out

The likelihood of having identical 
triplets is unknown, but some estimates range from one in 60,000 births 
to one in 200 million.

Obstetrician Dr. Gilbert Webb said the Partridge trio are only the third set of triplets he has seen in his 27-year career.

'It is extremely rare to have three babies share the same placentas,' he said. 'I'm so happy for Laura and Brad that their beautiful new babies are doing well.'

Mrs Partridge said relatives, neighbors and church friends have helped with the babies' return home.

'Everyone has been wonderful,' she said - and the love is paying off.

'They are all doing very well,' Mr Partridge added of his baby girls. 'They are our one in 200 million babies.'
