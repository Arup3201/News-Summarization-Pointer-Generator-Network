Five people were injured in a shooting outside a bar in the suburbs south of Seattle early Sunday morning.

The shooting in Skyway happened around 3:30 a.m. Sunday.

One person suffered life-threatening injuries and has been taken to Harborview Medical Center for treatment, detectives with the King County Sheriff's Office said.

Both men and women were hit in the shooting, KOMO-TV reported. Two others were treated for injuries in nearby hospitals, including one person with only minor wounds.

Details about the shooting were still vague midday because the victims were not cooperating with police, according to Sgt. D.B. Gates.

'Our understanding is that it happened in the parking lot,' Gates said. 'The club was either closing or had closed. A lot of people were milling around the parking lot, and that's when the shots were heard.'

Evidence gathered at the scene indicates that at least two guns were used in the shooting, and investigators weren't yet sure if the shooters were in a car or on foot.

'It's absolutely a possibility that this is gang related, and that may be why no one really wants to tell us what's going on,' Gates said.

Detectives were seeking witnesses and surveillance video from nearby businesses.

Other shootings happened in this area in 2010 and 2008.

Further details about the shooting and the conditions of those injured were not immediately available.

The sheriff's office said on its Twitter page that detectives 'will be [at the scene] for a couple of hours.'

A request for information to the King County sheriff's office from MailOnline was not immediately returned.
