A dying man’s wish to see his wife and kids one final time came true thanks to the generosity and hard work of a hospice in Pittsburgh.

Charlton Fisher, who is from Jamaica originally, left his family behind and came to the United States, so he could earn money for his oldest daughter to go to nursing school.

He worked as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in Bentleyville, Pensyvlannia to earn enough money to put his daughters through college.

Last wishes:Charlton Fisher's (right) dying wish was to see his wife and kids one more time. Thanks to the generosity of Pittsburghers that wish has now come true. His wife Marion, and daughter Ashley, 11 were flown in from Jamaica to see him

Change of heart: n the past three weeks, Charlton Fisher went from wanting to die to wanting desperately to live

We are family: Mrs. Fisher and her daughters including 11-year-old Ashley (pictured), girls arrived at Forbes hospice in Pittsburgh on Saturday night and have been there ever since

However, the 43-year-old is currently holed up at Forbes Hospice at West Penn Hospital because his heart is about to fail.

He began to have heart problems in 2012 while living in New York. In December 2012, he had to have heart surgery and he received a pacemaker.

While in Bentleyville, he traveled to New York for checkups, but he never complained or let on that anything was wrong.

One day in December, Mr. Fisher pulled his manager aside and asked for a ride to the hospital. His pacemaker had been jolting him as his heart function deteriorated.

With his pacemaker barely working he wound up in the hospital, and then was moved to hospice when things got worse. He says he couldn’t get up out of bed or even see.

Happy times: Back in Jamaica, Vharlton Fisher is seen with his daughters, Ashley, 11, and Asha-Kay, 3. he moved to the U.S. to earn money so they could have a better life back home and go to college

Together again: The family's visit from Jamaica has revived Mr. Fisher. Once unable to stand up or talk without sacrificing too much energy, on Sunday he was walking around, slow and weak, but improved

What next? Mr Fisher's mother-in-law lives in New York City, and plans are underway to transport him to a hospice there if he survives long enough

At the present time, he needs a heart transplant to survive, which is unlikely. The staff asked him what they could do for him.

'He said ‘I miss my wife and kids so badly,’' said Forbes Hospice Counselor Kevin Henry.

His former employer, Tejas Gosai, set up a computer in his hospice room and dialed his wife on Skype.

'Fisher was so happy and he said, 'I'd love to see them one more time before I die,' Mr. Gosai said.

Emergency papers were prepared and visas were issued for Mr Fisher’s wife Marion, his 11-year-old daughter Ashley and his 3-year-old daughter Asha-kay.

Mr Fisher’s boss at the hotels in Bentleyville, where he worked as a maintenance man, paid for the airfare.

On Saturday night, his family arrived to see him. He could barely believe it.

'So, so, so beautiful,' he said of the moment to KDKA. 'I was there waiting and then when the moment came, I couldn’t believe my eyes!'

'Till death do us part: Mr Fisher's wife Marion was so happy to see him. She intends to stay by her husband's side until the end

Emotional: Mr Fisher began to cry as he spoke about his family back home and how his one wish was to see them a final time

Sacrifice: Mr. Fisher came to the U.S. from his native Jamaica for work and ended up in Pennsylvania in February 2013, working as a maintenance man at a pair of hotels in Bentleyville. He did it to earn enough money to put his daughters through college

He started to cry when his wife talked about what it meant to her, and how she felt alone so far away in Jamaica.

Now they’re together. 'She stayed by me. She hasn’t left,' he said.

Family, it seems, may be the best medicine.

Since he arrived, he’s been walking, and he says his vision has improved.

His will to live also appears to have strengthened.

'I don't have a medical explanation,' said Randy Hebert, medical director at Forbes, to the Post Gazette.

'I've been doing hospice medicine for six years and this is the second time I've seen this,' he said.

'I don’t want to die yet, because I haven’t fulfilled my promise to my daughter,' said Mr Fisher. 'I don't want to die and leave my kids. I want to live some more. I want to live 10, 20 more years.'

To survive, Mr. Fisher would need a heart transplant, and it doesn't appear likely that it will happen.

Although Mr. Gosai has arranged for the family to stay at one of his other hotels in Monroeville, Mrs. Fisher said she's not leaving her husband's side.

He’s not well enough to fly, so he’ll be driven to New York City to stay with his mother-in-law. Again, his boss will pick up the tab.

He is hoping to get a new heartHis boss will pay for that as well, for which Fisher is extremely grateful.

He still hopes to get a new heart, but in the meantime having his family close by is enough to make his current one beat a little faster.
