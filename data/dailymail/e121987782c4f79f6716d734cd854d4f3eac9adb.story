This is the horrific moment schoolchildren crowded around to watch as the body of a perfectly healthy giraffe was chopped up before being fed to lions.

Despite more than 20,000 people signing an online petition to save two-year-old Marius, staff at Copenhagen Zoo yesterday went ahead and shot the animal with a bolt pistol.

Young children stood at arm’s length as his carcass was skinned and dissected before the meat was thrown to the lions.

The Danish zoo said the drastic move was needed to combat inbreeding and insisted the display was educational.

But
 animal rights campaigners last night condemned the killing of Marius, 
saying it exposed the cruel reality of welfare even in Europe’s top 
zoos.

Marius’s plight had 
triggered worldwide outpourings of protest, including an offer to rehome
 him in Britain, with many saying they were sickened by a zoo killing a 
healthy animal.

Copenhagen 
Zoo said it was told by the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria 
(EAZA) that Marius was genetically too similar to the other giraffes in 
its breeding programme. Because captive animals are bred from a limited 
gene pool, zoos are monitored to prevent inbreeding and ensure the 
health of future generations.

After
 announcing plans to have Marius put down, the zoo received offers of a 
new home – including one from Yorkshire Wildlife Park – as well as a 
private buyer who offered 500,000 euros (£410,000).

But
 bosses said the rules of EAZA membership meant animals could not be 
transferred to institutions that did not follow its rules on breeding 
programmes.

The zoo’s scientific director, Bengt Holst, said it was the same as parks culling deer to keep the whole population healthy.

He
 said: ‘Giraffes today breed very well, and when they do you have to 
choose and make sure the ones you keep are the ones with the best genes.
 The most important factor must be that the animals are healthy 
physically and behaviourally and that they have a good life while they 
are living, whether this life is long or short.’

Mr
 Holst said the zoo didn’t give its eight giraffes contraceptives due to
 ‘unwanted side effects on the internal organs’ and in order to allow 
animals to display natural parenting behaviour. According to Danish 
media, Copenhagen Zoo destroys 20-30 animals a year, including bears, 
tigers and zebras.

Mr Holst 
told the BBC spaces at institutions such as Yorkshire Wildlife Park 
should be reserved for ‘genetically more important’ giraffes and that 
the campaign to save Marius had gone ‘much too far’.

To
 supporters’ horror, the zoo yesterday announced Marius had been killed 
with a bolt gun instead of a lethal injection, which would have 
contaminated the flesh.

His carcass was then skinned and chopped up while visitors crowded around and the meat was fed to the lion population.

A
 spokesman said parents were allowed to decide whether their children 
should watch what the zoo regarded as an important display of scientific
 knowledge about animals, adding that it would have been ‘foolish’ to 
let the meat go to waste. Doncaster-based Yorkshire Wildlife Park, whose
 Danish head of ‘hoofstock’ offered to rehome Marius, said it was 
‘saddened’ by the news.

‘We 
have a state-of-the-art giraffe house built in 2012 with a bachelor herd
 of four male giraffes and the capacity to take an extra male, subject 
to the agreement of the European studbook keeper,’ it said.

However the park said it received no response by the time it learnt that Marius had been destroyed.

Stine
 Jensen, of Denmark’s Organisation Against the Suffering of Animals, 
said the killing showed Copenhagen Zoo was not ‘the  ethical institution
 that it wants to portray itself as being’.
