The FA were are considering appealing against an independent disciplinary commission for the second time in a week after Newcastle manager Alan Pardew escaped with a seven-match ban for butting Hull’s David Meyler.

The punishment, made up of a three-match stadium ban and a four-game touchline suspension, is a record for a Premier League manager but it is sufficiently lenient to spare Pardew further censure from Newcastle amid fears that he was in danger of being sacked by owner Mike Ashley.

But any sense of relief could soon disappear if the FA choose to appeal when they receive the written reasons for a judgement that has left Wembley officials slightly baffled; not least the decision to split the suspension between a stadium ban and a touchline one.

Appeal: The FA are considering appealing against Alan Pardew's seven-match ban for headbutting Hull's David Meyler

Clashing point: David Meyler had to restrained by fellow player Hull City player Ahmed Elmohamady

Anger: Meyler was seen pushing Pardew as the pair clashed when a stray ball went out of play

Fulham (A) - Sat 15 Mar (stadium ban)

Crystal Palace (H) - Sat 22 Mar (stadium ban)

Everton (H) - Tue 25 Mar (stadium ban)

Southampton (A) - Sat 29 Mar (touchline ban)

Man United (H) - Sat 5 Apr (touchline ban)

Stoke (A) - Sat 12 Apr (touchline ban)

Swansea (H) - Sat 19 Apr (touchline ban)

Arsenal (A) - Mon 28 Apr

Cardiff (H) - Sat 3 May

Liverpool (A) - Sun 11 May

Those written reasons are expected on Friday from a so-far-unnamed panel, and while the case underlines the independence of these disciplinary commissions the FA have yet again been left frustrated by their own disciplinary process.

Only last week it emerged that the FA wanted to see West Brom’s Nicolas Anelka suspended for double the five-match ban he received for his ‘quenelle’ goal celebration in a game against West Ham in December. The FA are considering an appeal against that judgement as well, with an announcement anticipated Thursday.

Clearly, the FA thought Pardew deserved a harsher punishment for his attack on Meyler during a game his team were winning comfortably.

In the wake of Paul Ince’s five-match stadium ban for a physical confrontation with a fourth official in the tunnel earlier this season, a stadium ban as long as 10 matches was thought to be possible.

Newcastle United are disappointed with the actions of its manager Alan Pardew this afternoon (Saturday, 1st March).

His behaviour was unacceptable and is not the behaviour we expect from the manager of Newcastle United.

It is most disappointing that this incident has taken the focus away from what was a fantastic performance by the team and an excellent result away from home which leaves the club in eighth place in the Barclays Premier League.

Sadly, the headlines tomorrow will not be focused on the result or the efforts of the players, but instead on the actions of our manager.

Alan unreservedly apologised immediately following the game to the player, to Hull City Football Club and its fans, and to the fans of Newcastle United.

We have held discussions this evening with Alan who has offered his sincere apologies to the Club and it is clear he deeply regrets his actions. Alan has accepted a formal warning from the Club in relation to his behaviour today and also a Club fine of £100,000.

The Club is now drawing a line under this matter and will be making no further comment.

As things stand Pardew will not return to the Newcastle dug-out until the final three games of the season, at the end of April.

Pardew attended the two-hour hearing at Wembley and an admission of guilt, as well as the mitigation he offered, was clearly well-received by the commission.

Nevertheless he will not be present for Newcastle’s visit to Fulham on Saturday.

He will also miss home clashes with Crystal Palace and Everton, handing control to assistant John Carver before returning to the stands for the visit to Southampton.

Then he misses home games against Manchester United and Swansea City and the trip to Stoke City. He will return for the Arsenal game at the Emirates on April 29.

Pardew has also been fined £60,000, on top of the £100,000 fine he received from Newcastle immediately after the incident.

Pardew said: ‘As I have made clear, I deeply regret the incident and again wholeheartedly apologise to all parties for my conduct, which I understand was not acceptable.

‘I will accept the punishment handed down by the FA today. My focus now turns to preparing the team for this weekend’s game against Fulham and finishing the season as strongly as possible.’ After the FA announced its decision, Newcastle issued a statement confirming their manager’s punishment.

It read: ‘Newcastle United can confirm that manager Alan Pardew will serve a seven-match suspension with immediate effect after admitting an FA misconduct charge following an incident with a Hull City player in the 72nd minute of the Barclays Premier League fixture on Saturday, 1st March.

‘An Independent Regulatory Commission today (Tuesday, 11th March) ruled the first three-matches imposed are a stadium ban with the remaining four a touchline ban.

‘Pardew was also fined £60,000 and warned as to his future conduct. The Club and Pardew have accepted the decision and now wish to draw a line under the matter.’

Heated: Martin O'Neill took exception to Pardew's over-zealous celebrations in the 2011 Tyne-Wear derby 

November 2006: Pardew had earlier in the year criticised Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger for failing to field an English player in the Champions League match against Real Madrid and matters came to a head in West Ham's 1-0 win over Arsenal. Then West Ham boss Pardew's enthusiastic celebrations appeared to irritate Wenger, who claimed he was 'provoked in a disrespectful way', with the pair having to be kept apart by the fourth official. On this occasion, it was the Gunners boss who was fined by the Football Association, with Pardew cleared of all charges.

March 2012: In a Tyne-Wear derby, it perhaps comes as no surprise that the tension boiled over, with Pardew, now Newcastle boss, clashing with Martin O'Neill following his celebration to Shola Ameobi's late equaliser in a heated match. Both managers pledged afterwards to keep their emotions in check in future.

August 2012: Pardew came under severe criticism and then afterwards labelled his behaviour 'ridiculous' when he shoved linesman Peter Kirkup in the Magpies' season opener against Tottenham after disagreeing with the official's decision to award Spurs a throw-in. Pardew once again apologised for his actions but the Football Association took a dim view and hit him with a two-match touchline ban and a £20,000 fine.

January 2014: Pardew became involved in another touchline row, less than a month after having heated words with Southampton boss Pochettino, with Manchester City manager Pellegrini. Television cameras clearly showed the Newcastle boss launching an expletive-laden volley at the Chilean. Pardew was spared punishment but said later: 'It was a heat of the moment thing, words we always have as managers, to a degree. I've apologised and I'm fortunate that he's accepted that.'
