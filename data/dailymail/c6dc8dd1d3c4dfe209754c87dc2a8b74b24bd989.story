Medical examiners found that a mother killed her two sons with the help of a sleep medication before hanging herself in their Florida home.

Dawn Brown is thought to have drowned her sons, ages 5 and 9, just hours after her husband said he was leaving her.

When he returned to their Clearwater, Florida home in the early hours of September 22, Murphy Brown found both of the boys dead, tucked in their beds, and their 34-year-old mother hanging from a ceiling fan.

The deaths have been ruled a double murder-suicide by state officials after the autopsies were completed on Tuesday.

The Tampa Bay Times reports that 
Zander, 9, and Zayden, 5, had unusually high levels of diphenhydramine 
in their system at the time of their death. The chemical is commonly 
found in sleep medications.

Though it is the working theory, 
county sheriff spokeswoman Cecilia Barreda said that they cannot be 
certain that the medication was used to make the boys drowsy or 
unconscious before 34-year-old Brown drowned them.

Brown had been struggling financially 
in the weeks and months leading up to the murders and neighbors said 
that the family's electricity had been cut off for days.

Her husband was believed to have told his wife that he wanted to end their eight-year on the night of Friday September 21 before going out for the evening in Clearwater.

In the early hours of Saturday, police discovered Mrs Brown and her children, nine-year-old Zander and five-year-old Zayden, dead in the suburban home after receiving a call from Mr Brown.

Friend and neighbor William Lavold told Tampa Bay Online that Mr Brown, 36, was distraught.

He said: 'He can't function. He can't figure it out. He's done in. He's really done in.'

Dawn Brown was charged last year with welfare fraud and had faced foreclosure on the family home several times. A neighbor was supplying them with electricity via an extension cord.

Authorities believe she murdered the children sometime on Friday night before hanging herself. The boys' cause of death will be released after an autopsy today.

A neighbor of the family, Nichole Bell, told the paper that the two brothers attended McMullen-Booth Elementary School with her son, who was one of Zanderâ€™s best friends.

'I can't believe it. She was so interested in her kids' educations,' Ms Bell said.

Bell told the paper that her son and Zander got in a fight at the bus stop on Friday morning and had to go to a guidance counselor when they arrived at school.

Mr Lavold said that he was like a godfather to the young boys and that they had planned to go out on his boat at the weekend.

Lavold said that he received a text about trouble at the home around 3am but only saw it three hours later and rushed to the house, by which time the mother and boys had died.

Authorities did not give a possible motive for the killings.
