The Chicago Brookfeild Zoo has given an adorable baby gorilla the name Nora today after four months of tallying votes from online fans.

Nora's 18-year-old mother named Koola gave birth to her furry girl back in November. More than half the online 70,000 votes cast for the baby favored the name Nora.

The naming contest ran from February 1-March 3 and zoo keepers are happy to no longer have to call Nora 'baby' or 'Koola's infant.'

The Chicago Tribune reports that the name Nora means 'light' or 'honor' and that it beat out other names such as Alima, Amelia, and Emma.

Fox reports that Alima is a river in the Republic of Congo where western lowland gorillas are from.

Amelia means 'flatterer' or 'industrious leader.' The name Emma also pays homage to gorilla researcher Emma stokes who discovered a large number of gorillas in the Congo.

Craig Demitros, the Chicago Zoological Society's associate curator of primates, told the Tribune that Nora has already taken a few  first steps steps.

Nora is still constantly by her mother's side but is showing signs of maturity as she is already able to hold up her head and look around.

'She'll occasionally mouth a piece of food that falls on Mom’s chest,' Demitros said.

'She's like a little kid. She'll pick stuff up and put it in her mouth. She just investigates everything.'

Demitros says that soon Nora will be able to exercise more movement.

'In the coming months, as Nora gets a little older, she will start riding on her mom's back and become a little more independent by moving and climbing on her own.'

Gorillas like Nora and Koola come from The Republic of the Congo

Before fans gave Nora her name, zookeepers called her things like 'Koola's infant'
