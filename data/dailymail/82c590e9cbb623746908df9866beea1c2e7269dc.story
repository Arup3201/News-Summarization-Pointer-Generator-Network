From the 'amateur' cook who was already a culinary champion to the infamous 'Alaskagate' episode, this series of Great British Bake Off hasn't been without its controversies.

Now former contestant - and last year's finalist - Ruby Tandoh, 22, has weighed in, calling editors of the show 'malicious' in their handling of Diana Beard, the grandmother who quit the show following accusations of sabotage.

'It was a case of the editors being, if not malicious, then at least completely thoughtless about how something would come across,' says Tandoh.

Tandoh, who has also taken to Twitter in defence of Beard, is no stranger to Great British Bake Off controversies herself, having been at the centre of a flirting storm in the wake of last year's final.

Subjected to shocking levels of abusive comments on the social media site, she has since spoken out about being dubbed 'a filthy slag' and declared herself horrified at the amount of misogynistic abuse she suffered.

Writing in the Guardian newspaper shortly afterwards, she said: 'The criticism ranged from the gently cynical to the downright obnoxious, but as the series went on I noticed an increasing degree of personal vitriol and misogyny.

'So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative.

Suspicious: This shot of Mrs Beard apparently removing Mr Watter's effort from the freezer caused a storm

'I have defended myself against accusations of being a "filthy slag" based solely on me being a woman on a TV screen.'

A year on and its clear that, the naysayer's efforts notwithstanding, she still has big ambitions where baking is concerned and is gearing up for the launch of her first cookbook, Crumb - The Baking Book.

She also remains unafraid to hit back at critics and has launched a broadside at feminists, who, she says, have no business telling other women that baking cupcakes is somehow unsisterly.

'The people who are most enthused by it [baking] are the younger generation,' she revealed in an interview published in today's Times newspaper.

Accusation: Miss Tandoh was accused of flirting her way to last year's final by social media users

Outspoken: She has now decried activists who say baking cupcakes is somehow incompatible with feminism

'People who were not raised on second-wave feminism, who don't have that instinctive reaction against domestic life.

'It's just something you do in your kitchen, nothing to do with your femininity or lack of, or success as a feminist.

'To love making cupcakes, for instance, doesn't make you a bad feminist.'
