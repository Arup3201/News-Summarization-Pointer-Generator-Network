Baroness Williams has said the downfall of her marriage, prompted by her husband's affair, was that he was 'vulnerable' to 'hopeful women'

Her first husband cheated on her then deserted her. But far from feeling bitter, as many women would, Shirley Williams insists she was partly at fault.

The veteran politician also blames the split on women who ‘pinioned’ Bernard Williams, saying the philosophy professor succumbed to their charms because he was too ‘vulnerable’ to resist.

Baroness Williams says her burgeoning career – she was a Labour shadow minister at the time – played a part in the collapse of the marriage and urges other women whose husbands leave them to look at themselves with a critical eye.

She rejected 12 proposals before marrying Sir Bernard, once described as the most brilliant and most important British moral philosopher of his time, in 1955.

They had a daughter in 1961 but ten years later he left her for Patricia Skinner, the young wife of a fellow academic. She is said to have offered to sacrifice her career as a rising political star if he stayed but to no avail and their divorce was finalised in 1974.

‘He [Bernard] was a wonderful man, a brilliant man but he was always a bit… vulnerable, put it that way,’ said Baroness Williams, now 84, yesterday. 

‘And of course because he was rather good-looking as well as frighteningly clever, he was pinioned by quite a number of – I have to say – hopeful ladies.’

The Roman Catholic added: ‘I’d been brought up with the view that if you were going to get married, then you had to be faithful – and you only got divorced in the most extreme circumstances.’

Her mother, the feminist author Vera Brittain, initially applauded her decision to marry Williams, telling her: ‘Of all the men you might have married, Bernard obviously has far and away the best mind, and he is also the only one who is capable of putting you before himself.’

Baroness Williams was happy in her second marriage to Harvard historian Richard Neustadt, who died in 2003 – the same year as Sir Bernard. 

But reflecting on what went wrong the first time, more than 40 years ago, she told the Radio Times she had stopped herself being consumed by anger by asking herself: ‘If your spouse indicates that they feel the time has come to break up, what did I contribute to that?’

She said: ‘You’ve got to understand how it is that he – who you loved – decided to leave you. And if you don’t begin to understand what you have contributed to it, your life will be destroyed by a sense of vengeance, anger, fury, injustice – and, you know, that’s not the way to go.

Sir Bernard Williams left his politician wife for Patricia Skinner (pictured above, left following his divorce from Baroness Williams)

‘You’ve got to come to terms with that single question – what did I contribute to this? And only when you have the answer to that can you actually then seriously think about why you broke up.

‘You mustn’t kid yourself that you’re the one who’s been badly treated – you just have to understand how it happened.’

Many regarded Baroness Williams as the woman likely to become Britain's first female prime minister

A former journalist before entering Parliament in 1964, Baroness Williams rose via the Shadow Cabinet in the early 1970s to become Secretary of State for Education and Paymaster General – holding both positions at the same time – as the only woman in James Callaghan’s 1976 Cabinet.

Many at the time regarded her, not Margaret Thatcher, as the politician most likely to become Britain’s first woman prime minister. 

After losing her seat in 1979, Baroness Williams left the Labour Party in 1981 as one of the ‘Gang of Four’ who founded the Social Democratic Party, before becoming a Liberal Democrat peer in 1993. 

Asked if she encountered sexism in Parliament, or was patronised, she replied: ‘It was more subtle than that.

'It was much more being treated as though you weren’t worth listening to.

‘That was one of the real problems but, to be fair, people like, not just Margaret Thatcher, the usual example but Barbara Castle even earlier, were quite substantial figures and they stood up for what they believed in and argued the case. 

'They did not fit into the agreeable, supportive woman concept. It’s about being taken seriously and not being treated as an ancillary figure.’

Meanwhile, a film version of Baroness Williams’ mother’s 1933 book, Testament of Youth, opens this week. Miss Brittain, a pacifist and feminist, was inspired to write it by the deaths of her fiancé, brother and two closest male friends during the First World War. It was adapted for TV in 1979.
