Murderers could be given US-style jail sentences lasting more than 100 years, under plans being considered by ministers.

David Cameron said 'life should mean life' as senior Conservatives draw up plans to change sentencing rules to overcome a ban on whole life terms being imposed by the European Court of Human Rights.

Sentences lasting several decades are understood to be one of the options put forward in a review of Britain’s human rights laws, which will be published in the coming weeks.

The Government, which is in an on-going row with the European court, is evaluating whether this would be the best way to give Britain the final say over sentencing.

English law allows judges to impose ‘whole-life’ tariffs, effectively sentencing a criminal to die in jail.

But the Strasbourg court said last year that such sentences were a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights, because there was no possibility of a ‘right to review’.

The court’s ruling means at least one multiple murderer has avoided a whole-life sentence.

Mr Cameron said during a visit to Southampton today: 'What I think is very clear, there are some people who commit such dreadful crimes that they should be sent to prison and life should mean life.

'Whatever the European court has said, we must put in place arrangements to make sure that can continue.'

Ministers have asked a panel to look at empowering judges to jail criminals for hundreds of years, which could have the same effect as a whole-life term.

However a British criminal sentenced to 100 years in jail could still be potentially eligible to have their sentence reviewed or reduced for good behaviour.

A government source told the Daily Telegraph: ‘The European Court of Human Rights seems to be making decisions a million miles away from what the vast majority of the public think.

‘They don’t want any possibility of the most horrible of criminals walking the streets again, and this plan could be a way to make sure that doesn’t happen.’

Long sentences are imposed in several US states as an alternative to the death penalty.

Ariel Castro, who kidnapped three women in Ohio, was sentenced last year to 1,000 years in jail, although he later committed suicide.

There are 49 criminals serving whole-life terms in the prison system of England and Wales.

One of them is Mark Bridger, 47, who was sentenced in May last year for murdering Welsh schoolgirl April Jones. He lodged an appeal last month against his whole-life term.

Ian McLoughlin, 55, avoided such a sentence because of the ECHR ruling.

He was told he must serve a minimum of 40 years after murdering Graham Buck, 66, in Hertfordshire in July, when he was on day release from a murder sentence.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling and Home Secretary Theresa May have both called for Britain to scrap the ECHR.

However they are now considering options to detoxify the issue ahead of the next election by drawing up plans to allow judges to effectively over-rule it.

The reforms have been drawn up by a committee led by Home Office minister Damian Green, under a new British Bill of Rights.

Mr Green has said: ‘British laws must be made in Britain. I want to restore the respectability of human rights.

‘I think it is absurd and damaging that the phrase human rights has become a “boo” phrase . . . this is not a technical or legal issue – this is a really big moral issue.’
