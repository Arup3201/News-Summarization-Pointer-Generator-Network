BT Sport are confident they will sign Gary Lineker to present Champions League football next season irrespective of whether BBC lose Premier League highlights to ITV in the upcoming auction. 

Sportsmail revealed this month that Lineker was being chased by BT Sport but it was thought any deal depended on the fate of Match of the Day. 

However, BT are hopeful they will land Lineker even if it means a renegotiation of the contract that gives BBC exclusivity on him in the domestic TV market until 2016. 

Gary Lineker took part in the FA Cup fifth round draw, broadcast on the BBC on Tuesday

According to Broadcast magazine, Lineker is in 'serious discussions' with BT Sport

Broadcast magazine also said Lineker was in ‘serious discussions with BT’ but a BT spokeswoman said talk around Lineker was ‘speculation’.

The former England striker, 54, also holds a contract with Arabic television channel Al Jazeera, with whom he presents Champions League coverage with. 

BT Sport spent £897million to secure Champion League coverage in November 2013.
