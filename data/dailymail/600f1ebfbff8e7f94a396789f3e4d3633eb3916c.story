A United Airlines flight from Nashville to Houston was forced to turn around on Sunday after a 43-year-old woman threatened another passenger who asked her to turn her cell phone off.

Lashonda Lee Williams, 43, is alleged to have told another female passenger, ‘I kill white people like you.’

She was arrested for assault by cops after the flight had returned to its gate at Nashville International Airport.

According to a court affidavit obtained by The Smoking Gun, another female passenger asked Williams to ‘turn off her cell phone due to the aircraft being in flight.’

Investigators noted that Williams told the other passenger – named as K. Colleen Coult, 50 - that she would follow her upon reaching Houston ‘and find out where she lived.’

The comments ‘created fear in Coult for her safety,’ the affidavit notes.

A United flight attendant told cops that Williams’s statements 'were causing anxiety and fear throughout the cabin.'

After being booked into the Davidson County jail, Williams was released on $3000 bond.

She is scheduled for a June 25 County Court appearance.
