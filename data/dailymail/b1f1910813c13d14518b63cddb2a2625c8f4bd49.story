Self-indulgent: The BBC has given extensive media coverage to its move from Television Centre in White City, west London, to nearby Broadcasting House, drawing the ire of some viewers

BBC executives have been accused of wasting licence-fee payers’ money on ‘self-indulgent’ coverage of the corporation’s headquarters move.

The last days at the old Television Centre and the move to Broadcasting House - which has undergone a £1billion revamp - has received rolling television coverage and at least 12 news stories on the BBC website.

It was even carried as one of the day’s top stories on the main BBC News on Sunday evening.

Dozens of viewers have taken to the BBC’s comment pages to vent their frustration at the coverage - which they branded ‘self-indulgent’, ‘self-obsessed’ and ‘self-congratulatory claptrap’.

Others pointed out that the offices were only moving ‘down the road’ and that it would make no difference to viewers.

One viewer said: ‘I do get sick and tired of irrelevant BBC stories about itself, its buildings and its employees.’

Another wrote: ‘This feels like a bit of a non-story to anyone who doesn’t work at the BBC.’

A third added: ‘Story is a good example of the self indulgence that my £145 assists in a small way in paying for.’

Dozens more comments were taken down by the BBC for breaching its editorial code.

The BBC is selling Television Centre in White City, west London, and moving five miles to Broadcasting House on Portland Place, central London.

The move was covered on yesterday’s flagship BBC1 News at One television bulletin and repeated broadcasts on the 24-hour BBC News channel.

The online coverage included a piece capturing the final Six O’Clock and Network news bulletins broadcast from Television Centre, along with a preview of the ‘fresh look’ for the BBC News Channel.

BBC's Broadcasting House is just five miles from Television Centre, yet the move was covered in 12 stories on the website

Web pages included a photo gallery showcasing the ‘beauty’ of Television Centre and a blog asking, ‘Where does television broadcasting go from here?’

BBC correspondent Nick Higham presented a number of video pieces exploring the high-tech Broadcasting House, including one in which he gave veteran reporter Martin Bell a tour of the building before showing historic excerpts of Mr Bell’s work.

A BBC spokesman last night defended the coverage.

HQ: The BBC has been located at Television House since 1960. It is where Doctor Who, Fawlty Towers and Blue Peter came to life

He said: ‘The move of the BBC’s domestic television news output to Broadcasting House is an important milestone for the BBC as a news organisation.

‘For the first time, the BBC brings its journalists who serve UK and global audiences across television, radio and online together in a purpose-built digital newsroom, which in turn will strengthen the quality of the BBC’s news output for its audiences.

‘We felt it was important to share the changes with them and introduce them to the new home of BBC News.’
