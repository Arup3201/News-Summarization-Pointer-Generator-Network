This month marks a year since Father Rod Bower put up his first controversial message on the signage board outside Gosford Anglican Church.

The message read: 'Dear Christians, some people are gay. Get over it. Love God'.

It was a statement that certainly grabbed the attention of not only local passersby but also gained an international audience.

And his outspoken views were not just confined to gay marriage. His thoughts on Australia's asylum seeker policy, climate change and coal seam gas have also been expressed in huge letters.

This month marks a year since Father Rod Bower put up his first controversial message which he shared on the signage board outside Gosford Anglican Church, in the Central Coast - north of Sydney

Since then, the church's Facebook page has taken off - now with 12,607 likes

Now, Father Bower shares what's on his mind almost on a daily basis, displaying new messages on the board on NSW's Central Coast, north of Sydney.

His unique way of engaging with the community began when he was visiting a dying man who's family tried to hide the fact that he was gay.

Father Bower said he didn't want people to assume that he was anti-gay because he was Christian and a priest

'That's when I thought to myself: "hang on, I don't want people to assume that just because I'm a Christian and I'm a priest that I would be anti-gay",' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Because I'm not. I'm actually a very vocal supporter of marriage equality.

'So I wanted to say to the community, don't assume that all Christians are conservative.'

Since then, the church's Facebook page has taken off - now with 12,607 likes.

'It's just incredible. On a good week we get up to 300,000 views,' he said.

'Itâ€™s not unusual to get about 80,000 to 100,000 views.'

But Father Bower's progressive views haven't gone without criticism.

While other conservative priests have confronted Father Bower for his beliefs, he's also received threats and abuse from the public.

'Lots of hate mail, hate emails, hate tweets and hate posts,' he said.

'The ban button gets a bit of a work out sometimes.'

A spokeswoman for the Anglican Diocese of Newcastle, which the Gosford parish belongs to, declined to comment on Father Bower's views.

What the priest finds most concerning is the level of hatred Australians have towards others.

'I think the ones that I find most deeply disturbing are the ones targeted at vulnerable people,' he said.

'People saying things like "if they [refugees and asylum seekers] all drowned that would solve the problem".'

One particular anonymous hate mail still remains in the forefront of his memory.

The priest says he disagrees with Australia Prime Minister Tony Abbott's stance on asylum seekers

Father Bower hopes to 'promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for, in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish'

'Someone sent me a photocopied image of the boat breaking up on Christmas Island,' he said.

'He pasted a carton of beer and a bottle of champagne on the picture and wrote "this is something to celebrate".

'It was a graphic example of the kind of heart that I want to change.'

Although the positive response definitely outweighs the bad, Father Bower says the criticism can 'some days eat into your soul a bit'.

He believes media moguls like Rupert Murdoch sometimes have a negative influence on society.

'I think responsible journalism is one of the greatest gifts that can be given to a democracy,' he said.

'But I think when a powerful media provider is so focused on one area of the political spectrum, I think that can be very unhealthy for society.'

So Father Bower wants his message of compassion and generosity to be loud and clear.

'For me it's really about the heart and emotion. Who we are as people and who we want to be as people,' he said.

'I hope to promote a society in which the vulnerable are cared for, in which the minority are embraced and in which human beings can flourish.'

The Anglican priest says responsible journalism is an essential element to a healthy democracy. However he found that media mogul Rupert Murdoch 'focused on one area of the political spectrum'

Father Bower said he received a lot of criticism from other conservative priest and also was sent hate mail from the public about his view on marriage equality
