Britain’s house price boom is showing no sign of slowing – after fresh figures released today revealed the cost of buying a house has increased 11.7 per cent over the past year.

The average cost of a house in the UK hit a new high of £274,000 in August, as increases in London and the South East fuelled a nationwide jump in prices.

In the capital property prices jumped by 19.6 per cent – with the average home now worth £514,000.

London properties continue to pull away from the rest of the country, according to this morning's ONS figures

The average cost of a home in London is now almost twice as much as elsewhere in the country

The increasing cost of housing is making it increasingly difficult for first-time buyers to get their foot on the ladder.

In August, prices paid by first-time buyers were 12.9 per cent higher on average than the same time last year.

The average price for properties bought by first-time buyers increased was £210,000.

England continued to see the largest house price growth across the UK – with properties going up in value by 12.2 per cent in the year to August.

The cost of buying a home in Wales was up 4.7 per cent, while in Scotland prices jumped 6.7 per cent. Northern Ireland also enjoyed strong house price growth – with property values up 9.6 per cent over the year.

England’s housing boom was driven by the capital – but also by East Anglia and the wider South East.

In the areas around London prices jumped 12.3 per cent, while ‘the East’ region saw the cost of properties increase by 11.6 per cent.

Excluding London and the South East, UK house prices increased by 7.8 per cent in the 12 months to August 2014.

The North East has the lowest average house price at £154,000. London, the South East and the East all had prices higher than the UK average price of £274,000.

Excluding London and the South East, the average house price across the country was £208,000.

House prices are continuing to soar across the country - driven by runaway property costs in London and the South East

After a big drop in price rises during 2009 prices have carried on booming in the property market

Labour this morning raised concerns that soaring prices were making it increasingly leaving workers behind.

Catherine McKinnell, Labour’s Shadow Treasury Minister, said: 'Total pay is rising at just 0.6 per cent.

'Working people whose real wages have fallen by £1,600 a year since 2010 face a further hit if the Tories win the election and cut tax credits again.'

A rise in interest rates could be delayed until the middle of next year after inflation dropped to a five-year low.

Cheaper travel, restaurants, books and gadgets like tablets and laptops meant the CPI rate of inflation was just 1.2 per cent in September, well below the Bank of England's target of 2 per cent, and the lowestr since September 2009.

Low inflation removes any immediate pressure on the Bank to raise interest rates amid the continuing uncertain recovery in the wider economy.

New figures from the Office for National Statistics show the CPI rate of inflation has fallen to just 1.2 per cent

The Office for National Statistics said the fall from 1.5 per cent in August had been sharper than expected.

For the fifth month in a row food bills fell, down by 1.4 per cent year-on-year, the steepest drop since June 2002.

It is the longest sustained period of flat or falling food prices since the end of 2004.

Low inflation is good news for millions of families who have been struggling to cope with rising bills.

Latest figures show that average wages are rising by 0.7 per cent year-on-year, so even with 1.2 per cent inflation incomes are being outstripped by rising prices.

Prime Minister David Cameron said: 'It's good news that inflation remains low. Our long-term economic plan is delivering more financial security and stability for families.

'Today's inflation figures mean a big real-terms increase in the state pension next year - helping people who've worked hard all their lives.'

The Bank of England targets inflation at 2 per cent but it has now been below this level for nine months in a row.

With inflation falling, the Bank will be reluctant to put up interest rates amid fears it could stifle the recovery. 

Cheaper transport and computer prices and lower bills in restaurants were the biggest factors for the lower rate of inflation, the ONS said

Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit, said: 'With oil and petrol prices falling, import costs dropping due to the exchange rate, supermarkets engulfed in price wars and wage growth at a record low, it's hard to see why inflation should do anything other than fall further in coming months,.

'This more benign inflation outlook should certainly take pressure off the Bank of England to raise rates, and could even add to calls for policy-makers to do more to shore up the recovery amid signs that growth could fade in coming months.

'While a few months ago, the likelihood was growing that the Bank might need to hike interest rates in late 2014 or early next year, the data are now stacking up to suggest a hike could be delayed at least until next summer, after the general election.'

ING Bank economist James Knightley said: 'With inflation substantially below the Bank of England's 2 per cent target and the eurozone growth outlook appearing to deteriorate, there is little pressure to tighten monetary policy any time soon.

'This means our February prediction for the first rate hike may be a little early.'

Soaring house prices have been hitting the headlines, but there are plenty of things you can do to try and reduce the cost of buying a home.

The most significant is picking the right type of mortgage for you.

There are hundreds, if not thousands, of options out there, so, as well as doing your own research, this is an occasion to search out expert opinion from a good mortgage broker.

Then also check the top mortgage deals on offer currently in our best buy mortgage tables, or click through by using our helpful table (right).

You should now be armed with some knowledge about what is on offer and you can use our True cost mortgage calculator to compare how different deals stack up.

You should also talk to a mortgage broker. There is no obligation to go through with their recommendation and so they may not end up actually arranging the mortgage for you, but they will be able to explain your options and help you to find the best deal.

Go a broker who offers advice from the whole market. Avoid brokers who offer a restricted service based on products from a limited number of lenders, and don't just simply go to your bank - unless you get lucky, you will be unlikely to find the best deal this way
