A plane spotter has captured the nerve-wracking moment an easyJet flight was forced to abort its landing as strong winds battered Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport.

In the 90-second video, the Airbus A319 appears to be fine as it rapidly approaches the runway but at the last second it suddenly tilts sharply to the right.

The aircraft’s rear right wheels briefly touch down as the plane is whipped by powerful wind gusts.

That’s when the plane suddenly pulls up and soars back into the dark skies over the airport to attempt another landing.

The video shows the Airbus A319 landing safely on its second attempt several minutes later.

The clip has had over 30,000 views since it was uploaded to YouTube over the weekend by a plane spotter known online as Schipholhotspot.

He wrote: ‘This second approach is still difficult because the conditions have not changed much in the time it took the plane to go around.’

easyJet says it was 'a routine go-around procedure' and passengers and crew were not in danger

An easyJet spokeswoman said the landing was aborted as a precautionary measure

She said: ‘easyJet can confirm that this aircraft is performing a routine go-around procedure – at no point was the safety of the passengers and crew compromised.

‘Our pilots are highly trained to perform “go arounds” as a precaution and in line with our procedures.

‘The safety of its passengers and crew is the airline’s highest priority.’

The spokeswoman for the Luton-based airline said she was unaware of the flight's origin and the number of passengers and crew on board because go arounds are a routine procedure and are not required to be recorded.
