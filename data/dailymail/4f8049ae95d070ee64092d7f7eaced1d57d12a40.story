They're only kidding about the discovery, of course - it's one of a string of hoax new products and services the online ads giant revealed for April Fool's Day.

But the new Treasure Mode is such fun that observers are nonetheless hoping that it will actually last beyond the annual day of tricks and tomfoolery.

Me hearties! Google today announced the introduction of Treasure Mode following the discovery of the long lost maps of pirate Willian 'Captain' Kidd during an underwater exhibition

Google has led the way in jolly tech-related April Fool's japes, with its Treasure Mode joining Gmail Blue, Google Nose and the announcement that YouTube has in fact been an eight-year competition to find the best video.

The Google Maps blog explains how its Street View team found Captain Kidd's maps during a recent expedition beneath the waves of the Indian Ocean to expand their underwater Street View collection.

They published an accompanying YouTube video about the 'find'.

'When Dr. Marco Meniketti, an independent archaeologist, confirmed that this was Captain Kidd’s 315 year-old map, we were very excited,' writes Google software engineer Tatsuo Nomura in the blog post.

'However, as seen in the video, the map contains a variety of encrypted symbols and is not readily decipherable. We need your help to decipher these symbols and find Captain Kidd’s treasures; therefore we’ve decided to digitize the map and make it accessible to everyone.'

Do not attempt at home: In an accompanying YouTube film, the Maps team explain that some of the clues can only be revealed in special circumstances, such as when the maps are heated

c by clicking on the 'Treasure' button in the top right corner of Google Maps, and follow the hunt's progress on Google Maps G+ page.

However, the site warns: 'Treasure Maps is our Beta Maps technology and has certain system requirements. Your system may not be able to display at higher resolutions than paper print.

'Take care when unfolding the map to avoid ripping it.'

Google's other April 1 practical joke pokes fun at its latest Glass project, with the revelation that Google Nose is the newest addition to the the search engine's capabilities.

Google Nose apparently allows users to search the 'Aromabase' of more than 15million Scentibytes then catch a whiff of everything from wet dog to dust bins.

There is also the announcement that YouTube is shutting down at midnight - to allow a panel of experts to pick the best video ever for when the site relaunches in 2023.

The hilarious clip includes comments from some of the site's biggest stars including the little boy who had a dazed conversation with his father following a dentist appointment and Judson Laipply from 'Evolution of Dance' clips.

But Google is not the only one breaking out a sense of humour for the start of the month.

Twitter announced that from April 1, Twitter would become Twttr as the micro-blogging site cancelled the use of vowels. If you want the use of a,e,i,o, or u, then it will cost five dollars a month.

'We’re doing this because we believe that by eliminating vowels, we’ll encourage a more efficient and “dense” form of communication,' announced Twitter's director of product Kvyn Wl (sic) on its blog this morning.

Sacla's new pasta for the Twitter generation could've proved a geek-chic hit... had it been for real

He added: 'Twttr will roll out slowly to a small percentage of users, growing to 100% over the next few days. We recommend that you practice using only consonants (and “y”) with the hashtag #nvwls (or if you have paid for our premium service, use #icanhasvowels).'

The company even went so far as to produce a companion website that can translate any tweet into its vowel-less equivalent and re-created Obama's most-tweeted 'four more years' message from last year in the new format.

Continuing the Twitter theme, Italian food brand Sacla added a touch of tech to its April Fools joke with the announcement of its latest product, Twitteroni pasta.

Rather like the tinned alphabet soups of your youth, Twitteroni pasta is shaped into letters, but also includes hashtags and the 'at' symbol

With the trend in tech moving towards packing ever-greater computing power into ever-smaller gadgets, Sony's April Fool's gag could almost be believable.

The company is advertising the world's smallest laptop on its website, the 0.75in by 1.25in Vaio Q, which is about the size of a pound coin but nevertheless packs 8Gb RAM and a 3D capable display.

The catch? Users must peer at its tiny screen through an antiques-dealer style magnifying monocle - and any attempt to add to your Sony Store cart is greeted with the message: 'April Fools!'

The 3D-printing enthusiast is not left out in the April Fool's new product campaigns covering the web today.

ThinkGeek's Play-Doh 3D printer is iPad compatible and comes with three pots of the child's modelling stuff to get you started - and costs just $50, if it were real.

The tech-enthusiast gadget site didn't stop there, however. Its inventive staff have come up with seven other improbable inventions - including the Eye Of Sauron Desk Lamp and the macabre Batman Family Car Decal set - which it put right at the top of its home page.

And the best part? If any customers really like any of the fake new products, they are encouraged to write in to tell the company to market them for real...
