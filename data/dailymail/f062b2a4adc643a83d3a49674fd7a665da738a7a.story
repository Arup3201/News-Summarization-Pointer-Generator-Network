Arsene Wenger does not believe there is a problem with the intensity of Arsenal's training after Per Mertesacker suggested they need to work harder.

Mertesacker made his comments in the wake of the Gunners' fortunate 2-1 Champions League win in Anderlecht, in which they required two goals in the final minutes to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. That result came on the back of another disappointing home draw against Hull last Saturday.

Wenger said: 'I don't know what he meant by that. But you have to be careful with statements after the game. I think we train very hard, the attitude is right and the spirit is there.'

Arsenal laboured once again during their clash at Anderlecht on Wednesday night

'Until now we have been relatively consistent in our attitude but not efficient enough offensively or defensively.

'We lost only two games (in all competitions) but we have not made enough points.'

Mertesacker had offered stinging criticism of both Arsenal's style of training and style of play following yet another poor performance in Belgium. The north London outfit are already 11 points off Chelsea in the Barclays Premier League title race after drawing five of their opening eight matches.

'We are not at our best,' the Arsenal vice-captain said. 'Football-wise we lack a few things. We have to be honest to ourselves and train harder. 

'Everyone knows that it is a difficult start to the season for us and confidence is not how we want it.

But Arsenal are well off the title pace set by Chelsea after drawing against Hull last Saturday

'I think we have to do better with our own possession, to put more pressure on them [opponents], not to lose so many balls in the middle of the park, to play more in wide areas.

'I think it is better to expose them there, instead of playing one-twos through the middle. It doesn't work as much as last season, so we have to work on that. The passing game is not as efficient as last year. But all of a sudden we lose players week-by-week.'

Wenger indicated Theo Walcott will not be ready to play this weekend against Sunderland after a nine-month lay off with a serious knee injury.

He said: 'He has to get used to contact again. He has been out nine months, he needs to get used to being kicked again. He needs to feel completely confident but he is not far. Fitness wise he is there. Contact front he needs a bit more time.' 

Arsenal travel to the Stadium of Light hoping to take advantage of a team still in shock from the 8-0 hammering they received at Southampton last week. But Wenger warned his men to expect a fightback from Gus Poyet's side.

'We expect commitment and fight for 90 minutes and we have to prepare for that,' he said. 'The result will have dropped their confidence and increased their resolve.'
