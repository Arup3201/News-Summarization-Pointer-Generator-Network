Paul Ryan has revealed himself to be a fan of a second intense fitness regime, just days after admitting that he owes his super-fit body to P90X.

The 42-year-old Republican from 
Janesville, Wisconsin, who is Mitt Romney's new running mate, said that he alternates with another concept, called Insanity, in a new interview.

When asked how he maintains his 163lb frame, at just 6-8per cent body fat, he told the new issue of People magazine: 'I do the P90X [DVD cardio] workout and  [another program called] Insanity. And I try to eat well.'

Mr Ryan, a former personal trainer who is 6ft 2in tall, added that his one diet 'weakness'
was that he liked to drink coffee in the morning - which, by most 
peoples' standards, is a guilt-free indulgence.

The Insanity workout claims to be 'the hardest fitness program ever put on DVD'. claiming to burn up to 1,000 calories in an hour, it is based on 'plyometric drills' - exercises that comprise of long bursts of fast and powerful movements to develop muscle power and to improve speed.

Additionally, users are put through their paces with non-stop intervals of strength, power, resistance, and abdominal and core
training.

The father-of-three has also revealed how has been was inspired to stay fit and healthy since the age of 16, when he found his 
father dead in his bed in 1986. The 55-year-old 
had suffered from a fatal heart attack.

Mr Ryan, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, is also a keen fan of P90X, which aims to confuse muscles by blending exercise, yoga 
and martial arts moves.

The regime, which, like Insanity, involves learning fitness moves from a DVD, is broken down into a range of cardio activities, pull-ups, push-ups, karate and yoga.

'I'm kind of a skinny guy', he told Politico.com in March before revealing that he leads P90X workouts along with fellow politician Bart Stupak every morning on Capitol Hill.

He added: 'There's about a dozen of us who do it... It's a fantastic workout.'

House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy is also said to take part in the daily workout which begins at 6am.

Sounding
like a true convert, Mr Ryan, who detailed that he drinks two cups of 
coffee every morning in addition to working out, said: 'It pushes your 
body in many different ways so that it gets out of its plateau. It has 
results. It works.'

Founded by Tony Horton, an exercise instructor from Rhode Island, P90X is a home exercise system that aims to transform a person's body in just 90 days.

Muscles confusion is said to prevent a person from adapting to exercise, which results in continuous fitness improvement.

As the workout changes from day to day, he added that it offers a unique take on regular fitness routines.

Mr Ryan wears a heart-rate monitor when he works out and aims to hit a target heart rate of 165 beats per minute.

The
youngest of four children, Mr Ryan has also described the heartbreaking
moment when he discovered his father in bed 
after he was struck by the heart attack.

'It was just a big punch to the gut,' he told The New Yorker magazine. 'I concluded I've for to either sink or swim in life.'

The trauma of such a discovery had a severe impact on their entire family.

Mr Ryan's mother, Elizabeth, was forced to go back to college to study interior design in order to support her children.

His grandmother moved back into the family home in order to care for Mr Ryan and his siblings while their mother attended college.

The politician now loves staying 
active as much as he can and also enjoys deer hunting and skiiing, 
revealing to CNN that at one stage of his life, he was forced to ditch a
chance to forge a professional career in skiing in order to pursue 
politics.

He even admitted that he 'sometimes' regrets the decision.

More than three million copies of P90X have been sold since the program was created in 2004, raking in an estimated $420million.

Along with DVD videos, the program comes with a nutrition guide, fitness plan and calendar.

Mr Romney described Mr Ryan as man of integrity and character rooted in his middle-class Midwest upbringing as well as an intellectual leader at a time when the United States was in fiscal crisis.

'Paul is a man of tremendous character, 
shaped in large part by his early life,' he said. 'Paul's father died 
when he was in high school. That forced him to grow up earlier than any 
young man should.

'But Paul did, with the help of his devoted mother, his brothers and 
sister, and a supportive community. And as he did, he internalized the 
virtues and hard-working ethic of the Midwest.

'Paul Ryan works in Washington - but his beliefs remain firmly rooted in
Janesville, Wisconsin. He is a person of great steadiness, whose 
integrity is unquestioned and whose word is good.'

He praised Ryan's prowess in politics,
saying that 'There are people that may disagree with Paul Ryan, but I 
don't know of anyone that doesn't respect his character and judgement.'

The pair are currently in the midst of a four-day bus tour of key swing states.
