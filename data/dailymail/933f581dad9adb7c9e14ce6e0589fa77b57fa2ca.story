Catering to its ultra-skinny customers with a waist size of 23 inches, J. Crew has launched a brand new size: XXXS or 000.

The retailer claims it is targeting smaller-boned customers in Asia, but many have accused J Crew of promoting 'vanity sizing' - where customers are tricked into believing they are wearing a smaller size than usual.

'It promulgates the damaging concept that self-worth is directly proportional to clothing-tag size,' wrote Capital Hill Style, adding that it 'negatively effects girls’ feelings about their bodies'.

But J. Crew, which has an online sizing chart that lists a range of sizes, from size 16 to petites and tall, as well as special swim sizes for long and short torsos, claims it is 'simply addressing the demand coming from Asia for smaller sizes'.

'Our sizes typically run big and the Asia market tends to run small,' a J. Crew spokeswoman told Today.

'To further put into perspective, these sizes add up to the smallest possible percentage of our overall sizing assortment.'

According to Grazia, however, the trend around size 000 has become a dangerous obsession with extreme slimness.

‘Right now it’s in to be thin in Hollywood. It’s not about size zero 
anymore. These days, double-zero sizes don’t cut it either. Size triple 
zero is the number-one goal here,' the London magazine reports.

‘Although there are 
thankfully curvier role models out there, from Kim Kardashian to 
Beyoncé, it’s a cut-throat industry and it’s no secret that stars can 
make headlines out of being scarily skinny,’ it added.

Model Alexa Chung often posts snaps on her various social media accounts showing her stick thin legs and child like proportions

Nicole Ritchie, who first sparked concern over her size zero physique in 2006, is looking thinner than ever

Models,
 It girls and actresses are all jumping on board this new bandwagon, 
with Nicole Ritchie, who first sparked concern over size zero in 2006, 
looking thinner than ever.

Alexa
 Chung and Mary Charteris and actresses Kate Bosworth and Modern 
Family's Julie Bowen are also among those sporting pencil-thin legs and sharp collarbones.

The
 23-inch waist that size triple zero demands is a healthy waist 
measurement for a six-to-eight year old girl, and though most UK brands 
don’t carry adult clothes in such a tiny size, it is available from many
 American brands sold on our high streets.

'While 
stars might be following this potentially dangerous trend hoping to grab
 attention in the press, young women are in turn copying them, spurred 
on by the ultra-thin photos these celebrities share on social media.

A-list
 trainer James Duigan says: 'The selfie craze in particular has 
intensified this, and celebrities know that if they post a picture of 
themselves looking skinny, with ribs on show, they’ll get attention.'but
 it isn’t always real – sometimes they’re breathing in and sometimes  
the angle makes them look thinner than they really are.

Model and It girl Mary Chateris regularly shows her incredibly thin body off on her social media accounts

‘Their
 weight struggles become their story. When you lose weight too quickly 
or too severely, it just doesn’t work. The public may look at these and 
see thinness, but they don’t see the injury, pain and hunger.’

Grazia
 Editor-in-Chief Jane Bruton says: 'For a while it seemed the size zero 
phenomenon was over after the likes of Beyonce, Rihanna and Daisy Lowe 
became body role models.

'But
 while these women are still celebrated, there appears to be a 
disturbing return in Hollywood to the worryingly thin frames we saw 
eight years ago when Grazia first reported on Size 00. In fact, it's 
gone even further with the introduction of American Size 000.'

Actresses Kate Bosworth and Julie Bowen have both shrunk dramatically since the start of their careers

Expert warn that while star may shrink down to size Triple Zero to grab headlines, their regular social medial updates means women everywhere try and emulate the look

'Some experts are blaming this on the proliferation of social media, in particular the rise of the "selfie", which can be argued promotes an unrealistic body image through "flattering" angles and filters.

'It has recently come to light that there are now even apps to slim your own online photographs.

Social media used to be a "body real" environment but now many of the images are distorted and unrealistic.'

'The other factor is the confusion that exists over sizing, so-called "vanity sizing".

A size 10 can vary by two inches or more between high street retailers, and there's increasing confusion over size ranges which can be anything from a 1 to a 4, an XXS to an XXXL or a 000 to an 18, plus European sizes on top.

'A 38 is a British size 10 in France but a size 6 in Italy. There needs to be standardisation.'

'When size is the benchmark for self-worth, these extreme negative sizes are leading to women aspiring to be a shape that could be dangerously unhealthy for their frame.' The full feature The Disturbing Rise of the Triple Zero and images appeared in Grazia published on Tuesday 24 June 2014.  Also available as a digital edition and at www.graziadaily.co.uk
