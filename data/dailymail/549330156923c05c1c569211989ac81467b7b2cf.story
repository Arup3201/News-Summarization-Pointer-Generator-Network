A 19-year-old who brutally beat up a 70-year-old man in Portland, Oregon while high on drugs refused to apologize to the victim today as he was sentenced to five years in prison.

Daniel Dorson, then 18, smashed his skateboard over Larry Allen's head when the senior citizen asked him and a group of street youth to move away from the Portland Outdoor Store, where he has worked for the past 30 years.

Public defender Chris Howard made a deal with prosecutor Chris Mascal, agreeing that if Dorson plead guilty to attempted second-degree assault, he would get a five-year sentence with the possibility of early release.

Not sorry: Daniel Dorson, 19, refused to apologize for beating a 70-year-old man as he was sentenced to five years in prison in connection to the July attack today

Beaten and bruised: Larry Allen had to take three weeks off work following the attack, which left him with a huge gash on his head, several scratches and cuts on his arm and lasting health problems

This was a preferable sentence to the mandatory five-year and 10-month sentence Dorson would have received if convicted of second-degree assault.

But the plea deal was almost pulled when Dorson refused to apologize to Allen in court today.

'What I'm guilty of is defending my own. That's it. That's all I have to say. I was defending my own,' Dorson said.

That wasn't good enough for Mascal.

'I'm not satisfied by the so-called apology,' Mascal told the judge. 'I think it falls short...I think (the victim) is owed a little bit more.'

The judge then cleared the court so Howard could speak to his client, but by the time the break was over Dorson still refused to apologize.

In the end, Mascal decided to go through with the plea deal anyway 'for the good of the case'.

After the hearing, Allen spoke with reporters about seeing his attacker again.

'I recognized him as soon as he walked down the hallway. Kind of nervous being in the same room,' Allen said. 'Just apologize for hitting an old man. There was no need for it.'

Allen went out to spray the sidewalks on July 15 when he encountered Dorson with a pack of street youth.

Just trying to do his job: Allen was trying to spray the sidewalks outside the Portland Outdoor Store, where he has worked for 30 years, on July 15 when a pack of street youth refused move

He asked the group to move so he could clean the walkway, but when they refused they got into an argument.

Dorson says that Allen pushed his girlfriend, which Allen denies. He also claims he was high on drugs and hadn't slept for a few days.

Either way, Dorson took his skate board and bashed it over Allen's head, causing the senior citizen to gush blood.

A co-worker said Allen passed out for approximately 20 seconds. He also sustained several scratches and cuts on his arm.

Allen had to take three weeks off work following the attack and says he's still dealing with the after effects.

'I am not breathing quite as well as I was,' Allen said. 'I'm getting weaker.'

Allen spoke with reporters after Tuesday's hearing, saying he was confused why Dorson wouldn't just say sorry

By the time police arrived on the scene the pack of kids were gone.

It wasn't until three months later that authorities tracked Dorson down to northern California where he was arrested for second-degree assault.

Initially, Dorson claimed he didn't know anything about the attack but then changed his story to say someone else carried it out.

Eventually he admitted being the perpetrator, but said he was just trying to protect his girlfriend.

During his court appearances, more details emerged about Dorson's childhood and how he ended up on the street.

His public defender said he was put in the foster care system as an infant but eventually taken in by his grandmother when he was three.

Home life turned bad when a man moved in with them when Dorson was 7, and the drug user beat him up with hangers and brooms.

Eventually his grandmother put him back in the foster care system when he was 11, and he became a runaway at 14.

That's around the time he found a group of street youth who 'accepted him for who he was'.

Allen is back working five days a week at the outdoor store, but says he doesn't spray the sidewalks anymore.
