Every snowflake is unique, yet their lack of visibility to the naked eye means we are often unable to appreciate their beauty.

Undeterred, a cunning photographer has developed a unique way of circumventing this problem - developing his own DIY close-up photography kit.

Russian photographer Alexey Kljatov takes these incredibly detailed photographs using a basic camera, with a magnification device taped to the lens.

He captures most of the snowflakes on the rudimentary studio on his balcony - comprising a sheet of glass balancing on the legs of an upturned stool.

Mr Kljatov, from Moscow, often points an LED torch at the glass from underneath to provide lighting.

Some of the darker images have been captured using natural light and woolen fabric placed underneath the glass.

Given that he once used a plastic bottle to steady his camera, with pictures taken in the camera's macro mode, his new setup looks sophisticated.

But it simply entails a lens taken from an antiquated USSR Zenit SLR camera strapped to his camera and the aforementioned aids.
