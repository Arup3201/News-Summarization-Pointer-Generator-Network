We don't know of they were hidden by the Wicked Witch or just lost somewhere over the rainbow, but a pair of incredibly rare paintings used to plan the filming of timeless movie The Wizard of Oz have emerged for sale - 75 years after its release.

The watercolours came from the brush of famed art director Jack Martin Smith and showed how the sets might look once filming of the Hollywood classic began.

One of the paintings features Dorothy - who was  played by child star Judy Garland - and two Munchkins walking down the Yellow Brick Road to Oz while the other shows Dorothy with the Scarecrow.

The second shows Dorothy on the Yellow Brick Road. Both are expected to sell for more than $6,500

Smith produced the 25ins by 18ins artworks so the film's crew could see how characters, costumes and sets would look during the revered 1939 musical.

It is thought that after filming was over, the studio - Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer - sold off the paintings. Little is known about where they were until they surfaced at an estate sale in the late 1980s.

The current owner instantly recognised the two paintings as scenes from The Wizard of Oz and snapped them up for a small sum of money.

She has kept them preserved for the past 25 years but has now decided the time is right to sell them.

Jack Martin Smith was the lead artist and at the time would have just created these artworks very quickly, but he was exceptionally skilled and they are now viewed as art in their own right

Each painting is tipped to fetch around $6,700 when they go under the hammer at Heritage Auctions in Beverly Hills, California.

Margaret Barrett, head of entertainment, said: 'Before filming started, the production crew's art team painted quick, off-the-cuff paintings of scenes which were then shown to the art director.

'He would then be able to plan how scenes were going to look before filming began.

'He went on to become one of the most famous art directors in Hollywood.

'When filming ended they were sold by the film studio. A woman then bought them at an estate sale 25 years ago, not as an investment but because she liked them. 

'The Wizard of Oz is a beloved all-time classic and there is very high demand for memorabilia from the film.

'These two paintings are very special and are attracting interest from all over the world.'

The Wizard of Oz was based on L. Frank Baum's 1900 book The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.

It is one of the best-loved films of all time, but on its release it was a commercial failure, making only $200,000  profit.

It was nominated for six Oscars but lost out to Gone with the Wind.

It was only when it started being shown on television in the mid 50s that people fell in love with it.

The auction will take place on August 23.
