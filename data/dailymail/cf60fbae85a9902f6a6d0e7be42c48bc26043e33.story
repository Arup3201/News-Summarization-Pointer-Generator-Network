Turkey has warned of reprisals after it accused the Syrian government of being linked to two car bombs that killed 46 people.

The explosions in the Turkish border town of Reyhanli, are the deadliest in Turkey since the start of Syria’s bloody civil war.

They left the town of 60,000 people devastated, damaging more than 850 buildings and leaving a further 50 people in hospital.

Turkish deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc pointed the finger of blame at the Syrian regime of President Bashar Assad.

The death toll so far from the explosions stands at 43, while at least 100 were injured, many of them seriously

Turkey has blamed pro-Damascus groups for the tragedy and is vowing to bring the perpetrators to justice

Syria has angrily rejected the accusations of its neighbours and insists its government was not behind the attacks

The violent and deadly force of the explosions is clear and rescuers confront the enormity of the clean-up task

He said: ‘With their secret services and armed groups, they are certainly one of the usual suspects to instigate and carry out such an outrageous plot.’

Turkey, a Nato member, is a strong supporter of the opposition and has hosted its leaders, rebel commanders and thousands of refugees.

Syria has accused the Turkish government of facilitating the flow of arms, explosives, vehicles, fighters and money to rebels across the border.

And the bombings on Saturday have raised fears that Turkey is being pulled deeper into the uprising against Syria’s President Bashar Assad.

Britain, the United States and Nato have all pledged to support Turkey in the dispute with Syria.

Foreign secretary, William Hague, said yesterday: ‘We stand with the people of Turkey.’

The first bomb exploded outside the town hall on Saturday, the second detonated 15 minutes later beside a post office.

Turkish foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu today said he believed fighters loyal to Syrian President Assad were responsible.

He spoke after the arrest of nine 
Turkish citizens in connection to the bombings, they are believed to 
have links with the Syrian intelligence Agency.

Mr Davutoglu said: ‘No-one should attempt to test Turkey’s power. Our security forces will take all necessary measures.’

He also warned Syria against trying to 
drive a wedge between Turkey and the thousands of refugees who had 
arrived since the violence erupted in March 2011.

After the explosions, Turks vented their anger by vandalising cars with Syrian number plates and attacking some refugees.

Police had to fire weapons into the air to help restore order.

Mr Davutoglu said the attacks ‘have 
nothing to do with the Syrian refugees in Turkey, it’s got everything to
do with the Syrian regime.’

He said it was time for the 
international community to take action against Syria, with the security 
risks in Turkey and Syria’s other neighbours mounting.

There has been an escalation in tension on the border for some months

Syria's regime is being blamed after several explosions killed at least 40 people and injured dozens in Reyhanli, near Turkey's border with the war-torn country

In Damascus, the Syrian Information Minister Omran al-Zoubi yesterday denied the Assad regime was behind the attacks.

He said Syria ‘did not commit and would never commit such an act because our values would not allow it.’

Instead he claimed it was the Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his party that were responsible for the atrocity.

Mr Zoubi demanded that Mr Erdogan ‘step down as a killer and as a butcher’.

Mr Erdogan is due to meet President 
Barack Obama in Washington on Thursday at a time when the United States 
is considering its position on Syria.

The main opposition Syrian National Coalition said the attacks were a failed attempt to 'destroy the brotherhood' between Syrians and Turks

The US secretary of state, John Kerry, said: ‘The United States condemns [the] car bombings and we stand with our ally, Turkey.

‘This awful news strikes an especially personal note for all of us given how closely we work in partnership with Turkey.’

The United States has provided humanitarian aid to the Syrian opposition, but has been reluctant to provide military aid.

That’s in part because al-Qaida-linked militants are becoming increasingly influential in the armed opposition.

The blasts took place right on the Syrian border in the town of Reyhanli

Last week, Mr Erdogan alleged that Syria
has been using chemical weapons, delivering them on at least 200 
missiles, though he provided no evidence.

Syria has denied using chemical weapons.

Mr Obama has said the use of chemicals 
by the regime is a ‘red line’ that would have harsh consequences, but 
has said he needs more time to investigate allegations.

The car bombing is the third time the Syrian conflict has spilled over the border into Turkey.
