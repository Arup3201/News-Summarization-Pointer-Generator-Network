They’re the upmarket vegetables that we order from a menu but for many of us they’re too intimidating to cook at home.

Celeriac, artichokes and sweet potatoes are counted among the sides that people like to order at a restaurant but are clueless when it comes to preparing them in our own kitchens.

Research by Marks & Spencer found that almost three quarters of customers buy and cook more vegetables than they did in the past, and are trying branching out in their vegetable choices.

And a sizeable 57% said they now consider interesting vegetables to be a meal in their own right, rather than just an accompaniment to a meat dish.

But research has found that while we may be keen to try more adventurous vegetables, we don’t know how to prepare or cook for ourselves.

The survey found that 35% of customers would use exotic vegetables such as pak choi, okra and beetroot at home if they were pre-prepared and ready for cooking.

Customers classified these vegetables as ‘difficult to cook’ as opposed to broccoli, carrots and mushrooms, which were described as easy to cook but ‘boring’.

But now supermarkets are responding to the British desire to push the culinary boundaries.

Marks & Spencer has launched the UK’s first miniature sweet potato, ‘Glorious Sunshine’ as a result of finding that customers were unsure how to cook and prepare normal bulbous sweet potatoes.

The baby sweet potatoes are a third of the size of their traditional counterparts and are more tender and cook much faster.

M&S Vegetable Buyer, Louisa Read, said: ‘After seeing the research that our customers found sweet potatoes one of the most difficult vegetables to prepare and cook we wanted to offer something that reduced the hassle.

‘Both delicious and nutrient-packed these baby versions can be roasted whole. And with more fibre, less calories and less carbs they are a healthy and delicious alternative to white potatoes.’

Last month Waitrose announced the launch of baby avocadoes in its ‘Essentials’ range, which join the ranks of baby carrots, baby corn and baby asparagus as the pint-sized plants in supermarket aisles.

The demand for a wider variety of vegetables in supermarkets comes as many people choose to move away from a carnivorous diet to a plant-based one, as well as the craze for ‘superfoods’ – foods which contain high levels of vitamins and minerals.

Out of the 3,000 people surveyed, almost half said they are trying to eat less meat, and a quarter (23 per cent) are trying to replace meat with more beans, lentils and pulses.
