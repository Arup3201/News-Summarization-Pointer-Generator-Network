Warning: David Ruffley said the European elections in May 2014 could be spark a leadership challenge

David Cameron has just 12 months to prove himself or risk losing the support of Tory MPs, a senior backbencher has claimed.

In a coded warning that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge next spring, David Ruffley warned the European elections in May 2014 could be a ‘flashpoint’.

Mr Ruffley, the former shadow police minister, warned that losing to UKIP in the Euro elections would cause up to 100 MPs in marginal seats to lose faith in Mr Cameron.

And in a second challenge to Mr 
Cameron, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage revealed that he is 
in talks with up to 20 Tory MPs about joining forces at the next 
election.

Mr Farage also revealed that at least one Conservative MP has used a go-between to discuss defecting to UKIP.

The
UKIP leader said he was ‘in talks all over the place’ with ‘about 20’ 
Tory MPs about standing on a joint ticket, and with Tory councillors who
want to defect.

And Mr Ruffley warned that the Prime 
Minister’s strategy to hold a referendum on Europe in 2017 may not be 
tough enough to win over voters who are defecting from the Tories to 
UKIP.

He said: ‘I think 
David Cameron has got 12 months to show that his strategy works. I think
we should give him time to see if that works but next May could be a 
flashpoint.’

Get it right: David Cameron has been warned that he must address the issue of Nigel Farage in the next year

‘I think next May’s euro elections 
might put pressure on him to go harder because there is a lot of 
speculation in and around Downing Street that UKIP might come first.

'If that happens there’ll be 12 months before the election and some of our colleagues in marginal seats might get a bit windy.’

Mr Ruffley said that a strong showing by UKIP at the 2015 general election would cost Tories seats.

He also archly described Mr Cameron as ‘the best prime minister we’ve got’ a backhanded compliment that echoes what former Tory statesman Rab Butler said of his bitter rival Harold Macmillan.

Mr Ruffley has broken cover in public to voice thoughts shared by many Tory MPs in private.

Up to 20 are said to be prepared to 
demand a vote of confidence in Mr Cameron, with 46 required to write to 
the 1922 Committee to force an election.

Mr Cameron has also come under fire 
from backbencher Douglas Carswell, who accused ministers of allowing 
civil servants to take over the Government.

He said: ‘I think we need to actually 
take on the Mandarinate, who all too often seem to be really running 
this government, and that is the fundamental problem.’

But Mr Carswell dismissed pressure for a leadership election, saying: ‘It would be extraordinarily disruptive.’ 

However,
up to four groups of MPs are said to be plotting about Mr Cameron’s 
future.

Allies of backbencher Adam Afriyie are urging him to make fresh 
interventions to burnish his own leadership credentials.
