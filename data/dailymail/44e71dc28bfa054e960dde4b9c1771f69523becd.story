A mother and her young daughter were left terrified after a charging rhino smashed into their car during a family day trip to a safari park.

Vicky Liggins, 26, was driving through West Midlands Safari Park, in Worcestershire, with her 19-month-old daughter Evelyn and sister Beth Rees when the incident occurred.

She said the Asian rhino, which weighs about the same as a car at two tonnes, charged at her Mitsubishi Warrior and shunted it with such force that the back wheels lifted off the ground.

The animal caused £500 worth of damage to her car including scratches and damage to the rear panels, a broken back light and dents. She said the trio were left 'absolutely petrified' by the incident at the safari park

The bank worker, from Dudley, West Midlands, said the trio were left 'absolutely petrified' by the ordeal and said the large animal had caused more than £500 worth of damage to her car.

She said: 'I dread to think what would've happened if we'd been in a smaller, lighter vehicle.

'As we drove past the three rhinos, I thought they were too close.

'These animals are two tons - they weigh more than a car; they're dangerous.

'I didn't notice the rhino behind my car until it hit the vehicle with its horn.

'We were all really frightened. It then shunted us from behind with such force that the back wheel lifted off the ground.

'We were absolutely petrified. I thought the rhino was going to pierce the back panel and smash through the rear windscreen.

'We couldn't drive away because of the rhinos in front.

'My daughter was in tears and the sad thing is that she loves animals.'

Ms Liggins said a range worker eventually came to their aid and helped move the rhinos from the scene.

However, her car was left with a smashed back light, a crumpled rear and dents to the driver's side.

The bank worker has criticised West Midlands Safari Park for not issuing an immediate apology and said the park should install barriers to stop damage to cars (right). She said her daughter (left) had been left terrified

West Midlands Safari Park gave Ms Liggins a £250 goodwill voucher following the incident and apologised

She is now calling for barriers to be installed at the safari park to prevent the rhinos wandering in front of vehicles.

She said: 'It was one very scary and expensive day.

'As a member of the public you don't expect to be hit by a massive animal like that.

'I want the public to understand the dangers of safari parks. Even with so called "rangers" on site, it isn't safe.'

The mother also criticised the way managers at the park handled the attack, which happened three weeks ago.

'I received no immediate apology and was referred to the "terms and conditions",' she said.

The family were driving through an area where three rhinos were living when one of them charged at the car

West Midlands Safari Park apologised for the incident and handed Ms Liggins a goodwill voucher of £250.

A spokesman added: 'The highlight of a visit to West Midland Safari Park is to drive amongst free-roaming animals and to get the chance to feed some of them. 

'In addition, we also offer a guided minibus tour for a small extra charge.

'We welcome many, many thousands of visitors during the course of a year without mishap and, therefore, we are very sorry that wasn't so on this particular occasion'. 

The safari park, which describes itself as the 'best tourist attraction in the West Midlands', has more than 180 species of animals in its four-mile drive-through safari.
