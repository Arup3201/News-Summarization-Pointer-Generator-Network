Surveillance cameras captured the moment every door at a maximum-security jail wing in Florida swung open and released a flock of violent criminals, who ganged up and attacked another inmate with vicious homemade knives.

The inmate was forced to jump over a railing and fall one story to escape his assailants, who are believed to be members of a rival gang in the Miami neighborhood of Liberty City.

The Miami-Dade Corrections Department says it still doesn't know why the security system unlocked and opened every door in the maximum-security wing of the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center on June 14.

However, two inmates immediately crept out of their cells - seemingly moving with purpose - as soon as the doors slid open.

Open sesame: Two inmates crept out of their cells the moment the doors slid open - leading to speculation that they knew they would be released

Target: The men ganged up to attack Kenneth Williams, left, who is the leader of a rival gang. The men were allegedly armed with homemade prison shivs

The Miami Herald reports that this has led some to speculate that the prisoners knew that their doors would open and that they were waiting to be let out to execute their attack.

The Herald obtained a copy of the June 14 surveillance video.

It shows an attack on Kenneth Williams, believed to be a leader of the New Moneii gang that deals drugs in a Liberty City public housing project, by three rival gang members - all of whom were allegedly armed with shivs - crude prison knives.

Williams jumped over a railing and landed on the floor below to escape his assailants. He can be seen writhing in pain, holding his leg.

Doctors later said he suffered a fractured vertebrae and a broken ankle.

Williams was awaiting trial on charges he tried to intimidate witnesses testifying against two gunmen accused of killing one of Williams' rivals and his 10-month-old son.

The Herald reports that police suspect Williams ordered the hit, but have been unable to produce evidence to charge him.

The beleaguered Maimi-Dade Corrections Department said it is still working to figure out why the doors in the maximum security wing opened. 

Inmates in that wing are never let out of their cells more than a few at a time and are never allowed to mingle in common areas together.

In May, a similar incident allowed the computerized control panel to open all doors on the wing when a guard accidentally pushed the wrong button. 

After that happened, a safety was installed that forced jailers who pressed the button to open all doors to confirm the selection first.

Still the Corrections Department claims that no jailer released the doors.

Williams' lawyer questions that conclusion.
