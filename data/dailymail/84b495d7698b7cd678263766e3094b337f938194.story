A candle lit as part of the nationwide First World War centenary vigil sparked a flat fire forcing a man to jump from a first-floor window.

The candle is believed to have set fire to a curtain in the flat in Cambridge, just after midnight on Monday night.

The man, in his 30s, fell 12ft as he scrambled to escape the blaze, and neighbours called emergency services.

The windows of his flat and his neighbour's below were blown out, the rooms severely damaged by smoke and the fire burnt through the electrics - making them uninhabitable.

Brian Foskett, 74, was sleeping in his flat below the fire until firefighters smashed his door down.

The former jazz drummer said: 'I could hear this 'bang bang' and I thought 'hello hello' and I thought I must be in a bit of difficulty here with burglars.

'All of a sudden these firefighters were in my flat with their yellow helmets on and I'm there starkers.

'I was freaking out saying 'what are you doing here?' and they said I'd better get out. It was a bit of fright.'

He was strapped to a spinal board as a precaution but escaped with minor injuries.

Mr Foskett said he spoke to his neighbour as he lay injured and added: 'He told me he lit a candle to mark the anniversary of the First World War and that's how it started.'

Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service said: 'Following a fire investigation, the most likely cause of the fire was accidental.

'It is believed a candle was lit on a windowsill and spread to curtains, which then developed and spread through the property.'
