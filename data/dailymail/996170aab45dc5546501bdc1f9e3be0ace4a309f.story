Tens of thousands of people packed out a memorial ceremony today for the victims of the Russian plane crash that has devastated a top ice hockey team.

Mourners including Prime Minister Vladimir Putin filled the team's stadium in Yaroslavl to lay flowers near the coffins of players and staff from the Lokomotiv Yaroslavl team.

The crash of a chartered Yak-42 jet on Wednesday killed 43 people and was one of the sports world's worst aviation disasters, shocking Russia and the international ice hockey community.

Of the 45 people on board, 36 were Lokomotiv players, coaches and team officials, including many European and former NHL players.

Portraits of the players were placed on chairs in front of each of the coffins as mourners walked past and laid flowers.

Emotions were especially raw in Yaroslavl, where the team's consistently strong performance in the Kontinental Hockey League was a source of great pride.

The experts have come to no conclusions yet about the cause of the crash.

Mystery: A Yak-42 similar to the one carrying the players. Investigations have revealed all three engines were working and there was no contaminated fuel

Authorities checked fuel supplies at the Tunoshna airport amid suspicions that low quality fuel could be to blame, but Russia's top aviation authority said today that data recorders gave no indication that bad fuel was the cause.

Two men survived the crash - player Alexander Galimov and crew member Alexander Sizov - and both remain in a critical condition in medicated comas after they were transferred to Moscow for treatment.

Hospital officials said Galimov had burns over 90 per cent of his body.
