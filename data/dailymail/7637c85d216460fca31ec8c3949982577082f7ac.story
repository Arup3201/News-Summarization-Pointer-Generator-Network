Manchester United fans will be hoping Robin van Persie is
smiling through all of this season - and he certainly hasn't got off to a bad
start.

The Dutch hitman posted a snap to his Instagram account of
him and wife Bouchra, who did a Gareth Bale-style heart for the camera.

Van Persie will link up with his World Cup manager Louis van
Gaal when he returns to United's pre-season training.

And one Old Trafford icon believes the new manager will hand
his compatriot the captain's armband.

Paul Scholes has earmarked Van Perise's fellow striker
Rooney for the role, but believes Van Gaal will stick with Van Persie.

He said: 'I think he [Van Gaal] will give it [the
captaincy] to Robin [Van Persie]. He’s had a lot of experience with him from
Holland. He knows him well, knows him as a player, but personally I would
probably go for Rooney.

'He’s always struck me as the type who could be a captain
and now is the perfect time to give him the responsibility I know he is capable
of taking. And the same goes for England. With both teams, there is not an
outstanding candidate for the role.'

Prediction: Paul Scholes believes Van Persie will be handed the captain's armband ahead of Wayne Rooney
