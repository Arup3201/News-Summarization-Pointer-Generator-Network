The billionaire founder of Megaupload.com, which allowed users to swap large files across the internet before it was shut down on the orders of the FBI, said U.S. Vice President Joe Biden ordered the ultimately illegal raids on the company.

Kim DotCom, speaking to the website TorrentFreak, which follows the popular but legally-murky world of file sharing, said he believed Biden told attorney Neil MacBride to target the site.

Citing evidence on the White House website, DotCom says that in one meeting, Biden met with the head of the Motion Picture Association of America, which crusades against movie piracy, 'all studio bosses', and an extradition expert.

He alleged this meeting was to plot his arrest and to arrange Megaupload's demise.

Seventy officers raided the New 
Zealand mansion of Dotcom - also known as Kim 
Schmitz - in January as part of an investigation of his website 
spearheaded by the FBI in the U.S.

DotCom was one of four men arrested during the operation, accused of being the ringleader of a group that 
netted $175million since 2005 by copying and distributing music, films 
and other copyrighted content without authorisation.

Dotcom's lawyers say the company simply offered online storage.

Many observers expressed surprise at the speed with which the US government acted against DotCom.

But DotCom gave a potential explanation: 'I do know from a credible source that it was Joe Biden, the best 
friend of former Senator and Motion Picture Association of America 
(MPAA) boss Chris Dodd, who ordered his former lawyer and now state 
attorney Neil MacBride to take Mega down.

'After we received information from an insider we scanned the White 
House visitor logs for all meetings of Chris Dodd and studio bosses with
Joe Biden and Obama. They are publicly available on the White House 
website.

'It is interesting that a man by the name of Mike Ellis of MPA Asia,
an extradition expert and former superintendent of the Hong Kong 
police, was also at a meeting with Dodd, all studio bosses and Joe 
Biden.

'The same Mike Ellis met with the Minister of Justice Simon Power 
in New Zealand.'

Last week a New Zealand judge found 
the warrants used in the seizure of property from Dotcom's mansion near 
Auckland were illegal.

Justice
Helen Winkelmann ruled that moves by the FBI to copy data from Dotcom's
computer and take it offshore were also unlawful.

Torrent Freak added: 'The information above does indeed suggest that the Megaupload case was discussed at the highest political levels last year.

'Noteworthy is also the MPAA’s lobbying disclosure statement of last year which includes money spent on lobbying the office of Vice President Joe Biden.

'What exactly Biden’s role has been, and whether that’s problematic, remains to be seen. However, Dotcom is convinced that corrupt elements in the U.S. Government brought Mega down. More on this will be made public in the near future.'

Dotcom said he had more evidence about the investigation, and added: 'At the appropriate time we will release what we know. The whole Mega case is quite the political thriller.'

Big operation: Seventy police raided Dotcom's mansion near Auckland in January

Dotcom
is on bail in New Zealand, fighting attempts by U.S. authorities 
seeking to extradite him on charges of copyright theft and money 
laundering. An extradition hearing is set for August.

During
the January raid, armed officers, backed by helicopters, cut Dotcom out
of a safe room he had barricaded himself in within the sprawling 
country estate, reputedly New Zealand's most expensive home.

Millions of dollars in assets were seized or frozen, including almost 20 luxury vehicles, dozens of computers and art works.

Before
it was shut down in January, Megaupload was one of the world's most 
popular websites, where millions of users stored data, either for free 
or by paying for premium service.

Authorities say Megaupload.com and related sites cheated copyright holders out of more than $500million.

U.S.
lawyers for Megaupload have also argued that American federal 
authorities cannot charge the company with criminal behaviour because it
is Hong Kong-based, and also that no papers have ever been formally 
served.

The company hosting the frozen data of millions of users of the file 
sharing site said their bill must be paid or they be allowed to delete 
the data.

Carpathia Hosting said it is using more than 1,100 servers to store the 25million gigabytes of the website's data - it has been  inaccessible since the site was seized by the FBI.

The
company filed an emergency motion in a U.S. federal court in Virginia 
seeking protection from the expense of hosting the data of up to 
66million users.

The
Virginia-based company said it is paying $9,000 (£5,700) a day to host 
the data, which works out to more than $500,000 (£316,600) since 
January.
