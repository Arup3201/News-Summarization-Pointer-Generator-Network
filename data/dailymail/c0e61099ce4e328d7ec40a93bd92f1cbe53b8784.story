Islamic State fighters have  beheaded a group of soldiers captured during a night time offensive on a military airbase, while a new propaganda video purports to show the jihadis shooting down a fighter jet during a skirmish with Syrian forces.

Islamic State (ISIS) fighters carried out a night time attack on an airbase near the Syrian city of Deir ez-Zor, capturing several Assad soldiers and beheading them while photographing the event and posting the images online.

It comes amid the release of yet another ISIS propaganda video, purporting to show the militants shooting down a fighter jet using an anti-aircraft gun.

This photo appears to show a captured fighter being forced to send a final message to retreating comrades

Following the attack on the military airport, ISIS militants rounded up a number of Syrian army prisoners. Photos have emerged showing one of the fighters begging for his life.

Still wearing his camouflage fatigues, the fighter appears to be crying as several ISIS fighters surround him. One of the fighters wearing a pair of leather gloves can be seen holding the terrified prisoner down by the collar of his neck. 

A second photo shows a close-up shot of the captured soldier from the Assad regime. The shiny, curved blade of a knife can be seen in the hands of a fighter, standing behind the prisoner of war.

It appears he might have been forced to radio a final message to his retreating comrades as one photo shows an ISIS fighter holding a small radio next to the prisoner's mouth.

Another photo of the prisoner shows him being beheaded. An ISIS fighter, wearing a wedding ring and with an orange ribbon attached to his jumper, is pictured holding the prisoner by the hair and cutting his throat.

Local activists in the ISIS controlled city of Deir ez-Zor reported that a suicide bomber blew himself up in a rigged armoured tank near one of the airbase checkpoints, killing 19.

It is thought to be the first time the militants have used a tank for a suicide bombing mission rather than a lorry and a car.

A photo later emerged of the rusty vehicle with large yellow sacks of explosives packed on top and inside the tank. Its armoured structure also appears to have been reinforced with additional armour.

The dead suicide bomber was later revealed to be a Libyan fighter, known as Abu Hathitha al-Libi. 

Photographs reveal bodies lying by tables and their beds. There is even a photo of an empty bottle on the ground, once possibly containing the strong aniseed drink, arak.

ISIS also released photos show high grade military equipment (pictured) being looted from the airbase

The militants also showed off some of the military equipment which they found at the airbase. Anti-tank guided missiles can be seen along with other high value military items.

Meanwhile, a new ISIS propaganda video was released last night, showcasing the militant group’s recapture of Syria’s most important gas fields and purporting to show them downing a fighter jet.

The Sha’er gas fields, located in the eastern province of Homs, had been controlled by the Assad regime but the video suggests a surprise attack meant that the fighters easily overpowered the Syrian Arab Army (SAA).

Finally, it show ISIS fighters inspecting some smoking wreckage purported to be that of the jet

The video shows one of the jets, belonging to the Assad regime, opening fire on the militants. Anti-aircraft guns start to open fire on the jet and the fighters begin to panic.

The alleged burnt out wreckage of the jet, still smouldering on the desert earth, is later found.

The propaganda video begins with a convoy of pickup trucks, filled with ISIS militants, being driven down a single tarmacked road at dawn. Anti-aircraft gun placements are positioned on the back of each truck.

A tank is shown slowly driving through the arid desert whilst heavy artillery pieces are being positioned behind mounts of earth. An ISIS fighter wearing a red and white chequered scarf, begins to crank up the cannon, taking aim at the unseen enemy.

The video continues without any soundtrack, just the sound of militants gear clinking against their bodies. A dozen ground troops, carrying an array of rocket propelled grenades and AK 47s, begin to walk in a loose formation towards the hilltop. They crouch down flat in the desert scrubland.

The attack is launched after a heavy artillery barrage, whilst the video accompanies the opening cannon shot with a boisterous soundtrack, calling for jihad and the formation of Islamic State. The ground troops are shown advancing, firing off a few rounds but appearing to take no casualties despite coming under fire. The footage cuts between footage of machine gun fire and troops advancing, followed by very graphic close up shots of several dead SAA soldiers.

Thick smoke can be seen billowing from the stations at the gas fields as a fighter launches another RPG. Only the early stages of the fight are shown, as the film again cuts to the bodies and burnt out tanks which litter the gas station site. Some of the victims appear to be wearing civilian clothes, whilst other soldiers appear to have been burnt beyond recognition. 

The gas fields of al-Shaer have long the battleground on several occasions in the past 18 months, between the SAA and Islamic State. Its decision to attack the gas field comes just days after the group conceded the area to the Assad regime after a two week fight. The latest propaganda video would appear to be an attempt by ISIS to showcase its strength in the eastern countryside.
