Please hold the line: Waiting in telephone queues is ranked among the common of life's bugbears a study has found

IF you’re driven up the wall by being put on hold then you are not alone.

Waiting on a helpline, junk emails and nuisance calls have topped a poll of Britain’s biggest time-wasting ‘bugbears’.

Other irritants include traffic jams, waiting for a replacement bank card or a bus for more than five minutes and slow people in the queue at the till.

The impatience study, produced for Barclays, surveyed 2,000 adults who were asked about their top time-wasting annoyances and most prevalent pet hates.

Almost half of those surveyed said hanging on the phone while waiting for staff at a bank, doctor’s surgery or helpline to give them assistance topped their list of time-wasting bugbears.

Other frustrating time-wasters were identified as having a flight delayed, being stuck at home waiting for a delivery to show up and waiting to be seen at a doctor’s or dentist’s.

More than a third of respondents found waiting for a replacement bank card drove them round the bend, as well as waiting for a repair man and waiting for the tube for more than three minutes.

Friends being late for social engagements was identified as another irritant – with 12 per cent of respondents saying it annoyed them the most.

Cold-callers, being put on hold with ‘soothing’ music and spam emails topped the list of ‘pet hates’. 

Shopping
woes were not far behind with 42 per cent of people saying they were 
frustrated by really slow people in front of them at the till and 40 per
cent of those surveyed were angered by rude shop assistants.

Road rage: Traffic jams were also found to be a constant irritant in the poll, conducted by Barclays

Departure difficulty: Of the 2,000 respondents, many said waiting for delayed flights was one of life's greatest irritants

Tailgaters, stepping in chewing gum and dog poo, as well as people talking loudly on their mobile phones or eating with their mouth open, were also identified as aggravations.

The surveys were done to mark the launch of The Barclays Instant Debit Card service, which aims to make replacement bank cards easily accessible to customers.

Catherine McGrath of Barclays said: ‘It’s little surprise that in today’s fast-paced world, our time comes at an absolute premium. 

‘With the majority of what we want now just a click away, it’s no wonder people are feeling frustrated when having to wait for things such as replacement debit cards, especially when we’re forced to cancel plans at short notice as a result.‘
