A teenager who considered killing herself because online bullies made her life hell has shared her story in the hope it will help other victims.

Amy Louise Paul, from Peterborough, features in a new video for counselling service Childline who helped her through her ordeal.

She said: 'When I was 13 I had a disagreement with one of my friends at school and I thought it was all sorted. Then one of my other friends said "she's made a Facebook group about you for all the people who wish I was dead already."'

Amy Louise aged 13 with her mother, Lisa: They have both praised Childline for their support after she was a victim of online bullies

She added: 'The website was shared and sent out to people to join the group and as far as I'm aware many people did.'

People joined the Facebook group and left cruel comments about the teenager.

Amy Louise said the impact of the bullying affected her happiness and wellbeing.

'Before the cyber-bullying started I was happy but afterwards I didn't want to talk to anyone or be around anyone and I even cut myself off from my family, she said.

Online abuse: The teenager felt suicidal after a hate group was set up to taunt her on Facebook

'I
used to love school and was always excited to be going in to learn new 
things but I started to dread going. And I couldn't just leave it at 
school because it followed me home. I'd go on the computer and I'd be 
worried that someone would say something about it while I was online.Â  
It invaded everywhere.'

She said it became so upsetting, it made her question her will to live and she even contemplated suicide.

She
recalls: 'I was very upset, words can't describe how upset I was. I 
thought everything had been taken away from me and I didn't know what to
do.

'It made me so I 
didn't want to wake up in the morning. I didn't want to go to school or 
see anybody and it made wanting to carry on living very difficult. At 
one point I did want to take my own life.'

When 
Amy Louise's mother, Lisa, 45, a shop manager, found out about the hate
group set up to target her daughter she was furious but felt helpless 
about what could be done.

Moved on: The student is smiling again now the Facebook group has been taken down and she got the help she needed to overcome her ordeal

In a previous interview with the Daily Mail said said: 'The first I heard about the hate group was when I collected Amy Louise 
after school; she was crying uncontrollably and told me what happened.

'I was absolutely furious that the school knew and had 
not called to tell me what was happening. Then I discovered they had not
punished the girl responsible. I had frequent meetings with 
them but they weren't interested, they didn't take it seriously and I 
think the problem is some governors don't even understand what a 
computer is, let alone cyber-bullying.'

She added: 'The police came 24 hours after I reported what was happening but then never got back to us.

'People sweep it under the carpet but they are playing with children's lives. My daughter was in such a terrible state.'

The bully was made to take the Facebook group down by their headteacher but Amy Louise continued to feel the impact on her confidence and because 'people were still talking about it'.

It was Childline who eventually helped her after she reached out to them via their website.

Lisa said: 'The only people who've been really useful are ChildLine - they have been brilliant and gave us lots of good advice.'

No escape: Age 13, left, Amy Louise felt she had no way to get away from the online bullies but now she's happier, right, age 17 and urging other victims to seek help

Some adults who grew up in a world where there were no mobile phones or social network websites may struggle to comprehend the scale and impact of cyber-bullying.

But NSPCC statistics reveal that 38 per cent of young people have been affected by it. A third have received abusive emails and 24 per cent have received abusive text messages.

It can lead to depression and anxiety, and in some tragic cases, teenagers have taken their own lives because they have felt unable to cope.

The NSPCC offer advice on their website to children and parents on how to deal with cyberbullying including tips on online safely and privacy settings.

Amy Louise urges anyone suffering from cyber-bullying to seek help, either by confiding in their parents or teachers or in Childline like she did.

'Quite simply if I hadn't spoken to Childline I doubt I would still be here today,' she admits.

Now Amy-Louise has finally been able to move on from her ordeal and has even drawn some positives from it.

She said: 'It was a horrible experience but from it I
learnt that I can be strong and not let people get to me. The 
experience made me strive to push myself and I'm off to college now to 
study law, politics and English. I also joined the Air Cadets and play 
in their band at an international level.'
