Their crude camera was smuggled into the camp in sausages and carefully hidden away in a hollowed out dictionary. The precious 8mm film stored in the soles of their home made shoes.

Had they been discovered it would have likely meant a firing squad.

But for a group of daring French World War Two prisoners incarcerated in a German POW camp in 1940, it was a risk worth taking.

Candid camera: Footage taken using the French POWs' secret camera shows prisoners milling around the compound in the Nazis' Oflag 17a camp in Austria

And not only did they use the secret device to film daily life around the Oflag 17a camp in Austria, but they even went so far as to film the digging of a tunnel used for their own great escape.

The 30 minutes of footage they captured entitled Sous Le Manteau (Under The Cloak) now serves as a unique historical record giving a fascinating glimpse into what life was really life in the Nazi-run prison camps.

The incredible story of the French prisoners' secret camera is being celebrated in Paris this week after the only living prisoner who managed to escape the camp and make it back to France celebrated his 100th birthday, theÂ BBC reports.

Lt Jean Cuene-Grandidier was among 5,000 officers marched to Oflag 17a situated close to the Czechoslovakian border following their defeat in the battle of France.

Originally built for German troops it was a sprawling camp composed of 40 barracks and surrounded by two lines of barbed wire with lookout towers and floodlights guarding the perimeter.

Life was bleak and monotonous and with little food many of the prisoners were left on the brink of starvation.

But they refused to allow their spirits to be broken.

Realising that when the German soldiers checked food deliveries they only cut down the middle, the prisoners arranged for camera parts to be brought in smuggled in the ends of sausages.

Once assembled a hollowed out dictionary from the camp library served as the perfect hiding place with the spine of the book opening up like a shutter.

Considering the conditions and the basic equipment the quality of the footage is quite remarkable.

The cameramen would become so bold they even filmed the guards tearing their barracks apart in a surprise search.

But perhaps the most striking footage shows badly malnourished prisoners digging their own escape tunnel.

Lt Cuene-Grandidier who has been presented with France's highest award - the Legion d'honneur, recalled the escape attempt.

He said: 'In the early days we tried digging a number of tunnels from the huts in which we were barracked.

'It was viewed as a form of resistance. We were never punished. The Germans seemed to accept it, though it never worked.

The distances to the wire were too great. And in any case the guards were clever. They always found the tunnels we started. They were looking for the earth we'd removed.'

In total the prisoners of Oflag 17a dug 32 tunnels. Most were discovered by the guards but one attempt did prove successful.

The Germans had permitted the prisoners to build a theatre which they decorated with branches to obscure the view of the guards.

Situated between the barracks and the wire it meant the distance they had to dig was far shorter.

In addition the prisoners had been issued with shovels to dig their own air raid trenches folowing a complaint fromn the International Red Cross.

Using these valuable tools they braved suffocating conditions to burrow 90m underneath the perimeter and on September 17 1943 they were ready to go.

Over two nights, 132 men slipped out into the darkness. They had been provided with civilian clothes and forged papers. Each had been ordered to travel in different directions to reduce the possibility of capture.

Lt Cuene-Grandidier recalled: 'The short length of the tunnel and the number of people inside, meant we had to lie in the foetal position.

'There was so little air. Some of the men fainted. We waited almost 10 hours to go, all the time imagining the worst; the German firing squad that would surely be waiting at the end of the tunnel.'

But getting onto the other side of the perimeter was just the first step and finding themselves deep in enemy territory hundreds of miles from France, the odds were stacked against them.

Of the 132 who broke out, 126 were recaptured within the first week. Only Lt Cuene-Grandidier and one other prisoner managed to return to France.

The story of Lt Cuene-Grandidier's escape sounds like the plot to a Holywood film. After making his way to Vienna, he worked as a hospital nurse treating German soldiers for venereal disease.

After securing a weekend pass to Paris he travelled by train with German officers. His work treating their embarrassing problems must have held him in good stead as one even offered to drive him home in a German army staff car.

But Lt Cuene-Grandidier's loyalty was never in doubt and Within weeks he had joined the Resistance.
