This is the dramatic moment a brave jeweller confronted armed bandits and booted them out of his shop - giving one a kick in the bottom for good measure.

The amazing scenes were caught on a security camera during a hold up in the shop close to Messina in Sicily, the Mafia's island stronghold.

Police are using the footage in an attempt to trace the two armed men who burst into the shop.

Unsuspecting: The seller opens a cloth bag of jewels for a customer as one of the attackers stands outside the door

Break in: The pair make their way in as the shop keeper continues dealing with the customer while on the phone

In the shots, the unidentified owner 
of the store is seen unrolling a cloth bag, containing jewels, with a 
customer standing the other side of the counter.

As they discuss the items a man is buzzed in and his accomplice quickly slips inside.

Within seconds, the first man has pulled a gun out and pointed it at the jeweller.

His partner, who is wearing a helmet, then grabs the cloth bag and puts it inside his rucksack, as the female customer looks on terrified.

The owner disappears into the back of the shop as the customer stands relaxed at the counter with the jewels

The masked man approaches the counter. His accomplice is nowhere to be seen. The owner is still in the back

He reaches over the woman to grab the cloth bag of jewels that was lying open on the counter

But both bandits soon got more than they bargained for as the brave owner turned the tables on them.

Bursting back into the shop from a side room, and holding a gun, he calmly points it at the two men.

The one wearing the helmet gingerly handing back the jewels he has just stolen.

But the unidentified owner returns brandishing a gun. Police believe the attempted robbers carried replicas

He makes his way round the counter, gun in hand, as the customer cowers in a corner and the thieves retreat

The owner then chases both men out of the shop, giving one a kick to the bottom, as he runs after them down the busy Via Umberto in Giardini Naxos, a popular seaside holiday destination for British tourists.

A boy is seen trying to walk out of the shop to see what is going on but he is grabbed by the customer who holds onto him. As she looks out of the doorway, the terrified robbers are seen escaping on a scooter.

Police in Giardini Naxos said no-one was hurt in the raid and no items of jewellery were stolen.

Finally the owner takes a boot to the backside of the attempted robber pushing them out the door

They ruled out Mafia involvement as they investigate who was behind the attempted robbery.

A spokesman added: 'It was a very brave reaction by the shopkeeper - not something we would recommend to anyone else caught up in similar circumstances.

'We have very clear pictures of one man who we are trying to identify and we are looking for his accomplice as well.

'The assumption is that the gun they were using was fake as they handed the jewels back but the gun the jeweller owned was real.'
