Freaky call: The Colorado woman got a missed call from the number, 116666660666

'Freaked out': Jenn Vest was half asleep on Monday night while breast-feeding her son when her phone rang from the number 1-666-666-666 which she says scared her so much she stayed awake all night

‘It really freaked me out because I was half asleep feeding my son and it woke me up.

She said she thought she might have been dreaming at first.

'Then I stayed up the rest of the night praying and hoping nothing would happen,’ Vest told KUSA TV.

The woman said she tried calling the number back, only to get a recorded message saying the number was no longer in service.

Bombardment from hell: Then Vest got 48 text messages in a row from different numbers all with the same message: 'SATAN'

The phone number has been used to prank people in the past, sometimes with threatening messages telling people they were going to die.

'Yesterday I got a phone call and my mom answered it. It said "Ian Folk (my name) has three days to live". Of course my mom has been freaking out all day about it. i pushed last call on my phone and it says the number is 666-666-6666. I try to call it but it isn't a real number. it was pretty creepy,' says one person on a blog.

Another person wrote: 'I just got a call from 666-666-6666 (which was creepy enough). An automated voice that sounded like the old Apple text to speech guy stammered sputnik at me for a bit then called me a f**kstick and told me to press 3 to remove myself from the calling list.'

Vest said she did not know how someone had found her number but said she had recently hung up business flyers and thought that it could stem from them.

According to one comment, there is nothing to be scared of and that it is an automated service people can use at the website, www.ospenterprises.com/phone/.

People who want to play a prank of their friends can do it through that website, according to the comment.

However, the said website was not working at the time this story was published.
