A young seasonal ski worker was found dead today after being sucked into a snow clearing machine in the Pyrenees.

The horrific discovery was made in the early morning in the French resort of Les Angles, which is currently packed with holidaymakers.

Local mayor Michel Poudade said there was 'complete bafflement' as to what happened. 'The driver of the machine is in a terrible state, he is not coping well at all,' Mr Poudade added.

There was speculation that the woman, who was in her early 20s, may have been lying dead in the snow following an unrelated accident, or simply walked out of the driver's range of vision.

A fleet of snow-clearing vehicles had been sent out to clear the roads of the ski resort in the early hours following heavy dumps.

Nobody noticed the woman's body being sucked into the machine. The driver only made the macabre discovery when his plough's engine started to play up.

He immediately called emergency services, but paramedics who arrived on the scene confirmed the woman was dead.

The woman's identity or nationality has not been revealed, with local police saying 'everything is being done to contact her next of kin'.

Heavy vehicles including snow clearing and snow making machines are common in modern ski resorts, but they can often cause extreme danger.

In December, an inquest heard how a British university graduate died in the Austrian Alps when he crashed into a snow machine.

Aleksander Owens-Thurston, 23, of Surrey, was killed in February 2014, just weeks after FI motor racing champion Michael Schumacher was placed into a medically-induced coma following a similar accident.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose urged further safety precautions.

He said: 'This is a tragic matter. These snow making machines are increasingly used, and I suspect this year more than ever, as resorts try and have a full season and cannot afford to lose customers if there is not adequate amounts of snow.

'One finds snow making machines at many modern resorts across Europe. It seems to me that the marking of this snow making machine was probably inadequate.

'Witnesses referred to other resorts where they have bright, luminous tape and certainly a warning.I also note that the pedestal and the machine itself were padded but not the boom.'
