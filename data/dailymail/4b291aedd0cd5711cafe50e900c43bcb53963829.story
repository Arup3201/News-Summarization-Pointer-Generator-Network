Sophie Tolchard, Ellen Falkner and Sian Honnor claimed a commanding victory over Australia to take Commonwealth Games gold in the women's triples at Kelvingrove.

The English trio accelerated into an 11-0 lead after three of 18 ends and led 20-1 after 10 ends before completing a 22-4 victory over Australia's Lynsey Clarke, Karen Murphy and Kelsey Cottrell.

The match came to a conclusion after 15 ends, with Australia conceding to the 'mercy' rule as the contest came to a premature end.

England raced into a 5-0 lead after the opening end and it was soon 11-0 after another 5-0 score in the third end.

Australia claimed their first point in the fourth end, but had to wait till the 11th for their second, by which time England had accumulated 20.

Australia won the 12th end but that was as good as it got as England triumphed.

For Falkner it was a third Commonwealth Games gold medal, after fours victory in Melbourne and a pairs triumph in Delhi.

'We knew we had to start well and get on top and keep the momentum going,' Falkner said.

'It couldn't have been a better performance from our perspective.

'That's a tough call for them to make (the 'mercy' rule), but I think they felt the momentum was with us, we were dominating the game and it was ours.'

For 22-year-old Tolchard - the youngest member of England's bowls team - it was a special victory.

She said: 'I couldn't have wished for anything else. We just wanted to play the best bowls we could and hope that the result would come. We're just so pleased with that.'

Honnor added: 'It's unbelievable. It will take a little while to sink in.'
