It's a complaint heard in grand houses up and down the country – they just can't get the staff.

And it is a problem that even afflicts Downton Abbey as the producers prepare to shoot what will be the sixth – and final – season.

So popular have its stars become that they are cashing in on 'the Downton Factor' to take up lucrative film and television jobs in America.

The majority of the cast have spent the past few months auditioning in Hollywood, and a source said: 'Everyone connected with the show knows that this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.'

One LA producer said: 'I've had more than one agent for the stars of Downton coming on to me asking what is available.

'They've all been in town, trying to get their faces out there, trying to cash in on that goodwill and grab work while they can.

'The Downton Factor has become something of a joke in LA. You can't turn around at a dinner table without seeing another face from the series.

'Of course, most of the Downton cast are classically or theatre-trained, so there's no question that they can act. But the big question is can they prove they are more than one-hit wonders?'

Here we take a look at those who have already gone west as part of the Downton brain drain...

Congratulations to Joanne Froggatt who won a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Anna Bates in Downton Abbey.

She was one of many British stars in attendance and along with Eddie Redmayne and Ruth Wilson she'll be bringing a little statue back to the UK. And it's not just her acting that deserves recognition.

Joanne has been rocking some seriously gorgeous looks recently. We've spotted her in an Emilia Wickstead playsuit, an Ermanno Scervino two-piece and a Stella McCartney dress. And for her moment in the spotlight she opted for this lovely embellished dress by Marchesa.

This label is a safe bet for the red carpet thanks to its high octane glamour and glitzy aesthetic and we love the bandeau neckline and train. It skims her svelte frame beautifully and was the perfect choice for the occasion.

Michelle Dockery played Lady Mary (right) in the hit show. She has now recently finished filming the American film Selfless with co-star Ryan Reynolds. Played an air stewardess opposite Liam Neeson (left), in 2014 airplane thriller Non-Stop. Dockery has become a regular on the Hollywood party scene and is said to be looking to move to either New York or Los Angeles this year

Lesley Nicol (Mrs Patmore): Moved to Hollywood last summer and rents a £2,600-a-month house. Will appear in an episode of sci-fi TV series Supernatural this year and has also won a part in the hit sitcom Hot In Cleveland. She says: ‘Hollywood is where I always dreamed I would end up living. Thanks to Downton, I’ve had the opportunity and I love it. I live in LA in between filming Downton. If I could live here full-time, I would.’

Hugh Bonneville (Earl of Grantham): Appeared in three big-budget movies last year: Paddington, Muppets Most Wanted and Monuments Men with George Clooney, above. Has been ‘commuting’ between the UK, New York and Hollywood, saying: ‘I sometimes feel like I live on a plane.’ Has told friends he would never move permanently to LA but is ‘open’ to the option of living in Tinseltown if roles are offered. ‘Like all actors, I will go where the best work is,’ he says

Julian Fellowes (writer): Moving to New York to concentrate on another period drama, The Gilded Age, about the rivalry of wealthy New York socialites in the 19th Century. Fellowes says: ‘This was a vivid time of record-breaking ostentation and savage rivalry – a time when money was king.’ Sound familiar?

Jessica Brown Findlay (Lady Sybil): Has completed filming Victor Frankenstein –starring James McAvoy, with Daniel Radcliffe as her love interest Igor – and also The Outcast for BBC Films. She appeared in three films last year: Film4’s The Riot Club, American movie drama Lullaby and American mystery Winter’s Tale, above, opposite Colin Farrell. Her next project is the British movie Everything Carries Me To You

Dan Stevens (Matthew Crawley): The most successful Downton graduate, Dan has been busy since his last appearance, the 2012 Christmas special. He has finished filming £50 million thriller Criminal Activities with John Travolta and £20 million drama The Ticket with Malin Akerman. He co-stars with Drew Barrymore in How To Be Single, out later this year, and is in a remake of Beauty And The Beast with Emma Watson. Appeared in four movies last year, including The Guest, right. ‘Everyone wants to emulate Dan,’ a studio source said
