Middle-class children face being priced out of private education as an influx of rich overseas pupils pushes fees up.

Independent schools are having to invest in staff and facilities to attract a ‘global middle-class’ and compete with schools in the US and Australia that are aiming for the same market.

But the trend means British families must meet the higher fees that those from China and other boom economies are prepared to pay, private school leaders warn.

Etonians at School: As school fees continue to rise, middle-classes could be squeezed out of places like Eton

William Richardson, the general secretary of the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, said: ‘The global middle-class is absolutely vast, as is the money they generate.’

Research has already shown that average fees have risen four-fold in a little over 20 years, leaving private education increasingly unaffordable for parents in traditionally well-paid careers such as law and accountancy.

Heads’ leaders have revealed that part of the problem is the cost of competing globally.

They also said schools were handing out increasing amounts in means-tested bursaries to help Britain’s ‘squeezed middle’. In some, families with incomes of up to £65,000 qualify for help.

The trends emerged at the annual meeting of the HMC, representing 260 leading schools including Eton and Harrow.

Although some schools continued to serve mainly local families, others were targeting the global and domestic market.

Mr Richardson said these operated increasingly in an ‘international environment with all the resources that entails’, adding: ‘For my money, this is a 20-year trend that I just don’t see slowing down at all.’

He said day school headmasters would recruit pupils in the Far East who might come to this country to live with extended family.

Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School (above), said: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it’

Chairman Richard Harman, the headmaster of £32,850-a-year Uppingham School, told the meeting in Newport, South Wales: ‘The costs of excellence in education are high, and to provide world-class education you have to put the resources into it.’ He added: ‘Apart from parents in the UK who are making real sacrifices to send their children to our schools, there are parents from Azerbaijan to Germany to China looking to get the best education for their child in this country.’

A study this year said parents in accountancy, law, finance and academia were less likely to afford an independent education than plumbers were in 1990.

Average annual day fees had more than quadrupled since 1990, from £2,985 to £12,700. Boarding soared from £6,800 to £28,800.

A separate study by Lloyds on costs in 2009 and 2014 found fees up 21 per cent, while average incomes had risen by 5 per cent.

Mr Harman said HMC schools now spent £365million a year on means-tested bursaries.

Middle-class families feel excluded from private education as privilege becomes more ‘toxic’, the conference was told. Former Ofsted head Baroness Morgan said: ‘Privilege is politically and socially toxic now in a way it hasn’t been for years. It is not only the poor that feel excluded, so do many of the middle class.’
