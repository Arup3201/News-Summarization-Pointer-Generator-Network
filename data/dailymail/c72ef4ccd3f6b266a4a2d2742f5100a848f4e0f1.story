When Adolf Hitler was raining bombs down on the East End of London during the Blitz, W.F. Arber & Co, a much-loved printworks, kept going.

An oil bomb hit the print-shop’s back garden but the presses in the shop basement in Roman Road, Bow, kept on rolling.

An incendiary bomb landed in the cistern of the outside lavatory too, but only succeeded in burning off the roof. In another raid, Albert Arber, an auxiliary fireman in the evenings when he wasn’t at his daytime printing job, was killed by a collapsing wall hit by a bomb. And, still, the presses did not stop.

W.F. Arber & Co, a much-loved printworks in Roman Road, Bow, has been forced to close its doors after 117 years due to heavy parking fines and high business rates given out by Tower Hamlets Council

The oldest printing shop in the East End, it has been in business since 1897 — printing pamphlets for Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes, at the turn of the century. But last month, Gary Arber, 82, finally shut up the shop that his grandfather, Walter Arber, built in the final years of Queen Victoria’s reign.

Hitler couldn’t stop the Arbers — but Tower Hamlets Council’s parking policy has.

After 60 years of running the family shop, Mr Arber has now retired along with his wife — who used to work in the shop, selling toys — to their home in Romford in Essex.

Even if there had been a viable business to take over, there are no Arber children to run the business. ‘The buck stops with me,’ he says.

In Mr Arber’s shopfront window, sits a forlorn printed notice — one of his last printing jobs. It reads: ‘Advance Notice – This shop will be closing at the end of May. We have been here for 117 years, printed for the Suffragettes, survived enemy bombing through two World Wars and now we are finished due to Tower Hamlets Council’s  parking policy’.

A spy camera on a pole nearby issues fines to every customer who stops outside in a car — and the shop no longer earns enough to pay the council’s high business rates.

Even a local church minister was fined £65 when she stopped her car outside to pick up two heavy boxes of paper for her church.

There is a bay outside Mr Arber’s premises that promises 20 minutes’ free parking for loading. But two spy cameras at either end of a stretch of Roman Road snap away every five minutes — and if the car is not actually being loaded when those photos are taken, a £130 fine (halved if paid promptly) wings its way to the poor unsuspecting customer.

‘Once bitten, they just don’t come back again,’ says a wistful Gary Arber, a sprightly, jocular figure with fond tales of old East End life.

Onwer Gary Arber, from Romford, had to pay a £2,000 instalment of the £6,300 annual business rates - money he couldn't afford as parking rates had put off customers

‘It’s been bad for the last ten years or so, ever since the council introduced harsher parking restrictions. Once, it was possible to park everywhere round here for free. The rates used to be manageable but now they just don’t make sense.

‘The council makes more than we do out of the shop.’

Tragically, Arber & Co is not the only small firm to be brought to its knees by the army of council parking wardens across the country.

Figures show £150,000 of spot fines are issued by councils daily thanks to CCTV cameras. And in the last five years, town halls gave out £310 million in traffic and parking fines.

The final straw for Mr Arber came last October when he had to pay a £2,000 instalment of the £6,300 annual business rates. But the firm — crippled by a lack of customers, sparked by the council’s parking policy — was no longer able to pay its way.

Mary Portas — TV’s Mary, Queen Of Shops — visited recently in a bid to help the businesses of Roman Road. But she couldn’t save Arber & Co.

And so Mr Arber had to make the tragic decision to pull the shutters down on more than a century of family history. The property developer who bought the building from him will convert it into flats.

Founder Walter Arber began the business as a paper-bag maker to satisfy the demand for bags printed with shop details, in newly-built premises. His wife, Emily, sold toys there too.

This pattern — of a Mr Arber doing the printing and a Mrs Arber selling toys — continued for three generations right until Gary Arber’s day.

You can still make out the faded adverts for Scalextric cars and Chopper bicycles (‘For trendy shoppers’), pasted onto the original Victorian timber shop fittings. The counter has been rubbed away into a smooth, gentle dip by a million transactions; one glass-fronted cabinet has a wooden edge nibbled away by the punctures from a thousand drawing pins.

During World War I, the business, which had expanded into bookbinding, remained open, and in the 1930s, Walter Arber designed a new paper tea package. The business flourished in World War II, thanks to government printing contracts — fulfilled even as the Blitz began.

‘The shop garden was destroyed by an oil bomb and the high wall flattened the garden,’ says Gary Arber. ‘My grandparents had a lucky escape as they only got out of the Anderson shelter before the wall came down on it.’

Albert, his volunteer firefighter uncle, wasn’t so lucky.

‘He was manning a pump just round the corner, when a bomb brought a wall down and killed him.

‘His wife was pregnant with his first child, who he never saw. A blue plaque marks the spot where he died.’

Mr Arber has removed his historic presses from the basement. They ranged from a 1900 Wharfedale press to a 1952 Glockner Mercedes. Trays of type still remain in his first-floor office — like all master printers, Mr Arber can still read print backwards as it lies set in metal. On his desk sits a page of metal print, set in 1950, that reads, ‘Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries: TB testing.’

Among the equipment the Arbers owned was a 1939 Heidelberg press.

‘My father bought it,’ says Mr Arber, ‘We were about to pay the Germans when war broke out. We paid the British government instead. I never found out if they paid the Germans later.’

Most of the presses have been taken to Catseye Press, in Happisburgh, Norfolk, to form part of a private collection of vintage printing machines. But one remains – the 1900 Golding press on which the Arbers printed leaflets for the Suffragettes. This press is to go on show at the Bishopsgate Institute in the City.

‘My grandmother was a Suffragette,’ says Mr Arber, ‘She made my grandfather do their printing for free.’

The printing presses, one pictured, at the business helped print pamphlets for the suffragettes during the fight for the vote. Mr Arber remembers talking to his grandmother about the Suffragettes, he says

Mr Arber remembers talking to his grandmother about the Suffragettes.

‘I think she was the muscle for the movement,’ he says, smiling, ‘I was telling her a story about how the Kray twins pushed someone into a canal, and she said she’d done the same for the Suffragettes.’

The Krays also used to get their printing done for their boxing promotions at Arber & Co. ‘The twins were decent blokes,’ says Mr Arber, ‘If anyone mugged an old lady around here, they ended up on the wrong side of the twins. They had standards.’

By the time the Krays hit the East End, Gary Arber was running the family firm. His father died in 1954, at the age of 53, and Gary had to give up a career in the RAF, to run it.

‘As the business was still employing a large staff and family members, I had to buy myself out of my very happy RAF career,’ he says, ‘I have been stuck here since then.’

Mr Arber isn’t a sentimental man but you can sense a sadness beneath his chirpy exterior. ‘I was happy to carry on working,’ he says, ‘I don’t like being beaten.’

You can see why. If your family has seen off Hitler — and the Kaiser — it’s deeply depressing to be killed off by the parking czars of a tinpot council.
