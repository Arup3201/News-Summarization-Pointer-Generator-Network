The Northumberland Church of England Academy is the second school in the country to adopt a 'cradle to university' policy by offering childcare for newborns

An academy school is now accepting pupils from birth after launching a 'cradle to university' scheme to help youngsters get ahead.

The Northumberland Church of England Academy (NCEA) in Ashington, Northumberland, is only the second school in the country to offer childcare for newborn babies.

It was a government initiative first adopted by St Bede Academy in Bolton, Greater Manchester, to help tackle issues in early years, including speech and language acquisition.

The scheme, known as childminder agencies (CMA) and set up by the Department for Education in September last year, also helps self-employed childminders find work.

Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment.

Headteacher at NCEA, Andrew Day, said: 'We want to be able to do the best for every single child and believe that having children from cradle to university is the best way to do this.

'Up to 50 per cent of our children starting school have speech and language acquisition issues and we hope that this will help address such issues. 

'Evidence suggests that educational outcome is set from the age of two for the vast majority of children.

'We are working in partnership with our parents, we want to change the outcomes for our children.'

Mr Day, who oversees a school of more than 2,400 students, added: 'Often our parents come as single parents, with jobs and are busy. We need to take the pressure and burden off them. 

'It's not about patronising people, it's about giving them an extra layer of support.

The Northumberland Church of England Academy (pictured) has launched the government and Ofsted-approved scheme, known as childminder agencies or CMA to help children with their transition to nursery

'They will be cared for by childminders in a home environment, but we will work with parents and childminders to ensure that each child can be the best that they can be.'

CMA is self-funded by the school, which then charges childminders a fee when they register and also to the parents who use their services.

The academy, which caters for pupils up to the age of 19, has a centre for children with profound and severe learning difficulties.

It also recently opened three new early years centres offering 120 free nursery places for eligible two-year-olds. 

Clare Lishman, the academy's director of early years, said: 'This is an exciting expansion to our early years provision.

'Research shows that it is the quality of the provision, whether it is in a nursery setting or with a childminder, that delivers the best long term benefits for a child's development.

'Rapid development takes place between the ages zero and three and investing in early years provision is vital to equip children with the skills they need to start their education.

Childminders will volunteer with the school and in return receiving training and business advice, while parents are offered affordable childminding in a home environment 

'Childminders who join the agency will receive lots of support from the academy and be part of the early years provision in the school.'

The Ofsted-approved scheme was first piloted in the summer 2013 with 20 organisations nationwide, including primary schools, nurseries and councils.

St Bede Academy was the only school to continue the trial at the end of last year.

Headteacher, Jack Hatch, said at the time: 'Achieving our goal of being the first CMA to be registered in the UK means a lot to our childcare organisation.

'It should help to provide more of our families with excellent-quality affordable childcare and give even more flexibility than we can offer at the present time.'
