Tim Sherwood thinks that Mauricio Pochettino secretly believes Spurs can win the Premier League. Maybe that explains the 10 changes from Arsenal. 

You’d hope it was the reason for the decision, because fielding weakened teams in this competition is folly given the winners are handed a route into the Champions League - even if the hosts stretched their European record to just three defeats in 18.

Slaven Bilic was surely sporting one of the bushiest beards ever to have graced an English touchline. The Besiktas manager’s smart club suit didn’t particularly mirror his unkempt facial hair; the way in which the Croat’s arms flailed and head shook certainly did.

Tottenham had the right idea beforehand in light of Galatasaray’s midweek antics, making sure the travelling contingent’s majority were housed inside a good 90 minutes before kick-off.

The Turkish supporters marched through north London in full voice but then appeared to be more bothered about turning away chanting at each other than watching the game.

Demba Ba went into this with four goals in five for three different clubs against Spurs. The striker was clearly fired up in a bid to add to that - smacking the bar just after smashing an arm into the face of Vlad Chiriches. Nobody can accuse the ex-Chelsea man of not putting himself about.

Ba was involved in a heart-warming man hug at the break with Emmanuel Adebayor, who had waited for him before making his way down the tunnel.

Mauricio Pochettino is better off leaving his players to it. As we ticked towards half-time, the Spurs boss retrieved a ball to have strayed out of play, unsuccessfully attempted to juggle it before losing control. He rightfully picked it up and volleyed back out of his hands. Wise.

Edgar Davids was at the Lane - a place he calls ‘the old nest’. The former midfielder - who was last seen playing himself (and frequently seeing red) as manager of Barnet - is still a favourite here.

Poor old fourth official Mike Pickel got it in both ears from Bilic and Pochettino simultaneously thanks to the incompetence of referee Manuel Grafe. First Spurs were inexplicably allowed to continue when Gokhan Tore was poleaxed on halfway, with Tomas Sivok then very fortunate to get away with hacking down Moussa Dembele just outside the box.

The German officials didn’t have the best evening of their careers, it has to be said.
