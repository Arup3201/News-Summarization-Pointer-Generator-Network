A stunning supercar has smashed the record for the world's fastest accelerating motor -after hitting 186mph in just 13.63 seconds.

The Hennessey Venom GT is a Texan-built supercar powered by a 7-litre V8 engine developing a whopping 1,244bhp.

On Sunday it showed the world just how quick it was when Hennessey took it to a runway in Houston, USA, to attempt a new world record for acceleration.

0-186mph (300kph) in 13.63 seconds - the same time it takes a diesel Ford Fiesta to hit 60mph.

Top speed of 270mph (if the team can find a runway long enough to test it)

The Venom GT rocketed from 0-186mph (300kph) in 13.63 seconds - the same time it takes a diesel Ford Fiesta to hit 60mph.

Guinness World Records were there to verify the time - with Hennessey taking the record from the similarly outrageous Koenigsegg Agera which did 0-186mph in 14.53 seconds.

The Â£910,000 supercar also managed 0-200mph in 14.51 seconds - a staggering 7.7 seconds quicker than the Bugatti Veyron Super Sport.

Flat-out the Venom GT, which was piloted by test driver John Kiewicz, did 0-100mph in 5.88 seconds and after one-mile had reached 205mph.

John Hennessey, the boss of Hennessey Performance, today revealed he was going after the record for top speed, which is currently held by the 268mph Veyron Super Sport.

But the firm will have its work cut out to find somewhere to hit this speed - with Bugatti having special access to Volkswagen's Ehra-Lessien test track in Germany.

He said: 'We are exceptionally proud of our team at HPE who helped to make this new Guinness World Record possible.

'It was a great moment, but this is just the beginning and we plan to set a few more speed records as part of our Venom GT validation process.

The Venom GT rocketed from 0-186mph (300kph) in 13.63 seconds on this runway in Houston - and now the team are looking for a longer runway so it can reach its top speed of 270mph

'We are in the process of looking for a runway or toll road long enough to make some top speed runs.

'A flat four mile stretch of road would be ideal and we're confident the Venom GT will do 270mph-plus.'

Hennessey plans to build just 29 Venom GTs with each model taking six months to build.

The firm has sold ten models so far with Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler owning a convertible edition.
