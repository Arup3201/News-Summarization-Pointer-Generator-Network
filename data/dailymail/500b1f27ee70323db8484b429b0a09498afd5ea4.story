Personnel from the New York City Medical Examiner's office, as well as fire and police departments were at the scene today - located blocks away from the World Trade Center site.

The aircraft part was discovered last Wednesday, wedged between an apartment building and a Park51, the planned site of a controversial mosque.

Investigation: Police and officials from the New York City medical examiner's office are seen in the area where a plane part was found last week, just blocks away from the World Trade Center site

The search for remains at the 
location is the second effort this year to find possible victims from 9/11.

The other attempt began on 
April 1 on Staten Island, and is focused on construction debris collected in the months after the terror attack.

Of the nearly 3,000 victims, the remains of about 1,000 have never been recovered, 
much to the anguish of families who still have nothing to bury, nearly 
12 years later.

Boeing confirmed on Sunday that the rusted five-foot 
plane piece is in fact a part of one of the 
aircraft that crashed into the World Trade Center more than a decade ago.

Officials said it's a trailing edge flap support structure, police said.

It is located closer to the body of 
the plane and helps secure wing flaps that move in and out and aid in 
regulating plane speed.

Pivotal piece: The machinery was originally thought to be part of the engine but it is actually a portion of the 767 Trailing Edge Flaps from one of the two planes that slammed into the World Trade Center

Found: part of a landing gear from one of the 9/11 planes was discovered wedged between buildings with a mysterious rope around it

Investigators initially thought it was part of the landing gear because both pieces have similar-looking hydraulics.

Boeing officials told police the part came from one of the two 767 airliners that struck the Twin Towers, but it isn't possible to determine which one.

Workers discovered the part Wednesday
between a luxury loft rental building and a mosque that in 2010 
prompted virulent national debate about Islam and freedom of speech in 
part because it's near the trade center site.

The airplane part was discovered wedged between 51 Park Place, the site of the proposed 13-story Islamic cultural center Park51, and 50 Murray Street, a luxury apartment building in TriBeCa.

Intact: The gear found mere blocks from Ground Zero, and bears a clear Boeing ID mark

Other World Trade Center wreckage has been discovered at the buildings and around the area in years past.

An inspector on the roof of the mosque site, which is under construction, noticed the debris and then called 911.

Police documented the debris with photos and have secured the area as if it were a crime scene.

The twisted metal part - jammed in an
18-inch-wide, trash-laden passageway between the buildings - has cables
and levers on it and is about 5 feet high, 17 inches wide and 4 feet 
long.

Search: Of the nearly 3,000 victims, the remains of about 1,000 people have never been recovered, much to the anguish of families who still have nothing to bury

Probe: Members of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner confer near the building in Lower Manhattan

Some answers: Officials held a press conference in front of the buildings (pictured) where the gear was found

The piece was found with ropes that 
aren't believed be part of the plane.

Police are trying to determine 
whether someone had tried to lower the piece off the roof at some point 
in the past, and the ropes snapped or the piece became stuck.

There's no indication that the part 
was planted in the space, said Paul Browne, chief spokesman for the New 
York Police Department.

Police said the plane part would be moved 
to a more secure location likely later this week, where a determination 
will be made about where it will go permanently.

In the past, such 
pieces have been treated as historical artifacts.
