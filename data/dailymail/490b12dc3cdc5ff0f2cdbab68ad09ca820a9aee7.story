Many swear by its healing qualities, health gurus prescribe it for everything from bad skin to stomach ulcers and now crooks are counterfeiting it for huge profits.

Manuka honey has acquired a quasi-magical reputation as a natural cure for an amazing variety of ailments.

The model Lizzie Jagger uses it as lip balm in the belief that it will protect her from germs.

The actress Scarlett Johansson says that she has regular manuka facials to ‘pull the impurities’ from her skin. And opera singer Katherine Jenkins drinks manuka dissolved in hot water to help her voice.

But such miraculous qualities come at a price. Forget the £1.79 you might pay for some runny honey to spread on your toast in the morning, pots of this panacea can sell for up to £60 for a 500g jar.

It has been nicknamed ‘liquid gold’ — and so it has proved for unscrupulous sellers, who package ordinary honeys as ‘manuka’ and sell them for £30 a jar.

Official figures, published in The  Grocer magazine, show that only 1,700 tons of manuka are produced annually, while around 10,000 tons are sold. The market is flooded with fakes.

But is there any scientific basis for the claims for this wonder honey? Or have we been duped into spending a fortune on a product with no real health benefits?

Genuine manuka honey is produced by bees whose hives are near flowering wild manuka bushes. These grow mainly on New Zealand’s North Island and are used in Maori medicine for colds, stomach upsets and as a painkiller.

Until the 1980s, beekeepers used to throw manuka honey away because of its strong medicinal taste. At best, it would be used in cattle feed.

Then scientists at the University of Waikato in Hamilton, New Zealand, began to make strong claims for its curative powers. Biochemist Professor Peter Molan led the investigation.

‘I’m a great believer that if anything is traditional then it works,’ he declared. ‘There may be no rational explanation, but that’s because we haven’t found it.’

Practically all natural honey contains a chemical called glucose oxidase, which helps to produce hydrogen peroxide — a bleaching agent that can kill bacteria, including the antibiotic-resistant hospital superbug MRSA.

Professor Molan claimed that manuka honey is especially potent, as it seems to have additional bacteria-killing powers beyond other honeys.

In a study published in 1991, his team removed the hydrogen peroxide from a range of honeys, including manuka. The investigators reported that only manuka retained the ability to kill bacteria.

Many brands of the honey now carry a Unique Manuka Factor (UMF) number on the label. 

The theory is that the higher the UMF number, the greater its strength at killing bacteria — and the greater the price of the pot.

For example, a 250g pot of Manuka Pharm honey with a UMF factor of 12, sold by the health food shop Holland & Barrett, costs £14.99, while a pot of the same size with a UMF of 24 costs £28.99.

In practice, though, this labelling 
system is not regulated by law in New Zealand, so honey producers can 
effectively stick on whatever numbers they like.

Such confusion has provided a golden opportunity for fraudsters to substitute cheap baker’s honey for the real thing.

The Food Standards Agency in Britain has sent a nationwide alert to all trading standards departments, asking them to watch out for fakes.

Honey suppliers in New Zealand believe that 1,700 tons of manuka is produced there every year — yet 1,800 tons are sold in the UK alone.

As Britain’s trading standards officers start combing the shelves for ‘funny honey’, we ought to question whether even real manuka is worth the price. Independent research does seem to support some of the claims.

Investigators at the University of Wales Institute and Cardiff Metropolitan University, for example, report that manuka can, in lab tests, kill the hospital superbugs Clostridium difficile and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Furthermore, vets have found manuka to be effective on infected wounds on horses when applied externally.

But such claims do not necessarily mean manuka is a miracle cure-all.

Take just one example. The honey is widely claimed by alternative practitioners to provide an effective remedy for stomach ulcers.

This is based on research showing that manuka can kill a bacteria responsible for them, Helicobacter pylori, in the laboratory.

However, clinical trials have shown that the lab results do not translate to real life: when patients swallowed the honey to try to cure or alleviate their ulcers, it didn’t work.

This may well be due to the fact that the stomach breaks down the honey before it gets to the ulcer.

Similarly, there is no reputable published independent clinical evidence to support widespread claims for manuka’s unique power to cure or prevent sore throats when swallowed, or to banish acne when applied externally.

Much of the evidence supporting manuka’s benefits has been produced by the Honey Research Unit — part-funded by New Zealand’s beekeepers — at the University of Waikato.

But in 2012, the university shut down all the unit’s web pages without explanation. Commentators in New Zealand believe the university has turned its back on the studies.

However, across the world, other universities have been trumpeting the benefits of their own local honeys.

Scientists at the University of Thessaly in Greece reported, in January, the results of tests on 31 local Greek and Cypriot honeys which investigated their superbug-killing abilities.

They claimed that some have the potential to be just as effective as manuka, and may even contain their own unique bug-killing powers.

Scientists at two Canadian universities have reported how honey made from the country’s buckwheat flowers may be as effective as manuka at killing harmful bacteria.

They also found that honey made from Canadian clover may have as much potential as manuka to be a remedy for skin rashes caused by shingles.

Biologists at the Slovak Academy of Sciences concluded in April 2011 that: ‘Slovak honeydew honey has exceptional antibacterial activity against multi-drug-resistant S. maltophilia and was more efficient than manuka honey.’

All of this leaves manuka in a rather dubious position as regards its ‘unique’ effectiveness. The trouble seems to be a lack of reputable ‘double-blind’ studies.

The best that can be said is that — like all natural honeys — it seems to have some beneficial bacteria-killing powers. And unless you gobble the stuff down like Pooh Bear, you can’t really do yourself any harm by taking it.

Unfortunately, however, the science does not justify manuka’s hype. Instead the product has become, all too often, a very expensive honey trap.
