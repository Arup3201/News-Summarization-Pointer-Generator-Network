Gunmen turned a quiet London street into a Quentin Tarantino movie scene with a dawn shoot-out outside a birthday party.

Two men died and another survived being shot six times at point-blank range in an act of revenge outside Sugar Lounge nightclub in Forest Gate, east London as one of the gunmen took ‘the law into his own hands’.

Gunman Michael Smith was found guilty of murdering two men and given two life sentences  with a minimum term of 34 years at the Old Bailey.

After shooting Eugene Brown, 27, and Patrick Ford, 36, outside the nightclub, Kevin Powell chased him through a suburban street and shot him repeatedly six times, including once in the head. He was found guilty of attempting to murder Smith, following a retrial, and jailed for 34 years.

The mayhem started on May 29, 2010 when Brown fired four bullets into the ceiling of the nightclub during the party. He was then followed out of the club by Smith and Nana Oppong, whose birthday celebrations it was.

Smith shot him and Mr Ford, who died at the scene, despite being surrounded by party-goers who had spilled out onto the pavement after shots were fired in the club. Mr Brown died six weeks later in hospital.

Powell then chased Smith down a suburban street and shot Smith at point-blank range six times, once in the head. During the attack, Smith still managed to get up and run, before being shot at a second time and then diving into an open car window before being dumped in the doorway of a hospital.

At least 24 bullets were fired at him, some becoming embedded in houses with one going through a living room window. Much of the terrifying crime was captured on CCTV which was played to the jury.

Unemployed Smith, 28, of Canning Town and student Powell, 37, of Harlesden stood trial together today.

William Boyce, QC, prosecuting, told the
jury: ‘Mr Smith must be one of the most fortunate men alive, he has no 
right to be alive.

‘Mr Powell had taken the law into his own hands and had gone out to exact his own revenge.

‘Mr Powell went after Mr Smith and caught up with him in a side road and shot him several times at virtually point-blank range.

‘He peppered Mr Smith with bullets but still did not manage to kill him.’

Judge Brian Barker, the Common Serjeant of London said: ‘This was a brutal and callous use of powerful weapons in London streets with a complete indifference to the results.

‘These were acts of revenge done in the streets with complete disregard for the public.’

Smith and Powell were also given concurrent ten-year terms for the firearms offences.

Oppong, 32, a cleaner, of Stratford, was previously cleared of murder and a firearms charge after two juries failed to reach verdicts but he was jailed for two years after being found guilty of perverting justice.

Two women working at the Sugar Lounge were found guilty of perverting justice and were jailed in September, last year.

Dajsha Stancillas, 31, of Forest Gate, removed bullet casings from the floor of the Sugar Lounge and was jailed for a year.

Camilla Ghimpu, 26, also of Forest Gate, got rid of the bullet cases after being handed them by Stancillas, her boss and received six months in jail.

Brown’s friend Nerissa Harris, 29, of Chingford, was found guilty of perverting justice for taking a gun from Mr Brown after he was shot.

She placed it in a car and it was then spirited away by a man who has never been identified. She was jailed for 18 months.
