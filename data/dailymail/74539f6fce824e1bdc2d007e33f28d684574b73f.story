Italy goalkeeper Salvatore Sirigu says his side are desperate to erase the memory of their 2010 World Cup debacle.

Going into the tournament as holders, the Italians crashed out in the group stages accumulating just two points from games against Paraguay, New Zealand and Slovakia.

The Italians, managed by Cesare Prandelli, will have the opportunity to put that right against England in their World Cup opener on June 14.

And the 
Paris St Germain keeper said: 'We have to forget what happened at the 
last World Cup. We are looking to the future, we have prepared well and 
we are very determined. 

'It's
 very important that we start the tournament with a bang. We are looking
 forward to starting the World Cup with a game against England.

'At
 the moment we are doing a lot of physical work. It's been hard because 
the last couple of weeks have been extremely tough, but we want to make 
sure we arrive in good shape for our first match.'

The
 Italians have been rocked by the news that key midfielder Riccardo 
Montolivo will miss the tournament after sustaining a broken leg in 
Saturday's goalless draw against Republic of Ireland at Craven Cottage.

Sirigu's club team-mate Marco Verratti is now poised to replace Montolivo in Prandelli's midfield for the clash against England.

'The injury [to Montolivo] was something very negative for us. He's a great guy, who works so well with everyone. 

'It's such a shame to have that so close to the World Cup.'
