Paul Walker's younger brother 
Cody began the heart-breaking task of clearing up the late actor’s 
personal belongings on Wednesday, as his family try to terms with their tragic loss.

A 
grief-stricken Cody Walker, 25, visited his late brother's home in Santa
 Barbara, California, on Wednesday afternoon and later could be seen 
packing boxes of the Fast & Furious star’s possessions into the back of a car.

As Cody packed the trunk with items including clothes, a surf board, a rifle and 
several boxes, a concerned neighbor stopped to give him a hug and pass 
on her condolences.

Paul Walker's younger brother Cody takes a moment to contemplate as he spent several hours on Wednesday removing items from the Fast & Furious star's Santa Barbara home

The gates to the actor's home has become something of a shrine in recent days as fans wishing to pay their respects have left countless bouquets of flowers and candles.

Paul
 Walker tragically died in a car crash on Nov. 30, when the Porsche that
 his friend Roger Rodas was driving smashed into a light pole and tree.

According to an autopsy released on Wednesday, Walker was killed by injuries from both the impact and the subsequent fire.

The
 actor died from the ‘combined effects of traumatic and thermal 
injuries,’ according to the autopsy released by the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office.

The 2005 Porsche Carrera GT was
 driven by Rodas, who was dead from ‘multiple traumatic injuries’ 
before the car exploded in flames, the autopsy said.

Results of toxicology testing will take another six to eight weeks.

Walker starred in all but one of the six Fast & Furious blockbuster films that glorified fast cars and dangerous driving.

Sheriff's
 investigators are still trying to determine what caused Rodas to career
 out of control on Saturday. They have said speed was a factor in the crash
 about 30 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles.

The limited-edition Porsche was 
previously owned by IndyCar driver Graham Rahal, who has said it was 
difficult to drive. It is not just fast - it can hit 100 mph in less 
than 7 seconds - but also unforgiving in its handling.

Paul Walker's brother Cody, 25, spent Wednesday clearing up his late brother's belongings, on the same day that an autopsy revealed that the actor had died from the 'combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries'

Little more than a month before the 
actor's tragic death on Saturday, the Walker family had celebrated a family 
wedding as another brother, Caleb, 36, had married his fiancée Stephanie
 Branch.

Paul was best man on the big day and Cody a groomsman in the now poignant photos that show
 the brothers laughing and smiling together for what would be one of the last ever times.

The stunning album of pictures give a
 glimpse of the close-knit family who are now grieving following the 
actor's death.

With a smile on his face and a cheeky 
glint in his eye, the Fast & Furious star can be seen toasting his brother Caleb on his special day.

Paul is also seen posing with his 
fellow groomsmen at the wedding held on October 23 at Dove Canyon 
Country Club in Orange County, California.

The Walker clan are said to be 
extremely close and earlier this week, Paul's sister Ashlie Walker told 
MailOnline the family are trying to cope by using their Mormon faith.

Furious
 Ashlie, 37, also hit out at reports her brother and his good friend
 Roger Rodas - who was at the wheel of a Porsche when they crashed in 
Los Angeles on Saturday - were drag racing at the time of their death.

Breaking
 her silence, Miss Walker said: 'They were absolutely not racing, that's
 a complete lie. It hurts us when we hear these lies and it makes our 
grief worse and more painful.

'These
 are irresponsible allegations and people are trying to make out speed 
and racing was the reason for his death when it was just a terrible 
accident.'

A close family member said Paul would
 be the 'biggest angel in heaven', adding: ‘Paul was a wonderful man and
 the best person you could ever meet. We are all totally distraught and 
beside ourselves with grief.

‘We
 can gain hope from this tragic accident through our strong Christian 
background and faith. We are grateful to be surrounded by such loving 
friends and family that have been praying for us and will be forever by 
our sides.

'We seek comfort 
in their love and our faith. We definitely believe that Paul has gone to
 a better place and is now with our heavenly father.

'We have a strong Mormon faith and although Paul wasn’t practicing at the time, he always had a very strong Christian faith.'

Meanwhile, Universal Pictures announced 
that it has shut down production for an unspecified time on the seventh 
installment of the Fast & Furious franchise.

The studio announced Wednesday that 
the film will shut down 'for a period of time so we can assess all 
options available to move forward with the franchise.'

The seventh installment of the street
 car racing series had begun shooting in September. While much of Fast 
& Furious 7 has been filmed, it's far from complete.

When Walker died in a fiery car crash Saturday north of Los Angeles, the film was on break for the Thanksgiving holiday.

Shooting had been planned to resume Monday in Atlanta, but production was put on hold following Walker's death.

Universal had been trying to 
fast-track Fast & Furious 7 for a July 11 release, a date that's 
likely to be postponed. Universal hasn't yet announced any release date 
change.

'Right now, all of us at Universal 
are dedicated to providing support to Paul's immediate family and our 
extended Fast & Furious family of cast, crew and filmmakers,' the 
studio said in a statement.

Walker starred in all but one 
installment of the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, which has been 
particularly lucrative for Universal. Fast & Furious 6, released in 
May, was the highest grossing film in the series, earning more than $788
 million worldwide.

Universal announced on Tuesday that 
it will donate a portion of the proceeds from the upcoming DVD, Blu-ray 
and digital release of Fast & Furious 6 to Walker's charity Reach 
Out Worldwide.

Walker, 40, founded Reach Out 
Worldwide in 2010 to give first-response aid to victims of natural 
disasters. Walker was hosting a fundraiser for the nonprofit on Saturday
 afternoon before the crash.

Memorial: Fans stand by the scene of the crash in which Paul Walker lost his life. Police are still investigating the tragedy - but have ruled out a theory the star and his friend were drag racing
