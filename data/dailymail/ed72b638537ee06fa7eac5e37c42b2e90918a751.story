It has survived 900 years of bombs, battles and plagues.

But this idyllic 12th century church could not survive the fire that ripped through it hours before last Sunday's service.

The once-iconic wooden vestry was destroyed, leaving its bells missing amid the rubble.

Almost destroyed: The original roof and many pews were destroyed in the blaze that tore through the church

Firefighters battled the blaze for an hour at St Andrews Church in Romsey, Hampshire, just three-and-a-half hours before its regular Sunday service.

Too dangerous for them to go inside, they used six pumps to put out the flames and stayed for several hours to prevent the fire flaring again.

Only some of the church's treasures, including an irreplaceable 1613 'chained' Bible, were saved.

A 13th century wooden chest was badly damaged and a limestone font, with graffiti from 1681, was severely damaged, possibly beyond repair.

The West Window, in memory of a much-loved churchwarden Bill Watkinson, was destroyed.

Around half of the roof at the west end has been gutted but the east end is relatively unscathed, including a 13th century screen.

Churchwarden Catherine Baker said: 'I can't really believe it.

'I was called by a neighbour who saw smoke and I could hear the crackling. I feel absolute horror.

'The most shocking thing was seeing the flames. As far as I know we have never had a fire before.

'If the fire brigade had not got here the roof would have been completely destroyed.

'They have been wonderful, as have all the neighbours who raised the alarm.

'My husband Bill and daughter Isabel, who were first on the scene, saw things falling off the roof.

'There was not a lot we could do.'

Churchgoer Peter Pritchett-Brown said: 'It is awful to see something like this happen to something that has stood here for so long.'

The little 20 metres by eight metres church was due to hold a Sunday service at 11am for its 20 regular worshippers.

However, parishioners gathered for prayers in a nearby house with Rev Canon Steve Pittis.

The alarm was raised at 7.27am and the cause of the blaze is unclear and is still being investigated.

Nobody was injured.

Fire borough commander Dan Tasker said: 'The damage is quite extensive.

'The fire started at one end and spread into the roof and, unfortunately, half has been destroyed.

'It was a well-developed fire when the first crews arrived but the crews worked incredibly hard to stop it spreading.'
