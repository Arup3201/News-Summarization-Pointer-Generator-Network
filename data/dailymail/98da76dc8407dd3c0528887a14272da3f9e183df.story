Ann Romney says she's glad people watching the first presidential debate have been able to see her husband, Republican presidential pick Mitt Romney, as she does: 'A good and decent person.'

Speaking today before introducing her husband, Mrs Romney says people got to see the former Massachusetts governor as someone who cares for others - and that Americans will be able to see him display that quality again when he gets people back to work.

The campaign wants to soften her husband's image in the final weeks of the campaign and maintain his focus on the middle class.

At the same event, Romney promised he would 'not raise taxes on middle class families!'

Romney's campaign said that 12,000 people attended the event, including 3,000 in an overflow area.

Romney has enjoyed a two point boosted in in the respected Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll, as well as a $12million boost in online donations since the debate.

He has used the new momentum to go on the offensive against Obama.

However, he launched another ad defending his tax plan against the president's claims that Romney plans to cut taxes by $5trillion balanced mostly on the backs of the middle class.

Mitt Romney, campaigning in up-for-grabs Florida, sought to build on the momentum from a debate performance last week that even Democrats conceded was 'masterful.'

The Republican told a crowd of about 12,000 in Port St Lucie that he had enjoyed himself, ticking off a list of Obama shortcomings he said he had exposed during the first debate.

Romney said: 'Now of course, days later, we're hearing his excuses. And next January we'll be watching him leave the White House for the last time.'

Romney on Monday plans a major foreign policy address at the Virginia Military Institute, intended to throw Obama back on his heels over his handling of unrest in Libya and elsewhere.

Obama campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki, dismissing what she called Romney's fourth or fifth attempt to explain his global intentions, said the bar is high for Romney to convince voters he's prepared to be commander in chief.

'We are not going to be lectured by someone who's been an unmitigated disaster on foreign policy every time he sticks his toe in the foreign policy waters,' Psaki said aboard Air Force One as Obama made his way to California.

Even as Romney sought to reap further rewards from his debate performance, a string of good news for the president threatened to steal the former Massachusetts governor's spotlight.

A jobs report Friday showing unemployment at the lowest levels of Obama's presidency was quickly followed Saturday by a fundraising report showing Obama and Democrats had raised $181million in September.

It was their best fundraising month of the campaign, but fell short of their record $190million raised in September 2008 as the president campaigned for his first term.

Romney's campaign has not released its report for the month, and Republicans sought to downplay Obama's financial advantage.

The party's national chairman, Reince Priebus, said on CNNâ€™s State of the Union that he had been counting all along on being outraised by Obama and Democrats.

'This isn't going to come down to 
money. This is going to come down to heart,' Priebus said. 'We'll beat 
them on the ground, and we'll have all the money we need to be 
competitive.'

In what will 
be his final fundraising trip out West this election, Obama is enlisting
his celebrity pals - from actors to singers to chefs - to donate to his
campaign and encourage their fans to do the same.

In one event alone, a late-night soiree high above the Los Angeles skyline, Obama expected to rake in $3.75million.

Romney's campaign released a new ad claiming Obama is not telling the truth when he says Romney wants to cut $5trillion in taxes.

Both campaigns were prepping their running mates for Thursday's vice presidential debate - and working to keep expectations low lest their candidate underperform.

On Sunday, Priebus called Vice President Joe Biden 'a gifted orator.'

Newt Gingrich, R-Georgia, who challenged Romney in the GOP primary, suggested on NBC's Meet the Press that Paul Ryan would hold back on any hostility out of respect for Biden's status as a senior statesman.
