As the weather gets warmer many of us will dust off our large and cumbersome bladed fans.

But Panasonic has developed a lighter, smaller and more powerful alternative that can blow out seven times more air than it sucks in.

The Sokaze-ki Q uses fluid dynamics to take air in at the rear of the 10-inch (25cm) device, move it through specially designed channels before blasting it from the front via a turbofan.

Panasonic Japan, which designed the device, said that once the turbofan has moved the air flow to the front of the device, a 'high-pressure jet airflow' creates straight, direct blasts of air. Alternatively, the Q has a '1/f fluctuation' function that reduces the force of the air flow, and sends 'natural wind' that mimics outside breeze

These channels have been designed to reduce how much drag the air flow is subjected to as it moves through the 'ball'. 

And the holes have been designed in such a way so that the flow collects additional air at is leaves the device to boost its trajectory and output. 

In particular, there is a central outlet. Air is drawn into the 'Q' using small inlets on the rear and are driven by the so-called impellers, or bladed fins.

This airflow pulls in additional air using the large round air inlets plotted around the Q, and all of this is released through the main outlet.

The fan is on sale in Japan for ¥39,350 (£220) and is available in Crystal Red, Champagne Gold (pictured) and Pearl White. It is powered by a DC motor and comes with an Off Timer for between one and three hours

'Everything is up to you,' as the firm explained. 

'It can be used as circulator. Or as a fan. We will deliver the combined wind in your life.'

The Q fan has a diameter of 10 inches (25cm), is 11 inches tall (27cm) and weighs 4.6lbs (2.1kg)

MailOnline has contacted Panasonic to see if the device will be available in other regions.  

It is powered by a DC motor plugged into the mains and comes with an Off Timer for between one and three hours.
