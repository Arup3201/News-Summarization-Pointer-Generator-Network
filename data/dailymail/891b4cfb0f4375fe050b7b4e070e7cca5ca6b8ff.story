Confession: Nabeel Hussain was arrested at Stansted on September 23 as he tried to board a plane to Turkey on a fake passport

A terrorist freed early from jail after plotting to blow up transatlantic planes has admitted trying to sneak out of Britain on a fake passport.

Nabeel Hussain, 30, who was convicted in 2009 for his part in a suicide mission to blow up seven passenger jets with liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks, was arrested at Stansted on  September 23 as he tried to board a plane to Turkey.

Detectives believe he was planning to cross its border into Syria to join Al Qaeda militants, which Hussain denied.

The suicide plot, which was smashed in 2006, led to severe restrictions on liquids being taken on to planes. They remain in place today.

Hussain had been jailed for eight years, but had been released half way through his sentence and was on licence when he was caught at Stansted.

Following his arrest, Hussain claimed he was fleeing the country because he had been caught driving without insurance and was scared that he would be sent back to prison for breaching the terms of his licence.

Yesterday at the Old Bailey, Hussain, from Waltham Forest, East London, admitted possession of an identity document with improper intention.

He was remanded in custody at high-security Belmarsh Prison in South London and will be  sentenced next month.
