Salvadoran soccer players were left baffled ahead of their match against Argentina in Washington D.C. on Saturday after the stadium played the wrong national anthem.

Rather than pressing play on 'Himno Nacional de El Salvador', staff at the stadium switched on 'Arrane Ashoonagh Vannin' - an anthem belonging to the Isle of Man, USA Today reported.

A video of the awkward moment shows the players looking at each other and slowly removing their hands from their chests before turning to walk off the pitch.

Shock: Soccer players from El Salvador were confused when the wrong national anthem was played instead of theirs ahead of their match against Argentina in Washington D.C. on Saturday

And it was just the beginning of the bad luck for the team, who lost the friendly match 2-0.

As well as the players from El Salvador, their supporters were unimpressed with the mistake and boos rang out across the field.

Washington is home to one of the largest Salvadoran communities outside of Central America and their followers outnumbered the Argentine support. 

CMN Sports, which organized the match, apologized to the team and the entire Salvadoran community for the 'honest mistake' in a statement on Sunday.

'The organization understands and regrets the unfortunate incident with the El Salvador national anthem at yesterday's friendly match at FedExField,' it said.

'CMN SPORTS takes full responsibility for this honest mistake and values all feedback from loyal fans, the Salvadorian community and partners affected by this incident.

'This was not done with malicious intentions and the company will be sure to address this with the right parties to ensure it doesn't happen again.'  

But the damage was already done. Gerardo Martino's side dominated the game and took the lead in the 54th minute thanks to a Nestor Renderos own goal deflected from Ever Banega's shot.

Substitute Federico Mancuello then made sure of the win with a free kick at 88 minutes.
