Google is working on a version of its Android software for televisioons, leaked screenshots have revealed.

The firm previously tried to work with manufacturers, including Sony, on a range of Google TV boxes, which flopped.

However, it appears the search giant is now planning a second assault on the living room to take on Apple, Amazon and the games consoles in the race to become the main living room gadget.

Yahoo and Microsoft have both revealed plans to create their own TV shows in the ever-expanding battle for the living room.

Yahoo has unveiled plans for four shows, while Microsoft is believed to have 12 in development.

They will go up against Amazon, Hulu and Netflix, all of whom are also commissioning their own shows in a bid to change they way we watch TV.

According to documents obtained exclusively by The Verge, Google is about to launch a second attempt at a TV box.

Major video app providers including Hulu, Netflix and Vevo already have apps running on the paltform, accoridnt o screenshots The Verge obtained.

'Android TV is an entertainment interface, not a computing platform,' writes Google.

'It’s all about finding and enjoying content with the least amount of friction. It will be 'cinematic, fun, fluid, and fast.'

It comes just a week after Amazon revealed Fire, its TV set top box.

It is unclear whether the Google system will include Amazon's Instant Video app.

Experts say the company could still face problems by confusing customer who have already bought its Chromecast TV dongle, a $30 device that allows selected apps to show video on a TV.

Google's TV homepage shows a menu system similar to Apple's TV box, with voice control.

'Android TV by the look of things is what Google TV should have been first time around, however is still likely to be met with confusion by customers already trying to understand Google Chromecast,' Stuart Miles of gadget website Pocket Lint told MailOnline.

'Google can’t ignore the move to the television as a way to enjoy connected content as company’s like Roku, Amazon, and Apple still continue to make strong inroads.

The screenshots obtained by The Verge also shows apps on the platform, including Hulu, Netflix and Vevo.

'However it has to make sure lessons are learnt from its first outing and that it doesn’t over complicate things further when creating a product to take on the competitors including its own product.'
