A New York home has set the world record for having the most number of Christmas lights - a blinding 601,736 spread of bulbs spanning two acres.

Timothy Gay from Lagrangeville started putting up festive decorations when his daughter was born in 1995 in a bid to 'make the holidays special'.

Over the past 19 years he has continued adding to the dazzling display, and this season he made it into the record books.

Obsession: Timothy Gay from Lagrangeville, New York, started putting up Chistmas lights on his home following the birth of his first daughter

Record-breaking: Over the past 19 years he has continued adding to the dazzling display, and this season he made it into the record books with a blinding 601,736 spread of bulbs spanning two acres

The full-time engineer, his wife, Grace, and their three children, Emily, Daniel and John, met with an official adjudicator earlier this month.

For the record to be set, the lights had to be turned on in the dark for ten minutes with all of the bulbs functioning. 

'I started with 600 lights and here we are now with 1,000 times that,' Mr Gay said.

His light show consists of twinkling garden ornaments in all the colors of the rainbow. Standout features include giant trees, over-sized hearts and dangling stars.

Mr Gay's red brick house is barely visible through the mass of decoration. 

This year's display took him around two months to build.

He also syncs the lights to music and over the years he has wired bulbs up to more than 200 tracks. Some songs can take up to 35 hours to program.  

Mr Gay actually won the world record for 'Most Lights on a Residential Property' in 2012  but lost the title  the following year.

The Richards family of Canberra, Australia, outdid him with an illumination boasting 502,165 lights.

However, Mr Gay managed to reclaim the top spot in 2014 thanks to a donation from Ritz Crackers.

Commenting on the win, the father-of-three said: 'My family and I are thrilled to bring the world record back to the U.S. and we're even more excited that we did it with nearly 100,000 more lights than the previous record.'

The Gay's light display is open to the public daily until December 29, with donations going to charity. The family expect to raise $30,000 this holiday season.
