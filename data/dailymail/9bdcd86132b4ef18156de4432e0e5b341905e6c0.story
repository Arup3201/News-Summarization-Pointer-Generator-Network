Charged: Doctor Ali Salim, pictured, is charged with murdering pregnant mother of two, Deanna Ballman, after she responded to a Craigslist ad

An Ohio doctor who is suspected of raping and killing a pregnant mother of two last summer has been linked to two earlier incidents involving one woman who accused him of sexual assault, and another who claimed that he accosted her.

Pakistani-born Dr Ali Salim is accused of murdering Deanna Ballman, of Pataskala, and her unborn baby last July by injecting her with a lethal dose of heroin and then doing 'inhumane' things to her corpse.

Ballman, who was nine-months pregnant and had two kids at home, was found dead in the backseat of her car in woods outside of New Albany on August 1.

Salim, 44, pleaded not guilty in February to two counts of murder as well as rape, felonious assault, corrupting another with drugs, kidnapping, tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse.

He remains on house arrest on $1million bond. His trial is scheduled for Sept. 3.

Salim's life was full of drama in the months before his encounter with Ballman, according to police records obtained by the AP, prosecutors' statements and interviews with Delaware County sheriff's investigators.

In September 2010, Salim told police his house had been burglarized with the help of a female heroin addict he'd been trying to help get treatment.

He refused to cooperate with investigators despite losing three TVs, two laptops, $500 in cash and credit cards, and the case was placed on inactive status, according to a Columbus police report.

In April 2011, a woman who answered 
one of Salim's Craigslist ads called 911 to report an assault at Salim's
address. ‘I came to a gentleman's house, and he accosted me,’ she said.

Eight months later, in early 
December, aspiring model Gabrielle Roush answered what she thought was a
legitimate modeling ad: $400 to let Salim paint the human digestive 
system on her abdomen for what he said was a work assignment.

But Roush, accompanied by her future 
father-in-law, turned down the job after Salim insisted she be in the 
house alone while he worked.

‘He said, "As long as you don't cause
drama, you can do this for me,"' recalled Roush, 21, a college student 
in Columbus, whose meeting with Salim and call to police came long 
before Ballman's death and Salim's arrest.

The following July, a woman was 
sexually assaulted at Salim's house, according to a report she filed 
with police a month later, after Ballman's death.

According to Ballman's family, the 
woman was responding to a housecleaning ad and called to say she wasn't 
feeling well, which was the last they heard of her.

However, reports suggest she may have met with Salim after he put a call out for models.

Salim has been at the center of the investigation into Ballman's death for months, with 10TV reporting in September that investigators had searched the doctor's Ohio home and removed a laptop, camera and other items.

Assistant county prosecutor Kyle Rohrer 
said Salim treated Ballman's body 'in a very inhumane way,' but wouldn't
elaborate on how.

Prosecutors believe the doctor, who has gone by the cyber handle 'extremephotoenthusias,' has sought out other women through Craigslist.

Rohrer said other women had responded to ads placed by Salim, including one woman who said Salim wanted to paint the digestive system on her abdomen.

According to an email obtained by 10TV in September the doctor wrote that he was willing to pay $300 if young women can keep their work 'drama free,' adding 'I just don't need the drama.'

He also told women that they could 'wear
anything but black or brown bra, and panties are essential. I will take
most shots from the back.'

Salim, who is single, is originally from Pakistan where he earned his medical degree at King Edward Medical College at the University of the Punjab in 1993, according to Ohio medical board records. He did his residency at West Virginia University and worked most recently as an emergency room physician in Mt. Vernon, a small city in east-central Ohio.

The Ohio medical board has revoked Salim's license because of the criminal charges. He had no medical disciplinary cases as a doctor and no previous criminal record. He is a permanent U.S. resident with a green card.

He lived in a $305,000 house in New Albany, a tony Columbus suburb, and owned expensive cars, including a Porsche and Infiniti. He drove his vehicles fast: Records obtained by The Associated Press found at least 15 speeding tickets since 2000.

Ballman, 23, was a supply specialist with a National Guard military police unit in Colorado who had just moved back to Ohio after separating from her husband. She had her own apartment east of Columbus and was still trying to buy furniture for her children's bedrooms.

The family reported her missing July 31, telling police about the housecleaning ad. At 3.30pm that day, Deanna Ballman called her mother, Lori Ballman.

‘Deanna stated that she felt dizzy and did not feel well. Deanna then stopped talking. Lori stated a male with a foreign accent then got on the phone asking what he could do to help. The call was then lost,’ according to the missing-person's report.

Mother's anguish: Lori Ballman was the last person to hear from her daughter, Deanna, a supply specialist with the National Guard, before the pregnant 23-year-old mother of two turned out dead from a heroin overdose

Lori Ballman also told investigators she heard the sound of a woman's voice in the background speaking another language. Investigators say they've never located this person. O'Brien, the Delaware County prosecutor, says it's not clear how Deanna Ballman's car got to the country road.Compounding the family's struggle, Ballman's 19-year-old brother, James, died in an accidental shooting in February.

Deanna Ballman's children are in foster care in Colorado, her mother said. Ballman was a high school graduate and devoted mother who hoped eventually to go to college to be a dentist, her mother said.

Lori Ballman helped her daughter gather cleaning supplies the day she disappeared, but she believes now that was a cover story for something darker she can't quite bring herself to name.‘That's the only reason I can think she told me she was going housecleaning, because she was humiliated,’ Ballman said.

Salim's lawyer, Sam Shamansky bluntly called Ballman an ‘unfortunate victim’ who died as a result of prostituting herself to feed a drug habit.

‘Regrettably, she caused her own demise and Dr. Salim had nothing to do with it,’ said attorney Sam Shamansky.

The rape charge against Salim alleges
he assaulted her knowing her ability to resist ‘was substantially 
impaired.’ Capt. Kevin Savage of the Delaware County Sheriff's Office 
says there's no evidence Ballman was a drug addict.

But, like the prosecutor, he hints that Ballman's reasons for going to Salim's home have yet to come out.

‘I
don't think she knew she was going to be overdosed with heroin and 
subsequently die, but I think she knew what she was responding to,’ 
Savage said.

Ballman died 
of a heroin overdose but also had morphine and codine in her blood at 
the time of her death and her urine contained morphine, 
monoacetylmorphine, codeine, acetylocodine and diacetylmorphine.

When
asked if Ballman was responding to a housecleaning ad before she was 
killed, Delaware County Prosecutor Carol O'Brien said on Thursday 
'that's not quite what we've found.'

Rohrer said Salim tried to tamper with evidence and would be a flight risk once he learns that investigators recovered it.

'We believe this is not an isolated 
incident and that he remains a threat to others in the public if he's 
released,' Rohrer said.

O'Brien declined to elaborate after the hearing on what exactly Salim is accused of doing to Ballman's corpse.

Salim's
attorney said he has represented Salim since last summer and throughout
the investigation, including a meeting with investigators in October 
where Salim provided hair samples.
