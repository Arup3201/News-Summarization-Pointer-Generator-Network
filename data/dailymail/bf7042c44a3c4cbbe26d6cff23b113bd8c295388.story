Richard Hannon believes the light campaign Toronado has had in Europe will be key in Saturday's Breeders’ Cup Mile as he bids to end a dream debut season as a trainer in style.

Hannon had a hard act to follow taking over from his five-time champion father, Richard Snr. Being handed control of one of the most powerful yards in the land has obvious advantages but his son has taken it to new heights.

He is champion trainer with prize-money of almost £4.7million, a total his father never reached.

Trainer Richarde Hannon and jockey Richard Hughes (R) are looking to cap off an exceptional season

There has been a first Classic from Night Of Thunder in the 2,000 Guineas, plus four other Group One victories including Toronado in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot. With Richard Hughes on board a Breeders’ Cup success, worth more than £650,000, would also outstrip his father, who does not have fond memories of America’s biggest meeting.

Paco Boy’s fourth in the 2010 Mile was the best he achieved from nine starters, a record which also included the fatal fall of Mr Brooks in the 1992 Sprint and a nightmare run which deprived Sky Lantern probable victory in the 2011 Juvenile Fillies’ Turf.

Hannon Jnr said: ‘You still need a fresh horse to beat the Americans in their own back yard and in Toronado we have just that. This has been the plan since Royal Ascot. Provided Hughesie can get him into a good early rhythm from what is a decent draw (in stall five), he ought to go very close.’

In the absence of injured dual Mile winner Wise Dan and Toronado’s Sussex Stakes conqueror Kingman, Hannon’s hope, who is racing for only the fourth time this year, is 2-1 favourite with Coral.

The field also includes David Simcock’s Woodbine Mile winner Trade Storm and Dermot Weld’s Jersey Stakes winner Mustajeeb plus Veda, Karakontie and Anodin from France.

Jamie Osborne’s Toast Of New York attempts to become only the second European horse to win the $5m Classic when it has been run on dirt.

But he is up against unbeaten Shared Belief, who comprehensively beat him in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar, and Kentucky Derby hero California Chrome.
