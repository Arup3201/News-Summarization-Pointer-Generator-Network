Mr Sarkozy was invited to the grand eighteenth century residence several times by Mr Chancel in the early 2000s, and the pair were pictured attending social events together around the same time.

He lead tributes to Mr Chancel on the day of his death, telling Le Point: 'Jacques Chancel was a man of immense culture. I cannot name a single subject that did not know passionately.

'This is a man who never said ill of anyone. He preferred to see rather than criticize. He loved life passionately. His was full of discoveries, love for others, joy of living, and of great humility.

'France has lost a great man of television. Culture has lost one of its best servants. And we all lose a friend whose loyalty never faltered.  It is a sad day for us all.'

Mr Sarkozy has been back in the political spotlight recently after winning back the leadership of his Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) party late in November.

The seasoned politician, who served as President of France from 2007 to 2012, is preparing to run for the top job again in 2017 in the hopes of deposing Francoise Hollande, who is the country's most unpopular leader ever.

The UMP, which has struggled to be effective in opposition to Mr Hollande, will choose its presidential nominee in 2016. 

His main contender will be far-right campaigner Marine Le Pen and the National Front party who have taken scalps in local elections across the country.

In the past he has accused Hollande's socialist party of 'ruining France', but said voters need a genuine alternative to Le Pen's movement.

Mr Chancel was born on July 2, 1928, at his parent's home in the Hautes-Pyrénées mountains. He later bought an eighteenth century castle there, where his body will be interred on Thursday

Mr Chancel presented long-running series Radioscopie and Le Grand Echiquier and was a good friend of Mr Sarkozy, who he invited to his palatial home in the early 2000s

He was pictured today alongside Carla Bruni, the former supermodel who he wed in 2008, and now has a young daughter with.

Mr Chancel, whose real name is Joseph Cramps, was born on July 2, 1928, in the French mountain town of Ayzac-Ost, in the Hautes-Pyrénées, where he would later buy an eighteenth century castle.

He was a stalwart of French broadcasting, presenting long-running series Radioscopie and Le Grand Echiquier, for which he was best known.
