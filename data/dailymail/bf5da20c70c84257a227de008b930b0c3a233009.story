The mother of killer Dale Cregan had her house bugged by police who listened to her for up to 24 hours a day while her son was on the run.

Manchester Crown Court heard while officers were hunting for Cregan, who was wanted for the murders of father and son David and Mark Short, they were eavesdropping on Anita Cregan. 

Kathryn Smith, 25, of Droylsden, a 
senior police officer's daughter, is alleged to have leaked the information using her job as a call handler at GMP’s Trafford 
communications room.

Between August 23 and September 19 last 
year, officers recorded hours of conversations between Anita Cregan and 
her family and friends at her Droylsden home.

The round-the-clock surveillance captured Mrs Cregan insisting that she did not know where her son was in the hours after armed police raided her house after a tip-off from a local man who reported a 'suspicious' car to police.

The recording taken in the Cregan home taped Anita saying that ‘25 officers’ with ‘big Alsatians’ had hammered down the door in the early hours of August 29 as a helicopter hovered above.

A car, that had been reported minutes earlier by a local man, contained food wrappers and camping gear and belonged to Cregan’s sister, Kelly Cregan, who police arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender, but later released without charge.

Anita Cregan describes herself as ‘f****** fuming’ at the course of events, and sets out to identify the ‘grass’, saying ‘I can’t sit on it...I’m really not the type of person who can sit on that.’

In conversations with friends and neighbours, she dismisses the raid as a ‘wild goose chase’, saying: 'They think I know where (Dale Cregan) is, but this is the longest time in my life that I’ve not spoke to him. I have never not spoken to him for this time, even when he goes on holiday he rings me.'

Following her release from the cells, Kelly Cregan can be heard describing her brother as ‘the most wanted man in Britain’.

Anita Cregan, 56, is on trial accused of procuring information from a police worker which enabled her to identify and confront the man whose call prompted the raid.

The recordings made while her home was bugged include her vowing to identify the ‘grass’ who she believes has betrayed her for a ‘fifty grand’ reward.

It even captures her receiving the text that allegedly confirmed the identity of who it was that tipped off the police – and her anger and disbelief as she is taped saying ‘I can’t believe it...(it is) one of my friends’.

The Manchester Evening News reports the man identified as the 'grass' is then questioned for six hours, until 6am on September 1, by Anita Cregan.

Sobbing at times, the man, who was later warned by police his life could be at risk, insists that he feared the car belonged to someone seeking reprials against the Cregans.

Mrs Cregan tells him: 'I know somebody who knows somebody who knows somebody. I have got inside information right? I have got a bit of inside.'

Information is said to have been provided to her by Sean Booth, a 31-year-old neighbour who she describes as ‘like a brother’ to Dale Cregan on the secret police tapes.

Booth and Mrs Cregan, both of Droylsden, both deny aiding and abetting misconduct in public office.

Booth’s girlfriend, Kathryn Smith, 25, of Droylsden, a senior police officer's daughter, is alleged to have leaked the information using her job as a call handler at GMP’s Trafford communications room.

She denies misconduct in public office in the same Manchester Crown Court trial.

Speaking of the bugging operation, Dc Michael Young told court: 'The listening post was manned from 7am in the morning until the early hours of the following day, through the entire duration. Sometimes it was up to 24 hours.'

The trial continues.
