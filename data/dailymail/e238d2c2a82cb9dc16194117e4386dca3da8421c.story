Ignore your friggatriskaidekaphobia! (that's fear of Friday 13th)  - you'll be saving yourself at least £50 if you fly tomorrow.

Superstitious Brits, wary of Friday 13th, are so keen to avoid flying on that day that airlines across the board have dropped their prices.

Data from travel search engine KAYAK reveals that Friday 13th is the cheapest day to fly in June, with domestic UK flights coming in at £52 less than the monthly average this Friday.

Get lucky: Keep those fears at bay on Friday 13th and you'll get cheaper flights

Traditionally feared as a day of accidents and mishaps, there is only one Friday 13th this year and the superstition has driven down flight prices across the board, allowing non-superstitious travellers to reap the benefits. 

Domestic UK return flights in June have an average price of £233, but on Friday 13th a lack of demand has slashed the average price down to £181, making it the cheapest day to travel in the entire month. 

Prices and demand for domestic return flights have been drawn from Kayak searches to determine if friggatriskaidekaphobia - or fear of Friday the 13th - is affecting consumer travel behaviour.  

Fingers crossed! Friday 13th is lucky for some

It is not only UK travellers who are afflicted by this fear: domestic flights in France, Austria and Sweden are also at their lowest price of the month this Friday.

The firm's travel data shows that the superstition has reduced prices £53 below the monthly average in France.

Prices are down by £24 in Austria, and the worrisome Swedes have caused a huge drop of £89.

'It is fascinating to see just how much the concern caused by Friday 13th is affecting consumer travel behaviour,' says KAYAK Managing Director Annie Wilson.

'For flight prices to be noticeably lower than the monthly average implies that people really are taking the connotations of the date into consideration when booking.

'The savvier option is to put aside superstition and snap up a bargain flight while others are battening down the hatches and waiting for the day to pass.'
