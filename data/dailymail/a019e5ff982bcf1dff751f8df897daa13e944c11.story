A Darwin woman has been receiving death threats after starting a crocodile conservation group.

The woman, who wants to be known only by her nickname of 'Broady', started the NT Crocodile Conservation & Protection Society last week after reports the Northern Territory government is considering a crocodile cull in response to a fatal crocodile attack earlier this month.

Within 24 hours of starting the group, the mother-of-one, who works in the crocodile industry, had received five death threats via Facebook.

'Three were insinuations that I should go for a swim with the crocodiles, that sort of thing. Another guy told me if he saw me on the river he'd capsize my boat,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

Broady believes the threats came from 'fishermen with bees in their bonnets' and said while they were unpleasant, she is unfazed by their comments.

'It didn't scare me, it didn't deter me, all it did was p*** me off and make me want to fight harder.'

Bob Irwin, the father of Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin, who gave his support to the newly-founded society, said he had received threats over the forty years he has been working in environmental conservation, but added that 'death threats or any threats of physical violence are totally out of order'.

'The problem here in Australia is, we’ve got very very few predatory animals and we don’t seem to give them the just recognition they deserve, they are really important to the health of our environment. We have to look after our predatory animals the same as we do any fluffy furry koala,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'I’m just really pleased we have a group of young Australians in the Northern Territory who are prepared to get out there,' he said.

Mr Irwin added that the group was 'very brave' and would 'cop a bit of flak' because 'when it comes to crocodiles you do get people with very strong views indeed.'

Broady started the conservation group after a famous crocodile 'Michael Jackson' was shot and killed for fatally attacking a fisherman on the Adelaide River

Broady was motivated to start the conservation group after a popular Northern Territory crocodile, Michael Jackson, was shot and killed for attacking a local fisherman. Tran Van Lanh, 57, was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the Adelaide River on August 18.

After the death, the 4.5 metre crocodile, who had a distinctive white head, was killed by authorities so Mr Lanh's remains could be recovered.

Broady describes Michael Jackson, who was pied leucistic, meaning he had pigmentation on his body but an albino head, as 'very dear to my heart'.

'I lived on the Adelaide River and he used to sit outside my house. I used to watch him while I did the dishes,' she said.

'He was so genetically rare, he was one in a million, he was so amazing… Generally [leucistic crocodiles] are attacked quite aggressively by other crocodiles and birds, so to get him out in the wild to the size he was, was a miracle.'

Broady started a petition for Michael Jackson to be captured and have his stomach pumped, rather than be killed, and had even lined up a buyer in the U.S. willing to pay several hundred thousand dollars for the crocodile, but her campaign was unsuccessful.

The society started by Broady aims to give a voice to those who are concerned about crocodile culls and trophy-hunting and she is hoping they will be able to achieve non-profit status.

'We're not out there to say all the fishermen are bad. It's about finding common ground and finding a solution that works for everyone.'

'Croc selfies', featuring people posing in front of or on top of crocodile traps in the Northern Territory have drawn strong criticism

Chief Minister Adam Giles said the death of Mr Lanh two weeks ago was 'a sign that the density and population of crocs in the NT is becoming somewhat of an issue' and that the cabinet would consider culling as a long-term policy as well as safari hunting.

'It's not about going out and randomly killing crocs, it's about having a well-developed plan that protects the interests of the animal but also the interests of the general public,' Mr Giles said.

Adam Britton, Senior Research Associate at Charles Darwin University, says that while there are significantly more crocodiles in the Northern Territory waters than there used to be, the crocodile population is merely returning to its natural levels.

Saltwater crocodiles were almost driven to extinction by hunting in the 1960s and it is estimated their population dropped to about 3,000. Now, there are approximately 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory, the result of a management program that was put in place in 1971.

Mr Britton says the management program has been doing 'an excellent job' of restoring the ecological balance that was threatened by the low numbers of crocodiles and said that since they have increased in number, crocodiles have become a significant economic asset for the Northern Territory as well.

In the 1970s, the saltwater crocodile population dropped to 3,000 due to excessive hunting.

A management program was implemented to restore their numbers, which involved protecting the species.

Now there are an estimated 100,000 saltwater crocodiles in the Northern Territory.

On average crocodiles kill one person every two years in Australia.

This year, four people have died in crocodile attacks in the Northern Territory.

Tran Van Lanh, 57, was killed by the crocodile in front of his wife while fishing in the Adelaide River on August 18.

The remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin earlier this month.

In June a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in Kakadu National Park.

In January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends at a billabong in Kakadu.

'Some vocal people believe they should be curbed and the question has to be looked at very carefully... I don’t think it’s going to achieve anything close to what people are hoping it will achieve, it will reverse the progress we’ve seen with crocodiles over the last few decades.

'It will affect a significant number of people without necessarily saving any lives,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

Mr Britton added that having a large cull of crocodiles in the state would be 'folly'.

'If the NT government said: "It's open season on crocodiles and we're going to remove 50,000 crocs from the wild", there would be some fairly serious repercussions of the way people see Australia.'

Mr Britton said that according to statistics one person is killed by crocodiles in the country every two years, but there has been a 'cluster' of deaths in recent months.

As well as the crocodile attack that claimed Mr Lanh, there have been three other deaths in the Northern Territory from crocodile attacks so far this year.

Earlier in August the remains of 22-year-old Travis Costa were found inside a saltwater crocodile in Tiwi Islands north of Darwin; a 62-year-old man was snatched by a large crocodile from a boat moored in Kakadu National Park in June and in January a 12-year-old Aboriginal boy was killed by a crocodile while swimming with friends, also at Kakadu.

Mr Britton said it was too early to tell if the deaths were a trend or a statistical 'blip' and said it was more helpful to compare the number of crocodile fatalities in Australia with those in surrounding countries, where fatalities from crocodile attacks were much more common, despite smaller populations of the animals.

Mr Britton added that while he is not in favour of a large-scale cull of the animals, he does think it is necessary to kills crocodiles who attack humans.

'I think it's an unfortunate necessity in most situations if a crocodile has killed someone, that crocodile has learned that it can successfully attack and kill someone at that location, that makes it incredibly dangerous. I would rather see that crocodile killed and removed from the system,' he said.

He added that in the case of Michael Jackson it was 'unfortunate' because he was a very popular animal, but that considering he lived right next to a busy boat ramp 'it would have been madness' to let him live after he had successfully killed a human.
