It is rumoured that Apple’s iPhone 6 will feature a virtually indestructible screen made of sapphire.

And now the eagerly-anticipated handset’s screen is said to be about to enter large-scale production later this month.

To create enough of the man-made sapphire material, which will make screens that are scratch-resistant and flexible, Apple struck a deal with GT Advanced Technologies in Mesa, Arizona.

The iPhone 6's sapphire screen is rumoured to be going into large scale production this month. Here, one of the screens is repeatedly stabbed by a knife and emerges unscathed from the video trial which also sees in being bent and scratched with keys

Synthetic sapphire is a hard, transparent material made of crystallising aluminium oxide, produced at high temperatures.

As
 the material is heated, it forms disks that can be sliced 
using diamond-coated saws.

These round disks are ground into shape, and 
polished, to become glass.

The technology is traditionally used in watch displays because it is thin, super-strong and scratch resistant.

Apple already uses sapphire crystal in 
the Touch ID fingerprint scanner on its latest iPhone 5S and to protects the phone's camera.

As a result, sapphire glass could potentially replace Gorilla Glass currently used in most high-end smartphones.

The
 sapphire material will be manufactured at a plant powered by renewable 
energy, which has been built as part of the $578million (£350million) arrangement, The Guardian reported.

It
 is claimed to be composed of thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the 
material to be flexible - giving it a change of withstanding knocks and 
falls that shatter other types of toughened glass.

A YouTube videomaker recently claimed 
to have acquired one of the screens - and subjected it to a barrage 
of abuse, from stabbing it with a knife and keys to bending and twisting
 it.

In the video, the screen emerges totally unscathed - raising hopes is could lead to a far more resilient handset from Apple.

Marques Brownlee, a popular YouTube host claimed last month to have got the screen from well-known Apple leaker Sonny Dickson, who recently made his own video showcasing the screen.

In the video, Mr Brownlee can be seen bending and twisting the screen.

'I slowly realised there is absolutely no way I can break this display under my own power,' he said.

'The worst blemish on the surface was actually my fingerprint marks and the dust from handling it so much.'

The glass is also extremely high-quality, Mr Brownlee noted: 'There’s absolutely no colour shift while looking through the sapphire glass.'

Apple already uses a small amount of sapphire glass for the 'Home' button and camera lens in the iPhone 5S, but the rest of the current iPhone front display is made of Gorilla Glass.

The new glass display is 'paper thin,' Mr Brownlee said in his video.

He showed that his screen measures 4.7 inches diagonally, which is in keeping with rumours that Apple will release two different-sized iPhones this year: A 4.7-inch model and 5.5-inch one.

Reports claiming that Apple was experimenting with sapphire displays began last year, yet sources claimed at the time that Apple found the technology ‘infeasible.’

In the video, Marques Brownlee stands on the thin screen and bends it. When released, it goes back it its normal shape, raising hopes the new handset will have an almost indestructible screen

The screen is also shown being repeatedly stabbed by a knife - and emerging with no scratches, although it has not been confirmed to be the 'official' screen that will feature in the new handset

This was because sapphire glass is more expensive to produce than normal screens.

But it appears that the sapphire screens will soon be manufactured at GT Advanced Technologies' new facility, which is expected to employ around 700 people.

An Apple spokesman previously said: 'We are proud to
 expand our domestic manufacturing initiative with a new facility in 
Arizona, creating more than 2,000 jobs in engineering, manufacturing and
 construction.'

‘This new plant will make components 
for Apple products and it will run on 100 per cent renewable energy from
 day one, as a result of the work we are doing with SRP to create green 
energy sources to power the facility.’

Last month, iPhone maker Foxconn revealed Apple's new iPhone 6 could be the first to be made using its 'robot army'.

The screen is described as 'paper thin'. It is claimed to be made from thin man-made layers of sapphire, which enables the material to be flexible, giving it a change of withstanding knocks and falls that shatter other types of toughened glass

In the video, the screen survived having keys scratched across its surface - a common problem for iPhone owners who keep their handsets in their pocket

The firm has pledged to have a million robot workers by the end of the year - and CEO Terry Gou  revealed the robots, dubbed 'Foxbots', are in the final stages of testing.

It is believed Foxconn will install 10,000 robots as a test and that lines dedicated to Apple devices will get first priority, according to IT Home.

The
 website says Gou told a shareholder meeting that Apple would be the 
first company to take advantage of the new robot workers meaning that 
its next product - the iPhone 6 - will be manufactured in this way.

Each $25,000 (£14,945) Foxbot can complete an average of 30,000 devices per year, it has been claimed.

Workers are seen inside a Foxconn factory in the township of Longhua in the southern Guangdong province. The firm is believed to be installing thousands of robots to help build Apple's latest iPhone

Foxconn currently employs more than 1.2 million workers at its various factories across China and is said to be ramping up the number of human workers needed for the launch of the iPhone 6, with 100,000 being hired according to some reports.

In a bid to make sure there will be enough iPhone 6 handsets to meet demand, Apple has ordered a first batch of between 70 million and 80 million handsets, The Wall Street Journal reported.

This would be its largest first production run ever and handsets would be expected to reach customers by Christmas.

Dozens of pictures have leaked online claiming to show Apple's iPhone 6. They all show a thin, curved device with distinctive white 'bars' across the back.

However,
 a Japanese news agency has claimed that in fact, the finished product 
will look very different - and that it could even have a curved screen.

Prolific Apple-tipster, Sonny Dickson, has got his hands on leaked images of the front and back of a possible Apple LCD backlight panel that measures 5.5 inches (14cm). The photos suggest Apple is already producing components for its anticipated 5.5-inch phone
