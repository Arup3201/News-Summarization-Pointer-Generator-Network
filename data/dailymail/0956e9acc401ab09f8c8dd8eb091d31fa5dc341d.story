Miranda Kerr is the latest in a long line of Western celebrities to feature in bizarre Japanese advertisements.

After flogging Lipton Limone ice tea in a yellow mini dress late last year, the Australian beauty, 30, is now seen starring in a series of cartoon-inspired adverts for Japanese P&G product Bold laundry detergent.

Playing the role of perfect housewife, Miranda strolls through a supermarket with a trolley stacked full of 'Fundry' detergent, to the awe and admiration of female Japanese shoppers.

As well as looking gorgeous the ex-Victoria's Secret angel even speaks some Japanese in the advert telling viewers about the pink product.

Miranda Kerr replaces Cameron Yamada, the previous Bold spokesperson, reports Michelle Lynn Dinh of Rocket News 24. Miranda is even introduced as 'New Yamada-san' at the beginning of her Bold commercial.

As she steps out of her car, a mountain of Bold detergent is seen cascading into the driver’s seat. A surprised Miranda looks back and smiles.

From there, Miranda’s curious neighbors pop over to find out what’s going on.

They all have a conversation in Japanese about the detergent.

The video shoot reportedly took place in Los Angeles, California, but the advert will never be seen on any TV in the UK or America. Kerr fans can catch a glimpse of Miranda's Bold adverts on YouTube, though.

Leonardo Di Caprio, David Beckham and 
Brad Pitt have all starred in bizarre Japanese commercials.

Even 
fictional American actor Joey from Friends flogged a strange blue make-up product dubbed Ichiban, lipstick for
men.
