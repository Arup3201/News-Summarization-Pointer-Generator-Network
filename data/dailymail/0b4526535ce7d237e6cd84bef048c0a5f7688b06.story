A Danish man has come forward and claimed he worked with the CIA to infiltrate al-Qaeda as a double agent and provided vital information on radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki that led to the wanted terrorist being killed in an American drone strike.

The man, Morten Storm, who has come forward to Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten has said that he was a former Islamic supremacist before the Danish intelligence service PET convinced him to change sides and work for them and eventually the American CIA.

Storm has claimed that he became so deeply trusted by Anwar al-Awlaki, that U.S. president Barack Obama knew his name and that it was him who delivered a USB stick the American's used to track al-Awlaki to a convoy which they destroyed in Yemen in September 2011.

Morten Storm has come forward to claim that he was an al-Qaeda double agent and helped the CIA track down and kill Anwar al-Awlaki, a top figure in the terror group

In evidence presented to Jyllands-Posten, Storm handed over alleged letters between himself al-Awlaki, collected during the six-years he worked with the Danish and U.S. intelligence services.

In addition, Storm played the Danish newspaper, itself the subject of a major controversy concerning cartoons that depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2005-06, an alleged conversation between himself, PET agents and a lone CIA officer in an upmarket Danish hotel.

During the audio recording the CIA agent, identified only as Michael, confirms that Storm worked for the PET and CIA and adds that President Obama is aware of the operation.

However, contrary to his assertion, the alleged CIA officer tells Storm during the recorded conversation that al-Awlaki was killed thanks to another mission and not because of the Danes work.

Storm told the newspaper that he suffered a troubled childhood, drifting through drugs and into crime.

In 1997, the Dane said that he converted in prison to Islam and upon leaving moved to Yemen to study the Koran.

He added that in 2000 he married a Yemeni with whom he had a son named Osama with.

According to the newspaper report, in 2006, he had a dramatic and unexplained change of heart and was turned double agent by the Danish intelligence service, PET.

After five years, Storm claimed to have worked his way to the top of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's inner circle and gained direct access to al-Awlaki.

In a statement issued in response to the story, the Danish spy organisation said that as a matter of policy it does not publicly confirm sensitive information about its past, current or future operations, not does it deny incorrect information.

'It should be noted, however, that in no way does PET engage in or support operations aimed at taking civilian lives,' said the statement.

'Consequently, PET has not contributed in connection to the military operation that led to the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen.'

US President Barack Obama and Defense Secretary and former head of the CIA| Leon Panetta were allegedly aware of Morten Storm existence claims the Danish man

The CIA did not offer a comment on the story to ABC News, and the White House did not issue a statement either.

Coming forward only now, Storm told Jyllands-Posten that he was doing so because he was proud of what he had acheived and wanted recognition for turning his life around.

Anwar al-Awlaki died on September 30th, 2011 in a drone attack in Yemen.

The New-Mexico born terrorist had become the lead figure for al-Qaeda and the offshoot al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in the years after Osama bin Laden went into enforced hiding.

With is fluent command of English, al-Awlaki was responsible for the terrorist groups 'Inspire' online magazine which famously taught readers how 'to make a bomb in your mother's kitchen.'

Before his death he was considered responsible for persuading Nigerian terrorist Omar Farouk Abdulmuttalab to hide explosives in his underwear which he tried to use to blow up a Detroit bound plane on December 25th, 2009.

Jyllands-Posten was the subject of a major controversy regarding cartoons that depicted the Islamic prophet Muhammad in 2005-06 which sparked violent protests around the world

Anwar al-Awlaki was also responsible for sending to two parcel bombs in October 2010 to addresses in Chicago, intended to incite the United State into launching an attack on Yemen and so involving them in a third expensive and divisive regional conflict.

Bruce Riedel, a former CIA officer and contributor to The Daily Beast, said that for the most part, Storm's account seems plausible.

'This story is consistent with how you would infiltrate a terrorist group like al-Qaeda,' Riedel told ABC News.

'You need someone who's a plausible recruit... He's the perfect kind of infiltrator, perfect kind of plant inside of al-Qaeda.'

While all of America's technological lead was important to fight terror, Riedel said that there was no substitute for a man on the ground.

'The drones themselves are amazing technical phenomena, but the information that leads the drones to the target is what really matters,' said Riedel.

'In the end it's human beings and the little technical means they can put on somebody to track them down.'
