Apple is planning to ramp up security on its iCloud service to keep hackers out of user accounts. 

Chief executive Tim Cook made the announcements in the face of the
recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from the online service.

Mr Cook told the Wall Street Journal Apple will aggressively encourage
users to take stricter security measures, and the firm will alert users if someone tries to access their files.

Apple is planning to ramp up security on its iCloud service to keep hackers out of user accounts. Chief executive Tim Cook (pictured) said the firm will now send alerts to users each time someone tries to access and make changes to an iCloud account

These alerts will be sent using email and push notifications each time someone tries to change an account password, restore iCloud
data to a new device, or when a device logs into an account for
the first time.

It is possible for users to enhance the security of their documents by turning off iCloud through Settings > iCloud on their device when they are not using it.

They can also turn on two-step verification for their iCloud account.

The tool prevents people accessing accounts - even if they have the password.

To set up two-step verification, go to My Apple ID.

Select Manage your Apple ID and sign in, then select Password and Security.

Under Two-Step Verification, select Get Started and follow the onscreen instructions.

When a user sets up two-step verification, they register one or more trusted devices.

A trusted device is one that can receive 4-digit verification codes using either SMS or Find My iPhone.

Once enabled, any time a user signs in to manage their Apple ID at My Apple ID, or make an iTunes, App Store, or iBooks Store purchase from a new device, they'll need to verify their identity by entering both their password and a 4-digit verification code.

Apple is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in its
systems' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new iPhone
next week.

'When I step back from this terrible scenario that happened and say what more could we have done, I think about the awareness piece,' Mr Cook said. 

'I think we have a responsibility to ratchet that up. That's not really an engineering thing.'

Cook added that Apple will also broaden its use of the two-factor
authentication security system to avoid future intrusions.

Two-factor authentication requires a user to have two of
three things to access an account.

This can include a password,
a separate four-digit one-time code, or a long access key given
to the user when they signed up for the service.

'The usability battle will always be there but could you
ever imagine using your debit card at an ATM and not entering a
pin? That's two factor, something you have - a card - and something
you know - a pin- and we all get along just fine,' WhiteHat
Security's Matt Johansen told Reuters. 

Following the attack, The Next Web spotted code on software development site Github called iBrute, that would have allowed malicious users to use ‘brute force’ to gain an account’s password on Apple iCloud, and in particular its Find my iPhone service. 

However, after an investigation, Apple said on Tuesday the attacks  on celebrities' iCloud accounts were
individually targeted, and that none of the cases it
investigated had resulted from a breach of its systems.

It is now working with law enforcement to identify the hackers.

The announcement comes in the face of the recent celebrity photo scandal that saw hundreds of images stolen from Apple's iCloud service (pictured). Cook said Apple will also broaden its use of the two-factor authentication security system to avoid future intrusions

Jennifer Lawrence (pictured) was among the 101 celebrities who had their photos stolen from iCloud. She is said to have posted more than 60 nude selfies to the online service 

'We want to do everything we can do to protect our customers, because we are as outraged if not more so than they are,' continued Mr. Cook.

The iCloud service lets users store photos and other
content, and access it from any Apple device. 

Scammers have been taking advantage of the celebrity hacking scandal to trick people into entering their Apple ID and password details into a fake login screen.

Security experts recently discovered emails and text messages that claim to be from Apple, warning users about unauthorised access to their accounts.

The latest threat to people's accounts comes as both the FBI and Apple have said they are investigating the link.

The so-called phishing emails are designed to trick people into offering up their details. 

iCloud secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication (explained above). This suggests the hackers were able to obtain the login credentials of the accounts, and pretend to be the user, in order to bypass this encryption

Apple is said to be moving quickly to restore confidence in itssystems' security ahead of the crucial launch of its new iPhone next week. Shares of the smartphone maker slumped 4 per cent this week (graph pictured) - its worst percentage drop since late-January - as Apple faced scrutiny of its security systems

Apple already offers a high-level of security on its iCloud account. 

The service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the web, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server, and using secure tokens for authentication.

Tim Barajin, a technology analyst with Creative Strategies, told MailOnline: 'Security in the cloud is an issue generally - you have to completely trust Google, Apple, Samsung.

'Apple has some of the most powerful encryption tools out there - which is why they have almost a billion credit cards of file, and nobody had ever got hold of those.'

Shares of the smartphone maker slumped 4 per cent this week - its worst percentage drop since late-January - as Apple faced scrutiny of its security systems. 

The stock lost $3.57 to $99.15, with 94 million shares changing hands, exceeding its 50-day daily moving average of 45.8 million shares traded, and putting it on track for one of its busiest days of the year.
