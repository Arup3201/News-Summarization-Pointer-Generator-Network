Italy's highly-paid footballers are threatening to strike over new taxes being brought in on those earning more than 150,000 euros.

Supercuts brought in by Silvio Berlusconi's government to avert a financial crisis in the country would see a 10 per cent tax hike on Italy's higher earners.

Thousands of villages popular with tourists during the summer months could also virtually disappear after the government announced it cut the cost of bureaucracy by consolidating municipalities with a population of less than 1,000.

That would mean towns including Portofino - a favourite haunt of Hollywood A-Listers Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones - and the Lake Como town of Laglio, where George Clooney has a home, would be legally abolished.

Portofino has a population of only 479 during the winter as tourists travel elsewhere, while Laglio has just 957 people living there.

The proposals have sparked a storm of criticism in Italy as the country attempts to clean up its public finances to avoid becoming the next victim of the debt crisis.

The start of the Serie A - Italy's top football division - is already in jeopardy because of a contract dispute.

Players have threatened to strike if an agreement is not signed before the start of the season on August 27, but the Gazzetta dello Sport has estimated the new 'solidarity tax' would cost teams around 50 million euros each.

AC Milan vice president, Adriano Galliani, said the players should pay, not the clubs.

He told the Corriere della Sella: 'Those making 90,000 euros will have to pay it, I don't see why those who make millions shouldn't do it.

'Otherwise, as far as I'm concerned the players can go on strike for the rest of their lives.'

AC Milan is owned by Prime Minister Berlusconi, whose government approved the measures.

Most top players, especially foreign stars, negotiate their net income upon joining a team, and it is then up to the club to handle their fiscal obligations.

This was allowed under the old collective agreement, but the new one - which has not yet been signed - leaves it up to players alone to pay their taxes.

The conflict between the players and the league has been going on since the last collective agreement expired in June last year.

Two strike dates were set during the last season, both of which were avoided with last-minute verbal agreements.

The supercuts will affect 8,100 municipalities across Italy.

Around 29 of the country's 110 provinces will also disappear, along with more than 50,000 jobs.

The cuts are aimed at saving a total of 45.5 billion euros over the next two years.

Italy's debt in around 120 per cent of its GDP and the cuts aim to balance its budget in 2013.

Other measures in the cuts include raising the pension age for women to 65, more tax on cigarettes and MPs switching to economy flights.

Capital gains tax will also increased from 12.5 per cent to 20 per cent.

The CGILÂ  - Italy's largest trade union - has threatened to call a general strike against the austerity measures.

Susanna Camusso, the union's general secretary, told The Australian: 'Once again it's the weakest who are being hit and those who pay taxes.

'We will confront this budget head on: a general strike.'

It comes as global stock markets 
largely fell as hopes of strong action in the euro zone against the 
escalating sovereign debt crisis faded.

FTSE 100 closed 5331.60, down .49 per cent but lost 0.7 per cent by lunch time to 5,319.12, by which time there had been practically no movement on the Dow, which stood at 11,386.

Stocks
around the world lost headway after Germany announced disappointing 
growth figures of just 0.1 per cent for the second quarter of this year.

There was good news in Belgium, however, after it revealed a 0.7 per cent increase in GDP for the second quarter.

The country has been run by a caretaker government for the last 15 months, meaning it has been unable to enact austerity measures despite a public debt level of nearly 100 per cent of GDP.

Divisions between the Dutch-speaking and francophone regions have blocked the creation of a government since June 2010.

Rudi Thomaes, head of the federation of Belgian enterprises, told the FT: 'Part of the explanation of why the Belgian economy is still strong is that we are late in introducing measures of fiscal consolidation.'
