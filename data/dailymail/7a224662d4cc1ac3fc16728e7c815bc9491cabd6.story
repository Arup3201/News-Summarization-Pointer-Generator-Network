The elaborate tattoo emblazoned across Tom 'Billy' O' Connor's muscular shoulder bears the legend: 'Hung Like A Stallion'.

But while O'Connor, a 34-year-old former porn star from Colchester, might have a manhood worth bragging about now, that wasn't always the case.

Instead he is one of an increasing number of British men opting to go under the knife to enhance their manhood - an operation now so popular, demand has jumped 40 per cent in just one year, according to a leading surgeon.

Demand: Leading plastic surgeon, Dr Roberto Viel, has seen demand leap by 40 per cent

'I know some men – and women – will be amused at what they perceive as self-indulgence,' says  Dr Roberto Viel, who operates on more than 300 men a year in his Harley Street clinic.

'But believe me, large numbers of men reading this will not be laughing – even visiting the gym can cause heartache [for them].'

Dr Viel, who says demand for the procedure has shot up by more than 40 per cent in the last year, isn't the only surgeon to find himself bombarded with applications from men desperate to give their manhood a boost.

Dr Alessandro Littara, a Milan-based surgeon, claimed last year that demand for penis extension surgery among Italian men was shooting up by a record 25 per cent annually, and pinned the blame on the flood of sexualised images that crop up on everything from TV to billboards.

'With everyone seeing images of the body the whole time these days, men are more aware and worried about their bodies,' he told MailOnline.

'All the parts are important and the genitals are no exception. We're living in the age of images, with sexual ones very often on the front page. Sex gets more attention and people feel the need to be more competitive.'

Dr Viel, whose clinic, the London Centre For Aesthetic Surgery, is based on Harley Street, agrees.

'Male models, 
notably David Gandy in the D&G adverts, David Beckham for H&M 
and model Jamie Dornan for Calvin Klein, posing on buses and billboards in tight
 pants that leave little to the imagination drive the trend,' he explains.

'The demand for these 
operations is growing constantly.'

But it isn't all David Beckham's fault. Indeed, as Dr Viel is keen to point out, porn is also behind the increase - not just in penoplasties, but in breast enhancement and labiaplasty surgery as well.

'It is also the same for girls with smaller breasts,' he explains. 'It’s a similar problem. More and more young people are coming here asking for this operation.

'I am here to help the people. I’m here to listen. I’m not here to judge. But the demand is at an all time high.'

For those already in the porn industry such as O' Connell, the pressure to have a large penis is extreme, and as a result, there's little that adult actors won't do to enhance their assets.

'I always had a big one but I wanted a monster,' says O' Connell who had the girth of his penis increased using fat injections.

'Having a big penis is the ultimate - there's no way you could make it in this [porn] industry without it and having surgery helped me get roles every time.' 

O'Connor, who pioneered a sub-genre called Gypsy porn before retiring after meeting the woman he describes as 'the love of my life', describes the sum he paid for the procedure as 'the best money I ever spent'.

But while O'Connor is thrilled, not every penoplasty works out as imagined, with just 35 per cent of men happy with the results, according to the NHS.

That, however, hasn't put men off in the slightest, with many of those who do go under the knife boasting average or large sized penises.

The issue, says Dr Viel, is a lack of self-esteem. 'I always ask why the patient wants the treatment at the beginning 
of the consultation,' he explains.

'Most tell me it's because they lack confidence, have low self-esteem and don’t feel confident enough to show their penis in front of their partner when it's flaccid.

'It’s a lot to do with the way they 
see their own body. If you go to the gym, you don’t need to be an expert 
to see that it's always the man with a big penis who is the one parading around the changing 
rooms with no towel.

'It makes other men, especially those who think they are smaller, feel intimidated and so they cover up. This is every day life.
 If you go to the gym and pay attention to that, you will see it.'

So can plastic surgery really be the answer to this most intimate of dilemmas? The penis extension market is a large and growing one, with hundreds of gizmos marketed to men desperate to give their manhood a boost.

Chop chop: Penis extensions involve cutting the suspensory ligament for an extra one to four inches of length

Prices for penis extending devices can
 be as low as £10 - a far more affordable option than a £6,000 
penoplasty - but Dr Viel says men who try to give their bits a boost 
using a contraption bought online risk wasting their money.

'Unfortunately
 there is no miracle cream to enlarge your penis,' he says. Instead, 
surgery is the only option for those who think themselves small - or 
simply want a boost.

'The majority of clients are average-sized but you get the odd one who is already very well endowed and doesn’t need 
anything but thinks that he wants more,' explains Dr Viel.

'Then there are also men who 
have a real small penis and they need help, yes. Having said that, there's not much difference, mentally, between a man with a real small penis and a man 
with a normal penis who feels small.

'It's clear this 
problem has been neglected by the medical profession for a long time.'

The number of patients asking Dr Viel for a penis extension has increased by 40 per cent in the last 12 months. But what does having a penoplasty really involve? The surgeon talks FEMAIL through the operation.

'There are two ways to enlarge your penis,' explains Dr Viel. 'To lengthen a penis, I look for a ligament that runs from the base of the penis to the pubic bone, which is called the suspensory ligament.

'I cut the ligament where it is attached to the pubic bone and in doing that the penis is released and drops out more – and that is the increase in length.'

For most men, cutting the ligament results in an increase in length of between one and four inches, while Dr Viel's fat injections can increase girth by the same amount.

The extra length, however, only applies to flaccid penises - erect ones remain the same length and tilt upwards at a 90 degree angle.

'I have performed this operation for over 20 years,' adds Dr Viel, 'and I can guarantee that there is no increase in length when erect. If someone claims this is possible, they are wrong.'
