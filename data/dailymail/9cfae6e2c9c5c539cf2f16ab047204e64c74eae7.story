A knife-wielding burglar was brought to justice after he was apprehended by a naked soldier whose door he had smashed in during a riad.

Aaron Brannan already had 19 previous convictions for 28 offences when, with two others, he smashed into the Salford home of Lance Corporal Wayne O’Mahoney.

He was sent to a young offenders’ institution for five years at Manchester Crown Court yesterday after pleading guilty to one count of aggravated burglary.

But the cocky thug gave a thumbs-up gesture to Judge Andrew Blake as he was led from the dock. Lance Corporal O'Mahoney last night slammed the sentence as a joke.

The soldier, who has served in Iraq with the 103 Regiment Royal Artillery, said: 'He smashed into my home at 6am in the morning then threatened me with a knife, causing untold damage.

'He will be laughing in the court’s face with this sentence - and laughing in the face of justice. To me, the sentence is a joke.

'He has made people’s lives a misery and he will only serve half of that sentence. I am really angry. In my eyes, he is laughing at the law.'

The court heard how the soldier, 42, 
was woken by noises in the early hours and leapt out of bed to come 
face-to-face with Brannan at the foot of his stairs.

Brannan and his accomplices had smashed their way through his front door.

But Lance Corporal O'Mahoney fearlessly grabbed a metal bar from a tool box and, with no clothes on, chased the raiders outside.

Brannan, 20, from Higher Broughton, Greater Manchester, then jumped into Lance Corporal O'Mahoney’s girlfriend’s brand new £20,000 Seat Leon after he snatched the keys.

Undeterred, Lance Corporal O'Mahoney smashed the driver’s side window with the bar then reached inside to punch Brannan repeatedly about the head and face.

Brannan produced a nine-inch knife and threatened to stab him but the soldier continued to punch him until he escaped.

He was traced by jewellery that he had stolen during a previous burglary and left in the car. The court was told he also left behind a mobile phone.

Judge Blake told Brannan: 'Over the last four years, you were a prolific offender and you repeatedly attacked people’s houses. This was the worst case of all.

'You threatened the victim because he was being aggressive towards you, not very surprisingly given that you had just battering-rammed his front door.'

The drama - which was captured on CCTV - unfolded on Gerald Road in Charlestown on August 2 last year.

Nichola Carroll, prosecuting, said 
both Lance Corporal O'Mahoney and his partner were asleep at the time. 
She said he heard three loud bangs then ran downstairs to see the men.

Ms
Carroll added: 'He grabbed a metal bar from a tool box and ran after 
them. They ran to the car and the defendant got into the driver’s side.

'The victim, in an attempt to stop the car from being stolen, smashed the driver’s side window with the metal bar.

'He reached into the vehicle and started to punch the defendant in the face.

'The defendant produced a knife from his pocket, brandished it and said ‘I will knife you’. But he continued to punch him and after only a few seconds, the defendant moved over to the passenger side and escaped.'

The court heard Lance Corporal O'Mahoney faced a total damage bill of more than £2,500. The car had only been delivered a day earlier.

Andy McDonald, defending, said: 'The householder put up a robust defence of his property. My client has genuine contrition.'

Lance Corporal O'Mahoney, a former Broughton High pupil, said he would do exactly the same in the same situation and would not hesitate tackling another intruder.

He added: 'The sentence will not teach him anything.'
