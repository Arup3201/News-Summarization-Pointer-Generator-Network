Callum Connolly scored twice as England's Under-18 side showed the future is bright with a 3-1 win over Holland at Bury's JD Stadium.

Chelsea's 16-year-old centre forward Dominic Solanke grabbed the other goal to put a young Oranje side  to the sword on Thursday night - with Alessio da Cruz's strike not proving enough.

Solanke has been earmarked as a future full international by Jose Mourinho and the young striker lived up to his reputation by converting a rebound to win England the game.

The young lions started strong but it took them until three minutes before the break to open the scoring. Liverpool's Sheyi Ojo sent in a corner and after Taylor Moore knocked the ball down Everton academy man Connolly pounced from inside the six-yard box to give England the lead.

Solanke went on to double the lead with the goal that proved to be the winner on 56 minutes. After latching onto Spurs' Josh Onomah's intricate through ball Solanke saw his first strike at goal saved but it wasn't held by Yanick van Osch and Solanke was on hand to convert the rebound.

Alessio da Cruz halved the deficit from 20 yards but it was not enough and Connolly grabbed his second from left-back after Josh Sims ball into the box.

And Connolly could have even had a hat-trick but he was denied by Van Osch in the closing stages.
