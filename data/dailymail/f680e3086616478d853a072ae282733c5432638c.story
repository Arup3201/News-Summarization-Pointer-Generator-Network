Violent crime in a Detroit suburb tripled the year before its local police force was cut in half, stirring up fear among those who live there.

Violent crime in the neighborhood Inkster, which has a population of about 25,000 people, jumped 311 per cent from 2010 to 2011, according to My FOX Detroit.

There have been 10 reported murders in Inkster since July, when its police department was forced to lay off 20 of its 40 or so employees.

Busy place: Detroit's central police station

There have been 12 reported murders in Inkster so far this year.

The latest victim, a man in his thirties, was shot multiple times on a residential street and later died at the hospital.

‘I feel like, personally, the white coats, the men upstairs that make all these megabucks, I feel like our safety is as important as their paychecks,’ one neighborhood resident told CBS Detroit.

Detroit’s own police department has started issuing warnings to those coming in from out of region.

Off-duty cops greeted football fans attending an October Detroit Tigers game with flyers that read: 'Enter Detroit at Your Own Risk -- Detroit is America’s most violent city’.

Part of their incentive was to protest against plans to cut their pay and increase their hours.
