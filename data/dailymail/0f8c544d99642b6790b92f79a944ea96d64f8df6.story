Gabriel Aubry hides under a blanket as he is whisked away from the LAPD's Downtown jail in Los Angeles.

The French-Canadian model, 37, covered his entire body from photographers in the backseat of car after being released from custody on Thursday evening, hour after his shocking Thanksgiving Day brawl with love rival Olivier Martinez.

Bail Bondsman David Perez of David Perez Bail Bonds paid Aubry's $20,000 bail - before picking him up in a white SUV at around 6pm.

Aubry - father of Halle Berry's 
daughter Nahla - was charged with battery and taken into custody upon 
his discharge from hospital at around 3.30pm on Thursday - where he was 
treated for a broken rib and bruises to the face.

His booking sheets lists him as 6ft2 and weighing 180lbs.

The pictures emerged as fresh details of the horrific fight between Aubry and Martinez continued to unravel.

Nahla was apparently saved from 
witnessing the full brutality of the fight - after Halle rushed her 
inside the house as the two men started to face off, TMZ reports.

However it is unclear if she did witness some of the fight.

It
was initially reported the brawl happened inside Halle's house - but it
is now claimed the altercation played out in the large driveway, 
according to the website.

Out and about: Martinez was spotted early on Friday morning visiting a convenience store

After
Olivier said to Gabriel 'We have to move on,' the Canadian model is 
said to have pushed the French actor and tried to punch him before a 
full blown fight broke out.

Gabriel
and Halle - who split in 2010 - have been at odds ever since she tried 
to convince a judge to allow her to move to France with Nahla, a move 
which was recently blocked by the courts.

On
Thursday a judge issued an emergency protective order in the wake of 
the melee - meaning Gabriel must stay 100 yards away from Halle, Olivier
and Nahla.

Onlookers told TMZ the fight was 'brutal', with the website describing a blow-by-blow account of the melee.

A
source said: 'Olivier blocked [Gabriel's punch] and the punch struck 
him in the shoulder instead... Gabriel then pushed Olivier to the 
ground, a struggle ensued, ending when Olivier pinned Gabriel to the 
ground.'

Olivier performed a citizen's arrest on his love rival, before police were called to the scene and arrested Aubry for battery.

Distraction: Halle was seen on Friday arriving at the Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles where she took Nahla to see a show

Business as usual: The actress wore jeans, cardigan and sandals for her outing while Nahla wore pink

Booking sheet: Gabriel Aubry was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of battery and bail was set at $20,000

Meanwhile, Olivier also required hospital treatment - and arrived at the Cedars Sinai Hospital around an hour after Aubry.

The
model-turned-actor was later pictured leaving the hospital, with Halle 
and Nahla in tow, and took the wheel of the car despite sporting a 
swollen hand, which he may have fractured during the fight.

On Friday Olivier was pictured again looking downcast as he headed to a liquor store in Los Angeles.
