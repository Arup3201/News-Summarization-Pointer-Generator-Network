The EU is too busy tackling eurozone economies to help David Cameron claw back powers from Brussels, the French premier Manuel Valls has said

The EU is too busy tackling eurozone economies to help David Cameron claw back powers from Brussels, the French premier said last night.

Mr Cameron has promised tough negotiations to bring about an overhaul of EU rules on free movement, which he says allow thousands of migrants to come here to claim benefits.

But Manuel Valls, the socialist prime minister of France, said in London that the union is too preoccupied with tackling weak growth and high unemployment to overhaul its treaties and change the terms of Britain’s EU membership.

After talks with Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne, he said that opening up the EU treaties would be ‘perilous’ and unpicking the right of free movement of people would be ‘to call into question the very basis of the EU’.

Mr Cameron has pledged to change the rules on free movement ahead of an in/out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017.

Only last week he told the Conservative party conference: ‘I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels. I will not take “no” for an answer when it comes to free movement – I will get what Britain needs.’

Mr Valls, a former interior minister, suggested he was prepared to discuss the conditions for migrants settling in other countries and reducing red tape.

But, speaking to journalists after meeting financiers in the City of London, he added: ‘I don’t think the EU at the moment is ready for a shake-up of its treaties and institutions. The priority is jobs and growth.’

In comments reported in the Financial Times, Mr Valls said unpicking the principle of free movement of people and workers would be ‘to call into question the very basis of the EU’.

He said that in any case, member states from eastern European Europe would oppose it.

A Downing Street spokesman said that at their Number 10 meeting, Mr Cameron had raised freedom of movement with Mr Valls and reiterated his view that ‘this should not be an unqualified right’.

Mr Valls’ visit came as it was claimed that France faces the unprecedented humiliation of having its budget rejected by EU officials because of sky high levels of public borrowing.

Brussels bureaucrats in the European Commission could demand the country tear up and rewrite tax and spending plans for next year to comply with borrowing rules.

Officials are also likely to progress with ‘disciplinary’ action against France which could result in it being fined. The commission could also give France longer to meet budget rules, according to comments from anonymous euro zone officials reported by the news agency Reuters.

It would be the first time the commission had used its power to demand changes to a national budget draft under new powers given to it last year.

One official told Reuters: ‘It would save face for everybody. Even if it would be a bit humiliating for France, they probably know they cannot get away without anything.

‘And it would also save face for Germany and the others, who are concerned about the longer-term effects, about not watering down the rules, but who also want to give France and its unpopular president a fighting chance.’

Sky high levels of unemployment and sclerotic growth have left Socialist President Francois Hollande’s approval rating at an all-time low of 13 per cent.

Once praised by Ed Miliband for his left wing views, President Hollande now faces making embarrassing policy reversals to try and kick start the French economy.

France was supposed to have brought its budget deficit below the EU ceiling of 3 per cent of GDP last year

Last year EU finance ministers gave it a two-year extension, until 2015, because of the continued euro zone recession.

But last month Paris announced it was going to miss the 2015 deadline and would only hit the target by 2017. The commission will consider whether to allow the extended timetable if concessions are made.

Last week the boss of John Lewis was forced into a grovelling apology after describing France as ‘finished’. Managing director Andy Street insisted his tirade against Europe’s second biggest economy had been ‘tongue-in-cheek’ after he described Paris’s Gare du Nord train station as ‘the squalor pit of Europe’ and said even the food and drink in London was better than that he had been offered in Paris.

Speaking in the City of London, Mr Valls tried to put a brave face on his country’s economic woes.

He admitted France needed to follow Britain’s efforts in restoring growth and pledged to cut taxes on growth. But he claimed Britain’s deficit was ‘substantially higher’ than France’s and that Britain was facing the ‘same challenges’ as France.
