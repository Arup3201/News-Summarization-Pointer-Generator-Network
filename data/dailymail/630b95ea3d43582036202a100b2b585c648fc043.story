The petite ballerina who has been comforting Sir Mick Jagger following the suicide of his longtime girlfriend L'Wren Scott cut a solitary figure as she wandered the streets of New York City today.

Melanie Hamrick, 27, was the subject of much conjecture when a picture of her and Jagger embracing on a Zurich balcony just 11 weeks after Scott's death was published.

Scott's family has reacted to the picture with opposing statements. Her sister Jan Shane called Jagger's behavior 'grotesquely disrespectful,' while her brother has said he has nothing but warm regards for the rocker, whose love for his sister he 'never questioned.'

City girl: Hamrick was photographed today as she strode purposefully around New York City

Neighbors: Hamrick lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and L'Wren Scott shared

But
 the images of the great-grandfather being hugged and kissed by Melanie,
 who describes herself as ‘goofy and awkward’, left Ms Scott’s family 
seething.

Speaking from 
her home in Utah, her sister Jan Shane said: ‘These pictures make me 
really wonder what Mick is really thinking and feeling.

‘His daughter says that he is still heartbroken and so devastated about losing my sister – and then you see these photos.

'He will never change. And people wonder why L’Wren was so depressed? The more I think about it – the more angry it makes me.

‘My
 sister deserves so much more respect than that. It hasn’t even been 
three months. I now believe that he was a bigger part of her troubles 
that no one knew about. I am so hurt to know that she was so sad and 
hurting inside and felt that she had nowhere to go.’

Jagger, who along with his Rolling Stones band mates, is due to play the ancient
 Circus Maximus in Rome on June 22, hasn't commented on the relationship
 rumors.

But
 sources close to Jagger said the tryst between Jagger and Hamrick 
followed a chance encounter in a nightclub, but it later transpired that
 they had first met three months earlier in Japan, just two weeks before Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49.

The
 pair didn’t hook up but remained in touch and Melanie ‘reached out and 
they met in New York as friends,’ a source told The Sun following 
Scott’s tragic death.

‘There was a spark there and she provided a distraction to the emotional hell he was going through,’ said the source.

Hamrick, a ballerina with the American Ballet Theater Company, was also spotted alone on the streets of New York earlier in the week.

Meanwhile, Jagger celebrated Father’s Day on Sunday by meeting-up with his ex-wife, and two of their children.

The singer was seen smiling with former partner Jerry Hall, 57, daughter Georgia May, 22, and son Gabriel, 16, as they left a hotel in Vienna, Austria, ahead of a concert the Rolling Stones gave in the city on Monday night.

Jagger's nine-year relationship with Hall ended 15 years ago but the couple, who have four children together, are still close.

It was the rocker's first public appearance since it emerged he met leading ballerina Melanie just two weeks before his girlfriend’s suicide.

On March 6 this year, Melanie and a group of other dancers from the American Ballet Theatre were allowed backstage at the Rolling Stone’s sell-out concert in Tokyo’s Dome stadium to be introduced to Mick and the rest of the band.

Melanie, who is a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, excitedly posted messages and photos of her trip to Japan, but intriguingly, made no mention of the Stones concert.

A spokesman for Jagger has confirmed that the pair met when Melanie and the rest of her group were taken backstage. But a source close to the star stressed that his first liaison with Melanie did not take place until Zurich – and that the pair had merely swapped contact details in Tokyo.

Running errands: Hamrick was dressed casually in jeans and flat shoes as she wandered around Manhattan

The week before the concert, on February
 25, Jagger had attended a special reception for the ballet troupe in 
Tokyo, hosted by U.S. Ambassador Caroline Kennedy, daughter of JFK and a
 long-standing friend of the rock star, but Hamrick did not attend.

She
 lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, just three miles from the 
home on 11th Avenue that Jagger and Ms Scott shared. It was there that Scott took her life on March 17, at the age of 49.

Jagger and Hamrick were pictured on the balcony of his sprawling penthouse at the five-star Dolder Grand Hotel in Zurich earlier this month, looking as though they had just got out of bed.Mick, who himself took up ballet several years ago to keep fit, was in a blue V-necked sweater, while Melanie grinned next to him in a short-sleeved top with slashed sleeves.

During the afternoon he ventured out bare chested and alone, apparently to talk on the phone. Five hours later he was seen wearing a smart, striped shirt and trousers as the dancer stood beside him clutching a glass of water.

Still rocking: The aging lothario, performing June 19 in Dusseldorf, Germany, has apparently kindled a new romance with Hamrick just months after his girlfriend's tragic suicide

Longtime lovers: Jagger and L'Wren Scott had been a couple for more than 10 years when she committed suicide

The following morning they looked more dishevelled as she stole a kiss from him while sat outside the suite.

Jagger was flooded with messages of 
support after Ms Scott, his girlfriend of 13 years, committed suicide 
while he was touring with the Stones in Australia.

Soon
 afterwards, he issued a statement saying: ‘I am still struggling to 
understand how my lover and best friend could end her life in this 
tragic way.

‘We spent many wonderful years together and had made a great life for ourselves... I will never forget her.’

Prima ballerina: Hamrick is a dancer with the American Ballet Theater Company

Since the band resumed the tour following Ms Scott’s death, rumours have been rife the father-of-seven has been entertained by several women after the shows.

Friends claimed Mick, while performing in Berlin last week, spent the night with an old flame after arranging to meet her in the German capital.

And actress and singer Noa Tishby posted a picture on the internet of herself and Jagger sharing a joke in a hotel room during the Stones’ stay in Israel a fortnight ago.

A source close to the band said: ‘Mick’s way of dealing with L’Wren’s death was to get back on stage as soon as possible. It wasn’t long though before he was up to his old tricks.

‘The girl in Zurich was just a brief fling but she isn’t the first and won’t be the last. Mick is like an old dog who can’t be taught new tricks. Even before he started singing he was a womaniser and he still is. He knows no other way.

‘I’m not sure what the girl in Zurich thinks, but she is a goner.’

Perhaps all the traveling to be with Mick has affected Melanie’s performances on stage. A review last week of American Ballet Theatre’s production of Cinderella, singled her out for having ‘lamentably weak’ feet in her role as the Winter Fairy.
