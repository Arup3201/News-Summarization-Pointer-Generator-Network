The American Indian child at the center of a custody suit that went to the U.S. Supreme Court should be returned to the Charleston-area couple seeking to adopt her, South Carolina's highest court ruled yesterday

In a 3-2 decision, the state Supreme Court ruled that Matt and Melanie Capobianco are the only party properly seeking to adopt three-year-old Veronica in South Carolina and ordered a Family Court to finalize the couple's adoption.

Veronica's biological father, Dusten Brown, who was not present during the birth or first two years of her life, has been denied custody.

'We are thrilled that after 18 long months, our daughter finally will be coming home,' the couple said in a statement Wednesday.

'We look forward to seeing Veronica's
smiling face in the coming days and will do everything in our power to 
make her homecoming as smooth as possible.

'We also want to thank everyone who has supported us throughout this ordeal. Our prayers have been answered.'

South
Carolina courts originally said the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act — a 
federal law intended to keep Indian children from being taken from their
homes and typically placed with non-Indian adoptive or foster parents —
favored her living with her biological father, Dusten Brown.

A
member of the Cherokee Nation, Brown had never met his daughter and, 
after the girl's non-Indian mother rebuffed his marriage proposal, 
played no role during the pregnancy and paid no child support after the 
girl was born.

But 
when Brown found out Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and 
said the law favored the girl living with him and growing up learning 
tribal traditions.

Brown took custody in 2011 and has been living with his daughter in Oklahoma since then.

But
the Capobiancos — who were present at the girl's birth and even cut her
umbilical cord raised Veronica for the first 27 months of her life — 
appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.

Last
month, the nation's high court ruled that South Carolina courts should 
decide who gets to adopt the girl, a determination the state court made 
yesterday.

'We think the 
Supreme Court plainly contemplated an expeditious resolution of this 
case, and we believe the facts of this case require it,' the South 
Carolina high court wrote, ordering a Family Court to finalize the 
Capobiancos' adoption and to terminate Brown's parental rights.

'There is absolutely no need to compound any suffering that Baby Girl may experience through continued litigation.'

Earlier this month, Brown filed a petition to adopt the child in Oklahoma.

'As
you can imagine, we are shocked and saddened at this development,' John
S. Nichols, a South Carolina-based attorney for Brown, wrote in an 
email.

'There is no 
mention, or apparent consideration, in the majority decision of the 
child's best interest, as the dissenters point out.'

Separately,
Justices Costa Pleicones and Don Beatty wrote that, while the case's 
details should be hammered out in Family Court, the transfer of the girl
should be handled delicately so as to be least disruptive to her.

'The
majority orders the immediate transfer of the child, no longer an 
infant or toddler, upon the filing of the family court's adoption order,
without regard to whether such an abrupt transfer would be in the 
child's best interest,' the two justices wrote.

'This
is a situation where the decisions that are in the best interests of 
this child, given all that has happened in her short life, must be 
sorted out in the lower court(s).'

Any parties that want the court to rehear the case have five days to make that request.
