A fraudster couple who used £1.1million stolen from a hospital to fund their decadent lifestyle were jailed yesterday.

Anne and Andrew Baker spent the money on landscaping their garden and installing cascading waterfalls and fountains at their Grade II-listed ‘dream home’.

The couple also bought a luxury villa in Turkey with the cash Anne Baker stole from her job at the  Princess Grace Hospital in Marylebone, West London.

Andrew Baker and Anne Baker, pictured outside Southwark Crown Court, were jailed for 10 years between them for a 13-year scam which saw them gain £1.1million in hospital funds

Splashing out: The couple spent a large chunk of the money in the grounds of their 2.5 acre Cornwall home, Manderley

Grand: Mr and Mrs Baker spent money of fountains and waterfalls for the gardens of their home, which is a popular wedding venue

Thousands of pounds were hidden in 
Turkish bank accounts and £25,000 was stashed in a gun cupboard at their
16th-century home, where the Bakers also kept two Jaguar sports cars 
and an Aston Martin.

Baker, 61, stole the money in a 
‘breathtaking’ 13-year fraud which saw her pocket four times her salary 
as a manager at the hospital’s radiology department. She invented a 
fictional ‘Dr Baker’ and submitted 131 bogus invoices to her department 
for radiology consultancy services. She then signed off the invoices 
herself, using her maiden name Anne Fitzpatrick, and pocketed 
£1.14million.

Baker worked at the hospital for 29 
years and ran the ‘well-oiled’ fraud from 1999 to 2012 without 
detection, Southwark Crown Court in Central London heard.

Her deception was uncovered only when an internal audit in 2012 discovered there was no ‘Dr Baker’ at the private hospital.

Mr Baker, left, was convicted of two counts of money laundering, while Mrs Baker, right, admitted false accounting and money laundering prior to her husband's case

Her 65-year-old husband knew about the scam and was a key beneficiary from his wife’s stolen cash, the court was told.

The couple spent the money on  lavish 
home improvements at their historic house and 2.5-acre gardens near 
Launceston in Cornwall.

Denial: Mr Baker, pictured, had denied that he knew anything of his wife's fraud

They marketed the house, known as 
Manderley, as a wedding venue and boasted that it had a 30ft koi carp 
lake, an exotic bird aviary, its own pitch-and-putt golf course and a 
series of dramatic waterfalls built from Dartmoor stone.

The Bakers spent £88,882 on building 
work on the sprawling detached home and invested £94,000 on a luxury 
villa in Bodrum, Turkey, before hiding £85,000 in two Turkish bank 
accounts.

Prosecutor Hugh Forgan told the court 
that Anne Baker’s fraudulent income ‘dwarfed’ the couple’s genuine 
earnings, and that her husband was aware of her scam.

‘Mr Baker turned the house in Cornwall
into something rather splendid,’ he said. ‘The defendant knew he could 
afford it because he knew full well what his wife was up to.’

Belfast-born Anne Baker admitted false
accounting and money laundering and confessed she had taken up to 
£179,000 from the hospital every year.

She has since been declared 
bankrupt and the private healthcare firm which ran the hospital has 
begun legal proceedings to retrieve the stolen money.

Her lawyer Justin Rivett said: 
‘Initially she hadn’t set out to defraud her employers over a long 
period of time, but events just simply carried on. She spent a lot of 
money and most of it did go on Manderley. It was a large property and 
expensive to maintain.’

Baker said her husband did not know about the deception and he denied money laundering.

He told the court he believed the 
money had come from the sale of a flat in London, and a £132,000 ‘bonus’
given to his wife when she retired. But the jury rejected his account 
and the judge said his explanation was ‘patently untrue’.

Anne Baker was jailed for four years 
and her husband, a qualified civil engineer, was jailed for six years. 
His longer jail term reflected his decision to plead not guilty, meaning
his case came to trial.
