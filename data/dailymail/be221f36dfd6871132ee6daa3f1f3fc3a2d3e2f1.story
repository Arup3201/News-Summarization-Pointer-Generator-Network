Hiawatha Rutland, 33, drowned after jumping from a boat into Lake Erie, Cleveland, on Sunday evening

A former Iowa state football player drowned after jumping off a boat to swim ashore with his girlfriend.

Hiawatha Rutland, 33, was found dead in Lake Erie near Whiskey Island, Cleveland, on Monday afternoon.

He tried to swim to shore from a private boat at around 7.30pm on Sunday, but began to flounder 90 feet from land and called out for help, according to authorities.

A female friend tried to jump in and save Rutland, but nearly drowned before being pulled to safety.

The Coast Guard used helicopters and boats to search for Mr Rutland, who worked as a school teacher in New York, before recovering his body.

The running back played at Iowa State from 2000 to 2003 and scored nine touchdowns before a knee injury cut his career short.

He is the eighth known Cyclone to have his life cut short during the coach Dan McCarney era.

Mr McCarney served as head coach at Iowa State University from 1995 to 2006 and during that he time led the Cyclones to five bowl games.

He said: 'Prayers go out to the family and friends of Hiawatha Rutland. People die only when we forget them, if you can remember, he will always be with us.'

Cyclones coach Paul Rhoads said: 'Great Cyclone. Great human being with a monster size heart.

'I was fortunate to be here when he was recruited, fortunate to be here when he played, fortunate to be here when he's come back to this state and this university every year. 

'A funny human being. Kind of guy that would do everything for his teammates. A great friend. Sad day.'

In 2003, former running back Ennis Haywood died after ingesting ethanol and two drugs and three years later former quarterback Cris Love lost his bout with cancer.

Fans mourned the deaths of former running back Stevie Hicks and linebacker Justin Eilers in 2008.

Earlier this year, former defensive end Jason Berryman was found shot and killed.

And Cyclones assistant Curtis Bray died of a pulmonary embolism in January.

With Haywood, Hicks, and now Rutland's deaths, Iowa State's leading rushers from the 2000 to 2006 team have all passed away.

He is the eighth known Cyclone to have his life cut short in recent years. All of Iowa State's leading rushers from the 2000 to 2006 team have now passed away
