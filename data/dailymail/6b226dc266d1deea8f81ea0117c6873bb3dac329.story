A shocked animal lover who found the partially-eaten carcass of a deer nicknamed 'Bambi' on his lawn is convinced it was attacked by a panther.

John Griffin, who found the deer's body in his country garden, was shocked when he found the small deer's body lying on the grass in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

The small deer was given free reign to eat windfall apples under his trees and became such a regular that neighbours nicknamed it Bambi.

This small deer, known as Bambi, often visited John Griffin's garden in Billingshurst, West Sussex where it had free reign of the windfall apples

But he found the carcass of the small animal on his lawn - and is convinced it was attacked by a panther 

Now Mr Griffin is convinced the animal was attacked by some sort of giant cat - because he says no other native predator could do such a 'thorough job' of pulling the carcass apart.

Mr Griffin said: 'The remains had been stripped of all flesh, and I don't know of any native predator that could do such a thorough job.

'The carcass was completely bare. I don't know what could've stripped it so quickly.'

Neighbours in the rural village say there have been several big cat sightings in recent weeks, which Mr Griffin thinks could be behind the incident.

He said: 'My son's friend said he'd seen two animals run across the road in front of him that looked like wild cats, almost panther size.'

Mr Griffin said he did not know of any native predator that 'could do such a thorough job' of stripping the carcass

Huge cat sightings have become common throughout Sussex over the last 20 years, according to one of Britain's big cat experts.

Derek Bilston, of Sussex Big Cat Watch, said: 'We know from countless sightings over the years that the most likely candidates are puma, mountain lions, leopards or a black panther.

'These are the two most seen or described animals.

'That is not to say that the animals are puma or leopard only that these are the descriptions that best fit the picture that witnesses are trying to describe.'
