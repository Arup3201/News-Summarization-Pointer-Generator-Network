Disgraced Rolf Harris, 84 (pictured with his CBE), has seen his honour annulled at the order of the Queen following his conviction for historic sex abuse

Rolf Harris has finally been stripped of the CBE that was awarded to him by the Queen.

The move came eight months after the disgraced former children’s entertainer was jailed for nearly six years for a string of attacks on girls as young as seven.

The paedophile, 84, had his honour annulled at the order of the Queen, days after being stripped of his Australian honours.

Officials at the Cabinet Office had been accused of dragging their feet over the issue, but sources insisted they had to follow established procedures before removing the gong.

An announcement in the London Gazette yesterday stated: ‘The Queen has directed that the appointment of Rolf Harris to be a Commander of the Civil Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, dated 17 June 2006, shall be cancelled and annulled and that his name shall be erased from the Register of the said Order.’

Rochdale MP Simon Danczuk, who in January raised concerns in the Daily Mail about why Harris still had a CBE, welcomed the news. 

He said: ‘I am delighted to hear that Rolf Harris has been stripped of his CBE. It is simply unacceptable convicted sex offenders like Rolf Harris should be allowed to make a mockery of our honours system.’ 

When Harris, who was jailed in July last year for 12 indecent assaults against four girls between 1968 and 1986, was stripped of his Australian honours last week, there was widespread disbelief that he still held his coveted CBE in Britain.

It was awarded to him for services to entertainment and the arts, a year after he painted the Queen’s 80th birthday portrait.

Normal protocol sees honours forfeited where the person is considered to have brought the system into disrepute.

A recommendation can be made by the Honours and Appointments Secretariat to the forfeiture committee to revoke an honour if a person has been found guilty of a criminal offence, and the final decision must be approved by the Queen.

Harris was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later, and a CBE in 2006.

During sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: 'Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself.'

Seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, including one incident when she was 15-years-old when he sexually assaulted her while Bindi slept in the adjacent bed.

During his trial, Harris was revealed as a 'Jekyll and Hyde' character who had a dark side to his personality and used his fame to 'mesmerise' underage fans before abusing them with impunity.

Scotland Yard said he 'committed many offences in plain sight of people as he thought his celebrity status placed him above the law.'

The entertainer's conviction caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain, where his television programs were watched by millions of children.

All public traces of the entertainer have since been removed from his home town of Bassendean in Western Australia following his convictions, while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished.

His artworks have also been removed from the council chambers, and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, was among those who campaigned for the removal of the CBE.

He has previously said: 'I find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long.

'A number of paedophiles, of which Rolf Harris is one, have held significant honours, including Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith. They used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children.'

Last week, Mr Danczuk wrote to Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude asking him for an update on plans to strip Harris of his CBE.

He added: 'They have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute, and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly.

'The Australians acted more quickly against Rolf Harris than we did.'

Harris, whose fortune is estimated at £11 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser.

The former children's entertainer joins the likes of dictators Robert Mugabe and Nicolae Ceausescu and disgraced ex- banker Fred 'the Shred' Goodwin in being stripped of their titles.

In January 2012, Mr Gooodwin had his knighthood revoked after he was accused of contributing to the financial crash through his mismanagement of the Royal Bank of Scotland.

Honours are usually only removed from people convicted and jailed, but the Cabinet Office said the scale of the RBS disaster - which had to be bailed out to the tune of £45billion by the taxpayer - made the case 'exceptional'.

In 2008, Mr Mugabe was stripped of his honorary knighthood over his 'abuse of human rights' and 'abject disregard' for democracy, the Foreign Office said.

The Queen approved the annulment of Mr Mugabe's knighthood, which was awarded in 1994, on the recommendation of former Foreign Secretary David Miliband.

Mr Mugabe was the first foreigner to be stripped of an honorary knighthood since Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu in 1989, the day before his execution by firing squad.

In 1979, art historian Anthony Blunt, who was personal adviser to the Queen on art, lost his knighthood after being exposed as a Soviet spy.

And in 2007, boxer 'Prince' Naseem Hamed was stripped of his MBE after serving a sentence for dangerous driving.

Other recent cases involved a doctor who was struck off following the Bristol Royal Infirmary baby death scandal, a CBE holder who was disqualified from being a company director, and a man who forged the papers that secured him an MBE for 'services to the community'.

The forfeiture of a knighthood is a rare event, and in past centuries it could involve a public ceremony of degradation during which the accoutrements of the honour would be stripped from the culprit.

This would happen when a knight was found guilty of treachery or treason.

In 1468, Sir Ralph Grey was taken to Doncaster where, being found guilty of treason, his 'gold spurs were hewn from his heels while his sword and all his armour were broken'.

What is believed to be the last public degradation was in 1621 at Westminster Hall, when Sir Francis Mitchell was found guilty of 'grievous exactions' and had his spurs broken and thrown away, his belt cut and his sword broken over his head.

Finally, he was pronounced to be 'no longer a Knight but Knave'.

More recently, Sir Roger Casement had his knighthood cancelled during the First World War for treason. He was executed after trying to enlist Germany's help in the Irish independence movement.
