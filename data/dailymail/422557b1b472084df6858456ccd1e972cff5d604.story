A head coach and assistant high school soccer coach have resigned after it was discovered one of their players insulted a West African player on an opposing team with jokes about his race and Ebola.

At least two fans wrote in complaining about hearing people at the Thursday night game in Pennsylvania taunting the player and saying they 'hoped [he] contracted Ebola.'

Both Northampton's head soccer Craig Carvin and assistant coach Jason Melniszyn left their positions soon after.

The Morning Call reports that Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said an investigation into the incident was completed Tuesday.

Neither of the coaches who resigned is a district teacher. The coaches did not respond to interview requests. 

'The administration has conducted a thorough investigation throughout the entire day and appropriate discipline will be dispensed to any students who violated the code of conduct,' he said.

He declined to say exactly what discipline might be implemented, the investigation's findings, or how many students could be disciplined, citing student confidentiality.

The teen who was insulted is from Guinea and came to the U.S. three years ago.

He was so angered by the insults he charged one of the players taunting him, and was thrown out of the game for his reaction.

The teen's custodian Edward Bachert told reporters the boy 'cried at the kitchen table when he got home.'

Northampton Area School District Superintendent Joseph Kovalchik said an investigation into the incident was completed Tuesday but would not reveal the findings or what disciplinary action might be taken

He remained so upset he even sat out the league playoff game this weekend.

His teammates at least have been supportive, wearing wristbands with the slogan #ENDRACISM.

Sadly, many callous people have found the Ebola outbreak is a reason for sick humor.

People living in a gated community in Scottsdale, Arizona, woke up Tuesday morning to discover the ominous words 'Ebola Quarantine Zone' spray-painted on one of the outside entrance walls. 

Those living in the neighbhrood were not amused to see the writing suggesting that their quiet community has been touched by the deadly virus, which claimed its first victim on US soil as recently as last week.

And earlier this week, the typically progressive Village Voice was lambasted on Twitter when an article on a Nigerian Independence Day parade in New York was subtitled: 'Cloudy With a Chance of Ebola.'
