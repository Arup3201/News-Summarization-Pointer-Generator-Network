Floyd Mayweather was half a pound heavier than Marcos Maidana as they weighed in on the eve of their megabucks fight in Las Vegas.

The greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world was also half a pound inside the 147-pound limit for his multiple defences of the welterweight and light middleweight titles.

Mayweather has been predicting that his Argentine challenger would bulk up before they enter the ring at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.

Marcos Maidana has trimmed down in the hope of matching Floyd Mayweather's dynamic speed on Saturday

However, Maidana appears to have trimmed down in the hope of matching Mayweather's speed.

Maidana even dictated that he is going to vary the all-out slugging style which gave Mayweather a hard time here four months ago.

Maidana, who was booed by the majority of the 7,000-strong crowd, said: 'If we want to see things different again, then I'll change the result.'

Mayweather refused suggestions that Maidana is the most physical opponent of his career but says he 'is a very solid, competitive challenge'.

'I'm the one who can make the adjustments and I will take my time this time,' added Mayweather.

Maidana was booed as he entered the stage and does not appear to have as many supporters in town for this rematch.
