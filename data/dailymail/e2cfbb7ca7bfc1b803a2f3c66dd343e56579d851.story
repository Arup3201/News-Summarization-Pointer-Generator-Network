You have heard of the Easter Bunny but these rare white lion cubs are giving an African twist on the spring bank holiday.

Just four days old, the sleepy eyed cubs are seen rolling around these colourful Easter eggs with handler, Kirsty Trusler, at the Lion Park in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Ms Trusler, 24, from Lancaster, is responsible for caring for the rare white lion cubs who are two of just 50 in their native country of South Africa.

The two rare cubs were bred at Johannesburg's Lion Park which specialises in white lions

White Lions are not albinos, but a 
genetic rarity unique to the Timbavati region. Like blue eyes in humans,
the animals' white colour is caused by a recessive gene shared by both 
parents.

The earliest recorded sighting of 
white lions in the Timbavati region was in 1938. However, the oral 
records of African elders indicate that these unique animals survived in
this region for many centuries.

Since their discovery white lions have been hunted, and forcibly removed from their natural endemic habitat.

The white lion species is endangered because their light coats make it harder for them to camouflage

The last white lion was seen in the wild in 1994, after which time they were technically extinct in the wild.

The survival of white lions has been 
attributed by some to their very whiteness meaning they lack the 
camouflage of the tawny lions.

The Johannesburg Lion Park has specialised in 
breeding programmes designed to discourage the inter-breeding of the 
white lion and have agreements with other white lion breeders to ensure 
genetic integrity.

White lions are native to only the 
Greater Timbavati region of South Africa, an area characterised by white
sandy riverbeds and long grass scorched pale by the sun.

They
are regarded as sacred animals by the people of that region, but after 
Europeans 'discovered' them in the 1970s, many were taken from the wild 
to captive breeding and hunting operations.

These
removals, along with lion culling and trophy hunting of male lions, 
depleted the gene pool and the animals have been technically extinct in 
the wild for the past 19 years.

In
their natural habitat, white lions are regarded as 'apex predators', 
able to hunt successfully in day and night and take down prey as large 
as giraffes.

Despite their rarity, white lions are 
not yet classified as endangered because biologists still regard them as
ultimately the same as their tawny equivalents.

The
Global White Lion Protection Trust is campaigning for white lions to be
recognised as a subspecies of lions, so that they can be protected 
under international law.

However,
the genetic marker that makes white lions unique has not yet been 
identified by scientists and research into the animals is ongoing.

The
trust estimates that there are no more than 300 white lions in 
existence. In recent years it has reintroduced the animals to a nature 
reserve within Greater Timbavati in an effort to eventually reintroduce 
the gene to wild lions.
