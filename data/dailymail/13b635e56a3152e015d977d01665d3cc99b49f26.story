Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers has leapt to the defence of Simon Mignolet after the Reds goalkeeper continues to come under heavy criticism for his displays this season.

Mignolet was under the microscope of scrutiny once more as the Anfield outfit battled back from a goal down to win 3-1 at Leicester in their Premier League encounter on Tuesday.

The 26-year-old nearly gifted the hosts an early lead when his sloppy back-pass found Esteban Cambiasso, but the midfielder could only shoot wide with the goal at his mercy.

Minutes later the Belgian international did concede at the King Power Stadium, in one of the unluckiest of ways, as Foxes' striker Leonardo Ulloa's shot rebounded off the the post before hitting Mignolet on the head as he scored an own goal.

Despite his indifferent display on Tuesday, Rodgers believes his first-choice stopper is improving on a daily basis at the club.

'Simon Mignolet is working very hard on the training field to improve,' he told reporters ahead of their home clash with Sunderland on Saturday.

The midweek win saw the Merseysiders complete successive league victories for only the second-time this season and Rodgers believes thier upturn in form is a testament to the character within his squad.

'It's a really exciting period,' he added. 'The players have shown the character I always said they had. They have responded magnificently.'
