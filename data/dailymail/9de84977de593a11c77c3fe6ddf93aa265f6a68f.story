Israeli scientist Yaron Svoray has been given permission and assistance from Germany to search for the gold

The German government is backing a bid by an Israeli researcher to find a billion pound fortune in looted Nazi gold in a lake near Berlin.

Legend has it that 18 crates of gold and platinum were dumped by an S.S. squad in the Stolpsee lake in Brandenburg in the closing days of the Second World War and lie in less than 50 feet of water. 

They were allegedly dumped in a secret operation codenamed ‘Operation Nibelung’ after the vast treasure of the mythical Burgundians whose stories are told in Wagner’s opera cycle The Ring of the Nibelungen.

The lake lies in what was former East Germany and was the scene of frantic dives organised by the Stasi secret police desperate for treasure to sell in order to buy much needed foreign currency. 

The treasure has a conservative value of around a billion pounds.

But if it is there, it lies under at least six feet of lake-bottom sludge and the Israeli team which arrived on its shores this week have brought along sophisticated sonar gear in a bid to locate it.

The treasure belonged to Hermann Goering - Luftwaffe chief, one-time deputy to Hitler and the greatest thief of the Third Reich - who stored it at his hunting lodge Carinhall 50 miles north of Berlin.

Carinhall was bedecked with some of the most beautiful treasures of Europe, stolen to order by Goering, but emptied in early 1945 as the Red Army moved closer to Berlin and blown up on his orders.

To this day it is a magnet for treasure hunters who pour into the woods and ruins in unsuccessful attempts to find what they believe is missing loot still hidden in secret bunkers.

Witnesses said they saw Polish slave labourers being forced to dump up to £1billion of gold in the lake

Eighteen months ago a consortium of British businessmen expressed an interest to the German government of diving for it but nothing came of their expedition. 

According to eyewitness accounts from the time, Polish slave labourers assisted the S.S. in dumping the gold into the lake and were then executed, their bodies weighted and then thrown into the water after the treasure.

The search has been reignited after claims by a local priest, Erich Koehler, 79, who has researched the legend of the treasure and who was a pastor near the lake during the East German communist regime.

'They didn’t have the technology in the former East Germany to properly examine the lake,' he said.

'But there are enough local people still around to know that the gold is there – and the bodies of the poor souls forced to dump it into the water.’

Erich Mielke, the chief of the Stasi, believed in the story and won politburo approval for his search back in 1986. 

The hunt was codenamed Operation Autumn Wind and grainy black and white photos exist of the search in the murky depths.

The Israeli team has been bolstered in its confidence of finding treasure from papers found in the German Federal Archive in Koblenz.

SS documents together with post-war eye witness statements to the events on the lake in March 1945, give credence to the theory that precious material was indeed dumped into the 400-feet deep lake.

One witness, Eckhard Litz, told a 
post-war allied commission: ‘I remember well the night that lorries with
 slit headlights drove up to the lakeshore and I saw about 20 to 30 
skeletal figures dressed in striped concentration camp uniforms being 
forced to unload heavy boxes.

‘These were put into two rowing boats which made six separate trips to the centre of the lake.

‘When the last case had been thrown overboard, the men returned to shore, were lined up and the last thing I saw were the flashes of the machine guns of the guards as they were killed.’

He said the bodies were then loaded back onto the rowing boats which were then taken out by the SS to the centre of the lake and sunk. A third boat brought back the SS men to the shore.

Goering is alleged to have personally taken charge of numerous amounts of bullion from the national bank of Poland following the Nazi invasion in 1939.  It is this loot which allegedly lies in the Stolpsee.

Israeli scientists Yaron Svoray, 59, received permission and assistance from Germany for the searches which begin this week. 

He said: 'It is not just about the treasure but also about the people who it once belonged to.  It is about putting things right.'

His sonar equipment alone costs 50,000 pounds.

Dr. Thomas Kersting, of the Brandenburg state office for monuments, said: 'This is an expedition of extreme historical interest.'
