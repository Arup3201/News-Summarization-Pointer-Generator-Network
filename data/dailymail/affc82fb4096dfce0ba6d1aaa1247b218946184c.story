A group of scouts thought their tired old hut was going to be completely transformed when it was accepted onto a popular TV makeover show.

But the leaders of the 24th Abingdon Scouts in Oxfordshire claim the building was left an 'unusable shambles' with a leaky roof after a team from Channel Five's Operation Homefront had finished work on it.

As soon as the cameras were switched off after filming of the show - presented by Suzi Perry - problems started to develop.

Members of the Scout troop have been forced to hold meetings outdoors and their leaders have appealed for help to finish off a list of 100 jobs.

The hut has been left with a leaking roof, incomplete electrics and plumbing and dangerous fire exits.

The show sees groups of ex-servicemen transform projects struggling with manpower.

Problems: The hut was left with a leaking roof and a list of other problems following filming of the show

A team from the programme carried out 
the work over four days at the beginning of August with the programme 
set to air next month.

However, it seems the team may have 
taken on more than it bargained for when it offered to demolish the old 
1940s building, then move and renovate the Scouts’ ‘Terrapin’ huts 
nearby.

Perry, who has hosted The Gadget Show and the BBC’s MotoGP coverage, tweeted during the renovation: 'The Scout hut rebuild is chugging along but we definitely took on a bit too much.'

Unhappy: Mr Grimes crouches next to a puddle of water which has seeped in from the hut's leaking roof

The Scout group, which has about 25 
members, returned from its summer break but was unable to use the 
building and instead met at the nearby nature reserve.

Scout leader David Grimes said the hut was unusable.

'Fair enough, they have achieved more in four days than we could in weeks but we can’t use it as it is,' he said.

'It is a shambles.'

A spokesman for NorthOne TV, which produces the show, said: 'We brought in what amounted to tens of thousands of pounds worth of materials and manpower, as well as the complex project management behind it.

'There is always going to be what’s called a ‘finishing list’ of jobs which need to be completed when you undertake something of this scale - but the substance of what was achieved was phenomenal.

'One of the Scout leaders went as far as saying the original hut was lucky not to have been condemned - and the whole place amounted to ‘a prayer that needed answering’.'

The spokesman added: 'We are in constant contact with the Scout group secretary and will continue to help them on a few jobs which need finishing.

'We agreed what we would do to the Scout hut and we feel we have delivered on it.'

Opinions also appear to be divided within the Scout group over the work carried out by Operation Homefront.

The troop's secretary Julie Mansbridge said she and others were 'hugely grateful for Operation Homefronts renovation.'

'They achieved in four days what would have taken us four years in terms of workload and tens of thousands in financial assistance,' she said.
