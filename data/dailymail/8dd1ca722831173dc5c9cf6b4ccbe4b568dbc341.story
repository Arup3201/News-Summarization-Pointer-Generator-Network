Eight puppies have been rescued after they were stuffed into a bin in blistering heat and left to die.

The cross-breed dogs' callous owner even dragged the bin into the middle of a country lane near Orpington, Kent, putting the dogs in danger of being hit by a car.

A concerned motorist pulled over on Friday and found the pets distressed and suffering from dehydration.

'Roasted alive': A concerned motorist  found the pets distressed and suffering from dehydration

He took them to an animal shelter where they have made a remarkable recovery, and were named after sugary treats to reflect their 'sweet' nature.

Staff at Foal Farm Animal Rescue Centre now hope BonBon, Humbug, Dib Dab, Jelly Bean, Mars, Fudge, Crunchie and Bounty can find new homes.

Debra Taylor, the centre's manager, said: 'Somebody phoned up. He was quite upset and said
 he had found a bin full of puppies and didn’t know what to do.

'We told him to bring the puppies over to us. He turned up with a couple of other guys with the puppies in the back of his car.

'When the pups arrived they were overheated and panting. We took them inside and put them in a cool room and treated them.'

'I
 can’t believe someone could do something so callous. It was the hottest
 day of the year. Just when you think you’ve seen it all something like 
this happens.

'They would have roasted alive if someone hadn’t picked them up.

'We are grateful they are safe - even though we’re full to capacity like most animal rescue centres.

'It could have been a lot worse.'

The dogs were found at the end of a week which saw parts of the country bask in temperatures of 32C.

Sarah Mitchell, kennel supervisor, said abandoned dogs were brought in every week - but this case was particularly callous.

'The bin had been moved to the middle of the road so any passing car would have to stop,' she said.

'We've done some initial investigations but there's no microchips on the puppies so there's not much we can do to track down the owner.

'We had two puppies just the day before. It's more irresponsible breeding than anything else. We've had cases of cruelty where dogs have had mange, losing all their hair.

'When we think about how these puppies were discarded, in heat, in a bin and left to die our hearts sink at the total lack of compassion, kindness and care for animal welfare.

'All people need to do is take these unwanted animals to a rescue where they will be kept safe, secure and be loved by the staff and volunteers and given a chance of life.'
