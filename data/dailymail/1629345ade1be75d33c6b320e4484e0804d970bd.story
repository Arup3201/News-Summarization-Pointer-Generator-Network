Towering 40ft high, measuring 60ft wide and estimated to weigh up to 18,000 tons, it’s enough to take your breath away - quite literally.

So pity the residents of a neatly kept suburban cul-de-sac who have had to put up with this huge mountain of stinking rubbish at the end of the road for the past three years.

The Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm that runs the waste disposal site, claiming it has not been paying for the mound to be treated and sent on for disposal or recycling elsewhere.

Huge heap: The residents of Orpington are fighting the owners of a refuse tip at the end of their cul de sac that has grown to around 50ft engulfing their homes

Disgusting: The waste was supposed to be removed in June 2013. The price of a three-bedroom house in the road has plummeted from £250,000 to £225,000

Stinking: A site worker scavenges through new rubbish at the site. The smell means that residents cannot open their windows or enjoy their gardens

All the while the residents of Cornwall Drive in St Paul's Cray, in Bromley, south-east London, have not been able to enjoy their gardens and dare not open their windows to cool down in summer.

Not impressed: Alan Cowburn, 74, a retired printer who 
has lived there since 1971, said: ‘It’s a nightmare, all the dust, the 
huge lorries with their reversing beepers.

On top of that, they say the price of a three-bedroom house in the road has plummeted from £250,000 to £225,000.

Alan Cowburn, 74, a retired printer who has lived there since 1971, said: ‘It’s a nightmare, all the dust, the huge lorries with their reversing beepers.

‘The smell can be overpowering outside, like burnt plastic. It sometimes permeates into my house. I’ve been violently sick on occasions.

‘I’m sure we get more flies round here than we used to, and I’ve seen a few rats. I’d do anything to get rid of it.’

Nasrin 
Sultana, 33, an NHS administrative worker, and her husband Anisur Rahman, 35, who
 runs an off-licence, fear for their daughter Rowzarida, three, and son 
Reean, eight.

Nasrin
 said: ‘It’s really horrible, and we’re really scared when there are 
fires. You can’t even sit in the garden because of the smell and we keep
 the windows shut because of the dust.

‘About every eight weeks the children feel sick for a couple of weeks. They weren’t like that before we moved here.’

The Environment Agency said it served notice on Waste4Fuel to remove all waste from the site by June 2013.

According to the firm’s website, they 
‘specialise in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be 
reprocessed for use in generating electricity’.

When the firm failed to act, the agency took the case to the High Court and obtained an order to make it comply by May 1 this year, but it still failed to do so.

Now the case is back in court. It was adjourned yesterday to continue next week.

Eyesore: According to the firm’s website, they 'specialise in the collection and correct disposal of waste that can be 
reprocessed for use in generating electricity'

Vast: The scale of the mountain of waste was captured in this aerial shot earlier this year

Giant: The pile of dirt dwarfs the sizeable suburban houses, blocking their view of the idyllic lake

Rancid: Site workers are dwarfed by the looming pile. The Environment Agency is currently locked in a legal battle with the firm that runs the waste disposal site

Unsanitary: A fire burning at the Waste4Fuel site. The neat cul-de-sac has had more flies than it did before the rubbish pile - some residents even reported seeing rats
