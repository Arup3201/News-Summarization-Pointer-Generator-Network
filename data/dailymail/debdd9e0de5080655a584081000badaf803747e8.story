A bragging burglary gang who boasted about their crimes by writing raps to each other following their raids has been jailed.

The five man group recorded the congratulatory rhymes on their mobile phones, sending them to one another.

The raps, largely made up of street slang, reference the sound of a 'patio breaking' and the burglars' craving for 'keys N watches'.

Jailed: A rap detailing the burglaries was found on the mobile phone of David Levesconte, left, when police arrested him. Levesconte and Drew McWilliam, right, admitted conspiracy to commit burglary. Both have been jailed for 40 months 

Despite the lyrics suggesting that a 'break in takes balls', the group's recordings eventually lead to their arrest.

Police discovered a verse on a mobile phone, saying: 'That me n Levo on a break in.'

Officers soon realised that 'Levo' was in fact David Levesconte, 22, one of the gang members.

'Cause I’m cold like snow when I’m flaking,

What’s that the sound of UR patio breaking,

That me n Levo on a break in

Your car keys N watches were cravin

Cartiers N S3S were taking

But facing a break in takes balls it’s a bait ting Haa.'

The gang's haul included 24 luxury cars, computers, TVs laptops, games-consoles, watches and jewellery worth £400,000.

The criminals were responsible for 65 burglaries across Manchester, Wilmslow and Handforth, Cheshire.

Levesconte admitted conspiracy to commit burglary between 1 August 2011 and 30 December 201 at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester.

Drew McWilliam, 20, and Ryan Condron, 21, also admitted conspiracy to commit burglary at dwellings between the same time period.

Each of the gang members was jailed for 40 months.

Another trio, Shaquile Brown, 19, Jonathon Snape, 25, Jaymi Walker, 21, admitted handling stolen goods.

Brown and Snape were jailed for two years, while Walker was given a 12 month community order.

Kate Ridgard, 32, of Chorlton, Manchester admitted handling stolen goods and was ordered to undertake 140 hours unpaid work.

The gang operated by forcing entry into the houses or entering through insecure doors or windows.

The burglaries were committed late at 
night and once inside the burglars would search the homes for car keys 
and other items before leaving in the stolen vehicles.

Among the haul of stolen cars, were 
two Nissan Qashqais, a Mercedes 240, two Audi A4s, an Audi A6, a 
Landrover Discovery, a Mini Cooper and a Peugeot 207 and a Toyota Prius.

Some of the cars have still not been recovered.

One victim confronted two of the gang members during a burglary. But when he shouted 'What are you doing?', the criminals simply responded 'What does it look like?'

The pair then broke a window in the house's front door and took the man's car keys before escaping in his Audi.

Following Levescontes’ arrest, the ‘rhyme’ was found on his phone.

He initially refused to admit responsibility when he was interviewed by officers - and said the rap had been written by someone else.

Detective Constable Matt Whittaker, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'We spent months unravelling the activities of this organised crime group, who were involved in a plot to break into people’s homes in order to steal cars.

'The fact that more than 60 crimes have been detected gives you an indication of how determined and persistent they were and their actions along with the ‘rhyme’ found on Levescontes’ phone - which gives a clear insight into their activities - proves they have no regard for local residents or their belongings.'

Chief Inspector Koran Sellars, said: 'I must commend the efforts of all the officers involved, who have worked tirelessly for months to bring the offenders to justice.

'Had it not been for their thorough and meticulous investigation these men and women would undoubtedly be out there today committing more crime.'
