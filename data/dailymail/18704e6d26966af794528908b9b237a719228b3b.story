A tree frog gives his friend a leg up onto a twig in an extraordinary display of amphibian teamwork that really is quite ribbetting to watch.

The magnificently-coloured frogs were trying to clamber up a tree deep in the heart of the Costa Rican rainforest when one got a little stuck.

But instead of leaving his stricken mate behind, the more agile specimen stuck out his hind leg to help her onto the perch.

After dangling precariously for a few seconds, she worked her way up his body onto the twig to carry on their journey high into the trees.

Ribbetting: The moment was captured in the Adrena Volcano National Park in Costa Rica, as two distinctive red-eyed tree frogs clambered up a tree

Teamwork: The red-eyed tree frog has three eyelids and sticky pads on its toes and is native to Neotropical rainforests in Central America

The shot was captured in the Adrena Volcano National Park in Costa Rica. by photographer Nicolas Reu.

Nicholas, 37, has 
taken pictures of wildlife from all around the world but was thrilled 
when he managed to snap this shot.

He said: 'I was hoping to capture a moment I witnessed in nature once, and this was the result after a lot of waiting. It seemed to me as if one frog was begging the other for help, while trying to stay alive.'

'They are incredibly agile creatures and it was great to photograph them in their natural habitat- almost camouflaged within the trees.'

The red-eyed tree frog has three eyelids and sticky pads on its toes that usually make climbing trees second nature.
