Joe Hart insists he will be ready to deal with Luis Suarez and the rest of his Uruguay team-mates on Thursday.

England take on Uruguay later this week in what Hart believes is a 'do-or-die' match because of Saturday's 2-1 defeat to Italy.

Suarez is back in full training following a knee injury and is expected to start the match at the Itaquerao Stadium.

Prepared: Joe Hart says he is ready for the challenge of Uruguay on Thursday

Suarez enjoyed a prolific year with Liverpool last season, scoring 27 league goals, and Uruguay also have the considerable talents of Diego Forlan and Edinson Cavani to call upon.

Hart has been studying videos of all the Uruguay players, though, to make sure he is ready to stop whatever the opposition throws at him on Thursday.

'Dave [Watson, goalkeeping coach] studies the tapes of Uruguay and we are well aware of their strikers and their pattern of finishing,' England's number one told TheFA.com.

'We had a lot of sharp shots around the 
box (in training). We cover in general, but we specify short, sharp 
shots as they have got a lot of boys who get it out of their feet and 
bang it.'

England need to beat Uruguay and Costa Rica to guarantee their progression to the knock-out stages.

A draw and a win could be enough for England to qualify, providing other results go their way, but Hart sees Thursday's game as a must-win.

'We've got to win in Sao Paulo,' said the 27-year-old, who earned his 41st cap in Manaus.

'We did play well (against Italy) and there were a lot of positives, but the outcome was not want we wanted and it's not what we've come here for.

'We've put ourselves in a do-or-die situation, which we are prepared for. We need to win. We didn't go into the Italian game with any intention of losing - it's done now, we've moved on.'
