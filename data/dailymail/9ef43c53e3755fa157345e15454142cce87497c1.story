A daughter who was given up for adoption by her mother tracked her down through Facebook and was reunited with her on live TV in a highly emotional meeting.

Stacie Wall decided that she just couldn’t give Emily Mortier the life she deserved, so she allowed her to be adopted.

To make it easier she didn’t even hold Emily when she was born.

The decision was so difficult and heartbreaking that she required counselling afterwards.

But that wasn’t the end of the story.

Emily’s adopted mother wrote to Stacie regularly and kept her up to date with her progress.

And when Emily turned 18 she decided to track Stacie down, eventually reaching her after finding her brother on Facebook.

For seven years they regularly texted and spoke on the phone – but then finally met face-to-face for the first time in a tearful reunion on the Today show.

Stacie was so overwhelmed that she took several seconds to compose herself.

Emily said: ‘I knew it would always be an instant connection.’

The show also introduced Emily to her half brother.

Stacie told the show that she'd given Emily up because she 'could not take care of her and give her all that she needed'.

Emily explained that she wanted to find Stacie because she felt that ‘there was always a piece of the puzzle missing’.
