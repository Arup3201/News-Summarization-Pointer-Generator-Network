Galaxy S II smartphone: BT's lawsuit joins other patent lawsuits against Google's Android operating system from companies such as Microsoft, Apple and Oracle

Steve Jobs famously said that Google's Android was a 'stolen product' and that he would spend all of Apple's money, if necessary, to fight the phone operating system.

Apple and Microsoft are already suing Google for alleged patent infringement.

Now telecoms giant BT has joined the fight, alleging that Google has infringed BT's patents with technologies found in Google's Android system, as well as Google search and Google Maps.

The case focuses on six patents owned by BT.

How realistic this latest suit is remains to be seen.

BT famously sued internet service providers such as Prodigy and AOL in 2002 for patent infringement relating to hyperlinks - the links that form the structure of the entire internet.

BT wanted a licence fee from each and every internet service provider that used hyperlinks - ie all internet service providers.

The suit failed.

The telecoms giant has filed legal proceedings at the US District Court of Delaware and is seeking unspecified damages as well as an injunction against Google's continued use of Google search, Android and Google Maps.

The move follows legal action by Apple, Microsoft, Oracle and others, which have all made claims against Google's Android system.

A BT spokesman said: 'This is about protecting BT's investment in its intellectual property rights and innovation. It is a well-considered claim and we believe there is a strong case of infringement.'

BT has spent more than Â£5 billion on research and development in the last five years.

The suit revolves around six patents held by BT - a technology giant which holds 5,600 patents

A Google spokeswoman said: 'We believe these claims are groundless and we will vigorously defend ourselves against them.'

If successful, the suit could mean that Google or mobile handset makers will have to pay BT royalties on each Android handset in use and which they produce.

In documents submitted to the courts, BT claims Google offers a range of products and services that 'incorporate' technology invented by BT prior to Google's founding.

BT claims services including Google Music, Android, Google Plus, Google Maps, Google Books and eBooks all infringe BT's own patents.

BT has a total worldwide portfolio of around 5,600 patents and applications.
