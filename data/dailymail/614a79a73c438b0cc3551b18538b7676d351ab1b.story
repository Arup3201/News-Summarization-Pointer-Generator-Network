A social worker who helped elderly people by day and performed a lewd burlesque act dressed as a pensioner by night has been disciplined by her council employer.

Amy Spilsbury-Butler, 39, used the stage names Molly Marmalade and Old Molly for her act, in which she danced wearing a hairnet, slippers and oversized coat.

She was rebuked by her employers after an online video of her performing was seen by a  relative of one of her clients, who made a complaint.

Ms Spilsbury-Butler then posted ‘inappropriate’ comments on her Facebook page about the relative’s concern.

At a hearing of the Health and Care Professions Council (HCPC), the panel said that Ms Spilsbury-Butler had breached the standard of behaviour expected of a social worker.

One of the stipulations of the job is that ‘high standards of personal conduct’ must be kept.

She was ordered to remove the videos of her Molly Marmalade act from the internet, told not to portray ‘vulnerable’ people in any future act, and ordered to clear new dances with bosses before performing them.

The panel concluded that Ms Spilsbury-Butler’s competence  as a social worker at Bromley Council in Kent was ‘not in question’ and a three-year caution order was imposed.

That means her name on the industry register will now be accompanied by a note containing details of the hearing.

Notes from the panel said: ‘According to Ms Spilsbury- Butler, the outcome and recommendations at her original hearing included to refrain from portraying vulnerable people in any burlesque acts that she did in the future. She has given her employer specific details of her current  acts and confirmed that none of them portray such people.’

Despite the rebuke, Ms Spilsbury-Butler continues to perform burlesque.

She has changed her stage name to Alabama Breeze and new  internet videos show her undressing and shaking her breasts  and bottom at the audience.

The care worker regularly performs at burlesque nights with names such as Infinitease, wearing corsets and wigs.

Writing on her own website, Ms Spilsbury-Butler, from Bromley, describes her act as consisting of ‘sensual fan dances, balloon- popping routines and those cheeky  little routines that are only  performed after midnight’. She adds that she is an ‘accomplished actress and pin-up model’.

On her Facebook page, she describes her current act as ‘a  little more dark and daring’.

A Bromley Council spokesman said yesterday: ‘It would not be appropriate to comment on an individual case. The council has addressed the matter and taken appropriate action.’

Ms Spilsbury-Butler was  unavailable for comment last night, although she has previously admitted in submissions to the HCPC panel that her behaviour was ‘silly’ and ‘highly inappropriate’ and expressed her regret.
