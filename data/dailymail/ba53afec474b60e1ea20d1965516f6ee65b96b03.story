Andres Iniesta has described new Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal as 'someone very important to me' and said that the Holland boss commands complete respect.

Iniesta was a young player at Barcelona when van Gaal was at the Nou Camp, and believes that the Dutchman's attitude to youth was vital in building his career.

The Spain playmaker also acknowledged that the United boss can be imposing, and commands respect of even the most experienced player.

Asked by Barca Fans TV whether his former manager was an imposing figure he answered: 'Yes. He already commands respect when you are a veteran, so imagine when you have just entered the team and you are young.

'But the truth is I have a special memory of him, because he is someone very important to me and if there was something he cared about was supporting the young players from the reserves.'
