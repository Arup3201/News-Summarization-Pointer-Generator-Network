Controversial Jeopardy! champion Arthur Chu has revealed his favourite part of his 12-show run was not walking away with a whopping $300,000 in prize money but overhearing the show's camera men exclaiming 'this kid is too damn good.'

The 30-year-old insurance analyst bared all to Reddit users yesterday, taking part in one of the social-networking website's 'Ask Me Anything' events, where a celebrity fields questions from the site's users.

When asked to describe the atmosphere behind the scenes of the television show, which was first broadcast in America 50 years ago, Mr Chu, from Broadview Heights, Ohio, said: 'I never saw Alex [Trebeck, the presenter] at all backstage, though he was very nice to everyone during the little chats during the credits.

Arthur Chu was surprised by how much of a backlash there was against him but doesn't let it faze him

'The crew were also great to me - though I confess the best part was overhearing snatches of conversation behind my back with two camera guys going "This kid is too damn good!"'

Mr Chu finished third on Wednesday's edition of Jeopardy!, ending a winning streak that has garnered a lot of media attention for his unorthodox approach.

His strategy involved ditching 
the usual style of finishing each category's questions before moving on. Instead, he switched-up his category choices, seemingly at random, to keep his opponents guessing.

After spending weeks studying the game before his appearances, he concluded that the bottom rows of the game board are most likely 
to contain the hidden Daily Doubles - where contestants have a chance to double their winnings - and he played specifically to seek them out.

Chu's run makes him the third most successful contestant ever to appear on Jeopardy! - outside of special competitions - but he was still a way behind reigning champion Ken Jennings, who walked away with $2.5million after 74 consecutive victories in 2004.

Chu's aggressive
 strategy earned a lot of flak from fans of the show, particularly on social media, as they felt it showed a lack of respect of the game's conventions.

Chu told Reddit that while he expected some backlash, he was shocked at how vehement his critics became.

He said: 'I wasn't surprised that there was a negative reaction - in researching past contestants like Roger Craig and Dave Madden who've had a similar playstyle I saw a ton of hate for them from Internet Mean Girls.

'I was still surprised to get as much hate as quickly as I did -- I thought people might get mad at me after I'd been on the show for a while, but I kind of got freaked out at how many negative tweets there were after just my first night.'

He singled out some of the abuse as particularly spiteful.

He said: 'The most mind-blowing one was the one that literally said "I hope your wife dies". That's beyond even clever trolling to just straight-up mental problems.'

Despite all this hate, Chu told Reddit users he did not let it get to him.

'I don't really get mad on a personal 
level with haters because, well, how can I take it personally when they 
don't know me as a person?' he said.

'It's such a clich√©d lesson to say you've 
learned but having been on the "celebrity" side of the fence I kind of 
see how messed up it is, people making judgments about you based on one 
thing you said or one face you made in front of a camera.'

Chu hopes his experience of dealing with the social media controversy could help him cash in even further and he is considering writing a book on the subject.

He said: 'If I ever do write something it'll probably be more addressed at the social-media backlash and the backlash-to-the-backlash and the whole weird phenomenon of being a media "villain", which to me is the much more unique part of the story.'

While previous AMAs with high-profile figures such as Barack Obama and Bill Gates attracted nearly 30,000 comments, Mr Chu's saw 1,500 messages posted onto his thread.

However, despite the lower turnout, his jokey tone during the conversations was in stark contrast to the dour - at times even arrogant - persona he adopted while on television.

The change of tack even allowed him to win over some former critics, with one user posting: 'Arthur, the first night you were on jeopardy, I tweeted you ("Please, Arthur, do not win #jeopardy. I will not watch another episode with you on it" @amyedwardst). You tweeted back and I felt really bad/guilty. Did I hurt your feelings? I really am very sorry. Congratulations on your winnings! I miss you being on the show.'

According to Chu, his cold persona was never meant to come across as brash and thinks that letting it slip was the reason for his downfall.

He said: 'It wasn't really a conscious strategy to intimidate people. I think when I said that the game is "about intimidation" a lot of my critics took that to mean I was a dick, like I walked into the green room, folded my arms and spat "Buncha lousy maggots" at all y'all.

Champion Chu: Arthur, who took home close to $300,000 in prize money before finally being kicked off Jeopardy! on Wednesday night, told GMA he planned to spend the money wisely

'In reality the main thing was that I knew that lots of Jeopardy contestants are smart but it's their emotions that make them lose. And I was really really intent on not letting my emotions get to me -- in the end I was unsuccessful and went "on tilt" once I started having a bad day, leading to my loss, but it was being a "robot" onstage that kept me from freaking out and kept me focused enough to still pull out victories even after taking big losses.'

Chu has a number of ideas of how to best use his financial windfall. Firstly, he plans take his wife, Eliza, on holiday to China but then intends to split the rest of the $297,200 jackpot between investments and charitable donations.

When pushed on which charities he might choose, Chu gave the controversial answer of WikiLeaks, an organisation that has been in the news as much for its founder Julian Assange's alleged crimes as it has for its work supporting whistleblowers.

He said: 'I'm super troubled about the things we continue to learn about the US government's surveillance of the Internet, the way our wars are being conducted overseas without a proper sense of law or accountability, etc.

'I have a lot of differences with Wikileaks as an organization and Julian Assange in particular as a person, but it's the only organization big enough and loud enough to be making a major difference with those issues right now and I cannot believe how incredibly f***** up it was that the whole banking industry basically colluded to make it impossible to donate money to them and most people did not apparently see anything wrong with this.'

Chu, who works as a voice over artist on the side, said his only regret about his appearance on the show was allowing producers who convince him to demonstrate his voice skills on national television as he thinks, looking back, it was far from his best work.

However, overall he said he had 'a blast' and said 'it's never a bad thing to come home to your wife and tell her you just made $100,000 for one day of work.'

He said: 'So much ridiculously good stuff has happened -- not just the money but the insane 15 minutes of fame I've gotten, the Twitter fan following, the crazy experiences like being flown out to NYC on ABC's dime to be on national TV -- that I'd be an ass to say I regretted any of it.

'Like I said I even have to be grateful to the haters because I'd never have attained the status of "supervillain" if not for their outsized negative response to me.'

However, he did admit that it didn't feel that way at the time.

'Yes, in retrospect I had a blast. It was an amazing experience -- but at the time it wasn't fun, it was pure pain and sacrifice. It's the kind of "fun" that's fun in your memory because you worked your ass off at something incredibly hard and against all odds you got good at it and it paid off -- but at the time you're suffering,' he said.

Mr Chu was finally unseated by Diana Peloquin of Ann Arbor, Michigan, who led Wednesday's show with $15,700.

Chu, who described Peloquin on Reddit as a 'worthy successor', struggled for much of the show when, in Final Jeopardy, he risked, 
and lost, his entire day's bankroll - $6,400 - on the question: 'He was 
the last male monarch who had not previously been Prince of Wales.'

Only Peloquin had the correct response: George VI.
