Kristine Hewlett was flung from nine-year-old mare Cher (pictured) in November and suffered a spinal fracture but she has vowed to ride again

A horse rider has vowed to get back in the saddle despite breaking her spine twice in two years after being thrown from the same mare.

Kristine Hewlett, 25, fell off her nine-year-old Cher, when the animal bucked during a riding lesson.

She was airlifted to hospital on November 30 where it was confirmed she had suffered a L1 fracture of the spine - a similar injury she had suffered after falling off Cher in 2011.

It is the second time she has suffered serious injuries when she took Cher out for a ride.

The 16.2 hand horse, a thorough-bred cross Cleveland Bay, is looked after at the White Horse Equine Centre, near Daventry, Northants.

Kristine, who lives with her parents near the equine centre, said: 'We were doing some work without the stirrups and my horse went into canter and I panicked, which made her panic and we ended up doing, quite literally, the wall of death.

'I was pretty badly winded. I lay there for a couple of minutes and tried to get up but I couldn’t.

'We phoned for an ambulance but we were then called back to ask if there was a field for the air ambulance to land in.

'I think most people would rather not be strapped down on a board and flown to hospital.

'Since my first accident I have had to ride slightly differently and I am heavy on my right side so my balance isn’t as good.

'I could feel I was going to fall off and we were going flat out so probably travelling at about 25mph.

'Onlookers said I landed on my head and then flipped over and was then in heap.

'I was conscious so I remember it. I thought I had done my pelvis so I was just really nervous not knowing what injuries I had. I had so much adrenaline I don’t think the pain set in at first.

Kristine, pictured on the day of the accident, said she will get back in the saddle but will not ride Cher again after breaking her back twice in separate falls in two years

'My hat was in pieces so it really shows how important it is to wear a hat while riding.

'I just remember thinking I have got to get up, this can’t be happening again but my body just wouldn’t move.

'I won’t be riding Cher again which is sad but a friend of mine will be looking after her.'

Kristine returned home from hospital on December 2 and now needs to remain flat for 22 hours a day for six weeks to help her fracture recover.

She first broke her spine on July 27, 2011 when Cher, who weighs 70 stone, rolled on top of her before standing on her leg.

The graphic designer spent eight months undergoing intense physiotherapy before she recovered enough to carry on riding.

But despite her second scare she has vowed to carry on riding.

She said: 'I have thought long and hard about my future but I love horses and I want to carry on taking lessons.'

The equine centre declined to comment about Kristine’s accident.
