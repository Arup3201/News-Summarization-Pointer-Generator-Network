In recent years a handful of 'hybrid' animals have been spotted in the Arctic, such as this Polar bear Grizzly hybrid

In recent years a handful of 'hybrid' animals have been spotted in the Arctic but the number of these animals is set to increase, according to scientists.

U.S. researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change and now an artist has created images of what the animals at risk of crossbreeding might look like.

The scientists believe that as Arctic sea ice melts increasingly quickly, different species of animals such as bears and seals, which were previously kept apart by huge slabs of ice, are now mingling freely and breeding with each other.

In 2006 a white bear with brown patches thought to be a hybrid of a polar and grizzly bear was killed by Arctic hunters, while a hybrid of a white and a bowhead whale was sighted in the Bering Sea four years ago.

While crossbreeding might seem like a clever survival tactic, scientists from the University of Alaska have said that hybrid animals are often infertile.

The Hooded (right) and Harp (left) species of seal both breed on pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean and extend into the Arctic Ocean in summer months so they could easily meet and produce a hybrid pup

The scientists said a hybrid animal (illustrated) has already been confirmed by molecular analysis

Consequently the trend is worrying as cross breeding could drive certain species to extinction as they are no longer able to mate with their own kind, Business Insider reported.

The university's study of 34 species that are at risk of cross breeding was published in the journal Nature in 2010.

Artist Nickolay Lamm has created images of what hybrid Arctic animals might look like if they did breed together and the results in some cases are quite subtle.

U.S. researchers have blamed the increasing number of hybrid animals on climate change. Belugas (left) and narwhals (right) both inhabit the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas

He was helped by writer and biologist Dr Elin Pierce who described the features that the hybrid animals might have based on the dominant features of their distinct original species.

Dr Pierce shared his knowledge of the real hybrid animals sighted and photographed in the wild, to inform Mr Lamm's creations.

They include a hybrid of the Harp seal and Hooded seal, which appears to combine the two species' colouring.

brown bears (right), some of which are expanding northward, according to scientists

Polar, brown and grizzly bear hybrids have been noted in captivity and confirmed by molecular analysis in the wild. Pictured is an illustration of a brown and polar bear hybrid animal

Both types of seal breed on pack ice of the North Atlantic Ocean and extend into the Arctic Ocean in summer months so they could easily meet and breed.

The scientists said a hybrid animal has already been confirmed by molecular analysis and diminishing ice will encourage the species to overlap.

Dr Pierce and other researchers also noted that a hybrids of the Harbour porpoise and Dall's porpoise have been found off the coast of British Columbia, Canada.

Harbor seals (left) range widely in temperate and sub-Arctic waters of the North Pacific and North Atlantic and north into the Bering and Barents Seas. A Ringed seal is pictured right

The two species likely will move north where they will increasingly overlap with ringed seals, breeding to create a hybrid perhaps like the one illustrated

It is thought that this cross breeding occurred because of a very small population of Harbour porpoises, which are found in temperate to boreal seas in the North Atlantic and North Pacific.

Experts believe this species will move north as temperatures rise, which will further increase their chances of breeding with Dall's porpoises, which are found in the North Pacific

Harbour porpoises (left) are found in temperate to boreal seas in the North Atlantic and North Pacific and will likely
move north. Dall's Porpoises (right) are found in the North Pacific up to 65Â°N

Extensive hybridisation off the coast of British Columbia, Canada, has been attributed to locally low densities of Harbour porpoises. Similar hybridisation
may occur as the species interact in newly-colonized Arctic habitats where initial densities are likely to be low, scientists said. A Hybrid is illustrated

One of the most intriguing images of possible hybrid animals created by Mr Lamm, is the Beluga, Narwhal hybrid, which curiously does not have the narwhal's famous tusk.

Both species live in the Arctic Ocean and peripheral seas and a skull of a hybrid animals was collected in West Greenland in the 1980s, while local hunters have also reported seeing whales of intermediate form in the region.
