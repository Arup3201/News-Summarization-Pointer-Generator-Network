Protection: Parents and business will today be asked whether they want automatic online blocks to protect children from adult websites

Parents and business will today be asked whether they want automatic online blocks to protect children from adult websites.

The Government is canvassing views on an ‘opt-in’ system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available.

The move is a victory for the Daily Mail’s Block Online Porn campaign, which has called for the introduction of such content filtering systems.

There is growing alarm about the impact of sexual content on the internet on Britain’s children.

Just three per cent of pornographic websites require proof of age before granting access to sexually explicit material, and research suggests as many as one in three under-tens has seen pornography online.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport angered campaigners earlier this year by suggesting it was ruling out the idea of an automatic block on porn, on civil liberties grounds.

But following the Mail’s campaign, ministers have now included questions about the opt-in system in the public consultation document, launched today on the department’s website.

The consultation asks for views on the best way to shield children from internet pornography, and other adult and potentially harmful content.

These include websites promoting suicide, anorexia, gambling, self-harm and violence, as well as those exposing them to online sexual grooming or cyber-bullying.

As well as an automatic block on such content, another option under consideration is a less stringent ‘active choice’ system.

This would mean customers being asked about access to adult content when setting up an internet connection on devices including computers, phones and televisions.

It would list types of material and ask users to choose whether or not they want to see explicit sites.

Proposals: The Government launched a consultation paper an on 'opt-in' system, under which internet service providers would automatically block pornography unless an adult asked for it to be available

The third option, known as ‘active choice plus’, would be similar, presenting users with a list of possible online content.

But in this case, explicit sites would be marked as blocked as a default setting, unless the customer chose otherwise.

David Cameron last month said there was a
 clear case for looking at default blocks amid mounting concerns from 
child safety campaigners and MPs.

Currently, the opt-in system is being resisted by internet companies, which make millions from adverts for pornographic websites.

The Mail’s campaign has been backed 
by Deputy Children’s Commissioner Sue Berelowitz and Sara Payne, the 
mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah.

But ministers yesterday warned that no filter would be 100 per cent effective.

Children’s
 Minister Tim Loughton said: ‘Growing numbers of parents do not feel in 
control of what their families are exposed to online.

‘Many want to take responsibility, but all too often they do not know how because they find the technology too difficult to use or their children are more technically advanced then they are.

‘We have been clear that the internet industry needs to raise its game to equip families better in being able to block what their children access on the internet.’ 

Support: David Cameron last month said there was a clear case for looking at default blocks on explicit sites. The Mail's campaign has been backed by Sara Payne, right, the mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah

He added: ‘There is no silver bullet to solve this. No filter can ever be 100 per cent foolproof.

‘There is a cottage industry of people, mostly operating outside the UK, continually creating and proliferating “proxy” websites that provide links to adult and harmful content.

‘Automatic filtering on its own risks lulling parents into a false sense of security and there can never be any substitute for parents taking responsibility for how, when and where their children use the internet.’ 

The Government consultation will last ten weeks. Ministers will respond with their favoured option later this year.

The argument in favour of an opt-in system has been reinforced by a large study, conducted by the London School of Economics, which found that most parents have no idea what their children are looking at on the internet. 

Leading the way: How the Daily Mail has campaigned for the introduction of content filtering systems

Among parents of children who had admitted to researchers that they had looked at adult content, more than two thirds were certain their child had not, or said they did not know.

In addition, more than a quarter of children admitted ignoring warnings their parents gave them about harmful material on the internet.

Andrew Flanagan, head of the NSPCC, said: ‘Industry has done a huge amount in recent years and active choice is a step in the right direction.

‘But long term we back the next step which is the introduction of an opt-in filtering system for all internet accounts in the UK, if necessary, supported by Government regulation.

‘This will mean all new internet accounts will default automatically to a setting that blocks access to adult content. Over-18s can then request for this to be removed.’
