Jailed: Pensioner Margaret Harvey was sentenced to four weeks behind bars for stalking hospital boss Julia Bridgewater

A woman who harassed medical staff over her husband’s death has been jailed.

Margaret Harvey, 74, bombarded a hospital chief executive with late-night phone calls after her beloved Graham died of a heart attack.

She also traced the home of a retired cardiologist who had treated him – and then turned up at the front door armed with a wooden meat tenderiser.

Yesterday she was jailed for four weeks after staging a courtroom protest, but telling the judge: ‘I think to be honest I would be better going to prison.’

Mr Harvey, a retired PE teacher, died in March 2004 after having a heart attack at the wheel of his car. He had previously been treated for a heart attack while on holiday in France.

He was later diagnosed with angina at the University Hospital of North Staffordshire and put on a waiting list for an angiogram.

Following his death, his wife made a formal complaint against the hospital, saying doctors had failed to spot extensive scarring to the left ventricle of his heart and that he should have undergone a heart bypass. Inquiries were made by the health authority, the General Medical Council and the ombudsman but no fault was attached to the hospital.

Harvey, of Newcastle-under-Lyme, took out a number of private prosecutions which proved unsuccessful. Eventually she hired a private detective to trace the addresses and phone numbers of officials she felt ‘had the answers’ to her husband’s death.

In 2010, she armed herself with  a meat tenderiser and travelled 220 miles to confront Dr John Davis at his retirement home in Saltash, Cornwall.

She was later given a two-year restraining order and told not to contact him. Then, for a six-month period starting in November last year, she bombarded hospital chief executive Julia Bridgewater with phone calls demanding answers.

Mother-of-three Mrs Bridgewater – who did not even join the hospital management team until 2006 – was so frightened by the calls she asked police to fit panic alarms at her home. Despite being warned by police to stop, Harvey continued and was eventually arrested.

She told police she felt Mrs Bridgewater was the only person who could answer her questions, describing her as ‘corrupt’ and saying she phoned at night because it would have ‘maximum effect’.

In an interview before she was jailed, Harvey said: ‘I don’t regret what I did. I believe if my husband had been given proper treatment he would have had another ten years of life or more.

‘I want the hospital to admit the care was not good enough and I want the people responsible held to account.’

Harvey admitted harassment at North Staffordshire magistrates’ court and was jailed and given an indefinite restraining order barring her from contacting Mrs Bridge-water or going near her home.

District Judge David Taylor told Harvey: ‘I recognise that your motivation was to seek answers over what you see as wrongs relating to the death of your husband but  that right to protest is subject to the rule of law, no matter what we may feel about injustice.’
