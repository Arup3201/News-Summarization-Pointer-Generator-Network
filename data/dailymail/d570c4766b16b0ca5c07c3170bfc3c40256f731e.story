A 57-year-old man has been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard after he tried to paddle from California to Hawaii in a kayak.

The unidentified man, who had turned back to California, was spotted by a helicopter 11 days into his daring trek across the Pacific after some of his equipment malfunctioned.

He was found on Tuesday about 60 miles southwest of Santa Barbara's Point Conception after he sent out a distress call, the Coast Guard said in a statement.

The helicopter directed a Coast Guard cutter crew to the man, who was found in good health but 'lucky to be alive', the statement said.

Stranded: This 57-year-old man was rescued from the Pacific on Tuesday as he tried to paddle from California to Hawaii in a kayak. He had already turned back to California when he sent out a distress call

A friend of the man said he had left Monterey on May 30 attempting to make the voyage of nearly 2,400 miles to Honolulu in a kayak with a solar panel that charged all his electronic equipment.

The solar panel malfunctioned Saturday, and the man turned back. He sent out the distress call when he couldn't find his way.

The Coast Guard urged would-be mariners to file a float plan before taking long trips.

'A voyage from California to Hawaii is a long and treacherous journey for any vessel and exponentially more dangerous for a kayaker,' Petty Officer 2nd Class Timothy Hall said.

'His preparedness allowed him to call for help, but he is very lucky to be alive.'

Only one kayaker has completed the journey solo before - in 1987 - although man people have tried since, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Saved: The U.S. Coast Guard picked him up 60 miles southwest of Santa Barbara's Point Conception

Faulty: His electrical equipment was being charged by solar panels but these malfunctioned on Sunday. He turned back towards California but sent a distress call when he lost his way

Ed Gillet, from San 
Diego, took 63 days to complete the trip, and he arrived with an empty 
stomach and bloody hands from paddling. Relatives were 
worried that he had been lost at sea.

He used the sun to determine where he was along the journey.

'I
 knew exactly where I was every minute. My fear was that I was going so 
slowly I wouldnâ€™t make it to the islands before I starved,' Gillet, who is now a high school English teacher, said in an interview.

Several people
 have completed the stretch in a rowboat and a Great Pacific Race 
between rowboats is currently underway. The Coast Guard said the kayaker
 is not affiliated with the group.

The race, which is in its first year, is expected to take between one and three months to finish.
