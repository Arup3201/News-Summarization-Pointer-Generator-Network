Waitrose chief executive Mark Price said supermarkets may be forced to close because of major changes in Britain's shopping habits

Big supermarkets may be forced to close due to major changes in our shopping habits, the boss of Waitrose has warned.

Chief executive Mark Price predicts Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons will follow the trend of DIY giants B&Q and Homebase, which have announced store closures.

He argued that the rise of smaller stores combined with a move away from the big weekly grocery shop represents a change ‘as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the UK in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about’. 

Mr Price told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘This is as fundamental as supermarkets coming into the UK in the 1950s and reinventing what food shopping was all about,’ he said.

‘People are buying food for now. The notion that you are going to go and push a trolley around for the week is a thing of the past. It is fundamentally changing the market.

‘I think we are at one of those inflection points where customers are acting differently and retailers are going to have to respond to it.

‘Look at B&Q. Look at Homebase. I think that food is probably four or five years behind non-food.

‘What you have seen over the last five years is 12 per cent of non-food space taken out of the market. You have had no food space retired over that period. In fact what you have been seeing is food space growing by 3-5 per cent.

‘So, more and more space has been added at a time before you get the impact of internet, convenience shopping and all the other shifts that we talked about.’

In what has been dubbed an ‘end of the space race’, Sainsbury’s and Tesco have already cancelled the building of larger supermarkets.

Tesco mothballed a new £22million store in Chatteris, Cambridgeshire, and another in Immingham, Lincolnshire. It has also announced that a controversial development in Margate will not go ahead, despite a long battle to get planning permission.

The days of filling up the trolley for a weekly shop could soon be over, the Waitrose boss said

Last week Sainsbury’s announced 40 supermarket developments will not go ahead. A review of its business had found a quarter of existing stores are either the wrong size or in the wrong location. 

Mr Price’s comments come against the rising popularity of Aldi and Lidl, which operate from smaller stores with a reduced range of groceries, laced with some cheaper upmarket items.

Last week, Aldi announced it plans to more than double the number of UK stores, taking the total to 1,000. 

Lidl is embarked on a similar growth, while both say they are looking at opening a raft of smaller convenience stores in urban centres to catch the new shopping trend for regular top-ups on food. 

Joanne Denney-Finch, of the Institute for Grocery Distribution, said: ‘Convenience stores are benefiting from a cultural shift towards shopping little and often. They are increasingly providing products tailored to specific locations rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.’
