A New Jersey man offered to pay the ‘cannibal cop’ $5,000 to kidnap a woman so he could rape and kill her, U.S. officials alleged on Friday.

Federal authorities arrested Michael Vanhise, 23, at his home Friday morning and charged him with conspiracy to commit kidnapping with Gilberto Valle III, the former New York police officer who was arrested in October and charged with plotting to kidnap, torture, cook and eat dozens of women.

In a series of emails last year, Vanhise tried to bargain down the kidnapping fee and urged Valle to ‘just make sure she doesn't die before I get her,’ according to a criminal complaint released on Friday.

'Sick plans': Gilberto Valle was arrested in October and charged with planning to kidnap, torture, kill, cook and eat women. His list of potential victims allegedly named more than 100 women

‘No need to worry,’ Valle replied in an email, prosecutors allege. ‘She will be alive. It's a short drive to you.’

Vanhise, of Hamilton, New Jersey,  admitted to investigators that he sent the emails, prosecutors said

Valle, 28, nicknamed the ‘cannibal cop’ by New York media, was accused of targeting women whose names were discovered in a file on his computer. In November, he pleaded not guilty and said he was merely engaged in online fantasy role play.

Vanhise was charged with one count of conspiracy to commit kidnapping. He was expected to appear in court Friday afternoon.

The emails between the two men ‘read like a script from a bad horror film,’ Manhattan federal prosecutor Preet Bharara said Friday in a statement.

Vanhise was also accused of emailing photos and the home address of a girl from his neighborhood to two unnamed people, according to a criminal complaint, which said Vanhise solicited the girl's kidnapping.

Prosecutors said Vanhise tried to bargain down the price for the kidnapping to $4,000.

‘Could we do 4?’ Vanhise asked Valle in an email last February, according to the complaint.

‘I am putting my neck on the line here... $5,000 and you need to make sure that she is not found,’ Valle responded. ‘She will definitely make news.’

Online fantasy role play? Authorities charged last fall that Valle had undertaken surveillance of some of the women at their places of employment and their homes

Valle's estranged wife tipped off authorities after she discovered a disturbing file on his computer, a law enforcement official said at the time.

The file, called ‘Abducting and Cooking: A Blueprint,’ contained the names and pictures of at least 100 women, and the addresses and physical descriptions of some of them, according to court documents.

Authorities charged last fall that Valle had undertaken surveillance of some of the women at their places of employment and their homes.

Valle was denied bail by a judge who called the charges ‘profoundly disturbing.’

Both men face a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted. The case has disturbed even veteran criminal investigators.

‘No effort to characterize the defendant's actions is necessary,’ said FBI Assistant Director-in-Charge George Venizelos in a statement. ‘The factual allegations more than suffice to convey the depravity of the offense.’

Earlier this week it was reported that Valle has asked prosecutors to give him the names of 20 other suspected cannibals.

His lawyers insisted he needed to contact the alleged criminals to prepare his defense, since he was accused of being in league with them.
