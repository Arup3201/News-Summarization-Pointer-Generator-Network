The father of the woman raped by Ched Evans has pleaded for the former Sheffield United striker to stop trying to clear his name because it is 'destroying' his daughter. 

Evans released a video statement on Wednesday in which the 25-year-old offered no remorse, referred to the rape as 'an act of infidelity' against his girlfriend Natasha Massey and asked for a second chance in football.

The victim has been forced to leave her family and  change her name three times to escape death threats from supporters of Evans, and her father says the footballer must abandon his campaign.

‘Evans needs to apologise to my daughter rather than his girlfriend and to just shut the whole campaign down,' he says.

‘He’s shown no remorse and every time he makes some fresh appeal or comment, he draws attention to my daughter and risks her being identified and found.

‘She went into hiding because people were trying to track her down and kill her. There are only so many times you can keep changing your name. I don’t believe she’s that strong.’

Evans was jailed for five years in April 2012 for raping the 19-year-old waitress, who was judged to be too drunk to have given her consent to sex.

The victim has a right to lifelong anonymity, but her name was revealed on Twitter and retweeted more than 6,000 times by those backing Evans.

She has twice been uncovered despite being given a new identity, and her father insists all Evans cares about is returning to football.

‘She’s having to go from one place to another,' her father adds. 'What kind of an animal is he to sit there in that video and keep destroying her?

‘He’s not only raped my daughter but added insult to injury. He’s still hurting her now that he’s out with the things he’s saying.

‘Every time she moves she has to cut with her old friends and make new friends. She is living the life of a prisoner.

‘All Ched Evans cares about is his career. He doesn’t care about what he did, or my daughter. He’s never shown any remorse, it’s just lie after lie that comes out of his mouth.

‘It’s an insult to my daughter and to all rape victims out there. If you do the crime you should do the time. Two and a half years is very lenient and he shouldn’t be allowed to go back to his career as if nothing has happened.’ 

Striker Evans scored 42 goals in 103 appearances for Sheffield United during three seasons at the club

Evans' last club was  League One outfit Sheffield United before his imprisonment for rape in April 2012
