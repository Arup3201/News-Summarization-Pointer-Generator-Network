Tough boots saved a bricklayer’s feet when a 10-ton bus ran over them.

Doctors told Robert Phillips, 27, that they would have had to amputate them both, if his steel toe caps had not withstood the weight of the packed rush-hour single-decker.

His left tibia and fibula snapped, and his ankle twisted 180 degrees, leaving his left foot back to front.

But the feet themselves were completely unscathed, thanks to his super-strong size nines, even though the wheels went over them both.

Mr Phillips was walking home after his father dropped him off when the accident happened at 4.30pm on 12 February.

An Arriva bus ran over the toes of his right foot and his lower left leg and foot, knocking him to the ground at a pelican crossing near the corner of Bangor Road and High Street, close to his home in Johnstown, Wrexham, North Wales.

He fell against railings and landed on the road in front of the bus. Its front wheels went over him but stopped with just inches to spare before the rear ones crushed him.

‘A woman driver put a blanket over me and I was taken to Wrexham Maelor Hospital. I was there for six hours but my injuries were so severe they sent me to University Hospital of North Staffordshire at Stoke-on-Trent.’

Lisa Valentine, 23, of Ruabon, Wrexham, was on the scene moments after the accident.She said: ‘When I went out there was a lad lying on the floor and he was screaming.

Damaged: The left windscreen of the Number 2 Arriva bus was cracked when it hit bricklayer Robert Phillips

Police closed the road last month in Wrexham when bricklayer Robert Phillips was hit by a bus that ran over his feet but left them unscathed because of his steel toe-capped boots

‘He was in pain and he was getting gas and air from paramedics before they put him in the ambulance.

‘It looked like he had broken his leg.

‘The windscreen of the bus was smashed but he was lying at the back so I’m not sure if he was dragged by the bus.’

Mr Phillips has had a series of four operations so far, and doctors say it will be at least 15 months before the bones heal.

‘My tibia and fibula broke, my ankle was smashed to pieces and the whole left foot spun round 180 degrees,’ he said.

‘The doctors say I’m very lucky to have my feet. If I hadn’t been wearing steel toe-capped boots I would have lost them for sure. Thankfully they withstood the weight of the bus.

‘My feet don’t have a mark on them. I always wear proper work boots. I pay extra to get good ones, Scruffs, which are strong and comfy.’

Mr Phillips, who lives with girlfriend Stacey Roberts, 21, and son Evan, two, was discharged on March 3.

He’s now on crutches but can’t leave his home because the open wound is prone to infection.He has a metal cage built around it, which will be replaced in future operations.

‘I don’t let it get me down,’ he said. ‘I’m very happy to be here at all, and to have my legs and my feet is a bonus.‘The docs said it was only thanks to medical advances in the last 10 years that they were able to save my leg.’

Mr Phillips was in such pain after his accident that he was twice given ketamine, a horse tranquilizer and used illegally in nightclubs.

‘I was tripping and talking gibberish,’ he said. ‘It was horrible.’

Mr Phillips wrote to Scruffs Workwear, the firm that made his boots, and told them they had saved his feet. They are sending him a new pair.

Spokesman Chris Mellor-Dolman said: ‘All of our products are put through rigorous safety tests, and we’re not surprised that they stood up to a ten ton bus. Our gear is usually more at home on a work site, but it just goes to show that they can play hard too.’

A spokesman for Arriva Bus Midlands, which operates the service, said: ‘We are pleased to hear the good news regarding Mr Phillips and we wish him a speedy recovery following the incident in Johnstown.’

By a strange coincidence Mr Phillips’s father Nigel, 52, wasn’t so lucky with his boots. They failed to withstand the pressure in a forklift truck accident back in 1985. The toecap caved in, crushing half his right foot and he had to have it amputated. He managed to return to work though, as a roofer.
