Staff at a Sea Life centre are giving new meaning to the phrase 'trout pout' as they offer visitors a kiss from one of its residents with a serious case of fish lips.

Gary the giant Gourami likes nothing better than to pucker up for anyone who passes his tank.

And the amorous fish is not sort of attention as a steady stream of admirers are seemingly unable to resist his permanently pouting lips.

Gary has become a hit with the ladies at the Hunstanton Sea Life Sanctuary in Norfolk - not just with visitors but with members of staff.

Pucker up: Sanctuary worker Mary Belle offers a kiss to Gary the giant Gourami... and the fish happily obliges

Women working at the centre have developed the ritual of bending down for a kiss through the glass each time they pass his tank.

Gary, a giant Gourami from Indonesia measuring nearly 28 inches long, never fails to return the gesture.

Nigel Croasdale, manager of the centre, said: 'They don't seem able to go past Gary's tank without stopping for a quick smooch, and Gary seems to love it.'

Gary, who has been at the centre for six months, is one of several waifs and strays currently on display there.

The freshwater species is native to Indonesia and a popular food fish in India, but many people keep them as pets (file picture)

He was brought to the sanctuary by a member of the public who had kept him as a pet but became overwhelmed by his appetite - he would guzzle a leftover Sunday dinner every weekend.

The freshwater species is a popular food fish in India but many people keep them as pets. Their preference for eating vegetation has led to them being used to clear weed from rivers and lakes.

They are also capable of breathing moist air, so can survive out of water for long periods.

Giant Gourami are one of the most common species requiring rehousing from home aquariums.

Displays supervisor Kieran Copeland added: 'They are often found in pet shops measuring just a few inches long, and people buy them without realising how big they grow, and how quickly.'

The sanctuary is supporting The Big Fish Campaign, launched by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums, in an attempt to deter shops from selling the so-called 'tank busters'.
