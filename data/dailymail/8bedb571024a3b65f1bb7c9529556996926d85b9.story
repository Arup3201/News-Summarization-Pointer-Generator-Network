This is the moment a crocodile clamped its jaws around a trainer's head during a stunt that went awry at a Thai tourist attraction.

Screams can be heard from the audience in footage of the 27-year-old's brush with death at the Samut Prakan Crocodile Farm in Bangkok on Sunday.

It shows the trainer cautiously approaching the reptile before placing his head inside its gaping mouth - only for the deadly crocodile to suddenly snap its jaws shut and violently thrash the man from side to side.

Hairy moment: Tourists watched in horror as the crocodile snapped its jaws shut while the man's head was inside in Thailand

The man was flung around repeatedly before the crocodile released him at the farm.

Crocodile shows are a popular attraction
in Thailand, where trainers wow crowds by seemingly 
defying death putting their heads in the creature's mouths.

Incredibly, the farm worker escaped virtually unscathed.

According to the Bangkok Post it is 
unusual for the creature to have released its grip on the trainer, who 
it said has been in the job for eight years.

The newspaper said he sustained head wounds.

The accident was said to be the first to occur at the farm.
