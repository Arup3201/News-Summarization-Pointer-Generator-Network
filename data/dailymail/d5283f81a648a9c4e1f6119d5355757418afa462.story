A lucky hillwalker was given a personal air show by the most famous aerobatics team in the world when he witnessed a training session by the RAF's Red Arrows.

Dave Savage, 43, was enjoying a peaceful walk through the Mach Loop hills in central Wales when the stillness of his surroundings was broken by the roar of the afterburner jet engines from the iconic aircraft.

The nine-plane flying team were using the area to practice low-level flying ahead of this summer's air shows, allowing Mr Savage to get some of the first pictures of their new Union Flag tail design, painted on to mark their 50th anniversary.

The father-of-three said: 'It was spectacular, exciting, noisy and totally unforgettable. It was like they were putting on a show just for me.

'It was such a buzz when the planes went screaming past. Sometimes I didn't even lift my camera up because I was just standing there in amazement.'

The Red Arrows had left their base in Lincolnshire in singles before flying through the loop - named after the nearby town of Machynlleth - and then heading back to their headquarters.

Mr Savage, from Newtown, Powys, was able to climb up the hillside so he was higher than the Red Hawk T1 aircraft which were at times just 200ft above the ground

Mr Savage said: 'I've always been aircraft mad and I've seen the Red Arrows in airshows up and down the country. But this was the closest I've ever been to them - I could see the pilots quite clearly'

The aerobatics team were practicing low-level flying in the Welsh hills, and buzzed hill walkers at speeds of up to 500mph

Mr Savage, who said the experience was like having his own personal air show, was just yards from some of the passing aircraft

The Red Arrows, officially the Royal Air Force Aerobatic Team, performed their first display on May 6, 1965 at Little Rissington, Gloucestershire.

Now numbering nine members – all volunteers – they have appeared at events in more than 50 countries around the world showcasing the skills of RAF pilots.

The planes are painted red for health and safety reasons – red being most visible in the sky – although officially it is in tribute to the Red Pelicans, their predecessors as an air aerobatic team.

The Red Arrows whose motto is Éclat, meaning brilliance, have been based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire since December 21, 2000.

Three pilots are changed every year, so that there are always three first-year pilots, three second-year pilots, and three in their final year.

The pilots always fly in the same place in the formation and if one is unwell then they fly in an eight-man formation.

However, if the lead pilot is unable to fly, then the team's performance is cancelled.

In 2010 Flt Lt Kirsty Moore became the first female Red Arrow pilot.

Mr Savage's photos are thought to be among the first to show the Red Arrows aircraft with their new Union Flag tail colours, which they have had painted on to celebrate their 50th display season

Unveiling the new design earlier this year, Squadron Leader Jim Turner said: 'We are extremely proud of our heritage and we hope this tailfin design brings with it a sense of pride for both past members of the team and for members of the public to share'

After taking the incredible close-up photos, Mr Savage said: 'I have explained to friends what it is like but its not you have to be there to get the full thrill. I would recommend it to anyone just to experience it once in their life'

The team will put on 85 displays in nine countries during the 2014 display season, which runs from the end of May until the close of September

Many of the pilots have recent frontline experience with the RAF and use skills gained during combat training during the hair-raising routines
