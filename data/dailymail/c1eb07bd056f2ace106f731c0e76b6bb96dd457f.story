'The homeowner saw a male suspect fleeing the residence and the homeowner was able to detain the suspect until police arrived,' said Sabrina Boston, of McKinney police.

It was determined that Kessler was not a burglar and was at the home to have sexual relations with a 15-year-old resident who lived there.

'We feel very confident the victim was never a student of Mr Kessler's,' Ms Boston added.

Police said used he used the popular male-only hookup app Grindr to meet the boy on at least four occasions for sexual relations, without let the teenager know that he was HIV-positive.

The smartphone apps bills itself as 'the largest and most popular all-male location-based social network out there', but has earned a reputation as a place for men who are looking for sex to connect with others.

Court documents reveal that Kessler even logged on to Grindr and showed police officers at the scene a series of text messages he had exchanged with the boy since meeting on the app.

'I am totally shocked,' said Joanne Jordan, one of Kessler's neighbors, who described him as a 'very nice guy'.

The principal at RISD Academy posted a letter on their website saying Kessler has been a teacher there for 14 years with no history of complaints of this nature.

The statement added that the music teacher has been placed on administrative leave, pending the resolution of the situation.
