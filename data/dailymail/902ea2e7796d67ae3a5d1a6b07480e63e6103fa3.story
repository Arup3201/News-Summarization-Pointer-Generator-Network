Damion Murray, 27, who has been jailed for seven years after police found a loaded hand gun hidden in a breakfast cereal box during a drugs raid at a Birmingham flat

A drug dealer has been jailed after police raided his flat and found a loaded gun hidden in a box of breakfast cereal.

Damion Murray, 27, concealed the revolver inside a box of Nestle Cheerios which he hid on the top of his fridge.

Officers stormed the ground floor flat in Balsall Heath, Birmingham, following a tip-off that drugs were being dealt from the property.

They found a loaded handgun wrapped in a green bandana and placed inside the box of £3.19p multigrain hoops.

Sixteen wraps of heroin and cocaine were also found in his bedroom along with £2,500 in cash.

A court was told Murray was overheard bragging to friends at a party that he was recruited to be a drug runner.

West Midlands Police uncovered phone records linking the painter and decorator to drug dealing activity across the city.

Murray was found guilty of supplying Class A drugs with intent to supply following a two day trial last week.

At Birmingham Crown Court, Murray was jailed for seven years.

After the case, Detective Constable Darren English, from Birmingham CID, said: 'The court saw through his lies and convicted him and we are pleased with the sentencing outcome.

'The evidence supplied to the court was overwhelming and proved that Murray was connected to drug dealing and had links to a local gang.

'Getting guns and gangs off our streets is a priority for West Midlands police and this gun has now been destroyed.

'I would appeal to anyone affected drug crime to have confidence and report criminality to the police where we can act upon your concerns.'

During the search police found the loaded gun wrapped in a bandana and concealed in a multigrain hoop cereal box on top of the fridge
