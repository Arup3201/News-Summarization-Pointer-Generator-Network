Cold weather is driving the cost of Super Bowl tickets to the lowest level in at least two years as fans wince at the thought of shivering in temperatures of around 20F next Sunday.

The cheapest ticket on ticket exchange Stub Hub was $1,277.50 at midday today.

That has fallen even further than yesterday when ESPN calculated that a $1,779 ticket was $409 cheaper than at the same time last year and  $809 than in 2012.

However NFL officials remain unconcerned about both turnout and takings - the most expensive ticket on offer is a suite for a cool $686,720.

Forecasters are predicting one of the coldest Super Bowls in recent memory this year as a second block of arctic air hovers over New York and New Jersey. Temperatures are expected to hover around 30F all week and there is now a 30 per cent chance of snow on Super Bowl Sunday.

The venue, Met Life stadium in New Jersey is also open to the elements meaning a potentially uncomfortable experience for the majority of fans who will not be in heated suites.

There is even speculation that the game could be postponed if faced with heavy snow - an outcome that would surely bring questions about the decision to hold the game in an uncovered stadium in the North East.

Superstars: Peyton Manning and Richard Sherman are among the draws at the Super Bowl as the cheapest ticket nears $1,000

The last two Super Bowls have been held in temperature-controlled domes in Indianapolis and New Orleans. 

However experts say that other factors are also conspiring to drive the cost of tickets down. Both the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks are based on the others side of the country, making an impulsive decision to attend the game harder to make.

Prices were also talked up in the months before the game, with many predicting that the combination of the wealth of the New York area and two exciting finals teams would push the minimun ticket price to $3,000.

Analyst Ram Silverman, of Golden Tickets in Plano Texas told ESPN: 'The price has to get down to that point where people will say, 'I'm going even if my team isn't in it. There are millions of people in the tri-state area who have the money to do it, and some of them are going to say, 'I just don't care about the weather for that price.''
