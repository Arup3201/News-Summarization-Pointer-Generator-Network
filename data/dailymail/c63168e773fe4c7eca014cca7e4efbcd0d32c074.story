The fully-released 911 call from a mother, who cradled a dying teenage boy with multiple stab wounds, has revealed horrific details of the victim's injuries.

Lucas Cavanaugh, 17, was repeatedly knifed on Sunday in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, allegedly by the boyfriend of a girl he had sent a Snapchat message.

The girl's mother, Robynn Davis, was the first to find the teenager lying wounded outside her home and made a hysterical call to 911.

She wept to the dispatcher: 'He's been stabbed multiple times. It's everywhere [the blood].... He's on his side and his intestines are hanging outside of his body... He's taking deep, deep breathes... He's disemboweled.'

Lucas Cavanaugh, 17, passed away on Sunday after being stabbed multiple times allegedly by the boyfriend of a girl he had sent a Snapchat message 

Ms Davis begged the victim, identified as 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh, not to die, as she urged police to hurry as the alleged attacker, 16-year-old Matthew Fischer, was still on the loose.

According to the recording, Ms Davis can be heard saying: 'He's in the house, he's somewhere. He's my daughter's boyfriend.'  

She can be heard on the eight-minute tape reassuring the teenage boy and pleading with him. 

'Lucas, baby, please, oh God. Are you alive? Yes, you are. Please, please let's make it.

'He's got a pulse and he is breathing but he's completely unconscious. He has been stabbed right in his stomach,' she added to the 911 dispatcher.    

Matthew Fischer, 16, has been charged with murder over the fatal stabbing of classmate, 17-year-old Lucas Cavanaugh, on Sunday in Park West, South Carolina

An incident report released by police on Tuesday described how an officer responding to the scene found Cavanaugh lying in the middle of the street with a stomach wound and two women sitting near him. 

The stabbing allegedly took place because a teenage girl's boyfriend was upset about a Snapchat message sent by the victim.

Matthew Joseph Fischer, 16, of Mount Pleasant was visiting his girlfriend's home in Park West near Charleston, South Carolina on Sunday when he saw a message from Cavanaugh on her iPod, detectives said.

The message was sent through Snapchat, a photo-and-text app on which messages are visible for only a brief time.

The message angered Fischer, according to an arrest affidavit. Officials have not released details about the content of the message.

'The defendant took the iPod and contacted the victim. Words were exchanged at which point the defendant told the victim 'Come over 'and 'I'll kill you man,' the affidavit said.

Cavanaugh, of nearby Sullivan's Islands, came to the girl's house, and the two fought, authorities said.

'During the altercation, the defendant produced a knife from his right pant pocket and proceeded to stab the victim in the torso, resulting in death,' the affidavit said. 

One of the women brought the officer a knife and identified it as the weapon, according to the report. 

She said a youth had come to her house with a bloody knife shortly after the incident, dropped the knife and run off.

Fischer was later arrested at the scene while sitting in his mother's car, authorities said. He was forced out of the car at gunpoint and taken into custody. 

Fischer is charged as an adult with murder and possession of a knife. He was denied bond on Monday. He and Cavanaugh attended Wando High School. 

The teenager's body will be laid to rest on Friday after a private funeral at The Holy Cross Episcopal Church on Sullivan's Island.

The family held a public visitation on Thursday and the night before, the teen's friends gathered on a local beach to bid farewell to him, releasing balloons and lanterns and covering his beloved car in flowers.

The 17-year-old was remembered as 'well-liked, kind and a free spirit' with a passion for cars which he channeled into restoring his 1981 corvette. He wanted to go on to study automotive engineering and design at the University of Cincinnati.

'It's been a tough time for me and my family,' said his father, David Cavanaugh, ABC reported. 

'But what you all did for Luke is just so wonderful. And no matter how dark this time is right now I am just so touched to see everyone come here. 

I had no idea that Luke touched so many people. Sometimes as a father you just don't see that. Luke was a good kid.'
