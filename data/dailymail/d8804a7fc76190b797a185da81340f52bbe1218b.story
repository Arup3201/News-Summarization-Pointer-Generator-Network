Republican leaders again urged President Barack Obama to sign legislation approving the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline at a ceremony on Friday at which House Speaker John Boehner officially lent his own name to the bill.

The White House has steadfastly promised to veto the legislation when it arrives at the Oval Office - a vow it reiterated on Thursday. 

Congressional Republicans hope to use Obama's opposition to building the pipeline that they say would create 42,000 jobs as a cudgel against the Democratic President.

After listing the benefits of building the oil transportation system at today's press conference, Boehner told the president, 'Do the right thing. Sign this bill, and help us create more jobs in America and help us create a healthier economy.'

Boehner's signature is seen on the Keystone XL Pipeline Approval Act as well as that of Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, President of the Senate Tempore. The hotly debated Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline cleared final Congressional approval and was bound for the desk of President Barack Obama, who has vowed to veto the law

The Republican House Speaker was flanked at the formal enrollment ceremony by Sean McGarvey, President of the North America's Building Trades Unions, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, and the bill's author, North Dakota Sen. John Hoeven, among other Republican members of Congress from states that would be directly affected by the realization of the XL portion of the transnational conduit.

'We're hoping common sense will prevail here, and the president will sign this extraordinary jobs bill,'  McConnell said.

Both the House and the Senate have OK'd the Keystone expansion multiple times yet never with enough votes to override Obama's promised vetoes.

A House vote on Wednesday to pass the latest Senate bill drew 29 Democrats and passed 270 to 152, falling 20 votes short of what was needed. 

The president first said he would not sign the bill because the pathway of the pipeline was in dispute. Even after a Nebraska court sided with the system's makers, Obama said he would leave it to the State Department to approve or deny TransCanada's permit request.

A White House spokesman confirmed on Thursday that Obama had not changed his mind. 

'As you know, the approval process for this pipeline is one that predates this administration, and is hubbed at the State Department. We're going to let that process unfold,' Obama spokesman Eric Schultz told reporters travelling with the president.

'The President has announced that he would oppose and veto any legislative maneuvering to circumvent that process. So he will indeed be vetoing it.'

The State Department paused its review process last spring as it awaited the verdict of the Nebraska Supreme Court and has not publicly announced plans to restart it.

Not gonna happen: The White House has said in no uncertain terms that Obama won't lend his name to the Keystone XL expansion bill and anxious lawmakers will just have to wait for the State Department to resume its stalled review of the permit request for the oil transportation system

Though Boehner signed the bill today he will not immediately send it to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Following Monday's federal holiday, Congress is scheduled to be in recess for the remainder of the week.

Hoeven told reporters on Thursday the legislative branch would wait until it resumed its activities to present Obama with the document 'so attention is brought to it' when he rejects it.

The White House would not say on Thursday if Obama would make a statement to the press announcing his decision or if he would issue a written statement. 

Republicans' inability to force the bill into law, despite having majorities in both chambers of Congress and the support of more than three dozen of their colleagues across the aisle, highlighted the struggle the GOP faces during Obama's last two years in office. 

'Now we have the Senate and so our constituents think "now you can stop Obama". Well we don't have 60,' Florida Rep. Tom Rooney told the Associated Press on Thursday, referring to the number of votes it takes in the Senate to overcome a minority party filibuster. 

'Honestly it's going to continue to frustrate not only our side but the people who elected us that nothing is going to change until we get a new president,' he said, acknowledging the virtual stalemate.
