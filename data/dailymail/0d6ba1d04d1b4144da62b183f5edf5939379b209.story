Jailed: Possessive Kelly Farrugia, 19, brutally knifed Kirsty Brown, 25, after checking through her mobile phone as she slept

A jealous teenage lesbian who twice stabbed her older lover with a six inch kitchen knife after accusing her of being unfaithful has been jailed for five years.

Possessive Kelly Farrugia, 19, brutally knifed Kirsty Brown, 25, after checking through her mobile phone as she slept.

Farrugia left Miss Brown in a pool of blood and refused to call an ambulance despite her lover begging her for help.

Miss Brown suffered two puncture 
wounds to her chest after the horrific attack at their home in 
Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire on December 10 last year.

Farrugia
was convicted of wounding with intent and was jailed for five years in 
youth custody at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Thursday.

Sentencing her Judge Paul Glenn said: 'The two of you were jealous and possessive, and you argued together frequently.

'There have been previous incidents where things have become physical between you.

'She fell asleep on the sofa, and you took her phone out of her pocket and began to interrogate it.

'You accused her of infidelity - something she denied.

'She turned to go upstairs to bed. At that stage you took a kitchen knife and stabbed her twice with it.

'Having been injured, she asked you to call an ambulance, but you made no effort to assist her.

'She had two stab wounds in the torso. There were two separate strikes with the knife.

'Fortunately there was no damage within her abdomen, although she did need an operation.'

James Dixon, defending, told the court that Farrugia had shown good qualities since she was arrested.

He said: 'She has been working with her mother on a market stall three days a week.

'This has meant getting up at 4.30am to get to the market. That shows she has a very positive future in terms of her conduct.

'That demonstrates a lot in terms of her attitude.'

Judge Glenn said he agreed that the defendant had made some positive strides, but told her she would inevitably face a lengthy prison sentence.

He added: 'I accept the view of the probation officer, that you pose a risk to future partners. But you are a person with good qualities.

'I am impressed that you have continued to be industrious, despite having this hanging over you.'
