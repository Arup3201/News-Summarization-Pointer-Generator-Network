Financial windfall: Mark Zuckerberg's personal fortune has soared a staggering $3.8 billion since Facebook announced impressed Q2 results on Wednesday

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s personal fortune soared a staggering $3.8 billion between the company’s announcement of much better than expected second quarter earnings on Wednesday and the close of trading on Thursday.

Shares in the world’s most-popular 
social-networking service soared 30% to their highest level since May 
2012, earning the company’s founder and CEO the equivalent of $15.83 
million per hour.

When Facebook floated on the Nasdaq in 
May last year it was one of the largest initial public offerings in
history, netting co-creator Zuckerberg more than a billion dollars.

But its share price fell dramatically months later and it saw $49 billion wiped from its value.

Surging demand for mobile advertising helped company revenues increase 53 percent to $1.81 billion for the latest quarter.

The
earnings may quell concerns, voiced by analysts and investors since the
IPO, that the rising popularity of smartphones and tablets is outpacing
its ability to make money selling promotions to mobile users.

No word yet on if the famously frugal Zuckerberg has celebrated his latest windfall.

The billionaire is known for his life of the simple life, shunning material possessions to live a relatively simple existence and nearly always  wearing his trademark hoodies.

Instead, he and wife Priscilla have committed the majority of their wealth to charity.

This weeks windfall has pushed the 29-year-old far up the Bloomberg Billionaires Index ahead of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and Dell chairman Michael Dell.

Zuckerberg ranked at No. 42 with a net worth of $16.8 billion. He was number 75 before the latest Facebook earnings were released and so far this year his net worth has swelled by 37%.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, 57, remains the richest person in the world with a net worth of $72.2 billion, followed by Mexico’s Carlos Slim, 73, and then Warren Buffett, 82.

On Wednesday Facebook saw its second 
quarter revenue soar to $1.813 billion - a 53 percent increase on the 
same period last year.

Up 
until this week, the company had been accused of delivering a mediocre 
return since going public in May 2012, but that all changed on Wednesday
when its value jumped 20 per cent to $31.81 during after-hours trading.

Facebook made $333m in
net income from April to June compared with a net loss of $157m a year 
ago, according to the company's latest financial results.

An
average of 699 million people used the social media platform every day 
in June, an increase of 27 percent on the same time last year.

The number of monthly users accessing 
Facebook on mobile devices - including smartphones and tablets - rose by
51 percent year on year to 819 million in June.

Facebook
founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said: 'We've made good 
progress growing our community, deepening engagement and delivering 
strong financial results, especially on mobile.

'The
work we've done to make mobile the best Facebook experience is showing 
good results and provides us with a solid foundation for the future.'

Facebook
said it made $1.6 billion of revenue from advertising, which was 88 per 
cent of total revenue and a 61 percent increase from the same quarter 
last year.

Mobile ad cash made up 41 per cent of advertising revenue for the first quarter of 2013, it added.

Introducing
video to Instagram, the photo-sharing and editing platform Facebook 
paid a billion dollars for last year, saw five million videos uploaded 
in the first 24 hours, the company said.
