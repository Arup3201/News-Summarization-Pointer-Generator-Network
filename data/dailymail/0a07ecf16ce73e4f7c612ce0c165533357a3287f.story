It now appears that the fate of Hostess Brands Inc has been sealed after the maker of Twinkies and Ding Dongs said late Tuesday that it failed to reach an agreement with its second-biggest union.

As a result, Hostess plans to continue with a hearing on Wednesday in which a bankruptcy court judge in White Plains, New York, will decide if the company can shutter its operations.

The renewed talks between Hostess and The Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union came after the company declared last week that it would move to wind down its business and start selling off its assets in bankruptcy court.

Failure: Last-minute talks between Hostess and its striking union broke down just hours before a judge is expected to make a decision on whether to allow the company to shutter its operations

Within hours of Friday's announcement that Hostess was going out of business, there was a rush on buying their products

The company cited a crippling strike 
that was started on November 9 by the union, which represents 30 per 
cent of Hostess workers.

After making its case to liquidate on 
Monday, the bankruptcy court judge noted that the two sides hadn't yet 
tried resolving their differences through private mediation.

The judge noted that 18,000 jobs were
on the line and urged the company and union to try to resolve their 
differences. Both sides agreed to hold mediation proceedings on Tuesday.

‘Many people, myself included, have 
serious questions as to the logic behind this strike,’ said Judge Robert
Drain, who heard the case in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in the Southern 
District of New York.

‘Not to have gone through that step leaves a huge question mark in this case.’

In a statement late Tuesday, Hostess 
said it would not comment on the breakdown in talks other than to say 
that mediation ‘was unsuccessful.’ A lawyer for the bakers union said he
had no comment, citing mediation ground rules.

Hostess shut down its three dozen plants late last week after it said the strike by the bakers union hurt its ability to maintain normal production.

The union said the company's demise was the result of years of mismanagement, however, and that workers have already given steep concessions over the years.

Hostess, weighed down by management turmoil, rising labor costs and Americans' changing tastes, is making its second trip through Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring.

Shortage: Hostress Brands quickly sold out after news spread that the company was going out of business

Hostess Brands and its striking union have agreed to mediation talks after an intervention by a bankruptcy judge

The company, based in Irving, Texas, 
had brought on CEO Gregory Rayburn as a restructuring expert in part to 
renegotiate its contract with labor unions.

The company reached an agreement with 
its biggest union, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, on a 
contract that dramatically reduced pension contributions, as well as 
slashing wages and health benefits. But the company said the bakers 
union stopped returning its calls about a month ago.

The Teamsters urged the smaller union 
to hold a secret ballot on whether members wanted to continue striking. 
Many workers in the bakers union decided to cross picket lines last week
but Hostess said it wasn't enough to keep operations at normal levels.

Teamsters General Secretary Ken Hall 
said the failure of the mediation talks Tuesday and the likely 
shuttering of the company was a 'tragic outcome' for Hostess workers.

Rayburn said that Hostess was already 
operating on razor thin margins and that the strike was the final blow. 
The bakers union meanwhile pointed to the steep raises executives were 
given last year as the company was spiraling down toward bankruptcy.

The company's announcement last week 
that it would move to liquidate prompted a rush on Hostess treats across
the country, with many businesses selling out of Twinkies within hours.

Was it all in vain? On Friday Michelle Craft bought $100 worth of Hostess treats in Denver, but now it looks like the company might not go out of business afterall

Demand: there were long lines outside the Hostess store in Denver when the company announced its demise on Friday

Even if Hostess goes out of business, its popular brands will likely find a second life after being snapped up by buyers.

The company says several potential 
buyers have expressed interest in the brands. Although Hostess' sales 
have been declining in recent years, the company still does about 
$2.5billion in business each year. Twinkies alone brought in $68million 
so far this year.

It's not the sequence of events that 
the maker of Twinkies, Ding Dongs and Ho Ho's envisioned when it filed 
for bankruptcy in January, its second Chapter 11 filing in less than a 
decade.

The company, who said that it was 
saddled with costs related to its unionized workforce, had hoped to 
emerge with stronger financials. It brought on Rayburn as a 
restructuring expert and was working to renegotiate its contract with 
labor unions.

But 
Rayburn wasn't able to reach a deal with the bakery union. The company, 
which had been contributing $100million a year in pension costs for 
workers, offered workers a new contract that would've slashed that to 
$25million a year, in addition to wage cuts and a 17 per cent reduction 
in health benefits. But the bakery union decided to strike.

The
quintessential junk food treat - a cream-filled, 150-calorie sponge 
cake - has been called the 'cream puff of the proletariat' and the 'snack with a snack in the middle.' It had faced extinction after its 
maker, Hostess Brands, announced plans to liquidate amid a dispute with 
striking bakers.* James A. Dewar, a manager for the 
Continental Baking Co, came up with the idea in 1930 after seeing the 
machines that made shortcakes with strawberry filling sit idle at the 
bakery when strawberries were out of season. He injected the elongated 
sponge cake with banana filling - vanilla would be used later - and 
called it a Twinkie after seeing a billboard for the Twinkle Toe Shoe 
Company. Dewar, who died in 1985 at age 88, said he ate at least two 
packets of Twinkies a week.* 
Twinkies were scorned by nutritionists as the archetypal unhealthy snack
and became a comic's punch line, but somebody was eating them. Hostess 
was able to manufacture 1,000 a minute at its bakeries and in 2005 the 
Washington Post said Americans had bought $47 million worth of Twinkies 
in the previous year.* Many jokes about Twinkies play off
their longevity thanks to their ample chemical preservatives. There has
been much speculation about how many decades a Twinkie can sit on a 
shelf before being eaten. For the sake of freshness, Theresa Cogswell of
the Twinkies' parent company Hostess, has said that no more than 25 
days was ideal but a Maine college professor gained notoriety by keeping
one atop his blackboard for 30 years. He said it still looked good.*
In 2000 President Bill Clinton's White House Millennium Council put 
together a time capsule in order to give people in 2100 an idea of how 
we lived. Its contents included historic items such as a piece of the 
Berlin Wall, film of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon, a U.S. World 
War Two soldier's helmet, a photo of civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks and
a Twinkie.* The trial of San Francisco city supervisor 
Dan White, who fatally shot the mayor and another supervisor in 1978, 
gave rise to what came to be known as the 'Twinkie defense.' The defense
said White was suffering mental problems, as evidenced by the way he 
had given up his healthy lifestyle and started eating junk food. The 
defense argued that this behavior was an indication of his instability. 
White ended up serving five years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.*
Twinkies' surge in popularity in the 1950s was partially attributed to 
its ads on 'The Howdy Doody Show' directed at kids, who demanded the 
desserts in their lunch boxes.* Hostess collected recipes
from connoisseurs to publish the 'The Twinkies Cookbook' in 2006. The 
50 recipes included Twinkie-based burritos, lasagna, tiramisu, 
milkshakes and sushi (with dried fruit rather than fish). Deep-fried 
Twinkies have been a staple at U.S. state fairs.*
The Twinkie has a long list of television and movie credits. Archie 
Bunker always had one in his lunch on the sitcom 'All in the Family' and
they have been featured in the animated series 'Family Guy' and 'The 
Simpsons.' A character in 'The Deer Hunter' eats Twinkies dipped in 
mustard. In the wacky comedy 'Ghostbusters' a scientist tracking demons 
calculates that the level of 'psychokinetic energy' in New York City 
could normally be as big as a Twinkie but things had become so bad that 
that Twinkie would now be 35 feet long and weigh 600 pounds (about 270 
kg).* Twinkies are just part of the Hostess snack food 
family. Other well-known treats from the company include Ding Dongs, Ho 
Hos, Suzy Q's, Sno Balls, Zingers and Drake's cakes.*
Twitter and other social media were filled with laments about a 
Twinkie-less world on Friday. Entrepreneurs and speculators turned to 
eBay. A box of 10 Twinkies was being offered on the online auction site 
for a starting bid of $500. 'What better way to say, "I love you" than 
with the gift of an American icon that will be gone soon,' the seller 
said.
