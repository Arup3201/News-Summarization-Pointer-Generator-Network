Former Germany manager Rudi Voller has backed Lukas Podolski to rediscover his best form once he has sorted out his club future.

Podolski was a World Cup winner in the summer but has struggled to get a game at Arsenal, and Germany coach Joachim Loew has admitted the situation is jeopardising his place in the national team.

The former Cologne and Bayern Munich forward is to thrash out his future with the Gunners this winter with a move away from London looking increasingly likely.

Lukas Podolski has made 121 appearances for Germany, scoring 47 goals in the process

Voller does not believe Podolski has played his last game for Germany, though, and expects to see him revitalised in the new year.

'You must not write Poldi off,' he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper. 'He's not very old yet, at 29.

'Lukas is a very good player who always faces up to the challenge. Competition has got fiercer, but it says a lot that he is still always involved (for Germany).

National team boss Joachim Loew warned Podolski he must play at Arsenal if he wants to play for Germany

'Of course it's an advantage for a player's self-confidence when he is playing regularly, though.'

That is something Podolski will be seeking this winter when the transfer window opens with Loew's warning that he will lose his place in the national team enough to convince him to take action.

'I know how to deal with my situation and what Jogi has said,' Podolski said. 'It's just the case that I'm lacking a rhythm and this is down to the fact that I am not playing regularly for my club.'
