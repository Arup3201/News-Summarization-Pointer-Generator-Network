Ronald Koeman wants to take this competition ‘very seriously’, but for 45 minutes it looked as if no-one had told his players.

Then, after eight minutes of the second half, up popped Jack Cork. It was a decent time to score his first goal in more than 100 Southampton games; a decent time to remind Koeman of what he can offer, considering he has less than a year on his contract and Swansea are deliberating over a move.

Until then, Southampton had been dire against. Thereafter, they cantered, Graziano Pelle rounding off the win in stoppage time.

Koeman said: ‘There were two different halves. After the first 45, I was unhappy with the team. We didn’t control. They played fantastically, but we were very sloppy, not aggressive, not pressing. But much better in the second half.

‘The result is OK but I won’t forget the first 45. They (Millwall) gave everything and we didn’t in the first 45. That is not good.’

Credit to Millwall, they battled. Credit to Millwall, they were deceptive, considering all signs suggested this was a tie they could do without.

Ian Holloway made nine changes to the side that lost to Rotherham in the Championship on Saturday, and in the stands, there were 4,000 less than at the weekend.

Koeman, by contrasted, only drafted Matt Targett, Lloyd Isgrove and Shane Long into the team that drew with West Brom.

Koeman added: ‘We know we can’t win the Premier League so we will see what we can win. For others, maybe they can’t always go with the best team because there are so many games, but we don’t have European football.’

Isgrove, used on the left on Southampton’s attack, is one of the latest bright talents to come through the club’s academy and looks likely to get more senior chances this season. At 21, he has already been included in the Wales squad and made his league debut for Southampton against Liverpool on the opening day. 

Celebration: Cork wheels away in delight after netting his first goal for Southampton at the Den

Here, he offered a single glimpse of what the fuss is about by rapidly pursuing Justin Hoyte and closing a 10-yard gap before scrapping for possession. But that was the extent of it. Midway through the first half he went down injured and after 29 minutes he came off.

If that was worrying for Southampton, then so was the composition of the first half. They controlled large periods without creating chances, while Millwall twice came close.

First, Jack Powell delivered a corner from the right which Byron Webster glanced across goal.

Then, from David Forde’s punt, Magaye Gueye raced clear after 35 minutes. He sliced his shot horribly.

Graziano Pelle attempted a lob from 40 yards for Southampton in response, but it was easily saved. It summed up the visitors’ half. 

Ecstacy: Graziano Pelle was clearly delighted with his late goal, which was thoroughly deserved

Holloway said: 'I feel absolutely gutted. I really enjoyed the first half. When I saw their team sheet I thought what have I done? I wanted to give people a chance, but I knew it was a risk. I am delighted with the way they did it but I am devastated.'

The second started no better, Jermaine Easter going close after receiving a pass from Webster on the left. He cut inside and shot marginally wide from the edge of the area.

Dusan Tadic, on for Isgrove, came close moments later as Southampton finally tested Forde, his shot from 20 yards drawing a good save. Tadic was again involved as Southampton broke through in the 53rd minute.

His pass created a chance for Pelle, whose shot was tipped over. And then Tadic took the resultant corner, from which Cork headed the opener.

The 10-minute blitz was completed by Pelle hitting the post. Thereafter, Pelle went close again with a drive from the edge of the box and then had a low strike well saved by Forde, while Millwall had a shout for a penalty rejected.

Pelle deserved a goal and he got one, striking in stoppage time. Koeman looked pleased.
