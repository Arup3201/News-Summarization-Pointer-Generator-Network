Romanian migrant Victor Spirescu’s career at a car wash lasted just a day before he quit, it emerged last night.

Spirescu, 30, arrived in Britain on New Year’s Day to be greeted at Luton airport by Labour MP Keith Vaz – the chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Committee.

Spirescu was one of the first to arrive as  controls on migrants from Romania and Bulgaria lapsed.

He reassured Mr Vaz that he intended to find work as soon as possible and days later he had joined a team of fellow Eastern Europeans washing cars in the Bedfordshire town of Biggleswade.

But yesterday workers at the car wash in Foundry Lane told how he had vanished.

Mr Spirescu says he now plans to 
bring his teenage girlfriend to live with him in England even though he 
quit his job on the first day of work.

He
 says he is in a relationship with a 19-year-old called Catalina Curcean
 who has remained at the couple's bleak farmhouse home in the remote 
Transylvanian village of Pelisor.

Ms Curcean told Romanian media: 'Victor wants to stay there, to go to work. He found three jobs to choose. We talked last night… When he finds one, I plan to go as well’

A source at the car wash where he had worked said: 'He worked last Friday for the very first time and that was when he was photographed by the Daily Mail as the guys showed him the ropes and welcomed him to the country.'

'He did a full day and then came back to the house we all share in the town.

'The next day he said he needed to take the day off and was going to see his brother in London.

'On Saturday night he came back to the house and grabbed his bag and possessions and just left.

'We do not know where he is or what he is doing now and can't reach him on his Romanian mobile because he has turned it off to save on roaming charges.

'Basically he came, car washed for a day and quit.'

Staff at the car wash categorically denied that Victor had been sacked.

Speaking to Romanian media, Mr Spirescu confirmed that he had quit his fledgling car washing career saying: ‘I was not fired, I left. There has been a lot of lies told about me, and it all ended up too much.'

He added: 'My boss came to me and told 
me that he did not want to have problems after reading what was written 
in the newspapers, he did not like the coverage, and my colleagues had 
suffered as well, so I chose to leave. I had no other choice.’

Earlier this week it emerged that Victor had a previous conviction for assaulting his former girlfriend in Bucharest in 2009.

It was reported he had knocked the woman - named as 'Ana' - to the ground and punched her after she ended their relationship.

When questioned he refused to deny the incident and would only say: 'The past is the past - but we live in the present.'

Victor is now in a relationship with a 19-year-old Roma woman called Catalina who has remained at the couple's bleak farmhouse home in the remote Transylvanian village of Pelisor.
