Italy is selling off its presidential wild boars to be turned into salami and prosciutto.

They have lived on the President’s estate at Castelporziano, near Rome, since popes and Roman emperors hunted there centuries ago.

But faced with budget cuts, staff have found a novel way to balance the books – by selling off some of the boars each year to a tourist lodge that makes its own cured meats.

The sale is set to raise 40,000 euros (£30,000) a year.

The boars are to be sold to a hunting lodge in Abruzzo, specialising in wine tasting and processing of sausages, salami and proscitto, current affairs magazine Espresso reported.

Last month Italy, still crawling out of its worst recession since the World War II, began selling off its fleet of executive cars.

The boars are to be sold to a hunting lodge in Abruzzo, which specialises in producing salami and the sale will raise £30,000 per year

The sale of 1,500 ‘jags’ used by public officials is part of an ambitious programme of cuts announced by new prime minister Matteo Renzi.

The spectacular presidential estate, with five kilometres of beach, has for centuries played host to Rome’s elite.

It was the playground of the Roman emperors and then the popes. Hunting was banned on the five thousand hectares surrounding the Presidential castle in the 1970s and in 1999 it became a private nature reserve.
