Retailers are being warned to lock their bins after growing gangs of scavengers have been caught rooting through rubbish to grab discarded items they can sell or eat.

Groups have been secretly filmed rifling through refuse in Gloucester for the last two months, stealing furniture, clothes and food on a weekly basis.

Footage shows how they take it in turns to go through industrial dustbins for anything of worth and in the last few weeks have salvaged food scraps, computer monitors, and even a video player.

But they have been warned they could face up to seven years in prison for theft if they are caught in the act.

Caught in the act: This couple appear to raid items from bins in Gloucester and load it on to their mobility stroller

Help yourself! This man was filmed puling this basket of items from the dustbin, which also contained a computer monitor

Wide view: Two groups tackle separate bins in the centre of Gloucester, not knowing they were being watched from above

Richard Cook, 54, is among them, and said: 'There seems to be a lot in the charity shop bins. I come because I may find something special.

'The best things I have found include an Alice in Wonderland book, a dish and a clock radio. It was a lovely clock and the figures on it were in tact so I took that home with me.

'Gloucester is the best place to go looking. I have been to Chelsea, Soho and Cheltenham. Gloucester is the best.

'I am currently looking for a shelf and a pair of tights but they are not easy to find.'

Scavenger: Richard Cook says that he has taken from bins all over the country but maintains that the ones in Gloucester are the best

Sharing the spoils: This trio look at the items taken from this bin, hidden under cardboard boxes

Scavenging: This man brought his bike to rummage for rubbish and then appeared to pull out clothing

Spoils: People taking items have admitted to carrying off furniture, household goods and even food - nut they have been warned it is theft

Mr Cook is one of eight people who regularly scout out bins which belong to the Salvation Army and PDSA, as well as Edinburgh Woollen Mill and Sports Direct and a council-run arts venue.

Foodbank bosses said they not surprised people have taken to raiding bins in recent months and have seen a sharp rise in the number of people needing handouts.

Anneliese Sterry, from Gloucester Foodbank, said: 'This is not a surprise to us at all. It is not uncommon for this to happen.

'We have people coming to use who have not eaten for days. We have just one where a mother came in with her eight year old. She was complaining of pains because she hadn't eaten anything.'

A Gloucester City Council spokeswoman advised firms to lock their bins to thwart raiders.

She added: 'The city council would advise businesses who have any issues with people accessing their bins to speak with their trade waste carrier to have the bins locked.

'It is the responsibility of each of us to deal with our waste responsibly.'

Hard work: This man was caught on camera looking in this fallen dustbin and the one next to it, behind some charity shops

Return: The same man returned with an accomplice on a similar occasion to save items from landfill

Charity shops were quick to defend the way they handle their waste.

James Preece, area retail manager for YMCA, said: 'The bins in the photographs do not belong to our YMCA shop. We keep our bins securely locked up during the week and they are only put out on collection days.'

A spokeswoman for animal charity PDSA said they only placed their rubbish in bags on collection day and added: 'Any donations we receive that aren't saleable are ragged or recycled to raise funds for the charity.'

Theft from private property can lead to a maximum jail sentence of seven years but police in Gloucester said they do not recall making an arrests recently.
