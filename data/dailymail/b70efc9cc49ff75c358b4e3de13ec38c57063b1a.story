Fastfood giant McDonald's has apologised to a grandfather and his toddler grandson who were blasted by rap music peppered with explicit sex lyrics as they ate.

A song by x-rated American rapper Rucka Rucka Ali blared out across the Haverfordwest restaurant of the chain, in west Wales, last Friday.

Steve Davidson, of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, was having breakfast with 20-month-old grandson Charlie when the controversial song was broadcast over the outlet's sound system.

Breakfast rap: Fast food giant McDonald's has apologised to grandfather Steve Davidson for playing a foul rap song about prison rape when he took his grandson for a meal

The track is called 'Only 17',Â  and is from the controversial rapper's 2011 album called Probably Racist.

The song, too explicit to quote, talks in detail about anal rape, underage sex and prison violence.

Stunned Mr Davidson, a landlord who runs the Three Crowns pub in neighbouring Milford Haven, said the disgusting lyrics were 'bordering on pornography'.

McDonald's explained today that a late shift employee working after the outlet shut had left his private listening linked to its public sound system by mistake.

It apologised for the 'isolated lapse in our rigorous standards' and acknowledged that the content of the song lyrics were 'wholly inappropriate'.

'The bottom line is that it's bordering on pornography. It certainly shouldn't be playing in a restaurant where they sell Happy Meals to children,' Mr Davidson told the Western Telegraph, in Haverfordwest.

'The lyrics are disgusting, they are very explicit - not just a bit risque or a bit of swearing.

'It's not what you want while you're having your breakfast.

'You have to be over 18 to download it, for them to be playing it somewhere that attracts children is obviously a concern.'

A McDonald's spokesman said: 'We offer our sincere apologies to Mr Davidson for any offence caused by the music playing in our Haverfordwest store last Friday morning.

'The content and lyrics were wholly inappropriate and had no place in McDonald's.

'The previous evening while the restaurant dining area had been closed to members of the public, an employee had connected their personal music player to the restaurant sound system while working the overnight shift.

'This music device was inadvertently left connected to the system when the restaurant reopened the following morning.

'Management have spoken to the crew member involved and reminded all employees about the policies in place and the reasons for them.

'McDonald's is a family-friendly restaurant and we endeavour to provide a restaurant environment that is welcoming, comfortable and enjoyable for everybody.

'The vast majority of our restaurants, including Haverfordwest, have external music providers dedicated to creating playlists that have been thoroughly screened for appropriateness of language and content.

'We apologise to Mr Davidson for this isolated lapse in our rigorous standards.'
