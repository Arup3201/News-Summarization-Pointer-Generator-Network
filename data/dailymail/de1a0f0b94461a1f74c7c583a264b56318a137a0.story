James Milner faces a race to be fit for Manchester City's huge Champions League showdown against Barcelona on Tuesday.

The England midfielder has been one of the few City players to cover himself in glory during a difficult run that has seen Manuel Pellegrini's team fall seven points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea.

City face Newcastle on Saturday looking to win their first home league match since New Year's Day.

Manuel Pellegrini admitted that midfielder James Milner could miss Manchester City's next two games

The in-form England international has been superb for City in recent weeks but will be missing this weekend

But they will do so without Milner whose knee injury has ruled him out of the league game and makes him a serious doubt for the Champions League last 16 first leg home tie with the Spanish giants.

Pellegrini said: 'Tomorrow the only player that has a problem is James Milner, he has a problem in his knee and he is not available for tomorrow. All the other players in the squad are fit.

'We will see about Tuesday. It is not very, very serious but he couldn't work in the whole week so we will see how he improves in the next days but he has a kick in his ligament in his knee.

'We are just thinking about the game against Newcastle. It is important to try to have three more points in the Premier League. When we finish Newcastle we are going to start thinking about Champions League and Barcelona.'

Milner heads in City's winning goal in the impressive 4-1 win against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium

The Englishman rescued a point for City at home against Hull with this fine free-kick on February 7

Milner was awarded the Etihad Player of the Month award for his performances throughout January

Pellegrini will welcome back Yaya Toure from his triumphant Africa Cup of Nations campaign with Ivory Coast and must decide what role his countryman - and new City signing - Wilfried Bony will play against Newcastle.

Pellegrini said: 'I think that Bony will be an important player for us. He will be in the squad list we will see if he will be in the starting 11 or after that have some minutes but he works with our team the whole week without any problems.

'He has settled in the same way I supposed he was going to do it because he is a player that plays here in England, he knows the Premier League, he knows our team so I think it will be easy for him to settle in in a good way.'

Wilfried Bony and Yaya Toure offer old and new options respectively for Pellegrini on their return from Africa

Toure helped lead Ivory Coast to the Africa Cup of Nations title with Bony also playing a big role for Ivory Coast
