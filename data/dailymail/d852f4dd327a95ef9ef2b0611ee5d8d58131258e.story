A holidaymaker used his  camera to record the frightening moment a mother elephant and her  calf angrily chased a Jeep full of safari tourists in Africa.

The nature lovers were traveling through Zambia's Lower Zambezi National Park when the heart-stopping encounter occurred.

Anthon van Dijk, from the Netherlands, pulled out his camera as the tourists' vehicle narrowly escaped being rammed and flipped by the protective mum.

According to Anthon, the mother made several mock charges before finally giving chase - with her calf in tow.

His footage shows the safari driver speeding away it in a bid to outrun the elephant.

The terrified passengers can be heard yelling 'Please, please, please' as the elephant refuses to give up the chase.

Anthon, who was on a safari with his son Levi, said: 'In these national parks, what is seen quite often is that the Jeeps for these trips drive with high speed towards a predator sighting.

'This makes the elephants who are passed close by with high speed not so happy.

'We noticed this Jeep-phobia with a lot of elephants in the park.'

A tourist said the calf outran its mother at one point before the holidaymakers managed to escape 

He added: 'In the video you see a female with her young. We'd seen several mock charges, but this was a full charge by mother and child.

'The little one was trumpeting as well and even outrunning the mother in the chase, as you can hear in the video. It was an exciting experience, to say the least.

'Luckily we got away.'
