A mother and her infant son were killed this weekend in a late-night off-roading excursion gone wrong. 

Hallie Lewis, 22, and boyfriend Taylor Brown, 21, of Orlando strapped their 1-year-old son Brason into a child seat to go along for the off-roading drive near Walt Disney World Saturday night.

Around 10:30pm, the couple's Jeep got stuck in a muddy area and Brown exited the vehicle to try and pull it out of the muck with the help of a friend in a different truck.

While Brown was trying to rescue the stranded Jeep, Lewis and her baby boy became unresponsive inside the vehicle, according to a press release by the Florida Highway Patrol. 

Mother and son were transported to separate hospitals. Lewis was pronounced dead at Dr Phillips Hospital, while baby Brason battled for his life at Arnold Palmer Children's Hospital in critical condition. The baby was later pronounced dead Sunday evening. 

Authorities continue to investigate the deadly incident, but believe the mud may have clogged the Jeep's exhaust pipe, exposing Lewis and her son to carbon monoxide poisoning.
