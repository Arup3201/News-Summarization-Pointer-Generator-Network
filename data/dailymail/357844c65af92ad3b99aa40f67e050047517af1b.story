Six people have been killed, including a three-year-old girl, and dozens injured after 25 tornadoes tore across the Southeast.

In North Carolina, the toddler was found buried under a pile of shattered furniture along with her 50-year-old grandmother. Their small house in a rural area of Lexington had been ripped clean from its foundations.

The storms left at trail of
debris that stretched for at least seven miles, with a dozen 
people taken to hospital.

Firefighters and volunteers in Lexington searched for the child, whose name wasn't immediately released, for more than two hours.

A neighbour Maegan Chriscoe said: 'She was just beautiful, big blue eyes and so sweet.'

Some 25 tornadoes were reported in Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and South Carolina. Severe weather also hit Georgia, where one person died near Atlanta when a tree fell on his car.

In South Carolina, three people were killed and five injured when a tornado swept through a rural community near Rock Hill.

One resident Henry Taylor said he was
home watching television with his wife when he saw a tornado warning 
flash on the screen. A minute later, he saw a funnel cloud out his 
window.

Mr Taylor, 50, said: 'It looked like 
the 'Wizard of Oz. It was surreal, and for a moment, a split second, you
say to yourself ''This ain't real,'' then reality sets in, and you know
it is.'

With the latest deaths, the number of 
tornado fatalities for 2011 is 553, making it the deadliest year for tornadoes in the U.S. since 1925. 

In Mississippi, emergency director Don McKinnon said some residents were trapped in their homes after trees fell on them.

Mr McKinnon said: 'There were no fatalities, so it's a good day.'

Mobile homes were tossed

The National Weather Service confirmed a
tornado with winds between 85 and 90 miles an hour ripped through 
Demopolis, Alabama yesterday.

Homes were damaged in Alabama in the worst weather the state has seen since 250 people were killed in tornadoes in April. An elderly woman was hospitalised after a tree smashed through the roof of her home. 

The severe weather was a harsh 
reminder for the state as many communities are still recovering from the 
tornadoes earlier in the year.

Perryman, who works for the school system in Tuscaloosa County.
