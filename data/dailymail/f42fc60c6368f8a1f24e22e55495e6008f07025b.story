Arsenal have confirmed that a fan was arrested after reportedly throwing red wine towards Manchester United's bench after the visitors' opening goal at the Emirates Stadium on Saturday.

United moved back into the top four following their 2-1 win in north London after an Antonio Valencia shot deflected in off Kieran Gibbs and a Wayne Rooney strike, before Olivier Giroud got one back late on.

Arsenal have promised stiff action against the fan if he is found guilty.
