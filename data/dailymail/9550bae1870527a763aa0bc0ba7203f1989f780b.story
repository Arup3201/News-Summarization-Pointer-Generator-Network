A married high school teacher has announced that he no longer wants to be identified as male and is beginning the transition to become female.

Robert Konrad, a social studies teacher at Mitchell High School in Pasco County, Florida, plans to present himself as female by August 2015, principal Jim Michaels said in an email to parents.

'As you can imagine, this is a very private decision, but Mr. Konrad has indicated that he will respond to appropriate questions you may have about the transition process,' he said, the Tampa Bay Times reported.

Konrad has worked at the school since 2010. His wife, Jericho Konrad, also works at the school and teaches reading, school records show. They have a two-year-old daughter together.

Michael Nguyen, a student of Konrad's wife, said she had been supportive of her husband's decision.

'She said about how she supports him and how they are doing,' Nguyen told WFLA.

Pasco County School District spokeswoman Linda Cobbe told the Times that the decision to release information to parents, staff and students was Konrad's and has the full support of the district.

He did not want to hear rumors when he started changing his appearance, staff said. 

'We don't think the person's gender or the person changing their gender affects their ability to teach,' she told the Pasco Tribune. 

As well as sending the email and making automated voice calls to parents, Michaels made the announcement during a staff meeting and spoke to students in Konrad's classroom.

'From what I have heard, the students are very supportive,' said Betsy Kuhn, the school district's director of employee relations. 

The announcement was met with surprise but support from former and current students.

'It's great for him to feel comfortable enough to come out,' Kerry Archbold, a former student, told the Tampa Bay Times. 'Now he's just Mrs. Konrad instead of Mr. Konrad.'

Taylor Hanlon, a current student, added to WFLA: 'I think there are a few against it but there are a lot of it that are for  it and happy for him.'

Others expressed their support for the teacher on social media, with one football player writing on Twitter that if students didn't like the decision it was 'too bad' - and they could go to another school.

School district staff worked with Konrad, who told the principal of his decision at the start of the school year, through every step of the process, Kuhn said. 

They could not find any precedent where a school district had handled a similar situation so instead they consulted with private companies that had guides on how to deal with gender transition.

'There was nothing on point to students,' she said. 'We tried to tailor a plan to what would work for education and in Pasco.'

Some parents have expressed concern, fearing that there will be disruptions in the classroom because students could be distracted by the teacher and unable to concentrate on the lessons.

'Teachers are supposed to be role models,' said Wendy Howard, a school choice activist who does not have kids at the school. 'They're supposed to leave their personal lives out of the classroom.' 

Konrad, who identifies as Cosette on social media, declined to be interviewed but expressed thanks on Facebook, saying: 'Thank you to everyone for kind words.' 

Speaking to WFLA, he said he would possibly speak out in the future if it would be beneficial to students who find themselves in a similar situation.
