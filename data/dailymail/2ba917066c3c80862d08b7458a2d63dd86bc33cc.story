The English chief executive of a Fifa partner company who is suspected of involvement with a ticket-scalping ring was released from prison today.

Ray Whelan, of the MATCH group of companies, was arrested on Monday at the Copacabana Palace in Rio de Janeiro, the hotel used by FIFA officials during the World Cup.

Police have described Whelan as the 'facilitator' who allowed a large ring of scalpers to have access to tickets, which they re-sold at vastly inflated prices.

Whelan's attorney, Fernando Fernandes, told reporters his arrest was 'illegal and absurd.'

Whelan will not be allowed to leave Brazil.

He was detained for questioning after the earlier arrests of 11 people, including Algerian national Lamine Fofana.

MATCH said in a statement it has complete confidence in Whelan's innocence and that he would return to work.

'Ray
 Whelan has been released from police custody and will assist the police
 with further enquiries,' it said. 'MATCH have complete faith that the 
facts will establish that he has not violated any laws.'

The
 arrest came as part of Operation Jules Rimet, Brazil police's 
investigation into ticket touting which has seen detectives tap phones, 
make a total of 12 arrests and seize a number of tickets.

Police are investigating the illegal resale of World Cup tickets on the black market and arrested 11 people and seized 131 game tickets last week - at least 70 of them for corporate hospitality.

Police said then that an Algerian man arrested as the suspected leader of the scalping ring had connections to FIFA or Match and the original source of the tickets to be sold illegally at hugely inflated prices was 'someone higher up.'

Match Hospitality is the main provider of hospitality packages for the World Cup and paid $240million for the exclusive rights to sell corporate hospitality at the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.

Blatter's nephew, Philippe Blatter, is the president of a company which is a shareholder in Match Hospitality.

Re-selling World Cup tickets for profit is illegal in Brazil and against FIFA rules.

Police said they had information from 50,000 phone calls they tapped during their scalping investigation.

Of the more than 3 million purchasable tickets for the tournament, 445,500 were allocated to Match Hospitality, according to FIFA.

Any unsold or unused corporate hospitality tickets should be returned to FIFA to be made available to the public.

Police estimated last week that the scalping ring was making 1 million Brazilian reals ($455,000) per game by re-selling tickets on the black market.

They were hoping to get $16,000 per ticket for the July 13 final in Rio, they said.

The
 Algerian suspected to be the ringleader of the scalpers, Mohamadou 
Lamine Fofana, runs a company that is one of Match Hospitality's 
customers.

Match said 
Monday that Fofana's Atlanta Sportif Management and three other 
companies, two of them official Match Hospitality agents, had their 
remaining World Cup ticket allocations blocked or canceled after some of
 their tickets ended up in the hands of scalpers.

Police said that Fofana was only the middle man and appeared to have access to restricted areas at the Copacabana Palace Hotel.

Earlier,
 MATCH Hospitality announced it had blocked sales to four companies 
after tickets were seized from touts by Brazilian police.

The
 four companies are Atlanta Sportif, whose chief executive was one of 
those arrested in Rio de Janeiro, Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set 
Sports and Pamodzi.

Jet Set is based in New Jersey, Reliance is one of India's biggest companies, and Padmodzi is based in Nigeria.

A statement from MATCH read: 'Following... the arrest of Lamine Fofana, CEO of Atlanta Sportif, engaging in illegal resales, MATCH Hospitality has cancelled all hospitality packages purchased by Atlanta Sportif for the remaining matches of the 2014 FIFA World Cup.

'Pending further investigations, MATCH Hospitality will block the packages of Reliance Industries Ltd, Jet Set Sports and Pamodzi.

'The customers and agents mentioned above are to co-operate with MATCH Hospitality by helping the authorities with their enquiries regarding the hospitality packages with their names on them found in Mr Fofana's possession, failing which, MATCH Hospitality will cancel their tickets for the semi-final and the final too.'
