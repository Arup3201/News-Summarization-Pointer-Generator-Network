Swedish furniture giant Ikea will produce 10,000 flat-pack shelters for the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) as temporary homes for refugees across the world.

The 'Better Shelter' units are to be rolled out on a mass scale following a successful trial in Ethiopia and the borders of Syria, in 2013.

It is hoped the flat-pack homes, which can built in four hours without the need for tools, will make desperate conditions more bearable for displaced families.

The first mass delivery will head to camps across Iraq where 2.5 million people have been displaced by conflict.  

In typical Ikea fashion, the walls, roof, floors, door and windows all come flat packed in cardboard boxes, making them easy to transport. 

Dwellers will be pleased the 17.5sqm shelters are twice as large as the current crop of refugee tents used by the UN and can accommodate five or six people.

Shaun Scales, chief of shelter and settlement at the UN's refugee agency UNHCR, said they would improve the lives of tens of thousands of people.

'The refugee housing unit is an exciting new development in humanitarian shelter and represents a much needed addition to the palette of sheltering options mobilized to assist those in need,' he said.

'Its deployment will ensure dramatic improvement to the lives of many people affected by crises.'

Refugee camps are typically overcrowded with temperatures in tents fluctuating between sweltering hot in the day time and freezing at night.

The walls and roof are made from the lightweight polymer, Rhulite, laminated with thermal insulation, which clips straight onto the shelter's steel pole frame. They are strong enough to withstand the harsh climates seen in refugee camps.

The material was specially developed to allow daylight to penetrate the shelter during the day but also to trap light sources emitting from inside the tent. It also stops people from being able to see shadows inside the tent, addressing privacy issues. It should assist inhabitants to read, learn and engage at night time under artificial light.

A  lightweight insulated technical metallic textile is made with interlaced aluminium and polyolefin strips, designed to reflect heat from the sun during the day and stop the heat escaping from inside the tent at night. There is a solar panel on top, laminated on a thin plastic film, designed to generate electricity for a light and USB port inside the unit.

But it is hoped the specially-designed shelters will bring an end to the grim conditions, with flexible solar panels on the roofs for power, and specially-made walls that can deflect heat during the day and retain it at night.

At 1.75 metres high, they are tall enough for people to stand, and even have lockable doors, ventilation, solar panels, mosquito nets and lights.

Mr Scales said: 'The units comprise the best elements of a tent in that it's pre-packed, of minimal weight and produced to core standards, but it also has a rigid, self-supporting frame and it provides more physical security and dignity for its occupants'.

The shelters originally cost about £5,000, three times more than a standard UNHCR tent, but are designed to last for at least three years in harsh climates, compared to a tent's average lifespan of six months. The firm hopes they could be made for around £655 each once in mass production.

Ikea's philanthropist foundation helped to fund the original project while a Sweden-based group called the Refugee Housing Unit has been working with the UN agency on the design.

Jonathan Spampinato, head of strategic planning and Communications, at the IKEA Foundation said they were proud to help the relief effort.

He said: 'Putting refugee families and their needs at the heart of this project is a great example of how democratic design can be used for humanitarian value. 

'We are incredibly proud that the Better Shelter is now available, so refugee families and children can have a safer place to call home.'

Elsewhere, the Norwegian Refugee Council is piloting a similar type of structure in a refugee camp in Jordan where there are also a number of Syrian families living in container homes provided by Gulf donors.
