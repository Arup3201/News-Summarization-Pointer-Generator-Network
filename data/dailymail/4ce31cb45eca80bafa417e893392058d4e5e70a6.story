The BBC was at the centre of a new controversy over Jimmy Savile last night after it emerged that a planned Panorama investigation on the scandal may be delayed.

Staff on the BBC1 current affairs show confirmed yesterday that they had previously been told that the ‘quick-turnaround’ programme would be going out on Monday.

Contributors were also informed that the investigation was going to air the night before BBC director-general George Entwistle’s appearance in front of the culture, media and sport select committee on Tuesday.

New controversy: The airing of a Panorama investigation into the allegations surrounding Sir Jimmy Savile, pictured at Stoke Mandeville Hospital in 2003, may be delayed

Timely: Any delay would mean the show is aired after BBC director-general George Entwistle appears before MPs over the Savile allegations on Tuesday

But now it has emerged that the BBC could move the show to later in the week, blaming the fact that it might not be ready for Monday.

This would mean any damaging revelations would air after the BBC chief had appeared in front of MPs.

Tom Giles, editor of Panorama, said yesterday that his team were ‘working very hard’ to get the show on air as soon as they could.

But one MP said it would be ‘extraordinary’ if it did not go out on Monday, while another said there would ‘need to be a very good reason why not’.

Former Newsnight political editor Michael Crick, now at Channel 4 News, described the fact that Panorama was set to go out the night before Mr Entwistle’s appearance as a ‘huge problem’ for him.

The programme is in part expected to probe what role executives including Mr Entwistle and director of news Helen Boaden had in the decision to drop a Newsnight investigation into Savile’s activities.

Critics have suggested that the programme was dropped to protect the corporation’s reputation, but the BBC has repeatedly denied that any pressure was put on Newsnight editor Peter Rippon to pull the investigation.

The suggestion that the Panorama programme could be moved back has raised new questions about the BBC’s handling of the issue.

Conservative MP John Whittingdale, who chairs the committee which will be interviewing Mr Entwistle, said: ‘Given that one of the major issues is the suggestion that the BBC has been trying to suppress an investigation into this issue, if it were not transmitted on Monday there would need to be a very good reason.’

Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders, who also sits on the  committee, said of the potential Panorama delay: ‘I find that extraordinary and would expect Entwistle to give a full explanation when he comes before the committee.’

Yesterday the BBC was asked by women’s groups to investigate whether ‘institutional sexism’  was partly to blame for the alleged abuse by Savile.

Apology: The director-general of the BBC George Entwistle has previously issued a 'profound and heartfelt apology' to Jimmy Savile's victims

Investigation: Scotland Yard is now investigating the Jimmy Savile abuse case involving dozens of potential victims
