Fined: Akthar Khan was handed a £4,000 fine and ordered to pay £21,869 in costs after one of his workers lost his fingers while working in his Birmingham supermarket

A food shop owner who was back using a food mincer less than an hour after it had sliced off the fingers of a part-time employee has been ordered to pay out more than £25,000.

Akthar Khan - who used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean the machine - was also handed an eight month suspended sentence after earlier admitting a single breach of health and safety regulations.

Judge James Burbidge QC described Khan's management as 'woeful', and said: 'It is beyond belief the machine was still being used even after a man lost his fingers.' 

Birmingham Magistrates Court had previously heard Aston's Ash Food Fare's meat slicer had lost its safety guard a month before Mr Iqbal lost his fingers in October 2012.

Staff had been using a plunger to insert meat since the breakage, the city's magistrates' court heard. 

Fellow workers heard Mr Iqbal screaming  as he placed his right hand inside the machine, which continued to operate as an ambulance crew rushed to the shop.

A paramedic only recovered three of Mr Iqbal's fingers after the machine was dismantled.

But an hour later a police officer arrived to find the machine was back in use and one of the employees said washing liquid had been used to clean it.

Khan, 57, then admitted he had used Fairy Liquid.

Barry Berlin, prosecuting, said: 'Mr Abdul (the manager) said he used Fairy Liquid and hot water to clean it, which was fairly inadequate.

'He then passed vegetables through it before using it. There was no safe system of work here at all.

'We have looked and we can't find any steps he (Khan) took to protect his staff from the unguarded mincer.' 

Simon Morgan, defending, maintained Khan, of Witton, Birmingham, knew nothing of the missing hand guard - but said he fully accepted responsibility and 'bitterly regrets the injury caused'.

'He is 57 years of age, has no previous convictions, he is very highly regarded,' Mr Morgan said.

'He has worked extremely hard all his life.'

Mr Morgan said Khan had also carried out good work for the benefit of the community spanning two decades.

Suspended: Khan, 57, was a 'woeful' manager, according to Judge James Burbidge QC

Judge Burbidge said: 'You should have been more proactive and should be well attuned, given your position in the community, to follow basic safety procedures.

'If you had been, Mr Iqbal would not have suffered that traumatic amputation.'

Khan was ordered to pay a £4,000 fine and £21,869 in costs.
