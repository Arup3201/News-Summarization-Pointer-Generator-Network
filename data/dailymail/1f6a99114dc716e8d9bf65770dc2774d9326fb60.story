A 13-year-old boy shot dead his six-year-old brother and wounded his older brother in an argument about food while their mother was at work. 

The shooting happened shortly after 6pm in Hudson, in the westernmost end of Pasco County, Florida, in the family's mobile home. 

The three brothers were home alone eating dinner when the argument broke out, said Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco. 

The shooting happened just after 6pm in the Sugar Lane Mobile Home Park on Bachmann Avenue, Hudson

They lived in the home with their mother and an 18-year-old brother. The mother was at work and the oldest brother was not at home. 

The shooter shot dead his younger brother and wounded his 16-year-old brother, who then called police for help. 

Sheriff Nocco said: 'This is a horrific scene. Sadly we talk about too many tragic situations that happen in Pasco County and this is a nightmare when you hear about the ages of these boys, a six-year-old that was probably playing in his room, an argument over food and he lost his life.

'This is tough on us as law enforcement, this is tough on a community. And for the friends of these two boys, this is going to be tough tomorrow for them at school.' 

The shooting took place at this mobile home park in Hudson, in Pasco County about an hour north of Tampa

An argument over food led to a 13-year-old boy to shoot two of his brothers, killing his younger brother

The County Sheriff Chris Nocco described the shootings as a 'nightmare' and 'tough on the community' 

He did not give the names of the shooter or victims and said it was not clear who owned the gun. 

The 16-year-old's wounds were not believed to be life-threatening and he is being treated at an area hospital.

Neighbor Stephanie Ridgeway said: 'I don't understand it really. It doesn't make any sense.'

Linda Cobbe, spokeswoman for the Pasco County School District, said: 'We're devastated that this would happen to such young children, and we are prepared to provide whatever services are needed at their schools.'

The shootings happened about two miles away from the location of another family slaying. 

In August, three members of a family and a fourth man were discovered dead. The ex-boyfriend of one of the victims is awaiting trial in connection to those deaths.
