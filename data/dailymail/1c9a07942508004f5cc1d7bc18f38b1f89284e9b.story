The beauty queen and TV star gunned down with her British ex-husband in front of their daughter spoke of their enduring friendship in a poignant interview before she died.

Miss Venezuela 2004, Monica Spear Mootz, 29, was shot to death alongside Thomas Berry, 39, from London, by thieves after their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway at about 10pm on Monday.

Police made five arrests in connection with the case earlier today, including two who were said to be under 18.

Happy: Despite separating Thomas Berry and Monica Spear holidayed together for their daughter's sake

Horrific: Robbers shot through the car windscreen when the terrified family locked themselves in

Nightmare: A friend of Berry said he had spoken to him on Sunday and was told they were having a great time

In an interview in Venezuelan magazine Panorama, she said they had remained close despite the divorce and agreed to they would still spend time together with their five-year-old daughter Maya.

She said: 'It was a spectacularly civilised divorce. My friends ask me if I have suffered and are amazed because I say no.

'I married a very civilised person and when we decided to separate we decided that we would continue seeing each other with our child.

'I want him to have a good life and and he wants the same for me. I assure you there are no problems.'

Armed men came up the car as the couple waited 
for a repair truck, and the terrified couple locked themselves in their 
Toyota Corolla. But the robbers opened fire through the windows.

The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their daughter, who had been shot in the leg.

The five-year-old was taken to hospital where family and friends are helping to care for her.

Her ex-husband, an 
independent travel consultant, lived in the capital
 Caracas, reports El Universal.

He moved to Florida for a short time after he was shot 15 years ago in a robbery that killed his friend.

'He had already been shot once by robbers trying to steal his car,' close friend Luis Dominguez told The Telegraph.

'His
 friend died in the incident and although doctors saved his life, they 
couldn't extract the bullet and he still had it in his stomach.'

['Mr Berry] moved to the States to get
 away from things here for a while but missed Venezuela and came back,' 
Mr Dominguez added.

He said the family had spent New Year's in the mountains of the western state of Merida then traveled to the plains.

Mr Dominguez said they were people 'who really loved the country' and had a good relationship despite the divorce.

According to Telemundo, the car was already on the back of a tow truck at the time of the attack.

Two tow truck drivers who had arrived to help the couple are said to be under 'intense interrogation' by police.

All
 the tires on the couple's car had been punctured after it hit 'a sharp 
object that had been placed on the highway', director of investigative 
police, Jose Gregorio Sierralta, said.

Police believe the couple may have been targeted by bandits who put obstacles in the road to force victims to stop.

The ploy is commonly used on the country's highways after dark.

Venezuela is one the most violent places in Latin America and armed robberies, carjackings and kidnappings are rife.

The annual murder rate in Caracas alone is an average of 80 murders per 100,000 people, the third highest in the world.

Most
 murders occur in the slums where police presence is minimal. Eastern 
Caracas is home to South Americaâ€™s largest slum, named Petare with more 
than two million residents, where the police to public ratio is 1 
officer to every 3,000 people.

There
 were an estimated 24,000 murders in 2013, one of the worldâ€™s highest 
homicide rates. It has tripled in the previous decade.

Gun ownership is also high, with an estimated 15 million unlicensed weapons in circulation.

At
 least six shots are believed to have been fired, hitting Mr Berry in 
the chest, his ex-wife in several places and their daughter in the leg.

The
 attack appeared to follow a pattern of recent robberies, where cars are
 disabled by obstacles left in roads, or drain covers removed.

A photo 
believed to be the couple's car was pictured behind police tape by 
Gilbert Angustia on Twitter.

Ms
 Spear was a famous TV actress following her pageant victory and 
appeared in a number of telenovelas [South American soap operas], with 
her roll in 'Forbidden Passions' the most notable.

The University of Central Florida graduate had American citizenship and her parents live in Orlando, Florida.

Pictures of the model enjoying the vacation with her young daughter were posted on Ms Spear's Instagram account in the days leading up to her death.

In a short video posted on the day she was shot dead, the actress blows a kiss to the camera during a horse riding trip.

His parents are at the hospital with the couple's daughter. It is not known if his sister, Katie, who lives in Scotland, will fly out to be with the family.

In the Panorama interview, the actress spoke of her ideal man.

She said: 'I want a man who respects me, who lets me be me, who shares my feelings.

'I need someone to make me feel positive, regardless of whether the relationship lasts a lifetime or not.

'It is also imperative to have a sense of humor, I love a man who makes me laugh.

'I'm super romantic and I'd like him to sing to me, to cuddle me and love me in all ways.

'That's what I live for - a fine, beautiful love.'

Ms Spear's parents were flown from Florida to Venezuela by private jet, provided by Venezuela's president, so they could be with their granddaughter.

'It is the deepest pain, the deepest pain. It is unbelievable,' her father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'She was very charismatic, a very good daughter, a very good mother, and she loved Venezuela.'

He recalled how his daughter had come to him for advice when she wanted to change from her chemical engineering course to study acting instead.

'I told her she had to decide what she wanted to do to be happy for the rest of her life,' he said. 'When my children were young, I wouldn't let them watch telenovelas, and then she began acting in soap operas, and I began watching all of hers.'

Mr Dominguez, who ran an adventure tour company with the actress's ex-husband, told NBC he last spoke to Mr Berry on Sunday. 'They were having the greatest time. He said, I'll see you soon,' Mr Dominguez said.

A friend of the family, Carlos Drakkar, 38, a Colombian graphic designer who lives in Caracas, said: 'This is a very difficult moment for all of us to deal with. We are doing all we can to help out friends in this difficult moment. These things happen all too often in this country. Something has to change.'

Ms Spear's family had asked her to move to the U.S. with them after she was robbed six times, but the model refused.

Her brother, Ricardo Spear Mootz, said: 'She loved her country too much. It was her home.'

Family friend Marytza Sanz said Miss Spear loved Venezuela and even though she could have remained in the U.S. she chose to return so her daughter could spend time there.

The network Miss Spear worked for released a statement describing her as a 'great actress' who had 'extraordinary drive and determination'.

Venezuela's public prosecutor has appointed two separate investigators to the case, while the CICPC, Venezuela's SWAT police force unit, has been deployed to nearby slums for answers.

Commissioner Daniel Alvarez , head of the CICPC's homicide division, promised 'fast results in this awful case'.

The Foreign Office says it is aware of the reports and are looking into it with the assistance of its offices in Venezuela.

A
 spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of a British 
national on 6 January in Venezuela. We stand ready to provide consular 
assistance to the family.'

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro  vowed to respond to the violence gripping his country with 'an iron fist, the BBC reported.

'There
 will be no tolerance to those who carry out acts like that, killing 
decent men and women, who have a right to live,' he said.
