Hoard: Dr Peter Tlusty allegedly kept a huge collection of manipulated pornographic images in his consulting room at a top London surgery

A cosmetic surgeon hoarded a massive collection of explicit pornography in his consultation room – including pictures he had created with faces of patients and nurses pasted on to hardcore images, a tribunal was told.

Dr Peter Tlusty, 57, worked in an exclusive practice in Belgravia in central London, and was a specialist in aesthetic procedures such as administering Botox and collagen fillers to private patients.

But when his secretive behaviour aroused suspicions, the hearing heard colleagues searched his office and the haul of pornography was discovered, including 16 filing cabinets filled with obscene magazines and folders with hundreds of manipulated images of patients and surgery staff in  X-rated poses.

He had also compiled diaries with league tables rating patients and staff on their looks.

Dr Tlusty appeared before the General Medical Council (GMC) yesterday accused of misconduct.

The hearing was told that Dr Tlusty, who worked at the exclusive Belgravia Surgery near Buckingham Palace, had manipulated one image to make it appear as if the surgery’s receptionist, a nurse and a male patient were having sex. Lewd comments had also been scrawled on them.

The doctor, who lives in a £1.5million house near Wandsworth Common in South-West London with his wife and three daughters, had been warned in 2006 about his use of pornography after visiting a website which infected the surgery’s computer system with a virus.

One of the partners at the practice, Dr David Parry, emailed colleagues warning them about the virus and said he intended to ask Westminster Primary Care Trust’s IT department to trace its source.

Giving evidence at the hearing, Dr 
Parry said: ‘Dr Tlusty took me to one side and said he did not want me 
to do this as he felt it was probably him, because he had a habit of 
viewing what he termed soft pornography sites.

‘I suggested that he should do that in his own time and using his own equipment.’ 

Exclusive: Dr Tlusty worked at the this clinic in London. He is reported to have compiled lists of good looking patients and staff who went there

Dr
 Parry told the hearing he believed Dr Tlusty had stopped watching 
pornography at work, but in 2008, after he continued to act 
suspiciously, Dr Parry and practice manager Margaret Burton decided to 
search the surgeon’s locked consultation room.

Dr Parry said they found ‘mounds upon mounds upon mounds of pornography. There was very little clinical material in the room.’

Discovering a drawer full of hundreds of manipulated images of staff and patients, Dr Parry added: ‘That shocked me. The images were pornographic. They were extremely well done but obviously manipulated.

‘The drawer was packed with folders which seemed to contain cut-outs and further images.’

Police officers were called in who then uncovered the full extent of the haul, which included 16 filing cabinets full of pornographic material with 39 files containing X-rated images, 132 adult magazines, a CD of explicit photos and various magazine clippings.

When officers opened Dr Tlusty’s desk drawer, they discovered diamorphine – also known as heroin – and other powerful sedatives. Dr Parry told the hearing it was surgery policy not to store drugs on site.

A few days later a locum doctor discovered further pornographic photographs and Dr Tlusty’s diaries. It was then found he had written league tables of patients and staff marking their looks out of ten.

Paul Ozin, for the GMC, said four diaries were found. ‘They contained a number of narratives, a number of lists in the form that could be described as league tables. He graded a number of individuals with scores out of ten.’ 

Dr Tlusty, who denies the misconduct charges, could be struck off if they are proved.

The hearing continues.
