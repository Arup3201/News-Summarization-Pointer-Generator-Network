The NSW government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy and may even consider growing its own supply. 

The government will work with a panel to create a a Centre for Cannabinoid Research, and with their help will decide whether medical cannabis can be sourced from overseas. 

If the cannabis cannot be imported, the Premier has confirmed that the government are prepared to spearhead a homegrown medical cannabis industry in Australia.

The NSW government has announced that it will provide medical cannabis to children suffering from extreme forms of epilepsy

Premier Mike Baird said almost $9 million will be invested in clinical trials to see how the drug could possibly provide relief to sufferers of epilepsy and from the effects of chemotherapy. 

The breakthrough comes just days after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews spoke about his plans to legalise the drug.

Mr Baird said the government aims to establish a Medical Cannabis Expert Panel which will include NSW Chief Medical Officer, Dr Kerry Chant, and employees from the University of Sydney.  

Speaking to The Telegraph, Mr Baird said something needs to be done about the use of medical cannabis in Australia, if there is proof it helps sufferers.

'Once we have the clinical evidence that medical cannabis can reduce suffering then the government will consider a range of supply measures, including importation. But if that does not prove successful then the government will assume responsibility for supply itself,' Mr Baird said.

However, Dr John Lawson from Sydney Children's Hospital in Randwick, told the paper that only a small number of children will benefit from this research, as some might not respond well to the drug. 

'The entry criteria will be those who have failed standard treatments who continue to seize on a daily basis and mostly focused on the younger children,' he said. 

In August, an Australian mother, who was treating her two-year-old daughter with medicinal cannabis, was left distressed after police raided her supplier who was dobbed in to authorities by ACT.

Doctors told Cherie last year that her daughter Abbey would live only a few months as a result of CDKL5, a rare genetic condition that results in uncontrolled and violent seizures sometimes lasting up to 45 minutes, as well as a range of physical and mental disabilities.

After months of failed treatment, and on the verge of admitting Abbey to a palliative care unit, Cherie bought some liquid medical marijuana from a supplier in Canberra and snuck it into the hospital and put it into Abbey's feeding tube.

The results on Abbey were astonishing,

'The seizures were less intense, they weren't as long and she wasn't having as many of them,' Cherie told Daily Mail Australia

'The seizures were less intense, they weren't as long and she wasn't having as many of them,' Cherie told Daily Mail Australia.

'I started her on it without the knowledge of the staff at the hospital… They were quite surprised because they didn't know what was going on. The paediatrician commented on how well she was looking.'

But Cherie says it was likely Abbey would die in the next few months, after her supply of medicinal cannabis dried up.

Cherie has enough medicinal cannabis to last Abbey for six weeks and no prospect of getting more since her cannabis supplier was raided in February.

'Once [the cannabis] is gone the seizures will return, there's no if and buts about it, there's a big risk of death,' she said.
