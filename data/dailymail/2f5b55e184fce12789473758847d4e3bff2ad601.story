Marisa Cauchi has spoken of her anger at being omitted from former England manager Sven Goran Erriksson's memoir

A former lover of Sven Goran Eriksson says says their four-year relationship has been cruelly ignored in the ex-England football manager's memoirs.

Marisa Cauchi, 41, a skip hire company director who lives in Bury, says their relationship began in 2007 after they met in a restaurant in Swinton, Greater Manchester but ended in 2011 because he was seeing numerous other women.

But she says 'Sven: My Story' makes no mention of their time together and feels betrayed by the former Manchester City manager, 65.

She said: 'He told me he loved me and promised we'd come out as a couple. In reality he was keeping me a secret so he could romance other women.'

Ms Cauchi, who was born in Salford and has two children from previous relationships, claims the revelations in the book do not fully reflect the extent of the Swede's womanising ways.

The year before she started seeing Eriksson she separated from her husband, Anthony with whom she co-owns Salford Skip Hire, after three years of marriage.

She told the Sunday Mirror they would meet at an apartment in Manchester four or five times a week and he promised her that they would go public with their relationship at some point.

Mrs Cauchi says Eriksson said reports he was still with his long-term lover Nancy Dell'Olio were false and he was only in contact with her because they were arguing over money.

Then one day she received a text containing five women's names and phone numbers, followed by another inviting her to talk to the women, who were all allegedly seeing Eriksson.

She claims she could not get hold of him to find out what was happening. He was in Mexico for a new management role and would not take her calls.

They eventually patched things up and resumed seeing each other while he was manager at Notts County in the East Midlands. She admits she was in love with him and in denial over the other women.

After seeing the book, tipped to be a
bestseller, contained no mention of her, she said: 'I actually feel 
sorry for him because if he carries on like this he's going to end up a very lonely old man.'

Neither Ms Cauchi nor Mr Goran Eriksson's representatives were available for comment.

On Thursday it emerged that England boss Sven Goran Eriksson refused to use mobile phones to contact secret lover Faria Alam because he believed his phones were being tapped, the Old Bailey heard on Thursday during the trial of Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson,who both deny conspiring with others to hack phones.

The Swede told her of his fears and would only call her using a landline towards the end of their affair.

Ms Alam said in a statement read to the jury of the trial: ‘We were in contact until July 2005, but it was done by landline telephone because Sven believed his telephone had been tapped.’

This came after a torrent of publicity of their affair sparked by a News of the World expose allegedly fueled by phone hacking.
