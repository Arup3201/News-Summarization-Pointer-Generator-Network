A teenager who doctors feared would never walk again after she smashed into a condo in a terrifying parasailing accident has broken her silence to reveal her grueling recovery.

Alexis Fairchild, 17, was left in critical condition alongside friend Sidney Good on July 1 when their parasail snapped free from its boat in 
Panama City, Florida, leaving the girls soaring through the air.

In an ordeal that was captured on camera by horrified holidaymakers, the girls were heard screaming as they were 
left to the mercy of the wind and thrown against the 13th floor of a condominium.

Alexis, who spoke to the Today show on Thursday just
days after Sidney also conducted her first interview, suffered traumatic
 brain injuries and has needed multiple cranial and back surgeries.

Battle: Alexis Fairchild, 17, was left with brain damage after her parasail broke free from its boat last July and sent her and a friend hurtling into the side of a building. She is now undergoing therapy

Back on her feet: Alexis, pictured with Today reporter Kerry Sanders, said she suffers excruciating back pain

It has left her weak on her feet and with the reading age of a fourth 
grader. She now struggles to brush her teeth, comb her hair or take a shower.

'My independence was completely ripped away,' she told the Today show. 'My life was pretty much ripped away from me and I'm just relearning everything.'

But she has also been left with emotional scars and struggles to sleep.

'It's not really the shocks that keep me
 from sleeping, it's more night terrors,' she said.

'I have really bad nightmares 
about it and I think it's because I remember so much from the accident. I don't go into deep sleep. It's like my mind 
doesn't allow me to shut off.'

Hurt: Alexis, left, was on vacation with her friend Sidney Good, right, in Florida last July when the accident occurred. Alexis revealed that they have not spoken throughout their recoveries

Terrifying: Footage taken from the beach showed the girls hitting the condo and then taking off again

Horror: They flew through the air and eventually hit a power line and dropped on top of a car

Alexis said she has no 
intention of ever watching the terrifying footage of the moment they hit the condo as their screams were heard across the beach.

'I mean, I lived it,' she said. 'I remember a lot. All of it 
actually. I mean to a point where I blacked out.'

After hitting the balcony, the girls were 
thrown into the air again and eventually collided with power lines 
before landing on top of a car in a nearby parking lot.

In a sad twist, she also revealed that she has not been in touch with her best friend, Sidney Good, throughout their recoveries. They are both back home in Huntington, Indiana.

'We're both just trying to get on with 
our lives, you know,' she said. 'We just need to worry about getting 
back to 100 percent recovery.'

Her parents, Mike and Angie, became emotional as they spoke about their fears that they would lose their daughter. They praised her attitude but said they fear for her every day.

Hurt: The girls landed on this parked car in a nearby parking lot and were rushed to hospital

'You relive it every day,' Angie Fairchild said. 'Every day,
 just watching her. Watching her struggle and there's nothing you can do
 to take that away. All because she made the decision to do something 
everybody thought was fun.'

Alexis' family is now suing the 
company, Aquatic Adventures, the largest para-sail firm in the U.S, and the resort that organized the activity.

'They need to have regulations just like everybody else,' Angie said. 'My 17-year-old daughter and her friend. Their whole lives are changed. We don't want another parent to live our nightmare.'

The 
company said it is unable to comment on ongoing litigation.

Alexis, who also attends an alternative school to finish her education, said that she would love to be beside her former high school friends on graduation day.

Recovery: The girls, pictured before the accident, both needed multiple surgeries after suffering head trauma

Injuries: Sidney Good, pictured 
in hospital last year, has not regained all of her eyesight since the accident

Faith: She is pictured praying in the hospital with her parents. She said her belief in God got her through

'If I don't graduate that's fine, but I want to be able to walk with my class that I grew up with,' she said.

Sidney revealed earlier this week that she suffered broken vertebrae and brain trauma.

'About the second day, my body was preparing itself to die,' she told the Today show.

She said that doctors do not 
expect her to make a full recovery; she has double vision constantly and
 her peripheral vision is totally gone - but says she still hopes she 
graduates this year.

When asked what helped her survive the ordeal, she said: 'I'm a very strong believer in God.'

They became detached from the boat 
when their boat dropped anchor due to unusually high and dangerous winds
 and their line snapped.

Anger: Alexis' parents Mike and Angie are now suing the parasailing company and the holiday resort

Family: Sidney's father Eric said doctors did not know if the teenager suffered her life-changing injuries as she hit the building or when she and Alexis fell on top of a car in a parking lot

'These two little girls were just 
screaming bloody murder,' said witness Rick McGee to Indiana News 
Center. 'I could see they were going to contact the condo, and they did 
strike it on the gulf side.'

'It
 was heading towards the condos and they were screaming and it was - it 
was horrific,' another witness, Inga Bobbin, told WJHG.

'And
 they hit the building and then they stopped screaming and it was awful.
 Everybody was trying to get to them and nobody could do anything.'

Earlier
 in the day, Alexis had taken to Twitter to speak of her delight at her 
vacation on the Gulf shores, writing: 'Beach Day!! Its seriously sooo 
beautiful here!'

She later added that they were going parasailing, writing: 'Freaking out.'
