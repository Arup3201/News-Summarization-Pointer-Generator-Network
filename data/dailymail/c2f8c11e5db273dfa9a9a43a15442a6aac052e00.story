Supermarkets are profiteering on fruit and vegetables, a food writer claimed yesterday.

Joanna Blythman said she was shocked by the prices in big stores compared to the continent – where soft fruit, such as peaches, can cost as little as €1.50 (about £1.20) a kilo.

In addition, she said that fruit and vegetables sold by independent traders can cost up to two-thirds less than supermarkets.

Berry sneaky: Joanna Blythman said cherries, nectarines, blueberries are routinely overpriced in the UK

Miss Blythman, who wants an inquiry into fruit and vegetable pricing, told trade magazine The Grocer she had recently been to Italy, where peaches, apricots and nectarines sell for €1.50 to €2 (£1.60) a kilo and cherries for €2.50 (£2) to €5 (£4).

‘That’s for large, mature fruit, streaming with juice, not the puny, green specimens on UK shelves, where one solitary nectarine can knock you back a cool 69p each,’ she said.

The food writer, from Edinburgh, said: 'Most people don’t analyse prices because supermarkets make it hard to do so. Summer berries come in odd-sized containers - 170g, 195g, 320g, for instance - at a pick-up price of £1.99 or £2.99.

'With all those irritating odd numbers, few of us will bother to do the maths.'

'This week, a £2.99 spend at my local greengrocer bought me exactly twice the weight of Spanish blueberries, Scottish raspberries and Italian cherry tomatoes that the nearest supermarket was offering.' 

Can't be bothered: Miss Bluthman said few of us can be bothered to calculate whether our fruit and veg shopping is actually a good deal
