Feeding time doesn't get much cuter than at this panda research centre in China.

These adorable pictures show the baby pandas are more than happy to lie-back and feed themselves their bottle of milk, just like human babies, at the panda sanctuary in the Sichuan Province.

Like after any large meal, one looks particularly sleepy and goes in for a cuddle from a staff member, clutching on as she carries it inside.

The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Research Base – just outside the city of Chengdu – is home to 83 adults and cubs. 

Also known as the Chengdu Panda Base, the facility has been breeding and researching the huge black and white creatures since 1987.

It was created to imitate the pandas' natural habitat to give them the best possible environment for rearing and breeding. 

The not-for-profit research and breeding compound started with six giant pandas that were rescued from the wild. By 2008, it had already had 124 panda births. 

Along with the giant panda, the sanctuary is a refuge to other endangered species such as the red panda, the snow leopard, and the clouded leopard among the 109 species of mammals recorded.
