Charlie Nicholas was forced to apologise on Sky Sports News after he admitted he couldn’t tell the difference between Manchester City midfielders Fernandinho and Fernando because ‘they looked the same’.

The presenter, 53, who made his name as a player at Arsenal, was providing the live analysis on the Premier League game between Everton and champions City at Goodison Park.

And when Fernandinho netted an opener, Jeff Stelling tee’d up Nicholas to describe the action, who said: ‘Goal! Is it Fernandinho or is it Fernando? They both look the same to me.’

The two players are both Brazilian, and started in central midfield during the 1-1 draw as Steven Naismith stole in to cancel out Fernandinho’s flicked header.

Nicholas’ analysis lead to criticism on social media and when the 3pm games finished on Saturday and the dust settled at Sky Sports, Stelling apologised to viewers and the Scot explained his actions.

‘Jeff, they both physically look the same and if sometimes you don’t catch the number, you actually don’t quite know what one is what,’ he said.

Fernandinho, 29, is a Brazil international and was a £34million signing from Shakhtar in 2013, while Fernando, 27, has never been capped for his country and was brought in for £12m from Porto last summer.

According to the Manchester Evening News, City team-mates had taken to calling the pair ‘Dinho’ and ‘Nando’.

The Brazilian midfielder was unmarked in the six-yard box to flick a header into the bottom corner 

And in August, Fernandinho admitted that he had never met Fernando before he arrived in Manchester.

He said: ‘I didn’t know him before, but when he signed for City, I texted him and said ‘Welcome to Man City and I am here to help you. And he said ‘I need you to help me!’

‘In the last two weeks we have worked and lived together. He is a good guy. He is a good professional, good player. And I’m sure he will be a good player for City.

‘We have done things socially. I tell him to try and enjoy the days off, we have spent some time together but also with the other players – we like go to the cinema or do something with the kids.

‘When he joined, I texted him and told him to try and find a house near me so it will make life easier for him and me as well. He is like me – calm and quiet. We have a lot of things in common. Neither of us talk a lot.’
