The future of the new high speed rail line was in turmoil last night after Labour threatened to pull the plug on the £50billion project.

Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls shattered the cross-party consensus on the HS2 line, signalling that there would be ‘no blank cheque’ from a future Labour government and that the money could be better spent on housing.

Mr Balls sparked deep divisions in Labour, which originally devised the project, by warning that his party would kill the project unless it proves to be value for money.

Buffers: Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls signaled that he thought the £50billion earmarked for HS2 could be better spent elsewhere

His intervention will embolden Tory critics of HS2 – the biggest infrastructure project in British history – who are set to demand an end to the project at their party conference next week.

In his conference speech, Mr Balls said: ‘The question is – not just whether a new high speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50billion for the future of our country.’

The official cost of the project, including contingency funds, has recently climbed from £33billion to £42.6billion. The cost of new rolling stock will bring that to £50billion but independent experts have warned that the cost could spiral to £70billion or more.

Mr Balls said Labour still backs a new ‘North-South rail link’ but at a fringe meeting last night Mr Balls said: ‘What I’m not going to do is write a blank cheque politically.

Every billion pounds you spend on HS2 is a billion pounds you won’t spend on roads or cross-county train links or building new homes or new schools or new hospitals or other parts of the infrastructure.

He adds: ‘I think it’s about time to inject some hard thinking.’

His deputy Rachel Reeves added: ‘We would cancel if it we did not think it was good value for money.’

Mr Balls’ speech thrilled opponents of
the project. Joe Rukin of Stop HS2   said: ‘Ed Balls is dead right to 
question whether HS2 is worth it.’

But frontbenchers openly suggested he 
had gone further than Ed Miliband would like. A member of the shadow 
cabinet said: ‘Ed Balls is much more sceptical about it that Ed 
Miliband.’ Sources close to the Labour leader said he had read and 
approved Mr Balls’ speech and claimed the ‘policy hasn’t changed’.

Former Labour transport secretary Lord
Adonis, the architect of the project, warned last month that cancelling
the project would be an ‘act of national self-mutilation’.

Last night he flatly refused to comment on Mr Balls’ intervention.

But Graham Stringer, a Manchester MP, 
condemned Mr Balls’ intervention as ‘a huge mistake’. Sir Richard Leese,
the Labour leader of Manchester City Council, said: ‘The capacity that 
HS2 brings is essential to our economic future.’

A Department for Transport spokesman 
said: ‘HS2 is the right thing to do for the future of the country, which
is why it has cross party support.’

Mr Balls also declared himself a proud
socialist yesterday. The Shadow Chancellor unveiled plans to give 
parents of three and four year olds 25 hours of free childcare a week – 
the £800million costs paid for with a new bank tax. He repeated pledges 
made earlier this year to match Coalition spending plans for 2015/16 and
warned: ‘The next Labour government will have to make cuts too.’

Mr Balls said a Labour government 
would inherit ‘a very difficult situation’ and would have to show 
‘fiscal responsibility in the national interest’.

But Mr Balls’ claims he would exercise
‘iron discipline’ were undermined as he echoed Ed Miliband’s admission 
at the weekend that his party is ushering in a return to socialism.

The Shadow Chancellor said: Of course, I’ve always used the word socialism,’ he told the BBC.

In his speech, Mr Balls made £7.5 
billion of spending commitments, including the childcare pledge, a 
return of the 10p income tax rate, plans to fund more youth jobs and 
repeal of the so-called bedroom tax.

But he only offered just over £1 billion of tax rises to pay for the plans.

Network Rail's priority should be fixing the parts of the rail network that are falling to bits.

Everybody knows this will go way over budget and won't be completed on time(if itr goes ahead). That is the way Network Rail like to operate.

I can't stand this man! Seeing him during PM Question Time is more than I can stand. I call him the Nodding Dog (sorry dogs!) because all he does is nod at everything Mili says - his head goes up and down, up and down non-stop! And then there is Harriet on the other side of Mili doing the same thing, and they look like a comic act! Stupid, stupid people. Thank goodness we are not taken in by any of their empty promises...

I thought this was Labour plan A to have lots of infrastructure projects to boost the economy. Is it going through to many Unions leaders gardens?

If you believe this will ever happen you are kidding yourselves. The clue is in the word COULD derail HS2. Another sham like the referendum vote on the EU.

They won't give you the chance to cancel it, Mr Balls, they will under-write massive compensation payments should there be any cancellation. Either way they are going to get rich and we are going to pay.

If true this is the first and probably last times I agree with Balls

Anything Balls says will only apply until they get voted in.

They sound like Torys!
