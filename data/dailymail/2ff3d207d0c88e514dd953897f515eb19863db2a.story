Three Florida teenagers took advantage of their Labor Day off.

Police in Polk County arrested three high schoolers, saying the teens commandeered a school bus for an extracurricular trip through central Florida, picking up their friends along the way.

According to officials, the teens came across an unlocked bus with the keys left inside at a lot next to Lake Wales High School.

The group took the bus off the lot and drove through several towns, stopping to pick up three friends along the way.

Caught: The teenagers covered up three video cameras on the bus but a fourth caught them walking through the bus

According to ABC Action News, the bus was gone from 10:30 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. Monday morning.

The group dropped the bus off unscathed at the school, having clocked 180 during their joyride.

The school only realized something was amiss when a routine inspection of the bus on Tuesday showed fuel missing and extra mileage on the odometer.

The high schoolers had covered three of the bus's security cameras, but apparently failed to locate the fourth, which caught two of the teens on tape.

The Tampa Bay Tribune reports the teenagers were identified by a staff member at Lake Wales High School, where one of the teenagers is a student.

The other students attend nearby schools.

Police arrested the three minors and charged them with grand theft auto and trespassing on school property.

The three friends that joined them for the ride were also charged with trespassing on school property.
