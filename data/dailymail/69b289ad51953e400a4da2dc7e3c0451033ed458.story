Danish singer Emmelie de Forest has won this year's Eurovision Song Contest with her song Only Teardrops.

The blonde, who sang in English, was crowned this year's winner following the lengthy spectacle in Malmo, Sweden.

The UK's entry Bonnie Tyler ended up in a disappointing 19th place after failing to win enough votes from the participating countries.

Rousing the crowd: The blonde was accompanied by drummers for her winning song

Bizarrely, the host officially declared Denmark was the winner before returning to Cyprus and Croatia to take their votes. 

However, the winner was clear, with Denmark being 47 points ahead of second place, Azerbaijan's Farid Mammadov.

In third place was Ukraine's Zlata Ognevich with Gravity.

As always, politics and neighborliness proved to be a dominating factor for many of the votes.

Welsh singer Bonnie, who scored huge hits in the 1980s with Total Eclipse Of The Heart and Holding Out For A Hero, was the 15th act to perform on the night, which saw 26 acts take to the stage.

Although she didn't received many points, she did received a rapturous reception from the audience following her performance of Believe In Me.

The 61-year-old star belted out the track in a black off-the-shoulder dress, and managed a quick 'thank you' following her set.

Scream and shout: The singer didn't hold back when it came to showing her delight

Laughter: As Emmelie held up the award the emotion could really be seen on her face

Overwhelming: The winner looked like she might need a few minutes to take in what had happened

Better than last year! Bonnie Tyler ended up in 19th place, compared to last year's 25th place

Bonnie's placing comes after veteran singer Engelbert Humperdinck finished second last for the UK at last year's ceremony. 

UK's neighbour, Ireland's Ryan Dolan was the last of the 26 acts to perform with dance song Only Love Survives.

One of the entries making waves on social networking site was Finland's Krista Siegfrids' Marry Me.

Go Bonnie! She may not have won, but the Welsh singer got a good support from the audience

Not bad: Greece;s Koza Mostra feat. Agathon Iakovidis's Alcohol Is Free ended up in sixth place

Causing controversy: Finland's Krista Siegfrids' protested against a ban on gay marriage with her track Marry Me

Disappointing: Ryan Dolan of Ireland was in last place

In a bid to make a statement about 
her country's ban on gay marriage, Krista shared a kiss with a blonde 
female at the climax of her song.

Romania entry Cezar put on quite a flamboyant performance of his track It's My Life.

Wearing
 a bizarre, black outfit, he sang in an incredibly high falsetto while 
dancers moved around him dressed in nude underwear.

Opening the show: France's Amandine Bourgeois was first to perform, followed by Lithuania's Andrius Pojavis

Shiny disco balls: Belarus singer Alyona Lanskaya jumped out of a giant disco ball
