David Cameron is drawing up explosive plans to force an early referendum on Scottish independence.

The Prime Minister is preparing to call the bluff of Scotland’s nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond by changing the law to allow him to go to the polls – but only if he dares to do so within the next 18 months.

Mr Cameron said yesterday a referendum should be held ‘sooner rather than later’, adding: ‘I don’t think we should just let this go on year after year.’

But his move brought criticism from north of the border today when Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Cameron is 'seeking to interfere' with the democratic rights of the Scottish people by trying to impose conditions on the format and timing of an independence referendum.

Call my bluff: Prime Minister David (left) could change the law to allow Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond (right) to hold a referendum

Amid growing alarm in London that support is inching upwards in Scotland for the break-up of the 300-year-old Union with England, the Government will publish legal advice this week suggesting a poll ordered by Holyrood could only be ‘consultative’.

For the result to be legally binding on the UK government, Westminster will have to agree – though it would be unthinkable for Parliament simply to ignore a ‘yes’ vote.

Mr Cameron is now planning to amend the law to allow a binding referendum, but within a fixed time period.

The Government will also launch a consultation with the Scottish people on the wording of the referendum.

A question of timing: Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond wants to hold a referendum on the anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, when he hopes nationalist feelings will be running high

The move is a huge gamble, which some 
fear may backfire if Mr Salmond is able to claim Westminster is trying 
to dictate to Holyrood. 

The Scottish leader is plotting to hold a referendum in 2014, to coincide with the 700th anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn, Scotland’s most famous military victory over England, and the country’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games, when he hopes nationalist sentiment will be at its peak.

And speaking on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme, Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish people had 'overwhelmingly' voted the SNP into power in Holyrood last year, returning the nationalist party with a majority.

She said there was 'clarity' north of the border about the SNP commitment to hold the referendum in the second half of the Parliament.

Reports suggest the Government in Westminster is considering offering the Scottish Parliament the chance to hold a legally binding referendum but only on the basis of a simple yes or no question and if it is held within a certain timeframe, thought to be 18 months.

'This is a blatant attempt to interfere in the decision that is really one for the Scottish Government in terms of the timing of the referendum and for the Scottish people in terms of the outcome.

'We were elected on the basis of our commitment to have a referendum in the second half of this parliamentary term.

'This is about Westminster seeking to interfere.

Going it alone: Scottish MPs at Holyrood could run a legally binding referendum on whether to split from England

'We said very clearly in the election
that our immediate priority if elected would be to seek to strengthen 
the Scotland Bill, currently going through the Westminster Parliament, 
to give the Scottish Parliament important economic job-creating powers, a
referendum on independence in the second half of this parliamentary 
term.'

Ms Sturgeon said 'most people' in 
Scotland listening to Mr Cameron would only hear a London-based, 
Tory-led Government trying to intervene on Scottish decision-making.

The Scottish Nationalists also hope 
voters will be angry after several years of spending cuts implemented by
an ‘English’ government.

While
polls suggest a majority of Scots want to maintain the Union with 
England, support for independence is creeping ever higher. There are 
also fears that Mr Salmond wants to try to ‘rig’ the referendum with a 
confusing question – probably offering more options than a simple ‘yes’ 
or ‘no’.

Voters could also
be given the choice of ‘devo max’, in which Scotland would be granted 
much greater financial freedom but would remain within the UK.

Mr
Cameron said yesterday: ‘The uncertainty about this issue I think is 
damaging to Scotland and Scotland’s economy, because you have companies 
and other organisations asking “well what’s Scotland’s future? Is it 
within the United Kingdom or not?” That’s damaging.’

The
Prime Minister said the United Kingdom was ‘one of the most successful 
partnerships in the history of the world’ and should be fought hard for.

‘It would be desperately 
sad if Scotland chose to leave the United Kingdom and I will do 
everything I can to encourage Scotland to stay in the United Kingdom 
because I think that is the best for all our economies, Scotland 
included, and all our societies,’ he said.

‘Let’s not drift apart. I think he 
[Alex Salmond] knows the Scottish people at heart do not want a full 
separation and so he is trying to create a situation where that bubbles 
up and happens whereas I think we need some decisiveness so we can clear
up this issue.

‘I don’t think we should just let this go on year after year... My view is that sooner rather than later would be better.’

Government
sources suggested the new Scotland Bill, which is still making its way 
through parliament, may be amended to allow Holyrood to run a legally 
binding poll – but include a ‘sunset clause’ setting a time limit.

Lib
Dem Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, who represents a 
Scottish seat at Westminster, said: ‘Scotland cannot afford – literally 
cannot afford – a long period of dithering and delay from Alex Salmond, 
because what that will cost is jobs and growth in the Scottish economy.’

A spokesman for Mr 
Salmond said: ‘The Scottish Government achieved an overwhelming mandate 
from the people of Scotland to hold the referendum in the second half of
this parliamentary term, and that is exactly what we will do.’

According
to the latest poll, conducted by Ipsos Mori last month, 38 per cent of 
Scots now favour independence – three points up since the summer.
