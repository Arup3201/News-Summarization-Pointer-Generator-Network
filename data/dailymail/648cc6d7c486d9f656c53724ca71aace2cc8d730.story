Nick Clegg launched a fresh assault on benefits for better-off pensioners yesterday.

Calling for a debate on ‘welfare for the wealthy’, the deputy Prime Minister indicated he would like to see affluent pensioners lose benefits such as the winter fuel allowance and free bus passes before the election.

He condemned a climbdown by the Department for Work and Pensions over its bid to stop sending the winter fuel allowance, which is worth up to £300 a year, to British pensioners living in warm countries such as Spain and Greece.

Welfare warning: Nick Clegg said today that further welfare cuts will have to be made but the Liberal Democrats would not allow the poorest to be targeted first

Iain Duncan Smith had planned a new 
‘temperature test’ but the move has been blocked by Downing Street, 
partly because of concerns that some pensioners would lose out in a mild
winter.

The move means an extra 120,000 expat
pensioners living in Europe are now likely to get the payments, which 
were restricted to those who had moved abroad after retiring in Britain.

Clegg said: ‘We need to have a debate about 
welfare for the wealthy. That is being blocked at the moment because the
Conservatives don’t want to have that debate, and that’s why we can’t 
move forward with the wider reforms to our welfare system.’

The Liberal Democrat leader also 
hinted he had not abandoned hopes of getting a deal in the tense 
negotiations surrounding the Comprehensive Spending Review for 2015-6.

'I think the fact we are asking people on low incomes to pay through their taxes to basically pay the fuel bills of people who don't need to heat their homes because they are living in sunny parts of Europe and maybe didn't even work here, I think that lifts the lid on a wider problem in our welfare system,' Mr Clegg told the BBC One Andrew Marr programme.

'Yes, we need welfare reform. We have already made, with my full support, significant savings to welfare.

Warning: Mr Clegg, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, said that handouts to the elderly should therefore not automatically be exempt from cuts

'But if you're going to make further welfare savings, which I am prepared to look at, then you've got to start at the top, you've got to start with welfare for the wealthy, benefits paid to the rich and the retired.'

The Labour Party announced earlier this month it would strip the wealthiest pensioners of the winter fuel allowance if it wins the 2015 General Election.

And speaking last weekend, shadow chancellor Ed Balls said he planned to include pension spending inside Labour's proposal for a welfare cap - adding later that the party was committed to the coalition's 'triple lock' pension increase reforms.

David Cameron has pledged benefits 
for older pensioners will not be cut before the election, and Tory 
sources last night confirmed that included the period of the new 
spending review. ‘This is non-negotiable,’ a source said. ‘The Prime 
Minister made a pledge and we will stick to it.’

Labour opposed Coalition measures to bring down the welfare bill, including a £26,000 cap on households and below inflation benefit increases.

Last week, in an attempt to regain credibility on the economy, Labour leader Ed Miliband said the party was prepared to back the Government’s idea of a cap on so-called ‘structural’ welfare spending for three years from 2015-16.
