Hundreds of protesters have clashed with police in Brazil as the government was set to announce the result of a controversial auction of exploration rights for the country's biggest oilfield.

But it seemed that some Brazilians retained their laid-back cool amid the scenes of upset, by continuing to sunbathe throughout.

Brazilian security forces and protesters clashed in Barra da Tijuca, near Rio de Janeiro, where today the government was auctioning the massive - and potentially lucrative -  Libra offshore oil block.

The government deployed more than a thousand troops around the beach front Windsor hotel where the auction will take place.

Officers cordoned off streets to prevent 
protesters from disrupting an event that President Dilma Rousseff has 
billed as a crowning achievement of an energy plan aimed at ending 
poverty and vaulting Brazil to the ranks of developed nations.

The
field was discovered in 2010, and could almost double Brazil’s oil 
reserves, garnering more than £100bn investment over 35 years.

The protesters include members of unions representing oil workers, who have accused the government of 'selling off' and privatising Brazil's natural riches.

Members have been on strike since Thursday at more than 40 oil platforms and refineries.

Brazil’s state-run oil company, Petrobras, would be the sole operator of the field according to the terms. 

As part of the agreement more than 40 per cent of recovered oil would go to the state.

Brazilian officials are counting on the oil riches to quickly catapult the nation to developed-world status.

State officials are locked in arguments about how to split royalties that haven't surfaced, the Navy is buying submarines to protect the fields and left-wing protesters like those demonstrating on Monday demand that the entire industry be nationalised so Brazil doesn't share a drop of the wealth.

But the technology hurdles to reaching the riches are intensely challenging, even for Petrobras, considered a world leader in offshore development.

The deep-water reservoirs lie some 185 miles (300 kilometers) offshore in the Atlantic, more than a mile below the ocean's surface and under another 2.5 miles  of earth and corrosive salt. The salt beds can break loose and shear off piping, making it one of the toughest substances to drill.

With a slowing economy and delays in producing that offshore oil, some say the Brazilian government will loosen rules to make them more business friendly when the next auction is held in two to three years.

The New York-based Eurasia Group said in a research note that Petrobras' 'growing operational and financial constraints' along with government pressure to stoke a lagging national economy means changes are expected at the next auction.

'Allowing international oil companies to develop the pre-salt side by side with Petrobras would kill two birds with one stone,' Eurasia Group wrote.

'It would lead to a quicker pace of production in the pre-salt with more investments, and provide needed relief to Petrobras.'

It added that 'it isn't lost on government officials that the shale gas and tight oil technological revolution in North America has reduced Brazil's leverage to attract capital.'

Among the demonstrators were the masked, black-clad 'Black Bloc' anarchists who have a growing role in Brazil's steady drumbeat of protests.

The demonstration was originally called by striking oil workers, whose union has long been against any foreign involvement in Brazil's petroleum production.
