The schoolboy who murdered teacher Ann Maguire is on 24-hour suicide watch and has already been moved from a young offender institution after violence threats, it was claimed today.

William Cornick, 16, was sentenced on Monday to life in jail with a minimum of 20 years after stabbing to death 61-year-old Mrs Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College in Leeds in April.

At first the boy was held at Wetherby Young Offender Institution (YOI) in West Yorkshire but is said to have since been moved to another undisclosed YOI for his own safety.

Jail: An HM Inspectorate of Prisons report last year said the vast majority of young people at Wetherby Young Offender Institution, which holds about 230 youths, reported feeling safe

Cornick - one of 16 children serving indeterminate life sentences in Britain’s YOIs - had been held on the Anson wing in Wetherby, which is designed for long-term inmates, reported The Times.

The boy was seen to be at risk from other convicts and placed in solitary confinement in a cell with a glass door, according to a report submitted to Leeds Crown Court by his defence team.

The Anson wing is now the only dedicated juvenile unit in England and Wales for young people with life or long-term determinate sentences, according to an HM Inspectorate of Prisons report last year.

It said the vast majority of young people at Wetherby, which holds about 230 youths, reported feeling safe - although incidents of self-harm were ‘higher than in comparable establishments’.

Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, claimed yesterday that the decision to by Mr Justice Coulson to lift Cornick’s anonymity order was not in the public interest.

She wrote in The Guardian: ‘The child will be notorious inside prison and will never be able to grow past the crime he committed. The crime is now his permanent identity.’

And Penelope Gibbs, who chairs the Standing Committee for Youth Justice (SCYJ) umbrella group of charities and campaign groups, said yesterday that the sentence was too long.

She told BBC Radio 4: ‘I don't think a child - and he was a child - should get a life sentence because they are young, their brain is not mature and a life sentence is indeterminate, it could last forever.’

Mrs Gibbs added: ‘He needs to be in prison, he needs to be rehabilitated so he's no longer a danger to himself and others - but a minimum of 20 years is too long.’

Part of Cornick's rehabilitation could see him return to a classroom during his sentence.

Brian Hamilton, chair of the Manchester College: University and College Union prison branch, said Cornick could be taught in a class of around eight people with a focus on basic literacy and numeracy skills and vocational training to ensure prisoners are employable on their release.

Cornick, who took and passed five GCSEs a year early, would be unlikely to be able to study for higher level qualifications.

Mr Hamilton, who teaches in prisons, said: ‘I believe this young man is quite intelligent. He would probably be above the level they are trying to take them to in that establishment.’

Cornick attacked Mrs Maguire after boasting to friends that he was going to kill her. He also said he was going to murder other teachers, including a pregnant woman ‘so as to kill her unborn child’.

He later told doctors: ‘I said I was going to do other stuff but I never got the chance, other murders. It was a triple homicide.’

After the murder the teenager told psychiatrists that he ‘couldn't give a s***’ and added: ‘Everything I've done is fine and dandy.’

A Ministry of Justice spokesman declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline today.
