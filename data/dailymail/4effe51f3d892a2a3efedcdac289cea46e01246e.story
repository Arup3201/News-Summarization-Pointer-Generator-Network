A British sailor hopes to break the world record for circumnavigating the globe in a powerboat shaped like a torpedo.

Alan Priddy, 61, plans to beat the previous record of 60 days, 23 hours and 49 minutes held by Pete Bethune from New Zealand. 

The world record attempt is expected to start on November 1 next year and will stop at 10 countries around the world for refuelling including Puerto Rico, Honolulu and Singapore.

The team hope to begin construction of the 80ft boat early next year so they can start the voyage in November

Mr Priddy, from Portsmouth, conceived the idea four years ago and has now secured £2.9million in funding. 

The project team, named Team Britannia, hope to begin construction of the 80 foot boat early next year so they can set off from Gibraltar on their 24,000 mile voyage next year. 

The 'floating fuel tank' has been designed to pierce waves rather than surfing across them, which the team hope will  make the trip smoother than a boat with a conventional hull.

Made from marine-grade aluminium - 80 per cent of which will be recycled - it will carry 7,700 gallons of what the team say is a revolutionary emulsion fuel, which reduces harmful emissions such as nitrous oxide when burned. 

It will have an estimated top speed of 34.4 knots and an estimated average speed of 22.5 knots.

Length of vessel - 80 feet

Empty weight - 16 tons

Fully laden weight - 45 tons

Estimated top speed (light) - 34.4 knots

Estimated top speed (heavy) - 18.1 knots

Gallon fuel tank - 7,700

Design and build costs - £2.9million

Fuel saved by streamlined hull - 30 per cent

Made from recycled aluminium -  80 per cent

Mr Priddy, who has already beaten 37 world records on sea, said: 'This project is the culmination of a lifetime's work that I hope will highlight the amazing qualities and skills that we have in abundance in our country - the best sailors, engineers, boat builders and designers.

'This is why when we started this project six years ago we called ourselves Team Britannia.

'We have the finest maritime designers, builders and sailors in the world. The British boat Cable & Wireless Adventurer first set the round the world powerboat record in 1998 and held it for nearly a decade.

'When this record, the pinnacle of powerboating, was lost to the New Zealand boat Earthrace, I knew we had an amazing opportunity to once again showcase the best of British. To show why our marine industry is still the best.

'Team Britannia aims to do just that. It brings together just a few of the people who make Britain and our marine sector great.'

The route will see the team head west from Gibraltar, with stops at Puerto Rico, Acapulco in Mexico, Honolulu, Guam, Singapore, Oman and Malta to take on fuel.

To complete the record attempt the boat must pass through the Suez and Panama Canals, cross the Tropic of Cancer and the Equator, and start and finish in the same place.

Mr Priddy will set off with a crew of seven and hopes to offer a place to injured servicemen or women on each leg of the voyage.
