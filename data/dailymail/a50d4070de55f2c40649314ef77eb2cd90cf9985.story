Slammed: Wayne Rooney has been censured for passing off an advertisement for Nike as a personal comment on his Twitter account

Wayne Rooney has been censured for passing off an advertisement for Nike as a personal comment on his Twitter account.

The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruling comes amid mounting concern that celebrities are cashing in by turning Twitter into an advertising platform.

Many celebrities are promoting products and luxury brands via tweets in return for freebies.

Some, particularly in the US, go further and are being paid by big companies to promote their businesses.

Famous names such as Kim Kardashian, who has more than 15million followers, can earn thousands of pounds for a  one-line endorsement on Twitter.

Rap star and actor Snoop Dogg and actress Lindsay Lohan have also cashed in.

In the US, the Federal Trade Commission insists that stars must include the word ‘ad’ or ‘spon’ to show if something is an advert or sponsored.

Similarly, British celebrities are required to make clear where a tweet is part of a commercial arrangement under a code that is policed by the ASA.

England footballer Rooney and his sponsors Nike failed to comply, while a similar tweet from Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere also broke the rules.

The Rooney tweet read: 'My resolution – to start the year as a champion, and finish it as a champion... #makeitcount gonike.me/make itcount (a link to a film and promotion campaign for Nike)'.

The ASA said: ‘We understood that, as part of their sponsorship deal with Nike, the footballers were required to take part in marketing activities and that both were asked to submit their own ideas as to what to write as part of their tweet.

'We understood that the tweet’s final content was agreed with the help of a member of the Nike marketing team.'

However, the watchdog said: ‘We considered there was nothing obvious in the tweets to indicate they were Nike marketing communications.

'In the absence of such an indication, for example #ad, we considered the tweets were not obviously identifiable as Nike marketing communications and therefore concluded they breached the code.'

The watchdog has banned any repeat of the tweets in their  current form and it has put Nike on notice that it must ensure any advertising on Twitter is clearly identified.

Nike said the use of the company’s name in the tweets should have been sufficient to alert people who follow Rooney and Wilshere that they were commercial messages.

The ASA is receiving an increasing number of complaints in relation to stealth advertisements via Twitter and Facebook.

The Office of Fair Trading has also warned celebrities and big brands against using what it describes as 'deceptive' advertising. It said: ‘Online advertising and marketing practices that do not disclose they include paid for promotions are deceptive under trading laws.'

Nina Best, a specialist in brands and advertising law at legal firm Browne Jacobson, said: 'This ruling does not mean the end to celebrity endorsement on social media. However, brands will need to become more aware and more creative when it comes to social media marketing.

'The advertising watchdog will not let social media slip through its gloves, so brands need to pay close attention to their social media campaign messages.'
