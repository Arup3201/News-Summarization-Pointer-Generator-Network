As we prepare to ring 2013 this evening, the thoughts of many of us will already be turning to our New Year's resolution.

From diets to exercise regimes or hunting for new jobs, the intention is often there - but in reality, most vows soon fall by the wayside.

Not so for one woman though - who at the start of 2011 vowed to carry out a good deed for every single day of the coming year. A full 365 days later, she has succeeded in her mission.

Judith O'Reilly, 48, has done a grand total of 365 good deeds last year, from picking up litter on the beach to making cups of tea for other people's builders.

Good deeds: Author Judith O'Reilly from has written a book about doing one good deed every day such as making her elderly blind mother Veronica  a cup of tea

As her deeds started to mount up, Judith decided to record them and has now written a book about her challenge: A Year of Doing Good.

'I didn't realise when I made the resolution that New Year what I was taking on,' she says in the epilogue to her book.

'I'd made resolutions before... but the idea of doing one good deed a day morphed into something else again.

'This year made me question what a good life is, how we give our lives meaning, and what it is to love.

'It also taught me that people don't always want the good you want to do, and that doing good - believe you me - is harder than it looks.'

O'Reilley goes onto say that the year of doing good is really an admission of her own failings.

'My parents are saints, and it is tough being the parents of saints,' she jokes.

'People feel sorry for the children of murderers, because they think it must be hard worrying whether you've inherited a genetic predisposition to kill as well as those long-lobed ears.

'It is worse when you're brought up by those who are good. Really good.'

She calls 2011 the year that for her part, she 'tried to be good'.

'When I can't remember something by name or that shoes should match, I know I'll still remember these years, and that for a year at least, I tried to be good,' she writes.

All in a year's work: From picking up litter on the beach to helping out at a local farm, Judith completed one good deed every day in 2011

A Year Of Doing Good is writer and journalist Judith's third book - her first, Wife In The North, was a bestseller; her second she says is 'living in a drawer' - and this one, her third, she says it is the one she wanted to write in order to help make her a better person.

After seeing all the good that her parents and other people had done, she wanted 2011 to be the year of her doing good.

Reflecting on her past year, Judith from Alnwick, Northumberland, humorously concluded there were both good and bad things.

One such bad thing, she writes, is: 'I am still writing a bloody novel, and everyone who reads it says it is pants.'

Charitable: Judith threw herself into plenty of charity work too and even started a jam jar collection where she and others raised £26,000

Judith's comical tone continues throughout the book and has been highly commended by critics and readers alike.

She even makes tongue-in-cheek digs at her husband throughout the book, writing: 'My other New Year's resolution is to stay married. If at all possible'.

Each chapter is dedicated to a resolution and they range from tidying a vase of flowers that had fallen over at a child's grave to giving the Queen some blooms when she visited a nearby town.

Author: The journalist and author has already written two books, one of which was a bestseller

Her charity work was extensive too. She became a companion for cancer patients, taught mentally disabled children to write and worked with Operation Christmas Child packing shoe boxes.

She even set up her own charity collection called the Jam Jar Army whereby she put any loose change into a jam jar. Thousands of people joined her and raised an amazing £26,000 for a variety of good causes.

A year of good deeds: Journalist and writer Judith has now published a book of all her good deeds which has been met with rave reviews

The whimsical yet sentimental book has been met with critical acclaim.

Stephen G. Post, Phd, Author Of The Hidden Gifts of Helping wrote: 'A Year of Doing Good inspires the reader with the day-to-day journey of meaning, gratification and joy that comes from contributing to the lives of others in so many creative ways.

'For those who want to put "do unto others" in the centre of their lives and reap the unexpected benefits of happiness and health, this is the book for you.

'Elegantly written, the words jump off the page,' he said.

Jenny Colgan, author of Amanda's Wedding on Wife in the North, said: 'I howled with laughter, tears of recognition at every bloody page.

'My only problem with this book was choosing who to pass it on to first.'

Amazon readers were most impressed and touched by the book too with one user writing: 'Beautifully written; a book you won't be able to put down.

'Judith's ability to charm her readers with yet another expertly crafted account of her life as mum, wife, daughter, friend and all round decent human being, continues to embrace and pull at heart-strings.

'I simply love her style of writing; the wit, the humour, the sadness, it's all there - thought provoking and inspirational.'

Claire Thorburn wrote: 'Who could have imagined good deeds to fellow men could garner such twists, emotions and ponderings?

'Wife in the North meets Mother Teresa in this beautifully crafted book with its gritty quick-fire wit. It had me alternatively chortling, sniffling and questioning.

'A must-read book with more layers than a best-in-show prize onion.'
