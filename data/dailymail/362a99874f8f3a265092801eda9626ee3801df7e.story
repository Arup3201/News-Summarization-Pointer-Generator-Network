A businessman has ended up in court – for spanking his wife.

John Smith, 60, put spouse Kim across his knee and smacked her bottom five times following a row over money, a court heard.

When police turned up to investigate he simply told them: ‘She deserved it.’ Magistrates this week issued a restraining order against Smith, who has been married for 18 years.

Skegness 
magistrates’ court heard the assault took place at one of the couple’s 
homes in Lincolnshire in July when a row over a £3,000 loan got out of 
hand. 

As voices were raised, Mrs Smith feared she was going to be beaten, said prosecutor Marie Stace.

Smith then grabbed her by the arm, held her face down on a sofa and smacked her several times, she added.

Asad Aziz, defending, said Smith had seen red after being called offensive names by his wife during the argument.

He
 described how the businessman could not accept the ‘disrespect and 
conduct she displayed that day’ and openly admitted he had put her over 
his knee and smacked her five times. 

Smith had complained that the words she used were ‘unnecessary and uncalled for’, he said.

Outlining
 the married couple’s complicated home life, Mr Aziz explained how they 
ran separate businesses in different parts of the country – both 
financed by Smith – and each had homes near their respective workplaces.

Mrs
 Smith ran an American-style diner in the Lincolnshire coastal resort of
 Ingoldmells while her husband ran a fairground business in Hayes, West 
London.

Magistrates
 heard that after seeing to his own business affairs Smith would visit 
his wife’s home in nearby Chapel St Leonards every week or two. 

The
 row erupted after Smith, who had been working at the Commonwealth Games
 in Glasgow, returned to his wife’s home to find a builder who was owed 
money for work at the diner and another property next to it.

Mr
 Aziz said Smith handed over a bag containing around £5,000 to him to 
pay the debt but an argument developed and his wife started to sling 
insults.

Smith admitted assault by beating and was given a 12-month conditional discharge and a 12-month restraining order.

He was also ordered to pay £85 in costs and a £15 victim surcharge to his wife.
