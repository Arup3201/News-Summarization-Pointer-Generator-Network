Neighbours say the rich parents of children at one of Australia's most expensive schools are 'abusive' and 'think they own the place'. 

Parents at Scots College Preparatory School, in Bellevue Hill, in east Sydney, have come under fire for their 'uncontrollable unsafe behaviour' involving their flashy cars outside the gates.

Even some of the parents told Daily Mail Australia others are 'narcissistic' and 'above the law'.

The traffic piled up out the front of Scots College on Friday afternoon

The ‘risky and/or illegal’ behaviour of parents with cars such as Mercedes, BMWs, Audis and huge black Range Rovers has seen the school have its planning permission application to expand rejected in court. 

Scots bought a house nearby in Kambala Road for $4.8 million in 2009 and wanted to turn it into an early learning centre but Woollahra Council refused, the Sydney Morning Herald reported this morning.

When the case appeared in the NSW Land and Environment Court, Senior Commissioner Tim Moore blasted parents and their problematic parking, which he called 'dangerous parental activities'. 

‘A significant number of parents dropping off and/or picking up children from the preparatory school pay no regard to the law, child safety or the instructions given by the preparatory school,’ Mr Moore said in a damning statement.

As the expensive cars rolled up to the pick-up point at the school on Friday afternoon, most cars were well behaved under the watchful eye of the Director of Early Learning, Gay Entwhistle, who was supervising in an orange glow vest.

Janet, a mother of three boys, told Daily Mail Australia some of the Four Wheel Drives other parents used to pick up their children were 'frightening'.

'If any of the littler children run out, it can be really dangerous because (the drivers) just can't see them.'

Maria, a mother of two young boys, said the residents should get 'real' and were 'horribly unfriendly'.

'The school has been here 105 years,' she said. 'And the school ain't moving.'

'When it's hectic like now, what are you going to do?' 

Helen, another mother, said: 'It's not the parking, it's the speed at which some of them are driving.'  

One of the pictures used as evidence in the court judgement shows residents trying to leave their house but apparently being blocked by vehicles in the service road.

In a court hearing from 22 to 24 September 2014, an inspector said he was given evidence, informally, by six local residents 'who objected to the proposed change of use'.

He was also given 'pictorial and graphic materials presented in support of that oral evidence'.

Scots College principal Ian Lambert told the paper he was ‘extremely’ disappointed with the judgement.

‘The safety and wellbeing of our boys is always our primary concern,’ he said.

Scots College is an independent Presbyterian day and boarding school for boys that has around 1800 students.

The prestigious private school does not make their fees public, but in 2013 they were reported to be $30,900 a year.

Notable former students at the school include Olympians such as water polo player Thomas Whalan, film director Peter Lindsay Weir, and the former Governor of New South Wales Admiral Sir David James Martin.
