Hillary Clinton said on Tuesday that she has no 'absolutely no' interest in giving pot a try.

'I didn't do it when I was young, I'm not gonna start now,' Clinton told CNN's Christiane Amanpour during a televised town hall on Tuesday.

The subject brought out Clinton's lighter side, sending the often stoic former secretary of state into giggles.

'There are younger people here who can help me understand this and answer it,' Clinton jovially said as soon as the question about her views on marijuana appeared on screen at the town hall.

Perhaps Hillary's husband Bill Clinton could also help her understand the allure of weed.

Bill infamously said during his 1992 presidential election that, 'When I was in 
England, I experimented with marijuana a time or two, and didn't like 
it.

'I didn't inhale, and I didn't try it again,' he said.

Prior to Tuesday's town hall it was unclear if Hillary had ever puffed the magic dragon.

The last time that Clinton publicly commented on marijuana was during the 2008 presidential election.

At that time she said, 'I don't think we should decriminalize, but we ought to do research into what, if any, medical benefits it has.'

Six years later, and Clinton's views on use of the substance haven't budged.

'IÂ think we need to be very clear about the benefits of marijuana use
 for medicinal purposes. I don't think we've done enough research yet,' Clinton told an audience of about 200 people during CNN's town hall style event.

'There's a lot that we don't know,' she said, such as how it reacts with other drugs.

The presumed 2016 candidate said medical marijuana should be available 'under appropriate circumstances' to people with 'extreme medical conditions,' however.

As to whether she thinks that recreational marijuana use should be decriminalized, Clinton said she wanted to 'wait and see what the evidence is' coming out of Colorado and Washington, two states that recently made recreational use legal.

'You know that states are the laboratory of Democracy,' she said.

A spokesperson for the designer did not say how much the suit cost, but the bag Clinton was carrying today, not visible in this picture, has a retail value of $2,500

One issue area in which Clinton's views have significantly shifted since the time she was actively involved in politics is the sanctity of marriage.

On Tuesday Clinton said she was 'very, very proud to state that I'm a full supporter of marriage equality right now.'

A little more than a decade ago, Clinton said in an interview on CBS News that like the 'vast majority' of Americans she was against gay marriage. She again affirmed her opposition to same-sex marriage during the Democratic presidential primary in 2007.

After leaving the Obama administration last year, Clinton changed her mind, saying in a video for the Human Rights campaign last March she now believes same-sex couples should be able to marry 'personally and as a matter of policy and law.'

Clinton admitted on Tuesday that she had 'evolved' on the issue over the years, 'In large measure based on the 
experiences that I had with so many people who I knew and cared about.'

'And
 it really became very clear to me that if we're going to support 
marriage in our country, it should be available to everyone regardless 
of who they love and that this marriage equality issue is a great human 
rights issue,' Clinton said.

The hour-long town hall, held at the Newseum in Washington, D.C., is one of the latest 
episodes in Clinton's media blitz to promote her recently released book 
Hard Choices.

Clinton also stopped by Fox News on Tuesday evening for a joint 
interview with Special Report host Bret Baier and On the Record host 
Greta Van Susteren.

Earlier in the day she attended the 2014 Naturalization Ceremony at the National Museum of American History, where designer Ralph Lauren was honored with the James Smithson Bicentennial Medel.

Lauren was saluted at the Smithsonian museum that houses the Star-Spangled banner for donating $13 million to a public-private partnership Clinton founded as the first lady in 1998 to help preserve national treasures like the famous American flag.

Throughout the day Clinton wore a custom Ralph Lauren Collection suit that a spokeswoman for the designer described to Washington Whispers as a cobalt-blue structured silk jacket and pant, 
paired with a silk charmeuse blouse.

The spokeswoman did not say how much Clinton's suit cost, but Whispers columnist Nikki Schwab found that the white Ralph Lauren Collection Soft Ricky Bag that Clinton carried with her on Tuesday had a retail value of $2,500.
