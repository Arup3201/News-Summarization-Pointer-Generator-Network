Unwanted records on the pitch and unseemly scenes off it. QPR headed home from Turf Moor deep in relegation trouble and at odds with their own fans.

This was their 10th straight away defeat in the Premier League. No top-flight team has been that bad on the road for half a century.

Little wonder their supporters’ frustration boiled over at the end and a small group confronted the players as they left the pitch, leading to heated exchanges with Clint Hill and Richard Dunne.

Those incidents will grab the headlines and that is a shame because Burnley were terrific here — much better than the scoreline suggests — en route to a fourth win of the season that sees them replaced in the drop zone by yesterday’s opponents.

They scored twice in the first half through Scott Arfield and Danny Ings either side of a penalty won and converted by Burnley old-boy Charlie Austin and should have added to their lead in a second half they largely dominated.

Arfield’s effort in particular was superb. The winger, who briefly stunned Chelsea here with a cracker in the opening game of the season, does not do ordinary goals.

There appeared to be little danger when the winger collected a throw-in tight on the left-hand touchline in the 12th minute, but he slipped the ball past Mauricio Isla, cut inside Dunne, then curled an inch-perfect shot wide of Robert Green and inside the far post. 

Burnley manager Sean Dyche said: ‘Scotty Arfield’s goal is tremendous, two nutmegs and a great finish. If Alexis Sanchez had scored that it would have been shown a thousand times on TV this weekend. We’ll be lucky to get 15.

‘A lot is made about the energy and desire of the team and the tactical understanding, but we do have some quality and it doesn’t always get a mention.’

Harry Redknapp had a rather different take on it as he bemoaned his team’s defending. 

‘We’ve got three men around their guy,’ he said. 

‘We’re not talking about Lionel Messi are we? He has gone past three of us far too easy.’

Redknapp had sprung a surprise by naming Adel Taarabt in his line-up, tucked in behind Austin. 

It was the Moroccan’s first Premier League start of the season and, perhaps more significantly, his first appearance since falling out with his manager in October after Redknapp had accused him of being ‘three stones overweight’.

However, it was always likely to be Austin who would make an impact against his old club and the striker had already hit the post when he earned the penalty that brought QPR level just after the half-hour. Eduardo Vargas played the ball into the box again and Austin took control of it before guiding the ball away from Jason Shackell. Dean Marney unwisely stepped in with an outstretched leg and his former team-mate did not need any further encouragement to take a clumsy fall.

Andre Marriner made the right decision pointing to the spot but the Burnley fans booed Austin and chanted ‘cheat’ after he got up to rifle the penalty past Tom Heaton for his 14th goal of the season.

Burnley hit back when Ashley Barnes lifted the ball forward for Ings in the 37th minute and Stephen Caulker looked favourite to win possession as it bounced on the edge of his own box. However, Ings touched the ball away from him and turned past Dunne before slipping the ball through the defender’s legs and past Green.

‘A top-drawer goal,’ said Dyche. Again Redknapp disagreed.

‘It’s a shocking second goal, an horrendous one to give away,’ he said. ‘You’ve got to be stronger in that situation. It has cost us dearly.’

Green pulled off a string of fine saves in the second half and when Barnes put the ball in his net it was ruled out for a foul on the former England goalkeeper. No matter. Burnley closed out a win that could prove vital in the survival scrap. For QPR and Redknapp, however, it could have the opposite effect.
