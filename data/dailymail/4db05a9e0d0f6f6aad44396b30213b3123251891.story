A plucky parakeet is lucky to be alive - after being sucked up into her owner's vacuum cleaner.

Birdie thought she'd found the perfect hiding place to lay an egg when she crawled inside her owner Marie Margarone's vacuum cleaner at her home in Milton, Massachusetts, on February 23.

But the eight-year-old ended up being violently drawn up into and thrown around the canister of a hoover after Ms Margarone went to do some spring cleaning and switched on the appliance.

Operation: A plucky parakeet was saved by vets after being sucked into a vacuum cleaner

Dangerous: The bird had crawled inside her owner Marie Margarone's vacuum cleaner at her home in Milton, Massachusetts

With Birdie struggling to survive, a horrified Margarone rushed her to Angell's Animal Medical Center in Boston.

She said: ‘All of a sudden I heard a noise - I looked in where the air comes out and I saw feathers. I shut it off immediately and knew something had terribly gone wrong.

‘I was convinced Birdie wouldn't make it. But she's a member of my family just as my other pets are, and I wanted to do everything I could to help her.’

Badly hurt: Birdie had suffered severe blood loss and a badly fractured wing, of which 25 per cent had to be amputated during a touch-and-go hour-long operation

Vets were shocked to see Birdie had suffered severe blood loss and a badly fractured wing, of which 25 per cent had to be amputated during a touch-and-go hour-long operation.

But, after making an astounding recovery, the battered bird returned home almost a week later.

Ms Margarone said her pet could no longer fly, but was just relieved she had survived.

She added: ‘I'm thrilled to have her back in our home where she belongs, and obviously we'll ensure she stays well clear of the vacuum from here on out.’

Thankful: The poor parakeet can't fly anymore, but its owner is just glad she is alive
