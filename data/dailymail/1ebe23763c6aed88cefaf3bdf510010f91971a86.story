A baby has survived a harrowing start to life after his mother gave birth to him on a train toilet and he fell through the hole onto the tracks.

The 22-year-old woman fainted in the tiny toilet cubicle on Monday after giving birth on the train, which had briefly halted before reaching Hanumangarh station in western Rajasthan state.

'The woman felt acute labour pain, so she went to the toilet to relieve herself and gave birth to a baby boy who slipped down through the toilet bowl and fell on the tracks,' Subhash Vishnoi, senior railway police official, said.

Most Indian trains have western-style and squat toilets with filthy chutes that empty directly onto the tracks.

The train had already left for Hanumangarh by the time the woman's family members found her unconscious in the toilet.

A local guard spotted the newborn crying on the tracks and informed the police, who admitted the baby to a nearby hospital.

'When the woman and her husband found their newborn alive and safe, they were very happy,' police official Ram Singh said.

'They had not expected that the newborn would be alive.'

A railway spokesman said once the train reached its destination, the mother was taken to Hanumangarh hospital, BBC Hindi reported.

He added: 'After being rescued, the baby was initially taken to the local hospital where he was given first aid. He was also later shifted to the town hospital.'

The hospital's chief medical officer, Dr SP Rohilla, confirmed both the mother and baby were doing fine. The baby had no serious injuries, although he was born underweight.
