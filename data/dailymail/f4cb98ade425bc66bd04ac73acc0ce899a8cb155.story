Hackers can harass users of a smart toilets in Japan by exploiting the power of a free Bluetooth app.

The advanced 'Satis' automatic toilet can be remotely operated by a free app available on Android smartphones that lets people raise and lower the toilet set as well as trigger a bidet function and flush.

The unlikely Bluetooth security vulnerability warning came from IT security firm Trustwave, which said the high-end Satis toilet can be operated remotely.

It is not thought that many people are taking advantage of the security glitch or are intent on causing commode chaos across Japan.

The high-end toilet, which has numerous hygienic features including deodorising capabilities, an automatic seat and bidet, is made by Laxil, one of Japan's biggest toilet companies,The Atlantic reported.

The company says its Satis toilet 'defines toilet innovation' as not only do they host a wide array of features, they can be operated by using a mobile phone - which may or may not be hygienic depending on your perspective.

By using an Android app called 'My Satis' over a Bluetooth connection, users can raise and lower the lid, operate a bidet function and flush the toilet.

While this might perhaps seem like a good idea, a pin for the Bluetooth app is set at '0000' and can therefore be used by anyone - even remotely.

Trustwave therefore believes that this could leave toilet users open to attacks by mischievous technophiles.

The security firm said: 'As such, any person using the 'My Satis' application can control any Satis toilet.

'An attacker could simply download the 
'My Satis' application and use it to cause the toilet to repeatedly 
flush, raising the water usage and therefore utility cost to its owner

'Attackers could cause the unit to 
unexpectedly open/close the lid, [or] activate bidet or air-dry 
functions, causing discomfort or distress to user.'
