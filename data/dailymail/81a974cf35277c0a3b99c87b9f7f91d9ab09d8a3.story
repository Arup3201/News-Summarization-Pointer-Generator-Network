Ronnie O'Sullivan and his six-year-old son were left 'shaken' after they were involved in a car crash just hours after O'Sullivan lost the World Championship final to Mark Selby.

The 38-year-old was driving back to his home in Chigwell, Essex from Sheffield at around 1.30am on Tuesday morning when his two-seater sports car spun out of control on the M1.

The car is understood to have hit a patch of standing water at Junction 21 before colliding with the central reservation.

Shock: O'Sullivan's son, Ronnie Jnr, was also in the car when it crashed in the early hours of Tuesday

O'Sullivan and his son, Ronnie Jnr, were able to escape from the wreckage and did not require hospital treatment but the car was not fit to be driven away.

Earlier, five-time world champion O'Sullivan lost 18-14 to Selby having at one stage led 10-5 in what was a dramatic final.

'The match was more about safety,' O'Sullivan said in the wake of defeat. 'He out-fought, me out-battled me, out-done me.

'He had me in all sorts of trouble for two days. In the end I went numb. I tried my hardest, but he was too tough, too hard.'

Police were unable to confirm whether it had been Mr O'Sullivan involved in the crash, but said that officers had attended an incident on the south bound stretch of the motorway early this morning.

'We did have a road traffic collision on the M1 south bound at about 1.30 in the morning, there was an adult and a child in that vehicle,' a police spokesman told MailOnline.

The spokesman added that no one was injured in the collision, which involved just one vehicle - an Audi R8.
