The body of a woman has been found in the wreckage of ferry that sunk off the coast of South Korea six months ago.

This is the first body to be found in three months, increasing the official death toll in the  Sewol ferry disaster  to 295, officials said.

The Sewol ferry capsized and sank some 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon, South Korea, during a routine voyage on April 16.

Searches of the ferry wreckage have been ongoing since the disaster, and nine people are still missing.

The body found on Tuesday was discovered around a women's toilet on the sunken ship, a government taskforce said.

The badly decayed body was being pulled up to the surface and DNA tests were planned to identify the victim, according to task force officials.   

South Korean
prosecutors on Monday sought the death penalty for the captain of the ferry, Lee Joon-seok, 68.

Lee has been charged with homicide, should be
sentenced to death for failing to carry out his duty, which in
effect amounted to homicide, the prosecution told the court yesterday.

The trial has taken place amid intense public anger after  evidence surfaced
that the mostly teenage passengers waited in their cabins,
obediently following orders, as the crew escaped.

Lee was among 15 accused of abandoning the sharply listing
ferry. Four, including the captain, face homicide charges.

The rest face lesser charges, including negligence. A
three-judge panel is expected to announce its verdicts in
November. No formal pleas have been made but Lee has denied
intent to kill.

'Lee supplied the cause of the sinking of the Sewol ... he
has the heaviest responsibility for the accident,' the lead
prosecutor in the case, Park Jae-eok, told the court in the
south of the country.

'We ask that the court sentence him to death.'

The prosecutors sought life sentences for the other three
charged with homicide and prison terms ranging from 15 to 30
years for the rest.

The Sewol capsized and sank some 12 miles off the island of Byungpoongon, South Korea, during a routine voyage on April 16,
triggering an outpouring of nationwide grief and sharp criticism
of the government of President Park Geun-hye for its handling of
the rescue operation.

The crew on trial have said they thought it was the coast
guard's job to evacuate passengers. Video footage of their
escape triggered outrage, especially after survivors testified
they repeatedly told passengers to stay put.

After the prosecution rested its case, Lee apologised to the
families of the victims, saying he never intended to harm
anyone.

'I will repent until the day I die and ask for the victims'
families' forgiveness,' he said. 'I swear with my hand over my
heart, I did not intend to kill anyone. I never even thought of
such a thing.'

Most of the crew were represented by state-appointed
lawyers, who argued that the defendants were mostly too badly
trained to handle the disaster.

Some family members of victims who attended Monday's hearing
had called for the death penalty, but Amnesty International said
death was not the answer.
