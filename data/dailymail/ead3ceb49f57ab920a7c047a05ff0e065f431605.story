Fox News anchor Bret Baier is to take a short break from TV as his six-year-old son undergoes heart surgery.

It is the third time Baier's son Paul has had major surgery after being born with five congenital heart defects.

While Paul recovers from the latest surgery, which was expected to take more than five hours on Thursday, Baier has taken time off work to be by his bedside.

Baier updated viewers about his son's impending surgery via his blog and Twitter, where he praised his son's spirit, saying: 'You'd never know he's been through what he's been through.'

When Paul was born he had been given a clean of health, but just a few hours later it was discovered that he had a rare condition that meant his heart was pumping the wrong way, starving him of oxygen.

Although he has had several surgeries to correct the defects, Baier used his Fox News blog to update viewers on the latest development, Huffington Post reported.

He said the operation, scheduled to start at 8.30am on Thursday at the Children's National Medical Center, was the first major surgery for Paul in more than five years.

'It's not easy, but we're going to plow through this,' Baier said, praising his young son's fighting spirit.

He posted a picture of Paul having a pre-op X-ray yesterday, describing him as a 'champ' as the youngster followed instructions from medical staff.

At around lunchtime, the father of two tweeted another update saying: 'Paul just came off bypass (the heart and lung machine). They're sewing him up - so far so good.'

Baier has spoken openly about his son's health issues in the past, telling Parents.com: 'It's daunting, and nothing like you've ever experienced as a parent, having to explain to your son why this is happening and assuring him that it's going to be OK.'

He said his son shows no outward signs of having heart problems, and added: 'If you looked at the playground, you would never be able to point at him as the kid who has had two open-heart surgeries and four angioplasties.'

The Fox News journalist added that Paul's heart problems had given the family a new perspective, adding: 'Taking the small things, the little laughter every day, right now kind of gets us through to the next stop.'

Baier, who hopes to be back on his 
Special Report news slot next week, visited his son's kindergarten with 
the cardiologist to explain to Paul's classmates what would happen.

He said his son was upbeat about the surgery, answering his friends' questions and showing off scars from previous operations.

He
had his first major open heart surgery, lasting more than eight hours, 
when he was just 12 days old, to replace an aorta in his heart valve.

The operation was repeated again before his first birthday, as the valve does not grow along with the child it is fitted in.
