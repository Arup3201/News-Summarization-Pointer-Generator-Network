Niki Lauda's panegyric on Lewis Hamilton in the minutes after the Spanish Grand Prix was a classic of its kind.

'Lewis Hamilton is unbeatable,' said the Mercedes chairman, dogmatically. 'It's very simple. He's getting better and better every race. He makes no bloody mistake whatsoever. He knows what he's doing. He's got a strong personality. He's focused.

'Nico tried every trick today to get him. And he did a good job, but he couldn't pass him.'

Gap: Hamilton holds off Nico Rosberg in Spain

Even if you cavil about Lewis being 'unbeatable', the thrust of Lauda's argument cannot be denied.

His comments could be taken as Rosberg being told by his boss that he is unfavoured by the team. I am not so sure.

If Rosberg were to beat Lewis repeatedly, Lauda would be just as glowing in his appreciation of the German. That is the Lauda way. Everything is full-throttle.

We should also remember that there is an instinctive desire among some high-ups at Mercedes to produce a Teutonic champion. That is why they sought to jettison Jenson Button when they bought the team from Ross Brawn at the end of the 2009 season. His departure made way for them to bring Michael Schumacher out of retirement to partner Rosberg.

Rosberg's problem is not that he is being treated as a second-class citizen but that, by small margins in the most demanding of circumstances, he is driving like one.

The launch this week of Formula E, the electronic series that will race in 10 cities around the world from September, has shown it has one advantage over Formula One: it can be unashamed about its 'green' agenda.

Organisers admit it will barely make more noise than rustling paper. Formula One, meanwhile, tried to raise the volume by (unsuccessfully) testing a megaphone in Barcelona this week.

Some, including Bernie Ecclestone, say the lack of noise is a turn-off; others, led by Ecclestone's old mucker and former FIA president Max Mosley, say the muted engines are positive because they are ear and family friendly.

Formula E accepts that the fastest their cars will go is 135mph. They also acknowledge that their batteries – a technology that is developing slowly – will not last the race distance. So drivers will get out of one car and into another after 35 minutes.

On the other hand, Formula One frets that some of its cars are slower than some GP cars despite going above 200mph.

This reveals several things. Formula E, being new, can escape without a public outcry for shortcomings that would see Formula One, the world's premier series, not only scrutinised minutely but lampooned.

It also shows that Formula E knows its own mind. It is not burdened by its past. It can merrily fill a niche without worrying about its broader role in the motor-racing firmament.

That freedom is something that Formula One – confused and torn – can only envy.

My two most mesmerising annual experiences at trackside were, first, standing in the tunnel at Monaco as the cars roared through and, secondly, watching them dance through the swimming pool complex just down the road.

The first shook your entire body from toes to brain. It was so loud that one Guardian journalist partly lost his hearing.

The noise level will obviously not be the same this year given the new, quieter engines.

But what about the second experience? Will the cars look so brutish yet still light on their feet? Will they still brake and accelerate at a speed you cannot find anywhere else in motor racing?  I shall report from the pit lane on my findings.

Eric Boullier, McLaren's de facto team principal, hosted a private dinner for a few of us hacks in Barcelona last weekend. What precisely was said remains off the record.

However, I can report perhaps the most important factor in his attempt to restore the team's fortunes: he has a sharp and perceptive mind. He has detected what was wrong and how to put it right. We wish him well. It is a big job.

My colleague Simon Heffer is not a visitor to the paddock. That may explain why on page 187 of his excellent book Simply English, An A to Z of Avoidable Errors there is no entry between 'Islamic and Islamist' and 'It is obvious that'.

The word I would have included is 'Issue'. It is misused by Formula One drivers and teams as a synonym (or is it a euphemism?) for 'problem', as in: 'We had a fuel/tyre/overheating issue today.'

I imagine Simon would share my distaste for another phrase prevalent in Formula One: 'for sure', the filler used by drivers during their press conferences in such sentences as: 'For sure, we will try our best.'

Fernando Alonso, I seem to recall, was a pioneer of this usage. I propose that the FIA introduce the equivalent of a swear box to deal with these linguistic failings.

Guilty party: Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is prone to using the phrase, 'for sure', during a race weekend

One Show presenter Chris Evans, a motor-racing enthusiast, was in Monaco this week to buy the original 1974 Hesketh, one of only three cars in the 308 and 308B series.

James Hunt's son Freddie, who has returned from living in Argentina to restart his track career in endruance racing, said he was 'very glad' Evans had added his father's old car to his extensive collection. He paid £230,000 for the privilege.
