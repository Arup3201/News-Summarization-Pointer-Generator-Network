Peter Sharp told the commuters on a Perth train that he did not want money, but rather just to 'spread a little bit of happiness'

He then played James Brown's hit I Got You and broke out into dance inside the train carriage 

'I don't want money, I just want to spread a little bit of happiness, so I'm going to do that today by starting a small dance party,' Mr Sharp told the carriage of people.

'I'm doing this because we are all amazing individuals and we all have a story to tell, we all have something to share, so as a way of breaking that ice I'm going to start a small dance party.

'If you want to join, you're more than welcome. If you just want to watch or clap, that's also equally OK.' 

Dressed in a suit and bow tie, Mr Sharp instantly launched into his dance routine while James Brown's hit, I Got You, blared through the speakers. 

Shaking his backside and pumping his fists to the song's beat, it wasn't long until a few of the travellers began clapping along

Shaking his backside and pumping his fists to the song's beat, it wasn't long until a few of the travellers began clapping along. 

One by one, the commuters on the train stood up spontaneously to show off their moves and join Mr Sharp in his mindless dancing.

While a few people still looked on warily and some even shook their heads in disbelief, the majority of the passengers were eventually moving and grooving to the tune.

Mr Sharp explained that he began the train dance parties in order to turn 'fear based public spaces into love based public spaces'

Even as the train pulled into the next station to pick up another group of travellers, each person entered with a swing in their step in continuation of the dance party.

In an earlier video, Mr Sharp explained that he began the train dance parties in order to turn 'fear based public spaces into love based public spaces'.

'On the train, it's like this crazy void in space and time where people just disconnect from life and the opportunities that are sitting right next to them,' Mr Sharp said, adding that he hoped to change this attitude through the 'joyous movements of dance and play'.
