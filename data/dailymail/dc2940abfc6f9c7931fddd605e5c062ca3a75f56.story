Attack: Yuriy Kozak, 45, was stabbed at a flat in Salford, Greater Manchester and died later in hospital

A man has been charged with the murder of a music teacher who was stabbed to death on New Year's Day.

Ukrainian national Yuriy Kozak, 46, was stabbed in the neck at a flat in Salford, Greater Manchester, and died later in hospital.

Andrij Senechko, 46, of no fixed 
address, is accused of Mr Kozak’s murder and will appear before 
magistrates in Manchester tomorrow.

Greater Manchester Police said a 
45-year-old man also arrested in connection with the death has been 
released on bail on suspicion of assisting an offender.

Businessman Mr Kozak moved to Britain nine years ago and taught music to children at the Ukrainian Saturday School in Manchester.

He was knifed after a fight apparently broke out at the flat shortly after 4.30pm.

Paramedics alerted by a 999 call arrived to find Mr Kozak with fatal wounds.

They took him to hospital but he died shortly afterwards

It is believed the alleged attack occurred at a top floor flat which had been rented out to two young women.

Mr Kozak taught music to children at a Saturday school in his native homeland before settling in the UK in 2003.

The former company director, who helped run a civil engineering firm, lived in Prestwich, Manchester with his 41-year old wife Helen. It is not known why he was at the murder scene.

In a statement Mrs Kozak, 41, said: 'Yuriy was a loving husband, father and brother to us all. He loved his family and was a real home-body.

'Yuriy was born in the Ukraine but moved to Britain nine years ago and he was much loved by his local community.

'He used to be a music teacher in the Ukraine and taught children music at the Ukrainian Saturday School. He loved children and music was his passion.

'He played the piano and the guitar from a young age.

'Yuriy had a good sense of humour and he was always happy and smiling. He was always joyful and liked to make people happy. He had many friends and was very popular in the community.

'If anyone knows of any information that could help the police with their investigation into Yuriy's death, please contact them. We respectfully ask to be left in peace to grieve at our loss of Yuriy.'

Kate Parkinson, 64, who lives in a council flat two storeys below the scene, said: 'We went out New Year's Eve to our local club and at around 2am we came home.

'There was nothing going on and we hadn't heard any noise like a party going on. We went to bed and were up pretty early.

'The next day in the late afternoon I heard lots of talking outside and I pulled the curtains and police were everywhere, they told us 'go inside' and we did and locked the doors. I thought at first there was a madman on the loose.

'Then the police came round at 8pm asking if we'd heard anything. The flat was rented out to two foreign girls. I think they are Polish. I'm not sure how long they have been there.

'I can only assume that a fight has broken out. The girls were stood outside in their housecoats and nighties crying. They are probably in their thirties and as far as I know there is just them living there.

'Someone said they had been trying to resuscitate the man in the house. There had been lots of blood on the stairs. Someone has lost their life probably for a silly argument.'

Gladys Tracey, 82, said: 'I was lying in bed and all of a sudden I could see blue lights coming through my curtains and the sirens were screaming out.

'Yuriy had a good sense of humour and
he was always happy and smiling. He was always joyful and liked to make
people happy. He had many friends and was very popular in the 
community.'

'There was probably about seven cars and a dozen officers. At first I thought it might have been a drug raid because they were all charging in and shouting at the top of their voices.

'They all raced to the top floor and brought the man down on a stretcher before they raced away again.

'It's usually quite a quiet block and we rarely get any trouble so to have something like this happen on your doorstep is a big shock.'

Supt Stuart Barton of Greater Manchester Police said: 'This will clearly be a very distressing incident for both the man's family and the wider community.

'We understand everyone's concern and this is why we have now launched an investigation, led by experienced detectives, to establish exactly what has happened.

'We have made two quick arrests and I want to reassure people that we don't believe there was a wider threat to other people in the community.

'Residents will be able to see more officers than usual in the area and I would urge anyone with concerns or questions to approach them - they will be happy to help.

'I also want to appeal to anyone with information to call us.'
