The real name of a 4-year-old girl who was murdered more than 20 years ago but not identified until this year finally has been etched into her tombstone after the girl was known simply as 'Baby Hope' for the last two decades. 

The body of little Anjelica Castillo has been buried in St. Raymond's Cemetery in the Bronx since it was found in a cooler on the side of a highway in New York City's Washington Heights in 1991. Detectives working the case of the then-unidentified body gave the girl the name 'Baby Hope' as they vowed to catch her killer.

At a ceremony at the grave site on Friday, Castillo's mother and other family members left flowers and lit candles for the girl, who would now be 26 years old.

Blessing: dozens of people - including police who investigated the case for years - showed up to bless the newly engraved tombstone

'I'm just glad that her name is on her stone,' the girl's sister, Lorena Castillo, told NBC New York.

Father Rudy Gonzalez, who presided over the ceremony, blessed the grave site, telling mourners, 'Bless the engraving of Anjelica's name and bless any child who at this moment may be suffering at the hands of evil hearts.'

When Castillo's body was found 22 years ago, detectives determined the girl had been sexually assaulted and suffocated before being put in a cooler and dumped on the side of a highway.

'We couldn't imagine how anybody could be so cruel to such an innocent little child,' retired detective Jerry Giorgio said.

For years, Girogio and retired deputy chief Joseph Resnick work feverishly to find 'Baby Hope's' killer, but the case eventually went cold.

But authorities never forgot about 'Baby Hope.'

In July, the NYPD relaunched its investigation into the girl's murder on the 22nd anniversary of they day her body was found.

Never forgotten: Police reopened the 'Baby Hope' case this year, which led to the discovery of the girl's identity - and her alleged killer

Authorities canvassed the Washington Heights neighborhood with flyers with a sketch of 'Baby hope' in the hopes that it would turn up new leads.

And it did.

The day after authorities reopened the case, a call came into Crime Stoppers - the NYPD's tip line - from a person who claimed to have information about the case.

The caller 'gave specific family members, where to look -- ethnicity, origin, approximate dates of birth, and she turned out to be right,' Detective Elena Donnell said.

That tip led to the arrest of 52-year-old Conrado Juarez, a cousin on Anjelica's father's side.

Juarez confessed to the murder, but later recanted, saying the confession had been coerced. 

After admitting to the murder, Juarez gave a jailhouse interview to the New York Times claiming that he didn't actually kill the girl, but he did help dispose of the body.

Juarez told the paper that Anjelica and her sister, Maribel, were the children of his uncle and they had been living with him and his sister in their Astoria, Queens, apartment.

One day, the girls' father never came home, and Juarez said he and his sister - who has since died - were then tasked with caring for the girls.

Monster: Authorities say Castillo's cousin Conrado Juarez sexually assaulted her before suffocating her and leaving her body on the side of a highway

'Like garbage': Castillo's body was found dumped on the side of a highway inside a cooler

'I told my sister: ‘'You should get some kind of receipt,’” Juárez said. 'Even if it’s not notarized or formally prepared by a lawyer, get the real mother to sign something. You are going to be the one raising those girls.’

Juarez claims his sister called him one day on his cell phone and told him that Anjelica had fallen down the stairs and that she needed help getting rid of the body.

As the Times notes, fewer than three-percent of Americans had cell phones in 1992 - when the alleged murder was committed - and the probability of a poor, immigrant kitchen worker being amongst those with a cell phone is beyond slim, so his account doesn't seem to add up.

In his confession, however, authorities say Juarez admitted to things that only the killer would know. Despite his recanting the confession, prosecutors contend that Juarez sexually assaulted the girl in his apartment and then smother her with a pillow when she wouldn't stop crying. He then stuffed her lifeless body into a cooler, took a cab to Washington Heights and dumped the body on the side of the highway.

Juarez has since been charged with murder in the girl's death. His next court appearance is scheduled for November 21.
