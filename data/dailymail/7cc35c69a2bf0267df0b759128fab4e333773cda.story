An agent at one of America's biggest sports agencies is accused of using a porn star to help him recruit new players for his agency.

Porn star Bibi Jones claimed in an 
interview that she used to accompany Gaylord Sports Management agent Terry Bross to bars where
 he would talk to baseball players that he was hoping to sign.

She says she slept with at least 10 of the 
baseball players that they met over the course of a year, and a number 
of those subsequently signed with Mr Bross and his agency.

Making connections: GSM vice president Terry Bross supposedly brought a porn star to bars to lure clients

While none of the 10 men that Ms 
Jones slept with said that the sole reason they signed with the company 
was because of Ms Jones, the connection does appear to be a close one.

Dan
 Uggla, a player for the Atlanta Braves, signed with GSM just three 
weeks after he was in Phoenix, Arizona, where Ms Jones and Mr Bross 
would go out together to meet prospective players. 

In an interview with Business 
Insider, Ms Jones, who has starred in films such as Naughty Nannies 3 and 
Amateur Action, said that she was never forced to have sex with the 
players and she never received any money for doing so. It was just for 
fun.

'I was willing to do 
it,' she said. 'It wasn't even expected for me to hook up with these 
guys. It was just like I was arm candy for him.'

This
 is not the first string of bad press for Ms Jones, as she caused a 
firestorm for New England Patriots football player Rob Gronkowski after 
posing in his jersey next to a shirtless Gronkowski.

The pair said that nothing sexual happened between the two of them, and the photo was just a stunt in an effort to earn the football player more Twitter followers. 

While the photo caused problems for Mr 
Gronkowski with fans, sports fans are now questioning whether it is 
right for agents to attempt to lure potential clients into business 
using porn stars.

News of the alleged partnership between Bross, who is the vice president of the baseball division of GSM, and Ms Jones is not helping matters for GSM either.

In July, a GSM agent named Jason Dubin, 31, was arrested for using the internet to lure two teenage girls to have sex with him.

Charged: Jason Dubin was arrested on two counts of luring a minor

Dubin had been communicating with what he thought were two girls named 'Christie,' who said she was 17, and her supposedly 14-year-old neighbour 'Brittany'. Both were undercover police officers.

Dubin talked to the two girls over a social media site called MocoSpace.com and they spoke about sex, his preferences for oral sex, and how he wanted to 'teach her a few things'.

When he showed up to 'Christie's' house after being told that her parents would not be home, he was promptly arrested on two counts of aggravated luring of a minor.

It is unclear which athletes Dubin represents, but he reportedly boasted about his position to police while he was held in custody.
