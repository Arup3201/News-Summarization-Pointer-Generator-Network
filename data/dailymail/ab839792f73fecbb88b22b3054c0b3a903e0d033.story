Ever got annoyed with your neighbour and decided to hash it out in the middle of the street? Well two cranky kangaroos did.

In a suburban street on the  Central Coast in NSW, two male roos have been captured slogging it out in an epic brawl that lasted several minutes.

The five minute video resembles something from a boxing or martial arts street fight, with the two large animals kicking and punching each other repeatedly.

There's plenty of skill involved in the battle where both kangaroos are seen balancing on their tails and kicking each other with great force.

The roos are also seen wrestling and grabbing one another viciously in a bid to be the dominant male.

A sight that is rarely seen on residential streets, music has also been added to the video of the wild kangaroo street fight to depict the event as rather comical.

Mostly staged in the middle of the street, the gruelling battle is also taken onto the front lawn of one property as the pair continue to hash it out.

Boxing match anyone?? Two kangaroos caused a spectacle in a suburban street on the NSW Central Coast in an epic street fight

Kangaroos have powerful back legs which they use for leaping, combined with a long muscular tail for balance. 

Both male and female kangaroos will fight in various circumstances, but long, ritualised fighting or 'boxing' is usually left to the male roos.
