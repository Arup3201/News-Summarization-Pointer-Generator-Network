Within the next decade, the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts, no more channels, and no more menus.

That’s according to Netflix’s chief product officer Neil Hunt who made the statements at the Internet Week event in New York.

He predicts that by ‘2025 or sooner’ services such as his own, will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in.

Netflix's chief product officer Neil Hunt predicts that within the next decade, grid-style menus of titles will be replaced by highly personalised choices, including guessing what viewers will want before they sign in. Hunt also claims standard channels will be replaced by a 'different channel' for each of its 50 million subscribers

In April, Netflix signed a deal with three small cable-providers in the U.S. to become a regular TV channel.

The agreements with Atlantic Broadband, RCN Telecom Services and Grande Communications gives the internet streaming site's subscription service a channel on TiVo boxes that the companies provide their customers.

It debuted on Atlantic and RCN before expanding on to Grande's service at the end of April.

And everyone will get their own, dedicated channel.

‘Our vision is, you won’t see a grid and you won’t see a sea of titles,’ said Hunt.

Instead, Netflix will show viewers up to four TV shows or films it thinks they will want to watch, based on previous shows, the time of day, the day of the week, and more.

By linking to social networks, Netflix could even learn a viewer’s mood based on their most recent posts, or suggest films following a change in relationship status.

However, this is still a little way off as Netflix's CEO Reed Hastings admitted at today's Recode Conference that only 'a few people' are sharing Netflix views on Facebook, but 'auto-sharing hasn’t yet panned out.'

In terms of channels, Hunt believes that as personalisation improves, fewer people will watch standard channels created by networks.

Instead, each Netflix subscriber - which at the end of April was approaching 50 million - would be served an individual channel, built specifically for them.

Hunt also said that adverts could be ditched completely following customer feedback, and brands would need to find alternative methods to promote their goods.

Alternatively, there could be fewer, but more personalised and targeted adverts that generate the best conversion.

When asked about the controversial topic of internet fast lanes for web traffic, Hunt said Netflix was in support of net neutrality.

He added Netflix should be the leading provider because it offers the best service, not because it can afford to pay for faster access.

At today's event, Hastings said net neutrality wouldn’t be an issue if cable companies had competition for internet in the home.

Until 2010, AT&T and Verizon invested tens of billions of dollars to compete with cable, but ended the project when they admitted they couldn't compete.

Hastings added he is concerned cable operators will begin raising the prices for services such as Netflix, and this could impact on the prices they charge.
