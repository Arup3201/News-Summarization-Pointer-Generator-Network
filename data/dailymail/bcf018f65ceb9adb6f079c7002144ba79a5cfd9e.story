Health and Safety in the workplace began with an illustrated magazine for workers on the railways 100 years ago this month, according to a historian.

The magazine paved the way for today's health and safety laws, said Dr Mike Esbester, of the University of Portsmouth.

The feature attempts to inform workers for Great Western Railway of the dangers they face in August 1913.

Modern attempts to inform workers of the dangers they could face at work began with this illustrated magazine published in 1913

The railway workers were reminded to carry out their work as safely as possible, whether crossing the railway line, wearing goggles to protect their eyes or loading and unloading goods.

Having studied the evolution of health and safety messages over a century, Dr Esbester says that the country has seen enormous changes in the way we have been 'taught, cajoled, encouraged and warned' by the authorities to safeguard ourselves.

He said: 'Before 1913, safety warnings to workers were very top-down and text heavy.

'August 1913 saw an entirely different tone and style, it was a massive change.

The railway workers were reminded to carry out their work as safely as possible, whether crossing the railway line, wearing goggles to protect their eyes or loading and unloading goods

'It spoke "man-to-man", using an informal, conversational tone and showed people how to be safe rather than just telling them what to do.'

He said that initially the focus was on workplace safety, but from 1916 road safety was an increasing concern.

In the 1920s thousands of people were being killed on the roads each year, and tens of thousands injured.

Reducing the toll of mass motorised transport became a pressing issue.

Health and safety moved into the home in the 1930s in response to more people dying and being injured in incidents at home than on the roads or at work.

Dr Mike Esbester discovered the magazine which informed workers at Great Western Railway how to be safe in their jobs

Common causes of death or injury in the home were burns, trips, falls and drowning.

Over the past 100 years health and safety messages have appeared on a wide selection of items, from children's handkerchiefs, beer mats, milk bottle tops, cigarette cards - which were highly coveted and collectable - and Christmas wrapping paper, to the more commonly known films, posters, leaflets and booklets.

Dr Esbester became an expert in the subject after he came across the Great Western Railway feature whilst researching railway history.

It included a single black and white photograph of multiple pairs of goggles which had been smashed while protecting their wearers' eyes from flying shards of metal.

Similar illustrated articles were carried in the following months.

He said: 'I'd never seen anything like it before, and wondered what made this a turning point - why then and there?

'It turned out the magazine feature was a response to the threat of new laws.

'The railway companies didn't want the state to tell them what to do. They were famously opposed to any new government powers, so they were trying to head off more regulation by introducing changes themselves.

'Their message was "it's up to you, as the worker, to look after yourself".'
