For Il Divo star Sébastien Izambard, standing on stage at the famed Marquis Theatre on Broadway was a momentous occasion.

Indeed, for the entire group, it was a dream come true as they debuted their new show A Musical Affair last week.

What was once a ‘popera’ act created by Simon Cowell -  which as bandmate David Miller admits no-one believed would last longer than two years - had now reached this pinnacle, spanning 10 years and selling more than 26 million albums worldwide.

But for French-born Sébastien especially, the work has been grueling as he has strives to juggle Il Divo and his growing family – jetting home to see his wife and three young children between shows around the globe.

And for the first time, Sébastien, 40, reveals just why it’s so important to him to make sure he spends as much time as possible with his beloved wife Renee, and their five-year-old twins Luca and Rose and two-year-old son Jude.

When he was just six, the dashing Parisian’s father Maurice left him and his mother Marie, then only 24.

And in an exclusive interview today, Sébastien tells MailOnline: ‘I had a difficult childhood, I didn’t have very present parents because they separated early and my mum had to keep everything together and manage a child and work.

‘She was young and she was not very much around, she did the best she could with what she had. But I had to manage myself from an early age, I didn’t have a lot of support, so that’s why I’m really present with my children.’

Once revealing he lived with his mother in a ‘tiny room on top of an apartment block, with an outside toilet and only a sink to wash in’, Sébastien went on to become a pop star in France at 21 after telling how the piano became his ‘therapist’.

Daddy: Sébastien Izambard says Simon Cowell, who created Il Divo, will be a good father to his baby son, adding: 'I think that people you don't expect to be changing nappies suddenly change'

And he is quick to add: ‘I’m very close to my mum now…I don’t see my father - I made a choice, but I feel like I’m good, I’m lucky.’

After meeting his wife Renee in her native Australia where she worked as a publicist for Sony, the couple wed in August 2008.

However, Renee suffered not just one but two difficult pregnancies, battling a host of health problems.

The first culminated in their twins being born three months prematurely by emergency caesarean as Renee developed the condition pre-eclampsia, with dangerously high blood pressure – prompting Sébastien to pull out of an Il Divo tour of Japan as he says: ‘There was no question, it was not easy to understand for the group, but my family will always come first. I could not perform, I had to be by her side.’

For weeks it was not known whether the tiny babies would survive. And during her second labour, with their son Jude, now two, Renee came close to death herself after suffering placental abruption.

As Sébastien told the Mail in 2011:‘It’s been very difficult but it pulled us closer together. We have risked death to be parents.’

Renee has spoken out about her pregnancy battles and Sébastien says: ‘I’m pleased that she spoke about it, pre-eclampsia is the number one death in pregnancy.

‘It’s such a difficult thing and not enough is known. The reality is that we have some friends who’ve gone in and in 10 minutes had a nice delivery, but we had none of that, what we experienced means everything is more precious.

‘It was definitely risky for Renee and the kids, it was really tough.’

Clearly
 proud of his family, Sébastien delights in recounting their recent 
visits to the zoos and museums around Manhattan after Renee and the 
children – whom he says are already musical much to his chagrin, 
sighing: ‘I don’t want them to do what Daddy does, I want to keep them 
at home!’

He adds: ‘Renee was here with the kids for the last two weeks and it was utterly madness, we have five-year-old twins and a two-year-old like a rugby player, he’s like his granddad who’s 6ft 5, so it was challenging.’

But, he reveals that during the visit: ‘We talked about having a fourth one when we settle, probably in California, next year.

‘We would like to have another one…I’m an only child and I dreamed of having a big family. The problem is finding the right balance between family and work.

‘Renee was in the entertainment industry, she understands the downside of having a husband who comes home and sleeps, but somehow it just works, we manage to find a balance and it seems to be working for now.’

family and work'

As for Mr Cowell, who created Il Divo after having the idea of forming a modern day Three Tenors, Sébastien laughs when asked about the music millionaire’s impending fatherhood.

Cowell’s baby boy with girlfriend Lauren Silverman is due in February and Sébastien says: ‘Everyone wonders what Simon will be like as a father, but I think he’ll be good.

‘I think people that you don’t expect to be changing nappies suddenly change. When you become a dad you change, that’s the way it is, you have this little life relying on you, good and bad.

‘I’m very hands on with my kids. I would be a manny! I would be happy to be at home with my kids, but I can see how challenging it is.’

And indeed, his fellow bandmate, David 
Miller says he and his wife, stunning opera singer Sarah Joy – who 
recently played tragic Anna Nicole Smith in the New York City Opera’s 
production – have decided that ‘right now isn’t the time’ for them to 
become parents.

Married to Sarah Joy since 2009, David, 40, tells MailOnline: ‘We talk about it a lot, we look at Sebastian – but the children would have to be travelling or they would have to be raised by a nanny and that’s not something either of us want. We’re both very emotional people and very attached to the people in our lives.

‘It wouldn’t be fair, one of our careers would have to give.’

Along with their fellow bandmates, 
Spanish baritone Carlos Marín, Swiss tenor Urs Bühler, Sébastien and 
David will now tour America and Canada with A Musical Affair following 
their six-night run on Broadway. This will be followed by a worldwide tour from next September.

Sébastien
 says: ‘The show’s going great, it’s wonderful to be in one place and 
it’s very refreshing to sing a new repertoire rather than having to sing
 Unbreak My Heart for the 30,000th time! The songs are beautiful.’

With David being the last member to be signed to Il Divo in December 2003 following a worldwide two-year search, Sébastien admits: ‘It’s a miracle in terms of what happened for the four of us.

‘We don’t seem to be a band that seems to rest! In terms of recording, Simon is able to trust us, we’re really independent and we’re grown up – and he’s going to have a lot to deal with!’

David adds: ‘Il Divo has had a much longer life than any of us thought it would – it’s gone on about eight years longer than anyone – the group, Simon, our management – thought it would. No-one could have predicted our global success.

‘We didn’t expect to get to this point, I would love to see Il Divo continue as long as people still enjoy what we do.’
