A controversial U.S website that allows people who need a kidney to plead directly for a donor online is launching in the UK.

The NHS runs an anonymous scheme so that altruistic donors are not informed who ends up getting their kidney.  It is given to the person who is judged by a medical panel to most need it and who will benefit most from it. 

However, under the American scheme users who sign up to the website MatchingDonors can watch personal appeals and read about their background before deciding who they would like to donate to.

Many needy recipients upload videos of themselves perhaps playing the guitar, while others feature their children asking viewers to help make their parents better.

Potential donors can also get in touch with the patient via a messaging service. Once a person decides they would like to donate their kidney they can check to see if they are a blood type match before their suitability is tested further.

The website, based in Boston, has successfully matched around 250 strangers, which is twice as many as the NHS has managed.

Paul Dooley, from MatchingDonors told ITV: 'We have wanted to come to England for the longest time. We have the ability to take our system to the UK and save their lives.'

Rebecca Rogers from Ramsgate has signed up to MatchingDonors because she wants a more personal system.

'I like knowing who I am going to give my kidney to,' she told ITV.

'You don't get that in the UK. You just go to the hospital and they expect you to give it up just like that.'

The website has been criticised by 
doctors who say organ donations should not be decided on the basis of 
who can tell the 'saddest story.'

Mother-of-three Saira Khan has become the first person in the UK to sign up as a patient on the MatchingDonors website

The Human Tissue Authority (HTA), the
UK’s transplant watchdog, carried out a review which found the website 
could charge up to 595 US dollars (£376.77) for patients to sign up.

However, it is made clear on the website that it is illegal to offer or receive payment for the organ.

Allan Marriott-Smith, Director of Strategy and Quality at the HTA said: 'We are not yet clear how it will operate here and the legal implications, and we have not had a conversation with the charity about these issues. Once we have more information, we can advise members of the public considering the possibility of arranging a donation through this route.

'We are acutely aware that organ donation can be an emotive and sensitive subject. It is our role to make sure that living organ donors give consent to the process, and to safeguard against reward being offered or sought for a donation.

'The principle of organ donations, both from living and deceased people, being a freely given gift is the basis of the law in this area. We must give careful consideration to new developments to make sure that they are within these parameters.

'We have seen an increase in the use of social networking websites which can put potential donors in contact with people who need an organ transplant. We are constantly reviewing our approach to keep pace with such developments, to make sure they meet the legal requirements.'

The HTA said they would launch a new framework for the assessment of directed-altruistic donations on September 10.

Patient Saira Khan who needs a kidney has become the first to sign up in the UK. The mother-of-three says she is a 
qualified teacher and would love to return to her job one day.

'I need a new kidney very badly. My kidneys were destroyed through no fault of my own,' she said in her post.

However, she says she is not yet on 
dialysis and is currently controlling her condition with medication. It 
is therefore unlikely that Mrs Khan would be viewed as a 'priority' on 
the NHS transplant list.
