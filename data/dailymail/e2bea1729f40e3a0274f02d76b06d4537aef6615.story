An American tourist has spent the night stranded in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, after she fell 15 metres off a cliff while bushwalking.

The 25-year-old from the US state of Wisconsin was walking near Pulpit Rock, Mount Victoria with a group of friends on Friday when she slipped from a track.

She fell about 15 metres and rolled a further 20 metres down a steep slope, police say.

Rescue crews found the woman suffering a possible broken ankle and broken ribs. 

She remained with an ambulance team overnight due to low light and foggy weather conditions. 

Blue Mountains Police Rescue Sergeant Dallas Atkinson told ABC a helicopter was deployed to finish the rescue this morning.

'After she fell yesterday she was accessed a short time later by police and ambulance,' Sergeant Atkinson said.

'It was determined that she had sustained leg and chest injuries and a rescue plan was put in place where the patient was going to be carried out.

Rescue teams had to wait for the heavy fog to lift so they could winch the woman out via a helicopter

'But due to the terrain in the prevailing weather that plan was aborted.'
