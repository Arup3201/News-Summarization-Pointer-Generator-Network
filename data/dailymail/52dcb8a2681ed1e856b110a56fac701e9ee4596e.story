Sainsbury's has recalled 500g packets of So Organic Sultanas bought over the past five months

Sainsbury's has recalled thousands of bags of sultanas after tests showed some packets were infected with potentially fatal salmonella.

The supermarket giant, which has more than 1,000 stores in the UK, yesterday sent out emails to customers who had bought 500g packets of Sainsbury's Organic Sultanas over the past five months.

Father-of-two Chris Dennis, of Tunbridge Wells, Kent, said he was sent an email by Sainsbury's yesterday after he bought a bag of the affected sultanas earlier this month.

He said: 'If Sainsbury's didn't have my email from online shopping, how would they have known to contact me?

'I have a young daughter and son who adore sultanas and you'd think that by buying organic, you would be doing the best for your children.

'Luckily we hadn't opened the packet yet, so we know we are safe, but what about all the thousands of people who have had them in their cupboards for the past five months and don't know about the salmonella scare?'

The email sent to Mr Dennis, 38, from Sainsbury's reads: 'We understand from our records that you have bought Sainsbury's Organic Sultanas 500g in the last five months.

'During routine testing it has come to our attention that a low level incidence of Salmonella has been found in this product.

'The safety of our customers is extremely important to us and as a precautionary measure, we are asking all customers who have bought this product not to consume it and to return it to their nearest Sainsbury's store where they will receive a full refund.

Anyone can get salmonella, but young children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly have a greater risk of becoming severely ill.

Symptoms include watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever.

These symptoms usually last for four to seven days and clear up without treatment, but if you become seriously ill you may need to be treated for dehydration (fluid loss) caused by the illness.

Transmission occurs by eating contaminated food, mainly of animal origin, or by faecal contamination from an infected person or animal.

'I can confirm that we have removed all the affected products from our stores and no other products are affected in this way.

'If you have any questions please call our Careline on 0800 636 262. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.'

The Public Health England website states: "Anyone can get salmonella, but young children, the elderly and people whose immune systems are not working properly have a greater risk of becoming severely ill.

'Symptoms include watery diarrhoea, stomach cramps and sometimes vomiting and fever.

'These symptoms usually last for four to seven days and clear up without treatment, but if you become seriously ill you may need to be treated for dehydration (fluid loss) caused by the illness.
