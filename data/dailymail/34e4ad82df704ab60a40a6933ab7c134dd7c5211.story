I am creeping through the streets of Compton, one of the most dangerous neighbourhoods in Los Angeles, like a night stalker. Wearing military fatigues and a bullet-proof vest, and brandishing my weapon, I dash behind a tree. There is a helicopter circling overhead, its beam illuminating the neighbourhood.

Suddenly, I spot my target darting behind a huge metal industrial rubbish bin. I approach slowly and as I shine my torch down the narrow gap, I realise I have him cornered.

I can see the whites of his eyes, glowing like orbs in the darkness, as he cowers and trembles in the corner. My target is a brown terrier mongrel. Now I have to catch him and just hope that he doesn’t bite.

So I start yawning and licking my lips as I get closer. I went on an  animal behaviour course and this  is apparently one way to relax a  dog. But as I do it, I feel like a  total maniac.

As I crawl on my hands and knees through smelly litter with a cheeseburger in my mouth, this isn’t what I imagined I would be doing when I moved to Los Angeles four years ago.

I am an animal rescuer. Like a demented Snow White, I will take in any creature great or small that is in  distress or homeless. I  will rehabilitate the creature and then find it a  new home.

From featherless chickens from a butcher to a box of kittens, my home is a revolving door. (Matilda, Gertrude and Fergus the chickens are all living happily on a ranch and their feathers have grown back, I am happy to report).

But rescuing dogs is my greatest passion. At the moment there are four of my own dogs, three foster dogs – a mum and her puppies – plus a mini boa constrictor (found in an air-conditioning vent) co-habiting in my house. I have a big garden, so don’t think I am a hoarder.

I volunteer with a charity called Dogs Without Borders and we save animals from ‘death row’ in the Los Angeles dog pounds, and strays off the street. They are placed in loving foster homes until we find them a perfect ‘forever home’.

Our pack leader is my friend Galit, who started Dogs Without Borders after Hurricane Katrina to help some of the abandoned dogs in New  Orleans. We also rescue dogs from  as far away as Taiwan.

However, most of  are from the Los Angeles area.

About 200 perfectly healthy dogs are euthanised in Los Angeles County every week. And, across the United States, millions are put down each year. About 50 per cent of all  the ‘owner surrenders’ or strays  are pedigrees.

The most common reasons given for dogs being dumped is moving to a house that doesn’t allow pets or, after buying a cute puppy, ‘it got bigger than we thought it would’.

If a stray dog comes in, by law it has to be held for 72 hours to give the owners a chance to be reunited.

However, there is a 90 per cent chance that these dogs will be put to sleep. When the pound does a cull because of overcrowding, the strays are the first to be killed.

The dog pounds, which we visit about three times a week to rescue dogs from death row, are the saddest places I have ever been to. After four years, I still cry when I’m there.

The staff do their best but they are overwhelmed. The dogs are confined to small kennels/runs with about 25 other barking or crying animals, and they have to relieve themselves where they eat and sleep. They are depressed and sad, and cry constantly for the family that abandoned them. They don’t get any attention besides having a bowl of food slid under their kennel door and their waste sprayed out with a high-powered hose.

If the dog is big, black or any of the ‘bully’ breeds (pitbull, rottweiler, mastiff etc), it is pretty much dead when it walks through the door.

The most heartbreaking part is when they are taken to be put down. The dogs get excited when they see the leash, thinking they are going for a walk, and trot off happily, wagging their tails. Until, that is, they get to The Room.

One shelter manager says: ‘Every one of them freaks out and puts on the brakes when we get to the door.

‘It must smell like death or they can feel the sad souls that are left in there. It’s strange, but it happens with every one of them.’ The dog is then restrained and held down by one or two veterinary technicians depending on their size and how freaked out they are.

A euthanasia technician or a vet starts the process. They find a vein in a front leg and inject a lethal dose of the ‘pink stuff’. If the dog panics from being restrained and jerks, the needle can tear out of a leg. ‘I’ve seen needles comes out and I’ve been covered with the resulting blood, and been deafened by the yelps and screams,’ says the manager. ‘They all don’t just go to sleep. Sometimes they spasm for a while, gasp for air and defecate.’

I know this is heartbreaking to any dog lover and I am sorry for being graphic. But on a happier note, there are about 100 animal rescue groups in the Los Angeles area that go into these shelters, take as many animals as possible and then find them loving homes. We are very strict about who can adopt – there’s a process everyone must go through to make sure we match the right dog with the right person.

And we always do a ‘home check’ to make sure that it is a suitable environment. Adopters have to sign a contract, which includes the guarantee that if they ever give up the dog, they return it to us and not to the pound. For me, there is no better feeling than saving a dog from the pound, rehabilitating it and then watching it go to its forever home.

My most recent case was an  emaciated Old English Bulldog, who had given birth to three litters before being dumped on the street by her owners. She ended up at a shelter and when I took her she had only three hours left to live. She had calluses from lying on a cement floor and had chewed the end of her tail off from the stress.

I called her Rosebud because with a lot of love (and food) she blossomed like a rose in the sun. She now lives with a couple who adore her, and they send me photographs of Rosebud, who goes fishing and camping, and lies in the sun snoring.

I have added to my own pack a deaf and blind-in-one-eye dog called Little Moon, who came from a situation that even made the headlines back in the UK – 137 dogs were seized from an animal hoarder.

It is not just America that has a stray dog problem. About 9,000  strays were ‘put to sleep’ in the UK last year, according to the Dogs Trust. The charity found that 111,986 stray and abandoned dogs were picked up by local authority teams  across the UK in the last year – that’s more than 300 every day.

Happily, microchips have saved the lives of more than 8,000 dogs in the past year by reuniting them with their owners.

If your dog isn’t microchipped, I would strongly recommend it.

The device is only the size of a grain of rice and is implanted under the skin. My dogs even have a  GPS tracking device attached to their collars and if any of them escaped or were stolen I could track them with an app on my phone.  Neurotic? Maybe, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

The best thing you could do, of course, is to rescue a dog rather than buy one. Anyone who has a rescue dog knows they are the best type. They always know you have saved them, and they will love you with every fibre of their being.

My first dog was Wally, a lurcher I got from Battersea Dogs Home (which never kills dogs). He was my heart and when he died I thought it was the end of the world. I miss him every day.

If I hadn’t rescued Wally, I would never have ended up in dog rescue. So every one I save partly owes their lives to the love of mine. As the Buddhist saying goes: ‘Hearts are meant to be broken. That is how they open.’

Since Wally, I have fallen in love a hundred more times – and I’ve had my heart broken a thousand more. I have cried into the fur of a lifeless body and witnessed the result of horrific cruelty. But the happiness by far outweighs the sadness.

I am not some sanctimonious do-gooder who has no life outside of dog rescue. I don’t think there is a special place for me in heaven because of what I do.

I just feel blessed that I have found my little niche in life. It compels me and defines me, and makes me happy. Some people think my  passion for animals is sad and I  must be crazy to love my dogs like people love their children.

But just because I didn’t give birth to them, doesn’t mean I should love them less. I don’t really give a fig what those people think. People who love dogs are my kind of people. We are from the same tribe. If you don’t like dogs, then the chances are that I won’t like you.

I definitely wouldn’t date you. It’s a deal-breaker. But then you wouldn’t want to date me either – and would be horrified with sharing the bed with three dogs.
