A super slim vet saved a sheepdog stuck in a rocky crevice after mountain rescuers were too big to reach him.

Slightly-built Kes Taylor, 35, was brought in to wriggle down the tiny gap to reach the collie dog, Chip, stuck 82ft underground.

Kes was the smallest volunteer in the desperate operation to rescue Chip who had been trapped in the crevice for two days.

Unhurt: Chip was eventually brought up two days after he fell in the narrow gap. It took vet Kes, 34, an hour to reach him

It's a long way down: Collie dog Chip had been rounding up sheep when he slipped down the 80ft crevice and was only rescued when Kes Taylor (pictured) was lowered down by mountain rescue

She said: 'They picked me after some of the men had a go and got stuck half way down.

'Luckily for Chip I was thin enough to squeeze my way along the gap to reach him.'

The drama began when Chip fell down the crevice while rounding up sheep on a mountainside in Snowdonia, North Wales.

A mountain rescue team was called to search for the missing farm dog and heard him whimpering from inside the mountain.

Local vet Kes was called to treat the collie when he was brought to the surface.

But after the male rescuers failed to reach him, they asked Kes to descended into the crevice attached to ropes.

Apprehensive: Kes (pictured) had never been potholing before rescuing Chip. However, after other mountain rescue volunteers got stuck, she was the only one slim enough to wriggle down and get him

Stuck: Kes Taylor (pictured) was only going up the mountain to help the dog once it had been freed, but was 'roped' in to the rescue as she was thinnest

Encouraging: Kes said she hadn't expected to go into the crevice herself but the other mountain rescue volunteers talked her through it from above

Keen mountain walker Kes, of Llanberis, North Wales, said: 'I didn’t expect to spend my afternoon in a narrow crevice.

'I much prefer the wide open spaces of mountain sides and have never been potholing.

'But all the time the team members were encouraging me and I felt totally safe. They were fabulous.

'If we hadn’t have managed to find Chip he would have died.'

A helmet camera attached to a mountain rescue volunteer captured the incredible two-hour rescue mission as it unfolded inside the impossibly tight mountain crag crevice.

Mountain rescue team member Rob Johnson said: 'The whole time inside the crevice Kes was at risk of becoming stuck herself.

'She was incredibly brave and if it wasn’t for her we may never have reached Chip.'

Happy ending: Chip was brought up after being stuck for two days and was fed 'steak and sausages'

Help: Kes was guided by the mountain rescue team. The vet from Llanberis, North Wales, had never attempted a rescue like this before

Exhausting: Keen mountain walker Kes was helped out of the tiny gap by mountain rescue volunteers

Rob said the team knew it would be 'an interesting rescue' when they heard whimpering coming from inside the deep mountain crevice.

He said: 'The dog was found stuck in the bottom of a rock crevice that was 82ft deep, extremely narrow and halfway up a steep crag.

'One team member was volunteered as being the skinniest build and lowered down into the slot.

'But about half way down he became wedged and had to be pulled back up and out.'

'So we lowered Kes down and she spent an hour wriggling and worming her way down to him.

'The dog seemed miraculously unhurt after he reached the surface.

'We fed him sausages, steak and some dog food before he walked away with the team.

'It’s a shaggy dog story with a happy ending.'

Torchlight: Darkness had fallen on the Welsh mountainside by the time Kes had rescued Chip

Rescuers: The mountain rescue team are used to working on the Welsh mountainside
