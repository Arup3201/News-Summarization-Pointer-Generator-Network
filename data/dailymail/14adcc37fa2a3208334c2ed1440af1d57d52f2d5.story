A 19-year-old Mormon missionary died in Argentina on March 11 after becoming ill from E. Coli and her family back in Utah is deeply mourning her loss.

Brittany Nicole Scadlock began serving her 18-month mission in August of 2014 and no one ever expected her seemingly bright future to take such a dire turn.

A Go Fund Me page was set up by Scadlock's parents Terry and Nicole to help them and the rest of their family travel to see their daughter when she was sick. Sadly, they were too late.
