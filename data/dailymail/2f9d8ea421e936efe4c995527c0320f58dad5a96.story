Cheeky police have been caught on camera blaring KRS-One's Sound Of Da Police from the loudspeaker on their patrol car.

Bank Holiday ravers in Chelmsford, Essex, were left speechless when they saw the marked police car cruising the town centre belting out the early-Nineties rap classic.

Their mobile phone video of the unlikely situation includes the song's iconic chorus, in which KRS-One whoops to evoke the sound of a police siren.

The Sound Of Da Police: Grainy smartphone footage taken in the early hours of Bank Holiday Monday shows a marked police patrol car blaring the Nineties rap classic from its loudspeaker as it cruises through Chelmsford

Despite it's obvious law enforcement connotations, the song is an ironic choice for a patrol car given its evocation of police brutality, institutionalised racism and oppression.

A 15-second video uploaded to YouTube shows the Essex Police patrol car pull away in Chelmsford town centre with its speakers blasting out the rap anthem.

The white car, with distinctive yellow and blue checks, can clearly be heard playing the iconic line: 'Woop, woop, it's the sound of the police.'

Released in 1993, Sound Of Da Police was the second and final single from KRS-One's first solo album, Return Of The Boom Bap.

It
 has become an anti-authoritarian anthem, covered by bands such as Rage 
Against The Machine and notably featured in La Haine, the 1995 French 
cult cinema classic about youths from the Paris ghettoes clashing with 
the law.

The lyrics are 
explicitly critical of police, comparing them to slave overseers and 
accusing them of being complicit in the continuing oppression of Black 
people in the U.S.

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed they are investigating the video, which was apparently shot on Monday

One line focusing on the overuse of guns in American policing says: 'The officer has the right to arrest, and if you fight back they put a hole in your chest.'

Another jab at the police states: 'The real criminals are the C-O-P.'

'The police them have a little gun,' it states. 'So when I'm on the streets, I walk around with a bigger one.'

An Essex Police spokesman confirmed they are investigating the video.

'We have viewed the footage and are looking into the matter,' he said.
