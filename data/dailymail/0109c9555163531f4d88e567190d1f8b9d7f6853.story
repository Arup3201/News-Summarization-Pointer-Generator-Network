The latest issue of a notorious terror propaganda magazine has celebrated last month's deadly Boston Marathon bombing while warning that more attacks may be on the way.

Inspire magazine, the online English-language publication, applauds the actions of the Boston bombers, as well as the ricin-laced letters mailed to President Obama and various elected officials.

In an article entitled, 'Message to the American nation,' al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) commander Qassem al-Rimi says: 'The Boston events, the road accidents and the poisoned letters, disregard of the people behind them indicate that the control of your security has broken away.'

The latest issue of Inspire magazine features al Qaeda commander Qassem al-Rimi on the cover, and even includes a full-page tribute to Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev

Terror Attack: The two bombs went off near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 - 
returning the specter of terrorism to the United States for the first 
time since 9/11

He goes on: 'So grasp unto yourselves if you love yourselves.'

The cover of the magazine featured a photo of al-Rimi alongside a picture of the blood-soaked sidewalk of Boylston Street, where the twin blasts killed three people and injured more than 250 others.

The magazine also includes a full page
tribute to Boston bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a 
shootout with police days after the bombing.

In the memorial photo, Tsarnaev is 
pictured among bright sunlight, clouds and doves with the words of a 
text message he is believed to have sent his mother at one point, which 
reads: 'My dear mom, I will lay down my life for Islam. I'm gonna die 
for Islam Inshaa Allah (God willing).'

Terror guide: Instructions on how to build a pressure cooker bomb were featured in the notorious Inspire article 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom'

The magazine is 
dedicated to spreading al Qaeda's message, and even includes 
instructions on how to construct explosive devices.

About two weeks after the deadly twin 
blasts at the marathon, the surviving bombing suspect, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, reportedly told 
authorities that he had learned to make the pressure cooker bombs used in the attack through Inspire, which once
featured an article called 'Make a Bomb in the Kitchen of Your Mom,' and listed such a device as the 'most effective' weapon.

Speaking to the FBI from his hospital bed in Boston, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev reportedly confessed that he Tamerlan planted the bombs, and were driven to commit the attack by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Three people - Martin Richard, 8, 
Krystle Campbell, 29, and Lu Lingzi, 23 - were killed in the attack.

Tamerlan Tsarnaev was an ardent reader of jihadist websites and extremist propaganda, including Inspire magazine, an online publication produced by al Qaeda's Yemen affiliate.

In the Summer of 2010, an infamous article entitled 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your mom' listed a pressure cooker bomb as the 'most effective weapon' to inflict jihad.

The magazine has also endorsed lone-wolf terror attacks.

The method used to make the bomb is 
reminiscent of the failed attempt to bomb Times Square by Faisal Shahzad
in 2010 - and other terror strikes in India, Afghanistan, Nepal and 
Pakistan.

Another Inspire article has insisted that a good time to 'inflict maximum human losses' is during a sporting event.

The article reads: 'There are 
numerous such targets such as crowded sports arenas, annual social 
events, large international exhibitions, crowded market-places, 
skyscrapers, crowded buildings.'

Terror in Times Square: A pressure cooker bomb was one of the devices used in a foiled attempt to attack New York City in 2010

Shahzad
was sentenced to life in prison in the Times Square attempt, which was 
foiled when a street vendor near Shahzad's explosives-laden SUV saw it 
smoking and flagged down police officers.

Similar
pressure-cooker explosives have been used in Afghanistan, India, Nepal 
and Pakistan, according to a July 2010 FBI and Homeland Security 
intelligence report.Â 

'Placed carefully, such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack,' the report said.

Pressure
cooker devices were also used in the 2006 train bombings in Mumbai, 
India, which killed 209 people and injured hundreds more.

'Crude bombs': Both of the bombs were small, likely homemade devices and initial tests showed no C-4 or other high-grade explosive material
