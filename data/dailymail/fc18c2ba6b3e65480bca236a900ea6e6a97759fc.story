A four-year-old girl who was allegedly murdered by her mother's boyfriend was strangled with a power cord, beaten with a wooden rod, bitten and sexually abused, a court heard this week.

Teghan Skiba died in July 2010 from blunt force trauma to the head at hospital in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. Her body was covered bite marks that tore off flesh and bruising, the court was told on Wednesday.

Jonathan Douglas Richardson, 25, her mother's boyfriend of six months, faces the death penalty over the child's brutal death. He faces additional charges of felony child abuse, kidnapping and sexual offense.

Prosecutors said that Richardson tortured the four-year-old for ten days while her mother Helen Reyes was out of the state for Army Reserves' training.

The 25-year-old took the child to hospital on June 16, 2010, where he claimed that she had hit her head while jumping on furniture.

Doctors and nurses at the University of North Carolina hospital battled to save the child's life but she died days later from her horrific injuries.

According to wral.com, Dr Jonathan Privette, assistant 
chief medical examiner in Greenville, said he observed injuries to 
Teghan's neck that were consistent with markings of a power cord.

The doctor told the court: 'When she came to us, the brain has been damaged so severely that, and swelling was so much the brain matter was starting to come out.'

The child also had 66 bite marks, bruises, whip marks and lesions covering her body.

DNA from Teghan's blood was found on a wooden rod. The state expert testified that more than 30 items had evidence of the little girl's blood including underwear, pants, a sleeping bag and a pillow case.

A dentist told the court that bite marks on the child's body matched Richardson's teeth. Some were so severe that the flesh was torn off, the dentist said.

Helen Reyes took the stand on Thursday. She is charged with felony negligent child abuse causing serious bodily harm in connection with her daughter's death, according to ABC. She is free on bond and is yet to stand trial.

She told the court on Thursday: 'I am here for Teghan, for my daughter ... to get justice for her, because that man murdered my baby.'

Jurors at the court in Smithfield appeared visibly upset when shown autopsy photos this week.

The images caused the child's paternal grandfather to walk out of the court and her grandmother broke down in sobs.

Richardson's lawyer said his client was abused as a child and has mental health problems. The accused, who has smiled often during the trial, never sexually abused the child, his lawyer claimed.

The attorney described the four-year-old's death as an 'unbelievable tragedy' which the accused did not mean to happen.

According to wral.com, Police Deputy Matt DeSilva wept last week as he told the court that Teghan's injuries were 'the most horrifying thing I've ever seen done to a human being - especially a child'.Â 

On the witness stand on Tuesday, Helen Reyes' sister Maira said her family didn't approve of Richardson so her sister moved out with Teghan.

Authorities said the little girl was living with her mom and her boyfriend in a makeshift structure with no running water and no bathroom behind Richardson's grandparents' home.

The trial continues.
