A father shot dead his wife and two daughters before turning the gun on himself at their home.

David Andrus, 50, killed his 48-year-old wife Jeana in the basement before going upstairs and shooting his daughters Jessica, 22, and Jennifer, 16.

He shot his family in their faces before shooting himself at their home in Darien, Illinois, in an act of domestic violence.

Jeana, Jessica and Jennifer Andrus were killed by David Andrus at the family home in Darien, Illinois

His body was found on top of one of his daughters, said Richard Jorgensen, DuPage County Coroner.

David Andrus is believed to have been fired from his job at manufacturing firm Midtronics that morning on suspicion of theft, reports the Chicago Tribune.

The family lived with two of Andrus's nephews at the house, which was owned by his mother Betty before her death last year.

One nephew fled to a neighbor's house for safety while another was at work during the killings.

Neighbor Rachel Steinhaus told reporters that she heard one of the nephews arguing with with his uncle on Tuesday afternoon.

Later that day, she heard a pop and said she assumed the nephew was slamming his car door before driving away.

When police were seen surrounding the house, she called one of the nephews at work, who was unaware of what had happened.

Mrs Andrus's father said yesterday that the family would be buried together following a funeral service on Tuesday.

John Infanti told the Chicago Tribune: 'That's the way my daughter would have wanted it, and that's the way I want it. They had 28 good years together. You don't just forget that.

Neighbor Rachel Steinhaus told reporters that she had heard an argument between David Andrus and his nephew earlier that day

'Something happened to make him snap and, in a tragic moment, a lifetime disappears. But he's not that person. They're still a family and they'll be together.'

Jennifer was a member of the class of 2015 and bowling team member at Hinsdale South High School while her sister graduated in 2011.

Jennifer's friend William Crubaugh told the newspaper that Andrus 'spoiled' his daughters while family friend Rita Johns said the father was 'a loving and dedicated dad'.

Stephen Turner, Jeana Andrus's former boss at the USA Skate Center in Romeoville, said the company would donate money towards the family's funeral costs.

He said Mrs Andrus was fun-loving and generous, despite the family's financial hardship.
