Few are the stars who can boast the staying power of Kate Moss, a woman whose modelling career has spanned an incredible 20 years.

Despite hitting the big 4-0, she remains an icon - particularly in the eyes of artist and erstwhile journalist Russell Marshall, who is celebrating her birthday with the launch of a retrospective dedicated to portraits of the model.

Ever the icon: Despite hitting the big 4-0, Kate Moss remains as popular as ever, says artist Russell Marshall

Glamorous: The model's longevity and rock n' roll exploits have turned her into a legend

'The retrospective has been produced 
from my perspective,' he explains. 'Kate's been in the public eye as long as I've been 
working in the newspaper industry, so I've seen countless images of her 
appear on the picture desk.' 

The new exhibition includes some of the most iconic photographs of Moss ever taken, among them several that have come from newspaper archives and been reworked by the artist.

Starting with early portraits of the future supermodel as a 14-year-old, the exhibition, at the Imitate Modern gallery in Marylebone, charts her progress from ingÃ©nue to icon.

'Kate has done things get way on her terms,' adds Marshall. 'She's never been a slave to convention [and] that is a quality I admire.'

Although Marshall makes no secret of his penchant for creating work featuring the model, he's no stranger to working with other celebrities.

None, however, are typical tabloid favourites, with Marshall insisting that he's in the business of portraying icons, not 'celebs'.

Thus, other series feature Sid Vicious, Elvis Presley and Steve McQueen, although he admits that few inspire him quite so much as the Croydon supermodel.

'There are many celebrities but few become legends,' he adds. 'Kate Moss has achieved that status.'

Despite spending hours contemplating Ms Moss, Marshall reveals that he still can't quite put his finger on what makes her so special.

'If
 I knew exactly what makes Kate Moss a legend, or an icon as opposed to 
just a celebrity, I would probably be in artist management,' he begins.

'But Kate's 
silence is all part of the mystery and the reason why we love her.

'Either way, it's probably best not to analyse it too closely or you might destroy it. Then where would we be!'

40: A Kate Moss Retrospective opens today and runs until 15 February at Imitate Modern in Marylebone and online at beautifulcrime.com
