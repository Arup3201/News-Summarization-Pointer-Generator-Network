Travel photographer Andrei Duman's office has not always been this beautiful. 

The former investment banker spent years working in finance in order to fund his real passion, and the self-taught photographer, who has visited over seventy countries, has no plans of stopping yet. 

'My career has been split into two parts: by day, I've worked in finance, but my true passions are travel and photography, and I've devoted myself to traveling as much as I can,' he says.

'I want to see everything: the more outside my everyday or off the beaten track the better. The further away from the big city and wider open the space, the more I'm drawn to it. I want to see how people live, what they experience on a daily basis, what they eat...  

'I think we all should be exploring more, wanting to find out what is over that hill or in that canyon - even exploring our own environments in a new way. 

'I have learned more life lessons from my travels and meeting new people than through any other way and I want to see as much of this planet as I possibly can.  

'This world that we live in really is an amazing, vibrant and beautiful place, full of amazing things to explore and absorb and I think we all need to get packing.'

Here, MailOnline Travel showcases a selection of the photographer's best images, taken from around the world.
