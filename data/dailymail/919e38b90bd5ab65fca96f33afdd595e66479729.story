Jewish power list: Ed Miliband was named as the 20th most influential Jewish person on earth, despite continued misgivings over his leadership

Ed Miliband has been named as one of the most influential Jewish people in the world, despite continuing difficulties in the opinion polls.

Mr Miliband was ranked 20th in the table of the world's leading Jews, even though he has spoken infrequently about religion and declared 'I do not believe in God' shortly after he was chosen as Labour leader.

He appeared in the Jerusalem Post list of influential Jewish people despite continuing misgivings over his leadership.

His party's lead in the opinion polls has slumped with support for the Opposition standing at just 34 per cent - just three points ahead of the Tories despite their internal turmoil over Europe.

Lord Sainsbury of Turville, who has given more than £12million to the Labour Party, described Mr Miliband as 'average' and said that he has no intention of donating to the party again.

Mr Miliband appeared in the table of influence ahead of Sara Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister's wife.

Israeli Finance Minister Yair Lapid, who came second in the Israeli general election in February, was named as the most influential Jew in the world in the league tbale.

Jack Lew, the US Treasury Secretary, was second, while Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu was in third place.

Other famous names on the list include filmmaker Steven Spielberg, who was 13th, Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who is 16th in the table and worth an estimated £8.75billion, and Mayor of New York Michael Bloomberg who was 17th in the table.

Mr Miliband's father Ralph and grandfather were Jews who fled Belgium in 1940 for Britain as Nazi Germany invaded.

Under pressure: Mr Miliband has faced renewed questions over his leadership after the party performed poorly in the local elections earlier this month

Opinion poll: Labour's lead has fallen to just three points, despite the Conservative party's internal struggle over the timing of an EU referendum

But Ralph Miliband, a prominent Marxist 
historian, brought the Labour leader and his older brother David up in a
secular household.

Although Ed Miliband has shown little
interest in his religious background, he would be Britain's first 
Jewish Prime Minister since Benjamin Disraeli in 1880.

In
their article, the Jerusalem Post described Mr Miliband as 'a likely 
candidate for Prime Minister in the next election' and added that he is 
'credited with maintaining party unity' after a 'fractious' leadership 
election.

The pressure is 
back on the leader after Labour performed poorly in the local election 
polls and failed to win over voters in the south who deserted the party 
at the general election.

Strategists have blamed Mr Miliband's lack of clarity over Europe for their difficulties in the opinion polls.

Ed Miliband's commitment to the Zionist cause was called into question earlier this year.

When asked if he was a Zionist, he said he was and added he was a 'supporter of Israel'. But his party later played down the comments and said he had not used the word Zionist himself.
