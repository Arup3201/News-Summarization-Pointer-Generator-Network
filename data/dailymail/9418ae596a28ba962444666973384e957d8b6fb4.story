Manchester United are prepared to stump up £15million to beat Barcelona to the signature of Arsenal defender Thomas Vermaelen.

Manager Louis van Gaal is anxious for more signings following the club’s return from their pre-season tour in America and wants to close deals for Vermaelen and Ajax wing back Daley Blind before his Premier League bow against Swansea City on August 16.

Executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward accepts he will have to pay a premium price for Vermaelen however because Arsenal would prefer to see him go to La Liga than play for one of their Premier League rivals.

Barcelona have already made a £10million offer for the 28-year-old Belgian World Cup star but United have informed the London club they will top it.

Vermaelen was officially Arsenal's club captain last season but played only seven Premier League games due to the form of Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. He and the versatile Blind can also provide cover for left back Luke Shaw.

Van Gaal wants transfer business both in and out the club to gather pace in the next fortnight.

The Dutchman pointed out at his unveiling that he had approved rather than initiated United’s first two summer signings Ander Herrera and Shaw.

United made their third capture, teenage Serbian goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic, but Van Gaal wants to improve the balance of the squad, needing more defenders to play his preferred 3-4-3 formation following the departures of Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand and Patrice Evra.

A move for Borussia Dortmund’s highly-rated midfielder Marco Reus is likely to have to wait until next year when his £20million buy-out clause kicks in.

United’s tour players can expect to find about their futures from Van Gaal when they return to training on Friday.

Van Gaal has given the squad two days off after travelling nearly 15,000 miles across America but plans to work them hard physically on their return.

He has also promised the players to let them know who he wants to keep, and who are surplus to requirements and will either be sold or loaned out.

After a final rest day on Thursday, the players have been told to report to the Aon training complex at the end of the week with Van Gaal preparing to make his decision on the likes of Shinji Kagawa, Javier Hernandez, Wilfried Zaha and Michael Keane.

Marouane Fellaini and Anderson are also expected to be allowed to leave. They have been training all week with Fellaini given time off after the World Cup and Anderson suffering an injury that caused him to miss the tour to America.

Uncertain future: Marouane Fellaini could leave Old Trafford before the transfer window closes

Several of United’s former greats including Champions League winners Pau Scholes, Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole will pull on the red shirt again in Munich on Saturday in a match between Bayern All-Stars and a United legends team.

Former Old Trafford midfielder Owen Hargreaves – whose signing was labelled 'a disaster' by Sir Alex Ferguson – will line up in the game for Bayern against United.

Phil Neville will play in United’s team despite announcing on Wednesday he was no longer on United’s coaching staff.

Goalkeeper Tomasz Kuszczak, a title winner just four seasons ago, has been drafted in to replace Edwin van der Sar who is in south-east Asia with current club Ajax where he is marketing director.
