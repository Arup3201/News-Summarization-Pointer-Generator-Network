A man who claims a makeshift cemetery he created in his front garden is 'modern art' has horrified his neighbours with the sinister build.

The homeowner, known only as Mark, lined the driveway of his home in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear with six gravestones last Monday - in time for Halloween.

Although the man, who has lived in the house for 14 years, claims they are 'modern art', his neighbours have said they are now having nightmares and branded them 'disgusting'.

Creepy: A man who claims the graveyard he installed in his front garden is 'modern art' has horrified his neighbours in Tyne and Wear with his odd build

Bizarre: The man, known only as Mark, created the makeshift cemetery of six graves last Monday

It is thought the man, who neighbours say is seldom seen, employed people from a nearby cemetery to create the graveyard.

One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous said: 'I want them down, they're awful.

'I think it's totally disgusting and it's awful when you have to come out and look at them, it really is. I've had nightmares about it.

'He came out and said, "What do you think? Do you like my modern art?"

'I said, "No, I don't like them, it's like a graveyard". I really don't know what's going through his head putting them up.'

Graveyard: The new addition includes this rather sinister grave that appears to be a book with C? printed on it

Odd: One graves features a memorial book of with extract from both Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, left, and a quote from horror film Night of the Living Dead on the other, right

Unsettling: Another smaller grave features the words 'believe in nothing' in a downwards triangle

George Hall, 76, a retired boiler-maker, said: 'I think it's a bit daft. I don't know what he's thinking - you don't see him much.

'When he first started doing the garden he said he was going to put a lawn there but I don't know what happened after that - it's a bit different.

Removed: Neighbours, one of whom claims she is having nightmares because of the graves, hope the council will get involved and remove the cemetery

'I wouldn't say it was a very nice thing. But every man to his own.'

One of the disturbing headstones is engraved 
with a quote from 1968 horror film, Night of the Living Dead, and reads: 'They're coming to get you Barbara - they're here already. You're next!
You're next!'

Another 
carries a misquoted line from Mary Shelley's gothic novel Frankenstein, 
while another, which one neighbour finds particularly disturbing, is 
marked simply, 'C ?'

Little is known about the homeowner, but one neighbour said he is in his thirties, lives alone and has no family apart from a brother.

Another neighbour said the man has employed people from a cemetery to install the creepy creation.

She said: 'He out them up last Monday and got people from the cemetery to come and do it.

'I was out having coffee with my friends and my husband rang me and said there was people from the cemetery putting a gravestone in.

'When I got back they were all up. I looked at them putting them up and they just shrugged to say it's just our job but the guy told my husband that this is a first.

'Everyone's coming around in their cars and looking at them. According to the council he needs planning permission for them and we'll get letters if he does and I'll oppose it definitely.

'I think everybody will - it's not nice. There's plenty of houses overlooking graveyards if you want to live there.'

'Each to their own': Another neighbour said although he finds the graveyard odd, it's 'every man to his own'
