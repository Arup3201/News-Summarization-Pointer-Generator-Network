Roberto Martinez insists he will do “what is best for the club” when it comes to making a decision on Samuel Eto’o’s future.

The Cameroon striker has been the subject of interest from a number of teams, notably Sampdoria. He has made 12 starts for Everton in all competitions so far and if he makes another three, he will automatically trigger a clause in contract that secures another year at Goodison Park.

Eto’o made a bright start for Everton after joining them as a free agent in August but his impact has dwindled in recent weeks, raising the prospect that he will leave before the end of the transfer window. Martinez, however, is in no hurry to make a firm conclusion.

‘We have had a couple of enquiries, but nothing concrete,’ said Martinez. ‘With Samuel, We are going to take a couple of weeks to decide what the next step will be. I don’t rule anything out at the moment.

‘It may be that Samuel stays with us. We are going to decide what is best for the club and for Sam.’

The main issue for Martinez in the transfer window is whether he will bring in goalkeeping cover. Tim Howard is still injured and not expected to be fit until the middle of February, leaving the untried Russell Griffiths as understudy to Joel Robles.

‘We are still in the same position as we were before,’ he said. ‘We need a little bit of extra cover. We have got three terrific young keepers at the club but we just need that experience. We are going to look for a very specific profile.

Martinez, meanwhile, is ready to talk with England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate about his plans for Ross Barkley this summer and whether he will take him to the Czech Republic for the European Championships.

Southgate has raised the prospect that Barkley, who only has one Under 21 cap, could be part of his squad but Martinez is not sure whether that will be the right move for the 21-year-old, whose form has been the subject of some concern recently.

‘It depends on the type of role,’ said Martinez. It is impossible to give a straight answer but we have a good relationship with the FA and Gareth Southgate. Ross has been involved in the best possible tournament, which is the World Cup. I don’t think other tournaments could be as positive.

‘Those experiences with the Under 21s are to progress you to the senior level. Once you get to senior level, you are then blocking someone’s path. Ross has had terrific experiences but we will always be happy to assess it. We will speak about it, I am sure.’

Everton have not won a game since December 15 and will look to rectify that on Monday night against West Brom. Martinez is wary of the threat they pose under new management.

‘I always admire what Tony Pulis has achieved,’ he said. ‘He always found a way of making his team competitive with the players that he had. Stoke evolved in the Premier League and at Palace he found a way of using the wide men. His experience will be valuable for the second half of the season.

‘We are still involved in two competitions. February is going to be really challenging but we welcome that and we are looking forward to the busy periods that we have. We are looking into opportunities to go for a warm weather training camp. It gives you good opportunities.’
