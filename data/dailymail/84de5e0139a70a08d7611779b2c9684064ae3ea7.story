She's had mountains, parks and even a French flower market named in her honour but the Queen looked thrilled as she officially opened the latest addition to the list: Heathrow's new Terminal 2.

Dressed in a kingfisher blue ensemble by Angela Kelly, the monarch was on fine form as she and the Duke of Edinburgh met staff, including architect Luis Vidal.

After cutting the ribbon, the Queen was shown around the terminal, which has so far avoided the problems that beset the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008, before catching a flight to Belfast to begin a 
three-day tour.

The Duke of Edinburgh, who is known to have strong opinions on air travel, was dapper in a navy blue suit and although on chatty form, managed not to make another of his infamous gaffes.

One of his most famous came during a 2002 speech to the Aircraft Research Association, during which he told of his tongue-in-cheek horror of flying economy.

'If you travel as much as we do, you appreciate the improvements in aircraft design of less noise and more comfort,' he quipped, adding: 'Provided you don't travel in something called economy class, which sounds ghastly.'

Happily for the Duke and for Heathrow bosses, there was no repeat of the chaos that marred the opening of Terminal 5 in 2008.

Despite 
costing a record £4.3bn to complete, the terminal, which is exclusively 
used by British Airways, was forced to suspend check-in and cancel 
flights following a series of technical glitches.

Happily
 for passengers, Terminal 2's first few weeks have gone smoothly with 
the first flight to arrive, a United Airlines flight from Chicago, 
greeted by beaming Beefeaters rather than chaos.

The building, which sits on the site occupied by the original Terminal 2, took six years to complete and cost 
more than £2.5bn.

Among the airlines set to join United in the new terminal are Egyptair, Ethiopian, SAS, TAP Portugal and SWISS.

The Queen herself is to travel on to Belfast, and will join Theresa Villiers, the secretary of state for 
Northern Ireland, and First Minister Peter Robinson for a meeting at her
 official residence in the province, Hillsborough Castle.

Also at the meeting will be the Duke of Edinburgh and Stormont's Deputy First Minister, the controversial Martin McGuinness.

Tomorrow,
 will see the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh visit Crumlin Road Gaol, a
 former prison that closed in 1996 after 150 years.

The
 gaol, a nineteenth century grade one listed building, has recently been
 restored and reopened as a museum dedicated to the history of the 
Troubles and the men and women on both sides who were imprisoned there.

Popular: Along with Heathrow's new terminal, the Queen has also had national parks and mountains named in her honour

Heathrow's new Terminal 2 might be the latest addition to the list of places named after the Queen but it certainly isn't the only one.

From stunning stretches of Africa to a hefty chunk of Antarctica, FEMAIL rounds up the stunning spots with a very royal namesake.

QUEEN ELIZABETH NATIONAL PARK - UGANDA

One of the loveliest of Uganda's national parks, Queen Elizabeth opened in 1954 and covers 764 square miles.

Along with the 'big five' (lions, leopards, elephants, buffalo and giraffe), the park has an abundance of warthogs and Uganda Kob antelopes, as well as hippos and crocodiles who live in the Kazinga Channel that cuts through the park.

In total, 95 species of mammal and more than 500 types of bird live in the park, including a rare group of tree-climbing lions who live near Ishasha in the southern reaches.

QUEEN ELIZABETH RANGES - CANADA

Part of the Canadian Rockies, the Queen Elizabeth Ranges occupy the southeastern side of Jasper National Park in Alberta.

The stretch, which got its royal moniker to mark the coronation in 1953, includes some impressively large peaks, the biggest of which is Mount Unwin.

QUEEN ELIZABETH LAND

The UK's Antarctic territory, Queen Elizabeth Land is nearly twice the size of Britain and covers an impressive 169,000sqm.

Bordered by the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, much of Queen Elizabeth Land is icy tundra, with Emperor Penguins and Weddell Seals among the local residents.

Australia's Antarctic territory is also named after the Queen but was given its name prior to the Coronation and is known as Princess Elizabeth Land.

PORT ELIZABETH - ST VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

The capital of Bequia, the second-largest island in the Grenadines island chain, Port Elizabeth was given its name in 1952 when the Queen ascended to the throne.

Perched on the edge of the beautiful Admiralty Bay, the harbour is home to the St Vincent Docks - the main source of commerce on the island - as well as a small market.

QUEEN ELIZABETH ISLANDS - CANADA

The most northerly cluster of islands in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago, Queen Elizabeth Islands were renamed in 1953 to mark the Queen's coronation.

Covering 161,000sqm, the islands are home to 14 per cent of the world's total number of ice caps and glaciers, and have a population of 400 people.

Despite the tiny population, many of the islands are among the world's largest, among them Ellesmere Island which at 75,767sqm is the world's 10th largest island - one behind the UK which is ninth.
