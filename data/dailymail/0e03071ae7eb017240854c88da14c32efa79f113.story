Renowned British neurologist Oliver Sacks says he wants to live life to the full after revealing that he has terminal liver cancer.

Writing about his illness in a poignant and inspiring article, Professor Sacks, who made his name treating patients with rare conditions, said: ‘It is up to me now to choose how to live out the months that remain to me. I have to live in the richest, deepest, most productive way I can.’

Professor Sacks, who was awarded a CBE in 2008, said his ‘predominant feeling is one of gratitude’ for the life he has lived.

British neurologist and best-selling author Oliver Sacks (pictured above in 2008) revealed that he has been diagnosed with terminal cancer 

Sacks's 1973 Awakenings detailed his real-life experience with patients who suffered from a condition known as encephalitis lethargica, and was adapted into a 1990 film (scenes from the film above) of the same name starring Robin Williams (right) and Robert De Niro (left)

Awakenings explores how patients lived with the condition and how they were able to exit, however briefly, from their catatonic states with the aid of a drug (above Williams, left, and De Niro, right, in scenes from the film)

The 81-year-old added: ‘This does not mean I am finished with life.

‘On the contrary, I feel intensely alive, and I want and hope in the time that remains to deepen my friendships, to say farewell to those I love, to write more, to travel if I have the strength, to achieve new levels of understanding and insight.

‘I feel a sudden clear focus and perspective. There is no time for anything inessential.’

The London-born academic, who is now a professor of neurology at New York University School of Medicine, was diagnosed with cancer nine years ago.

A rare eye tumour was removed, leaving him blind in that eye, but the cancer has now spread.

The professor said it was very rare for such tumours to do so and that he was ‘among the unlucky 2 per cent’.

He wrote in the New York Times: ‘A month ago, I felt that I was in good health, even robust health.

‘At 81, I still swim a mile a day. But my luck has run out – a few weeks ago I learned that I have multiple metastases [tumours] in the liver.’ He went on: ‘I feel grateful that I have been granted nine years of good health and productivity since the original diagnosis, but now I am face to face with dying.

‘The cancer occupies a third of my liver, and though its advance may be slowed, this particular sort of cancer cannot be halted.’

He added: ‘I cannot pretend I am without fear. But my predominant feeling is one of gratitude. I have loved and been loved; I have been given much and I have given something in return; I have read and travelled and thought and written.

The 81-year-old (above left in 2010 and right with director Peter Brook in 2013) wrote about his condition in an essay in the New York Times' Opinion section today. He wrote that he recently learned he was among the 'unlucky two percent' in whom a rare kind of melanoma had spread

Sacks (above pictured outside his childhood home) said that he feels intensely alive and that he wants to deepen his friendships, say farewell to those he loves, to write and travel, and attain new levels of understanding and insight during the time he has left

‘I have had an intercourse with the world, the special intercourse of writers and readers.

‘Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure.’

Professor Sacks studied at Oxford before moving to America to continue his medical studies.

He has never married and describes himself as celibate.

At New York University School of Medicine he became known for his expertise on chronic sleeping sickness, resulting in his breakthrough 1973 book, Awakenings.

The book, about patients who were treated with a drug that woke them up after years in a catatonic state, inspired the 1990 Oscar-nominated film of the same name, starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro.

He has written several other acclaimed books about unusual medical conditions, including The Man Who Mistook His Wife For A Hat, which tells the story of patients with visual agnosia – a rare neurological disorder that makes them unable to recognise familiar objects.

In addition to Awakenings, some of Sacks's other books have delved into topics including deafness, colorblindness and hallucinations. He also wrote the critically acclaimed The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, which explored case histories of a variety of unusual neurologic conditions
