Malcolm Glazer, the man who lead the controversial takeover of Manchester United, has died, according to a statement from his NFL franchise the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The American businessman, 85, leaves behind his wife, Linda, six children and 14 grandchildren.

The statement from the American Football team, which he also owns, said: 'The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are saddened to announce the passing of Owner/President Malcolm Glazer earlier this morning at the age of 85.'

Sad news: The announcement from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers website

Born in Rochester, New York as one of seven children, Glazer took over the family watch-parts business at age 15 following the death of his father and then continued his foray into the professional world, investing in other businesses.

Glazer owned or was a substantial shareholder of a diverse portfolio of international holdings and public companies, including: First Allied, Zapata Corporation, Houlihan’s Restaurant Chain, Harley Davidson, Formica, Tonka, Specialty Equipment and Omega Protein.

In 2005, Glazer purchased Manchester United and in that time the club earned five league titles, as well as a Champions League title.

But his tenure as owner has not been without controversy. Many supporters claim the squad has been on the decline since 2009 and the Glazer have been shielded by the ‘genius’ of long-serving former manager Sir Alex Ferguson.

They claim club's spending power has been dented by spending hundreds of 
millions on financial restructuring and debt 
payments, and this has limited funds available for investment in the 
playing squad.

The club had no debts before the takeover and now owes nearly £400m.

Glazer, a resident of Palm Beach, Florida, had been in poor health since April 2006 when a pair of strokes left him with impaired speech and limited mobility in his right arm and leg.

His sons Joel, Bryan and Ed have looked after the running of both teams - including overseeing the appointment of Van Gaal to replace Reds manager David Moyes after his ill-fated regime.

A statement on the Manchester United website said: 'Glazer's death is not expected to have any significant effect on the ownership of United, with the family retaining a 90 per cent share in the club.'

'The thoughts of everyone at Manchester United are with his family tonight,' the Premier League club added.

In March 2010, Forbes ranked him as tied for the world's 400th richest person, estimating his net worth at $2.4billion (£1.58billion).

He 
purchased the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for a then-NFL record $192million in 
1995, taking over one of the worst-run and least successful franchises 
in professional sports.

And
 while Glazer once said he probably overpaid by $50 million, the value 
of the team has more than quadrupled since he assumed control.

A private family funeral service will be held for Mr Glazer, the spokesman added. No further details of the circumstances surrounding Mr Glazer's death have been released.
