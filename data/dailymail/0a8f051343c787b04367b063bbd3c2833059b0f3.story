Liverpool will have to move quickly to land Fiorentina goalkeeper Norberto Neto as the Brazilian goalkeeper has a verbal agreement to join Juventus at the end of the season – and is being offered around £1.5m a year net salary to join the Serie A Champions.

Liverpool are searching for a goalkeeper to provide competition for Simon Mignolet and Brad Jones and the 25-year-old Brazilian is high on their list with the club examining their options this month after missing out on former Barcelona keeper Victor Valdes, who signed for Manchester United.

But Neto has also attracted attention from Juventus – though he would be up against club legend Gianluigi Buffon for the No.1 shirt there - while at Liverpool he would have a clearer route to first-team football.

Neto is out of contract at the end of the season at Fiorentia and so attracting attention from major clubs.

Liverpool’s best hope would be to convince him that he more chance establishing himself in the first-team at Anfield – but they would have to top Juve’s wage offer, which equates to around £55,000 a week in the UK.

Having missed out on Valdes, Liverpool’s options are limited but Sampdoria’s Sergio Romero, the Argentinian No.1, is also out of contract this summer and therefore available for a limited fee this January.
