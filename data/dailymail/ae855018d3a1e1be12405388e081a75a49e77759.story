Female admirers hoping to snag Olympic golden boy Ryan Lochte as a potential boyfriend best think again.

The 27-year-old U.S. athlete's mother, Ike Lochte, has said that her son only has time for 'one-night stands' and that he is unable to commit to a single girl because he's 'always on the go'.

It comes after the swimming star revealed more of his bachelor lifestyle toÂ Women's Health magazine, telling one of its reporters that his preferred look on a woman is one of his 'long-sleeve button-down shirts and that's all'.

Revealing: The star's mother added that her son simply has no time for girls, let alone serious relationships

Ike Lochte told the Today show yesterday that her son puts everything into his sporting career, which has landed him five Olympic gold medals.

She said: 'Everything he has done has been to the max. He's unique, loving, and he challenges himself all the time.'

The athlete from Rochester, New York shed further insight into his love life during the Women's Health interview.

He said that when he sees a woman he wants to meet, he simply makes eye contact.

'Some guys keep staring, but I'll give a wink and come back later, because it keeps her thinking,' he explained.

He did admit that there are some things about women that confuse him.

'It's impossible to know what they're thinking,' he said. 'If I could have one 
superpower, I'd be like Mel Gibson in What Women Want, where he reads 
women's minds.'

The sporting star added that his second most preferred look on women is 'white jeans' before admitting that, like other men, he swaps sex stories with his friends.

He said the most attractive thing about a women is keeping a 'fit body'.

Model and former Baywatch babe Carmen Electra was also pointed out as his celebrity crush.

True fans of the swimmer will also be 
interested to learn that he sleeps 'mostly naked' and prefers having sex
with the lights on.

Mr Lochtie also touched on his 
passion for fashion, which is often demonstrated when he's out 
representing his country with Team USA.

He was seen wearing a black fedora to the pool during a training session prior to the London Games' Opening Ceremony last week.

He is also known to sport bedazzled grills on his teeth during public appearances, although he was allegedly told he would not be able to claim medals if he wore the diamond-encrusted grill in future.

He told the magazine that having fashion sense is important to him.

'Really
important,' he said. 'It's how your personality comes out. I don't have
a set style, but I try not to dress like everyone else.'

Cover star: He became the fourth man to have ever appeared on the front cover of U.S. Vogue magazine

The sporting champion told The New York Times earlier this year: 'I want to be different, and fashion gives me the outlet to do that'.

In fact, he said he 'hated talking about swimming', adding that there is more to him than the sport.

'I don't want to be stuck in the swimming world,' he said. 'I don't just eat, swim, sleep - I don't do that.'

Most notably, Mr Lochte appeared on the front cover 
of U.S. Vogue magazine prior to the Olympics, his beloved industry's undisputed 
fashion bible.

The swimmer became the fourth man to ever be featured on its front cover.

He and a handful of his sporting peers including Hope Solo and Serena Williams, 
took part in a photo shoot with American It model Karlie Kloss, which also
appeared inside the issue's pages.

The star's admission is not the only reason he is seeing headlines today.

MailOnline revealed that his younger brother, Devon, 22, a one-time strong aspiring swimmer, was busted for allegedly selling marijuana to a police informant earlier this year in Florida.

Devon had once announced to the world that he hoped to compete alongside his brother on an Olympic relay team some day.
