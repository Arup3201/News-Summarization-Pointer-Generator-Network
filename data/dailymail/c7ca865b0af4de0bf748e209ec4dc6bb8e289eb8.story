He lived most of his life looking over his shoulder after famously becoming a mafia turncoat to help jail his gangster friends.

Mobster: Henry Hill died yesterday, just a day after his 69th birthday, after a long battle with an undisclosed condition

But the ‘rat’ immortalised by actor Ray Liotta in the Hollywood mob classic Goodfellas has died at the age of 69 – of natural causes.

Henry Hill’s three decades in hiding did play some part in his passing. He died at a hospital in Los Angeles on Tuesday having suffered a heart attack brought on by years of smoking, a habit he blamed on his nerves.

But right to the end, he managed to stay one step ahead of the mafia assassins he long feared.

In 1990, his life was turned into the Martin Scorsese crime classic in which he was played by Liotta alongside Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci.

Hill’s last major job with his gang was the Lufthansa heist at John F Kennedy airport in New York in December 1978, which netted them a then record £3.2million. For the last 30 years he had been in a witness protection programme, having turned against the mafia and informed on them to the FBI to save his own skin.

In recent times however he had ventured out in public more – opening a restaurant called Wiseguys, launching his own brand of spaghetti sauce and appearing on US TV talking about gangster movies.

Announcing his death, Hill’s girlfriend Lisa Casserta said he ‘struggled with alcoholism’. She said Hill had recently made his peace with his family, but ‘I don’t think he ever got over his demons’.

Born on June 11, 1943, in the tough Brownsville area of New York, Hill was the fifth of seven children and the first son to his Sicilian mother Carmella and his father, also called Henry.

Against his father’s wishes Hill got in with the mafia crowd aged 11 when he started hanging around with the infamous Lucchese family. Lured by power and money, Hill gradually became more entrenched with the family and while his half-Sicilian genes – his father was Irish – meant he could never be a fully-fledged member of the family, he was able to be an associate.

His first arrest came when he was 16 years old and he carried out the Lufthansa raid after serving a six-year prison sentence in the Seventies.

Following his arrest for the robbery on April 27, 1980, detectives played him wire taps of other  mob members threatening to kill him but he refused to talk, at least for a while.

Eventually, Hill testified against his former associates to avoid a possible execution by his crew or going to prison for his crimes.

The testimony led to 50 convictions, but it meant that Hill, his wife Karen, and their two children had to be put in the US Marshals’ Witness Protection Programme in 1980. They also had to change their names, and move to undisclosed locations in Omaha, Nebraska; Independence, Kentucky; Redmond, Washington; and Seattle, Washington.

Due to his numerous crimes while in witness protection, Hill and his wife, from whom he separated in 1989, were expelled from the programme in the early 1990s.

In 2006, at the encouragement of Liotta, Hill entered rehabilitation to combat his drug addiction problems. He was arrested on a number of occasions in recent years for public drunkenness.
