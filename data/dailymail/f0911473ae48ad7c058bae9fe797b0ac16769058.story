While most Australians were spending Good Friday settling in for the Easter long weekend, one group of committed drinkers spent their day loutishly terrorising a Perth neighbourhood instead.

A video uploaded to YouTube last Wednesday by University of Western Australia student Ben Fromson, 22, shows the men drunkenly cycling from house to house in an event they called the ‘Tour de Fridge’.

Visiting seven houses on their all-day drinking endeavour, the almost 80 men reportedly consumed 1,600 beers – an average of 20 each.

Unconcerned with the unsightly behaviour neighbours were subjected to, the men spent the warm day engaged in a public display of inappropriateness.

Their 'tour' started with the men converging on their bicycles at one participant’s house, where they poured wine from a cask into one anothers mouths.

At another early point in their tour, a smaller group of men can be seen pouring beer onto one participant’s hairy breasts and drinking it from his bare skin.

As the day progressed, some of the men began removing their clothing and jumping into swimming pools.

Being so intoxicated that they were vomiting wasn’t even enough to deter some of them – merely serving as an opportunity to empty their stomachs so they could drink more.

It might seem like harmless fun to some, but the group appear to be showing no concern for the safety of local residents who may have come across the group.

Converging at a skateboarding park, intended for residents of the community to enjoy during the daytime – the men continued to put themselves at risk by jumping on tour participants as they attempted to perform bicycle tricks.

Even potentially getting an infringement from police wasn’t enough to deter some of the rowdy revellers – with some participants continuing to drink alcohol during the ride on to the next house.   

MailOnline has sought comment from Western Australia Police and the City of Swan Council.
