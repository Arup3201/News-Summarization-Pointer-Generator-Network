A former female jail worker in Washington County, Oregon, has been sentenced to more than four years in prison for repeatedly having sex with a convicted rapist in a supply closet.

Ex-Washington County Jail staffer Jill Curry, 39, cried in court on Monday as she read out a statement in which she claimed that Jang-Li Delgado Galban, a 25-year-old gang member housed in the jail's maximum-security unit, had seduced her. 

Judge Charles Bailey was less than convinced by Curry’s tears. 'I find that stupid and ludicrous,' he said.

Curry, who is married to a sheriff's deputy, had pleaded guilty last month to custodial sexual misconduct and other charges stemming from her contact with Delgado Galban. 

Authorities said the sexual misconduct occurred while a deputy was at lunch, when Curry, a civilian jail services technician, was alone in the unit's control room, reports The Oregonian.

Curry pushed a button to unlock the inmate's cell and the pair would then meet in a supply closet to have sexual relations. This occurred 13 times, said prosecutor Jeff Lesowski. 

A probation officer who conducted a pre-sentencing investigation had recommended a prison sentence of less than two years, which the defense asked the judge to impose.

Judge Bailey went above the state's recommendation and sentenced Curry to four years and two months in prison.

The Multnomah County Sheriff's Office first started their investigation into Curry's actions on July 8, 2014, when someone called into the professional standards unit to report the jail services technician.

Curry was placed on administrative leave that day, pending a criminal investigation.

She had been working in the sheriff's office since October 2004, serving different parts of the jail including booking, inmate units and the control center.

After her arrest, Curry was booked into the Washington County Jail and held on $120,000 bond.

An article published in The Oregonian in 2010 said that in December 2009, Delgado-Galban, then 20 years old, allegedly broke into a woman's apartment in Hillsboro and raped her.

The suspect later agreed to a plea deal, as part of which he admitted to one count of burglary with the intent to commit rape in exchange for having the rape charges dropped.

In the wake of the scandal, the Washington County Jail has added surveillance cameras and beefed up security throughout the facility to prevent anything like this from happening again

In December 2010, Delgado-Galban was sentenced to three years and eight months in prison, and ordered to register as a sex offender upon his release.

But according to sheriff's officials, he failed to meet the conditions of the plea agreement, which landed him behind bars in the Washington County Jail where he encountered Curry.
