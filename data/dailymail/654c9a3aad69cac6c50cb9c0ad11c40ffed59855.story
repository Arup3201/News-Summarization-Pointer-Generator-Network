The military judge presiding over the case of the Fort Hood shooter has blocked several key pieces of evidence that prosecutors said would explain the mindset of the soldier accused in the 2009 rampage.

On Monday it was revealed that the judge has banned prosecutors from giving any speculation into Major Nidal Hasan’s motive in the shooting that left 13 dead and 30 others wounded, including the belief that he felt he had a ‘jihad duty’ to carry out the attack.

Prosecutors had asked the judge to approve several witnesses and various evidence to support what they allege motivated Hasan but the judge, Col. Tara Osborn, blocked nearly all of it.

Motive unknown: The judge has blocked several pieces of evidence that could give insight into accused killer Major Nidal Hasan's mindset at the time of the 2009 shooting on Fort Hood Army base in Texas

Osborn barred any reference Hasan Akbar, a Muslim soldier sentenced to death for attacking fellow soldiers in Kuwait during the 2003 Iraq invasion.

Prosecutors wanted to prove Hasan's attack was a 'copycat,' but the judge said introducing such material would 'only open the door to a mini-trial' of Akbar.

Snapped? Hasan was an Army psychiatrist until 2009, when he admits to killing 13 and injuring 30. He was found guilty today on all counts of against him

She also said such evidence would result in a 'confusion of issues, unfair prejudice, waste of time and undo delay.'

The judge said prosecutors also couldn't introduce three emails, ruling that the needed redactions would make them irrelevant.

The contents of the emails were never disclosed, but the FBI has said Hasan sent numerous emails starting in December 2008 to Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical U.S.-born Islamic cleric killed by a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.

The judge also told prosecutors that they couldn't cite Hasan's interest years ago in conscientious objector status and his past academic presentations. Osborn said such evidence was too old and irrelevant.

However, the judge will allow evidence about Internet searches on Hasan's computer around the time of the attack and websites that Hasan had listed as 'favorites.'

Osborn said that information was more timely.

Military prosecutors opened the trial by saying they would show that Hasan felt he had a 'jihad duty,' referring to a Muslim term for a religious war or struggle.

After calling almost 80 witnesses during the last two weeks, prosecutors said Friday that they would begin tackling the question this week.

Prosecutors indicated that they had between 15 and 25 witnesses left, though it wasn't immediately clear how Monday's ruling would shorten prosecutors' case.

Making his case: Hasan, seen with a beard in court on August 8, is serving as his own lawyer in the case but has two standby defense attorneys on hand

On guard: Security has been on high alert throughout the trial, which is being held on the grounds of Fort Hood

Either way, Hasan was expected to get his chance to defend himself as early as Tuesday.

But the Army psychiatrist - who is acting as his own attorney - has put up little in a way of a defense so far and remained largely silent during the first two weeks of his trial.

He signaled before trial that he had just two witnesses and during a barely one-minute opening statement, he told jurors that evidence 'will clearly show that I am the shooter,' but he said it wouldn't tell the whole story.

Hasan faces numerous charges of murder and attempted premeditated murder.

If convicted, he could face the death penalty.
