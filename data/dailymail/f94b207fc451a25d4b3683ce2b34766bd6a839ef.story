Two Taliban rockets landed inside the U.S. embassy compound in Kabul early on Christmas Day.

No one was injured but the attack underlines Afghanistan's continuing security problems as many foreigners in the capital held festive celebrations.

Taliban militants, who have been fighting the U.S.-backed government since being ousted from power in 2001, claimed responsibility for the rocket attacks, which included at least one other strike in the city.

Rocket attacks in Kabul have been rare in recent years, but the insurgents have vowed to step up pressure on the U.S. and Afghan authorities before next year's presidential election and the withdrawal of U.S.-led NATO combat forces.

'At approximately 6:40 local time in Kabul, approximately two rounds of indirect fire impacted the U.S. Embassy compound,' a statement from the embassy said.

'All Americans are accounted for and no injuries were sustained. The Embassy continues to investigate the attack.'

Another rocket landed near a hill where 
former kings and members of the old royal family are buried in a large 
mausoleum, a spokesman for the National Directorate of Security told 
AFP.

'One
 impacted near Maranjan hill, about one mile (1.6 kilometres) from the 
presidential palace. There are no reported casualties,' Lutfullah Mashal
 said.

In a text 
message to AFP, the Taliban claimed to have caused heavy casualties, but
 the insurgents regularly make exaggerated claims after attacks.

'Today
 at around 6am four rockets were fired at the U.S. embassy in Kabul. All
 hit the target (causing) heavy casualties,' Taliban spokesman 
Zabihullah Mujahid said in the message.
