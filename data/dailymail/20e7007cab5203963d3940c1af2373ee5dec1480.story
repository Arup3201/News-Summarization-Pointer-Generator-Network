Paul McGinley hopes that the 2014 Ryder Cup at Gleneagles will go down as the ‘noisiest’ in the event’s history.

Europe’s barely believable comeback victory at Medinah two years ago was even more impressive for being achieved amid the din of fervent home support, which had been whipped into a frenzy by the likes of Bubba Watson, Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley.

But Europe captain McGinley hopes Europe fans can roar his team on to victory in Perthshire next week and again silence the Americans, who are hoping to avoid an eighth defeat in the last 10 Ryder Cups.

McGinley, in an exclusive video for Sportsmail, has given an insight into his dreams for the upcoming contest in Scotland, as well as his memories of past competitions.

The Ryder Cup captain, who is a staff player for adidas Golf, also reveals personal insights, such as his favourite golf course, ideal playing partners and most cherished Ryder Cup memories, all of which can be seen in the video below.

While the 47-year-old, admits he has admiration for loud-and-proud American patriotism, the skipper admits he hopes Tom Watson’s team are silenced into submission by the home support at Gleneagles.

‘Home advantage is very important in the Ryder Cup,’ said McGinley. ‘We’re certainly looking forward to playing in front of our home crowd. It’s going to be a lot of fun and hopefully this will go down in record as being the noisiest Ryder Cup ever.’

Lee Westwood was the man who played a very successful practical joke on McGinley in 2010

McGinley is due to play a practice round with US President Barack Obama ahead of the showdown in Scotland, and he also gave an insight into the conversation he would hold with the leader of the free world, who is well known for his love of golf.

‘I’ll tell Barack Obama that the Ryder Cup is a great a sporting event and a great golfing event,’ said McGinley. ‘It’s all about passion and representing your country.

‘As much as we as Europeans are very proud to represent Europe I think it’s great to see the Americans, the American national anthem and how passionate Americans feel representing their country.’

If McGinley appears ready to poke a bit of fun at the President over recent US defeats in the competition, he also reveals that he was once the butt of the best practical joke at a Ryder Cup during the contest at Celtic Manor in 2010. 

A cheeky Lee Westwood was the culprit, which should make the Englishman even more grateful for his wildcard selection by McGinley.
