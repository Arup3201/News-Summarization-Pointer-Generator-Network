Weeping Kurdish mourners today branded Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan a 'murderer' as they buried 35 civilians killed in a botched air attack.

The victims, half aged 17 to 20, were smuggling along the border when they were mistaken by Turkish military jet bombers for Kurdish rebels based in Iraq.

Many women lay on the ground wailing for their loss as the coffins were carried to Gulyazi cemetery, close to the Iraqi border, from the nearby town of Uludere where a service was held at the mosque.

They were draped in red, yellow and green, the colours 
associated with Kurdish identity and the rebel group PKK.

After thousands walked along a mountain footpath, news agency video showed  people
digging graves on a hill near Gulyazi, the village home of some of 
the dead smugglers.

In the crowd footage, one poster 
showed an image of Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed chief of the PKK, whose 
Kurdish acronym stands for Kurdistan Workers' Party.

Grieving families urged rebels to 
take revenge for the deaths, according to Firat, a pro-Kurdish news 
agency.

The death toll is one of the deadliest episodes in the conflict between the Turkish state and Kurdish rebels who took up arms in 1984.

Emotional: A mourner wipes away a tear while others have their heads bowed in respect for the victims

As the mass burials went on, 
stone-throwing demonstrators clashed for the second day with police who 
fired tear gas and water cannon in several cities in the mostly Kurdish 
southeast.

Firat, a 
pro-Kurdish news agency, said 30 people were arrested in Diyarbakir, the
region's biggest city. One person was injured and six arrested in Van 
city, according to the state-run Anadolu news agency.

A sombre Mr Erdogan described the attack 
near the border village of Ortasu in Sirnak province as 'unfortunate' 
and 'saddening.'

He said 
two F-16 planes bombed the area after images provided by drones showed a crowd ofÂ 
40 approaching the border from the Iraqi side.

'It was revealed later that they were part of a group smuggling cigarettes, diesel fuel and such,' he said.

According to Mr Erdogan, such smuggling is usually done by groups of just three to
five people. He said at least two recent deadly attacks on military 
outposts near the Iraq-Turkey border were carried out by guerrillas who 
smuggled guns across the border on mules.

Four hours of official video footage of the raid will be examined, he said.

Noncombatants have often been caught in the crossfire of Turkey's war, but the latest toll on civilians has further soured relations between the government and ethnic Kurds who have long faced discrimination.

A government campaign to reconcile with Kurds by granting them more rights has stalled amid a surge in fighting this year.

As trade unionists and other groups planned a protest in Istanbul this evening about 500 Iraqi Kurds 
denounced the airstrikes in a rally in the city of Irbil in the 
Kurdish-controlled region of northern Iraq.

In an email statement, the PKK described the deaths as a 'massacre,' and referred to 'technical and intelligence support' provided by the U.S.

America recently deployed four Predator drones to Turkey from Iraq following the U.S withdrawal from the country to assist Turkey in its fight against the rebels.
