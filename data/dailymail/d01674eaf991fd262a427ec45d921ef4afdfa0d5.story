Tonight, Mick Jagger will be communicating with a rapt audience of fans while on stage with the Rolling Stones at the Marine Bay Sands arena in Singapore.

Some 6,740 miles away, his former wife Jerry Hall will be sending out her own message loud and clear.

For Jerry, 57, has studiously picked a moment when Mick and his new partner L’Wren are firmly out of town to host a rather extraordinary baby shower at their former marital home in Richmond, Surrey.

Rock royalty babies: Jade Jagger, 42, is having a baby in May - and her daughter Assisi next month.

Jerry will be celebrating the imminent arrival of a new step-granddaughter by her stepdaughter Jade, 42, whose baby is due in May, and of a step-great-granddaughter by Jade’s daughter Assisi, 21, who is expecting a baby next month.

The baby shower will be impeccably A-list — lavish enough to require half a dozen cases of vintage champagne — and a very clear demonstration of her continued pivotal role in the Jagger dynasty as its undisputed matriarch.

According to pals, the party will deliver a pointed message to Jade’s father Mick and to his fashion designer partner L’Wren Scott about what is seen as a lack of enthusiasm on their side for the impending little arrivals.

‘Jerry is going to such trouble because she has always been fantastic and inclusive to Jade, and they genuinely have a great relationship,’ says a friend of Jerry’s.

‘But she is also doing it to have a little pop at Mick and at L’Wren whom, to put it mildly, the children are not so keen on. They even call her the black spider.’

So who is attending tonight’s extravaganza? What will they be eating, and how will they be toasting the health of the latest additions to the Jagger clan?

We give a sneak preview of an impossibly glamorous — and complicated — gathering.

QUEEN BEE JERRY

Jade Jagger has, of course, nothing biologically to do with Jerry Hall. She is the daughter of Nicaraguan beauty Bianca Perez-Mora Macias and Mick Jagger. When Jerry met Mick at a party in 1976, she was with fiance Bryan Ferry and Mick was still nominally the husband of Bianca. Within a year Bianca and Mick were divorced.

But because Jerry has been associated with the Jagger clan for almost 40 years, she is now widely considered the matriarch of the clan.

By hosting a baby shower, Jerry may indeed be sending a covert message to her replacement, but it also demonstrates that Jerry has a big maternal heart and masses of charm.  

She has always been surprisingly good at fostering a kind of sisterhood between the various elements of Mick’s family and always did her best by Jade. (The Rolling Stone, remember, has seven children by four women.).

Jerry has always tried to lessen the hurt Jade felt from the break-up of her parents’ marriage.

I’m
 told that Jerry included Jade ‘in every single birthday, christening 
and holiday’ when she was with Mick and Jade was growing up.

What’s
 more, Jerry’s daughter Georgia May, 22, went to the private school 
Ibstock Place, in Roehampton, South-West London, at the same time as 
Jade’s daughters Amba and Assisi. They were always friends, so there is 
an added connection there.

Jade
 herself bonds the family because Mick has always idolised her. When she
 was born in October 1971, he said: ‘She will be called Jade because she
 is very precious and quite, quite perfect.’

He
 has since remarked that she was the one good thing to come out of his 
ill-fated marriage to Bianca. Jerry, curiously, went on to become 
friendly with Bianca. The two women occasionally have tea together 
in London.

MESSAGE TO MICK

Not coming: Great-grandfather and grandfather-to-be Mick Jagger and partner L'Wren Scott

Jade
 was a little reticent about announcing her own baby news, allowing 
Assisi to come forward first and get a Hello! deal under her belt before
 revealing on Twitter last month that she, too, was pregnant and due 
just a month after her daughter.

Jade said: ‘Happy to announce this Granny is going to be a Mummy. I’m six months pregnant — double whammy this year.’

The father of Jade’s baby is graphic designer Adrian Fillary whom she married in June 2012.

Jerry
 felt that Jade needed support from her family because, after a lifetime
 of drama and partying, she had made moves to settle down.

Before
 Adrian, Jade dated DJ Dan Williams for six years and, before him, had a
 fling with American singer-songwriter Pharrell Williams, a romance with
 publishing heir Dan Macmillan and an affair with artist Euan Macdonald.

Assisi and Amba were born 
during her relationship with artist Piers Jackson, with Assisi arriving 
in 1992 when Jade was only 20 years old.

A friend of Jade’s said: ‘Jade has 
been feeling like some people have been weird with her about having 
another baby.

'It is more than a 20‑year gap between children, which is 
unusual. She’s a bit sensitive about everyone’s reaction.’

On
 hearing this, Jerry rallied round. A friend of Jade’s said: ‘Jerry felt
 Mick wasn’t effusive enough and that L’Wren has barely even 
congratulated Jade because she’s been working on her latest design 
collection, so she wanted to do a big in-your-face party for Jade.’

Despite
 not being married to the father of her unborn child, 25-year-old chef 
Alex Key, Assisi is more conventional than her mother.

The couple live 
quietly on the Cornish coast in a converted barn on a cliff-top farm 
overlooking the sea. Assisi is trying to launch a homeopathy business.

LOOK WHO'S BROODY

Kate Moss, who has been friends with Jade for about 20 years, will be the guest of honour at today’s party.

It is a revealing invitation and a chance to heal old wounds.

Jealous Kate? Jade and supermodel Moss earlier this month at Paris Fashion Week

Although
 Kate and Jade were seen socialising earlier this week in Paris at the 
fashion shows, it has not always been such an easy-going friendship.

They fell out in 2003 over Dan Macmillan after it was reported that Kate was seeing him behind Jade’s back.

Jade dumped Dan and he started to date Kate. It took years for the two women to become reconciled. Yet there is still tension.

Kate, now married to rocker Jamie Hince, is desperately envious of Jade’s good fortune in falling pregnant naturally at the age of 42.

Now 40 herself, it would be surprising if Kate has not been trying to get pregnant by Jamie.

She is said to be keener than ever to cement their happiness with a child. Her daughter Lila Grace, by magazine publisher Jefferson Hack, is 11.

guests of honour

Designer Stella McCartney is invited, as are Keith Richards’ model daughters Theodora and Alexandra.

Naturally, Jerry’s brood — Lizzie, 
James, Georgia May and Gabriel — will be there. Ronnie Wood’s offspring 
are also on the list, with TV presenter Fearne Cotton expected to attend
 with Ronnie’s son Jesse, her fiance.

Georgia
 May and Kate Moss will be discreetly kept away from each other. There’s
 no love lost between them since Georgia May succeeded Kate as the face 
of cosmetics house Rimmel in a lucrative contract.

TEA AND FIZZ

The
 food will comprise vegetarian platters, roast beef for the meat-eaters 
and a red velvet cake. Tea and champagne will be served. One thing is 
for certain: the food won’t be cooked by Jerry, who prefers to get 
outside caterers for big occasions and sometimes has a housekeeper for 
the smaller ones, too.

She 
is domestic — she keeps chickens and will potter around the garden 
collecting their eggs — but everything, it seems, has a limit, and 
catering for 40 or so is well above it.

FUN'S COMPULSORY

Guests will not be allowed to just sit around drinking and chatting. Jerry has ordered that all must have fun!

Word is that she is ‘going all out’, with balloons and games based around blue and pink quizzes.

Photographs of Jade as a baby and of Jade’s two girls as babies will be on display.

HELLO! GOODBYE!

Jerry has warned her family and guests that this is a private party and no commercial element should creep in.

It will be held at her £10 million home in Richmond, which she has always regarded as a private sanctuary. It is Jerry’s bolt-hole, a house she was determined to get from Mick when they divorced.

Jade and Assisi are said, however, to have signed magazine deals for after the births of their respective babies.

Hello! is believed to be a strong contender having already covered Jade’s wedding at Aynhoe Park, near Banbury, Oxfordshire.

And the magazine was granted an interview with Assisi, who said: ‘The women in our family just tend to have children young. It runs in the genes.

‘I grew up quite quickly and wouldn’t have considered having a child if I was doing what my friends are doing at this stage, messing around. I don’t drink, I don’t smoke and I’m very settled.’

Assisi said she phoned her Rolling Stone grandfather to tell him she was pregnant. But she picked up vibes that he had mixed feelings about being a great-grandfather.

As Assisi said: ‘I’m not sure he likes the idea of getting old. I call him Mick. I wouldn’t start calling him Grandpa.’
