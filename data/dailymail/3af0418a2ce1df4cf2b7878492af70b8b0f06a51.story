Auction: Art enthusiast Andy Fields who bought a picture he claims is an Andy Warhol original for £3 at a jumble sale has put the drawing up for sale for £1.25million

An art enthusiast who bought a £3 sketch from a jumble sale that could be an original by Andy Warhol has put the drawing up for sale on eBay - with a minimum price of £1.25million.

Andy Fields, 49, was astonished when experts said that one of a handful of unidentified sketches he picked up at a sale in Las Vegas could be a previously unknown picture by the pop art legend from when he was aged 10 or 11.

Although the late 1930s pencil and graphite sketch has been formally valued at £1.3million, Mr Fields says he has been told it could be worth up to ten times that.

He says that if it was an original as claimed, the drawing of singer and actor Rudy Vallee would move the birth of Pop Art back almost two decades and show Warhol was already doing it in childhood.

The Warhol Authentification Board did not officially approve the sketch as Warhol's work before it disbanded but he claims that experts from Bonhams and Sotheby's believe that it is an original piece by the iconic artist.

He says that they are reluctant to speak publicly without authenticity from the Warhol board.

Mr Fields, from Tiverton, Devon, said: 'I've had experts from Sotheby's and Bonhams who are convinced it is original, without a shadow of doubt.

'But without an official authentication boards approval they are reluctant to speak publicly.

'I think it is an incredibly important work which redefines the work of one of the most famous artists of the last 100 years.

'When I first found it I sent it to The Andy Warhol Authentication Board who wrote their unique number in the lower left corner.

Precious: Mr Fields bought the picture in Las Vegas and claims that more than one expert is convinced that it's an original Warhol

Doubt: Questions have been raised about the authenticity of the 1930s drawing because it is signed Andy Warhol and the artist didn't change his name from Warhola until 1949

'They sent it back to me saying they did not have enough evidence to support the fact it could be real.

'I think it's important to note that when they have the slightest doubt about a piece they simply stamp "denied" on it in red letters. This was not the case with this picture.

'Since submitting it to the Authentication Board I have done extensive research to prove beyond all reasonable doubt that it is genuine.

'I am just sad that the Board is no longer authenticating works of Warhol.'

Mr Fields claims the people who ultimately control the Warhol market are reluctant to re-write history and acknowledge what would be Warhol's earliest-known pop art work.

He said: 'These people are so against this particular work being authentic because they simply do not wish to consider changing the facts that have formulated the current version of events Warhol fans have become used to and have no control over a man who has found a lost piece of history.'

Expensive: The sketch hasn't had any bids so far on the auction website

Claims: Mr Fields says that if his picture is authentic it will push the birth date of pop art back a couple of decades

But doubts do remain about the work.

The piece it is signed 'Andy Warhol' and he only changed his name from Andrew Warhola in 1949.

But Mr Fields said he believes it is signed 'Warhol' rather than 'Warhola' because the artist only signed the work many years after he drew it.

'The way the experts have explained it is that Warhol never used to sign his early work,' Mr Fields added.

'When he gave work away many years later it is highly likely he would have been asked to sign it.

Legend: Work by Andy Warhol (left) has sold for as much as £65million. His painting Soup Can (Tomato) sold for £5.6million

He added: 'I am happy to be grilled by any expert in the world.'

Mr Fields picked up the artwork at a sale of property belonging to a man who told him his aunt had been a friend and carer of the sickly young Warhol.

Businessman Mr Fields has put the drawing on eBay with a starting bid of £1.25 million and is inviting serious enquiries only.

In October 2008 Warhol's Eight Elvises painting was sold in a private sale for $100 million (£65million) - a record for his work.

His painting Soup Can (Tomato) sold for £5.6million two years ago - while Lemon Marilyn fetched £17.5million in 2007.
