An 11-year-old boy who was seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombing has come back to the finish line - one day after the city re-opened Boylston Street.

Aaron Hern, of Martinez, California, suffered shrapnel wounds to his legs when the second bomb went off on April 15.

He was at the race with his father, 
Alan, and younger sister, Abby, to cheer on his mother, Katherine, in 
her first Boston Marathon.

On Thursday, Aaron returned to the site of the bombings to revisit the scene of the attacks.

In a particularly emotional moment, 
Aaron's parents helped him out of his wheelchair, where he took a few 
steps at the site of the second bombing.

He had successful surgery last week to close his wounds without the need for skin grafts.

In the days since the bombing, Aaron has had several high profile visitors to his hospital room, including First Lady Michelle Obama.

The
visit came as she and President Obama came to Boston for an interfaith 
service and to visit the hospitalized victims of the twin blasts.

On
Tuesday, he got a visit from baseball players Josh Reddick and Brandon 
Moss of the Oakland Athletics visited an 11-year old boy Monday who was 
injured a week ago in the bombings at the Boston Marathon.

Moss
and Reddick, who both previously played for the Red Sox, were in town 
for the start of a three-game series on Monday night against Boston.

They spent time at Boston’s Children’s 
Hospital, visiting Hern, who is from the Oakland area, and had his left 
leg hit by shrapnel in the bombings.

Oakland manager Bob Melvin talked about how the two players were glad they went and were emotional from the visit.

'I (spoke) with Mossie a little bit,' Melvin said in the dugout, while the players were stretching prior to the game.

'He said that he was very glad and it was a very touching moment, and that the perspective that you get when you’re there talking to someone that's been involved - as opposed to coming out here and losing a baseball game, it’s pretty insignificant - they were glad to do it and they’re probably better for it, too.'

Melvin also discussed how it was when the team was making its way to the hotel Sunday night.

'It was a pretty eerie feeling last night driving up,' Melvin said. 'You look down Boylston Street and it’s still closed, with all the TV trucks and satellite trucks still in the area. You can only imagine what it was like at that time.
