West Ham will return home from their mid-season break in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, but not before a spot of shopping in Dubai.

The Hammers' squad had a week off from Premier League action, and were treated to some sunshine after their topsy-turvy first half of the season.

Sam Allardyce's men started magnificently, hovering around the Champions League places, but have since dropped off with one league win in 2015.

Kouyate has played 25 times for the Hammers since arriving in the summer, and has scored three goals

On their trip, the players have spent time playing tennis and relaxing in the 30 degree heat, and Monday saw them take to the shopping mall for some last-minute spending before they return home. 

Cheikhou Kouyate, who joined the east London club for £7million in the summer, was one of the players in attendance, and he later uploaded a photo to Instagram alongside team-mates Adrian and Enner Valencia.

The trio are posing in front of a waterfall at The Dubai Mall, which boasts an ice rink and an aquarium, as well as stunning views from the top of Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world.

West Ham face Arsenal upon their return to England, before a home game against Sunderland on the following Saturday.
