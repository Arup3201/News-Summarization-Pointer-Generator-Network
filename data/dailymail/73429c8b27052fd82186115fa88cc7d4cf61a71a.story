A Michigan lawmaker has ensured Christians will get fair time in the battle for the holiday season next to a Satanic Temple display on the Statehouse lawn.

State Sen. Rick Jones volunteered to pack the display every night in order to ensure state requirements were met.

'The unveiling of the Nativity display at the Capitol lawn will be at noon Friday,' Jones announced on his Facebook page. 'I have had about 500 offers of help to put up and take down the display. Thank you!'

Jones refused to allow the only display to be from The Satanic Temple, described by Fox News as a loosely organized group that happens to have membership in Detroit. 

A nativity had also been planned but the out-of-state group responsible had to pull out when it discovered it didn't have the resources to ensure the scene could be taken down on for the for the rule against exhibits being shown from 11 p.m. to 6 p.m.

The Temple's goal is not so much to turn people to the devil as it is protesting religious displays on public space. 

Jones also urged people to ignore the Satanic display

'Where there is obstinate refusal to keep religious iconography off of public spaces, the least we can do is ensure that the Government is remaining neutral, respecting a diversity of religious views, with preference for, and exclusion of, none,' said Jex Blackmore, a member of the Satanic Temple's Detroit chapter.

Jones says this battle is far from over. 

'I recommend you simply ignore it,' he says of the Satanic scene. 'They hope for attention. In other states they have won by getting all displays banned. We will not allow them to win in Michigan. They can have their snake and all the darkness it represents.'
