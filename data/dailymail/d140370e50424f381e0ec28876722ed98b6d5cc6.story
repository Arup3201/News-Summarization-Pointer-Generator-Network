Gerald Taylor, 40, brandished a knife after being told by job centre advisors that he would lose his benefits if he did not try harder to find a job

A benefits claimant who has not worked for 25 years trashed a Job Centre and brandished a knife after being told he would lose his payments if he didn't try harder to get a job.

Gerald Taylor, 40, was locked in a 90-minute stand-off with police after  being told his benefits could be axed at Fleetwood Job Centre in Lancashire.

Preston Crown Court heard Taylor was 'aggressive and argumentative' at an appointment on January 26 after advisors raised concerned about his efforts to find employment.

Taylor, from South Shore, Blackpool, threatened that the centre should be torched and stormed out of the building, before returning 45 minutes later with a hammer and smashing two windows.

The jobseeker, whose 59 previous convictions include burglary and arson, was disarmed by a passer-by, but later pulled out the knife as officers arrived at the scene.

Harry Pepper, prosecuting, said: 'He was holding the knife to his wrist.

'When not doing that officers saw he was waving it around and demanding to speak to a Job Centre employee about his benefits.'

The court heard Taylor told police he had been out of work for 25 years due to his lengthy list of convictions and his lack of experience.

David Traynor, defending, said: 'He had no funds to make phone calls to get jobs.

'In the week before this incident he had found five jobs he wanted to apply for, but had no credit or money to make those phone calls.'

Taylor was sentenced to 42 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to threatening behaviour, criminal damage and possessing a bladed article.

Judge Christopher Cornwall told Taylor: 'You are a man with no self control.

'If thwarted as you were, or perceived you were, you react in this wholly unacceptable way.'

The judge added his actions were a 'complete waste of police time' 

'It is a pretty remarkable feature of this case that you held however many police officers at bay for over one and a half hours - a complete waste of police time,' he said.

'Those officers really were not to know just exactly how an unpredictable man was actually going to behave.

'Was he suddenly going to make a run at them or not?'

A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: 'If you are claiming Jobseekers Allowance the rules are that you have got to be available for work and actively looking for work.

'If you don't do that you could be sanctioned. Whether his case is exceptional or not it is almost impossible to say.'
