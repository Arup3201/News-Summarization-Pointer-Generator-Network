U.S. jails are to charge inmates up to $142 per night to stay there in an attempt to balance their budgets.

Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative, the largest so far in America.

Officials have become outraged after watching wealthy celebrities like Lindsay Lohan sent to jail at taxpayers’ expense.

If you do the crime, prepare to do the time... and the dime: Those incarcerated in Riverside County, California, will have to pay for their bed and board under the means tested initiative

They say the fee - which is not far off the $188 for a luxury hotel in the area - is needed to plug an $80million black hole in the county finances.

Riverside prison supervisor Jeff Stone said: ‘You do the crime, you will serve the time, and now you will also pay the dime’.

He estimates that some 25 per cent of the county’s prisoners could be able to to pay something and that it could earn around £4million each year.

Critics have however said it is unlikely to bring in even that much as most prisoners have no cash at all.

Mr Stone said that he put forward the law, which was unanimously passed by the County Board of Supervisors, due to concerns about overcrowding.

Riverside, which is east of Los Angeles, has five jails and stands at 93 per cent capacity, up from 85 per cent in October.

The price of crime: In the UK to house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night

The fee will reimburse the county for of clothing, health care and food.

One issue of concern is that those who stay in county jails do so for an average of two years, meaning for a wealthy prisoner they could end up paying $51,885 per year, or $103,795 for their entire stay.

Mr Stone said: ‘We need to be looking for revenue wherever we can for ourselves.

‘There are people who have the means and who get into trouble with the law. Why should the citizens of this county with other struggles be forced to pay for that? The Lindsay Lohans of the world can certainly pay for it themselves.’

In Britain, the cost of holding an inmate in jail can be even higher than in Riverside County.

Keeping somebody in a police cell - which is done when there is no room at nearby prisons - is a staggering £459 per night.

To house a male category C prisoner costs £28,673 per year, or £78.55 per night.
