It's a royal tradition that began in 1912 but while the Queen, Prince Charles and Camilla have all attended, the younger generation of royals are yet to appear at a Royal Variety Performance.

Now all that is set to change after Kensington Palace announced that the guestlist for next week's show includes the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

Performing on the night are Ed Sheeran, Ellie Goulding, Dame Shirley Bassey and Bette Midler, with comedy coming from Russell Kane and Jack Whitehall.

Attending: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend this year's Royal Variety Performance

On the bill: Award-winning signer Ed Sheeran and comedian Jack Whitehall are both in the line-up

Also on the programme are Demi Lovato, Britain’s Got Talent winners Collabro, the cast of multi-award winning musical Miss Saigon, critically acclaimed tenor Alfie Boe and Ladysmith Black Mambazo’s Inala.

The event, which will take place at the London Palladium, will be hosted by comedian Michael McIntyre.

Traditionally, the Queen has taken it in turns with the Prince of Wales to attend the show and it had been expected to be the Queen’s turn this year.

But instead, William and Kate will take their seats in what royal watchers say is a further sign of the monarch's esteem for her grandson and his wife.

A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: 'The Duke and Duchess are delighted to attend the forthcoming Royal Variety Performance.

Form: Ellie Goulding last performed for royalty when she sang at the closing ceremony of the Invictus Games

Comic: The enormously popular comedian Michael McIntyre will be acting as compère on the night

Last visit: The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh last attended the Royal Variety Performance in 2012

'Members of the Royal Family will continue to support the gala evenings. As with any other invitation, attendance by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will be assessed on a case-by-case basis.'

The Queen, who has a busy November schedule that includes regular audiences and investitures, will continue to take part in other big public events, including this weekend's Remembrance Sunday commemorations.

Last year saw the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall take their seats in the royal box with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh doing the honours in 2012, although the Princess Royal did the job in 2011.

The Royal Variety Performance is held in aid of the Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, of which the Queen is patron.

Begun in 1912, the first show was held in front of King George V and Queen Mary at the Palace Theatre in London.

In July 1919, a second royal show was performed, again in front of the royal couple, and was billed as a post-war celebration of peace.

It became an annual event at the suggestion of George V in 1921, when the King decreed that 'the monarch, or a representative of the monarch, would attend an annual performance in aid of Brinsworth House and the Variety Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, once a year thereafter'.

The show will be screened on ITV in December.
