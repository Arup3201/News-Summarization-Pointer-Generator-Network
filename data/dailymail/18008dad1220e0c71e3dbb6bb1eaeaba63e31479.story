When you spend your days running up and down trees and hunting for nuts, it is important that you get your stretches done properly.

This squirrel appears to have taken the advice to heart as it was caught 'doing yoga' in a park in Lyon, France.

The ginger climber can be seen stretching high towards the sky - and even practicing some 'anti-gravity yoga' from a tree trunk.

Going nuts: The adorable squirrel stretches out on a tree trunk during a snack break in Lyon, France

Reaching for the stars: The energetic little rodent made sure he got his sun salutation right

Stretch and pull: The squirrel has come up with his own version of anti-gravity yoga, preferring to dig his claws into a tree rather than hang from the ceiling in a hammock

Photographer Thanh Ha Bui, who captured the image in his home city of Lyon, France, said: ‘It's uncommon.’

The
 red squirrel also demonstrated its acrobatic skills leaping between 
trees, and attempted to grab a woman's handbag as she walked through the
 park.

But it later came over all shy, burying its head in its hands and tucking it towards its chest as it sat on a tree branch.

Thanh said locals often visit Parc de la Tete d'Or to feed the squirrels.

Yoga-t to be kidding me: You might think this is just the squirrel curling up into a ball - but as a matter for fact, he is prepping for his cat pose

Drop it like its hot: There is no stopping the squirrel now, as he heads down the tree trunk in full speed

Dinner time: After all that exercise, the squirrel has a well-deserved nut

He added: ‘For many years I have developed a passion about squirrels, especially the red squirrel of Europe.

‘Fortunately, I have had the chance and the opportunity to observe them not very far from my place.

‘I
 am not the only one to know about this special place. There are quite a
 few people who come regularly to bring them some food.

‘Everytime I go there I ask these people what they know about squirrels and I get to hear many interesting stories and legends.

‘I learned about their morphology, behaviors and movement patterns.

‘I became completely fascinated with the squirrels. I enjoy observing them and taking original shots.’
