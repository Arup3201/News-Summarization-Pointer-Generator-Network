Life imprisonment: Muhammad Shafi has been for a minimum of 23 years after he was found guilty of bludgeoning his wife to death

A newlywed who bludgeoned his Thai bride to death in an underpass after she questioned his sexuality has been jailed for life.

Muhammad Shafi took a pair of 
metal tin cutters and struck Tuanjai Sprengel nine 
times over her head just five months after they got married.

The 28-year-old defendant claimed he was branded homosexual by his wife, who also taunted him that she had slept with other men in a heated argument in which she attempted to walk away from their relationship.

The pair had been arguing for more than a hour in the underpass in Bracknell, Berkshire, when  he armed himself and beat her to death.

After the bloody killing, Shafi calmly 
picked up the improvised weapon and threw it in some bushes as he walked
back to their rented home.

A jury at Reading Crown Court heard how he cried in his bedroom as he sat in his bloodstained clothes, which he later tried to unsuccessfully hide with friends.

Shafi tried to convince the jury that he 
could not remember inflicting the fatal blows on his 43-year-old bride, who was
known to friends as 'Tuk.'

The Pakistani national, who married mother-of-one 
Tuk in an Islamic marriage in December last year, admitted hitting 
her once in self-defence, claiming she had pulled a kitchen knife and the tin cutters 
on him.

However, prosecutor Alan Blake 
rejected this account and maintained Shafi had taken the weapons to an 
underpass in order to kill her.

Amjad Malik QC, defending, told the judge: 'It was a violent and sudden loss of temper.

'This is a man with no previous convictions. He is emotionally naive and emotionally weak for a 28-year-old man.'

Speaking of the homosexual 
allegations made by Tuk, the defendant told the jury during 
the hearing: 'She was my wife and I loved her very much and I did not 
expect it from her. I had opposed all my family to marry her.

'I’m a Muslim. As a Muslim, in my religion, there is not gay (people). In my culture people hurt these people.'

Of the adulterous affairs, a tearful Shafi said: 'She didn’t say who, but she said she had sex with different men.'

Days before her tragic death, Tuk 
confided in a pal that Shafi had asked her to have a threesome with him 
and that he had become enraged when she refused.

Shafi, who was in the UK on a student visa, has refuted any suggestion of this ever happening, the jury was told

Shafi denied murdering Tuk in the 
pedestrian subway at about 4am on May 27 but was unanimously found guilty after three hours and 11 minutes and was sentenced to sentenced to a minimum of 
23 years.

Addressing Shafi, Judge Zoe Smith said: 'You killed her in a brutal manner.

'One cannot ignore the severity of violence used on a woman who sought to defend herself.

'What was in your mind as you left the house with the weapons only you know.

'One thing is clear. Had you managed to persuade her to return to the house she may have lived.'
