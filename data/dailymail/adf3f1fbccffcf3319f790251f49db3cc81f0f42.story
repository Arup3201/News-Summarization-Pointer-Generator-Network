The shocking failure of the Government to live up to its promise to restore weekly bin collections is laid bare today.

Families are having to wait 12 days on average to have general rubbish collected – and face spiralling charges for extra waste-removal services, it has been revealed.

This comes despite the Conservatives’ repeated pledge that they would restore people’s ‘fundamental right’ to have their bins emptied once a week.

Figures from a comprehensive survey suggest that just 6 per cent of local authorities in England collect all bins weekly.

And there is a creeping trend for councils to issue fees for basic services such as garden waste collection, garden rubbish bags and the disposal of bulky waste – with increases of almost 5,000 per cent in the worst-hit areas.

Overall, families now have to wait one week and five days on average for black bag rubbish to be collected and have to contend with an average of nearly four bins, according to figures gathered from Freedom of Information requests to every council in the country.

Shadow communities and local government secretary Hilary Benn said the findings meant boasts by ministers that they would restore weekly bin collections had been exposed as ‘pompous hot air’.

Once-a-week household rubbish collections came into law in 1875. But after Labour’s 1997 election victory local authorities were encouraged to move towards alternate collections of general and recyclable waste.

In opposition, David Cameron and Communities Secretary Eric Pickles repeatedly pledged to restore the weekly bin round, and on winning power unveiled a £250million fund to encourage councils to do so.

Today’s research, however, suggests the Government’s measures have been a crushing failure. It involved Freedom of Information requests to all 325 councils responsible for waste collection, of which nearly nine in ten responded.

It found that only 17 of 285 authorities collect all bins weekly – covering 4.3million people. The 48.7million living in the other 268 areas have bins collected less-frequently.

On average, general waste bins are now collected every once every 12 days, while recycling bins are collected every 13 days. Food waste, collected separately in 116 areas, is picked up on average every nine days. Garden waste is collected every 13 days.

And the survey showed that while in 2011/12, councils across England made £36.2million from extra charges – for services such as garden waste collection, extra waste bags and bulky waste collection – by last year, the figure had risen to £54.3million.

The biggest charges are in Purbeck, Dorset, where residents have to pay £40 a year for fortnightly collections of a wheeled bin containing garden waste. There are also now charges for collection and disposal of bulky waste – £30 for a single item followed by £6 per subsequent item.

In 2011/12, the council earned £101,802.19 from such charges, but by last year, the figure spiralled to £869,796.79, the survey revealed.

North Kesteven, Lincolnshire, has seen the biggest increase in revenues – up 4,676 per cent to £750,283 over the same period. Its garden waste charge for 2014/15 is £25 per bin, while bulky collections are charged at £11 for up to three items and £22 for up to six items.

Mr Benn said: ‘This comprehensive study fatally undermines Eric Pickles’ boast when he was in opposition and in government that he would return Britain to weekly bin collections and keep extra charges down.

'The reality that we expose today is very different. It is Tory councils that are charging the most – three times as much as Labour councils – and there was a 50 per cent increase in charges across England in the last two years.

‘He said the public should hold him to account for his record so as we approach the general election I hope people will recognise that he made claims he never had the power to bring to fruition.’

He added: ‘Eric Pickles blustered for years that he would impose new controls on local authorities and local communities but this has now been exposed as pompous hot air. This is precisely why people have lost faith in politics. You need to say what you mean and mean what you say. Eric Pickles does neither.’

Government sources said Labour’s analysis was misleading, since it counted garden waste as something that should be collected weekly, when that has never been the case in most places. 

Fourteen million homes in England still have weekly collection of smelly rubbish ‘in some form’, the Government insists.

Mr Pickles said: ‘The Labour Government bullied councils into axing weekly collections and were planning new bin taxes on family homes.

'Conservatives in Government have kept to our promises; we have abolished Labour’s bin taxes, reined back in bin snoopers and have actively supported weekly collections, whilst keeping council tax down.’

He also insisted he had changed the law to scrap unfair fines for not putting rubbish out correctly.

The Government is considering introducing new laws to force more councils to bring back weekly bin collections. Mr Pickles said it had taken Labour ten years to ‘destroy’ the traditional weekly service and suggested it would take as long to restore it.

A spokesperson for Adur and Worthing Councils has asked us to clarify that, because figures supplied to the Labour Party for this report were an amalgamation of costs for two councils' households rather than simply for Adur households, the average household charge relating to ancillary, elective, waste collections services for households in Adur and Worthing is in fact £9.75 rather than the figure of £26.81 as calculated by the survey's researchers. We are happy to set the record straight.

We have been asked by Purbeck District Council to make clear that while the article states that Purbeck, Dorset is the area with the highest charges for waste collection services, in fact its service charges are lower than those of many other local authorities. The discrepancy arose because the response to the Freedom of Information request, on which the survey was based, came from Purbeck Council rather than Dorset Waste Partnership, which administers the service to six district and borough council areas not just Purbeck District Council.
