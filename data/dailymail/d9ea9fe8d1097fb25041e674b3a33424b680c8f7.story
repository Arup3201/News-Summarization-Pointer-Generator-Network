Multimillionaire Tumblr founder ­David Karp has split with his girlfriend of five years.

The 28-year-old whiz kid started dating psychology graduate student and trained chef Rachel Eakley in 2009 but the couple broke up at the end of 2014, it has emerged.

The low-key couple, who lived together in a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn with their French-English Bulldog, were quiet about the breakup - but Eakley spoke about it briefly on her Tumblr page.

She posted a message from another user remarking on the split, PageSix reported.

'They really suck, right?' the user wrote. 'And you built a house together, and probably got left with nothing since you weren't married...

'Maybe it's better to hear someone agree that it sucks instead of someone telling you time heals all wounds blah blah blah?'

Eakley responded to the message, calling it 'sweet and strange'.

'I don't really know what to say when I get stuff like this, so I mostly ignore it,' she wrote. 'You guys are cute. It's sweet that you worry about me and I think it's the best thing about Tumblr.

'I've been being purposefully quiet on this matter and will continue to be. I never really shared much about my relationships and probably won't start any time soon. Mine is more of a school's hard, tv's awesome, look at this food! kind of blog.' 

Karp, who grew up in the Bronx, New York, dropped out of high-school at age 14 to focus on computers - on his mother's advice, the New York Times reported.

He founded Tumblr, a microblogging website with an estimated 17 million users, in 2007.

In 2009, he started dating Eakley, a graduate student at NYU, according to the Times. 

In 2013, he sold his company for $1.1 billion to Yahoo! under CEO Marissa Meyer. He is worth an estimated $200 million, according to Forbes.

At the time, Karp told PageSix: 'I don't even know how much money it is. I swear, I ­haven't given it a moment of thought.'

Karp, who turns up to press conferences and television appearances wearing shirts, jeans and hoodies, has previously spoken about his modest lifestyle - while denying he is a 'hipster'.

He previously shared a small West Village apartment with Eakley but in 2012, they moved to a $1.6 million loft in south Williamsburg.

The 1,700-square-foot duplex was featured in the New York Times' T Magazine.

He explained how he didn't like seeing screens anywhere inside the home so kept it simple with one TV and a couch. The central feature of the modern home was a restaurant-grade kitchen for Eakley.

They also told the magazine how they liked to take their Vespa to brunch at the weekends.

He told the Times that he looks forward to philanthropic endeavors in the future - and joked that he should finally be able to afford to go to college.
