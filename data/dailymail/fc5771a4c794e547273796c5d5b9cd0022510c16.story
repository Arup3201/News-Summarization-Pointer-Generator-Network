More than 20 beaches in England are expected to fail cleanliness tests when tougher European standards are introduced next year, new figures show.

Almost all beaches in England (99.5 per cent) currently meet the basic standards for clean bathing water, but that figure is expected to drop to 94.5 per cent once the rules change.

Just two spots failed to reach the mandatory grade this year – Lyme Regis Church Cliff Beach in Dorset and Staithes in North Yorkshire.

Staithes, North Yorkshire was one of two spots that failed to reach the mandatory grade this year

The other spot that failed to make the grade in 2014 was Lyme Regis Church Cliff Beach in Dorset

But five per cent of beaches which are currently meeting the minimum standards will be classed as ‘poor’ next year, including Blackpool North, Blackpool Central, Lancashire and Seaton and East Looe in Cornwall.

The UK government said some areas remain vulnerable to the effects of heavy rainfall and pollution from human and animal sources.

The bathing water statistics from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) showed the number of beaches which reached mandatory levels for cleanliness increased from 98.8 per cent in 2013 to 99.5 per cent this year in England.

In Northern Ireland 95.7 per cent of all beaches tested met the mandatory level of cleanliness

Water minister Dan Rogerson said: 'Water quality is improving and has now reached a record high, which means families across the country can make the most of what nature has to offer.

'We know that seaside tourism is hugely valuable to the economy, contributing over £3.6 billion every year. That is why it is so important to protect our seas and lakes, allowing our seaside communities to thrive.

'We know meeting the tough new targets is going to be a challenge but that is why we are doing everything we can to help prepare. Everyone has an important role to play, from a range of sectors to local government and the communities they represent.'

New figures show that 97.5 per cent of bathing spots in Scotland passed water quality tests

In Wales all beaches tested met the mandatory level of cleanliness, while 97.5 per cent of those in Scotland passed bathing water tests and 95.7 per cent in Northern Ireland made the grade.

The figures also showed that the proportion of beaches reaching existing higher guideline standards of cleanliness fell slightly in 2014.

In England, 80.7 per cent of beaches met the higher grade, a slight drop from 83.5 per cent in 2013.

Dr Paul Leinster, chief executive of the Environment Agency, said: ‘This year a record 99.5 per cent of beaches passed bathing water quality tests, a dramatic improvement in water quality since 1988 when only 65 per cent of beaches passed.

‘Successful work with our partners to reduce pollution has benefited the environment and people.

‘While 94.5 per cent of beaches would pass the new tougher water quality standards the Environment Agency will continue to urge water companies, local authorities, farmers and businesses to take steps to reduce pollution and protect water quality where improvements are needed.’ 

In Wales 88.1 per cent of bathing spots achieved the higher standards, as did 55.6 per cent in Scotland and 69.6 per cent in Northern Ireland – where it fell from 87 per cent the previous year.

In Wales all 101 beaches tested met the mandatory water standards, and 89 also made the higher grade.

Carl Sargeant, Welsh minister for natural resources, said: ‘Our bathing waters are an important natural resource that has environmental, social and economic benefits for the whole of Wales, with our fantastic beaches and beautiful coastlines enjoyed by millions every year.

‘I'm delighted to see Wales achieve these excellent results for the 2014 bathing season.

'We must now continue to work with our partners to build on the high standards we have set so that communities across Wales and beyond can continue to bathe in top quality Welsh water for years to come.’
