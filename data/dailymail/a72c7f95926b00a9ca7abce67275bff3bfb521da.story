Yankees bosses are standing by their scandal hit general manager Brian Cashman as his embarrassing stalking case continues to make headlines.

The father-of-two, who is facing a divorce after his alleged stalker claimed they had an affair and he got her pregnant, has also vowed to not let his personal problems 'affect his job'.

Speaking at a press conference held at the New York team's training camp in Tampa, Cashman attempted to focus on baseball, reports the New York Post. 

However, he admitted to reporters that the last few weeks of his life have been 'difficult' but said he  would remain focused on his job even as the details of his struggles at home are aired in public.

A sad state of affairs: Looking tired and unhappy, Brian Cashman drives away from his house in Norwalk, Connecticut on Saturday

Louise Neathway, pictured right in court, claimed that Yankess boss 
Brian Cashman, left, got her pregnant and made her have an abortion

'I have a professional life and a 
personal life, and I will continue to do the job to the best of my 
ability like I always have,' he said, according to the Post.

Cashman moved out of the family mansion after Louise Neathway, 36, was charged with stalking and harassing him.

The case has revealed a long list of 
embarrassing claims from Neathway, who has a history of harassment, who
said she had a lengthy affair with the 44-year-old and he forced her to
have an abortion after she got pregnant. 

Cashman refused to answer questions on his future with the Yankees

'Those answers are for somebody else. It's not going to affect my job. Out of respect for others, I don't want to speak for anybody else.'

Yankee officials have said that Cashman is '100% totally supported' by the team, reports the Post.

Neathway allegedly bombarded Cashman 
with emails and even attached an ultrasound scan of their alleged unborn
to one of the messages.

The trove of emails sent to Cashman 
and his lawyer by Neathway, who claims she had an affair with the  
father-of-two and allegedly blackmailed him for $6,000, were obtained by the New York Daily News.

Prior accusations: Cashman is not the first man to accuse her of stalking and making threats

'What Brian Cashman has done to me is 
both incomprehensible and unforgivable,' Neathway reportedly wrote in an email 
sent with the scan on January 29.

'I am going to the press and 
informaing [sic] them of the preganacy [sic] and the abortion. And 
everything else,' she writes typo littered message, reports the Daily 
News.

'So you can have a 
little gloat at my agony here is my ultra sound picture. . . I guess its
ok for me to just push this aside right? Men!!!'

Neathway,
in a separate email sent a day later, threatened to make Cashman’s life
hell unless he paid for her 'abortion'. She also warned that any 
threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British 
intelligence agency MI6.

'I will not tolerate threats by any means, of a criminal nature, as that will bite Brian in the backside and probably will be the biggest personal mistake of his life,' wrote the mother-of-one, reports the Daily News.

His wife Mary, 42, filed for divorce a 
day after Neathway faced her charges in court earlier this month claiming to have had an
affair with the father-of-two.

Cashman is the latest in a line of men 
who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking 
and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former 
friends claim, according to the Post.

Yankees boss Brian Cashman's wife has filed for a divorce after he was publicly accused of the affair with Neathway

He emerged in public last Saturday for the first time since his wife submitted the divorce papers after the humiliating claims he had an affair with his accused 'crazed stalker'.

Scruffily dressed, he visited the 
family’s $3.7 million Darien mansion where his wife has been living 
apart in the wake of the allegations - but he spent less than a minute 
inside, reports the New York Post.

Mrs Cashman had said the marriage had 'broken down irretrievably'.

She is seeking permanent alimony, half of their property and joint custody of their two children, reports the New York Post.

Extra threat: Neathway warned Cashman in her last email that any threats against her would backfire claiming she worked for British intelligence agency MI6

Mrs Cashman, who endured the humiliation of an affair her husband had back in 2009, has been living apart from him in the family home with her daughter and son, sources told the Post. 

British native Neathway, also known as Louise Meanwell, was arrested on Wednesday and is facing charges of grand larceny, stalking and harassment.

On Thursday prosecutors said Neathway harassed Cashman with hundreds of text messages, and demanded he give her $15,000 to pay for an unspecified medical procedure.

She allegedly threatened to contact the press and his family with claims that would hurt his personal relationships and professional standing, according to a court complaint.

Cashman made two payments, one for $4,000 and another for $2,000.

In a series of shocking emails to Cashman, Louise Neathway, 36, pictured in court on Thursday, reportedly threatened to tell the world he got her pregnant

He even tried to get rid of his alleged mistress by urging her mother to have her committed, sources told the Daily News.

He contacted Caroline Meanwell last week and told her that her daughter was mentally unstable and 'needs help', the sources said.

The call led to a meeting between Meanwell, Cashman and his lawyer.

'He told the mother she needed help,' one of the sources told the Daily News. 'He suggested to her that she try to have her committed'

In a meeting on January 27, Cashman and Meanwell placed a conference call to Louise’s Manhattan psychiatrist, Charlotte Murphy, who agreed with Cashman, sources told the Post said. 

'Murphy agreed that Louise was dangerous and violent, and that it was a serious situation. She said to call 911,' a  source told the Post.

Second sting: Cashman's wife has since filed for divorce requesting joint custody of their two children and share in their $3.7 million Darien mansion with this latest sting being his second affair during their marriage

Meanwell made the call which eventually led to her daughter's arrest.

The Daily News also obtained a reference letter Cashman wrote for Neathway on Yankees letterhead.

In
the letter dated July 15, 2011, Cashman said that he has known her for 
six years through charity work and describes her as 'tireless' 
contributor who has the 'respect and admiration' of her colleagues.

In court Neathway's lawyers said Mr Cashman was 'a 
married man having an inappropriate relationship' with Neathway, a 
medical sales worker, and he
turned on her when it 'ended badly'

Neathway’s lawyers claim their client is the real victim of a romance that 
began in April and 'ended badly.'

She
is also reported by the Post to have claimed to several friends that 
she had a year long affair with Cashman which she ended after he did not
fulfill a promise to leave his wife.

Mr Cashman claims he was stalked and blackmailed into handing over $6,000 to Louise Neathway

Neathway has a criminal history of harassment and trespassing going back to 1988 and spanning three states.

She has allegedly been harassing her ex-husband Jason Bump, their daughter and a long line of boyfriends she’s had since her marriage broke up, reports the Post.

'She’s a very dangerous person. She’s a psychopath, in my estimation,' Mr Bump, told The Post.

'There’s currently an order of protection for myself, my daughter, my wife and my mother' against her.

'She has not seen our daughter in a few years, and she’s not allowed to contact her at all,' he said reports the Post.

Cashman is the latest in a line of men who claim Neathway has tormented them with death threats, phone hacking and lies about miscarriages and abortions, court records and former friends claim, according to the Post.

In 2010 a former lover, who works on Wall Street, told the police that 'she has made many threatening statements aimed at me and has been e-mailing and phoning me constantly.

'She’s also begun waiting outside my apartment in the East Village,' court records said according to the Post.

'I am fearful for my safety and have no idea what this woman is capable of. As of this morning, she has hacked into my personal e-mail account and my Facebook account, deleting all my e-mails. I am VERY scared of her.' he ex-fling said.

Neathway also has two open upstate warrants for harassment, and is on probation for stalking in New Jersey, reports the Daily News.

Mrs Cashman served her husband with divorce papers on January 31, the day before Neathway was arrested, reports the Post. The documents were filed in court on Friday.

She previously stood by her husband as he was romantically linked to a Westchester mother-of-two, Kim Brennan.

A spokesman for Brian Cashman declined a request from the Post to comment on the divorce filing.
