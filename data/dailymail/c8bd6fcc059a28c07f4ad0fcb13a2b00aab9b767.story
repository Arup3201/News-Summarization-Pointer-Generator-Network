Two parents turned their sons over to police after recognizing them in footage of an electronics store burglary which showed a group of five teens helping themselves to stacks of cell phones and laptops.

The mom and dad - who have not been named - took their 14- and 16-year-old children to the police station in Fayetteville, North Carolina, after watching a news broadcast that featured the crime.

Footage of a group of five boys wearing tracksuits and hooded sweaters showed the 3.30am robbery of an independent store called Tech Boyz on December 29.

Burglary: The parents recognized their own sons in footage of five boys robbing an electronics store in Fayetteville, North Carolina

Busted: The 14- and 16-year old were supposed to be staying with an older sibling the night of the crime. It is not clear which they are in the footage

On their way: The youths were caught by as many as nine cameras, both outside the store and inside

Charges: The boys have been charged with larceny, breaking and entering and possession of stolen goods

The parents had thought their sons were spending the night with an older sibling - but realized what they had really been up to when they saw the surveillance footage, shown by ABC11.

They were caught by as many as nine different cameras walking up to piles of laptops and other electronics stacked on the shelves of the store - many of which had been brought in by customers to be repaired.

They seemingly forced their way into the store, and are filmed walking causally through it, then running away.

The parents were at church when the footage first aired, but had recorded ABC11's news program and watched it back the next day.

After they were marched to the Fayetteville police station, the boys were charged with charges including breaking and entering, larceny and possession of stolen goods.

Others: Police also arrested a 17-year-old, and say they are on the cusp of finding the other two suspects

Raided: The store targeted was Tech Boyz in Fayetteville, from which laptops and cell phones were taken - some of which had been brought in by customers for repair

Owner: Jesse Hill thanked the parents for turning their sons in

Because of their ages, the two will go to a juvenile court. According to police, they said the burglary was not their idea and they went along with it due to peer pressure.

Another boy, aged 17, was also arrested, while officers say they are closed to identifying the other two people filmed as part of the robbery.

Jesse Hill, the co-owner of Tech Boyz, told the news station: 'To the [parents] who turned them in, thank you. I'm hating that it's your kids, but thank you for doing the right thing.'
