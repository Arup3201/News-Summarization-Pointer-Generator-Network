For the second time this year France manager Didier Deschamps has been on the receiving end of abuse from the partner of a player he has not picked for the French squad.

Back in May Deschamps did not include Samir Nasri in his World Cup squad, leading his girlfriend Anara Atanes to tweet, 'F*** France and f*** Deschamps! What a s*** manager!' 

And now the 45-year-old former Monaco boss has incurred the wrath of Noemie Jourdren, the wife of Montpellier goalkeeper Geoffrey Jourdren, who Deschamps has not included in his France squad for the friendlies against  Portugal and Armenia.

France manager Deschamps answered questions from the media on Monday ahead of his side's friendlies against Portugal and Armenia

Mrs Jourdren took to Facebook to vent her anger and said: 'Deschamp (sic) I hope that you die tomorrow.’  

It is believed that the post was in response to Deschamps' decision to replace Saint-Etienne stopper Stephane Ruffier, who pulled out of the squad, with Rennes’ goalkeeper Benoit Costil.

The failure of Mrs Jourdren to spell Deschamps' name correctly only added to the ludicrous nature of the post, and the national team manager must be dreading the next time he has to pick a Les Bleus squad.
