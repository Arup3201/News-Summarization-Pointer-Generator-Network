The family of murdered honeymooner Anni Dewani said they were ‘one step closer’ to justice last night as her husband was finally extradited to South Africa.

Millionaire British businessman Shrien Dewani will this morning appear in court in Cape Town where he will face allegations that he ordered the killing of his 28-year-old wife in November 2010.

The 33-year-old from Bristol had engaged in a marathon legal battle to block extradition claiming he was unwell, but last night he was flown out of the city’s airport.

Extradition: The millionaire British businessman had fought extradition for three-and-a-half years following the death of his wife, Anni, in November 2010. Above, Dewani was flown to Cape Town in this plane tonight

Flight: But he was flown from Britain to Cape Town at around 8pm to face charges that he ordered the killing of his 28-year-old Swedish partner. Above, the plane prepares for take-off

Dewani, a care home owner, was 
extradited at around 8pm and will arrive in Cape Town this morning, 
where he will be whisked straight to a brief court hearing to be 
formally charged.

Newlywed Anni Dewani was shot as the couple travelled 
in a taxi near a township on the outskirts of Cape Town during their 
honeymoon.

Her family last 
night spoke of their relief to see Dewani being sent to South Africa to 
face the allegations about his wife’s death, saying they have endured a 
‘nightmare’ over the past three years.

Her
 brother Anish Hindocha said: ‘Tonight we finally see him being sent on 
that flight and that is one step closer to finding out what happened to 
Anni and why, so it is a relief for us.

‘I
 would say I’m happy. I’m delighted this trial is one step forward. Anni
 is not at peace now and we’re not in peace – that is why we need 
this … We can’t move on with our lives.’

Revelation: Dewani is pictured with his wife, Anni. South African police say he ordered the killing as he was gay and wanted out of the marriage

Concern: His extradition comes as Mrs Dewani's brother, Anish Hindocha (pictured with Anni's uncle, Ashok Hindocha), has said there are 'so many different' questions to be answered over his sister's death

Mr
 Hindocha, who wore a photograph of his sister decorated with pink 
ribbons as he spoke at a press conference in London, broke down in tears
 as he added:

‘Sometimes I call my father at four or five in the morning
 and he’s awake – he can’t sleep, I can’t sleep, it’s all we’re thinking
 about.’

It is understood that Dewani could stand trial in September if 
he is found fit to do so.

Mr Hindocha said the family will be there as they want Dewani to stand before them and explain what happened.

He
 said: ‘The family will be there when the trial starts. I have not seen 
him in a long time, since the funeral, so I cannot say how I will feel.

'But he needs to step up and he needs to answer what happened … We need 
the closure on this case in order for us to start the grieving process 
for Anni.’

He is due to fly tonight from London, expected to be formally charged for the murder of his wife tomorrow

He has said 'it has been very difficult for my family... There are so many questions we need answers to'

Mrs Dewani’s 
uncle, Ashok Hindocha, added: ‘From today and onwards this case will be 
about Anni. Until now it hasn’t been about what really happened to 
her … Obviously we were extremely surprised that it took such a long 
time.’

Three men have already been convicted and jailed over Mrs 
Dewani’s death, including taxi driver Zola Tongo, Xolile Mngeni, who 
prosecutors claim was the hitman, and Mziwamadoda Qwabe.

Dewani’s
 lawyers argued he should not be forced from the UK to face trial until 
he had recovered from mental health problems, including depression and 
post-traumatic stress disorder.

But
 last month High Court judges rejected all his grounds for appeal 
against removal and denied him the chance to take the case to the 
Supreme Court.

If he is not fit to stand trial within 18 months he will be returned to the UK.

Dewani,
 who denies murder, will be accompanied by a doctor, nurse and police 
officers on his journey before being taken to Western Cape High Court.

Anger: Vinod Hindocha (right), the father of 
murdered bride Anni Dewani (left with murder suspect Shrien), said he 
had always questioned how genuine his son-in-law's mental illness could 
have been

Claims: Prosecutors claim Dewani hired a hitman to kill his wife, which Dewani has consistently denied

Secure: The Valkenberg psychiatric hospital in Cape Town, where Shrien Dewani will be assessed to see if he is mentally fit to stand trial for allegedly organising the honeymoon murder of his wife Anni

Guilty: Taxi driver Zola Tongo (pictured) was jailed for 18 years after he admitted his part in the killing
