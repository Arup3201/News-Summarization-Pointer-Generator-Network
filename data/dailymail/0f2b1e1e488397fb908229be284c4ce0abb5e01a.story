Police have found no human remains in a suburban garden where it was claimed a war veteran was involved in the killing of a woman more than 50 years ago.

Forensic teams descended on the former home of Second World War RAF navigator Ronald Newell yesterday after one of his nine children claimed a woman called Laura had been buried there in the late 1950s.

But relatives of Mr Newell insisted yesterday that the tip-off was a mistake and that police were wasting their time.

This morning police confirmed no human remains had been found and said they believed the information was genuine.

Digging for clues: Detectives hunting for human remains yesterday of a young woman who may have disappeared more than 50 years ago - but today they said they found nothing

Detective Inspector Lee Whitehead from Kent Police said: 'The search of the garden in 
Rankine Road has been completed and no human remains have been found.

'I 
would very much like to thank the local residents from Rankine Road and 
the surrounding area, for their co-operation and patience while we 
carried out this essential investigative work.'

Mr Newell, who worked as a bus driver 
after the war, lived in the semi-detached house in Tunbridge Wells, 
Kent, until he died aged 60 in 1981. The house has changed hands several
 times since.

Moved out: The family currently living at the property had to abandon their home during the search which ended today

One of Mr Newell’s children, Linda 
Paintain, 58, told the Daily Mail last night that her sister Carol 
Pennells, 66, went to the police claiming that her father and a group of
 friends had been involved in the death of a young woman named only as 
Laura. But Mrs Paintain and another sibling insisted their sister was 
mistaken.

Mrs Paintain, of East Farleigh, Kent, said: ‘My dad was quite a soft man. I can only remember him smacking me once.’

Her brother John Newell, 50, who lives
 opposite the house that was searched, said yesterday: ‘The police are wasting their 
time. There is no body.’

The force would not reveal how much the operation cost but said costs were kept to a minimum.

A spokesman said the investigation had now been closed added: 'The information we
 received was credible and corroborated by a number of people and we had
 a very specific location.'

Before the search was concluded a Kent Police source said: 
‘Clearly we would not take such a drastic step as this type of search 
unless we believed the information was credible.’

The family currently living at the house have had to abandon their home for the duration of the search.

Major investigation: The current residents have no connection to the investigation and are not suspects

Police yesterday stressed the current residents
 have no connection to the investigation and are not suspected of 
committing any crime as the property has changed hands several times 
since the 1950s.

Officers were in the adjoining house's garden as they hunted for the body.

Detectives were secretive about the 
source of the tip-off but a spokesman for Kent Police confirmed it does 
not relate to any other past or current cases.

However, paperwork dating back to the
 period when the woman died was said to be well below today's high 
standards making work difficult for anyone trying to trace missing 
person records.

The excavation work follows a tip-off suggesting a body has been buried at the three-bedroom, semi-detached home on this quiet suburban street since the 1950s

Two large white tents filled the 
triangular garden of the house where police believed the human remains 
had sat below the soil for around 60 years.

Inside a forensic science team spent the day carrying out careful excavation-work, digging through the soil looking for bones.

Officers in white overalls, lilac 
gloves and hairnets worked busily in an area up several wooden stairs at
 the end of the garden, behind a brick, tiled-roof shed.

However, the white and blue 
tarpaulin, pulled tight around the grassy area, hid their painstaking 
work from neighbours in the surrounding tree-lined gardens.

Soil removed from the yard was packed
 into black dustbins stored alongside the two tents, during the 
meticulously-planned operation.

Eighteen police vehicles were also parked outside and uniformed officers kept a constant presence in the suburban street.

A mobile police station parked further down the hill was set up to allow anyone with information access to officers.
