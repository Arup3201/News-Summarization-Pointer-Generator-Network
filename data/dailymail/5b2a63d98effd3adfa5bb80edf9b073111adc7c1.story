Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner didn’t attend Wembley on Sunday after his aunt passed away.

The 53-year-old American had been tipped to make a rare appearance but boss Tim Sherwood said: ‘I’ve not spoken to him yet. My phone is buzzing in my pocket but I don’t know who it is.

‘He’s had a family bereavement so I’m not sure if he could make it. I spoke to him in the week. If he’s not here in body he’s certainly here in spirit. He’s the biggest Aston Villa fan I know.’

Aston Villa owner Randy Lerner is rarely seen at the club's games, but was expected to appear at Wembley

Lerner has been publicly trying to sell Villa since last May, and is hopeful of concluding a deal worth around £150million once the season is finished.

Villa put in an excellent display to upset Liverpool at Wembley and reach their first FA Cup final since Lerner bought the club.

Philippe Coutinho's deflected shot had put Liverpool ahead but goals from Christian Benteke and Fabian Delph saw Sherwood's side bounce back to reach the final
