Ronny Deila has spent 38 years clinging to the notion mother knows best. Clutching a green and white shirt in the Number Seven Suite at Celtic Park it was time for a rethink. 

A qualified teacher, the Norwegian dovetailed his career as a defender at Odd Grenland with a full-time education. The assumption was the football would never amount to anything.

‘My mother said that I could never make a living from football,’ he explained. ‘So I needed an education.

Up for the challenge: Newly-appointed Celtic manager Ronny Deila speaks during a press conference

‘She finally said to me when I was coming here yesterday “okay, I was wrong…"'

His mother is not alone in being confounded by her son’s appointment as the 18th manager of Celtic. 

Former
 coach of unfashionable Stromsgodset, Deila is an unexpected arrival. 
Former Parkhead striker Andy Walker describes the choice as 
‘underwhelming’.

To
 those who expected Henrik Larsson or Roy Keane to be standing on Celtic
 Way yesterday, scarf raised, that is a view with some traction.

Yet Deila cut an impressive and sure-footed figure, combining quiet confidence and conviction with humility.

On social media and beyond Celtic supporters are broadly supportive. Many were uninspired by Larsson and Keane as options and praise their club for ‘thinking outside the box’.

To others the new man is simply the ‘cheap option’.  

It’s undeniable that Deila ia a risky 
choice. He has never managed in the Champions League but will be 
expected to negotiate three rounds of qualifying within six weeks. 
Failure will place him under immediate and sustained pressure.

How
 a Scandinavian coach with no experience of British football will cope 
with the demands and pressure of Celtic is the million dollar question. 
At Stromsgodset the average crowd was 6000. At Celtic they will be ten 
times that on European nights. This is a club where managers with 
greater experience than Ronny Deila have been chewed up and spat out 
like old tobacco. 

‘I have 
been in football for many, many years,’ responded the new man. ‘I have 
been a manager now for seven years in Stromsgodset.

‘The difference here is the atmosphere and I can’t say how I’m going to react to that - but I know I am a quick learner and that’s the most important thing. 

‘You have to learn from experiences, and develop, and that’s what I want. I have to be humble.

‘You can ask me questions about Europe - can I deal with it? - we’ll see. But I’m a quick learner. 

‘I
 just have to look around me and use my energy on the most important 
thing and that’s the product, what’s happening on the pitch. All around,
 if the product is good then good things will come from that.’  

Unarguably,
 he delivered a strong product at his last club. Appointed head coach of
 Stromsgodset at 32, Deila took a club described as the Kilmarnock of 
Norwegian football from 11th place in the league to their first title in
 43 years.  

But
 in an insular landscape like Scotland people are already racking their 
brains for examples of Norwegian managers succeeding in British 
football.

Stale Solbakken failed at Wolves. Egil Olsen failed at Wimbledon. Henning Berg failed at Blackburn and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was unable to keep Cardiff City afloat in the English Premiership. 

‘I don’t go around thinking that I am bringing all of Norway with me,’ shrugged the latest man to have a go. ‘But I know the Norwegian people want me to succeed. 

‘I have my own way of thinking about the
 job. I don’t know what other Norwegians have done. We are different 
people. In Scotland not everyone is the same. I will do everything I can
 to succeed and I hope that will help Norway as well.’  

The
 expectation is that a Swede would replace Neil Lennon. Henrik Larsson 
met major shareholder Dermot Desmond. Roy Keane did as well.  

When the box office options ruled themselves out Deila emerged as a very different candidate.  

The
 Norwegian is also a prototype of how people imagine Peter Lawwell’s 
perfect Celtic manager. His salary will be manageable. He worked with a 
budget at Stromsgodset, he developed young players and he understood the
 need to sell.

Lawwell says he is a ‘good fit’ for the Celtic model and was always in the club’s thinking. Last winter Deila turned down Malmo because the job didn’t feel right. Celtic were different. 

‘I had the feeling I was wanted, it felt different,’ he said. ‘It is the philosophy and the values and you feel you can be a part of it. I didn’t say Malmo was bad at that - but I felt ready here and that this is the right step.’

Deila also had the all-important Desmond seal of approval after a meeting early this week.

‘It was a very good meeting,’ said the Norwegian. ‘He sees things. 

‘I could have left the room after three minutes because he had already read me. 

‘He has unbelievable knowledge and how he’s putting things together, so I have big respect for him.’ 

At
 first Celtic saw Deila as a possible assistant manager. Neil Lennon 
confirmed as much in an interview yesterday, saying he was asked to 
consider the Norwegian as a possible replacement when Johan Mjallby 
left.

Some will ask how a coach regarded as a potential No2 can become the main man so swiftly, but it hardly matters now. Mjallby’s replacement will now be a Scot, with John Collins the leading candidate.

Intriguingly, rumour has it that 
Collins and Celtic skipper Scott Brown have an uneasy relationship from 
their days at Hibernian. 

But
 Deila sees the need for a Scottish assistant who knows his way around 
Inverness without a sat nav and will meet other candidates as well. He 
has no intention of importing his Stromsgodset players and staff en 
masse. 

‘It is really 
important to have people who are from Scotland and from Celtic,’ he 
admitted. ‘You never know what will happen, maybe foreign people or 
players will come.

But there are a lot of good people working in Scotland.’  

He
 speaks in flawless English, but also speaks German fluently. A father 
of 14-year-old twin daughters he is a keen student of the game, touring 
continental clubs – Dortmund, Liverpool, Rennes, Manchester City – to 
enhance his coaching experience. 

Backing: Predecessor Neil Lennon has backed Deila's credentials after he came highly recommended

The Manchester trip proved pivotal. Celtic sources say the English club recommended the Norwegian and while in England he travelled north to take in his one and only Celtic match. 

‘I was here for the Barcelona game. I went to see the Celtic-Barcelona under-19s and then I went to the main match, too,’ he revealed. 

‘The day before I was at Manchester City-Bayern Munich, under-19s and the first teams. That was an unbelievable experience, to be here. The atmosphere and everything. 

‘I almost never take pictures - but I filmed that. So many times I have looked at that film, when ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’ was sung before the match. I showed my girls. 

‘At that point I didn’t know that this was going to happen. I’ve been a Liverpool fan – but  I think the atmosphere is much better here. 

‘When I’m driving the car home at night, I get goosebumps when I think about it. 

‘That is football. It’s fun to win, but the way to win is the most fun thing. 

‘I hope I can sit in my car driving to my apartment somewhere near here and feel that emotion many times.’
