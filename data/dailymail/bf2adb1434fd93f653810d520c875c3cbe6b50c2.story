Defence attorneys today played a videotaped interview of a nine-year-old girl whose father is facing a possible death sentence for a home invasion that killed three people.

Joshua Komisarjevsky's daughter giggles frequently in the 20 minute video as she talks to a child welfare expert about her dogs and other animals and her toys. At one point, she says she used to play with 'Nana's son Josh' and says he went to jail for something.

Komisarjevsky, 31, objected to his attorneys' plans to play the video as they try to persuade the jury to spare him the death penalty, saying
he didn't want his daughter to feel compelled to help 'one of the most 
hated people in America.'

Guilty: The jury convicted Joshua Komisarjevsky last month on all 17 counts in the home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault

Komisarjevsky and his co-defendant, 
Steven Hayes, were convicted of murder in the 2007 killing of Jennifer 
Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, 17-year-old Hayley and 11-year-old 
Michaela, at their Connecticut home.

Caroline Long Burry, a child welfare 
expert interviewed the girl last weekend, said Komisarjevsky's daughter 
calls him 'Daddy Josh' when she's with his family, but refers to him as 
the son of her grandfather when with her maternal relatives.

As Courant.com reports, she was told 
by her maternal aunt, her relative guardian, that she was going to the 
legal guardian's office to talk, and was not aware she was being filmed.

As the video played, some jurors 
smiled as the girl laughed, doing puzzles and colouring pictures with Ms
Burry during the interview. Komisarjevsky looked intently at the 
screen.

In a two-minute segment, the girl, 
after seeing a photo of her father, said: 'Josh... went to jail for 
something he did at work.'

When asked if she recalled ever living with Josh, the girl replied: 'I don't remember anything.'

Ms Burry later testified, describing 
the girl as 'bright, engaging and sparkly' and expressed concerns that 
if Komisarjevsky's execution could be 'very damaging' to the girl. 'She 
would have to live on a daily basis with being labelled and quite 
possibly stigmatised with the fact her father is on death row and there 
is an execution coming up,' Ms Burry explained.

She also said the girl is known to 
withdraw and has a lot of anxiety, and that prison records showed that 
Komisarjevsky had 55 visits with his daughter while he was in prison.

Prosecutor Michael Dearington reminded
jurors under cross-examination that Komisarjevsky was convicted of 
sexually assaulting and killing a girl less than two years older than 
his daughter.

'In this particular situation, I
have carefully weighed the potential risks and have found that those 
risks and negative consequences to my daughter far outweigh the benefits
of helping save my life.'

Dearington also noted that those sentenced to death spend 
many years on death row and asked Burry about the last execution, which 
was in 2005 and was the only one since 1960 in Connecticut.

Komisarjevsky, speaking for the first 
time in his trial other than a taped confession, told the trial judge 
earlier today that his daughter was coached, an allegation denied by an 
attorney for the girl's guardian.

Reading from a three-page statement 
his attorneys had not reviewed, he said: 'In this particular situation, I
have carefully weighed the potential risks and have found that those 
risks and negative consequences to my daughter far outweigh the benefits
of helping save my life.'

Standing behind the defence table as 
he addressed the judge, wearing a dark suit and tie, he continued: 'I've
carefully come to the overwhelming opinion that I am not at all 
comfortable putting my daughter in a position wherein she may feel that 
she has to explain or justify herself to anyone who perceives her 
statements to somehow help one of the most hated people in America.'

'She's nine-years-old. Had this 
interview been her decision to make and she was old enough to understand
that decision that would be one thing. However, that is not the case in
this situation. The decision has been made for her,' he said.

Komisarjevsky noted his life is on the
line. He said the negative consequences to his daughter outweigh the 
benefits of helping to save his life.

'I will not beg for my life,' he said.
'I will humbly request in earnest that your honour please uphold the 
thoughtfully weighed decision of defendant over the wish of the defence 
team.'

Turning point: Joshua Komisarjevsky sorted his life out for a while and completed Army Reserve training

New Haven Superior Court Judge Jon 
Blue overruled his objection, agreeing with the attorneys that they have
the final say. Komisarjevsky's lawyers played the videotape of the girl
in hopes of persuading jurors to spare him the death penalty later in 
the morning.

Only jurors were permitted to see and 
hear the video, while credentialed journalists and others in the 
courtroom gallery could only hear it and watch reactions from the jury.

Accomplice: Steven Hayes is already on death row for the killings

The attorney for the girl's guardian said the interview with the girl was done carefully in a non-confrontational way.

Komisarjevsky said his daughter has been told by her guardian not to talk about him.

'It should also be considered how her 
memorialised words will affect her emotionally and psychologically in 
the future if she believes she's party to assisting the effort to put me
to death,' he said.

As Courant reports, Ms Burry said she 
believed the girl's friends and acquaintances do not know she is 
Komisarjevsky's daughter. Her name has been changed. After her paternal 
grandparents Ben and Jude Komisarjevsky lost custody of the girl, she 
went to live with her maternal grandmother. When the grandmother died, a
maternal aunt became her guardian. The girl's mother has struggled with
drug addiction and was admitted in the past to a psychiatric hospital.

Komisarjevsky, was 
convicted last month on all 17 counts in the 2007 Cheshire, Connecticut home invasion - including capital felony, murder and sexual assault.

Komisarjevsky and Hayes were convicted
of killing Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her two daughters, 11-year-old 
Michaela and 17-year-old Hayley, in their Cheshire home. Authorities say
Komisarjevsky sexually assaulted Michaela, who would have turned 16 
today.

Hayes, meanwhile, sexually assaulted and strangled Hawke-Petit.

The house was then set on fire, and 
the two girls – who were tied to their beds – died of smoke inhalation. 
Hawke-Petit's husband, Dr William Petit, was severely beaten but 
survived.

Komisarjevsky and Hayes were caught 
when they crashed the Petits' car into police cruisers near the home 
while fleeing. Komisarjevsky's accomplice, Steven Hayes is on death row 
following his 2010 conviction.

In Komisarjevsky's case, jurors will 
have to weigh whether aggravating factors in the case, including the 
sexual assaults, outweigh mitigating factors, such as Komisarjevsky's 
troubled childhood.

The same Superior Court jury that 
convicted Komisarjevsky will decide whether he should be sentenced to 
death by lethal injection or to life in prison without the possibility 
of parole.

The defence is expected to rest next Tuesday. The sentencing phase began October 25.
