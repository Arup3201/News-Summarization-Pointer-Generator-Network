Tiffany Doty says her son might still be alive today if it were not for a woman who intentionally strung her family along with a false promise to help out.

On Wednesday Thomas Doty lost his life to a rare form of bone cancer called Osteosarcoma at the age of 20. He had been diagnosed with the disease in 2009 at the age of 16.

Prior to his death, a promise of $250,000 for his treatment turned out to be hoax from a scam artist and possibly caused the young cancer patient his life, Ms Doty told KOMO 4 News in Seattle.

Hurt mother: Tiffany Doty says her son might still be alive today if it were not for a woman who made a false promise to send the family a check for $250,000 to pay for his surgery

Lost time: 'I honestly 100 percent believe my son would be here if that time had not been wasted,' Tiffany Doty said

Just a week ago, Thomas Doty was showing promise and improving daily after a stay in a California Hospital specializing in difficult cancer cases, his mother said.

‘I honestly believed...and the doctors we were working with believed wholeheartedly that they could save Thomas' life,’ she said.

The woman’s misleading promise came after Johnathan Hillstrand of ‘the Deadliest Catch’ TV show, a friend of the family, reached out to his fans and asked them to help Thomas Doty.

Mrs Doty says her family had recently come into financial hardship, including foreclosure on their home, and were unable to cover the $50,000 doctors needed to perform a special surgery.

The unknown culprit, who claimed to be an Indiana nurse, emailed Mrs Doty saying she was going to send a check for $250,000 to pay for the treatment.

But after eight weeks of back and forth phone calls and reassurances, the money never arrived and the false guarantee pushed back Thomas Doty’s surgery, Mrs Doty says.

Lost time: 'I honestly 100 percent believe my son would be here if that time had not been wasted,' she said.

Mrs Doty said she believes the woman lied in an attempt to please Mr Hillstrand.

'Shoot for the stars': Thomas Doty's 'favorite quote was, "Shoot for the stars...see you in heaven," his mother said.

'She would get on the phone with me and say, “I'm so sorry for what you’re going through and did you tell Thomas the wire is on the way?”’ Mrs Doty said.

The family's attorney told KOMO 4 News that if he can track down the woman, he will take her to court for intentional infliction of emotional distress and potential criminal charges.

Mrs Doty says the woman is even now harassing her family after the death of their son.

They plan to contact police after laying their son to rest.

Thomas Doty's funeral was held on Saturday at Christian Faith Center in Washington state.
