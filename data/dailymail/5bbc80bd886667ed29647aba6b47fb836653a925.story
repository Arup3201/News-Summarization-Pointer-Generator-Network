A 19-year-old University of Maryland lacrosse player was arrested at an outdoor concert in Virginia Sunday night after allegedly groping a 49-year-old mother passed out on the lawn.

Prince William County Police say the woman fell asleep on the Jiffy Lube Live lawn during a Zac Brown Band concert, when she woke up to find teen Benjamin Chisolm  touching her inappropriately.

Chisolm walked away after the attack but was later arrested for public intoxication and now faces additional charges of aggravated sexual assault.

The victim, identified as 'Donna', has come forward to dispute details of the police report and reveal the exact nature of the sexual assault.

The mother of five says she was attending the concert with a large group of people that included her daughter and daughter's boyfriend and that it was the first time she was out with her new pacemaker since suffering a heart attack in October.

She says she did not fall asleep at the concert, but had gotten overheated and needed to sit down.

Her daughter was cooling her off with a cold water bottle when Chisolm sat down next to her.

'This guy comes running up and slides up right behind me like he was spooning me, and he was grinding his bottom half against my bottom half, and he took his arm and put it around me and grabbed my breast,' Donna told Fox 5.

She says her daughter's boyfriend then got up and threw Chisolm off her, but that Chisolm and his friends continued to berate their group after the assault.

Donna says the whole situation has left her shaken.

'No, I wasn't raped. No, my clothes weren't taken off. But I feel weird because somebody else touched me that I did not know. That I didn't give permission.'

Chisolm, of Davidsonville, Maryland, is a rising freshman at the College Park school.

Serious allegations: The University of Maryland issued a statement, saying they are taking the assault seriously. Above, an aerial view of the concert venue

The university has since issued a statement, saying they have heard about the incident and taking it seriously.

'We are aware of the reported incident regarding one of our student-athletes. The university takes these matters very seriously and will cooperate with authorities during their investigation,' the university said in a statement.

During his first year at the school, Chisholm scored two goals during different games.

He graduated in 2013 from South River High School in Edgewater, Maryland where he was named an All-American athlete twice. He was also rated by ESPN to be a top 50 high school junior lacrosse player.

Chisolm is being held without bond pending a hearing on July 17.
