Wounded war veterans are to receive £7,000-a-year for life to ensure welfare reforms do not affect the military.

In future maimed forces veterans will not face extra assessments of their disability by civil servants to confirm the results of existing military tests.

Disability minister Esther McVey told MailOnline said the new funds would recognise the ‘unique support needs of veterans’.

Injured war veterans will not face having their disability repeatedly reassessed under welfare reforms which will ensure they receive almost £7,000-a-year for life

She revealed the total amount available to injured soldiers, sailors and pilots will be £6,988.80 per year, more than £200 extra than thought when the policy was announced last year.

Disability Living Allowance is being scrapped from April but ministers have agreed that the payments will be continued for former defence personnel whose injuries sustained in the line of duty affect their quality of life.

The Personal Independence Payment will be paid to all working-age people with serious problems, but claimants will be re-examined and could have payments cut.

Disability minister Esther McVey said the government wanted to recognise the unique support needs of veterans

However, the Armed Forces Independence Payment will be awarded by the Ministry of Defence as part of the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme and will not affect any other benefits to which claimants are entitled.

Injured ex-troops will automatically receive on-going payments to help with the additional costs associated with their injuries.

Miss McVey said: ‘A considerable sacrifice is made by a number of courageous members of the Armed Forces who have been injured as a result of their service to the Nation.

‘That is why we are simplifying and streamlining the welfare support for the most severely injured veterans when they return to the UK.

‘It will help to recognise the unique support needs of veterans.’

The government’s major reforms of the welfare system will see the introduction of a single payment for most benefits – known as the Universal Credit – rolled out from this year.

But ministers insist job-seeking forces veterans will not lose out when the new system comes into force.,

Any ongoing income that veterans get from Ministry of Defence compensation schemes and the new Armed Forces Independence Payment will not be taken into account when calculating how much support they should receive through Universal Credit.

In July David Cameron intervened in a benefits row after it emerged wounded troops would not automatically receive help under new welfare rules.

Details of the Armed Forces Independence Payment emerged last year during a visit to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan by Prime Minister David Cameron

During a visit to Camp Bastion in Afghanistan, the Prime Minister promised a ‘special deal’ in a sign that Britain ‘respects and reveres’ its Armed Forces.

At the time it was thought inured ex-military personnel would receive around £6,700-a-year towards care and the cost of living.

But Miss McVey said the figure would be higher, starting at £6,988.80 from its introduction in April.

The reforms scrap the need for anyone with granted compensation for war injuries to undergo a separate assessment by civil servants before they could be granted benefits.
