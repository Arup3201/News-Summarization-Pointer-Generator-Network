Leicester manager Nigel Pearson has revealed he contacted Crystal Palace midfielder James McArthur after his controversial touchline antics.

The Foxes boss was seen throttling McArthur, while the midfielder laid on the floor, during Palace's win on Saturday.

Pearson, who escaped FA sanctions over the incident, insisted his actions were in jest and were not meant to be serious.

And Pearson phoned McArthur on Monday night to explain his actions.

'I don't wish I had handled it differently, it was jovial - things happen quickly in games,' said Pearson.

'I spoke to him on Monday night, he actually text me and I was composing a text back but just decided to call him.

'I apologise to Alan [Pardew] for calling one of his players but it was just a friendly chat and I think McArthur comes out very well from the situation.

Meanwhile, Pearson held clear-the-air talks with the club's owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha on Tuesday.

Speculation over the manager's future at the King Power Stadium has been rife in recent weeks, while there were even claims he had been sacked on Sunday.

However, Pearson claims he has been assured of his future following Tuesday's discussions.

'They [the owners] don't want to get rid of me,' said Pearson.

'Have I been given more assurances? Yes, I had lunch with the owners today, so there we are.'
