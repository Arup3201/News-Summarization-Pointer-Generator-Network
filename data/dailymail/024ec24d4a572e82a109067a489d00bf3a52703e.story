It was the day when all that was good reigned over all that was bad in the life and death of murdered Australian baseballer Chris Lane.

Hundreds of friends - those who had played with him as a kid to old folks on walking sticks who had watched his sporting progress - gathered today on 'Laney's' field of dreams in Melbourne where his sporting life as a catcher had taken off.

His family and friends had shed tears all week since the day they learned that Chris had been shot randomly in the back as he jogged through the streets of Duncan, Oklahoma, on August 16.

Remembered: A tribute game was held in Melbourne Sunday afternoon to celebrate the life of slain Australian baseball player Chris Lane

But today there was more joy than sorrow at a life remembered as red and black balloons, in the colors of the Essendon club that Chris had formerly played for, were released, bearing his player's number 40.

Boredom: Lane was gunned down while out on a jog in Oklahoma where he was attending school on a baseball scholarship. The teens who shot him did it because they were 'bored'

His girlfriend, 22-year-old Sarah Harper, flew from the US to be there for the tribute game. Chris's parents, Peter and Donna were there. His sisters, Erin, Andrea and Jennifer were there, along with Andrea's baby daughter.

So, too, were all his former clubmates but equally touching was the presence of strangers who didn't even know Chris but who felt the need to drop by and share the tribute being paid by hundreds of others who turned out to watch the Essendon Club play Melbourne University.

His parents hugged those who waited patiently in a bitter winter's wind to pass on memories of their son before some of those who gathered allowed a few tears to fall as senior and junior players walked onto the field and stood with caps against their chests while the American and Australian national anthems were played.

Chris's parents, forcing back tears 
which tried to well up, spoke of their strong and talented son, but 
agreed that while they would never stop looking back at his life, it was
also time to look to the future.

Referring
to the trauma that the Lane family and friends would have to face as 
details of his murder are played out through the US courts, Mr Lane 
said: 'Distance isn't going to change the size of the task ahead, but we
still have three beautiful daughters and we have grandchildren.

'They
need to pick themselves up each day and get on with their lives. 
Whatever task you need to do, you get up each day and you have to move 
forward.'

He
and his wife, he said, as they stood on a windy hill overlooking the 
field where Chris had played so often, had been moved by the 'tremendous
tributes', particularly as their son had been in the US for four years.

'So many people have been prepared to roll out and support him. He was much loved, but I have never doubted that for a minute.

'It's
nice to have so many people come here, so many family faces, kids Chris
played under-11s with and who maybe gave up the game when they were 
under 12. They knew what a guy he was when he was in 11 and 12.'

But
it was the girl he had met and loved - Sarah - who Peter and Donna 
acknowledged was 'quite a girl'. He described her as 'an outstanding 
kid, with such a strong personality and temperament' and it was 
important for her to be in Australia at this time 'because we will hang 
together.'

Donna described 
her as a 'beautiful, gorgeous, strong young woman' who carried Chris on 
from the upbringing he had received in Australia when he had been 
surrounded by strong women in his family.

Sarah
had decided to allow his club friends and his parents do all the 
talking today but she said through officials that she was deeply moved 
by the tribute match, in which all the players wore black arm bands.

Torn apart by tragedy: Lane's mother said she was glad that girlfriend Sarah Harper made it out for the game and described her as a 'beautiful, gorgeous and strong young woman'

President Barack Obama has sent his thoughts and prayers to Chris' family, saying through a spokesman that 'there is an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life short,' but Mr Lane said he did not want to get drawn into a political discussion about America's gun laws.

'I have said at the start that we are not buying into gun control, punishment, race issues or any such thing.

'Our kid died in horrible circumstances and that is not going to be solved by me standing here making statements about the American political system or anything like that. I'm not buying into any of these other issues.'

Like many traumatic moments, players said they would always remember what they were doing when they heard the news that Chris had been gunned down, reportedly by three bored teenagers who had allegedly set out to murder someone - and he was the anonymous target they had picked.

Word had spread rapidly from a single phone call from the US - and within hours most of Chris's friends had heard. Dean Mackintyre, the team pitcher, heard just before a game last weekend. They continued playing, but their hearts weren't in it, he said.

'He was such a good mate and I went into deep shock when I heard about it,' said Dean. 'He was just one of the boys, always enjoying himself. I remember when we lost a grand final on one occasion we all ended up with terrible hangovers on a hotel room floor - good job we didn't win!'

Josh Davies, the team's shortstop, was on holiday with a group of friends in the Snowy Mountains of New South Wales when they received the news. 'It put a total dampener on the holiday, of course. It was straight out of the blue.'

Gary O'Brien, 58, leaning on a walking stick, told how he had watched Chris progress through the club and said he knew that he would go far. 'It's so tough to think that his life has been cut down like this,' he said. 'I'm still trying to come to terms with it'

Steve Morris, the club's vice-president recalled watching Chris play as a junior at the age of seven.

'He was playing in a tournament and he was so tired afterwards - having put in so much effort - that his dad had to carry him to the car.

'He went on to play Australian rules football for three clubs, winning the "Best and Fairest" award on one occasion. That's the kind of guy he was.'

As sausages sizzled and people lined up for coffee from a mobile kiosk - typifying a weekend Aussie family gathering for a community-conscious club - the last word came from Chris's father, referring to a newspaper story about his son's murder.

'A front page calling him a baseball star - he would have loved that because he never saw himself that way. There have been quite a few things he would have taken the micky out of. Me crying for a start.

'He would have told me to toughen up!'

Staying strong: Chris' father Peter Lane said at the Sunday tribute game that his son would have wanted him to 'toughen up'
