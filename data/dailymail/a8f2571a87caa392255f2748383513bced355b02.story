A man was arrested on a drug charge after police were helped by his own dog.

Police in Prattville, Alabama, were trying to serve a search warrant on Edwin Henderson when he fled into a ravine behind his house.

One of the officers pointed at Henderson and told the dog 'go get him,' police spokeswoman Paula Barlo said.

Bo the dog then took off after his master.

When the pet stopped and wagged his tail in tall grass, police found and arrested Henderson.  

Henderson is charged with failure to obey police, manufacturing a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. 

It's unclear if he has an attorney, and there's no word on who's taking care of Bo.
