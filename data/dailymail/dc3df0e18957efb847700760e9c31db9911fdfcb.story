The twin car to the limousine in which President John F Kennedy was assassinated, one of only two ever made, is expected to fetch over $150,000 when it goes up for auction next week.

The stretched Lincoln Continental convertible is an exact version of the one that 
was used to chauffeur the US President from 1961 until his infamous 
death on November 22, 1963 in Dallas.

The Kennedy car is now displayed at 
the Henry Ford Motor Museum in the US but has a permanent hard roof and 
bullet proof glass that were installed after the shooting.

Historical opportunity: This Lincoln limousine, the twin car of the one 
that John F Kennedy was assassinated in is coming up for auction

That fateful day: President Kennedy with wife Jacqueline, Texas Governor John Connally and his wife Nellie Connally ride together in the Limousine in Dallas on the day of the assassination, November 23, 1963

It's twin version, which goes under the hammer in Belgium on October 11, wasn't modified and so is unique as identical to the JFK limousine at the time of his assassination.

It was commissioned by the White House in 1963 - the same year as JFK's death so he never rode in it. It is in immaculate condition with only 560 kilometres on the clock.

The left hand drive car, that is expected to go for between $120,000 and $220,000,
has two rows of rear seats, extra wide doors to enable VIP passengers 
to get in and out with ease and internal radio telephones.

Distinctive: The twin car of the the JFK limousine with its running boards and handles at the back for secret service men

Interior: The Lincoln limousine stretches 21ft and weighs 3.5 ton monster. It is powered by a massive 440 inch V8 engine

It
also has four distinctive retractable running boards meant for Secret 
Service agents to stand on, two permanent footplates at the back and two
grab handles for the bodyguards.

And it comes with the US Presidential
Seal on both sides and on the floor mats and the Stars and Stripes and 
Presidential flags on the front.

Its
sale will now provide people with the macabre opportunity to travel in 
the same fashion the former president of the US was used to.

The dark blue car has belonged to the owner of a French motor museum for that last 30 years.

It is being sold by London-based auctioneers Bonhams.

Rarity: One of only two ever made, the stretched Lincoln Continental convertible was commissioned by the White House in 1963 - the same year as JFK's death - as an exact replica of the one already used by him

Philip
Kantor, Bonhams' head of European motoring, said: 'This car is an exact
replica of the one JFK was assasinated in and was built by the same 
coachbuilders.

'It is as 
close to the the JFK one as you are going to get. It is a one off, we 
don't know of another one that is identical to the Dallas limousine as 
this one.

'They weren't mass produced because there was no consumer demand for them.

'It was a parade car and was made to run at speeds of between 10mph to 40mph.

'Its
sale is a wonderful opportunity to acquire a faithful replica of this 
historic vehicle on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the JFK 
assasination.

'This car really should be for a private collection, you wouldn't drive this down to the pub.'

After
JFK's election in 1961, the White House commissioned a new Presidential
limousine from Ford and specified that the car had to be a convertible.

They
took a Ford Lincoln Continental to specialist coachbuilders Hess & 
Eisenhardt in Cincinnati, Ohio who stretched the 17ft car by nearly 4ft.

It came with seven different types of hard top, including a transparent roof, but hadno armour plating.

The 21ft, 3.5 ton vehicle was powered by a massive 440 inch V8 engine.

The
JFK limousine - codenamed SS 100X - was driven through Dallas by Secret
Service agent William Greer on the day of the assassination.

JFK
and his wife Jackie were sat in the back seat while Texas governor John
Conally was positioned in the jump seat directly in front of the 
president at the time of the shooting.

After
the world-changing event, the car was sent back to the coachbuilders 
and fitted with titanium armor, bulletproof glass and given a permanent 
hard top.

It was used by Presidents Johnson, Nixon, Ford and Carter before it went to the Ford Museum in Michigan in 1977.

The twin car is being sold at auction in Belgium on October 11.

Last year the hearse which carried John F Kennedy’s casket  fetched $160,000 when it was auctioned off.
