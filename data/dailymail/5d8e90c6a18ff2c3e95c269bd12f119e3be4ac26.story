Oscar winner Halle Berry's ex made 'completely and totally unacceptable' racial slurs against the actress - and dyed their six-year-old daughter's hair blonde, it was revealed in court today.

The star took her former love, Gabriel Aubry, to court, accusing him of straightening their little girl Nahla's naturally curly hair and lightening it over the past year in a bid to deny her African-American heritage.

As a result, Halle said in court documents, Aubry had caused Nahla 'potential psychological and physical damage' - and could cause her to wonder 'why her natural appearance is not good enough'.

A judge ruled today that neither Halle nor Aubry can now change Nahla's hair, while court records obtained by MailOnline show that Aubry has made shocking racist remarks against the star.

In a note included on Halle's testimony to the court about her ex's 'reprehensible' actions, she referred to the findings of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mark Juhas, who presided over their recent custody case. 

He said: 'The racial epithet made by Petitioner was and is completely and totally unacceptable.

'Nahla is a child of both of these parents, making this sort of comment about Respondent affect the very core and being of Nahla.

'And when Petitioner attacked Respondent for what she is and who she is, he was attacking Nahla because Nahla is part Respondent. And Nahla is part Petitioner. So when Petitioner did those things, that does serious damage to Nahla because he is attacking her core being, who she is.'

Today, a source close to Halle told MailOnline Gabriel had used racially abusive language to Halle - claiming he called her the N word - but said: 'Halle is a great mom, she wants to keep Nahla on an even keel.'

Describing Halle's fears over Nahla's hair, the source said: 'Halle kept asking and asking Gabriel about Nahla's hair and he kept denying it.

'What does this say to a six year old who’s half black? Her father is denying her identity.

'Halle then filed the court papers and Nahla's curls came back.'

In her testimony, Halle said: 'I strongly feel that Gabriel's same underlying attitude is at the root in the changes which only he could have been causing to our daughter's hair.'

She told how she had secured scientific evidence to prove she is not 'delusional', as Gabriel had called her, 'about the extensive damage and the changes to the texture and color of Nahla's hair that were observed by me. I was not willing to allow this to be a 'he said-she said' dispute.'

The actress told how she had collected Nahla's hair with a new brush and sent the strands from June 28, 2014, to a laboratory.

Heritage: Halle Berry fears her daughter Nahla, seen in LA on Mother's Day in May, will feel her appearance is not good enough if her dad Gabriel Aubry is allowed to continue dyeing and straightening her hair 

She said she first noticed a difference in her daughter's hair when Nahla returned from visiting her father in August 2013, saying : 'Gabriel continues to maintain that he has done and is doing nothing to cause the extensive straightening, color changes, stripping and damaging of our daughter's hair.

'I have personally observed the changes in Nahla's hair texture and color over the last year. I have never personally experienced hair damage nor have I ever known a single person whose hair has suffered such excessive changes from spending time in a salt water pool (or even chlorinated water) and sunlight.' 

Halle put forward 'before and after' photos of Nahla to the court and said: 'I have since reviewed the laboratory report concerning this very hair sample that I obtained, which confirms to me that Gabriel has not been truthful about what he has done and had been doing to our daughter's hair.'

The star's mother Judith is white and originally from Liverpool in the UK, while her father, Jerome Jesse Berry is of African-American heritage. 

And she noted: 'I continue to worry about the potential psychological and physical damage to Nahla that can be caused by the use of chemical hair treatments and the psychological message that it conveys to Nahla, and to implore the court to put a stop to Gabriel's attempts to alter our daughter's appearance and most probably cause her to wonder why her natural appearance is not good enough.'

This is the latest court battle for Halle and Aubry, who split in 2010 after four years together, leading to a lengthy custody dispute over Nahla. In 2012, Halle was banned from moving with Nahla to France, where she said they would have more privacy.

Little Goldilocks: While Halle Berry was pregnant with son Maceo-Robert, daughter Nahla sported blonde locks, a result, Halle says, of Gabriel Aubry dying their daughter's hair.  Mother and daughter are seen in August 2013 - when Halle says she first noticed Nahla's hair was different 

The pair are currently in court as Halle - who became the first the first African American woman to win an Oscar for best actress for Monster's Ball in 2002 - is seeking to cut her monthly child support payments to Aubry. 

She is making a bid to reduce her monthly payments from about $16,000 to $3,800. But Aubry claims he needs the money because he was unable to book modeling jobs after he came to blows with Halle's husband, French actor Olivier Martinez on Thanksgiving 2012. 

For her part, Halle alleges that Aubry uses the child support for his own fitness, clothing, electronics, car and health insurance, TMZ has reported.

Halle and Martinez, 48,married in July 2013 and welcomed son Maceo-Robert that October.

Halle was not at court in Los Angeles on Monday morning, but her lawyer Steve Kolodny was present, along with Gabriel. 

The source said: 'When Halle has a problem, she just goes to court to settle it. Nahla is a great little girl,  and they are incredibly close.

'Nahla is always foremost in her mind.' 

In the court papers, Halle said she was keen to work together with Gabriel, adding: 'I want both Gabriel and I to make decisions together that affect our daughter, her growth, her development and her general welfare...

'I continue to hope that Gabriel and I can find a way to work together to be successful co-parents. It was with regret that I concluded that I had to seek the court's intervention on these issues, but until Gabriel recognizes the meaning of joint legal custody and how it is implemented, it appears that hte court will be my only resort to safeguard Nahla's best interests.'
