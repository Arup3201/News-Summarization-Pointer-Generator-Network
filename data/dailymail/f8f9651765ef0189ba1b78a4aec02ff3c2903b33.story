Ryanair will increase its baggage charges until no-one can afford to take luggage for the hold, the budget airline’s flamboyant boss said today.

Michael O'Leary who admits to himself paying 'a fortune' in excess baggage, added it was likely that ‘at some point’ airlines would start charging even for hand luggage.

His plan to price bags of his airline
was revealed a news conference in London. Mr O'Leary said that Ryanair 
had already increased its charge for hold luggage by £20 for the summer 
period to catch out holidaymakers.

Rising prices: Ryanair's Michael O'Leary has revealed the airline will increase its baggage charges until no-one can afford to take luggage for the hold - and it's already increase its hold luggage charge by £20 this summer

Asked
what was the logic behind charging people more for the summer period, 
he replied: 'That's when they are likely to bring more bags.'

Mr O'Leary went on: ‘We will keep increasing charges until we get rid of (hold) bags.'

He
said Ryanair had reduced the number of its passengers who checked in 
hold baggage from 80 per cent  to 19 per cent and that this was saving 
the airline ‘a fortune in money’.

But he accepted that some passengers would always want to bring big bags that needed to go in the hold.

He
said: ‘We will never get rid of (hold) bags but I would be disappointed
if we don't get our figure for (hold) bags down from around 20 per cent
to 10 per cent.’

Asked
if Ryanair would consider charging for hand luggage, Mr O'Leary said: 
‘At some point in the future I think it's likely that airlines will do 
it but I can't get my head round how you would do it. I think it's 
unlikely that we will do it.’

Carry-on only: Passengers wait to check-in at the Ryanair desk in Stansted. Passengers will still be able to bring hold luggage but it will become increasingly expensive as Ryanair tries to reduce the number of hold bags

Mr O'Leary's airline makes a fortune charging for extras’ and has even threatened charging passengers to use the toilet and to introduce ‘standing room’ style upright seats to boost passenger numbers.

This week the airline said it had ordered pilots to fly slower – adding two minutes to journeys – to save about £70million a year in fuel costs.

Asked if he was considering reducing the amount of air conditioning on his flights, Mr O'Leary said: ‘No. Even I would not do that.'

Last year he admitted to Management Today magazine:’ Of course I fly Ryanair, but it costs me a fortune in excess baggage.’

Ryanair also plans to offer advertising space on its planes  Asked if he would take an advert from low-fare rival airline easyJet Mr O'Leary replied: 'I would take an advert from anyone, even the UK Competition Commission (CC).

Ryanair has been battling the Competition Commission and other regulatory authorities since 2006 in his efforts to take over Irish carrier Aer Lingus.

Budget: A Ryanair jet taking off from Stansted Airport. Mr O'Leary this week ordered pilots to fly slower, adding two minutes to journeys, to save £70million-a-year in fuel costs

He said the Commission’s inquiry into the proposed takeover was ‘misguided’ and 'a political farce which has no case, no evidence and no credibility either’.

Ryanair said that from the end of October it was adding one extra daily flight to its five main Ireland-UK routes - from Dublin to Stansted, to Manchester, to Birmingham, to Edinburgh and to Bristol.

This is in direct response to similar flight increases recently announced by Aer Lingus.

Cash generated from ‘extras’ -  known as ‘ancillary revenue’  or the industry term for any income that doesn’t come from selling seats -  was up by 25 per cent to £308million.

This was helped by a boost from extra charges for allocated seating and priority boarding, as well as higher credit card fees. The decision to allow passengers to reserve a seat for a higher price echoes rival easyJet, where the extra option has also proved a success.

It imposes a £70 fine on travellers who forget to print out their boarding passes online – adding hundreds of pounds to the cost of a family holiday for those who fall foul. And the cost of  changing the name on a ticket is £110.

Ryanair’s outspoken chief executive Mr O’Leary has in the past branded those who don’t like paying for having their boarding cards printed out as 'idiots' who  should ‘b***** off’.

But the opinionated airline chief has no sympathy for other passengers who fall foul of his tightly drawn rules.

He criticised Berkshire mother-of-two Mrs Suzy McLeod who received backing from nearly half a million Facebook users when she was forced to pay £236 to print boarding passes for her family so they could fly home to Britain from Alicante, Spain.

He said: ’So she gets on 'the Twitter' to complain. Emboldened by the rising tide of support, Mrs McLeod asks for compensation, to which we replied politely but firmly, thank you, Mrs McLeod, but it was your f***-up. We're not changing our policy.’

Three years ago competition watchdogs at the Office of Fair Trading accused Ryanair of ‘puerile, almost childish’ behaviour in the way it imposed unexpected charges.
