Residents of a quiet Mississippi town fear that a legendary creature called El Chupacabra has come to life to terrorize them just in time for Halloween.

Jennifer Whitfield spotted the hairless beast near her yard in the suburban town of Picayune last week. Black, canine-like and lumbering, she said the unwanted visitor was like nothing she’d ever seen.

‘If a zombie had a dog,’ Whitefield said, ‘it would look like that.’

El Chupacabra? Some residents of a small Mississippi have been scared to even go outside after a creature resembling a legendary blood-sucking beast started showing up in their backyards

Uncanny: Like the beast of legend, the animal in Picayune, Mississippi is hairless, lumbering, and has an elongated snout

Whitfield spotted the creature with her 11-year-old son Justin, who was quick thinking enough to capture video of their frightening encounter, reports WLOX.

The footage shows an animal not unlike a dog, but hairless and with a strange, elongated snout.

It looks just like El Chupacabra, a creature originally of Puerto Rican legend whose notoriety has spread to the mainland U.S. along with alleged sightings of the livestock killing, blood sucking monster.

Down the street from the Whitfields, the Denton family had seen it, too.

'If a zombie had a dog, it would look like that,' said resident Jennifer Whitfield, who caught the animal on video with her son Justin

Mangy? Mississippi wildlife authority David Burnette hasn't seen the creature but believes it's likely a coyote with a bad case of the mange

Opportunistic? Burnette says the animal is likely very ill and staying close to human habitats in order to have an easily obtainable source of food in the form of trash

Amanda Denton did the natural things and turned to Google for an answer.

‘I kept looking up “hairless coyote” and it kept saying “chupacabra,”’ Denton told WLOX.

Thereafter, she stopped taking chances and made sure to avoid a potential encounter with El Chupacabra.

‘We've been running back and forth to our cars because we didn't want the chupacabra to get us,’ she said.

Authorities were called, but at first their efforts were for naught.

‘I didn't know what it was, but then Animal Control couldn't find it, so maybe it was a chupacabra,’ said Denton’s husband Jonathan.

LEGEND AND SIGHTINGS OF EL CHUPACABRA

The word comes from two Spanish words - 'chupar', to suck, and 'cabra', goat.

The first reported sighting was In 1995, when eight sheep were found dead in Puerto Rico with identical puncture wounds to the chest and completely drained of blood.

Thus, the legend of the livestock killing, vampire-like chupacabra was born.

Since then, the legendary beast has been spotted across the Americas and even the world.

A Mexican incident where 35 sheep were found mysteriously dead was blamed on El Chupacabra in 2012.

Earlier this year, yet another Mississippi sighting came when a Leake County man actually shot and killed what he claimed was El Chupacabra.

Even a Belarusian town had a Chupacabra sighting this past July

'Goat sucker': The legend of El Chupacabra likely originates from a 1995 case in Puerto Rico where 8 sheep were found dead with puncture wounds. It has been described as hairless, or as having spines along its back, and as having blue or red eyes, among other attributes

SCIENCE ATTEMPTS TO EXPLAIN

Scientists often speculate that hairless creatures believed to be El Chupacabra are actually wildlife like coyotes, foxes, and stray dogs infested with parasites.

Most commonly pointed to is the parasite Sarcoptes scabiei, which causes mange.

Mange is a painful, potentially life threatening condition which can cause complete hair loss in mammals and can also cause their skin to shrivel, making for an even more ghoulish looking beast.

In humans, Sarcoptes scabiei causes scabies and a consequent itchy, painful rash as the parasites burrow around, leaving their feces under the skin.

Finally, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks was called. Residents told Master Sergeant David Burnette what they saw and finally got a possible answer.

‘The way they described it to me,’ said Burnette, ‘it’s a coyote that’s really bad off with the mange.’

Burnette didn’t see the creature, but says it shouldn’t be an issue in the neighborhood so long as residents keep their distance.

‘It's probably sick, weak, and not able to hunt on its own, so it's going to the nearest food source it can find,’ he said.

Common? The Picayune sighting was not the first, even inn Mississippi. A man in Leake County, Mississippi shot and killed this animal he insisted was El Chupacabra just last month

Pan-American: This alleged Chupacabra showed up in Kentucky in 2010

That source happens to the trash left out by Picayune’s townspeople. The department advised residents ‘to let nature take its course.’

Similar alleged El Chupacabra spottings have been reported everywhere from nearby Leake County—where a man actually shot and killed the hairless beast he spotted—to Mexico and all the way in Belarus, where farmers killed what some say was a Chupacabra that was attacking local cows.

In some instances, like in Leake County, a mange-infested animal was blamed. In Belarus, some say the creature was actually a fox poisoned by radiation.

In any case, believers become more and more convinced they've seen the legendary El Chupacabra remain adamant that the beast is real and as sightings continue popping up in Central America, the U.S. and across the world.
