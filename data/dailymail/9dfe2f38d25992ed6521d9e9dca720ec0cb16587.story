Despite playing for Real Madrid's greatest rivals, Cristiano Ronaldo has tipped Barcelona forward Neymar to become 'the best player in the world'.

The Portuguese currently holds that mantle after collecting a second Ballon d'Or this year, although his chances of retaining the award were hindered after stalled when he was taken off injured during Real Madrid's title slipping 1-1 draw with Valladoid on Wednesday.

Neymar has come in for criticism for his performances following a big money move to the Nou Camp in the summer. Injuries have played their part - with the Brazilian currently sidelined with a foot injury that is not expected to keep him from this summer's World Cup in his homeland.

While Ronaldo concedes that the 22-year-old has struggled during his first season in La Liga, he is certain that Neymar will eventually live up to his reputation.

Speaking to Brazilian channel sporTV, Ronaldo said:'I believe he has shown in recent times he is a player of the future, with huge potential to improve.

'His adaptation at Barcelona was not the best -- he had some problems at the start -- but I have no doubt that he has the potential to be one of the best players, or even the best player, in the world.'

High praise indeed from a player who rarely likes the limelight to be shifted from himself, especially if it's in the direction of his nemesis Lionel Messi.

All three players will be on show at the World Cup where, despite being drawn in the so-called Group of Death', Ronaldo is confident that his Portugal side will have an impact on the tournament.

'We are not favourites, but we will go and try to enjoy ourselves,' he said.

'We know we have a difficult group phase, in my opinion the strongest in the World Cup, but we will go step by step.

'We have an important game against the Germans in the first game, and then we must play Ghana and the United States to get through the group. Then we will see.'
