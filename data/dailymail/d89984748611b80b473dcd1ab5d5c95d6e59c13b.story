Daniel Sturridge proved that he doesn't just have skills on a football pitch but also in the kitchen - with a little help from his Mum.

The Liverpool striker cooked up a chicken dish specialty in preparation for Mother's Day as part of his role as a Sainsbury's ambassador.

The 25-year-old must hope that the protein-packed meal will help him when his side travel to Swansea on Monday, as they look to continue their charge for the Champions League places.

Brendan Rodgers' side have an excellent recent record against the Welsh outfit and have won their previous three games - albeit all at Anfield.

With European-chasing rivals Manchester United and Tottenham facing each other this week, Liverpool have an excellent chance of either leapfrogging Louis van Gaal's side or extending their lead of the London side.

After all the negativity surrounding the club at the start of the season, things are very much on the up for the Reds - with a Wembley appearance just one game away and momentum building for top four finish.
