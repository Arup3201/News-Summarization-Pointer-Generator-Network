Instead of showing off his huge watch collection or piles and piles of cash, Floyd Mayweather took to Instagram to flaunt another aspect of his lavish lifestyle on Tuesday morning.

The 37-year-old posted a video of himself dressed in just a pair of boxer shorts, laid on a massage table watching 10 scantily-clad women dance in front of him.

The WBC and WBA welterweight champion uploaded the clip with the message: 'If GOD made anything better than a woman, I don't want it' #mrmylifeisthes*** #tmt #tmg'

In the 15-second video, Mayweather can be seen bouncing along to rap music as he admires the ladies dressed in lingerie and bikinis. 

It's not the first time the American has given fans a glimpse of what he gets up to in his time away from the ring, with a host of pictures and clips uploaded to his popular Instagram account.

Last Saturday he shared an image of himself and his son Koraun sitting in a gold Bentley golf cart - a present for the 15-year-old.

In recent weeks Mayweather has posted videos of himself counting huge amounts of money and a picture of himself training popstar Justin Bieber.

The undefeated champion could have even more cash to play with if Manny Pacquiao beats Chris Algieri in Macau on Saturday night.

A win for the Filipino would move a mega $1billion fight between the pair even closer, with the prospect of it being shown on pay-per-view in China adding to the purse significantly.
