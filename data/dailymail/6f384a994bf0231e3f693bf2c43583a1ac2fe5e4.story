Nowhere in Germany signifies the rise of the far-Right more than Jamel in the economically-depressed east of the country.

Dotted around the tiny village, which sits in the northeastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania on the coast of the Baltic sea, are murals depicting Aryan families emblazoned with the words 'Free, Social, National', while targets showing charging soldiers are riddled with bullet holes.

The vast majority of residents are neo-Nazis - and proud of it. There have been reports of pro-Hitler parties here during the summer where attendees chant 'Heil' around a bonfire.

'Their aim? A nationalist upbringing outside the mainstream,' said German magazine Der Spiegel in a report on the rising tide of neo-Nazism.

A plaque attached to the boulder at the entrance to the village reads 'Village of Jamel - free, social, national'. According to media reports the hamlet of Jamel has been nearly entirely settled by Neo-Nazis

Jamel is close to the HQ of the German National Democratic Party (NPD), a far-Right organisation which won six per cent of votes in local elections and has five MPs in the regional parliament.

The party says it rejects violence, but two years ago Sven Krueger, one of the men who first encouraged neo-Nazis to move to Jamel and an elected representative of the NPD, was jailed for four years for possession of a machine gun and a handgun.

Stefan Koester, a regional MP for the NPD, told the Sunday Telegraph: 'Many people want a different kind of politics. A politics which is social, family-friendly.

'Many of the occupants have their own views, and don't want to pretend what views they have.'

The few residents who don't share their extremist views are reportedly subject to harassment and vandalism.

The village is a troubling reminder for a country currently bracing itself for the shocking trial of a neo-Nazi accused of helping to murder eight men of Turkish extraction.

Beate Zschaepe, 38, from Jena in east Germany, has been implicated in the shootings carried out by the National Socialist Underground, a neo-Nazi cell.

She is charged with complicity in the shooting of the eight men, as well as a Greek and a German policewoman, in towns across Germany between 2000 and 2007, as well as two bombings in immigrant areas of Cologne and 15 bank robberies.

The case is expected to expose grievous police and intelligence failings in allowing the NSU cell – comprising Zschaepe and her two lovers – to allegedly operate for so long, especially as they were under covert surveillance for much of the time that the murders were under way.

There is a feeling in Germany that the 
authorities did not take the murders seriously because the victims were 
foreigners and that the country has been ‘blinded’ to the threat of violent neo-Nazism.

The cell imploded after a botched bank robbery in November 2011, 13 years after they went underground to live from the proceeds of similar heists across the country.

Her male accomplices, Uwe Mundlos and Uwe Boehnhardt, both died – Mundlos shot Boehnhardt before turning the gun on himself.

German authorities are becoming increasingly concerned with the rise of the far-Right in Germany.

Government figures say there more than 17,000 crimes last year were attributed to the Far Right, 842 of which were violent.

There are an estimated 22,000 extremists and nearly half are estimated to be violent by security services.

Germany also has a number of summer camps and special schools brainwashing youngsters into worshipping a movement that killed six million Jews in the Holocaust.

A raid in 2011 on one camp turned up jigsaw puzzles showing Germany's pre-Second World War borders and colouring books where children were encouraged to crayon in the moustache of Hitler.

Government officials say that 'several thousand' households in Germany are now raising their children to admire the Nazis.

Worry: There is increasing concern that German children are being brainwashed by neo-Nazis who send them on Hitler-worshipping summer camps, much like those experienced by the Hitler Youth
