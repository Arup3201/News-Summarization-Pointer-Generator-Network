In a career which spanned five decades, Lynda Bellingham - best known as the 'Oxo mum' thanks to the long-running series of adverts - was loved for her frank and funny style.

It was with the same upbeat humour that she spoke about dealing with 'that curveball' of terminal illness, after she was diagnosed with colon cancer little over a year ago.

In a series of typically open interviews, she fought her cancer in the public eye, talking honestly about her illness, her decision to stop her treatment, and her wish for one last Christmas with her family.

But it was not to be, and the mother-of-two died in her husband Michael's arms on Sunday.

In a series of typically open interviews, she fought her cancer in the public eye, talking honestly about her illness, her decision to stop her treatment, and her wish for one last Christmas with her family

She was born Meredith Lee Hughes in Montreal, Quebec, on May 31, 1948, but grew up near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire after she was adopted by a British couple - only discovering the truth when in her teens.

The star, best known for playing the Oxo mother in a series of adverts for the stock cubes, was a regular on our screens for decades as the wholesome middle-class gravy-making matriarch.

She once joked that while no 'half respected actor' would have considered the role, it had afforded her a 'nice house, and school for her children'.

She got her first taste of stage success at school before going on to study at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London, followed by a steady succession of roles in theatre, film and television.

She also starred as Helen Herriot in All Creatures Great And Small, alongside Christopher Timothy, who described the actress as 'a real friend'

'She was a life force. She was funny, she was loyal, talented and a great mum,' he told the BBC.

She also took the title role in sitcom Faith In The Future, and on stage, she appeared at the Old Vic and the Royal Court and in the West End production of Calendar Girls.

Married three times. Ms Bellingham had two sons and was awarded an OBE in 2013 for her charity work.

Bellingham was one of the presenters of ITV's Loose Women and in one of her final broadcasts told her co-hosts she was 'in a good place' when she made the decision to stop treatment, saying: 'It is essential to feel you have some control of your life.'

In an emotional message, she told viewers: 'Grasp it all, don't be afraid, enjoy the bits you can and tell your family you love them while you have the chance.'

The actress and presenter insisted death should be confronted and discussed and made it her mission to transform it into a 'positive' thing.

Her autobiography, called There's Something I've Been Dying To Tell You, was published just 10 days ago.

Bellingham, whose sister Barbara died from lung cancer, had been a high-profile supporter of Cancer Research UK and Macmillan Cancer Support.

The actress, who was adopted, published a best-selling memoir, Lost And Found, which dealt with her search for her birth mother.

She also wrote a novel, Tell Me Tomorrow, which was published last year.

Bellingham married her third husband, property developer Michael Pattemore, on her 60th birthday.

Her decision to end her treatment was revealed in a serialisation of her forthcoming autobiography.

She had said she hoped to see one last Christmas.

Bellingham said: 'The decision to give up chemo was a huge relief because I took back some control of myself. It's there on the table if I want it.

'I don't want the boys or my husband to see me die a little sad old lady. I want to go out there as I am.'

She said she wanted her autobiography to be 'uplifting', adding: 'I wrote the book for everybody out there.

'It's not supposed to be an embarrassing account of me having terminal cancer.

'I wanted to write it for everybody who is given that curveball and say of course there are no answers but, if you can, take it and make it positive and talk about dying.

'If two people read this book and think 'Actually, that's how I feel and I'm not on my own', then I'll have done something half-decent.'

She filmed a special farewell episode of Loose Women, which will air on Wednesday, in which she received a standing ovation.

In a statement on behalf of Bellingham's family, Sue Latimer said: 'Lynda died peacefully in her husband's arms yesterday evening at a London hospital. Her family, to whom she was devoted, would like to thank the nurses and staff for their tremendous care and support.

'As an actor, writer and presenter, Lynda was a consummate professional to the very end.

'Those of us privileged to have known her personally will miss the entertaining, life-enhancing, true and honest friend that blessed our lives.'

Her first marriage, to film producer Greg Smith, fell apart due to his series of affairs and her second, a 16-year marriage to Italian restaurateur Nunzio Peluso with whom she had two sons, Michael, 31, and Robbie, 27, was abusive.

She later campaigned against domestic violence was awarded an OBE in 2013 for her charity work.

In 2008 she married her third husband, mortgage broker Michael Pattemore, who has since been described as 'her rock'.

She was appointed an OBE in January this year for her voluntary service to charitable giving.

Bosses of the children's charity she helped set up today paid tribute to her campaign work with young victims of domestic abuse.

Sharon Evans, chief executive of the Dot Com Children's Foundation, said her friend kept helping other people right up until her death.

Ms Evans said: 'It is incredibly sad that Lynda, who was my dear friend and patron of our charity, died so young.

'I met Lynda during a police campaign against domestic violence 12 years ago and she went on to help me launch the Dot Com Learning programme.

'She was a powerful children's champion and she went on trying to help people right until the end.'

She said Miss Bellingham was driven by her past experiences, adding: 'The programme helps prevent children from suffering violence and abuse and Lynda was passionate about children being safe having seen how her own children were affected by the violence in her first marriage.

'We loved her very much.'
