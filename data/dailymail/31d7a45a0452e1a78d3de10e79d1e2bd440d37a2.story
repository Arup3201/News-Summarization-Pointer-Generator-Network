Complete chaos descended on Sydney Airport after the domestic terminal shut down for more than three hours today due to a power outage, causing long delays and cancellations of flights for thousands of disgruntled passengers.

Power has now been fully restored at the T2 terminal and security screening has recommenced while airlines are back operating check-in counters and facilities. Jetstar advises passengers on flights that weren't cancelled, to head to the airport as scheduled, but delays were still expected.

'We are working to move passengers through the terminal as quickly as possible,' a Sydney Airport spokesperson said.

The severe delays come just as the school holidays kick in, with the power outage meaning passengers could not check in and security screening could not be carried. It is also believed some passengers were stuck inside planes due to the power cut.

The scale of the disaster is evident by the fact that free water was being handed out to the stranded thousands, while the rest of the airports across the country were expected to inevitably suffer from the flow-on effect of the delays.

The power outage happened at 8.30am this morning and staff were told at 9.30am it would be back on by 11.30 this morning. However, the airport then ordered the shutdown of lifts and elevators in an attempt to get the power up. 

The airport said the outage was caused by an issue with a substation that provides back up power to the airport.

Although the power is back on, passengers have a long wait ahead with further delays expected while the backlog is cleared
