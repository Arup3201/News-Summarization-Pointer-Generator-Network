Staring ahead: Radical Islamic Abu Hamza al-Masri poses for this mugshot following his extradition from Britain to the U.S.

Hate preacher Abu Hamza is to be given a new prosthetic hands after U.S. authorities refused to allow him to wear metal hooks in place of his missing hands when he is outside of his jail cell.

The radical Islamist cleric is facing U.S. terrorism charges after finally been extradited from Britain after an eight-year legal battle.

The Egyptian-born preacher, lost his hands and left eye after mine exploded while he was fighting the Soviet army in Afghanistan.

Hamza's lawyer, Jeremy Schneider, told reporters outside the courtroom his client would have his prosthetics changed on Tuesday.

They will be paid for by the U.S. government.

Mr Schneider said the prosthetics he is allowed to wear, only inside the maximum security jail cell where he is being held, cause pain and irritation on his skin.

'I have no idea what the new prosthetics look like,' Mr Schneider said.

Hamza, known for his signature metal hooks, appeared in court without prosthetics on Friday, his arms visibly red.

The white-haired and white bearded cleric, who has asked to be referred to in court by his birthname, Mustafa Kamel Mustafa, pleaded not guilty to 11 criminal charges on October 9.

He is being held in the maximum security section, known as South 10, of the Metropolitan Correctional Center next door to the courthouse in lower Manhattan.

Hamza was accused in 2004 of participating in hostage-taking in Yemen in 1998 that led to the deaths of three Britons and an Australian. U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest set a trial date of August 26, 2013.

He is also charged with providing material support to the al Qaeda network by trying to set up a training camp in Oregon and attempting to organize support for the Taliban in Afghanistan.

On Friday, Forrest asked both sides about the potential size and scope of the case, which spans 14 years and three continents.

Abu Hamza was arrested at his London home in May 2004.

Ironically, he was processed using 'fast track' rules which were introduced at the start of 2004 in a bid to avoid lengthy legal wrangles when extraditing to the U.S.

Previously, it took around a year for extradition to go ahead. But it would be EIGHT YEARS and five months before Hamza set foot on American soil.

By removing the need for presentation of a prima facie case it brought procedures between the UK and U.S. more in line with extradition arrangements to European countries.

But, even then, Hamza had two opportunities to appeal - and when those failed his lawyers used every excuse they could to further delay his removal from the UK for years.

The then Home Secretary, David Blunkett, boasted about the new system: 'It will mean much closer co-operation and cut out much of the paperwork which has led to unnecessary delays in the current system and allowed criminals to exploit loopholes and deliberately thwart justice.'

Federal prosecutor Edward Kim said 47 boxes of documents and evidence would need to be shipped from Britain.

Schneider requested more lawyers to work on the case and said his client would help in preparing his defense.

The
judge said the defense could have two law firm partners, two associates
and two paralegals, "resources to put on a full and fair defense."

She scheduled the next hearing for December 14.

During his initial court appearance his lawyer Sabrina Shroff asked a judge to return the metal hooks - but was turned down.

New York based prosthetic maker Arimed said the hands would be custom made for Hamza.

Non electric prosthetics costs between $5,000 and $8,000 each, while high spec models featuring sensors can cost up to $55,000.

Hamza, who faces months in jail 
before being put on trial, will be given the cheaper option, according 
to law enforcement sources.

'We have people on contract. We'd have someone come in a do it,' said a law enforcement source.

'The rule is you give the guy what they had before. Not anything better.'

Caged: While he waits to go on trial - which could take anywhere from nine months to two years - Hamza will remain in a bleak New York jail
