A patient believed to have been in a vegetative state for more than a decade has been able to communicate using the power of thought.

Scott Routley, who was left severely brain damaged after a car crash, has managed to tell his doctors he is not in any pain.

He is one of several such patients being treated using a pioneering technique developed by researchers at Cambridge University.

Incredible development: Scott Routley (pictured) has been in a vegetative state for ten years but can finally communicate - using the power of thought

Scott’s case marks the first time a patient said to be in a permanent vegetative state has been able to answer questions relating to his care – suggesting he is aware of his condition.

It also means he can communicate in a way that could help doctors improve his quality of life.

Professor Adrian Owen uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to detect changes in the flow of the blood around the brain.

Scott, from Ontario, Canada, and British patient Alex Seaman both feature in a BBC1 Panorama programme on the groundbreaking approach to brain-injured patients tonight.

Mr Routley has been able to confirm his father's name and that he has a niece

First, patients are asked to imagine they are playing tennis. This prompts an increase in blood-flow to an area at the front of the brain called the premotor cortex, which can be detected by the scan.

Patients are then told to picture themselves walking around different rooms in their house. This activates an entirely separate area of the brain, the parahippocampal gyrus, situated in the middle.

A functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) machine measure real-time activity of the brain by tracking the flow of oxygen rich blood in the brain.

Patients are asked repeatedly to imagine playing tennis or walking around their home. This demonstrates consciousness.

In healthy volunteers imagining the scenarios produces distinct patterns of activity in the brain. Scientists have matched these to a minority of severely injured patients.

Once these patterns have been established, patients can answer yes or no by imagining either walking around the home or playing tennis.

They are then asked a question and told to imagine they are playing tennis if the answer is no and if yes, to pretend they are walking round the house.

From the subsequent changes in blood flow, doctors can work out their answers.

The technique has been successfully used on a number of vegetative patients at Addenbrookes Hospital in Cambridge and by Prof Owen at the Brain and Mind Institute of Western Ontario in London, Canada.

Prof Owen said: 'Asking a patient 
something important to them has been our aim for many years. In future 
we could ask that we could do to improve their quality of life.'

Scott is the first to have been able 
to answer whether he was in pain. On two occasions in the last six 
months he has told doctors ‘no’ by imagining he was playing tennis. 
Until then patients had responded to basic questions such as ‘is your 
father’s name Alexander?’ or ‘do you have a niece?’

Doctors hope that over the coming 
weeks Scott will be able to answer questions such as what time he 
prefers to be bathed or given his dinner.

His family also want to know whether he likes listening to ice hockey on the radio.

‘Scott
 has been able to show he has a conscious, thinking mind,’ Professor 
Owen said. ‘We have scanned him several times and his pattern of brain 
activity shows he is clearly choosing to answer our questions. We 
believe he knows who and where he is.’

Scott's parents said they always thought he was conscious and could communicate by lifting a thumb or moving his eyes, but this was never accepted by medical staff.

Professor
 Bryan Young of University Hospital in London, Ontario, who has been 
Scott’s neurologist for a decade, said: ‘He had the clinical picture of a
 typical vegetative patient – no emotional response, no fixation or 
following with his eyes. He didn’t have any spontaneous movements that 
looked meaningful and I was quite impressed and amazed that he was able 
to show these cognitive responses with fMRI.’

The medical team use brain scanning to detect hidden awareness in patients and to enable them to communicate

The Canadian was asked to imagine playing tennis if he wanted to answer no to various questions while he was in an MRI scanner

Not all vegetative patients can respond using this technique as it requires so much concentration. Professor Owen says that about one in five who have scans can answer questions.

Alex de Martelly Seaman, 20, suffered severe brain injuries last year when he jumped off a moving bus. He had to have a large section of his skull removed due to internal bruising.

Alex was too ill to have a full assessment at the Royal Hospital for Neuro-disability in Putney, which collaborates with the team at Cambridge University. However, despite appearing vegetative his brain scans show he is minimally conscious. He has some periods of awareness and may be able to recognise the faces of his family and friends.

Scott was left severely brain damaged in a car crash 10 years ago

His parents were convinced he was conscious and trying to respond by moving his thumb, but medical staff didn't believe them

He has now managed to communicate with doctors by imagining playing tennis for 'No' and walking in his house for 'Yes'

Blood flows to different parts of the brain depending on what he imagines
