It's a small step for a human, but 48cm represents one giant leap for a guinea pig.

Gravity-defying Truffles, however, is a world record-breaker and makes light work of such challenges.

The daredevil rodent, from Rosyth in Fife, has reclaimed his place in the Guinness Book of Records, adding a massive 18cm to his previous benchmark set earlier this year.

One giant leap: Truffles mid-flight as the guinea pig breaks the Guinness world record with a jump of 48cm

Truffles will now put his paws up for retirement at the age of four, confident that his 48cm mark will finally prove too much for his competition around the world.

He became an international superstar back in March when his 30cm lunge from one box to another was recognised as a world best.

But fame and fortune brought jealousy and his rivals, some as far afield as Peru, strove to steal his record.

When they succeeded, Truffles' owner, Chloe Macari, 14, and her sister Nicole had to find a new delicacy that would encourage the guinea pig to jump further for.

So the boring old cucumber that tempted Truffles to set the 30cm record was replaced by curly kale, a form of cabbage.

And it worked - there was a moment's hesitation as Truffles teetered on the edge of the box thinking 'this is madness' before lunging forth and making the jump.

The Macari family filed the feat and again contacted Guinness with the details and camcorder footage.

And now, Truffles has received confirmation in certificate form that he is the best in the world.

Chloe's mum, Angela, said: 'He will be champ for at least a year. Chloe is ecstatic he's retained his title, but it's retirement now.'
