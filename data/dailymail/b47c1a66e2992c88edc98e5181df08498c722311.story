As Joanne Macfarlane recuperated from her kidney transplant, Gordon Henry did all he could to keep her cheerful. He held her hand and massaged her feet. He propped her up as she limped to the hospital toilet. He bought her new pyjamas and sneaked in her favourite chocolate.

To those around them, Gordon looked like a devoted partner, well versed in the idiosyncrasies that made his relationship work. But the reality was somewhat more complicated.

Gordon's role was not limited to that of self-appointed carer. He was also Joanne's kidney donor. And the two weren't lovers, but survivors of a chequered romantic history for which Gordon was desperate to make amends.

Back together: Joanne and Gordon today after her once ailing health reunited them

Twenty years earlier they had fallen in love and had a child together. But Gordon, by his own admission, had not been a good boyfriend or father and they separated when their son, Jordan, was just three months old.

They drifted further apart until Gordon discovered the extent of his ex-girlfriend's ailing health. Joanne was suffering from kidney failure and in urgent need of a transplant. Gordon - overcome with remorse for the way their relationship had ended - offered to help.

His altruism not only saved Joanne's life, but prompted an extraordinary romantic reunion. 'Gordon risked his life for me, reminding me why I loved him,' says Joanne, 44. Gordon, 54, hopes he can atone for past mistakes: 'I was so worried about Jo and couldn't stand the thought of our son growing up without his mother.'

As they were: The couple in 1994 when their son, Jordan, was born. They separated months later

Theirs is an incredible love story, as complex as it is heart-warming. The two met in Reading, in the summer of 1992 when Gordon was working in a local pub that Joanne, then 23, frequented. Their friendship blossomed into romance, with Gordon proclaiming her 'the most beautiful girl I'd ever met'.

She also had a dramatic medical history. At the age of 17, after years of health complications, she was diagnosed with kidney failure. Joanne's sister, Amanda, two years her senior, had donated her kidney and the transplant operation, in 1988, was a success.

Joanne, a pharmaceutical assistant manager from Sheffield, says: 'I was young and thought I was invicible'.

'Gordon asked if he could help. I said, without thinking, "you could give me a kidney"'

But she was told that the stress of her transplant would make falling pregnant impossible. So when the pair discovered she was expecting a baby in August 1993, both were stunned. Still, when their son Jordan was born in February 1994, they relished the prospect of parenthood.

But they underestimated the toll it would take on their relationship. Gordon was by now a pub manager, starting work at 7.30am and finishing after midnight. Gordon, for his part, does not deny being an inadequate father. 'I wasn't prepared to prioritise family,' he admits.

After three months Joanne told Gordon she'd had enough and moved out. Gordon's visits to his son dwindled, and in 1996 he moved to London to manage a different pub and fell in love with a colleague. The following year, Joanne also met a new partner.

Years went by with Gordon's only contact being in the form of a child benefit cheque. Then, in early 2003, Joanne's relationship broke down, coinciding with a sudden deterioration in her health. After coughing up blood one evening in November that year, she was admitted to Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital. Tests revealed her transplanted kidney was failing.

Grown up: Gordon admitted he wasn't prepared to prioritise family in his thirties

She felt obliged to tell Gordon, but with typical stoicism she downplayed the situation.

The reality was somewhat different. 'Within weeks, I had to give up work,' says Joanne. She was put on peritoneal dialysis - which meant her blood was cleaned through a tube in her stomach - for 90 minutes a day, and later that year moved, with Jordan, to Sheffield where her sister, Amanda, 46, lived.

It was 2006 before her condition stabilised sufficiently for her to be put on the transplant list. But there was a shortage of donors and Joanne's prospects were bleak.

The same year Gordon's nine-year relationship ended; ruined again by his workaholic tendencies. He moved back to Reading and became a courier, resuming contact with Joanne and their son, then 13, and visited them for the first time in a decade. It was a fraught meeting.

'Jordan didn't feel he needed him back and, while I no longer felt resentful, the conversation hardly flowed,' Joanne admits.

Nonetheless, the couple kept in telephone contact as Joanne's health worsened. By 2007, her weakening body was a battleground of scars from constant operations and dialysis. With no new kidney, her life expectancy was estimated at just two years. 'When I was alone I would weep,' she says.

Yet she didn't tell Gordon how she felt: 'I didnâ€™t want to worry him or warrant his pity.'

But in May 2009, Gordon finally broke through her controlled demeanour. 'He asked how I was and something inside me snapped,' says Joanne. 'I was tired of putting on a front and broke down.

'Gordon asked if he could help. I said, without thinking, "you could give me a kidney." Gordon replied "OK, I will." I was stunned but didn't believe he meant it.'

After Gordon convinced Joanne he was serious, the couple had tests for compatibility and counselling. 'We were told I could feel forever indebted or blame Gordon if the transplant failed,' Joanne says. 'Or he might feel resentful that he'd lost a kidney for nothing.'

The grim truth was that the transplant was more likely to fail than succeed; because Gordon wasn't a perfect blood match there was a 60 per cent chance Joanne's body would reject his kidney.

The transplant was booked for November 30, 2009, at Sheffield Northern General Hospital - a day neither of them will ever forget.

'Gordon has not only saved my life - he has made me love living it again'

'I tried not to show my nerves,' remembers Gordon. 'There were risks for me too, but there was no way I would back out.' Joanne also struggled to control her emotions: 'I was overwhelmed with guilt, terrified something would go wrong.'

Joanne and Gordon underwent a gruelling four-hour operation. When she came round, Gordon, still groggy from his own procedure, was wheeled in to see her.

'The operation was a success,' he says. 'Now I was determined to do everything I could to help her recover.'

As the days passed, nobody failed to notice the intimacy between the two - except the couple themselves. 'I dismissed nurses' suggestions that Gordon still had feelings for me,' says Joanne. 'Besides, I felt so weak romance was the last thing on my mind.'

After they were discharged the following week, Gordon stayed with Joanne to attend hospital appointments.

'He cooked and helped round the house,' says Joanne. 'I couldn't have coped without him.'

In love again: The couple's romance is as complex as it is heart-warming

Yet it wasn't until Gordon arrived back in Reading a month after the operation that he realised his feelings extended beyond friendship. 'I called Joanne to say I was home and as I heard her voice it dawned on me that I was in love.'

But he was reluctant to tell her how he felt. 'She needed to focus on recovering,' he explains.

It was 18 months before they met again. By August 2011, Joanne paid Gordon a visit. 'He picked me up and gave me a huge hug, and something clicked,' she says.

That evening, as they sat on Gordon's sofa, he kissed her on the lips. 'As he pulled away he murmured "I've always loved you",' she remembers. 'I told him I loved him too.'

They knew their future belonged together. Joanne admits there has been some tension between her son, now 19 and a student, and his father. 'But he's pleased that I am happy and they're growing closer.'

The couple - who split their time between Reading and Sheffield - are now deciding which city to move to together. They insist none of the issues the transplant counsellor warned them about have materialised.

'I didn't offer my kidney to get back with Jo, and she hasn't got back with me because she feels the need to repay me,' says Gordon.

Joanne will be on medication for ever. But she is buoyed by Gordon's support. 'Gordon has not only saved my life - he has made me love living it again.'
