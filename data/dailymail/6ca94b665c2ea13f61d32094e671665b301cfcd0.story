One waitress from Chicago allegedly did what most restaurant patrons wonder about but seldom actually believe happens. She's accused of adjusting almost 200 credit card tips.

Kristin Nichole Blair, 24, a server at Miller's Ale House on Olentangy River Road in Columbus, Ohio was suspectedÂ  of foul play after a customer complained that an additional $4.76 had been added to her bill on March 28.

The customer, Mark Capriotti, showed the management the tip and they launched into their own investigation and found that she may have added extra dollars to 196 credit card totals.
