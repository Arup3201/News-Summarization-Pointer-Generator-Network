In an emotional telephone reunion, Ms Berry, who lives in Tennessee, asked her granddaughter how she was before simply saying: 'I'm glad to have you back'.

Struggling to speak, Amanda replied: 'I'm glad to be back'.

In the conversation broadcast on News Net 5, Ms Berry then adds: 'I thought you were gone', and Amanda replies, 'Nope, I'm here'.

Amanda escaped from the house in Seymour Avenue on Monday - a decade after she went missing.

A neighbour helped her kick down the locked front door.

Amanda's father Johnny Berry said he always believed she was still alive because 'I know the kid's heart'

Her daughter Jocelyn, who was born in captivity, escaped with her.

She had been held with two other women Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight, who all disappeared about a decade ago when they were in their teens or early 20s. 

The two women were rescued after Amanda raised the alarm.

Ms Berry asked her Amanda if the little girl seen with her in was her daughter.

She replied: 'Yes, she's my daughter. Born at Christmas'.

Johnny Berry said he knew he would see his daughter again because she is so strong

Amanda's father Johnny Berry said he always kept faith that his daughter was alive.

He told ABC News: 'I didn't think she was dead. No, I never gave up.'

He said he knew he would see her again because she was so strong.

Mr Berry said: 'Keep hope, keep hope. Don't give up. Because I never gave up. I know the kid's heart.'

He
was told by relatives that his daughter had been found alive as he was 
recovering from back surgery at his home in Tennessee.

His ex-wife Louwana Miller had tirelessly campaigned to keep her daughter's disappearance in the public eye died in 2006 'of a broken heart'.

Mr Berry said finally hearing the news of his daughter's survival gave him the 'best feeling I've ever had.'

Ariel Castro, 52, and his 
two brothers Onil Castro, 50, and Pedro Castro, 54, have been arrested on suspicion of kidnap. 

The mother of victim Michelle Knight said that she also never gave up hope.

Michelle disappeared the day she was supposed to appear in court for a custody hearing for her young son.

However, she never arrived and police and social workers told her family that she had run away.

Today, Barbara Knight was travelling from her new home in Naples, Florida, to be reunited with the daughter she has not seen since 2002.

She said she prays that Michelle 'will come back with me so I can help her recover from what she has been through.'
