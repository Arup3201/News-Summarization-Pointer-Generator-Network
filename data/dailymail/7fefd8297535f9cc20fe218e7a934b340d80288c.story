Chris Huhne has resigned from the Liberal Democrats in the wake of his conviction, party sources said last night.

Insiders also claimed Mr Huhne’s lover, Carina Trimingham, has quit her party membership.

However, ex-wife Vicky Pryce – last week found guilty of perverting the course of justice for taking his speeding points – is still a member.

Resigned: Both Chris Huhne MP and his partner Carina Trimmingham have quit their party membership of the Liberal Democrats

Ms Pryce and her former husband are due to be sentenced tomorrow – with both expected to receive jail sentences.

Mr Huhne quit as an MP on the same day he admitted perverting the course of justice a month ago.

At the time, sources close to party 
leader Nick Clegg were reported as saying that ‘resigning as an MP is 
sufficient punishment’.

But it emerged yesterday that Mr 
Huhne resigned his membership after he was rung by a party official who 
had received ‘many calls’ about his membership.

A source said: ‘We rang him and asked him whether he was going to quit and he said yes .  .  .’

The Mail on Sunday understands Ms 
Pryce has not yet been quizzed by party officials over her membership, 
although insiders also expect her to resign.

Lib Dem internal rules say that anyone bringing the party into disrepute is liable to be expelled.

Sources said Mr Huhne was told that activating ‘arcane’ party disciplinary procedures to expel him formally could take a long time and it would be better if he quit.

News that he had been forced out emerged just as Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg heaped praise on his former Cabinet colleague.

Speaking at the party’s Brighton spring conference, he said: ‘Chris was an outstanding constituency MP, a powerful thinker and very effective Secretary of State on the green agenda before he left.’

Addressing a conference fringe meeting, Mr Clegg highlighted the fact Mr Huhne had written two chapters in a new book designed to shape the future of Lib Dem environmental policy.

Mr Clegg said: ‘The fact he has contributed on important issues is very good to see and I hope people will register that.’

The party leader has previously said he was ‘shocked and saddened’ at Mr Huhne’s fate.

But his lavish praise yesterday appeared to startle some delegates worried that the extraordinary speeding-points furore has severely damaged the party.

Assistant Chief Constable Gordon Fraser died after stepping in front of a train

The widow of a police chief will not face trial for allegedly taking his speeding points because she was left to look after their children alone when he committed suicide.

Teresa Fraser, herself a detective, had been accused of helping her husband Gordon to escape a penalty for driving too fast by falsely claiming she was at the wheel, in an echo of the Chris Huhne and Vicky Pryce case.

But Mr Fraser, 48, former Leicestershire assistant chief constable, killed himself last October by stepping in front of a train three days before the couple were due in court. He had also been under investigation over an alleged Florida timeshare fraud.

Now the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has dropped the charge of perverting the course of justice against his widow because of her personal situation.

A CPS spokesman said: ‘The CPS has considered the case against Teresa Fraser and concluded it would no longer be in the public interest to prosecute. Mr Fraser committed suicide in the run-up to the trial and Mrs Fraser was left with sole responsibility of their three young children. Consideration was given to the welfare of Mrs Fraser and her family in these very difficult circumstances.’

Mrs Fraser, 42, had been accused of ‘falsely accepting responsibility’ for a speeding offence committed by her husband in Scotland in September 2011.

Although she no longer faces criminal charges, she remains suspended from West Midlands Police as part of the investigation into the overseas property business run by her late husband.

It is claimed he borrowed from US banks to buy holiday homes then offered them for sale to police officers, but the property slump left investors out of pocket.
