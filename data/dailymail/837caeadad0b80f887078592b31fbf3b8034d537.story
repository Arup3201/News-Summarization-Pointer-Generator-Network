Justin Bieber has allegedly decided to give away his pet monkey Mally instead of rescuing it from a Munich animal clinic.

German authorities say the teen star doesn't want the Capuchin back after it was seized by customs officers from a private jet on March 28 and placed in quarantine.

They say his management team in New York contacted them this week asking if they could find a 'safe and sheltered place, or a zoo' for the lonely creature.

Stranger moments: Justin's monkey Mally was confiscated while on tour in Germany

Mally the monkey is now in quarantine at a German animal shelter

The capuchin monkey, taken from its mother at nine weeks, is treating a cuddly toy as its surrogate parent 

The star and his entourage had no paperwork or health certificates to bring Mally - just a few weeks old - into the country.

After a night spent at an airport quarantine centre, Mally was moved into the care of vets at a clinic in the city.

'We have to discuss now the way forward with customs officials and other responsible departments,' said a clinic spokesman. The statement from 19-year-old Bieber's people in New York thanked the Munich authorities for the 'caring support' offered to Mally.

Franz Böhmer of the Bonn Federal Office for Nature Conservation said: 'So far no papers for the monkey of Justin Bieber have been submitted.

If he submits a written disclaimer, we can accommodate Mally in a welfare family group in a zoo.'

Authorities in Germany have given Bieber a deadline of May 17 to either claim Mally - and pay thousands of pounds towards his upkeep - or to send a letter saying he no longer wants him.

Karl Heinz Joachim, the boss of the animal centre where Mally is living, said; 'The baby monkey needs company and to be with other monkeys at this crucial age in its life.

'There are a great many suitable places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind.'

He added: 'A baby monkey was never going to be suited to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet. He should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in life.'

Bild newspaper in Germany commented; 'It sounds like the end of a monkey love.'

The boss of the Munich animal shelter asked Bieber to do 'the decent thing' and let the animal be adopted

Mally spends his time repeatedly calling in the hope of finding other members of his family group, animal shelter staff said

Mally, a capuchin
 monkey, was given to the singer for his 19th birthday last month from 
music producer Jamal 'Mally Mal' Rashid. He had been taken away from his
 mother when he was only nine weeks old.

Normally capuchin monkeys remain with their mothers for at least the first year of their life.

Mally is said to spend his time repeatedly calling out in the hope of finding 
other members of his family group - something which animal shelter boss 
Karl Heinz Joachim, 64, described as 'heartbreaking'.

He
 said: 'Justin Bieber has won an extension because the four week limit 
on confiscated animals only applies if the owner does not get in touch. 

'However
 his management team had been in touch and indicated that they want the 
monkey back which means they now have as much time as they need to get 
the paperwork ready.

'If
 that takes months then it's months that they have. But that just isn't 
acceptable for the baby monkey needs company and to be with other 
monkeys at this crucial age in its life.

'We'll appeal to the star to do the decent thing and let the monkey be free for adoption.

'There are a great many suitable places that have offered to take Mally and integrate him with their own capuchin monkeys where he would be much more happy with his own kind.

'A baby monkey is not something suitable to be on a world tour even if he is travelling by private jet.

'He should be out in the wild climbing trees and learning from other monkeys if he isn't to have serious psychological problems later in life.'

A source familiar with the situation 
has previously told MailOnline: 'There are ongoing discussions to ensure the best 
conditions for the monkey.'

A German customs spokesman said at the time of the confiscation that Bieber lacked documents certifying compliance with animal health and species-protection regulations.
