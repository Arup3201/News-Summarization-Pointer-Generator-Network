A couple are bulldozing their £450,000 luxury home and building a caravan site after failing to find a buyer because they live next to a gypsy camp.

Phil and Kathleen Lacey put their four-bedroom country bungalow up for sale when their grown-up children moved out.

But when people viewed the property they were put off by a gypsy caravan site which has spread out alongside their home.

Bulldozed: Phil and Kathleen Lacey are planning to flatten their home of 25 years in the village of Shirenewton, near Cardiff

The couple are now planning to flatten their home of 25 years, and businessman Mr Lacey will develop the land into a caravan site of their own to collect rent from the pitches.

Mr Lacey, 54, said: 'We can’t sell it because of the locality of the travellers’ site.

'We had a lot of responses because it’s a lovely house - but I think nobody fancied living next door to the caravan site.

'If this place was anywhere else it would probably be worth £750,000.

'But it’s 'location location location' which is disappointing.'

Not a selling point: Mr Lacey said: 'We can't sell it because of the locality of the travellers' site. We had a lot of responses because it's a lovely house - but I think nobody fancied living next door to the caravan site'

The couple say they are not moving 
because of any problems with the gypsy community at the official 
travellers’ site in the village of Shirenewton, near Cardiff.

Father-of-four
Mr Lacey said: 'We don’t want anybody to think we are leaving here 
because of the travellers - they will always be friends of ours.

'We have had 25 years here. If we had a problem we would have moved ages ago.'

The Laceys say they will be heartbroken to demolish their family home which has four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a sun room overlooking picturesque countryside.

The couple have submitted plans to construct 11 caravan plots, including concrete hardstandings and amenity blocks.

And they plan to manage the one-acre site and rent private plots to the travelling community.

The council-run travellers’ site was set up in 1985 and is home to 300 residents on 55 hard-standing units.

Gypsies at the site yesterday welcomed Mr Lacey’s plans saying they need twice the space to accommodate people wishing to move to Shirenewton.

Travellers on the site said it was a form of racism that people lost interest in the Lacey’s bungalow when they discovered the caravan site next door.

A mother-of-two living on the site said: 'People are never going to change their minds, because it has been like this for the last hundred years.'

Cardiff Council will discuss the proposals for extending the caravan site next month.
