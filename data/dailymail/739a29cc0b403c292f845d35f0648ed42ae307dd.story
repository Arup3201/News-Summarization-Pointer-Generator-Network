Premier League stars Eden Hazard, Thibaut Courtois and Adnan Januzaj were among 10 Belgium players to squeeze into Vincent Kompany’s impromptu team photo. 

The Manchester City centre back posted the team bus line-up on his Instagram account.

Kompany and his fellow Belgians were clearly in buoyant form after seeing off minnows Andorra 6-0 in their opening Euro 2016 qualifying game.

It was the first competitive encounter for Marc Wimots' side since their World Cup quarter-final loss to Argentina in Brazil. 

The Belgians were originally set to open their campaign with a trip to Israel, but the match scheduled in September was postponed due to the Gaza conflict. 

Chelsea star Hazard sat out the encounter with bruised toe but is expected to fit for his side’s next qualifier against Bosnia on Monday.
