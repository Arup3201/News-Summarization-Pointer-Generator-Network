Pirelli has opted to alter its tyre choice for the upcoming Brazilian Grand Prix after the original decision was branded as 'dangerous' by Felipe Massa.

The Italian tyre manufacturer had initially opted for the medium and hard compounds of rubber for the Interlagos circuit.

Williams driver Massa, however, was typically outspoken on the matter as he claimed the choice was 'totally unacceptable'.

Felipe Massa described Pirelli's first choice of tyres for his home Grand Prix as 'very dangerous'

Although Massa's remarks cut no ice with Pirelli motorsport director Paul Hembery, he recognised the fact recent resurfacing works could have a bearing.

After consulting with all 11 teams via F1's Tyre Working Group, Pirelli will now run the soft and medium compounds for the race on November 9.

Hembery said: 'We've always said we would be open to any changes if they were required.

'After further technical analysis of the impact of the revised circuit surface, together with a risk assessment suggesting a low probability of compound overheating due to extreme track temperatures, we have made this change with the unanimous agreement of all 11 teams.'

Paul Hembery, Pirelli motorsport director, said the company were always open to a change of compound
