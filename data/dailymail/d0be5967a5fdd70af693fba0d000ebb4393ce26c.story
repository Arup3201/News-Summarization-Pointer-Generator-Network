Britain’s oldest gardener still enjoys growing vegetables and tending to his flowers at the admirable age of 104.

Ralph Hoare took up gardening nearly a century ago and cites pottering around his plants as the key to his long life.

The great-grandfather keeps around 200 rose bushes in his garden in Longlevens, Gloucestershire, which he tends to himself since the death of his wife Dorothy in 2007.

Green life: Ralph Hoare, pictured with one of his helpful great-granddaughters in his garden, is Britain's oldest gardener turning 105 this year

Despite weak knees he refuses to give up his passion, securing the help of his great-grandchildren aged four and six, to prune his plants.

The former bank worker and RAF veteran took up gardening in 1914, aged six, and is now set to share almost a century of experience with the Twitter generation.

After he was identified as the UK's oldest active gardener by retailer Furniture Village he is to become an online expert on nation's horticultural questions on the social network.

The former bank worker and RAF veteran will answer questions posted with the hashtag #askralph from tomorrow, inbetween tending to his own garden and planning for his 105th birthday party in July.

Flower power: Ralph has a passion for roses and his garden is home to over 200 varieties, as well as his vegetable patches where he grows potatoes, onions and broccoli

Mr Hoare said:‘The thought of my garden in bloom gives me the willpower to continue through the winter.

‘Gardening keeps me on the move and my mind active.’

‘The seed potatoes are sprouting in the spare bedroom and I am waiting for some dry weather for the onion sets.’

Veteran: Ralph, pictured with his mother in a garden as a young child, has been gardening since he was six years old

Born in Plymouth in 1908, Mr Hoare 
grew up in Devon where he remembers his earliest gardening experience of
growing Japanese anemones.

He has kept the garden at his Longlevens home himself since the death of his wife Dorothy in 2007.

‘She used to do all the weeding and I did the planting, pruning and digging,’ he said.

The couple, married in 1940 at St John's Church in Taunton, Somerset, had two children and Mr Hoare is now grandfather to six and great-grandfather to a further six children.

He said: ‘Now that my knees are not so good, I have to garden standing up and by asking other people to do things for me.

‘I use a hoe for weeding and a grabber for picking things up from the ground.

'I also spend more time just wandering through the paths, admiring and smelling the roses and making mental notes of what has to be done.

‘My two eldest great grand-daughters, aged six and four, have become proficient in deadheading the roses, under supervision of course.’

Mr Hoare said his favourite rose is Papa Meilland because of its dark red colour and strong scent.

He also has a vegetable garden where he grows potatoes, onions, runner beans and broccoli.

Friends and family will mark his 105th birthday with a party in Mr Hoare's garden.

Members of the public can put questions to Mr Hoare via the Furniture Village Twitter account or their Facebook page.
