Few would expect sewage work to generate you more money than the combined pay of your city’s mayor, head of police and schools chief.

But Gerald Mistretta, of Brooklyn, was one of seven New York City sewage workers to earn an astonishing pay of more than $700,000 last year.

The senior engineer earned an incredible $771,841 in 2010 after a wage settlement with the city that saw him receive almost $500,000 in back pay.

Father-of-three Mr Mistretta received a basic annual salary of $109,850 and $173,000 in overtime, reported the New York Daily News.

It made him the top earner among city employees in 2010, but he said he has suffered a ‘difficult period’ of 16 years without a pay increase.

‘I know it looks like a whole lot of money,’ he told the New York Daily News. ‘But people don't realise the hardships we went through.

‘Imagine in 2009 still making what you made in 1993?’

He has worked without a contract since 1995 after a salary dispute - until a deal struck two years ago gave him the increase he wanted.

As well as the seven senior Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) workers who made more than $700,000, others have also benefitted.

Thirteen took home pay in the $600,000 range, and 47 earned from $400,000 up to that level, reported the New York Daily News.

A DEP spokesman told the New York Daily News he was pleased the agreement was reached, so the labourers can now focus on their work.

New York City Fire Department radio repair mechanics also won a settlement against the city last year, which saw pay rises for 150 workers.
