Police say a Pennsylvania substitute teacher bought pictures of nude female students from one of their classmates.

Jon Serianni, 41, was charged Tuesday with child pornography and corruption of minors after investigators searched his phone and found 190 pictures of girls who were nude or in sexually explicit poses.

The Emporium man was a substitute high school teacher in the Cameron County School District when he allegedly overheard some male students discussing the pictures. 

Serianni then texted one of the boys and offered to pay for some of them. 

Charged: Jon Serianni, 41, from Emporium, faces child pornography and corruption of minors charges. He was a substitute teacher within the Cameron County School District and allegedly bought naked photos of a female student off a boy in class

He allegedly offered the boy between $15 to $25 per image.

Word of the transaction then got back to the female juvenile, The Bradford Era reported.

The male student was interviewed by police with his mother present and admitted to sending Serianni the pictures. 

The boy tells police he received less than $300 from Serianni.

A subsequent search warrant served on Serianni's house produced the additional images.

Police seized several items from the home, including console and handheld video game systems, more than 20 compact discs, eight digital memory cards/flash drives, two external hard drives, two laptop computers and several cameras.

Scene: A substitute teacher from Cameron County was arrested after police say they found dozens of photos of underage girls nude or in sexually explicit positions on the teacher's phone

Caught: Police allege a student sold Serianni some photographs and that they were of female students

Serianni may face further charges. 

Defense attorney David Shrager says he's just begun investigating the charges. 

Serianni is expected at a preliminary hearing on January 22 at the Cameron County Courthouse.
