There are countless lights designed to fool thieves into thinking you’re home when on holiday or out for the evening.

But this latest gadget mimics the flickering glow of a TV to add an extra level of deception.

It’s called the Intruder Discouraging Television Mimic and sensors can turn the 3.25-inch (8cm) display on and off automatically.

The Intruder Discouraging Television Mimic light (pictured) is on sale from New York-based Hammacher Schlemmer. It has a small LED display that mimics a TV’s glow and sensors automatically turn it on at dusk

The $49.95 (£32) device is on sale from New York-based retailer Hammacher Schlemmer and can be shipped in the US and internationally for an extra $11.95 (£7.80).

As well as adding a flickering light, the small LED display simulates scene changes, fades and colours in the same way a traditional TV would.

The mimic light can even be set so it turns on automatically at dusk, and then scheduled to turn off after two, four or six hours.

Alternatively, users can switch it on manually and it will run continuously until it is switched off.

The light measures 4.25 inches (11cm) long, 3.25-inches (8cm) wide and 2.75-inches (7cm) deep.

It weighs 6oz (170g) ounces and is powered by a standard wall plug, meaning it can be placed in any room of the house.

‘This device mimics the flickering glow of a television to dissuade burglars who may be sizing up potential homes for thievery,’ said Hammacher Schlemmer.

‘Its built-in microchip simulates the scene changes, fades, swells, and colour shifts of a TV as perceived from outside using a bright multi-colour LED display diffused with an opalescent lens.

‘It can be used in any room of the house that you would prefer and it does not need to be pointed at a curtain.

‘It can be set on a shelf or secured to a wall with the included hanging hole or its integrated mounting tape.'

BeOn bulbs learn your habits and replicates them when you’re on holiday, it stores energy in reserve, and it responds to doorbells and smoke alarms

BeOn bulbs learn your habits and replicates them when you’re on holiday, it stores energy in reserve, and it responds to doorbells and smoke alarms.

They’re not cheap - prices start at $199 (£124) for three - but they are seen as an alternative to installed security systems.

Sensors in the BeOn bulb learns a homeowner’s lighting habits and can replicate them when the user is on holiday, to give the illusion they are home.

The bulbs can be set to switch on and off when they hear the sound of a doorbell, or smoke alarm, to alert homeowners in the middle of the night, or if they’re TV is up too loud.

Alternatively, if a burglar rings the bell to see if anyone is home, the lights turn on automatically to scare them off.

The bulbs store a reserve of energy, in case of a power cut, and will gradually fade on and off to avoid being blinded first thing in the morning, for example.

Homeowners can additionally control the lights using a smartphone app, and the energy-saving bulbs use soft white LEDs with a brightness of 800 lumens.

This is the equivalent to a 60 watt incandescent bulb.
