They've been under the full glare of the spotlight amid rumors of an impending split.

And after coming to the end of their tour, billion dollar couple Beyoncé and Jay Z have holed up in the celebrity enclave of Malibu.

And the five-week break that leads up to two final tour dates in Paris next month may be just what the doctor ordered as a relaxed-looking Beyoncé is pictured with a glass of wine and gazing out at the sunshine in a tender photo taken by Jay Z.

As MailOnline reported, Jay Z is desperate to spend the five-week break with his wife - and it looks like they're off to a good start as the pair are believed to have enjoyed dinner together at Nobu Malibu last night.

Jay, 44, who can be glimpsed in the door's reflection taking his wife's picture, has embarked on a bid to save his marriage, as a source said: 'He adores his daughter Blue Ivy and he wants a sibling for her, but Beyoncé isn't sure what she wants to do  - their marriage is in flux, that's the truth. Jay just wants them to spend some time alone together to try and work it out.

'And it's not just throwing away a marriage - it's throwing away a brand. But it may be that Bey has just had enough. She has some trust issues with Jay.'

And E! news today reported that Jay Z is 'pulling out all the stops' to save his marriage, with another source admitting: 'There has been talk of divorce and it's been really tense at times on the tour.

'Beyoncé has been leaning on her mom and sister a lot since they are so close. Jay wants everything to work out and is trying to convince Beyoncé how much he does not want a divorce. It's flowers, constant texts and telling her he loves her. He is pulling out all the stops.'

Beyoncé is torn because she loves Jay so much and wants to keep their family together. She's turning to family and God to help her through it.'

Meanwhile,
 Beyoncé - who also posted a picture of her with daughter Blue Ivy on the beach - seemed keen on showing her loyalty to her 
husband as she donned nothing but a 'Carter' jersey in a sexy snap 
shared on Instagram on Saturday.

The 32-year-old singer-songwriter displayed her shapely legs as she struck a seductive pose.

In one image, the Drunk In Love singer's back is turned to the camera as she casts a come-hither gaze over her shoulder.

In the adjacent photo, she faces forward, looking on more innocently, with one hand resting on her head.

 the number four and her husband's last name, which she has taken.

Red hot! Beyoncé, 32, and Jay Z, 44, put on an intimate performance in San Francisco on Wednesday

The
 mother-of-one wore her hair in braids and glammed up the look with a 
thick gold chain necklace, a gold cuff bracelet, and numerous bangle 
bracelets.

She
 is likely in a celebratory mood, having wrapped the North American leg 
of her and her husband's On The Run joint world tour in San Francisco on
 Wednesday.

Beyoncé
 and Jay Z gave no indication of trouble as they left the trendy San 
Francisco restaurant, Boulevard, on Wednesday following lunch with their
 two-year-old daughter Blue Ivy.

Thankful: The Partition hitmaker shared this photo Thursday, writing, 'Thank you San Fran! ...It was the perfect place to complete the best tour of my life! Thank you to all the fans that supported our show...'

There
 were no signs of marital discord between them as they left the stage 
that night at AT&T Park and joined friends for dinner at Tosca Cafe 
before retiring to their Presidential Suite at the St. Regis hotel suite
 together in the early hours of Wednesday morning.

On
 Thursday, Beyoncé Instagrammed a photo of Jay Z holding Blue Ivy, about
 to board a plane, along with a big 'thank you' to the people of San 
Francisco.

'Thank
 you San Fran! Your city is beautiful,' the Partition hitmaker wrote. 
'It was the perfect place to complete the best tour of my life! Thank 
you to all the fans that supported our show. God bless.'

Just for appearances? The couple looked loved up on stage at the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles earlier this month

They will complete two final shows in Paris on September 12 and 13, which will be recorded for an HBO special next month.

It
 was said that their relationship is in so much trouble that bigwigs 
from HBO, concert promoters at Live Nation and lawyers were called into a
 crisis meeting last week - prompting fears the billion-dollar couple 
could pull out of their dates in the City of Light. 

However,
 a spokesman for HBO confirmed to MailOnline the network will shoot the 
dates in France and air the concert on September 20.

Meanwhile, the power couple’s tour stylist June Ambrose described their sense of style.

'Beyoncé’s fashion is like Vogue couture, Jay is more like the best accessory — very laid back, has a little bit of street edge, but still the sense of glamour to it,' she told People.

June gushed about seeing them in performance together.

'They’re hard workers, and they’re two extraordinary artists and the dynamic to me is one of the best tours I’ve seen in years.

'It was shocking to me because you’ve seen both of those tours separately so you’re like, "What are they going to do?" But they really pulled off an amazing, amazing, riveting, sexy, provocative, edgy show.'
