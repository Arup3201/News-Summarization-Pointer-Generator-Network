A nasty polar vortex that wreaked havoc on the east coast in January is making a shock return next week - though don't pull out your puffer coat just yet.

Unseasonably chilly air is headed for parts of the northern and northeastern U.S. where residents have been sweltering in 90 degree weather this week - as one would expect in July.

Thankfully, families won't be plunged into the despair they endured during January's brutally cold weather pattern.

But the looming conditions bear some resemblance, so much so that meteorologists are dubbing this the polar vortex sequel.

Polar vortex: A cold front set to hit the Midwest next week is NOT another polar vortex, just unseasonably chilly weather

According to the Washington Post, a deep pool of cool air from Alaska and Canada will plunge into the Great Lakes early next week.

From there it'll move towards the east coast.

Because we're in July - the peak of summer - rather than bitter mid-winter, temperatures are expected to drop 10-30 degrees below average, so the polar vortex's 'lite' won't have quite the same effect.

But it certainly will be chilly than normal, requiring hoodies and jeans in parts of the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest where the coolest air is expected and highs are forecast to be in the 60s and 70s tops - a sharp difference from the 80s and 90s of recent weeks.

On Wednesday morning, the lows may drop into the 40s over a large part of the central U.S., which is extremely unusual in July.

According
 to the Post, the coolest temps will likely miss the east coast, but 
highs are still forecast to be 10 degrees below normal, struggling to 
reach 80 in D.C. next Tuesday and Wednesday with widespread lows in the 
50s.

The relatively cooler air may also be felt in New York, according to ABC News.

The brief weather pattern could even break records around the Plains and Great Lakes.

Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters told the Post that Japan's typhoon Neoguri is playing a role in how the polar vortex is coming together.

'.... the large and powerful nature of this storm has set in motion a chain-reaction set of events that will dramatically alter the path of the jet stream and affect weather patterns across the entire Northern Hemisphere next week,' he said.

'Neoguri will cause an acceleration of the North Pacific jet stream, causing a large amount of warm, moist tropical air to push over the North Pacific. This will amplify a trough low pressure over Alaska, causing a ripple effect in the jet stream over western North America, where a strong ridge of high pressure will develop, and over the Midwestern U.S., where a strong trough of low pressure will form.'
