No matter where he goes, Luis Suarez is the centre of attention.

The Barcelona striker may have thought he could have escaped the limelight in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia but he was rumbled by a quick-thinking taxi driver.

Suarez is in the Middle East for a friendly with Uruguay but the 27-year-old didn't appear to be enjoying his journey.

The unnamed driver, however, was clearly enjoying the fact that one of the world's best footballers was in his cab.

As part of his ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup, Suarez is banned from Uruguay's next eight competitive games. 

He can play in friendlies, though, and is expected to start Friday's game against Saudi Arabia.
