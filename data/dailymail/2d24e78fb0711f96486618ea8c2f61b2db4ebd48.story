A breathtaking new time-lapse video shows Queensland's iconic Gold Coast in an entirely new, and particularly stunning light.

From the bright city lights bursting from buildings to the sun shining through the canopy in a secluded rainforest, the film showcases what the city with a whole lot of character really has to offer.

Commissioned by Gold Coast Tourism, the feature was shot by Joe Capra over a period of two weeks and aims to showcase all the Gold Coast is famous for, from it's stunning beaches to its bustling nightlife.

The film took more than two weeks to shoot all the footage for and features scenes in a serene rainforest

The film begins with a calm but bright sunrise over the beach, with the waves softly rolling onto the shore as the clouds part while the sun climbs higher into the sky.

From there you are relocated to a rocky shore spotting early morning surfers and swimmers alike. Aerial shots feature heavily in the video, giving the feeling that the camera is perched atop one of the city's many skyscrapers.

Vibrant colours and reflections from the water that surrounds the beachside area slide across the screen before a drastic change of scenery.

The serenity of a secluded rainforest takes over, a stark contrast to the busy urban landscape visible moments before.

Sunlight streams through the gaps between the trees, before the camera moves on to a secret lagoon sheltered by rocks overhead.

Over the past few years, the Gold Coast has often been in the limelight for reasons other than what it has to offer as a tourist destination.

Recently the Gold Coast has copped a bad reputation for the chaos that ensues during Schoolies (left) and the idea that bikies had somewhat overrun the city (right)

From the idea that the area has been somewhat overrun with bikie gangs and associated crimes, to the fact that the place is sprawling with teenagers celebrating Schoolies every summer - the place doesn't always get the best reviews.

But this video shows the seaside city in a renewed light, and aims to bring people back to the beauty and remind them there is still much fun to be had.

The film is full of contrasts between the city skyline and the natural wonders the Gold Coast harbours, like the stunning beaches that span the city's shorelines.

People paddleboard and surf across the screen, while others lay soaking up the sun on the sand. As the sun begins to sink to the other side of the day, buildings and the sea glisten with the last light.

The Gold Coast then comes alive for a second time, as the buildings light up and the skyline glows in preparation for the evening ahead.

The video closes on a the same beach where it all begun, and it gives the feeling you have just spent a whirlwind day on the Gold Coast all wrapped up into a four minute flashback.
