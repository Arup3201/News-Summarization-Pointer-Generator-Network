There have been some scary times for Arsenal so far this season, with injury crisis after crisis, and only three league wins in their first nine games.

And the Gunners were in for a different kind of fright on Friday, with several first-teamers getting dressed up for Halloween in a new video for the club's official channel.

Second-choice goalkeeper David Ospina, who is currently out injured and unlikely to play until the new year, stars in the clip as a vampire.

England full back Kieran Gibbs and Czech midfielder Tomas Rosicky also feature prominently, as a skeleton and zombie. 

And Nacho Monreal, who has been filling in at centre back in the absence of Laurent Koscielny also got involved, dressed in black robes and looking as scared as when facing a pacey forward.

Arsene Wenger will hope that his players get over their fears on Halloween, and are back focused in time for Burnley on Saturday afternoon.
