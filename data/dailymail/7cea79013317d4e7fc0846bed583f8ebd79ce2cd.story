At just 4ft 6in tall, Xiong Chaogui has faced his share of discrimination. In 1983 he was denied a chance to go to university because of his height.

He was stuck apparently without prospects in his impoverished village of Yaolong, in Maguang, a county of south-west China's Yunnan Province. But he did not allow the knock-back to make him bitter.

Mr Xiong has instead dedicated his life to helping others whose small size has rendered them second-class citizens in China's ruthless economic boom: the children left behind.

Pint-sized: Chinese headteacher Xiong Chaogui is, at 4ft 6in tall, shorter than many of his young charges. Because of a shortage of teachers in his local area, he also teaches mathematics at his school

The issue of left-behind children is a massive and growing problem in China. 

With the country's urbanisation, millions of farmers have been forced to take up jobs in the city to survive, leaving their children at home.

According to a report released by All China Women's Federation in 2013, the number of left-behind children in China had reached more than 60million.

Two years after he was refused a place at university, in 1985, Mr Xiong started his first class for left-behind children. 

In 1989, he was hired for a teaching job by a local elementary school, and in 2007 he was elected the headmaster of Yao Long Elementary School.

Mr Xiong is not only the headmaster but, due to a lack of teaching staff, also teaches maths at the school.

Yaolong village has a population of 3,357, most of them are ethnic minorities. The village is famous for its poverty and remoteness.

Most of its adults have left home to find work in cities, leaving behind only old people and children.

The school now has a total of 279 students, with 169 boarders who live more than 45 minutes' walk away. 

Among the boarding students, there are also 50 pre-school age students, whose parents left them to Mr Xiong's care.

Mr Xiong said: 'The school has 279 students, most of whom are left-behind children. Each student has a sad story and many of whom even can't remember the appearance of their parents.'

Mr Xiong gets up every day at 5.30am. Before doing anything else, he checks to make sure there is hot and cold water for his young charges.

At 6am, he rings the first bell, breaking the quiet on the campus. The lights in the dorms light up one by one. Pupils dress and line up before water taps, waiting for the morning wash to start the day.

At 6:40am, all pupils go into classrooms. But not Mr Xiong. He instead walks through each dormitory.

He needs to know if any student was too sick to get up, or whether there's students missing from the dorms, then he'll contact the children's guardians.

Many parents stay in the city all year round, so Mr Xiong must use the money they send him to look after their children's needs.

At Mr Xiong's office, he has a chart which contains all the contact information of the guardians of the students. 

He also keeps dozens of accounting books, recording clearly the remittance amounts and expenses details.

Each semester Mr Xiong scans the books and emails their contents to each guardian for their records.

Huang Zhengrong's child is a fourth-grader in the school. 

Mr Huang entrusted the guardian rights to Mr Xiong, sending money regularly for him to look after his daughter.

'Headmaster Xiong is a great person. He records each expenses clearly with my daughter's signature. I owe him lots of gratitudes,' he said.

The village has no clinic, so Mr Xiong has also taught himself some basic medical knowledge. 

He administers medicine to sick students and, if they become severely ill, takes them to a clinic dozens of miles away in the neighbouring village.

Mr Xiong said: 'I received tons of discriminations since childhood, but there are more people who are helpful, which pulls me out of self-pity and helps me go through the difficult times.

'I know how important it is having help from others.

'If I don't care about the children, who would do it?'
