As a space enthusiast fascinated by NASA, then 19-year-old Jeffery Ault was looking forward watching the Challenger blast off into space while on a visit to Florida.

On the day of the launch – January 28, 1986 – he brought his Super 8 home video to the Kennedy Space Centre site, less than ten miles from the launch site.

After the event, the film sat in a box of home movies in Mr Ault’s house for the next quarter century. He unearthed it only last week.

In the clip, exclusively obtained by the Huffington Post, excited watchers can be heard buzzing with excitement. It is 
clear spectators did not know the gravity of the situation after the 
Challenger exploded 73 seconds after lift-off.

Disaster striking: Jeffery Ault captured the Challenger explosion on Super 8 film from a lookout at Kennedy Space Centre, about ten miles from Cape Canaveral

Explosions in the sky: The recording picks up comments from those around him - one woman initially said how beautiful it was before realizing the shuttle had blown up

All seven crew on the Challenger died in the tragedy.

‘I was hoping to see an event that I would remember for the rest of my life,’ Mr Ault told the Huffington Post. ‘I did,’ he continued, ‘Just not in the way I would have liked to.’

In an era when camera phones didn’t exist and video was expensive and cumbersome, this Super 8 footage is truly remarkable.

In the film, people can be heard chattering about their excitement before the launch. After the shuttle fires up, people can be heard commenting on how great the launch is.

‘Excellent, oh, wow! That was cool,’ one man can be heard saying.

But when the shuttle exploded 73 seconds into the flight, those on the ground were unaware ‘Oh, that’s beautiful,’ one woman says..

Seconds later, former NASA public affairs officer Steve Nesbitt can be heard announcing from Mission Control: ‘Listen very carefully to the situation. Obviously, a major malfunction.’

Super 8 mm film was and is a popular way of capturing moving pictures.

Originally released by Kodak in 1965, it was marketed as an improvement to regular 8 mm film and did not originally include audio.

Though it waned in popularity after video was introduced, the medium is still used by some film makers and documentarians to achieve a grainier, dated look.

Moments later, he says: ‘The vehicle 
has exploded. We are looking at – checking with recovery forces to see 
what can be done at this point.’

The
footage captures shock on the ground. ‘The vehicle has exploded!’ a man
repeats. A woman responds: ‘Oh please, don’t say that!’

Recently,
another home video of the explosion was unearthed. Bob Karman was at 
the Orlando airport returning from a trip to Disney World with his 
family.

Until the discovery of Mr Karman’s tape, it was believed that the only home video of the Challenger disaster in existence belonged to Jack Moss, who made a four-minute clip of the tragedy from his home in Winter Haven.

The Challenger spacecraft plunged into the Atlantic off the Florida coast at 11.38am; parts were eventually discovered at the bottom of the ocean.

The cause of the accident was a faulty seal in one of the shuttle's rockets which compromised the fuel tanks.

The shuttle had no escape system for the astronauts but it became known later that several of those on board could have survived the initial explosion.

Investigations were ultimately inconclusive.

Then president Ronald Regan ordered an investigation into the Challenger catastrophe where poor management and a disregard of safety advice were said to have played a role in the disaster. It resulted in a break of around three years in NASA's shuttle program.

Among the seven on board the Challenger shuttle was Christa McAuliffe, the first member of the Teacher In Space Project, after she beat 11,000 candidates to the coveted role.

The unique trip, where she planned to teach American students from space, gained the program much publicity particularly because Mrs McAuliffe had an immediate rapport with the U.S. media and public. 

Part of the excitement over the 'citizen astronaut' was the reason why so many people watched the Challenger disaster first-hand including many schoolchildren.

Other media: Many people were watching the launch on live television when it happened; there was no such thing as YouTube or camera phones
