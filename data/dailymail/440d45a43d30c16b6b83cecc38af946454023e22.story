An engaged father-of-one was shot dead this weekend, after getting into a fight with an acquaintance at a concert where he was performing with his hardcore punk band.

Brad Hancock's band Close Grip was playing a warm-up set at Salt Lake City, Utah venue At The Core Saturday night, when he tried to kick 20-year-old Quincy Earl Lawson out of the concert.  

Friends of the 24-year-old frontman say Hancock was trying to defend his brother who had gotten in an argument with Lawson, and that when the dispute moved to the parking lot, Lawson fired shots at Hancock and another band member. 

Hancock died shortly after. The other man was treated at the scene for a bullet wound to the foot.

Lawson was later arrested by the Salt Lake City police who pulled him over in nearby Nephi.

Police say Hancock and Lawson 'kind of knew each other', but do not appear to have been close friends.

Hancock's fianceé Mariah Borg, mother of their 1-year-old son Sonny, told the Deseret News that Lawson was known for getting in trouble, but that she didn't know he was capable of killing anyone.

She says her boyfriend left for the concert at 5pm on Saturday, and that she received a phone call just a few hours later from a relative saying he had died. 

The couple of three years were scheduled to move into a new house next week and planned to get married next year. She says he was looking forward to teaching their son how to play guitar and skateboard.

Plans ruined: The couple were scheduled to move into a new home next week and were planning on getting married next year, after three years together 

'I just still don't really know how to process it. I just woke up this morning and looked at the baby and started bawling because he wasn't there. It sucks so bad,' a tearful Borg said. 'He took everything from me. The love of my life. The person I should have grown old with. The father of my son....We had so many plans.'

Lawson has a minor criminal record according to public records, including arrests for disorderly conduct, shoplifting, and public intoxication. 

On his Facebook page, where he goes by the name Quincy Dre, he is seen in several pictures wearing the color red and holding up gang hand signs. However, police do not believe the shooting was gang-related. 

Following Hancock's death, friends set up a Go Fund Me account to raise money for his fiancée and son. That fund raised over $10,000 in just a 24 hour period.
