British diving star Tom Daley and his partner James Denny came agonisingly close to winning a gold for England at the Commonwealth Games today after a near-perfect final dive which left them settling for silver.

As there were only four teams competing, there were only two medals awarded, and the pair looked like they were out of contention as they approached the edge of the board for their sixth and final dive.

But the 20-year-old partners, who had just seven days to train together after deciding to enter the event last week, delivered a stunning routine, completing a complex four-and-a-half somersault.

Unfortunately it was not enough to beat an Australian duo led by Matthew Mitcham, who narrowly beat the English pair by just 0.18 in the nail-biting final round.

The English pair beat teams from Canada and Malaysia, who came third but lost out on a podium place because there was no bronze medal

The English pair scored 95.46 in their sixth dive, to score a total of 399.36. Australia's Matthew Mitcham and Domonic Bedggood held their nerve to win by 0.18 with a total of 399.54. Malaysia's Ooi Tze Liang and Chew Yiwei were third but missed out on a podium place.

The competition was taking place in front of Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond, with Daley using a Union Flag chamois to towel himself down between dives.

Earlier today, Daley looked 
relaxed and focused as he warmed-up for the event, where he had hoped to defend the gold medal that he won with partner Max Brick at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

 

He will next compete in the individual men's 10m springboard diving event on Saturday, another event that he took home the gold for in 2010.

Daley's Commonwealth Games debut comes after England dazzled in the diving pool today, with Jack Laugher completing his campaign at the Games with a second gold medal.

The 19-year-old from Harrogate won the men's synchronised three-metre springboard for England alongside best friend and diving partner Chris Mears.

Laugher was the one-metre springboard 
individual champion on Wednesday and silver medallist in the three-metre
 individual event on Thursday.

'It was amazing,' Laugher said. 'The Commonwealth Games have been an absolute dream for me. I was hoping, if I could get lucky, to come away with three medals.

'To come away with two golds and a silver is absolutely fantastic. To do the last one with my best mate and to get that alongside each other is what we've been dreaming of all year.'

Australia's Matthew Mitcham and Grant Nel took silver in the three-metre men's synchronised event, and a second English pair reached the podium as Nick Robinson-Baker and Freddie Woodward claimed bronze.

England's Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree - the pair who combined for synchronised three-metres platform gold on Wednesday - advanced along with Hannah Starling and Scotland's Grace Reid to the final of the women's one-metre springboard.

But the women were beaten to podium places by Jennifer Abel from Canada and Australians Maddison Keeney and Esther Qin.

Their losses came as Scottish athletes Alex Marshall and Paul Foster made it a golden double on the bowls rink as they helped their team thrash England in the men's fours final. The pairs champions teamed up with David Peacock and Neil Speirs to achieve a 16-8 victory.

It was the 
second final defeat of the day for England after Jamie-Lea Winch and 
Natalie Melmore lost 20-17 to South Africa in the women's pairs final, 
with Northern Ireland picking up bronze.

Today
 the home nations continued to prove their gymnastics prowess as 
Scotland's Dan Purvis won the men's parallel bars final at the SSE 
Hydro, fending off England's triple-gold medallist Max Whitlock.

The 23-year-old Scot produced a stunning routine which scored 15.533 to take the title ahead of England's Nile Wilson who won silver with 15.433, while floor, all-around and team champion Whitlock had to settle for bronze with 15.066.

Purvis, who
 had already won team silver and rings bronze, reached the top step of 
the podium after being the last gymnast to perform on the apparatus.

High
 drama on the Glasgow Green hockey pitch saw England pip New Zealand on 
penalties to reach Saturday's women's final, after a 1-1 draw.

 Glynn netted a late equaliser for the Black Sticks after Lily Owsley 
had given England a first-half lead, and goalkeeper Maddie Hinch earned a
 3-1 shoot-out success by proving a fearsome presence.

Scotland finished sixth in women's hockey after losing 2-1 to India in their classification match, as Nikki Kidd's second-half strike was sandwiched by goals two minutes either side from Anupa Barla and Poonam Rani.

In netball, Northern Ireland secured seventh place as they trounced Wales 58-36 behind 46 goals and a sharp-shooting 87 per cent strike rate from Lisa Somerville.England are certain to top a table tennis podium on Saturday after the husband-and-wife team of Paul and Joanna Drinkhall set up a shot at Liam Pitchford and Tin Tin Ho in the mixed doubles final.

Both winning sides went the distance in five-game contests, as the Drinkhalls beat fellow England players Kelly Sibley and Dan Reed 11-5 8-11 5-11 11-8 11-8, while Pitchford and Ho overcame Singaporeans Jian Zhan and Tianwei Feng 12-10 11-8 11-13 6-11 11-15.

Paul Drinkhall said of the all-English final: 'It's a good situation to be in, of course it's difficult as well and we feel sorry for Kelly and Dan right now but we are looking forward to the gold medal match.'
