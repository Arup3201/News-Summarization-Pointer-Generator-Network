Liverpool are showing an interest in Sampdoria's Argentina goalkeeper Sergio Romero who could leave on loan.

Romero was Argentina's hero in the penalty shoot-out with Holland at the World Cup. 

The 27-year-old was named on the three-man shortlist for FIFA's Golden Glove award for the tournament's best goalkeeper as a result, losing out to Germany's Manuel Neuer.

Euphoria: Romero was Argentina's hero in a penalty shoot-out with Holland as they reached the World Cup final

He had a spell on loan at Monaco last season but they have not taken up an option to make the deal permanent. 

Liverpool are in need of a goalkeeper to challenge Simon Mignolet for the No 1 spot after Pepe Reina left the club to join Bayern Munich for £2million last week.

And they believe Romero, who has 54 caps for his country, is the right man to fill the void this summer, as Brendan Rodgers' side look to build on the steady progression they made last season.
