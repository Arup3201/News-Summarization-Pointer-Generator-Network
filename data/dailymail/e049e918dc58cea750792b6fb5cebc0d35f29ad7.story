Criticised: Tony Blair, the former prime minister, at the Northern Ireland Select Committee, where he was accused of 'betraying' terrorism victims

Tony Blair was heavily criticised yesterday for ‘betraying’ terrorism victims after defending his secret deal to send letters granting amnesty to IRA fugitives.

The former Prime Minister insisted the Northern Ireland peace process would probably have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects – the so-called ‘on the runs’.

The scheme, set up by the Labour government in 1999, assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police. Some 95 recipients of the so-called ‘comfort letters’ were linked to almost 300 murders.

Under hostile questioning from the Commons Northern Ireland affairs committee, Mr Blair refused to apologise for setting up a process which victims said effectively handed the recipients ‘get out of jail free’ cards.

But he did say sorry to the victims of the 1982 Hyde Park bombing, which killed four soldiers, because chief suspect John Downey was mistakenly given a ‘comfort letter’ in 2007 which led to the collapse of his Old Bailey murder trial in February last year.

Last night, those who lost loved ones in IRA atrocities said they were ‘disgusted’ with Mr Blair.

Shelley Gilfillan, from Castlederg, County Tyrone, whose uncle Lexie Cummings, 39, was gunned down in cold blood outside his shop by masked republican terrorists, said: ‘Blair won’t talk to the victims but he’ll happily sit down with Sinn Fein and the IRA and do deals. It’s more backstabbing.

‘We are the ones still grieving and they get a pat on the back.’

Mr Blair, who is the UN’s Middle East peace envoy, gave evidence to MPs about the ‘on the runs’ programme after evading an appearance for more than nine months. 

During a heated two-hour session, Mr Blair was told the ‘unsavoury’ scheme, drawn up following pressure from Sinn Fein leaders Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, had left victims feeling ‘hurt and betrayed’.

But the former PM said the letters were ‘absolutely critical’ to the peace process and an ‘essential component’ in getting Sinn Fein to accept an overhauled police service in Northern Ireland.

He said talks were on a ‘knife-edge’ before the establishment of a power-sharing government in Stormont between the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein. ‘If I had been saying we are not dealing with this in any way at all… I think it is likely that the peace process would have collapsed,’ he said.

‘I wanted to put the death, destruction, terrorism and misery to an end. I couldn’t bring back those people who had died during the Troubles but I was trying to make sure there would not be further victims.’

As part of the peace deal, IRA terrorists serving prison terms were granted early release that could not apply to those on the run. But a controversial agreement was reached between Mr Blair and Sinn Fein whereby checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted by police would be sent a letter informing them of that fact.

Mr Blair insisted the scheme was ‘not secret’, even though leading Northern Ireland politicians, including Lord Trimble, who was First Minister of Northern Ireland from 1998 to 2002, and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it.

The comfort letters came to light only when Downey’s trial was halted. Mr Blair said yesterday: ‘For that, I take responsibility and I apologise to those who have suffered.’

But he added: ‘I’m not going to apologise for sending those letters to those who should have received them because without them we would not have had peace.’
