Online sellers are marketing positive pregnancy tests, ultrasounds and even prosthetic bellies as ‘pranks'.

'Joke' pregnancy tests showing two lines or a plus indicating 'pregnant' are being listed on auction sites like eBay for as little as £5, while an entire website has popped up dedicated to faking pregnancy - from conception to birth.

The so-called 'adult novelty prank' could have some alarming and distressing consequences

Online retailer Fake A Baby - who ship worldwide - feature an array of antenatal falsities including positive pregnancy test, fake DNA tests, fake pregnancy prescription pills and fake pregnant stomachs in various sizes.

The site claims to provide 'The best gag gifts on Earth', including a fake 'Proof of Pregnancy' document designed to look just like the real thing from a certified doctor for just £15.

While the nature of the products is astounding, the retailer make sure customers check a box to say they will 'Not to Use This Product for Illegal and or Fraudulent Purposes', before they can check out an item.

If users follow the asterisk down to the bottom of the page, they are faced with a large dislaimer, stating: 'This item has the potential to be used irresponsibly.

The website say all their products are fakes, and they do not trade in any 'genuine' goods

'By completing and submitting the form below, you agree not to use this product for purposes which may be illegal, immoral, fraudulent or hurtful to others. Like almost any item in existence, this product may be used for fun or for evil, depending solely on the intentions of the user. It is designed as a novelty/gag device.

'Be sure your mark has a sense of humor before unleashing this product upon them! We again urge CAUTION when using gags which have the potential of causing emotional harm (as almost any gag or practical joke does).

'KNOW YOUR VICTIM. Many people will not find this issue humorous in the slightest. Be sure your mark has an evolved sense of humor.'

You can choose a hospital name, doctor's name and father's name when ordering a fake scan

The site then go on to declare all their products are fakes, and they do not trade in any 'genuine' goods. All products are stamped FOR ENTERTAINMENT ONLY.

Meanwhile, one eBay listing for a 'prank' positive pregnancy test reads: ‘Have fun 
pranking friends and family with this positive test :)’ while another is
 more catious, stating: ‘These are meant for adult humour only and not 
to be used to cause distress or tension.’

While some inflammatory listings have been taken down, others remain on the site.
