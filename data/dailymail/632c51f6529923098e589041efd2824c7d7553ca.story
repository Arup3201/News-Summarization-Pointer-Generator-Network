A Carlton Blues player has been kicked off the team for inappropriate conduct on social media.

It was ruled that Josh Bootsma breached the AFL's code of conduct, by reportedly posting explicit images on photo-sharing app Snap Chat.

The club was notified of the misconduct on Monday, apparently by the mother of a teenage girl who was believed to be exchanging images with the player.

Bootsma's girlfriend Kyla Maree Addis is heavily pregnant, with the couple's baby due any day now, according to The Age.

It was announced on Tuesday that the Carlton player would not continue his contract with the club.

This is not the first time Bootsma has been in breach of the code, and when Carlton football manager Andrew McKay addressed the media on Tuesday he said Bootsma had been known to arrive late to training and skip appointments.

'That was the final straw that broke the camels back for us to decide to terminate his contract,' Mr McKay said.

When asked about the nature of the inappropriate content, Mr McKay said he didn't believe it was necessary to go into the details.

'The point is he's put something on social media that's highly inappropriate, and it really does not meet the standards of the football club.'

The football manager also said that the club had tried to help Bootsma by offering him support and welfare but he had continued to let the side down.

'The Carlton Football Club has high expectations of its players and staff; we expect them to uphold certain standards,' he said.

In a statement Carlton said the defender had been offered counseling and welfare but had not met the club's behaviour standards, according to the Herald Sun.

Bootsma had a contract with the club until the end of 2015, and is currently coming to an agreement with Carlton in regards to it, with The Age reporting that he will not be paid out.

He hasn't taken to the field for the club this year, and his last game was played in round 21 of 2013.
