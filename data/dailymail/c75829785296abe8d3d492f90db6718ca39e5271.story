Two 16-year-old girls have been charged with murder for their roles in a North Carolina taxi driver's slaying.

Consandra Nicole Tyree and Emily Katherine Starnes are accused of being involved in the brutal stabbing death of Yellow Cab Company driver Adam Williams in a Hickory parking lot in August.

The girls join three men between 18- and 22 years old charged in the death of the 32-year-old.

The Hickory Daily Record reports Emily
Starnes of Hickory and Consandra Tyree of Newton were arrested on 
Saturday and charged with murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon and 
conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon five months after 
an initial arrest in relation with the case. They are being held in the 
Catawba County jail.

Williams was murdered shortly after he arrived to pick up passengers at a Hickory restaurant on August 23 at around 10.30pm.

He had driven for Yellow Cab Company for just two months.

Brutal: Adam Williams had only worked for the Yellow Cab Company for two weeks when he was slain on Tuesday night in August. He was carrying just $39 in fares

He had been on his shift for less than
five hours and was carrying just $39 in fares when his attackers 
pounced and he was stabbed after arriving at the parking lot of 
Fuddruckers hamburger restaurant.

Despite his injuries, Williams 
mananged to struggle down the street to the doorway of the Longhorn 
Steakhouse, bleeding from slashes to his face and throat.

Employees called an ambulance and he was taken to Frye Regional Medical Centre where he was pronounced dead.

In October the teens, who were both 
students at the time, were charged with obstruction of justice after 
investigators said the girls were not honest during questioning, 
according to Captain Thurman Whisnant of the Hickory Police Department.

'They were the two girls that were with the suspects on the night on the cab driver’s murder,' Whisnant said.

'They were heavily involved; they were involved before, during and after the murder.'

He added that the girls will be treated as adults when they appear in court on May 14.

Tyree's stepmother, Kelly Tyree, declined comment on Sunday. A message left at Starnes' home was not returned.  

Five people have now been arrested in relation to the killing.

Camyron Johnson, 22, and Robert 
McElwee, 18, both of Hickory, and Matthew Hopkins, 22, of Connelly 
Springs, were arrested three days after Williams was killed.

Johnson and Hopkins were charged with murder. McElwee was charged with accessory after the fact.

Starnes and Tyree are scheduled to appear in court on May 14.
