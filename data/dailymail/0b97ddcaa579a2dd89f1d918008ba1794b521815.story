Thousands of cushions handmade as gifts for Olympics athletes may go to waste after London 2012 organisers told volunteers they can’t hand them out.

The London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) initially told volunteers from the Woolsack project that they could present the 5,000 cushions they had created as souvenirs for the stars.

But now, in apparent fear of angering commercial sponsors, they have reneged on the deal.

Support: Team GB's heptathlete Jessica Ennis has championed the cushions, but will not be able to receive one due to red tape

Dedicated families and elderly and disabled members of the scheme have worked since early last year to create the individually crafted presents.

But plans for a stand in the Olympic  Village to distribute the cushions  were quashed because the space was needed for sponsors.

They were then told in February there would be no direct access to give athletes the items or delegates of National Olympic Committees who had also voiced an interest in receiving a gift.

Project leader Jane Cooper, 53, said many people would be left outraged if their creations never reached the athletes they were designed for.

She said: 'It shouldn’t have been reduced to this. It means so much to the people who make the cushions.

Families, elderly and disabled members of the Woolsack volunteer scheme have spent months making the Olympic-themed cushions for athletes

'The elderly, disabled 
and people in care homes are among them. They feel this is their link 
with the Olympics even if some are not able to get to London themselves.

'A
mum with three children in Wales said there was no way she could afford
to take her family to the games but that creating a cushion each would 
be their contribution.

'Changes to distribution plans that 
have been imposed on us by LOCOG are very frustrating, and have caused 
us great difficulties in our planning.

'The
decisions that have been made haven’t made sense at all and I’m still 
perplexed about the needs of commercial sponsors being repeatedly 
raised.'

Lisa Dobriskey, left, 1,500m athlete said she thought the cushions were 'really
original' and compared far more favourably to the Beijing Olympics' 
keyring, and Marilyn Okoro, right, 800m and 400m relay also supports them

Grateful: Katie Summerhayes (freestyle skiing), Scott Dixon, right, (cross country skiing) and Calum Irvine, left (biathlon) are lucky ones to already have received their cushions

She continued: 
'I’m saddened that so much that is great, exciting and wonderful about 
the 2012 Games has been reduced to a stream of increasingly restrictive 
emails.'

The bouncy 
cushions were initially coined as perfect gifts as they would not take 
up considerable room in athletes’ cases packing after the games and 
weigh just 300 grams.

It was hoped the personal gift would be given to as many Olympic and Paralympic athletes as possible.

But after losing the stand in June 
last year, when 4,000 had already been made, the group feel efforts to 
distribute them were discarded completely.

Martyn Rooney, left, 400m rowing and Tom Parsons, right, high jump, were also fans of the unique gifts

The project was then presented to 
AthCom, the Cultural Olympiad Board which represents athletes at the 
games, spearheaded by former British Olympian triple jumper Jonathan 
Edwards.

He presented 
Woolsack to the delegates of all the National Olympic Committees and 
National Paralympic Committees of which a third were very interested or 
wanted their athletes to have cushions.

Plans to distribute them were then scrapped in October and to the athletes completely in February this year.

Jane
said: 'I don’t exactly know why the Woolsack project has been placed in
such a difficult situation. The means to deliver the gifts steadily 
eroded

Dedication: Volunteer Janet Ellison from Kempston, Bedford helped hand make thousands of cushions as gifts for Olympics athletes

'Over the winter we focused on trying to use the regional training camps as the most appropriate way to get cushions to the athletes who wanted one.

'Despite the efforts our co-ordinator was making, the rules about giving gifts to athletes became more and more restrictive.

'It
took until January for LOCOG to confirm that there would then be no 
arrangements for access or contact to distribute the cushions to 
athletes.

'It has been frustrating to have one after another agreed plan brought to an end by or through LOCOG.

'We know how much the athletes love the cushions and want to have them, we will persevere and find ways meet their requests.'

The London Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (LOCOG) has now said the space to hand out the cushions in the Olympic park has been allocated to commercial sponsors

LOCOG officially cited logistical reasons for deciding to not to continue with the project.

A London 2012 spokesperson said: 'The Inspire mark was granted to over 2,700 projects across the UK to enable the projects an official association with the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.

'This gives those projects the opportunity to profile themselves as part of the Games.

'In this case the London 2012 Athletes Committee was presented with a number of options of gifts that can be officially distributed to athletes at the Games and decided not to proceed with offering the cushions to all athletes for a number of logistical reasons.

'We think the Woolsack cushions are great and are happy that they are available to athletes from around the world on request.'
