The two clubs are competing in the Schalke 04 Cup this weekend in Gelsenkirchen.

A spokesman for the Polizeipräsidium Düsseldorf said: ‘There were 300 English fans in the city centre.

'The fans from both clubs met and first of all they had some beers on their own, and when they met the other club there has been some verbal arguments. After that they had a psychical fight.'

‘We put 100 policemen in the city centre so that things would calm down and it calmed down very fast but we made 21 short term arrests.’
