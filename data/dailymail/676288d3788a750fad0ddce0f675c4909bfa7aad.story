A landlord has been caught selling dangerous 'screen-wash' spirits in fake Kommissar vodka bottles.

Police found the knock-off bottles contained three toxic ingredients- any one of which would have forced the drinker to have to seek immediate medical attention.

Sukhdev Singh Gill, who held licences for the Coach and Horses and Chaplains pubs in County Durham, has now handed over his drinks licence ahead of a criminal investigation.

Durham County Council's licensing committee heard the spirit contained potentially lethal iso-propanol, methanol and t-butanol. It also had an alcohol content of just 29 per cent - where vodka is expected to be around 40 per cent.

Sergeant Tim Robson, of Durham Police, confirmed that officers and Trading Standards will carry out a full criminal investigation into the sale of the fake vodka which he described as 'screen wash' in his initial report.

'These are criminal offences. It is an indictable offence to sell any product that tells a lie about itself,' he said.

'An interview will take place after this hearing, he has been away in India.'

Methanol

Highly toxic and potentially lethal, methanol ingestion can cause blindness and death.

Only a small amount is sufficient to produce acute damage to the central nervous system leading to permanent neurological dysfunction and irreversible blindness.

Iso-propanol

Used in the manufacturing of resins, inks and acetone, iso-propanol can cause serious medical complications.

When ingested, it can cause bradycardia- slowing of the heartbeat. In severe cases, this can lead to heart failure.

It also affects the nervous system causing nausea and dizziness and if absorbed through the skin, can lead to extreme difficulties in breathing and eventual coma or death.

T-butanol

Used a pesticide, t-butanol is a carcinogen and highly toxic. If ingested it can also cause neurological damage.

He added that the style of label on the bottles had been out of use for around three years while the meeting heard that the labels did not have authenticity stamps.

Councillor Edward Bell, vice-chairman of the licensing committee, said: 'Potentially someone is going to get killed by this gut rot.'

Star Pubs and Bars - the firm that owns the Coach and Horses - is now planning to sell the venue to Amber Taverns who plan on investing up to £500,000 to make the venue into a 'community pub'.

The firm said it will complete the purchase of the pub and, subject to planning, aims to have it revamped, up and running by July.

The meeting heard how Gill, who did not attend the meeting, has no hand in running either premises.

Andrew Cochrane, solicitor from Star Pubs and Bars, the company that owns the building, said: 'Mr Gill was the tenant and DPS (designated premises supervisor).

'Obviously it's immensely regrettable that Mr Gill has chosen to go down that line stocking vodka that was substandard and dangerous.

'I am aware as part of the investigations carried out that Mr Gill fell on his sword.'

The application to revoke the licence for Chaplains was adjourned.
