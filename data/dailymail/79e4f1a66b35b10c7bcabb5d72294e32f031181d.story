Sportsmail's takes a look at the Premier League's forgotten men, who have yet to or hardly feature for their respective top-flight clubs so far this season.

Andrew Magee highlights the top five from this campaign...

SCOTT SINCLAIR (Manchester City)

2014-15 PL appearances: 1

Approx wage: £45,000 a week

Sinclair played in the Community Shield and City’s 7-0 win over Sheffield Wednesday in the Capital One Cup, but as a late sub, as he was against Crystal Palace last Saturday. 

Since joining City in 2012, the winger has played just 18 times. Even on loan at West Brom last season he only featured in 11 games.

RIO FERDINAND (QPR)

2014-15 PL apps: 7

Approx wage: £40,000

Ferdinand was reunited with his old boss Harry Redknapp over the summer, but the honeymoon period did not last long.

He started at the centre of the QPR defence, but after several mistakes was left out. His last appearance came in a 2-0 defeat at West Ham in October and he has had to settle for a place on the bench since.

MATIJA NASTASIC (Manchester City)

2014-15 PL apps: 0

Approx wage: £75,000

The Serb was a useful player under Roberto Mancini, but has gone from Vincent Kompany’s potential partner to barely getting a look in under Manuel Pellegrini. 

After being told he could leave in the summer, Nastasic played in the Community Shield, but has not featured since with Pellegrini rarely mentioning his name.

Matija Nastasic has failed to make any kind of impression on City boss Manuel Pellgrini

ANDERSON (Manchester United)

2014-15 PL apps: 1

Approx wage: £60,000

Anderson has never lived up to his billing at United and it seems Louis van Gaal feels the same way about him as David Moyes. 

Moyes sent him on loan to Fiorentina last season and since returning the Brazilian has played just twice — the 4-0 loss to MK Dons in the Capital One Cup and a 0-0 draw at Burnley.

Anderson has been deemed surplus to requirements at Manchester United

SHAUN WRIGHT-PHILLIPS (QPR)

2014-15 PL apps: 0

Approx wage: £70,000

The diminutive midfielder has yet to make a Premier League appearance for QPR this season. Wright-Phillips has made the bench four times but has largely been left out of Harry Redknapp’s match-day squads.

His only game time came in QPR’s 1-0 Capital One Cup defeat to Burton in August.
