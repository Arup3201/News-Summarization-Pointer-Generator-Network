Kurt Zouma has praised Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho's role in his rapid development that has seen the Frenchman become a contender at centre back for both his club and country.

The 20-year-old defender has made 20 appearances in his first season at Stamford Bridge, and Mourinho's guidance has seen him keep established starter Gary Cahill out of the side at times.

Zouma's form earned a France call-up for the current international break, and he could even earn his first cap in their friendly against Denmark on Sunday night.

Zouma said that Mourinho puts a lot of pressure on his players, but he seems to be thriving under it

And Chelsea's breakthrough star credits his impressive showings that have led him to this point in his career to the manager who signed him for £12million from St Etienne last January.

When asked what he had learnt under Mourinho, Zouma said: 'To hate defeat. When you lose it's out of bounds to continue as normal in the evening. When you play for Chelsea you must not accept losing.

'Mourinho puts pressure on all his players. He is very demanding and wants perfection.

'In defence, he asks me to move tactically and to be well placed to listen to John (Terry) and Gary Cahill around me. Initially, I was obsessed with the ball and did not watch players behind me enough, but it's something I've been working on.'

Zouma played in midfield for Chelsea against Tottenham Hotspur in the Capital One Cup final and was then deployed there again by Mourinho against West Ham United and Paris Saint-Germain. While Zouma was surprised to play there, he did so under specific instructions.

'In midfield, it's different,' he said. 'He (Mourinho) asks me to use my power and to stay in place to help the defence.' 

Although the young defender has found a place in Didier Deschamps' squad for the current set of fixtures, he does not yet see himself as a potential contender for Euro 2016, which the French are set to host.

'Honestly, I think I have to play a little more to be worthy of a place,' he said in an interview with L'Equipe.

'I'll work hard. They (the other centre backs) are really strong and they have the experience. But when you have a goal, you should not look at who is in front of you, you should fight. That is all.'
