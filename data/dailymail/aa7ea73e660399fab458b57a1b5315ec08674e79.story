A Nevada man says he shot and killed Bigfoot in San Antonio, Texas, causing fury among Bigfoot fans who say it’s all a hoax.

Rick Dyer, who runs a website called BigfootTracker.com and makes a living tracking the mythical creature, claims he is ‘going to go down in history as the best Bigfoot tracker in the world.’

However, he has not yet revealed the ape-man’s body to the public due to a contractual agreement with a documentary crew which allows them to release their film first, he says.

Bigfoot hunter: Rick Dyers of Las Vegas, Nevada, says he shot and killed Bigfoot in San Antonio, Texas

‘Bigfoot is 100 per cent real. There's no question about that,’ Dyer told KSAT.com during a recent Skype interview from his home in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Dyer said the body is being kept in a warehouse in an undisclosed location in Nevada and told the news outlet that he has one eye-witness.

Musky Allen, possibly a fake name, told KSAT that he was invited to view Bigfoot’s corpse.

‘What I saw was a sasquatch, and there's no question in my mind it was at one point a living creature,’ Allen said.

‘(The feet) were extremely wide from the center up to the toes and it had completely hair-covered feet. So much so, it was extremely hard to find the toes. I had to actually pull back some hair to see the toes.’

Eye-witness? 'It scared the hell outta me,' said one campsite resident who claims he saw Bigfoot before the ape-man was allegedly killed

Dyer claims he lured Bigfoot into a homeless campsite in the woods near Loop 1604 and Highway 151 in San Antonio and shot him.

The first time he came to the site was in 2009, he says, after a homeless woman called 911 to report a Bigfoot sighting.

The woman and her husband were living in a tent in the area when they allegedly reported seeing a ‘very large, hairy animal’ enter their campsite and take off with a deer carcass.

‘This thing was 75 feet away from me,’ the unidentified woman told a 911 dispatcher. ‘It smells awful and devoured a whole deer carcass and then took off and screamed, screeched, and took off across the street. I know you guys are going to think I'm crazy but I'm dead serious.’

Dyer says he saw Bigfoot behind a Home Depot when he came to the site in 2009, but was unable to catch him.

This time around he says he nailed pork ribs to the side of the tree.

‘Low and behold, he came and started eating the pork ribs off the tree,’ Dyer said.

‘I have been all over the world searching for Bigfoot. I have moved my family to seven different states. I am dedicated,’ he added.

Skeptics are calling Dyer’s allegations a hoax, similar to previous Bigfoot-related claims he was unable to back up in 2008.

Dyer and friends said they had the creature’s body at the time and even held a news conference to make the announcement.

But the body was never revealed.

'Everyone should know by now that Dyer's latest "Bigfoot in a freezer" Part 2 stunt is another hoax,' Bigfoot Evidence, the 'World's Only 24/7 Bigfoot News Blog,' recently posted.

Dyer says he will be vindicated this time around when the upcoming documentary film is released later this year.

‘Once this film comes out in late March or early April, then we're going to start releasing photos and then eventually the body,’ he said.

‘(Investors) have paid for all the necessary testing to prove that this is an unknown creature and not a man in a suit or a caveman or something. This is a Bigfoot.’
