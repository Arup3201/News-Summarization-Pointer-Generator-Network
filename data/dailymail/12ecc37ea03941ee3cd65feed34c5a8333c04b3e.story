A Chicago Cubs baseball player has been questioned over a nightclub shooting in which four people were injured.

Starlin Castro, a shortstop for the team, was spoken to by officers in Monte Cristi, the Dominican Republic, over an alleged argument between Castro's younger brother and a government official.

The shooting, which took place in the sportsman's home town, is the second in the town to which he has been linked this month.

Arrested? Local law enforcement said Cubs player Starlin Castro was arrested and had his house raided after a shooting - but his agent denied either thing happened

'Not even close': According to Castro's agent, the player had nothing to do with the incident and only went to police to explain as much

The player was one of six people detained by police, and his home in the town was also searched, according to a law enforcement spokesman. He said Castro has now been released.

However, the player's agent said that he went to police of his only accord - with the sole intention of telling them he had nothing to do with it. He has denied he was arrested.

Agent Paul Kinzer said: 'They said they had video and they knew he wasn't involved'.

He told the Chicago Tribune: 'He said he wasn’t even close to [the shooting]. He doesn’t even know what happened.

'He just heard there was a fight and just left through the back door to go to his car and then he went to the police to make sure they knew he wasn’t involved.'

The shooting occurred in the northwest province of Montecristi, where the 24-year-old Castro is from. Police said at least four people were treated at a hospital for injuries.

According to local reports, one man is in serious condition after being hit in the abdomen.

Police are investigating allegations that the shooting occurred after an argument between Castro's brother and the assistant of a government official.

Castro's name was linked to a separate shooting in a different nightclub in early December - but the player appeared at a new conference to say he had already left a club when a the shots were fired.

'It's just they keep dragging his name into this and he had nothing to do with either incident,' Kinzer said.

Kinzer said Castro had spoken with the Cubs and 'they aren't happy his name is involved' again. The 24-year-old Castro hit .292 with 14 homers and 65 RBIs in 134 games last season.
