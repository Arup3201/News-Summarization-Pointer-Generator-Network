London Fashion Week, which wound to a close yesterday, came and went quicker than you can say Alexa Chung.

While many people dismiss the five-day style event in the capital as nothing more than ridiculous, a lot of what the designers showcased on the runway will actually be filling our wardrobes in months to come.

From the more wearable trends - such as Burberry and Matthew Williamson's boho vibes - to the downright bizarre looks - like Sophia Webster's full glitter faces and Giles's Victorian doll inspired looks - FEMAIL has compiled the most weird and wonderful trends to emerge from London fashion week. 

BOHO VIBES 

The most accessible trend to come out of fashion week was the Sevenites revival. Bohemian vibes were most prominent at Burberry, with a show called Patchwork, Pattern & Prints.

Burberry's new arm candy, the bucket bag, was given a fringed makeover, as were the brand's winter ponytail booties.

The fashion brand's staple trench succumbed to the new trend too, emerging with paisley prints in blossom hues. 

Teal and olive maxi dresses also made a comeback and were worn with the tiniest of waistcoats.

Mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings rocked the runway, with the occasional injection of leopard-print making a graphic statement. 

Similarly, Matthew Williamson stuck to his signature boho style by unveiling a mystical and bright hued collection  inspired by the signs of the Zodiac.

Flowing silk dresses came slashed to the hip and were often embellished with bold blue crystals inspired by birth flowers, horoscope signs and stones.

Fur is officially in fashion come autumn, if Matthew's catwalk is anything to go by - his shaggy Mongolian lamb and shearling in topaz, teal, and pink sent Instagram into a furry frenzy. 

Boho is back, according to Burberry, where Christopher Bailey sent models down the runway in mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings

VICTORIANA FASHION

Designers often look to the past for inspiration but it seems that this season, many delved deep into their archives by taking the Victorian age as their point of reference.

Design duo Amy Molyneaux and Percy Parker exhibited an affinity towards the dark side at their AW15 show on Friday night.

The relentlessly alluring theme of Gothic romanticism seeped throughout the collection - named Persephone - thanks to delicate fabrics and feminine details nostalgic of the Victorian age. 

Frills were rife, dominating the collars or lining the dress, and even made their mark on footwear.

Silk blouses and sheer fabrics flowed down the runway, followed by luxurious felt wool coats that embraced winter’s charm and highlighted the feminine silhouette.

There were similar scenes at Giles, with models sent down the runway with black lips, pale complexions and ruffled collars with silk bows galore.

BONDAGE

Julien Macdonald is unapologetic about his love for high octane glamour, but his AW15 collection was a departure from the usual feast of glitter and sequins that he has made his signature.

The Welsh designer and Strictly Come Dancing star embraced gothic glamour in his London show.

Julien's racy designs were overtly sexual but managed to maintain that sense of sophistication that makes him a red carpet favourite.

Dominatrix-esque models took to the runway wearing thick chokers, long black gloves and embellished luxe silks.

Dresses, both long and short, came with peek-a-boo cutouts and were worn with thigh-high leggings, ensuring the Julien woman garners attention for all the right reasons. 

Marko Mitanovski, a firm favourite of Lady Gaga, also embraced the bondage theme by sending models down the runway wearing full fishnet bodysuits  with just a thong underneath.

The Serbian designer's catwalk was awash with masks, collars and corsets in leather and croc, with some faces completely covered in black paint.

Meanwhile, Sophia Webster  the queen of quirky footwear - incorporated the bondage theme into her show designs with thigh-high strappy sandals with leather detailing, as well as bags emblazoned with the words 'Freak Like Me'.

ACCESSORISE ALL AREAS  

Roadwork emblazoned handbags, neon furs and orb headbands are just a few of the ways we will be accessorising come autumn.

Queen of the tote, Anya Hindmarch - who is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite bag designers - performed her usual magic of turning mundane everyday items into desirable accessories that often attract a long waiting list.

For her autumn/winter 2015 line, entitled 'The Diversion Collection'. Anya was influenced by Britain's motorways, with models marching down a catwalk decorated with road markings and overseen by LED speed limits.

Motifs for this season stepped away from the busy sticker theme of her last collection, with bags stamped with traffic signs like 'road works ahead' and 'no U-turn.'

Perhaps one of the most unique items in the collection is the Eddie Stobart clutch that is a miniature replica of the motorway regulars. 

As for headwear, models at Ashley Williams wore the furriest shearling bucket hats, while Gyo Yuni Kimchoe decorated models in space age style helmets with animal horns and tassled ribbon necklaces, and Sophia Webster's headbands came adorned with orbs.

Hats at the Ashley Williams show came in the softest sheepskin and shearling textures (even if the models could barely see beneath them)

Accessories took on a whole new meaning at Gyo Yuni Kimchoe, where male models wore space age style helmets with animal horns and tassled ribbon necklaces  

Sophia Webster's girls wore headbands with giant gold orbs attached to them 

Roksanda Ilincic is the master of colour blocking and her AW15 footwear was no exception 

Acid-coloured chubby furs and bags provided some eye-catching additions to Roksanda's catwalk

BOLD BEAUTY: INTERESTING EYES, GLITTER-FILLED FACES AND POLKA DOT MAKE-UP 

It isn't just the clothes designers who create the new trends at London Fashion Week. 

Behind the scenes, the most talented hair and make-up artists in the world work like a well-oiled machine to set the next season's beauty trends - and if they have anything to do with it, we'll be wearing fake freckles, smudged lipstick or perhaps even no make-up at all come next autumn. 

FEMAIL went backstage to meet the hotbed of talent conjuring up AW15's beauty looks and from what we've witnessed, you'll be getting creative in six months' time (so get your glitter at the ready).

Portuguese designers Marta Marques and Paulo Almeida for Marques' Almeida sent models down their runway with  white eyelashes, while Val Garland decorated models' eyes with sequins.

At Matthew Williamson, Benefit's Lisa Potter-Dixon created a new take on eyeliner being dubbed 'displaced liner,' by applying a sweep on the models' sockets rather than on their waterline.

Sophia Webster, always one to push quirky trends, asked  Sharon Dowsett fom L'Oreal Paris to completely coat some of the models' faces in glitter. 

Elsewhere, other models were given totally white faces with a bold glitter lip.

At Dora Abodi, models faces were painted white all over and tiny polkadots were applied using marker pen
