A widower fulfilled his wife’s dying wish of having a traditional viking funeral - by burning and sinking her ashes on a replica warship.

Devoted Francis Mulcahy, 50, took his wife Karine’s ashes two miles out to sea on a replica Viking longship which he built himself.

He then set fire to the 3ft-long vessel and watched it sink - just like the traditional funeral services conducted by the Vikings hundreds of years ago.

Bookkeeper Karine insisted on the unusual send-off because her grandparents were Scandinavian and she always celebrated her Nordic roots.

Proud Mr Mulcahy, 50, said: 'She would have loved the way we did the funeral for her. We always spoke about what each other would want to do if one of us died.

Tragic: Karine Mulcahy, of Tavistock, Devon, died from a blood clot which spread to her lungs on September 15 last year and her funeral and cremation took place on September 23

'I loved her very much, she wished for that sort of funeral, so that’s what she got. I wanted to give her everything I possibly could in my power.'

Karine, of Tavistock, Devon, died 
from a blood clot which spread to her lungs on September 15 last year 
and her funeral and cremation took place on September 23.

Mr Mulcahy then
set about fulfilling her dying wish and bought a £120 flatpack replica 
Viking longboat - intended as a collector’s model - which was made of 
timber.

He then spent five days building the boat and added a Scottish Saltire flag to reflect Karine’s birthplace.

Her ashes were carefully placed into two small cabins on the boat’s deck.

On April 28 Francis was joined by around 70 mourners who packed onto a friend’s fishing boat and sailed out from Plymouth Sound.

When they were two miles out to sea he used a blowtorch to ignite a number of firelighters on the deck.

He said: 'We put it into the water after sailing out on a friend’s boat and we put fire-lighters on the top of the boat.

'We used a blow torch to set it alight and just watched it as it burnt.

'After
that we turned the boat around and went to a pub where we had a good 
eat and a good drink together and just simply celebrated her life. We 
had a great send off for her.'

Mr Mulcahy chose the specific date to burn the boat as he wanted to do it as close to Karine’s 60th birthday, on May 2, as possible.

Paying tribute to his late wife, he said: 'She was the most beautiful, sweetest person that I have ever met.

'She
was kind, she always thought about others before herself, she was 
absolutely beautiful and will be greatly missed by her family and 
friends.'
