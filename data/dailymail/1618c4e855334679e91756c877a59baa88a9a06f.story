A 15-year-old schoolgirl who has disappeared with her older boyfriend was today at the centre of a police hunt.

Nicola Barr, of Caversham, near Reading, Berkshire, is believed to have run away with 18-year-old Jamie Bloomfield nearly a week ago.

The young couple, who have not been seen since August 21, are believed to be travelling around the country together.

Officers have appealed for the couple or anyone who sees them to contact police.

Nicola Barr, 15, has disappeared and is believed to be with her boyfriend Jamie Bloomfield, 18

Detectives were keen to stress they were not treating this as an abduction or exploitation scenario.

It is thought that the pair could be in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Stoke on Trent in Staffordshire or Rochdale, Greater Manchester, since going missing.

Nicola was last seen at her home at 7am on August 21.

She was reported missing to police when she failed to return home at the agreed time.

Missing: The pair have not been seen for nearly a week and police appealed for help in tracing them. Nicola is from Caversham, near Reading, Berkshire, and Jamie is from Rochdale, Greater Manchester

Nicola is described as white, 5ft 6ins, slim, with red hair and hazel-coloured eyes.

It was previously thought she was wearing a black baseball cap with Heat written on the front, however this has since been found so it is not known what she is wearing.

Police believe that she is with her boyfriend, Jamie Bloomfield, who lives 220 miles away from the teenager in Rochdale.

Detective Constable Paul Jacobs said: 'We are very keen to trace both Nicola and Jamie, who we believe are together and maybe travelling around the country.

'They may have possibly been in Leamington Spa, Stoke on Trent and the Rochdale area since going missing.

'They have now been missing since Wednesday and we need to trace them to check they are okay as soon as possible.

'There is nothing to suggest Nicola has been removed from her home against her will and we are not treating this as an abduction or exploitation scenario.

'I would urge anyone who sees Nicola and Jamie anywhere in the country to contact us as soon as possible.

'I would also like to appeal directly to both Nicola and Jamie. You are not in any trouble, we are trying to trace you to check your welfare, not to take any action against you.

'Please contact the police wherever you are by calling 101 so we can make sure you are both safe.'
