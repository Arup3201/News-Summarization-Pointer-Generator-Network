Barack Obama's top spokesman shied away on Monday from confirming UK Prime Minister David Cameron's revelation that the president calls by a nickname – 'bro.'

But it's the way he dodged a question about presidential nicknames from CBS White House Correspondent Major Garrett that had reporters laughing.

'To paraphrase a local baseball player here in Washington, D.C., that's a clown question, bro,' Earnest said during the first press conference since Obama and his entourage returned from a lengthy Hawaiian vacation.

The reference wasn't lost on a chuckling press corps: Bryce Harper, an outfielder with the Washington Nationals baseball team, created that quip in 2012 to dismiss a post-game question he didn't want to answer.

'CLOWN QUESTION': White House press secretary Josh Earnest dodged a question on Monday about whether Barack Obama has a masculine nickname for David Cameron

THE ORIGINAL: Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper dismissed a question about celebratory beers in 2012 by telling a reporter, 'That’s a clown question, 'bro'

BRO: British PM David Cameron has a 'special' relationship with Obama and has earned a presidential nickname

Harper was just 19 years old then, too young to legally consume a celebratory beer after a game-winning home run in the U.S. – but he was in Toronto at the time.

When a locker-room reporter asked him if he might have that drink in Canada, Harper grimaced and said, 'I'm not gonna answer that question. That's a clown question, 'bro.'

Harper, as the journalist should have known, is also a devout Mormon. 

Washington's bro-mance with the phrase came full circle a week later, when then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, repeated the line in a press conference on Capitol Hill.

He was sidestepping a question about whether he planned to bring the DREAM Act, an Obama-favored piece of immigration legislation, to the Senate floor. 

Reid is known as a devoted baseball fan. Reporters erupted in laughter.

Earnest's crown, however, groaned in recognition of what was likely a carefully planned response. 

This year's news bro-mentum came from an interview with David Cameron conducted by the Mail on Sunday, in which the PM commented on his close relationship with Obama.

'Yes, he sometimes calls me 'Bro,' Cameron confided. 

Earnest insisted Monday that he was joking, and then provided an official response.

'I am not able to give much more insight about the private communications between the president of the United States and the prime minister of the United Kingdom,' he said.  

But, he added, he didn't doubt Cameron's claim that he and Obama were close enough to generate a special nickname.

'I don't, because as you know, they have a special relationship,' Earnest said.

But as the press conference ended and the White House's video feed shut down, Earnest could be heard telling a reporter that he had a backup line in mind if Bryce Harper's words had seemed the wrong way to go.

'It was either that,' he said, 'or "Don't tase me, 'bro".'

That was a reference to a more ancient event, but a political one. 

'DON'T TASE ME, 'BRO': Florida college student Andrew Meyer became an Internet sensation in 2007 when he jumped a Q-and-A line and earned an arrest from campus police

In September 2007 at a University of Florida event, then-Senator John Kerry took questions from an audience of students. 

Andrew Meyer, 21, jumped the queue and resisted campus police wen they puled him away from the microphone.

As he struggled, four officers held him down while another zapped him with a stun gun.

When Meyer saw the weapon, he shouted, 'Don't tase me, 'bro!'

One video of that event, posted on YouTube by the Gainesville Sun newspaper, has been viewed more than 7.3 million times. 

Kerry was heard on the video, helplessly trying to restore order

British leader is so close to the US president that Obama calls him 'bro,' Cameron told the Mail on Sunday.

White House spokesman Josh Earnest won't confirm that account, choosing to dismiss the question with a famous Washington sports quip

'That's a clown question, bro,' he told a CBS reporter, mimicking Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper

Harper, then 20 years old, coined the phrase in 2012 when a reporter asked if he could drink beer in Canada, where the drinking age is under 21

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was the first politician to quote Harper, sidestepping a political question a week later
