Barack Obama says voters in the United States are going to want 'that new car smell' when the 2016 presidential campaign comes along to choose his successor

He is pledging to do everything possible to help that nominee succeed..

Obama's former secretary of state Hillary Clinton is strongly fancied to run on the Democratic ticket for the White House, although she has repeatedly refused to confirm she wants to do so.

'I think the American people, you know, they're gonna want, you know, that new car smell,' Obama said in an interview broadcast Sunday on ABC News.

Ready to leave? 'When you've been president for six years, you know, you've got some dings,' Obama said in an ABC interview 

'You know... they wanna drive somethin' off the lot that... that doesn't have as much mileage as me.'

Obama, whose 40 percent job approval rating was a drag on Democrats in the November 4th midterms elections, said he doubted he will be asked to campaign much for the eventual Democratic nominee in 2016. 

 'You know, they're probably not gonna be looking at me to campaign too much,' Obama said. 'One of the things about our society which is great is that we don't have real long memories. And, you know, we get impatient for the next thing.'

He continued, 'I think at the end of two years if they want me to do some selective thing, I'll be happy to do 'em, but I suspect that folks will be ready to see me go off to the next thing.'

Remember when he had that new car smell? President Obama says he believes that the Democratic party won't want him to campaign for them in the 2016 election

Obama, in the interview conducted in Las Vegas on Friday, described Clinton as a friend and said they speak regularly.

He believes she would be 'a formidable candidate' and 'a great president.'

'And she's not gonna agree with me on everything,' he added. 'One of the benefits of running for president is you can stake out your own positions.' 

You have a clean slate. A fresh start. You know, when you've been president for six years, you've got some dings.'

Obama stopped short of endorsing her campaign, however, and said other Democrats would also be 'terrific' successors.

New car smell or an old banger? Does Hilary Clinton have what it takes to be the next President. She has said that she will announce her decision to run at the start of next year

'She hasn't announced so I don't wanna jump the gun. I can tell you a couple things. Number one, she was an outstanding secretary of State. Number two, she's a friend,' Obama said.

'Number three, I think she and a number of other possible Democratic candidates would be terrific presidents.'

Obama acknowledged that he expects  Clinton to stake out positions that may be different from his if she runs for president in 2016.

Clinton, who lost to Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination race and served as his secretary of state in his first term, is considering a run in 2016.

Clinton has said she'll decide whether to run early next year.
