France is filled with foreboding about the fate that awaits Philippe Saint-Andre's misfiring team at Twickenham.

The coach has come in for fierce criticism during another RBS Six Nations campaign of grinding, mid-table mediocrity, but according to two members of the last Gallic team to win a championship match in London, exactly a decade ago, the problems run deeper than the man in charge. 

Their primary concerns are the mass influx of overseas players into the Top 14 league which has stalled the development of home-grown talent – and the death of French flair.

There is still a mathematical chance that Les Bleus can win the title this weekend, but that is pie in the sky and cannot disguise their chronic limitations. 

Dimitri Yachvili, the goal-kicking hero of France's 18-17 win at the home of their fiercest rivals in 2005, describes it as a 'bad time for our rugby' and suggests that the booming import trade is the primary issue.

'To me, the problem is that we have too many foreign players in the Top 14 and all the good young French players don't play enough,' said the former Biarritz scrum-half. 'The clubs prefer buying a South African player, or a Kiwi player or an Australian player – maybe because they think it is safer to do that. The young players don't play and that is not good.

'When young players arrive in the French team, they don't have enough experience of the high level. A few years ago, you had to be good for one or two years for your club, before you could be picked for France. Now you just have to do one good move in a match.

Former France scrum half Dimitri Yachvili fires out a pass during his side's clash against England in 2004 

Yachvili's sublime goal-kicking performance secured France's last victory at Twickenham back in 2005 

'Against Wales at Stade de France and against Ireland in Dublin, we were not very far from winning those games, but we are missing the experience that is needed. If we didn't have so many foreign players in our league, the players would have more experience and we could win those games.'

Serge Betsen was another stalwart of the France team that stormed the Twickenham barricades 10 years ago. The ex-Biarritz and Wasps flanker is also worried about the lack of player development in his country, adding: 'The politicians need to help the youngsters to get experience at the highest level. English rugby organises things to give their national players priority.

'During my time at Biarritz, I played with Joe Roff, who won the World Cup with Australia. These kind of players showed me how to improve. To be in contact with them is important, but you still need to give opportunities to the youngsters. We've got a lot of talented players like Gael Fickou and Wesley Fofana. But Fickou needs the time to express his talent. I don't know why he hasn't had the time.'

Noa Nakaitaci

Once captain of the Fiji schoolboys team, the powerful winger moved to France after Clermont Auvergne set up an academy in the Pacific Islands.

He signed with the Top 14 club in 2011 and made his France debut two years later.

Rory Kockott

The scrum-half was snapped up by Les Bleus as soon as he became eligible for selection through the three-year residency rule.

He was tipped as a Springboks star following his time with the Natal Sharks but was overlooked by South Africa coach Heyneke Meyer.

Bernard Le Roux

Despite being born and raised in Moorreesburg, South Africa, the flanker made his rugby debut in Amsterdam.

He joined the Border Bulldogs on the Eastern Cape and was offered a deal with the Lions but opted for a move to Racing Metro.

Scott Spedding

Born in Krugersdorp, South Africa, the full back came through the Natal Sharks academy and represented the Springboks at Under 21 level. He signed for Brive in 2008 before moving to Bayonne and was granted a French passport last year.

The decline of the renowned French flair has been in evidence at Test and club level for several years now. A nation once known for cavalier attacking play which conjured such iconic moments as the fabled 'Try from the end of the earth' in Auckland in 1994 has largely adopted a more pragmatic, Anglo-Saxon reliance on brute force.

Asked if his country have tried too hard to play like England, Yachvili said: 'Yes, yes. We have lost our French rugby a little bit, because a lot of foreign players have come to play for the French clubs and they have another culture and another way of playing. We must try to keep the French flair, but I think we have lost that a bit.

'It is in our DNA to play intuitive rugby. We don't have the best organisation and the best game-plans in the world, but what we have more than other nations is this way to attack from everywhere. But we must be open-minded and free to play this rugby, and at the moment I think we're not free.'

Betsen echoed his former team-mate, adding: 'England has taken parts of the French to add that X-factor to their game – guys like George Ford – who aren't just about kicking but can spot the gap.

'French rugby tried to follow other nations and copy their way of doing things, but it's not always been effective. We want players to practise weights more than passing, but we need a more holistic approach. The flair comes with confidence and trust. You need panache, enjoyment and excitement; sometimes that's been missing.'

What has not been lost along the way is a fervent passion for this classic fixture. The cross-Channel rivalry stirs French blood as much as it ever did. An admiration for those who wear the Red Rose is temporarily shelved at kick-off time.

'We like English rugby, but we hate them just for 80 minutes!' said Yachvili, who spent a season at Gloucester. 'They are very good players, they are very well organised, they have a very good game-plan and we respect them, but for 80 minutes it will always be a very big battle.

Betsen believes players such as Gael Fickou (left) and Wesley Fofana are hindered by the current system 

'Of course, it is the biggest game for us. It is historic and it is always special. It is Le Crunch. It is the last game this year and England can still win the Six Nations. For us, we will be more scared before the game than last week or against Wales at home, but I'm hoping we can do something special.'

That is certainly what Yachvili did in 2005. It was his special goal-kicking that helped France rally from a 17-6 half-time deficit to win 18-17. As it turns out, he was assisted with his match-winning efforts by an Englishman, whose identity remains a secret.

'It was crazy because, in the captain's run training session the day before the game, my kicking was very bad and my coach was very scared about the game,' he said. 'But in the game, I think one kick hit the post but the rest were good.

'I broke my kicking tee in the captain's run training session and I had to ask a friend living in London where I could buy a tee, because I wanted the same one. He said the only shop around was at Twickenham, so he went to buy my tee for the game there, but nobody knew it! I will not tell you the name of the friend, but he is English!'

France surely won't be short of a tee or two this time, but better preparation may not be enough to end their long wait for a championship win in the English capital. 

But Yachvili hasn't abandoned all hope. 'When people think we are no good, that is when France do something,' he said – ominously for the home side. 'On paper, we would say England will beat us easily, because their rugby is more efficient and much better than us right now. But with French rugby, we never know.'
