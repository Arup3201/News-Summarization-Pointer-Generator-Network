An idyllic cottage which was owned by the co-founder of Rolls-Royce when he launched the car manufacturer over a century ago has been put on the market for £2.2million.

The four-bedroom Brae Cottage, in Knutsford, Cheshire, was occupied by Sir Henry Royce for nearly ten years from 1898.

It was during that time he first met fellow engineer Charles Rolls, who went on to become the other co-founding member of their luxury car manufacturer.

Despite being over 100 years since he left, the home still has a number of features to remind people of its famous owner who lived there when Rolls-Royce was born

They started working together in 1904 and, two years later, Rolls-Royce was officially founded.

Mr Royce would often use the home as a base for his work, testing his quadricycle on the drive and experimenting on inventions in the basement.

However, in 1907 when the pair moved the company to Derby, Mr Royce sold his beloved Brae Cottage.

Despite being more than 100 years since he left, the home still has a number of features to remind people of its famous former owner.

The greenhouse was built by the famous engineer and the home retains its original bathroom.

There is also a date stone at the front of the house with his and his wife Minnie Grace’s initials carved in.

The cottage, which was built by Paul Ogen, boasts four double bedrooms, two bathrooms and the extensive basement where Mr Royce carried out a lot of his work

It also features a grand entrance hall, large garden room, converted loft room, walk-in storage area, cellar and an oil storage area, as well as its original bathroom

The property, which was one of the first houses to have electricity in the area, with the power originally coming from a room in the garden, has now been put up for sale for £2.2million.

Charles Rolls (left) and Henry Royce (right) formed their partnership in 1904 before creating car manufacturer Rolls-Royce in 1906

British engineer Henry Royce got into the motor industry in 1902 after buying a French-built Decauville, which he was dissatisfied with and wished to improve on.

Less than a year later, he had turned his full attention to building the best cars in the world and had designed and built his first engine. His first prototypes took to the road in 1904.

It was at this time he met Charles Rolls, an engineer and salesman who sold quality cars in London.

In 1906, the two agreed to manufacture a range that would bear the name Rolls-Royce and the soon-to-be successful business was born.

The series of two, three, four and six cylinder cars broke the mould for engineering and craftsmanship.

In 1907, they launched the Silver Ghost, which completed a 14,371 mile run virtually non-stop to create ‘the best car in the world’ legend.

Following success in the motor industry, the company branched into aero engines in 1914 to meet the need in Britain for air power for the First World War, before moving into the civil aviation sector.

Charles Rolls tragically died in a plane crash in 1910, while Sir Henry Royce passed away in 1933 at the age of 70.

Nowadays Rolls-Royce is owned by BMW and is based in Goodwood, Sussex, where its operations span the civil aerospace, defence, marine and energy sector.

The company is directly responsible for two per cent of total UK goods exports and is currently experiencing its best ever period of sales and profits.

Rolls-Royce engines power 600 airlines around the world including more than 40 of the top 50. Its engines power more than 5.5million commercial flights a year, making it Europe's largest aircraft engine maker.

Among their defence products are fighter jet engines, helicopter engines and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.

Rolls-Royce has more than 40,000 workers worldwide in 50 countries, including 21,000 in the UK.
