His sons may be football fans already, but it's becoming apparent that David Beckham's daughter, Harper Seven, is following suit.

The little girl, who will be four months old on November 10, was on hand to watch her father and his football team LA Galaxy win their way into the MLS Cup finals in Carson, California yesterday - a first for Beckham during his lucrative $1m-a-week five-year contract with the club.

However,
given that Harper has only just started to become a fixture at the 
games, it could be said that she was something of a good luck charm for 
her dear old daddy.

His team won 3-1 over Real Salt Lake 
in the Western Conference final; they will now advance to play in the 
MLS Cup on November 20.

Daddy's little charmer: Harper Seven and mother Victoria Beckham watch dad David play a football match in Carson, California yesterday

Clad in an adorable flowered romper, Harper couldn't seem to stop watching her dad on the football pitch.

She looked awestruck by the action on
the field and her mother, 37-year-old fashion designer Victoria, 
focused all of her attention on her daughter.

Harper has been seen quite frequently at LA Galaxy matches lately, proving that it isn't just her big brothers that will grow up loving football.

Brooklyn, 12, Romeo, nine, and six-year-old Cruz are often seen cheering on their superstar father at his games.

They, too, watched today's game. They
split a sushi snack in the skybox before heading down on to the field to 
congratulate their dad after he helped to win the match against Real 
Salt Lake.

Brooklyn may have been hobbling on crutches, but that wasn't going to prevent him from being part of the action and revelry.

There was definitely a celebratory feeling on the field, especially on Beckham's behalf, given that he was one of the game's stars.  

On November 20, Beckham will face Houston Dynamo in what will come as his first MLS title in what is likely to be the final game of five-year contract with the Galaxy.

But Beckham won't be interested in celebrating his best season in MLS unless 
the Galaxy can get another win and raise another trophy in two weeks.

The English sporting star is yet to 
decide where he will play next - but if this is his last season with the
America club it will come as his most successful yet.

Speaking earlier this week, before 
Thursday's home win against the New York Red Bulls, Beckham noted: 
'Obviously, if you look at statistics and the games I’ve played, it is 
the best season since I moved to L.A

'It’s nice to have that at 36 years 
old, because people start to doubt you, but it’s the best season I’ve 
had since I moved here. The management, the team, everything has been 
set up perfectly. It’s been a great year.'

Harper, meanwhile has already displayed an 
uncanny knack for looking fabulous in clothing, and has accompanied her 
mother on many recent shopping trips.

The boys, however, are absolutely following in their father's footsteps.

They already play football while their supportive superstar father coaches from the sidelines.

He expressed concern recently that 
his children would grow up to be too coddled, and desires that they 
should make their own ways in the world.

'They've got a great life set up for 
them,' the 36-year-old athlete told the Times. 'Obviously our boys and 
little girl are very lucky.'

'But I think, as a parent, you always worry: "Have they got the hunger that I had as a kid?"

He said: 'I'm as hard on my boys as 
my dad was. They always ask, "Did I play well?" I'll say, "You did 
alright, could have done better..."

'The way my dad brought me up, he was strict. I'm exactly the same with my boys. They have their feet on the ground.'
