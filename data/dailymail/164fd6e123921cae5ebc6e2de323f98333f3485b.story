Manchester City face a daunting trip to the Allianz Arena to face Bundesliga winners Bayern Munich on Wednesday night in their opening Champions League encounter.

The two sides have been drawn in the same group together for the third time in four seasons, meaning this is their fifth encounter since September 2011.

Here, Sportsmail looks at how the two side's likely starting line-ups compare... 

BAYERN MUNICH

MANUEL NEUER - 9

The sweeper keeper is the best in the world. He takes strong command of his area and it usually takes something special to beat him.

German World Cup-winning goalkeeper Manuel Neuer will hope to keep a clean sheet against Manchester City

DAVID ALABA - 7.5

Young Austrian has recovered from being elbowed in the face by Zlatan Ibrahimovic on international duty.

Poses danger going forward. 

David Alaba is likely to form part of a Bayern back three against Manchester City at the Allianz Arena

JEROME BOATENG - 8 

Pacey defender who rarely misplaces a pass.

Vastly improved from the player he was at the Etihad.

DANTE - 6.5

The bulky Brazilian defender can lose concentration easily.

Could be a weak link for City to exploit.

Dante (centre) will be at the heart of Bayern's defence as they look to beat Man City in the Champions League

PHILIPP LAHM - 8.5 

A consistent performer, steady passer and solid defender. 

Philipp Lahm will captain Bayern Munich from the heart of midfield against Manchester City on Wednesday

XABI ALONSO - 7.5

Will try to dictate the pace of the game.

In the absence of Bastian Schweinsteiger will be an important player in midfield. 

Xabi Alonso has thrived in midfield for new side Bayern Munich since his summer switch from Real Madrid

MARIO GOTZE - 7.5

Scored the winning goal in the World Cup final and netted in Bayern’s 2-0 Bundesliga win over Stuttgart last week.

Mario Gotze (centre) scored the winning goal in the World Cup final and will be a threat to the City defence

JUAN BERNAT - 7 

Bayern new boy is a Spanish under-21 international signed from Valencia. 

Highly rated for his tackling and danger he poses to opposition defence.

XHERDAN SHAQIRI - 7.5 

The 5ft 6in midfielder was a transfer target for Liverpool.

His speed can be difficult to deal with. 

Xherdan Shaqiri scored a hat-trick at the World Cup and will aim to break down the Manchester City defence

THOMAS MULLER - 8.5

This unorthodox striker sometimes appears bumbling but he works hard, has great awareness and scores plenty of goals. 

Thomas Muller scores important goals for club and country and will work his heart out for Bayern Munich

ROBERT LEWANDOWSKI - 8.5

Polish front man has yet to find his feet at Bayern since joining from Borussia Dortmund in the summer but he thrives on the big occasions. 

TEAM AVERAGE - 7.8 

Robert Lewandowski was Pep Guardiola's big summer signing and he is a predator in front of opposition goal

MANCHESTER CITY

JOE HART - 7.5

Commands respects from teammates but can get himself in sticky situations.

Was beaten at his near post by Franck Ribery in Bayern’s 3-1 victory at the Etihad last season. 

Joe Hart was dropped after struggling against Bayern last season so it is a huge match for the City stopper

BACARY SAGNA - 7

A capable deputy for Pablo Zabaleta but perhaps does not possess the same blood-and-guts determination as the fearsome Argentine.

Bacary Sagna (left) will make his Champions League debut for Manchester City at the Allianz against Bayern

VINCENT KOMPANY - 8

The captain is a fearless and steely presence in defence. Important because of the discipline he instils on the pitch. 

Vincent Kompany, Manchester City's captain, will be key to his side's chances at the heart of their defence

MARTIN DEMICHELIS - 7 

Has improved concentration levels but still prone to the occasional defensive error.

A useful aerial threat from set pieces as demonstrated against Arsenal last week.

Martin Demichelis has gone from a laughing stock last season to Mr Dependable at the back for Man City

ALEKSANDR KOLAROV - 8

Has a sweet left foot and has scored two Champions League goals for City which bodes well.

Aleksandr Kolarov will offer an attacking threat from left-back for City but he can be caught out defensively

YAYA TOURE - 8.5

Dominates and still very much the focal point of the City midfield. 

On the brink of signing new contract at the Etihad according to Kompany.

Yaya Toure should return in midfield and his power will be a key asset for City in the middle of the park

FERNANDINHO - 7

Cannot be faulted for his commitment to the cause.

Works tirelessly and makes crucial tackles. 

Fernandinho will once again shield the Manchester City back four from Bayern Munich's attacking threats

DAVID SILVA - 8.5

Oozes class on the ball, the midfield magician can fashion a chance out of the most fleeting of opportunities. 

David Silva is crucial to Manchester City's attacking plans and he will aim to thread balls through for strikers

SERGIO AGUERO - 9

He and Silva are the players that will most scare Bayern.

Possesses an exciting burst of speed and capable of getting in behind defenders.

Sergio Aguero is in fantastic goal-scoring form and he will hope to continue that on Wednesday at the Allianz

SAMIR NASRI - 7.5

Creative and versatile but sometimes shirks defensive responsibilities.

Samir Nasri can blow hot and cold but he is on song he is dangerous due to his trickery and guile

EDIN DZEKO - 7.5

Vastly improved under the tutelage of Manuel Pelligrini.

Looks hungry for the ball and is sharp in the box. 

TEAM AVERAGE - 7.6 

Edin Dzeko looks likely to be given the task of leading the line for City against Bayern at the Allianz Arena
