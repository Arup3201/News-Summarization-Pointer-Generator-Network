The 24-year-old Maiden Gully man, who handed himself into police on Sunday afternoon, has been charged with eight offences including reckless conduct endangering life, manufacture explosive substance, criminal damage and cause explosion likely to endanger life. 

Police allege that three explosive devices were found after two exploded on Saturday night.

Police have charged a 24-year-old man after two bombs exploded in Bendigo, Victoria on Saturday night

No injuries have been reported as a result of the explosions and the man has been bailed to appear at Bendigo Magistrates Court on December 23.

Investigating officers earlier launched an appeal for a group of people dressed in Santa costumes, who were in the area that the bombs exploded in last night to come forward.

A police spokesperson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that the 24-year-old man was only person in that group who was involved in the incident.  

The streets in Bendigo are now open after the bomb disposal unit cleared the scene, however an arson chemist remained to assess the situation.

Residents alerted the police to the bombs after they heard loud bangs in the area about 10pm last night.

Police found the explosive devices in a bag at around 2am in a laneway in Hargreaves Street. 

Speaking to 9News, Detective Sergeant Steve Rainey described it as a 'moronic' Saturday night prank. 

'It could have had catastrophic effects for anyone,' he said.
