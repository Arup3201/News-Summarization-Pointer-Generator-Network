 The British are coming! The British are coming!

Hamleys, the most popular and oldest toy store in all of Britain, has set its sights on America, and is making plans to roll out stores across the country.

They are currently looking at locations in New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles.

The trade journal Property Week is also reporting that Hamleys may open 20 smaller storefronts in airports around the United States.

One of the best known stores in the world, Hamleys first opened back in London in 1760 under the name Noah's Ark, with the flagship moving to its current location on Regent Street in 1881 and its name being changed to Hamleys in honor of founder William Hamley.

The flagship is said to contain upwards of 50,000 toys over seven floors, and has become a major tourist destination in its own right.

The company has been expanding since it was purchased by French retailer Groupe Ludendo in 2012 and now has close to 40 stores around the world in locations like Mumbai, Moscow and even the Saudi capital of Riyadh.

And while Hamleys has thrived overseas, American staples like Toys 'R' Us and F.A.O. Schwartz can take solace in the fact that many British exports have a difficult time thriving in America.

With the exception of TopShop and One Direction, few British institutions have found success in the United States of recent.
