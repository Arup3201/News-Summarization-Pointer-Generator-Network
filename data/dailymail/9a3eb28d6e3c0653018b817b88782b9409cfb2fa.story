Barring an unfortunate lightning strike, it looks like Alex Rodriguez was right - he will be in the Yankees’ lineup Monday night.

Despite multiple reports claiming to confirm Major League Baseball will announce on Monday a 214 game suspension – along with 50 game bans for as many as 15 others – of the tarnished player, Rodriguez will be able to play Monday night. The accused cheater’s plan to appeal the suspension allows for him to be on the field until an arbitrator hears the case.

Despite openly defying the league and practically daring MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to ban him for life, Rodriguez is able to appeal because of how the suspension is being handed down.

What, me worry?: Alex Rodriguez is expected to appeal his suspension allowing him to play until the case is heard by an arbitrator

Expected to be announced at 12pm Monday, Rodriguez’s suspension can be appealed because it will be handled exactly as the other suspensions set to be announced – as part of the joint drug agreement, according to reports.

By suspending the slugger, who boasted on Friday that he’d play for the Yankees Monday unless he was ‘struck by lightning,’ in that manner, Selig enables Rodriguez to appeal to an arbitrator under the guidelines of drug testing regime agreed to between the league and the player’s union. A lifetime ban is no longer being considered, according to CBS Sports’ Jon Heyman.

Per the JGA, Rodriguez can don the pinstripes until a decision is reached by an arbitrator, allowing him to play Monday night and into the immediate future, at the very least. The Yankees have no choice but to activate the aging slugger if he is ready to play.

The teams of all players involved have been notified of their suspensions, according to the New York Daily News. Almost all of the players are expected to accept the suspensions without appeal, the league also notified Yankees that Rodriguez will appeal the suspension, the paper noted. Should an arbitrator side with the league and uphold the suspension in full, it would likely carry into the 2015 season, a risk Rodriguez appears willing to take.

Originally reported to be 12 players, including a few minor leaguers, the total suspended is now expected to be 15, Heyman originally reported Sunday afternoon. It is not known who the three additional players are – but they will not be Oakland A’s pitcher Bartolo Colon, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera or San Diego Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal since they were suspended last year for use of performance enhancing drugs.

In taking his case to an arbitrator, Rodriguez, 38, will likely try to throw the Yankees – a team that will have paid him over $275million by the end of this season – under a bus for a host of reasons.

Rodriguez plans to accuse team doctors of misdiagnosing injuries and the Yankees of mishandling injuries of his as far back as 2009 – which forced him to seek alternatives that would put him back on the field, according to the Daily News.

The long-fading star may also point to the fact that the longest suspension served for a PED-related offense since the drug testing program went into effect in 2005 was 100 games after Giants’ pitcher Guillermo Mota’s second positive test. A-Rod has never tested positive for PEDs.

Despite the level of vitriol directed at the team, manager Joe Girardi told reporters in San Diego Sunday that he has the accused steroid cheat ‘penciled in’ for Monday.

‘He's in there, and I'm going to play him," Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after New York's 6-3 loss at San Diego.’

The three-time MVP brazenly declared Saturday that he’d be flying to Chicago to join the team for Monday’s game, but there are still doubts Rodriguez can play third base on an everyday basis after 20 years in the Major Leagues, especially coming off his second hip surgery.

Rodriguez only played a full nine innings once during his most recent rehab stint at Double-A Trenton, and had very few chances in the field. He did hit a two-run home run Friday night, in addition to cleanly fielding the only two chances he had at third, but he only played five innings. The 14-time all-star walked in all four of his plate appearances during his final minor league game Saturday night.

Shortly after hitting the home run, Rodriguez went rogue during a post-game news conference.

The alleged cheat accused both the Yankees and MLB of conspiring to keep him off the field and void his contract.

‘There is more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field. And that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankee fans,’ the tormented slugger said, adding, ‘when all this stuff is going on in the background and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract and stuff like that, I think that's concerning for me.’

Though teammates have supported the paranoid pariah’s return to the team while on the record, many reports have them saying off the record that he will be an unnecessary distraction, something Girardi publicly disagreed with.

‘I don't suspect it'll be awkward. Most of these guys know him as a teammate and have laughed a lot with Alex and been around Alex a lot,’ he said. ‘I think it'll be business as usual. I'm sure there will be more media there, obviously, tomorrow, but I think that's probably more for Alex to deal with than the rest of the guys. I don't think it'll be a big deal.’

Big deal or not, A-Rod was right, all signs point to him being in the road greys Monday night against the White Sox, unless he is struck by lightning.
