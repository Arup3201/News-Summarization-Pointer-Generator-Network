Supporters of a charity that provides books for school children were caught by undercover investigators chanting 'White Power', and using slogans from Hitler's Mein Kampf.

The Steadfast Trust bills itself as being 'the first and only registered charity which undertakes work specifically for the English community' but has been accused of attracting far right extremists.

Now an undercover investigation team has secretly filmed charity supporters giving Nazi salutes, chanting 'white power' and 'victory to the Aryan race', and using references to Hitler.

The Steadfast Trust bills itself as being 'the first and only registered charity which undertakes work specifically for the English community' but has been accused of attracting far right extremists

The footage will be shown on ITV tonight, during an Exposure documentary called Charities Behaving Badly.

Undercover reporters spent a year infiltrating The Steadfast Trust, as well as Islamic charity The Global Aid Trust, where they witnessed a charity worker expressing his support for the Charlie Hebdo killers' mentor, and The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh UK charity - where children at a summer camp were told Islam is the 'world's worst religion'.

In footage shot with supporters of The Steadfast Trust at an event to mark the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD, one man - whose name is given as Piers, explains how he was once a candidate for far right political party the National Front, and was involved with the Klu Klux Klan.

Steadfast Trustee Tim Hawke raises a toast to England at an event to mark the Battle of Maldon in 991 AD

'I was a candidate for the National Front in the 1980 something,' he says. 'When the Ku Klux Klan started up over here I got involved in that.

'A lot of us here took it to the extreme, where we was actually going out and mob up and attack them. That's because all we had. We didn't have the Steadfast charity years ago.'

The group are then shown making Nazi salutes, as well as chanting 'white power' and 'victory to the Aryan race'.

One man at the event uses the phrase '14 Words',  a reference to a quote from Hitler's book, Mein Kampf, which states: 'We must ensure the existence of our people and a future for our white children'. 

Members are also seen using the n-word, and insulting a boy aged around five from a mixed race family. 

Elsewhere in the documentary, Steadfast trustee Tim Hawke, who had previously explained that one of the Trust's main duties is providing books and storytellers for schools, is shown referring to a group in Chelmsford as 'Burn the Mosques'.

He adds: 'They’re not going to burn the mosques down. Maybe if there was a strong, Nationalist, English focus, and there was more militancy – that might happen. It’s not gonna happen in the next few years. Maybe it’ll happen in the future, but not now.'

A spokesman for the Steadfast Trust, which has now had its charity status removed, said: 'Tim Hawke has been suspended pending an internal investigation.

Elsewhere in the documentary, Steadfast trustee Mr Hawke is shown suggesting 'Burn the Mosques' as a name for a group in Chelmsford, Essex

A spokesman for the Steadfast Trust, which has now had its charity status removed, said: 'Tim Hawke has been suspended pending an internal investigation'

It added: 'The Trust does not share or support the offensive views expressed, some by people unknown to the charity.

'We cannot be held responsible for the views, actions or political affiliations of our supporters.'

'The Steadfast Trust is not and has never been political in its aims and we are perplexed by the suggestion it has become the focal point of the far right.'

A spokesman for the Charities Commission said: 'Steadfast Trust is not a charity and has been removed from the Register of Charities. We made this decision because there are rules in law about who can benefit from a charity.

'In this case it was not clear that the Trust's beneficiaries, described as 'members of the Anglo-Saxon community living in England', could be identified or are a sufficient section of the public, as required in charity law.

'As the Trust's purposes are not charitable for the public benefit, the Trust is not a charity.'

The Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh UK (HSS) claims it 'advances the Hindu religion and educates the public in the Hindu ideals and way of life'.

HSS says the camp gives volunteers a chance to discuss their opinions without censorship, but the charity is not 'anti any other religion'

However, at a leadership camp at a school in Hertfordshire, children are seen being told by a teacher: 'To destroy the Hindu history is the secret conspiracy of the Christians.' 

And when a child asks Child: 'Do you think Muslims are the biggest problem for Britain?', a teacher responds: 'Yes. For everybody, for everybody.'

After the class he adds: 'See if it comes to Islam they are the World’s worst religion and they don’t have common sense to find out what is humanity and all that.' 

A spokesman from HSS UK said: 'The depiction of us as anti any other religion is wrong and counterproductive to the positive work HSS has done in building interfaith relations.

'We promote Hindu values which are about cohesiveness, duty to society and universal peace.

'Our actions over the years show that HSS promotes diversity and unity in Britain.

'Our training camp is attended by a cross section of society and we try to give our volunteers an opportunity to discuss their opinions and understand all views.

'There are some strong views on interfaith issues but these are personal views.

'We do not deny these views exist nor do we seek to censor or ignore them and we strongly oppose any suggestion that by not censoring them we promote or agree with them.

'We are investigating these alleged comments to ensure those who made them are better informed, trained or prevented from making statements which may be interpreted as anti another community.

'The Teacher said to us that that he does not intend any harm or hurt to other people or cultures and regrets that any words could be misconstrued to create disharmony.'

Rizwan Hussain, the chief executive of the east London-based Global Aid Trust has stepped down from the charity ahead of the documentary.

A GAT worker called Saffiq Shabbar (pictured) is shown speaking of his admiration for hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was believed to have inspired a string of terror attacks, including the Charlie Hebdo shootings

Mr Shabbar tells the reporter: 'He incited bombings basically. Bruv, he was a brilliant guy though'

In the programme the undercover reporter, posing as a volunteer, is introduced to a GAT worker called Shaffiq Shabbar who tells him of his admiration for the late hate preacher Anwar al-Awlaki, who was believed to have inspired a string of terror attacks, including the Charlie Hebdo shootings.

Mr Shabbar tells the reporter: 'They spread loads of lies about him...He's a scholar and basically he was imprisoned and after he came out of prison he started to incite hatred and telling the Western Muslims to bomb.

'He incited bombings basically. Bruv, he was a brilliant guy though.'

The documentary also shows preacher Dawah Man speaking at an event in which he makes a series of anti-Semitic comments, telling those gathered: 'America, European countries, whatever you call it, these countries are controlled by Zionists.

'If you look at the biggest bankers in the world, that fund these countries, they are Zionists, and Zionists run Israel. So we can safely say that at any time there was an American, or English or whatever, invasion of the Muslim lands, it is all a problem coming back to the Children of Israel.'

In the programme GAT said it 'firmly condemns and reject comments' made by Mr Shabbar and the external speakers.

It adds: 'We express our great regret at these incidents, which were the result of a process failure in the organisation.'

Rizwan Hussain, the chief executive of east London-based Global Aid Trust has stepped down from the charity ahead of the documentary probing whether the organisation was promoting extremism

It confirms that Mr Hussain left GAT in December 2014.

GAT claimed that a due diligence form regarding the content of what the speaker might say was not provided when he was booked and that the staff member responsible was suspended and later resigned

The Charity Commission, which has already opened a case against GAT, has been told of the footage.

A spokesman said they were 'already aware that there were concerns of a similar nature' regarding 'allegations of links to extremism' against GAT.

He said the new evidence will be added to its current case, noting: 'The claim is that they had invited external speakers to events without doing proper checks on the individuals or as to what they would be saying at the event.

'Certainly the film evidence is of someone who has been invited to an event and it is clear that a young lad has no steer about what he should be checking or asking of that person.'

Mr Hussain, who is also a television presenter for the Islam Channel and a barrister, told Third Sector magazine that he had left the charity 'in connection with the documentary'.

GAT describes itself as an independent charity which aims to promote education among the underprivileged and to help orphans achieve their full potential.

The Charity Commission said it had visited and inspected GAT's premises in November 2014 after 'concerns' were identified regarding one of GAT's events in May 2014. 

A spokesman said: 'We are already taking action in relation to a number of concerns raised with us as a result of undercover filming in charities undertaken by a TV production company . We remain in contact with the film makers regarding the final broadcast and have requested all footage. We will issue an update on our regulatory action when appropriate to do so.'
