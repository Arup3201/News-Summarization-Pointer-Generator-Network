A conman who made £50million by selling fake bomb detectors based on £13 novelty golf ball finders caused the deaths of innocent victims in war zones, a judge said yesterday.

James McCormick, 57, was jailed for ten years for selling the ‘useless devices’ for ‘enormous profit’ to police forces and armies around the world, including Iraq

As pictures of the fraudster enjoying his ill-gotten gains emerged, Judge Richard Hone QC condemned McCormick for his ‘greedy’ pursuit of an extravagant lifestyle which included buying grand homes and a luxury yacht.

McCormick, 57, showed no reaction as he was told his callous confidence trick was the worst fraud imaginable

He said McCormick’s ‘cavalier 
disregard of the potentially fatal consequences’ of his racket convinced
him to pass the maximum sentence he could.

He added: ‘In terms of culpability and harm, I have been unable to imagine a more serious case of its kind.

‘The device was useless, the profits outrageous and your culpability as a fraudster has to be placed in the highest category.

‘I am wholly satisfied that your 
fraudulent conduct in selling so many useless devices for simply 
enormous profit promoted a false sense of security and in all 
probability materially contributed to causing death and injury to 
innocent individuals.’

Judge Hone said the devices are still being used in some areas where they continue to put lives in danger.

‘You have neither insight, shame or 
any sense of remorse,’ the judge added. ‘Even now you insist they work, 
in a vain effort to minimise your culpability.

‘You fought the case in the teeth of 
overwhelming evidence. In a last desperate gamble you rolled the dice 
with the jury and lost.’

The majority of the conman’s fake 
detectors were sold to Iraq where they were used at virtually every 
checkpoint in Baghdad and Basra from 2006.

The gadgets are essentially just hand-held aerials fixed to plastic hinges.

Somehow, however, McCormick persuaded
governments and military chiefs that they could detect tiny traces of 
explosives, drugs, ivory and even humans at a distance of up to three 
miles. As he secured deals, he was wined and dined by governments and 
flown around in their jets

Senior British and Iraqi security 
officials believe his scam allowed suicide bombers to kill and maim 
thousands. On one occasion terrorists drove a vehicle laden with rockets
and missiles through 23 checkpoints in Baghdad where the device was 
used.

McCormick, a former trainee 
policeman, used the millions he was paid to fund a lavish lifestyle. He 
owned a £5million Regency townhouse in Bath, a £1.5million farmhouse 
near Taunton, Somerset, a £250,000 holiday home in Florida and a 
£350,000 villa in Cyprus.

The conman also spent £630,000 on a 
Sunseeker yacht and £210,000 on three horses for one of his two 
daughters who wants to compete in the British dressage team at the 2016 
Olympics.

Although police have frozen 
£15million of his assets, investigators believe he has laundered at 
least a further £15million through Cyprus, Belize and Beirut.

The Iraqi government spent £56million
on the fake bomb detectors, some of which was paid as bribes to senior 
figures. These included General Jihad al-Jabiri, head of the Baghdad 
bomb squad, who helped McCormick win the massive contract. He and two 
other Iraqi officials are now serving jail terms for corruption.

fide bomb detectors

Model: Advanced Detection Equipment 651. Prosecutors said the devices were little more than golf ball finders 

McCormick based the fake detector on a
novelty golf ball finder called a Golfinder. He imported large 
shipments of them from the US from 2005. He claimed they worked by using
electrostatic energy from the human body, coming to life after the user
has shuffled their feet or walked a few steps.

Users were given a variety of cards supposedly programmed to detect different substances.

At first he simply attached stickers 
bearing the words ‘International Association of Bomb Technicians’ to the
golf ball finders to make them look authentic.

Glossy brochures marketing the 
devices promised that they could pick up substances up to 100ft 
underwater or 30ft underground. The conman said they could also detect 
fluids and human beings.

Later versions of the device were 
modified slightly, but still closely resembled the golf ball finders. 
McCormick reeled in clients with sales talks in which he purported to 
explain the science behind his system.

He even claimed to have a doctorate –despite leaving school in Liverpool with just three O-levels.

McCormick denied three charges of fraud, but was found guilty by a jury last week.
