Disgraced International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by a New York hotel maid who accused him of trying to rape her, it was revealed on Thursday

Nafissatou Diallo has pursued her lawsuit against the once-powerful French politician, claiming he committed a 'violent and sadistic attack,' despite prosecutors dropping sexual assault charges against him.

With the settlement, Strauss-Kahn, 63, no doubt hopes to put behind him the scandal that cost him his job, his political career, his reputation and his marriage.

Battered: Dominique Strauss-Kahn lost his political career and his job as the head of the IMF over allegations he tried to rape a hotel maid

The 63-year-old, who was once widely predicted to be the next president of France, admits he had sex with the housekeeper at New York's Sofitel Hotel in May 2011 - but maintains it was consensual.

Details of the settlement, including any money paid to Miss Diallo, were not available.

Accuser: Nafissatou Diallo maintained her claims the she was the victim of a 'violent, sadistic attack,' despite criminal charges being dropped

Sources told the New York Times that the deal hadn't been formally signed yet, though both side agreed to the terms.

Bronx Supreme Court Judge Douglas McKeon facilitated the agreement. Lawyers for both Strauss-Kahn and Miss Diallo are scheduled to appear in court next week.

Prosecutors in Manhattan dismissed sexual assault charges against Strauss-Kahn three months after he was arrested.

Legal observers widely believe the District Attorney believed that Miss Diallo's claims lost credibility when a past criminal record in her native Guinea became public.Â 

It was also revealed that she allegedly lied on a document requesting asylum in the U.S.

Strauss-Kahn
counter-sued Miss Diallo, claiming that her allegations were false an 
that she had permanently damaged his public image.

The
dramatic arrest of Strauss-Kahn, who was handcuffed and hauled off a 
plane at JFK International Airport on his way back to France, led to a 
flood of other accusers stepping forward.

Journalist
Tristane Banon alleged that father of four daughters sexually assaulted
her during a 2002 interview. French authorities found Banon's 
accusations credible, but dismissed the case because the statue of 
limitations had expired.

In
August, a separate case against Strauss-Kahn centered on allegations of
rape in a Washington, D.C., hotel was dropped after prosecutors said 
the accuser, an escort, changed her account to say no rape was involved 
in the encounter that occurred when Strauss-Kahn still headed the IMF.
