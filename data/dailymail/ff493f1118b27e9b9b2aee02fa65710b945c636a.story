Pineau De Re will claim a place in the pantheon of Grand National winners if he can repeat his 2014 victory next April.

Trainer Dr Richard Newland believes his 11-year-old will have every right to be mentioned in the same breath as three-time winner Red Rum if he can replicate the heroics which saw him beat Balthazar King at Aintree.

The Worcestershire handler said: ‘I believe Pineau De Re is a genuine candidate for the National again.

Pineau De Re is a 'genuine candidate' to win next year's Grand National, claims trainer Dr Richard Newland

Newman believes a repeat victory will place Pineau De Re among the greats like Red Rum

‘I think he is a very classy horse and I like his chance for a number of reasons.

‘Balthazar King was runner-up and he hasn’t let the form down since.

‘Although he is 11, Pineau still has a lot of bounce as he had a bad injury for two years and has only run 35 times. ‘Although he is 11 he acts like he’s three and shows a lot of enthusiasm on the gallops.

‘I am a big fan of Red Rum, but I think the race is harder to win now. If Pineau could win again it would mirror what Red Rum achieved in my eyes.’
