Gus Poyet admits he was seconds away from substituting Adam Johnson before he scored the goal to make it an unprecedented fourth straight victory for Sunderland in Tyne-Wear derbies.

The Black Cats boss had already informed the fourth official of his intention to withdraw the £10million winger with nine minutes remaining when he changed his mind.

It proved a shrewd judgement as Johnson smashed the stoppage-time winner and Sunderland recorded their fourth win on the spin for the first time in the fixture’s 116-year history.

‘I was going to take Adam Johnson off but luckily I didn’t,’ said Poyet.

‘I gave the number to take him off. He then got away, checked in and missed the chance – he got in behind, which is what we were trying to do.

‘I changed my mind and told the fourth official, “no, no, number 10, Connor Wickham”.’

Johnson’s goal was his third in victories on Tyneside in as many seasons.

And the Sunderland-born match-winner said: ‘Three years in a row, they must hate me here.

‘Three wins here and three clean sheets, you can't ask for more.

‘I love playing here. It’s a great ground with a great atmosphere. You always need to rise to the occasion here. I felt disappointed because I should have scored earlier on. If I had missed that chance as well I would have been gutted all night.

‘The manager said it was a good job he left me on. It's massive for us. This was the end of some hard work. It gives us a great boost.’

Poyet has now won all three derby matches as head coach of Sunderland. And the Uruguayan - who is also unbeaten in seven against opposite number Alan Pardew - hailed another special victory over their North-East rivals.

‘It's great, it's incredible,’ he said.

‘When you are on the right side, the good side, you are going to remember it all your life, so it's a special moment for us, a special moment for the club.

‘We were able to continue this winning run against Newcastle, which is great for us, without forgetting that the three points are the main thing.

‘But it makes it a very special Christmas for us.’

Sunderland were headed for a sixth goalless draw of the season before Johnson struck.

Poyet – previously ‘frustrated’ and ‘bored’ by his side’s lack of cutting edge – hopes the win inspires his players heading into the festive fixtures.

Johnson's goal sparked jubilant celebrations from Sunderland  and Newcastle's players were dejected

‘We always talk about confidence – there is no more confidence you can get than beating your biggest rivals in the last minute,’ he said.

‘If somebody thinks differently, they have never played football, never played a derby.

‘Now next week, there are no excuses. Confidence should be high so we are able to create chances against Hull. We need to put the ball in the net. That's the good thing, no excuses.’
