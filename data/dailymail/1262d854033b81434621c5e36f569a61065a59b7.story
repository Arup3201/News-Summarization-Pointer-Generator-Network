More than a third of children now live with unmarried parents in non-traditional families, according to official figures.

Only 63 per cent of dependent youngsters lived in a home headed by a married couple last year, according to the Office for National Statistics – a drop of three percentage points on 2004.

By contrast, the proportion of dependent children – classed as under-16s and those aged 16 to 18 in school or college – living with cohabiting parents rose over the same period from 11 per cent to 14 per cent.

The fall in the share of children in married homes comes at a time of growing evidence that marriage is linked with health and wealth among both parents and children, while cohabiting couples are more likely to have lower incomes. 

Children of married couples are more likely than those with unmarried parents to do well at school and enjoy good health, and to go on to higher education and well-paid jobs.

David Cameron has promised to introduce more state support for marriage. However, the tax break for poorer married parents to be offered this spring has been described by some critics as ‘ridiculous’.

It will mean that 1.6million people who are not higher-rate taxpayers will get only £3.85 a week. Analysts believe that in practice the gain will be even less for more than a million of these people, because for them Coalition benefit reforms will take away £2.50 of the gain.

The Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne have also declined to shift towards fully transferable income tax allowances which advocates of marriage demand. 

The ONS report on Families And Households 2014 said there were 13.8million dependent children in Britain in 2014, 560,000 more than in 2004.

The increase is a result of high immigration and high birth rates, pushed up by immigration.

It said: ‘The types of families in which dependent children live have changed significantly. The biggest change is for dependent children living in opposite sex cohabiting couple families.

‘Over the same period, the percentage of dependent children living in a married couple family fell by three percentage points to 63 per cent in 2014.’

The share of children living with single parents remained at roughly the same level over the decade. Last year, according to figures from the ONS Labour Force Survey, 23 per cent of dependent children were living with lone parents. 

Patricia Morgan, an author on cohabitation and the family, said: ‘This is a disastrous direction to be taking. It is something that has not been tackled by the Government because acting to back marriage is seen as politically incorrect.

‘David Cameron is happy to act in favour of same-sex marriage, but he seems not to want to help opposite sex couples raising children.’

She added: ‘Marriage is under a cloud, but it is better for parents, children, the national budget, and the welfare of the rest of us.’

Children of cohabiting parents are more likely than those of married parents to end up in a broken or single-parent family, as cohabitees are between three and four times more likely to break up than married couples.
