A 25-year-old husband suspected of stabbing his wife to death in a street wrote on Facebook about his desperation over their failed marriage less than an hour before the attack, it emerged today.

Ty Medland said 'Goodbye to all my friends and family’ just 45 minutes before the incident on a city centre street in Brighton, East Sussex, in which his wife Samantha Medland died from stab wounds.

He added that he had asked his 24-year-old wife, who was stabbed to death on Sunday, for two weeks to ‘show her I can be the man she fell in love with’ and wanted ‘a chance to fix our marriage’.

He said: ‘I don't know how to cope or go on. I tried to talk to Sam, to either get some truth or a chance. I asked for two weeks to start to show her I can be me again, the man she fell in love with.

‘A chance to fix our marriage - if nothing changes or she still isn't happy, she can leave and I won't try again, we will have at least tried to save our marriage. She said “no” and blamed it all on me.

‘Tells me she meant it when she married me, but won't give me a reason why she won't give us a chance. I asked for us to go on one last date, to try to make one last happy memory so we aren't just left with the last couple of weeks which have been horrible.

‘So I leave you with this - pictures and videos of my wife, the cheating, lying, unloyal whore, who destroyed everything I love and believed in.

‘Show the world, let her never forget 
what she did to me. Let Christopher Woods have her and I hope they 
destroy each other and it's worth what she did to me.’

Couple: The pair were believed to have married in 2011 in Mrs Medland's home town of Luton, Bedfordshire

The identity of 'Christopher Woods' is as yet unclear. Mrs Medland was stabbed at 8.45pm on Sunday in Queen Square, Brighton, close to where she worked at a Domestic & General call centre.

Mr Medland was arrested on suspicion of her murder and was last night under police guard at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

He has stab wounds himself but his injuries were not life-threatening. The pair were believed to have married in September 2011 in Mrs Medland's home town of Luton, Bedfordshire.

More than 300 comments had been made on 
his Facebook status today, with some posting links to online news 
articles reporting the stabbing.

There was also an 'RIP Samantha Medland' page set up with more than 950 ‘likes’ and people paying tribute to Mrs Medland.

Another, Megan Newall, added: 'I'm so shocked and sorry to hear. She was such a nice girl. Thoughts with her family and friends.'

Detective Inspector Wendy Burton, of 
Surrey and Sussex Police Major Crime Team, said: 'The victim and 
arrested man are known to each other and was not a random attack.

'It took place in the street in Queen Square and was witnessed by passing members of the public and local residents.

'We
are keen to speak to anyone who was in the area at the time of the 
incident so we can build a picture of what has taken place.

'Our thoughts are with the family of the victim as we investigate this incident.'

A Sussex Police spokesman said: 'Sussex Police has launched a murder investigation after a woman was seriously injured in an incident in Queen Square, Brighton, on Sunday 17 February.

'The 24-year-old woman from Peacehaven was taken to hospital suffering from several stab wounds following the incident at around 8.45pm but sadly died a short time later.

'A 25-year-old man also from Peacehaven was arrested at the scene by police. He has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently receiving treatment in hospital for stab wounds to his body.

'These are not believed to be life-threatening and he is under police guard at this time.'
