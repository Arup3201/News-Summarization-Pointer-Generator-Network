A powerful new PSA to raise awareness about domestic violence shows celebrities too overwhelmed with emotion to speak.

Hilary Swank, Mariska Hargitay, Tim Gunn, Jemima Kirke and Mary J Blige are among the famous faces featured in No More’s video campaign, which is appropriately titled 'Speechless' and launched December 10.

In one of the 30-second clips, Ms Swank appears with bloodshot eyes and appears to be struggling to gain composure as the words 'Domestic violence and sexual assault are hard subjects for everyone to talk about' appear onscreen.

And Girls actress Jemima Kirke takes a moment to wipe away tears before announcing: 'I'm good'.

No More, an organization formed to combat domestic violence and sexual assault, used outtakes from its previous 'Anthem' campaign to produce the unscripted spots, working with creative agency Young & Rubicam and non-profit the Joyful Heart Foundation, whose founder Ms Hargitay directed the ads.

Rachel Howald, a chief creative officer at Young & Rubicam, told AdAge that the idea for the Speechless series came from the emotional response from various celebrities and sports stars who participated in the original campaign.

'The very first person on the very first shoot day had a completely emotional response, and then that just continued,' she said.

'As I was watching this happen, I called the editor and asked can we cut these together ... because I thought there was something really powerful there.'

More than 80 celebrities participated in No More's Anthem campaign, shot in 2013, which saw stars including Courteney Cox, Amy Poehler and Ice-T condemning common excuses given by victims of domestic violence.

No More has already rolled out 20 of the Speechless videos, which also feature appearances from Mary J Blige, Megan Hilty, Christopher Meloni, Blair Underwood and NFL stars such as Cris Carter.

Ms Hargitay told ABC News: There was no one who didn't have a particular line resonate so deeply that they had to take a moment to gather themselves.'
