Fighting resumed in Ukraine today after Kiev president Petro Poroshenko refused to extend the shaky ten-day ceasefire in the conflict with separatist rebels and vowed 'We will attack'.

At the same time, Vladimir Putin claimed he could not dictate to the pro-Moscow insurgents to lay down their arms, with his spokesman declaring: 'Russia's influence on the militia should not be overestimated.'

A new phase in the conflict began with the new get-tough message from recently-elected Mr Poroshenko, who defied Mr Putin and told Ukrainians in a late night TV announcement: 'After examining the situation I have decided, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, not to extend the unilateral ceasefire.'

Despite lengthy talks on a fresh truce in a teleconference with Putin yesterday - brokered by the leaders of France and Germany - the Kiev president vowed to rout the pro-Moscow rebels.

'We will attack, and we will free our country,' he said.

'The decision not to continue the ceasefire is our answer to terrorists, militants and marauders.'

Vladimir Putin blasted the West as Ukraine's fighter bombers and tanks launched a ferocious onslaught.

A bitter Kremlin leader accused Kiev's president of going to 'war' against his own people after ending a tense ten-day ceasefire.  

In an ominous move, Putin last night summoned his powerful Security Council of military and intelligence chiefs to discuss what his spokesman called the 'rapidly deteriorating' crisis on his borders.

There were unconfirmed reports of heavy casualties among rebel fighters in assaults by Ukrainian forces.  

One account based on sources in the 25th Dnipropetrovsk airborne brigade claimed as many as 250 fighters - two thirds of them Chechens - were killed on Tuesday, said reports in the Ukrainian media.  

Separatist sources denied the claims as 'ridiculous'.  

As Putin held talks with his security chiefs, he warned the West he would protect Russians and those speaking his language. 

'I want everyone to understand that our country will in  future stand for the rights of our compatriots abroad as energetically as now, using all OUR arsenal of powers, from political and economic to humanitarian operations and the right for self defence allowed by international law,' he said.  

Putin said the West should have expected a hostile reaction from him to the take over of power by pro-Western forces ousting president Viktor Yanukovych. 

'Of course we had no right to leave people of Crimea and Sevastopol to the mercy of militant nationalists and radicals, we could not allow to have our access to the Black sea significantly restricted and to have NATO troops stepping - and quite quickly - on Crimean soil and into Sevastopol.'

He claimed: 'Practically everything Russians fought for since the times of Peter the Great, or even from before - historians know better - would have been overruled.'

Moscow reacted with dismay to the ending of the ceasefire. 

Sergei Naryshkin, speaker of the Russian parliament, said: 'Without a truce, without the start of dialogue, it is simply impossible to restore peace, justice and law and order in Ukraine.'

And Mr Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told newspaper Kommersant today that that despite Western demands there was a limit to how much Moscow could do.

'Russia is not a party to the confrontation, it is an internal Ukrainian conflict,' he said.

'And Moscow cannot tell self-defence forces what to do and how to do it. It can appeal to self-defence forces and use its existing influence.'

The US and EU have threatened a new round of tougher sanctions on Russia, blaming Moscow for failing to put pressure on the rebels.
