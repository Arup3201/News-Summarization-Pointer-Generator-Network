A cat owner spent six days in hospital with blood poisoning after her Persian pet sank its claws into her elbow when she tried to give it a bath.

Lesley Pleasant, 57, was trying to get rid of Oscar's fleas when the 10-month-old Persian cat 'flew' up her arm before digging its sharp nails into her artery.

Oscar was so scared that it took Mrs Pleasant's 16-year-old daughter Alisha 30 seconds to remove its claws from her arm after the attack at their house in Shepton Mallet, Somerset.

Just hours later the mother-of-one's arm had ballooned to twice its size and she began to feel so ill she could not get out of bed.

The PE teacher and gymnastics coach was rushed to hospital where staff quickly diagnosed septicaemia, or blood poisoning.

If not treated promptly, septic shock can develop, causing organ failure and death in some patients.

'He doesn't like to be groomed, so I decided I'd try to give him a bath first - I have another Persian, and a dog, and they are both fine with being bathed, but Oscar really wasn't,' said Mrs Pleasant.

'He flew up my arm, and my daughter had to ease his claws out of my skin.

'I was covered in scratches, but one, on the inside of my elbow was really deep. It hurt like anything, but it didn't bleed, so I just got on with my day.

'I've never felt like that before,' she added. 'I had this terrible headache, and I couldn't move my arm.'

Mrs Pleasant started to feel ill just hours after the attack and began suffering from a high temperature, headache and stiff arm.

By 2am, she was feeling worse, and by 3am she could not get out of bed.

'About 5am, I used my mobile phone to call my daughter, who sleeps in the room next to me,' she said.

'If I had any sense, I would have gone and got treatment right after the scratch.

'My arm had swollen up and looked like one of those long, sausage balloons you get.

'Once the paracetamol started to work, I felt well enough to drive myself to hospital - except that the hospital was closed.

'So I had to go back home and wait a few more hours for it to open.'

Staff quickly saw the ill mother and she was transferred to nearby Bath Royal United Hospital where she was whisked through to a ward.

'I threw up in the car all the way there. When I arrived in A&E, they whisked me through straight away, got me into a bed and put me on a drip,' said Mrs Pleasant.

The drip which should have helped, instead brought her out in a rash, and three days later, doctors established she had a penicillin allergy.

After a change of medication and six days in hospital she was allowed to go home.

'From now on, my cats are having their flea treatments by injection - it's so much easier,' she said.

Septicaemia is a life-threatening condition where bacteria invade the bloodstream.

It is usually triggered by an infection in another part of the body, such as pneumonia, meningitis, bladder infections or even a tooth abscess.

The bacteria escape from this initial infection and enter the blood, causing a series of reactions that can lead to swelling of the blood vessels and blood clots.

The condition can occur after a miscarriage if any foetal tissue left inside the body becomes infected.

There are about 300,000 cases a year and up to 15,000 deaths.

If untreated, it develops into septic shock, where blood pressure drops and organs fail.
