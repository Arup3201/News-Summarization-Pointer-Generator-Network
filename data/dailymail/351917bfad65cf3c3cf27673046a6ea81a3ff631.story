Nigella Lawson spoke publicly for the first time yesterday about her ‘mortifying’ court ordeal, saying her only desire as she gave evidence was to protect her children.

The celebrity cook said she didn’t want to dwell on the experience, instead joking: ‘And actually, since then I’ve eaten a lot of chocolate, had a very good Christmas and I’m into the New Year.’

Miss Lawson made the comments on US TV show Good Morning America, where she was being interviewed to promote her cookery show The Taste.

First interview: Nigella Lawson has appeared on GMA and admitted she'd been 'eating a lot of chocolate' to cope with the trials of the past year including drug allegations and her divorce

Admission: Nigella told the TV morning show in New York on Thursday that she was 'mortified' by the playing out of her private life in court

The 53-year-old was immediately asked 
about the trial of her two former housekeepers, during which intimate 
details of her alleged secret drug abuse, disastrous marriage to 
multi-millionaire Charles Saatchi and chaotic lifestyle were exposed.

She
 said: ‘To be honest, to have not only your private life but 
distortions of your private life put on display is mortifying, but 
there are people going through an awful lot worse and to dwell on any of
 it would be self-pity, and I don’t like to do that.’

Asked
 about her memories of the two days she spent in the witness box, she 
said: ‘I can’t really remember exactly because you’re so focused on 
answering the questions to the best of your ability that actually you 
don’t have enormous awareness of yourself ... maybe that’s a good thing.

‘My
 only desire really was to protect my children as much as possible, 
which I wasn’t, alas, always … I couldn’t do, but that’s what I wanted 
to do.’

Asked whether she 
felt she was on trial, Miss Lawson said: ‘Well, I did. It’s one of the 
niceties of the English legal system that you are not allowed counsel if
 you are a witness. Maybe it will change. Maybe that’s good.’

Miss
 Lawson, dressed in a black dress and heels, appeared confident during 
her appearance on the breakfast show for the ABC network but at one 
point fumbled her words.

She
 was interviewed alongside fellow judges Anthony Bourdain, Marcus 
Samuelsson and Ludo Lefebvre ahead of the second series of US show The 
Taste. It was only when she began talking about the lemon meringue pie 
she had baked that she seemed to relax.

She
 was not asked directly about her alleged drug use or her former 
personal assistants, Italian sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo, 
who were cleared of a £685,000 credit card fraud.

During
 two days of humiliating evidence at Isleworth Crown Court last month, 
Miss Lawson was forced to deny she was a drug addict after confessing to
 having snorted cocaine and smoked cannabis.

Moving on: Nigella said she had enjoyed a good Christmas on her first TV appearance since the fraud trial of the Grillo sisters, who were eventually found not guilty of fraud

Her
 former housekeepers told the court she had let them spend what they 
liked in return for keeping her cocaine addiction and heavy cannabis use
 a secret from her ‘shouty’ and frightening husband.

After the Grillos 
were acquitted, Miss Lawson released an extraordinary statement in which
 she described the allegations of her drug-taking as a ‘ridiculous 
sideshow’.

She claimed the 
trial had been part of a campaign by her 70-year-old ex-husband to 
‘destroy her’ with malicious and false allegations.

She
 also complained that her children were subjected to ‘extreme 
allegations in court without any real protection,’ something for which 
she could not ‘forgive the court process’.

Miss
 Lawson has long wanted to find fame in America, but the allegations of 
drug use during last month’s court case could put those ambitions on 
hold.

Scotland Yard is to 
investigate the cook over her admission that she took cocaine and smoked
 cannabis in front of her children. Officers will review the evidence 
and then consult the Crown Prosecution Service.

She
 could face the prospect of being formally interviewed by police. The 
first series of The Taste, which involves contestants presenting their 
food to the judges over several rounds, will be aired on Channel 4 from 
January 7.

Divorce: Mr Saatchi (right) said he was 'heartbroken' to have lost Nigella (left) - but she did not reciprocate and made clear she was happy to move on with her life

In charge: Nigella, pictured alongside her fellow chefs Ludo Lefebrve, Marcus Samuelsson and Anthony Bourdain is both a judge and the show's executive producer

Break: Nigella was with her best friend over Christmas before heading to the United States to promote her new show

Meanwhile it 
emerged yesterday that Mr Saatchi spent New Year’s Eve on a £25million 
super yacht in the Caribbean with his new girlfriend Trinny Woodall.

He
 reportedly spent tens of thousands of pounds to hire the 160ft long 
vessel, on which he and  Miss Woodall were ‘acting like honeymooners’.

One of Miss Lawson’s fellow judges on The Taste, chef Anthony Bourdain,
 is a reformed drug addict who once sold his record collection to buy 
heroin.

Bourdain, 57, wrote a
 bestselling memoir of his days as a chef in New York in the 1990s, 
describing how ‘we were high all the time, sneaking off to the walk-in 
[refrigerator] at every opportunity. Hardly a decision was made without 
drugs’.

Testimony: Nigella is questioned by 
Karina Arden, defending, as sisters Elisabetta and Francesca Grillo 
watch from the dock where she said she had taken cocaine seven times

Not guilty: The TV cook accused her ex-husband of a campaign 'deliberately designed to destroy my reputation' as former aides Elisabetta Grillo (left) and Francesca Grillo (right) were cleared of a £680,000 credit card fraud

Harrowing: A furious Nigella said after the trial ended her children had been 'subjected to extreme allegations in court without any real protection or representation', adding: 'For this I cannot forgive the court process'

Close: Since his divorce Charles Saatchi has spent long periods with Trinny Woodall and was in America and the Caribbean with her over Christmas and the New Year

Luxury life: Ms Woodall posted this photo of herself hugging her daughter on the super-yacht she is shared with Mr Saatchi as they saw in 2014 together
