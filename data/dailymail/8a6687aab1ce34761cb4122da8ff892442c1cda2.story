300,000lbs of possibly contaminated food may have ended up in school lunchrooms across the US, the company behind the products has said.

At least one US school district has already warned parents that their children may have been fed E.coli contaminated food.

Ten million lbs of frozen food has been recalled by Rich Products Corp. in the past two weeks after 27 cases of E.coli illnesses, spread across 15 states, have been linked to their products.

Danger: Around 300,000 of the ten million lbs products withdrawn, which includes Farm Rich mini pizzas, have been distributed to US schools cafeterias

Rich Products, based in Buffalo, N.Y., estimates that about three million lbs may still be on the market, in stores, homes and in schools.

Harford County schools, Maryland told parents they had been notified last week that the pepperoni pizzatas served in school cafeterias across the district had been recalled, some of which have already been served.

Dwight Gram of Rich Products said the main items shipped to schools were labelled as pizza dippers and pepperoni pizzatas of the Farm Rich brand.

Mr Gram added that the food served in schools may be safer than that which has been purchased by individuals as the items are more likely to be thoroughly cooked, killing the E.coli bacteria.

The particular strain of E.coli linked to the Farm Rich brand products is so rare some laboratories are still unable to identify it.

Warning: Farm Rich pizza dippers contaminated with E.Coli may have been served to children across the US after frozen foods from Rich Products' Georgia plant were found to carry the bacteria

Contaminated: Rich Products Corp. have been forced to recall some of their products after 27 cases of E.coli illnesses - spread across 15 states - were linked to their frozen food

As a result many illnesses may not have been identified, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.

Two Farm Rich brand products have been directly linked the outbreak strain,
a type of frozen mini pizza slices and frozen chicken quesadillas, 
after samples of the strain of E. coli were collected from products 
found in the Texas and New York homes of two victims.

According
to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 81 per cent 
of the people who fell ill were under the age of 21, but it is not yet 
clear whether any illnesses are linked to foods shipped to schools.

Nine people were hospitalized and two have developed haemolytic uremic syndrome, a type of kidney failure that can have lasting effects.

Rich Products two weeks ago announced a voluntary recall of certain Farm Rich and Market Day brand products because of the possible E. coli contamination.

Last week, the company expanded the recall to include everything made at its plant in Waycross, Georgia, a full ten million lbs of frozen food products.

Products manufactured at other plants have not been affected.

An E. coli infection can cause mild diarrhoea or more severe complications, including kidney damage.
