Tom Daley believes any footballer would be surprised by the support they would receive if they chose to reveal that they were homosexual.

The 20-year-old diver, who last December announced on YouTube he was in a relationship with Hollywood screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, does not believe any public figure should have to discuss their sexuality.

Yet Daley, an Olympic bronze medalist at London 2012, thinks football would accept an openly-gay player despite no active player making their sexuality known for fear of being the subject of prejudice and target of abuse.

Tom Daley said footballers would be surprised by the support they would likely receive if they came out

'I think people would be surprised how supported they'd be if they were to come out in a football environment,' Daley said at the Leaders in Sport conference in London.

'(But) you don't have to do a YouTube video and announce that you're straight. It shouldn't be anyone's business.

'You should just be able to live your life the way you want to live it.

'It comes down to each individual person. At the time I individually felt ready, I did it. Everyone's been really supportive.'

Daley has no worries with travelling to Kazan for next year's Aquatics World Championships, despite Russia's anti-gay legislation.

He has no plans to make any political statement similar to ones made during this year's Winter Olympics in Sochi.

'I have no concerns whatsoever about going to Russia,' he added.

'I've been there five, six times before and never had any problems.

'You go there to dive, you don't go there thinking about doing anything other than that.

'For me, I wouldn't go there thinking 'oh, I'm going to do this' or 'I have to do this'. I just go there and focus on my performance.'

Daley's YouTube revelation was discussed with his sponsors prior to being posted on the internet and allowed him to control what was said.

He added: 'There were so many different opinions of what I should do, how I should do it. A TV interview, a press interview, all those different ideas.

'YouTube just felt natural. I was able to say everything I wanted to say without being asked any extra questions.'

Daley won both a gold and silver medal at the latest Commonwealth games in Glasgow

Asked if it had affected his numerous endorsements, Daley, star of TV's Splash!, added: 'I don't think it's massively changed anything (commercially). If anything it's been positive.

'It was a life decision to make. It wasn't a business decision.

'I did it because I felt like it was something I wanted to do and felt natural at the time to do.

'We spoke to all our sponsorship partners before the video went out.

'Everyone has been so supportive. I couldn't have asked for it to go any better. I was very happy with the way it went.'
