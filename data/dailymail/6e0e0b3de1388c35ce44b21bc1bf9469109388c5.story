Judge Martin Joy, sitting at Maidstone Crown Court, in Kent, had three of his sentences increased following complaints they were too lenient

A judge who handed out unduly short sentences three times in a single year was yesterday branded ‘Britain’s softest’.

The prison terms handed down by Judge Martin Joy to two child rapists and a drug dealer were deemed too lenient by the Court of Appeal and were increased by as much as five years.

He was the only judge in England and Wales to have more than one sentence altered by the Attorney General in 2012, official figures revealed.

The statistics also showed that record numbers of cases are attracting complaints about ‘unduly lenient’ sentences.

A total of 435 cases were referred to the Attorney General last year, compared with 377 in 2011 and 342 in 2010.

Cases may be highlighted by victims or their relatives, the Crown Prosecution Service or members of the public.

They are sent to the Court of Appeal if it is thought the judge got it seriously wrong.

In November last year Judge Joy, 65, who sits at Maidstone Crown Court, sentenced a 36-year-old child rapist to ten years in jail on three counts of rape, three of indecent assault and one other indecency charge against a six-year-old girl.

The man had a previous conviction for indecent assault against a girl of eight.

The court heard his victim was ‘severely traumatised’. He denied the charges, forcing the child to give evidence.

The Appeal Court increased the jail term to 15 years.

Judge Robert Juckes QC (left), at Worcester Crown Court, and Judge Daniel Pearce-Higgins QC (right), at Hereford Crown Court, both had two separate referrals each

Earlier this month, the Attorney General received complaints about the 15-month jail sentence handed to presenter Stuart Hall for a series of sex attacks, and his term is to be considered for referral to the Court of Appeal

Attorney General Dominic Grieve QC said he was pleased a record number of offenders were referred as possibly unduly lenient and said he had no concerns about any particular judges

In a separate case, Judge Joy sentenced a 69-year-old serial sex offender to ten years for repeated sexual abuse of a nine-year-old girl.

The Appeal Court imposed an indefinite sentence for public protection with a minimum term of seven years, the equivalent of a 14-year jail term.

The third sentence was given to Henrik Vriezen, who was caught importing a class-B drug known as 4-MEC, cannabis and amphetamine worth more than £3million.

He was jailed for three years and six months, but this was increased on appeal to six years.

Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention, said: ‘Martin Joy wins the title  of Britain’s softest judge, and the Court of Appeal was absolutely right to toughen up his soft punishments.

‘When passing down punishments, judges should always bear in mind how often criminals serve only a fraction of their sentences.’

Of the cases complained about, 82 were heard by the Court of Appeal and 62 offenders had their sentence increased.

The Attorney General, Dominic Grieve QC, said there were ‘not particular judges’ he was concerned about.

‘It may just be that all judges at various times get a reference made in respect of their work and it may be purely coincidental that it’s happened more than once to a judge in a particular year,’ he said.
