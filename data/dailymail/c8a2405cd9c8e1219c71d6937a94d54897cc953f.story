Colombia striker Jackson Martinez took the World Cup by the scruff of the neck last night with two brilliantly executed goals in his side's win over Japan.

Fans of Portuguese giants Porto have become accustomed to such excellence and here Sportsmail give you the lowdown on the Colombian's super striker.

Looking up: Colombian striker Jackson Martinez has excelled at this World Cup for the South Americans

I'm sure I've heard his name before?

Definitely, if you haven't then you've been living under a rock for the past couple of years.

Martinez has been prolific in the Portuguese Primeira Liga for Porto, scoring 60 goals in 89 starts for the club since arriving from Mexican club Chiapas.

Prolific: Martinez has scored 60 goals in 89 appearances for Porto since arriving from Mexican side Chiapas

So is he just a two season wonder?

Most certainly not.

He carved himself a burgeoning reputation in South America, first with Colombian side Medellin before moving to Chiapas where he spent three seasons scoring 36 goals which alerted Porto to his talents.

So how did his move to Porto come about?

Then Porto manager Vitor Pereira had seen enough to splash out £6.5million on Martinez - quite a sum for a player who was largely unknown in European football during the time.

But Pereira's faith paid instant dividends as the Colombian scored on his debut as Porto beat Academica in the Supertaca 2012. And Martinez hasn't stopped scoring since.

His performances during his first season in Portugal earned him the nickname 'Jackshow Martinez'.

Surely Porto will struggle to keep him?

It will be difficult, yes. Europe's big guns are circling round the striker after his glowing performances. Arsenal were interested in January and continue to monitor his progress. But Arsene Wenger isn't the only interested party. Atletico Madrid have identified Martinez as a potential replacement for Chelsea-bound Diego Costa. Chelsea and Manchester United have also been linked with moves for the 27-year-old.

How much will he cost?

He has a £33.2m release clause.

Well shouldn't a move for him for Martinez be straight forward then?

In essence, yes. But the size of the release clause is the main stumbling block, it certainly was with Arsenal last season. While his goalscoring record in Portugal isn't to be sniffed it, the fear is whether he would be able to carry that form into the Barclays Premier League. And at £33.2m, that's a big gamble to take.

Finish: Martinez grabs Colombia's second in the 3-0 win over Japan and is much sought after

Could Arsenal renew their interest this summer?

His two goals against Japan on Tuesday night won't have been missed by Wenger, who is in Brazil working for French TV. With Karim Benzema set to sign a new deal at Real Madrid and complexities over Arsenal's interest in Mario Balotelli, Martinez could yet find himself at the Emirates Stadium next season.

Interested: Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger is an admirer of Martinez but may not meet the asking price

Pricey: Although he is much sought-after, Martinez's £33.2m buyout clause may put off suitors
