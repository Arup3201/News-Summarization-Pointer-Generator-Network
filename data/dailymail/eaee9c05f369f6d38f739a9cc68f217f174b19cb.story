Taken down: Customers had complained that the J.C. Penny kettle on a billboard near the 405 Interstate looked like Hitler

J.C. Penney will be hoping that the embarrassing furore surrounding its tea kettle that bears a striking resemblance to Adolf Hitler will blow over now it has removed a billboard advertising the product and removed the item from its website.

The billboard near the 405 freeway in Culver City, California was taken down Wednesday.

After a string of customers 
complained the Michael Graves Stainless Steel Tea Kettle resembled the 
World War II dictator, the retailer was forced to deny any intentional 
link.

On Tuesday the company made it clear 
that any resemblance was completely 'unintentional'.

'If we had designed it to look like 
something, we would have gone with a snowman or something fun,' the 
store tweeted.

The $40 product was also taken down from the company's website as of Thursday.

The item had already sold-out after becoming an internet sensation and several have already shown up on eBay, where sellers have listed them for as much as $160, reports Today.

Commuters driving along the route near 
Culver City found themselves instantly reminded of the Nazi leader Adolf
 Hitler when looking up at one of the 31 kettles previously for sale in store.

Several motorists took pictures of the sign, which is around 10 foot tall and 36 foot wide, and posted it on Twitter along with their views about the kettle's resemblance to the former dictator.

Some took to Twitter to complain of the similarity between the stainless steel tea kettle and the Nazi dictator

Jim @scplanetable tweeted: Every time
 I see that JC Penny billboard with the teapot, I keep seeing Hitler. 
Seriously, the thing looks exactly like Hitler. 405 S, man.'

Proving
 the billboard may not be the best advertising for the retailer, another
 commuter, Benari @benarilee tweeted: 'Uh, no thanks, JC Penny. I don't 
think I want your HITLER teapot.'

Other social media users added that they dreaded to think what the store's pressure cookers must look like.

Architect and designer Michael Graves holds a bathtub handle he designed to help the handicapped and elderly

Born in 1934, American architect Graves was known first for his contemporary building designs and some prominent public commissions.

In recent years he has become better known for designing domestic products, first sold at Target and since 2010 exclusively through J.C. Penney.

He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana and earned a master's degree in architecture from Harvard University.

He directs the firm Michael Graves & Associates, which has offices in Princeton and in New York City.

Graves and his firm have earned critical acclaim for a wide variety of commercial and residential buildings and interior design, although some occupants of the buildings object to the confined views caused by signature features such as small or circular windows and squat columns.

He is also a Senior Fellow of the Design Futures Council.

In 2003, an infection of unknown origin (possibly bacterial meningitis) left Graves paralyzed from the waist down.
