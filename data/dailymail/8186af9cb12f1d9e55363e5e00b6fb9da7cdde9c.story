MasterChef star Gregg Wallace today revealed how he was abused by his babysitter's husband when he was eight years old.

In a candid new autobiography, the food critic said the man, who was in his 60s, kissed him on the mouth after telling him he would 'show you what happens when you get a girlfriend'.

He told how he clearly remembers his 'hot, stinking, tobacco breath' before adding: 'I turned to jelly, in a state of total confusion.'

The 48-year-old said he fell victim to the man, called George, while he was living in Peckham, south London.

In his book Life On A Plate, he writes: 'While my babysitter Bernie seemed a kindly woman, her husband, George, was often there too, a tall scrawny man in his 60s, who chained-smoked roll-ups.'

A few days after the kissing incident, he said George tried to get Mr Wallace to come for 'a lie down' in his bedroom, but he refused.

The former greengrocer went on to explain why he never felt able to speak out about his horrific experiences until now.

He said: 'I never did tell mum, or 
anyone else. I didn't really understand what had happened and somehow I 
knew he (George) would also be in really big trouble.

'I didn't, until I got older, consider myself a victim. Instead, I felt ashamed, as if I was complicit.'

Mr Wallace, who has a 15-year-old daughter Libby and a son Tom, 18, later told The Sun that he was encouraged to finally shed light on the abuse by his ex-wife Heidi.

He also revealed how he was 'scared of marrying again' after splitting from third wife Heidi, 30, in March after just 14 months of wedlock.

Soon after the break-up, he had been 
openly telling diners at his Wallace and Co restaurant in Putney, South 
West London, how much he stills loved her.

Mr Wallace, who had been separated from his second wife Denise for eight years when he met Heidi, told the Daily Mail at the time: 
‘I’ve had a terrible week.

'It’s all over Twitter. I’m in bits, I love my
wife. I don’t know what’s gone wrong. She’s an amazing woman.

‘It’s all gone mad. It went wrong about three months ago. We knew there was something wrong. We want different things.

'We
both have images of each other, I don’t know if they were right. I had 
an image of her and she had one of me but whether they were right...'

He insisted that the age gap – at 30, Heidi is 17 years his junior – was not a factor in the split.

He has now opened his heart on his 
blossoming romance with his new girlfriend, 27-year-old ex-glamour model
Cara Franco, and told how his children teased him about his love of her
'great boobs'.

After meeting the TV star at the Ideal Home Show in June, the brunette posted a photo of her with him on her Twitter account with the caption:' @GreggAWallace Thought i would follow you be rude not to.'

The pair were then spotted holding hands in public when they attended the BBC Good Food Show together later that month.
