Hurricane
Sandy may have seemed uniquely damaging to those caught in its path, but some
have suggested that global warming could bring even more devastating storms to
the U.S. in coming years.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo and mayor Michael Bloomberg both pointed to
climate change as the culprit for Sandy's ravages as they addressed the scale
of the destruction on Tuesday morning.

And Cuomo even raised the possibility of a levee being built in New York
Harbor, an unprecedented move to protect the 400-year-old city.

Many observers have pointed out that it is almost impossible to pinpoint
climate change as the cause of specific weather events.

Moreover, the U.S. has long been subject to hurricanes and other damaging
storms which have been just as violent as Sandy.

But the terrors wrought by Sandy, combined with last year's destructive
Hurricane Irene, have led New York's top officials to raise the spectre of
global warming.

At a press conference in Manhattan on Tuesday, Cuomo said he had told President
Obama that 'we have a 100-year flood every two years now'.

He added: 'There has been a series of extreme weather incidents. That is not a
political statement. That is a factual statement.

'Anyone who says there's not a dramatic change in weather patterns, I think is
denying reality.'

Bloomberg echoed the sentiment, saying: 'What is clear is that the storms we've
experienced in the last year or so around this country and around the world are
much more severe than before.

'Whether that's global warming or what, I don't know, but we'll have to address
those issues.'

When the governor was asked if officials were contemplating building a levee in
the city's harbour, he replied: 'It is something we're going to have to start
thinking about.

'The construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations. We
are only a few feet above sea level.'Â 

Since New York City's foundation in the early 17th century, the lower tip of
Manhattan has been at the heart of metropolitan life - despite its
vulnerability to flooding from the harbour.

Al Gore predictably joined the climate-change chorus on Tuesday, describing the
hurricane as 'a disturbing sign of things to come' in a post on his blog.

'We must heed this warning and act quickly to solve the climate crisis,' the
former Vice President added.

Two possible links between global warming and the damage wrought by Sandy are
the raised sea levels which make it easier for the coast to flood, and warm air
in the Atlantic Ocean increasing the fierceness of the storm.

However, many experts have denied that climate change was behind Hurricane
Sandy - Houston Chronicle science reporter Eric Bergen wrote that the
connection was 'a stretch that is just not supported by science at this time.'

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has previously said that there is
little evidence global warming worsens tropical storms and hurricanes.
