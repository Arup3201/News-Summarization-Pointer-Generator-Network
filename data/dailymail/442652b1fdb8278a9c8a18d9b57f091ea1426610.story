The daughter of a Sandy Hook hero has opened up about the prominent role her deceased mother played in her summer wedding, down to choosing the dress she wore.

Erica Lafferty, one of Sandy Hook principle Dawn Hochsprung daughters, spoke in her first televised interview since marrying July 6 in an emotional day dedicated to her mother.

The still-grieving daughter Monday evening told CNN's Piers Morgan the ceremony went exactly the way that her mother wanted it.

'Exactly the way she wanted': Erica Lafferty says her wedding went exactly as she and her mother planned it

'I got married in the dress that my mom 
and I picked out, at her house in the Adirondacks, in the shoes that she
would have tormented me for wearing,' she said with a grin.

'We had almost the entire wedding planned together and I did it exactly the way that she wanted it to be,' Ms Lafferty continued.

Ms Lafferty was married to long-time fiance Christopher Smegielski only seven months after the horrific Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting spree that claimed her mother's life.

"I knew that day would have been perfect for her, it was perfect for me,' Ms Lafferty explained. 'It was perfect for my husband. And I knew she was with me.'

'She lets me know it's worth it': Ms Lafferty also explained that every time she feels like giving up the gun control fight, her mother reminds her to keep at it

Ms Lafferty, who has become a staunch gun control advocate in the year since deranged gunman Adam Lanza killed 28 people, including 20 first-grade students, his own mother and Ms Hochsprung, also revealed her emotions during the her visit to her mother's grave.

'I was able to go to the cemetery to be with her that morning,' she said, 'only for a couple minutes because I knew I had to get out quick so I didn't completely lose it and ruin my day.'

'I think it's exactly the day she would have wanted me to have.'

She also spoke of how she believes her mother finds ways to inspire her when she feels like no longer fighting for stronger gun controls as the one-year anniversary of the mass shooting approaches.

'Every time I'm ready to give up, a school bus will drive by, or I'll be standing outside... and my wind chimes will go off,' Ms Lafferty told Mr Morgan.

'I'll see a butterfly in the blistering cold, or Harriet the spy will fall off my bookshelf, she lets me know that it's all worth it.'

Ms Lafferty, 27, has spoken previously about the wedding, but her appearance this week on CNN's 'Piers Morgan Live' was her first televised interview since the wedding.

She made a morning stop at her
mother’s grave- wedding dress and all- to make sure the heroic woman 
had her place on the special day

‘I wanted to let her know how much I missed her,' Ms Lafferty told People Magazine.

‘No daughter should ever have to do that on her wedding day.’

Ms Lafferty posted a picture of the tender moment to her personal Twitter page, with the poignant caption: 'I love you, Mommy'.

Planning the wedding was one of the last things the two women did before the horrific December 2012 shooting that claimed Ms Hochsprung’s life, along with dozens of others.

The heroic woman is credited with saving the 
lives of countless children and teachers by confronting the gunman and 
broadcasting their interaction over the school announcement system so 
that everyone in the building could hear it and use the time to hide.

‘Never in a million years did I think I would be getting married without my mother there. Planning for my wedding was actually one of the last things my mom and I did together before she was killed,’ Ms Lafferty told the magazine.

Ms Lafferty and longtime fiance Christopher Smegielski were married at Ms Hochsprung’s upstate New York lake house in the Adirondacks.

As a tribute to her mother, Ms Lafferty wore custom sneakers as part of her bridal ensemble.

‘My mom always teased me because I was such a tomboy," she told People.

‘When I was picking out my dress, we found you could custom Converse sneakers, so she knew I had ordered them.’

The recently-married Ms Lafferty also shared that she finds a way to keep her mother part of every single day. Just days before the wedding, she posted a picture of a sign she left at her mother’s grave.

Mr Smegielski stood by Ms Lafferty during a number of interviews immediately following the December 14 tragedy.

In a segment for The Today Show, he said: 'For some reason Dawn loved me and it's my job now to be there for her daughter'.

'I accept that job with open arms and I'll be there for her in any way possible,' he said.

Ms Lafferty added that she was finding it 'tough' after her mother's death.

'I had a really hard time not being mad about it but that's who she was,' she said. 'She faced every single problem that she ever had in her life head on.

'My cousin referred to her as a 'bull' yesterday. There's no stopping Dawn when she has a mission. She gets it done and she gives it everything she has.'

Ms Lafferty is now a gun control advocate, working with Mayors Against Illegal Guns ‘to fight common-sense gun laws and join with others who've lost loved ones.’
