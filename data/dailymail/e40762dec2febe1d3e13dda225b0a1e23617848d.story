Over a third of women worldwide will experience physical or sexual violence, a new study has revealed.

Research found 35 per cent of women across the globe will be the victim of either intimate or non-partner violence.

And intimate partner violence is the most common type of assault against females, affecting 30 per cent of all women.

Experts say that urgent action is needed to address the global problems of violence against women. Violence can lead to misuse of alcohol amongst women, sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and abortion

As well as releasing the findings of the report, the World Health Organisation (WHO) detailed the impacts of such violence on women.

The study found health problems ranging from broken bones to pregnancy-related complications, mental problems and impaired social functioning.

Injury, and even death, are the most serious consequences of violence, but it can also double the chances of developing depression.

Meanwhile, violence can lead to misuse of alcohol amongst women, sexually transmitted infections and unwanted pregnancies and abortion.

The study found too that women who experience partner violence have a 16 per cent greater chance of giving birth to a low-weight baby.

Disturbing: 'Significant others' are responsible for between a third and a half of all female murders, compared to just one in 16 male killings

What's more, the research showed the need for all sectors to help eliminate tolerance for violence against women and provide better support for women.

The study was done in partnership with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the South African Medical Research Council.

Professor Charlotte Watts, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: 'This new data shows violence against women is extremely common.

'We urgently need to invest in prevention to address the underlying causes of this global women's health problem.'

According to the research, a fear of stigma prevents many women from reporting non-partner sexual violence.

Though the review also found that 7.2 per cent of women globally had reported non-partner sexual violence.

Dr Margaret Chan, from WHO, said: 'These findings send a powerful message that violence against women is a global health problem of epidemic proportions.

'We also see that the world's health systems can and must do more for women who experience violence.'

And Dr Claudia Garcia-Moreno, from WHO, added: 'The report findings show violence greatly increases women's vulnerability to a range of short and long-term health problems.

'It highlights the need for the health sector to take violence against women more seriously.'
