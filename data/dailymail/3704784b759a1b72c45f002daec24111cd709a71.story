She's been dating James Middleton for a year now so things must be pretty serious between them. And should James decide to put a ring on girlfriend Donna Air's finger, we know just the place to get something absolutely to her taste. QVC.

The 34-year-old TV presenter and socialite has designed a delicate new range of jewellery for the shopping channel.

The mother of one showcases her natural beauty in the new campaign imagery for her range of accessories, named Little Bird.

Donna the designer: Miss Air has designed and modelled her new range of jewellery for QVC, which will launch on April 29

Speaking to MailOnline about the new collection, which is priced between £49-£250, Donna said: 'I am quite excited about this and so pleased with the results. Designing a jewellery range is something I've always wanted to do.'

The mother-of-one's intricate new collection of stacking rings and necklaces, which lands on QVC on April 29, is heavily inspired by nature.

'It's designed for busy women who don't have much head space and are always in a hurry,' explained Donna.

'It's easy to wear and can be worn with any outfit from day to night, it works for all occasions. I think women will really get it.'

Donna, who designed the range from scratch, has incorporated on-trend stacking rings and more elaborate precious stones into her range, which she says reflects her own style.

Donna, who names Kylie Minogue, Cate Blanchett and Helena Christensen her fashion icons, said: 'My look is relaxed and while I love fashion, I don't obsess about it.

'I don't have set rules when it comes to dressing and I don't mind where my clothes are from.'

The Geordie, who stays in shape by swimming, running and practicing yoga, loves a natural approach when it comes to beauty and her make-up bag made up of just a Charlotte Tilbury blusher, Laura Mercier concealer and a Rimmel eyebrow pencil.

While they hadn't been seen together since January, Donna and James Middleton put rumours of a split behind them once 
and for all at the start of the month as they enjoyed a romantic evening together.

The pair were seen 
leaving the trendy Chiltern Firehouse restaurant in good spirits, the same night Kate Moss, Jamie Hince and Lily Allen were also photographed there.

Speaking about her plans for the future, she said: 'There's a few projects on the horizon and let's just say it's going to be a fun and busy year - but I've made sure it's all manageable.'
