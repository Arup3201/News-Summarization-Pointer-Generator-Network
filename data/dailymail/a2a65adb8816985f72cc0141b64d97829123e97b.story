Beaten to death for not reading the Bible: Roderick Arrington, seven, was covered in bruises and open wounds when he was brought unconscious to hospital in Las Vegas where he later died

Second-grader Roderick recently moved to Las Vegas from Illinois, where he had been living with his father and grandmother.

Markiece Palmer told police he had spanked the child for lying about reading a Bible verse and failing to finish his homework. He said the boy then slipped and hit his head.

The arrest report details extensive injuries, including bruising over Roderick's whole body and open wounds on his buttocks, allegedly from being beaten with a belt. The police report also revealed that Roderick was violently shaken by his stepfather.

When the little boy was unresponsive last week, Dina Palmer called her pastor who advised her to dial 911.

The couple are being held without bail at the Clark County Detention Center and are due in court today.
