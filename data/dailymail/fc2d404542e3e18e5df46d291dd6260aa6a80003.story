David Trezeguet has implored his former side Juventus to prioritise Champions League success ahead of a fourth consecutive Scudetto.

'I would put aside the fourth consecutive league title to stake everything on a European triumph,' Trezequet, 36, told Tuttosport. 'Winning the Champions League gives you the knowledge that you are the strongest out there.

'Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Barcelona will be their main rivals. They know how to perform at the business end of the tournament.

European success: David Trezeguet, 36, wants his former club to prioritise the Champions League success over a fourth successive Scudetto 

Under new management: Former AC Milan manager Massimiliano Allegri has taken the reins at Juventus 

'In Serie A, they're the favourites by far. They're a solid team, they've kept their core squad and they've strengthened. But sooner or later they'll make that leap in the Champions League, too.' 

Juve have not won the European cup since beating Ajax on penalties in 1996. 

They came runners-up in the following two seasons, losing 3-1 to Borussia Dortmund in 1997, and  1-0 to Real Madrid in 1998. 

The closest Juventus have come to European success since then came in 2003 when they lost to AC Milan on penalties at Old Trafford.

Massimiliano Allegri has been brought in to replace former manager Antonio Conte, who left the club in the summer by mutual consent and has taken over the national side. 

Allegri has a talented squad at his disposal with the likes of Carlos Tevez, Paul Pogba and Kwadwo Asamoah.

Plus, the Italian will be pleased that Juventus fended off a string of clubs who were interested in the talented Arturo Vidal over the summer.
