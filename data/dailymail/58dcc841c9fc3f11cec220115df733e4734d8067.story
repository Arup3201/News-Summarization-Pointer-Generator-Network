Looking for a change: Chris Henry had a 3D body scan that showed him what the results of liposuction would look like - and booked one

When buying a car, you take it for a test drive. When purchasing a suit, it’s usual to try it  on. I even taste grapes in Waitrose before buying a bunch.

But when  it comes to a far more life-changing decision – cosmetic surgery – the same can’t be applied.

Nose or boob-jobs, liposuction, tummy tucks – most patients undergo these operations without knowing the exact outcome.

Yes,  the surgeon will talk through the options, and show you before and after pictures of other patients. But it’s a leap in the dark. No one can predict how the body will react or how a patient will look afterwards.

So a new state-of-the-art 3D imaging programme is being heralded  as a solution since it shows patients what they’ll look like post-op.

The equipment consists of eight cameras mounted on four outstretching arms. It takes a set of high-resolution images when you stand, naked, in front of it.

The software then merges the images into a 3D template to be viewed on a computer monitor. You can view up to six simulations at one time and compare them side by side, or rotate them and view them at any angle.

It makes sense – choosing the wrong nose is rather more devastating than picking up a shirt that doesn’t fit. I should point out I’m not actually interested in surgery myself – or at least, I wasn’t.

Despite being 40 this year and no Adonis, I’ve always been pretty happy with the way I look. But in the name of journalism, I agree to have the 3D imaging process with Nottingham cosmetic surgeon Dinesh Maini. His clinic is one of a handful in the UK with the equipment.

‘This is an ideal way to give patients a realistic grasp of what they can expect from any procedure,’ he says. ‘Women, for example, come to me asking for breast implants and want big, F-size cups.

;When they see the 3D image of themselves with this size, they usually realise it’s not really what they are looking for. We can then adjust the breast size on the image to a size they can see looks correct on them.

‘The 3D image also helps me plan the procedure. I can obtain measurements and details from the software and then create a really accurate plan of how to operate.’

Dr Maini offers to show me how I can look thanks to the Axis Three software. I strip to my underwear and stand in front of the giant clam-like device. When I see my unaltered 3D image on the monitor, my jaw drops; I look hideous. Is that what people see when they look at me? I cringe as Dr Maini rotates my bulging belly 360 degrees.

We also look at my face, which displays the signs of late nights, early mornings, alcohol abuse and sunbathing. I ask to ‘try on’ some facial procedures.

With the click of a mouse, Dr Maini shows how I’d look with a Botoxed ‘brow-lift’, a reduction in my deep-set nasal labial lines with dermal filler and frown lines on  my forehead erased. I feel strange looking at this ‘airbrushed’ version of myself.

I suspect I look feminised. I’m keen to banish my pot belly; can the computer erase it? The doctor examines my midriff in the flesh, noting that ‘it looks an unusual shape’.

I can certainly ‘pinch an inch’ and he also comments that my stomach muscles are stretched and elongated rather than solid and tight. He says if I could only shift that inch, I’d have that Holy Grail of male beauty – a six-pack.

What to expect: The 3D scans can show you what you will look like after surgery - minimizing risk of unpleasant surprises

We talk about Pilates to pump up my core strength as well as the method Dr Maini uses to suck fat out from around the abs to give them definition.

It is a form of liposuction called BodyTite HD. The fat is sucked out with a tiny cannula through a small incision, then the skin is tightened with a laser.

Gym-lovers starve and dehydrate themselves to achieve this look, whereas I’m presented with the chance to have it after just three weeks of Pilates and a two-hour operation.

Dr Maini shows in 3D what would happen. I’m gobsmacked. It’s the flat stomach I used to have in my 20s.

Of course, this is merely a computer-generated picture. As Stephen Handisides, from the surgery advice website MyFaceMyBody, explains: ‘This isn’t an exact science; it’s an artistic interpretation, similar to a flattering portrait.

'Surgery is unpredictable, with potential complications. For example, high-frequency ultrasound liposuction has a risk of burns to the skin and contour irregularities – lumpy skin, to you and me. However, 3D imaging is a useful tool for giving the patient a realistic idea of what can be achieved.’

My digitally flattened stomach is definitely appealing. I would never want to be 20 again, but the prospect of getting back my abs is tempting. I’m hooked. Although no one would say I’m fat, I’m aware I’m breathing in more on the beach and that there’s no room for manoeuvre in my jeans.

What’s more amazing is that the computer also tells Dr Maini that when it flattened my stomach, it removed 300ml of fat. My mind races: 300ml is about a can of Coke’s worth – it’s nothing! ‘How difficult an operation can that be?’ I think.

Suddenly my brain makes a leap from ‘a flat stomach is a nice idea’ to ‘300ml is NOTHING – that’ll be easy – GET IT DONE! Ask for it NOW!’

Is this what Michael Jackson felt like every time he visited a cosmetic clinic? I’m ready to take the next step in a heartbeat. I book a BodyTite treatment there and then.

It’s only on the train home that  I wonder: ‘Have I just let a piece  of technology sell me an £8,000 cosmetic operation?’ Probably. But seeing really is believing.
