Norwood said the animals included  four vipers, one adder, one cobra, one cantil, one red-tailed boa, one ball python — as well as a dwarf caiman and a roughneck monitor lizard.

Investigators said that the fire broke out after an appliance caught fire in a room where the animal's were being stored.

However, the fire was minor and electrical in nature, causing about $5,000 worth of damage to the carpet. 

The owner could now face a fine of up to  $2,000 per violation for breaking city laws.
