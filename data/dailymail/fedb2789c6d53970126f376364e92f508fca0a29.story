For 13 years, quangos and public bodies were stuffed with former Labour ministers and activists.

The imposition of the party’s supporters on everything from the Food Standards Agency to the broadcast regulator Ofcom began the moment Tony Blair seized power in 1997.

Of the senior appointments made that year, an astonishing 75 per cent declared political affiliations for Labour.

The Tories were instantly marginalised, with only 13 per cent of posts.

Spree: Both former prime ministers Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, pictured together in 2004, appointed large numbers of known Labour supporters to positions of power

During every one of the New Labour years, more than half of all appointees with declared affiliations were backers of Mr Blair or Gordon Brown. On seven occasions, it was higher than 60 per cent.

Significantly, in Mr Brown’s last year, the figure hit 70 per cent - as the party prepared to put in place a ‘government in exile’ that would allow its ideological bedfellows to hold sway over public life even with a Tory prime minister in power.

The truth is that however loud Labour squeals about Michael Gove’s ejection of Sally Morgan from her role as head of schools watchdog Ofsted, it remains in control of the unofficial levers of power.

This is in part down to David Cameron’s own failure to redress the balance.

In a letter remarkable for its hypocrisy, Michael Dugher, the shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, yesterday claimed non-Tories were being weeded out and replaced with placemen who would ‘support the Government’s political agenda’.

The facts tell a very different story: Since 2010, three times more Labour supporters (312) have been appointed to powerful roles in the public sector ‘quangocracy’ than Tories (105).

In 2011/12, 77 per cent of those appointed to public bodies with declared affiliations were Labour supporters – worse even than under Mr Blair.

Last year, the numbers were more in balance, with Mr Cameron overseeing the appointment of 36 Tories and 33 Labour supporters.

But this still amounts to only 37 per cent of public posts being filled by Tories. By contrast, even John Major managed 57 per cent during his last year in office.

Here, we look at how Labour – which was spending £64billion a year on 1,162 quangos by 2010 – put its acolytes in control of almost every aspect of British public life.ELECTIONS

Left-winger: Former campaigner Jenny Watson earns £100,000 for a three-day week as head of the Electoral Commission

Jenny Watson has been head of the Electoral Commission, which regulates party donations and organises elections, since 2009.

The former left-wing campaigner earns £100,000 for a three-day week. Her partner, Andrew Puddephatt, is a former Labour leader of Hackney Council.

She was the last chair of the Equal Opportunities Commission before the creation of the Commission for Equality and Human Rights quango. In 2013, she was re-appointed to her electoral post by the Tories.FORESTSThe Forestry Commission was put into the hands of Pam Warhurst – a former Labour council leader – in one of the final acts of the Brown administration.

'Cronyism': Maggie Atkinson's appointment as Children's Commissioner in 2010 was forced through by Ed Balls

CHILDRENFormer teacher Maggie Atkinson was made Children’s Commissioner by Ed Balls in 2010 amid accusations of cronyism.

She does not have a declared political affiliation but a Commons committee rejected her appointment as they feared that she would be too obedient to the Labour government.

Mr Balls over-ruled them and she remains in post.ARTSLiz Forgan, the chair of the Scott Trust which owns the Guardian newspaper, was handed posts in charge of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Heritage Lottery Fund and, from 2009 onwards, the Arts Council England.

The ex-BBC and Channel Four executive was a vocal critic of the Coalition’s cuts to the arts budget. There were howls of protest from the left-wing establishment when her contract was not renewed last year.FOODJeff Rooker was the Labour MP for Birmingham Perry Barr from 1974 until 2001 before being given a seat in the House of Lords.

He served as an immigration minister during the years the party was presiding over an ‘open door’ policy, before being put in charge of the Food Standards Agency in 2009.

His £60,000 part-time role put him in charge of GM foods – despite being a past cheerleader for the controversial technology. Stood down last year.

New Labour adviser: Ed Richards worked for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown before being given control of Ofcom's £140million budget

£140million. Despite earning £380,000, he ran (unsuccessfully) to be the
 director general of the BBC in 2012.

however. The BBC recently appointed the former Labour Cabinet minister 
James Purnell as its £295,000-a-year ‘director, strategy and digital’.

CONSUMER RIGHTSEx-Labour general secretary and minister Lord (Larry) Whitty was made the chairman of Consumer Focus, the consumer protection watchdog, when it was established in 2007 and paid £48,000 a year for a three-day week.

The former polytechnic lecturer earned huge sums from the public purse. Her senior quango posts included Consumer Focus, Exeter NHS trust, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Food Standards Agency.

David Cameron has continued to give key jobs to Labour supporters and ministers. Examples include former Labour special adviser Simon Stevens, who is the new chief executive of the NHS; former Labour minister Alan Milburn, who is the PM’s social mobility tsar; former Labour minister Lord Hutton, who headed a commission drawing up plans to reform public sector pensions; and the left-wing economist Will Hutton, who was taken on by the Coalition to lead an independent review of fair pay in the public sector in 2010.
