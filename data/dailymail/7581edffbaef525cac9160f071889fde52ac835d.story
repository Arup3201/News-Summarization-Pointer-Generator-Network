About 9,000 U.S. Marines stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa will be moved to the U.S. territory of Guam and other locations in the Asia-Pacific, including Hawaii, under a U.S.-Japan agreement announced yesterday.

The move is part of a broader arrangement designed to ease tensions in the countries' defense alliance, which stem in part from opposition to the American presence on the island.

It also reflects a desire by the Obama administration to spread U.S. forces more widely in the Asia-Pacific region, as America rebalances its defence priorities after a decade of war in the Middle East.

Moving out: Around 9,000 U.S. Marines stationed on the Japanese island of Okinawa are to be relocated under a new U.S.-Japan agreement

The agreement was outlined in a joint statement issued last night by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and their Japanese counterparts.

Citing an 'increasingly uncertain security environment' in the Asia-Pacific region, they said their agreement was intended to maintain a robust U.S. military presence to ensure the defence of Japan.

'Japan is not just a close ally, but also a close friend,' Mr Panetta said.

'I
 look forward to deepening that friendship and strengthening our 
partnership as, together, we address security challenges in the region.'

As yet, there has been no indication of when the 9,000 Marines will leave Okinawa. According to the joint statement, their departure will come 'when appropriate facilities are available to receive them' on Guam and elsewhere.

Under the new agreement, about 10,000 Marines will remain on Okinawa, which has been a key element of the U.S. military presence in Asia for decades. The U.S. also has a substantial Air Force presence on the island.

Japan's Foreign Minister Koichiro Gemba said the country wanted to 'reduce the burden on Okinawa,' adding, 'I think we have made some progress and this plan offers specific and forward-looking action.' 

Japan and its territories are central to America's strategy for deterring aggression in the region, and for reinforcing the Korean peninsula in the event of a North Korean attack on South Korea.

The Obama administration believes the new agreement with Japan will make the alliance more sustainable, while also giving the Marines more regional flexibility.

Between 4,700 and 5,000 Marines will relocate from Okinawa to Guam, while the remainder of the 9,000 will be transferred to Hawaii or be part of a rotational presence in Australia and elsewhere in the region.

Earlier this week, Governor of Hawaii Neil Abercrombie said he expects around 2,700 Marines will be moved there.

The cost of relocating Marines to Guam is expected to be around $8.6 billion, and defence officials claim Japan will pay $3.1 billion of this.

The total cost includes an unspecified amount for possible construction of new training ranges in the Northern Mariana Islands that could be used jointly by U.S. and Japanese forces.

Controversial: The transfer of Marines from Okinawa to Guam has been in limbo for years because of issues surrounding the U.S. air base Futenma

The agreement also calls for a phased
 return to Japanese control of certain parcels of land on Okinawa which 
are presently used by the American military.

The
 shift of Marines from Okinawa to Guam has been in limbo for years 
because it was linked to the closure and replacement of Marine Corps Air
 Station Futenma.

Okinawans
 fiercely oppose the existence of Futenma, and believe the base should 
be closed and a replacement established overseas or elsewhere in Japan. 
The U.S., however, has insisted that Japan should find a Futenma 
replacement on Okinawa.

For now, the dispute remains unresolved.

The accord was timed for completion before Japanese Prime Minster Yoshihiko Noda's 
scheduled visit to Washington on Monday for talks with President Barack 
Obama.

The U.S. military presence on Okinawa has been a cause of historic tension between America and Japan.

Many of the island's residents view the troops as a cause of congestion and increased crime.

Much of the bad feeling has its roots in the 1995 kidnapping and rape of a 12-year-old Japanese girl by three American servicemen.

U.S. Navy Seaman Marcus Gill and U.S. Marines Rodrico Harp and Kendrick Ledet kidnapped the schoolgirl before beating her, duct taping her eyes shut and raping her.

Gill pleaded guilty to the rape, and the other two men pleaded guilty to conspiracy.

A Japanese judge sentenced Gill and Harp to seven years' imprisonment, while Ledet received six and a half years.

The men were released in 2003, and dishonourably discharged from the U.S. military.

Unsurprisingly, the incident provoked a public outcry, and the people of Okinawa placed a full-page advert in the New York Times condemning the rape and other aspects of the U.S. presence on their island.

Although top U.S. government officials publicly apologised for the crime, tensions continued to brew and the incident remains fresh in the minds of many.
