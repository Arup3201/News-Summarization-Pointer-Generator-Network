Will not stand: Laura Sandys MP for South Thanet, says she is leaving in 2015 - despite having a majority of 7,000

Conservative HQ is braced for half a dozen MPs who only entered Parliament in 2010 – including rising female stars – to step down rather than fight the next election.

Laura Sandys, the party’s MP for South Thanet, yesterday announced that she is quitting in 2015 despite having a majority of more than 7,000.

The UK Independence Party accused her of running scared after its leader Nigel Farage floated the idea of standing in the seat.

Louise Mensch, the former MP for Corby, triggered a byelection which the Tories lost having decided to quit halfway through Parliament, while the Conservative MP for South Ribble, Lorraine Fullbrook, has also announced that she will stand down rather than fight to hold her seat.

One Cabinet source said it was feared that ‘half a dozen’ of the 2010 Conservative intake would opt to leave Parliament in what Labour was bound to call a ‘chicken run’.

Dr Sarah Wollaston, the independent-minded Conservative MP for Totnes, said she was ‘so sorry to see yet another talented female colleague stepping down’.

She added: ‘We need to detoxify this role. it’s both the aggressive atmosphere within Parliament and party politics and the indiscriminate, relentless hostility to MPs.’

Miss Sandys, whose father Duncan was Defence Secretary in Harold Macmillan’s government and the son-in-law of Winston Churchill, said she had taken the ‘heart-wrenching’ decision due to ‘a wide range of family demands’.

In a statement on her website, the 49-year-old said: ‘It is with great sadness and regret that I wish to announce that I will not be standing at the next general election in 2015.

‘For the last six months I have been considering my future in light of a wide range of family demands and have decided that I cannot combine the level of dedication and service needed for the constituency with my growing personal responsibilities to those closest and dearest to me.

‘It has been a difficult and heart-wrenching decision to make as there is no greater honour and privilege than representing the constituents of South Thanet.

‘I wish to assure you that between now and the next election I will work tirelessly to achieve more for our wonderful area, making representation for our causes, supporting community groups and taking on individual cases on behalf of residents.’

Rumours: It is speculated that UKIP Leader Nigel Farage could mount a challenge in the Kent seat

Her move will fuel speculation that Mr Farage could mount a challenge in the Kent seat. He previously stood there unsuccessfully in 2005, but the Eurosceptic party has surged in the polls since then.

Told of Miss Sandys’ decision, a spokesman for Mr Farage said: ‘She knew if he did pick Thanet South she would lose.’

Tris Osborne, a Labour councillor standing in 2015 in nearby Chatham and Aylesford, said: ‘Laura Sandys knows what every marginal Tory MP knows. UKIP will squeeze 3,000 to 4,000 of the vote on current percentage in Kent.’

Conservative chairman Grant Shapps paid tribute to Miss Sandys, hailing her as ‘one of the nicest people in politics’.
