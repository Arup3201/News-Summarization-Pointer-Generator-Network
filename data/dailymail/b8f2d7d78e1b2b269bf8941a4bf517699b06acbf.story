Former England defender Sol Campbell has not laced up his boots in the Premier League since appearing for Newcastle United in 2011, but evidently still enjoys the trappings of a footballer's lifestyle.

The ex-Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur centre back has just put his plush London pad up for sale... for an astonishing £25million!

But, if you don't want to buy the listed property outright then there is the rental option of course - for a cool £15,000 a week, down from the £75,000 a week on offer for a stay during the 2012 Olympics.

Former England defender Sol Campbell has put his Chelsea mansion up for sale for a cool £25million

The house has an outside rooftop terrace, as well as six bedrooms, five bathrooms and four living rooms

A 45-foot long garden comes with the house and there is also a library, as well as a drawing room

Well, for that sort of money you expect only the best and you certainly get it from this plush Chelsea pad right on the Thames riverbank.

The six-floor mansion was renovated in 2008 and has six bedrooms, five bathrooms (including three en suite), four living rooms and a double internal garage in the 7,224-square feet of space.

As if that wasn't enough, there is also a drawing room and a library for you to relax and spend some down time - as well as accommodation for 40-year-old Campbell's 'staff' in a separate annexe.

This double internal garage is a decent size and is something of a rarity in London

If you cannot afford the £25m to buy it then the house and garden are available to rent for £15,000 a week

And, during a beautiful summer's day in London, you have the option of wiling away the hours on the beautiful roof terrace or the 45-foot long garden.

Campbell, who officially retired in 2012, also represented Portsmouth and Notts County in a professional career spanning 19 years.

He scored 20 goals in 504 Football League appearances and was capped 73 times by England between 1996 and 2007, netting once.
