Tragic: Senior Labour backbencher Sir Stuart Bell died this morning after a short battle with pancreatic cancer

Senior Labour backbencher Sir Stuart Bell died this morning after losing his battle with pancreatic cancer.

The 74-year-old had been MP for Middlesbrough for nearly three decades and served in key positions in Parliament.

Sir Stuart died at home with his family around him.

Sir Stuart was the son of a Durham miner, and, after a grammar school education, was briefly a colliery clerk and newspaper reporter before becoming a barrister.

Having lived and worked in Paris for a spell, he returned in 1977 to pursue a career in politics.

Sir Stuart was elected to the City Council of Newcastle upon Tyne in 1980Â  and was a member of the council until he won Middlesbrough in 1983.

He went on to hold the seat through seven general elections.

While never serving as a minister, Sir Stuart was the party's Northern Ireland spokesman during the 1980s.

And later in his career he was handed a powerful role on the Commons Commission - the body responsible for running the House.

He played a central role during one of Parliament's most difficult periods, as the long-running scandal of MPs' expenses abuses finally emerged in 2009.
