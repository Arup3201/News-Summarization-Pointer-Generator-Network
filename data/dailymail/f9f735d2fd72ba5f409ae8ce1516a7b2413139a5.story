At half time on Sky Sports coverage of the Tyne & Wear derby from Newcastle, we were shown a small bronze bust of one of the City's favourite sons, Sir Bobby Robson. 

It appeared to capture almost perfectly the benign countenance that seemed to sum up his approach to football and his life. Although whether he would actually be looking quite so philosophical after losing at home to his deadly rivals, Sunderland, is likely another matter entirely. 

The reason we were being shown his statue was because that evening the channel premiered a new documentary that let us into the life and times of one our greatest managers, 'Once More For Bobby'.

It did this whilst also recounting the dogged two-wheeled journey undertaken by one of his former players, Robbie Elliott, to honour Sir Bobby's Foundation and raise money for other cancer charities. 

Along with his friend, triathlete Phil Gray, Robbie set out on a 3,500 mile bike ride that took in the clubs Sir Bobby managed across England and mainland Europe. 

And it was a journey that also worked perfectly as a metaphor for the years of endurance and triumph Sir Bobby put into both his work and also his very survival.

Because for Robbie and Phil, across their 25 day vigil, there was plenty of flogging uphill, cruising down hill and lots of rocky roads along the way. 

In terms of the ride itself, it quickly became clear that this was never going to be a walk in the park, as it were. Perfectly illustrated one day in France when they encountered the freakish annual phenomenon of the 'black wind'. 

To wax lyrical once again, the boys may have been pulling up trees for their cause, but so was the mistral that swiped across the countryside through which they rode. As Elliot put it, 'we could have pushed the bikes faster'.

Robson referred to his successful period as England manager as 'national service'

Elliot, too, had his own personal issues and at one point had gone four days without being able to keep down food or water. He eventually found a doctor who was prepared to put down his pizza long enough to pump the former Newcastle defender with as many IVs as he could find lying around his surgery. 

In spite of rough conditions and ill health, the two still managed to complete their journey. And some of the most engaging images were seen during the final leg, on their return to home soil. 

All of which climaxed with an emotional appearance at St James Park, where earlier in the documentary we had also seen Sir Bobby being greeted by a packed house of Geordies and two teams of retired stars, just five days before he died. 

Narrated by actor and arch fan Tim Healy, 'Once More For Bobby' isn't just a road movie, though. It also contains interviews with men who had first hand knowledge of Sir Bobby. And all of them couldn't have been more grateful for that fact. 

The best moments from the show are insights into the manager's relationships, including with wife Elsie

Paul Gascoigne said 'he was like a second dad to us'. At Camp Nou, former Barcelona player Ramon Alfonseda spoke strongly of his 'values'. 

Andre Villas-Boas explained how as a seventeen year old, Sir Bobby invited him to meet him the following morning, after a chance encounter, so that he could go to training with him. 

Both Alan Shearer and Gary Lineker suggested they owed their playing careers to him. His surgeon Huw Davies observed 'short of chaining him to a bed' he couldn't have stopped Sir Bobby working during his horrible illnesses because he had 'so much drive'. 

Journalist and patron of the Foundation George Caulkin spoke of his incredible success as an English manager abroad: 'How many (achieved) at the level he did? Well, none'.

But the most important words came from Robson himself, taken from his autobiography and spoken by actor Stephen Tompkinson. 

They provided lovely little insights into such things as his life with his beloved wife Elsie, his relationships with various players and clubs and colleagues ( '(Jose Mourinho) was under my wing for six years - he was exceptionally loyal and watched my back'), his 'eight seasons of national service' as England manager, and how, on being asked to manager Newcastle, 'the North East was calling me back. I was on my way home'. 

Not that the film always hits the target. Perhaps because of logistical or financial restraints, we didn't have the opportunity to see Robbie, in particular, interact with any of the contributors, or indeed fans at the various locations along the way, something that would have given the documentary a warmer, more personal touch and not make it feel quite so compartmentalized. 

Five years after his death, the new documentary is a fiiting tribute to one of football's greatest men

At times, too, there was just too much cycling to music, and not enough interaction between the friends. 

But really, their effort, coupled with both the cause and the story behind it is enough to make this a most engaging piece of television indeed. 

And five years on from his passing, it provides a timely reminder that this most affable and down-to-earth of football men really did know, and love, his business.
