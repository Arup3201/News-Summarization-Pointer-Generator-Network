Former Manchester United assistant Mike Phelan believes the Red Devils will be serious Premier League title contenders this season.

Under the stewardship of Louis van Gaal, United have enjoyed an unbeaten tour of America following a disastrous campaign with David Moyes at the helm last year.

Phelan, who spent five years as Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2, believes Dutchman Van Gaal has restored the belief among the Old Trafford squad and that optimism is high.

Right-hand man: Mike Phelan, who was Sir Alex Ferguson's No 2, believes United will challenge next term

Following a seventh-placed finish last season, Phelan is confident the Red half of Manchester can spring a few shocks next term.

Speaking to the Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast on talkSPORT, Phelan said: 'I don't see why not. Some people will probably scoff at that, but everybody is improving year on year. 

'United did take a backward step a little bit, but it is well within their capabilities to surprise a lot of people and rise to the occasion. They look now as though they have got belief in themselves.

'Obviously pre-season is pre-season. They have got to come back now and get some consistency in the league but there will be excitement there.

'They have got, in Van Gaal, somebody with terrific experience and great motivation. Add that to the ingredients already at Old Trafford, in the supporters and the expectation. I'm sure they could be right up there.'
