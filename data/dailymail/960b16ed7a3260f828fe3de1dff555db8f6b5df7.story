Exactly one year to the day since the Rob Ford crack scandal broke, reports out of Canada suggest the embattled Toronto mayor is at an Ontario rehab clinic.

Ford was spotted out and about in Bracebridge, close to both his family's cottage and an addiction rehabilitation center called GreenStone.

Ford's lawyer confirmed Friday that he is still undergoing treatment for his addiction problems, though he would not confirm where Ford is being treated.

According to the Bracebridge Examiner, Ford was seen outside a branch of the Bank of Montreal, 'chatting with passersby and telling people that rehab is going well.'

Numerous photographs posted to Twitter show the mayor posing amiably with local residents.

A woman who works at a local store told the National Post that the mayor's presence caused a lot of excitement, with about 20 people gathered to shake his hand and pose for photographs with him.

'He seemed really calm. He was willing to shake everyone’s hands. He seemed like a really nice guy,' she said.

Ford's lawyer, Dennis Morris, said his client hasn't completed his rehab treatment, 'not by a long shot.'

He's is allowed to leave the clinic to run personal errands such as banking, but otherwise he's in treatment '24/7,' he told the National Post.

GreenStone has not confirmed that Ford is one of its patients, but the Toronto Star reports that two insiders have confirmed Ford is staying at the facility.

On its website, GreenStone sounds luxurious.

'Located in a resort setting in scenic Muskoka, Ontario and equipped with holistic spa services, delicious, nutritious and seasonal menus offered through our Lodge Restaurant, and a full suite of fitness and recreation facilities,' reads the website.

Its accommodations consist of 'treetop cottages and executive townhouses' that 'feature rustic suites.'

Ford indicated to the Toronto Sun last week that his treatment could be costing as much as $100,000.

'It’s worth every dime, every dime,' he told Sun journalist Joe Warmington. 'A hundred grand is cheap. It’s a steal.'
