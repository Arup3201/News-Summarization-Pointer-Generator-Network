Fran Halsall was close to tears after beating the Australian Campbell sisters to become 50m freestyle champion, posting the fastest time in the world this year.

Halsall broke the British record in the semi-final and again in the final, touching the wall with an outstretched arm in 23.96sec, to hold off Cate Campbell and younger sibling Bronte and clinch a shock victory.

‘I felt sick before because I knew everything was going well and I sometimes try too hard,’ said Halsall, 24, ‘I was saying to my coach it is so nice to have this experience on home soil two years after London when I wasn’t in shape and where I wanted to be. To be able to enjoy the crowd and be swimming like that two years out from Rio is definitely good.’

Halsall had
 been dubbed a ‘smiling assassin,’ by Cate Campbell, 22, and she lived 
up to that nickname, beating her into second by 0.04sec.

Halsall
 is one of England’s most prolific Commonwealth medallists. Last night’s
 gold was her ninth to add to one gold, six silvers and one bronze won 
in Melbourne in 2006 and in Delhi four years ago.

But she was devastated after missing out on a podium spot in all five of her medal races at the London Olympics.

Halsall,
 whose team-mate Amy Smith came home eighth, added: ‘That was the target
 all year. I knew I was ready to swim it which made me more nervous. I 
wanted to get the results which I knew I could do and perform in a big 
final against some amazingly talented girls.

‘In
 the last five metres I was thinking, “No way am I winning this, I need 
to get my hand on the wall”. I am really happy and quite emotional.’

One
 of the heroes from the London Games, South African Chad Le Clos also 
took gold. The 22-year-old, who knocked Michael Phelps off his perch by 
winning the 200m freestyle title in London, won the same event here and 
it was celebrated like a home nation victory, such is the affection for 
him and his father Bert.

The
 pair produced one of the most genuinely touching moments of London 2012
 when Bert cried and embraced his son live on the BBC. Bert was cheering
 on his son again last night and Le Clos handed his gold medal to his 
father who was wearing a red t-shirt with his son’s face emblazoned 
across it.

Le
 Clos won in a new Games record of 1:55:07, more than a second ahead of 
Australian Grant Irvine. Le Clos’s compatriot Sebastien Rousseau took 
bronze.

But Le Clos revealed he feared missing the race after twisting his ankle getting off a bus yesterday afternoon.

‘When
 I got off the bus, I twisted my ankle at 1pm,’ he said, ‘I was nervous 
as I didn’t know if I was able to swim or not. I didn’t have that smooth
 a preparation. I wasn’t expecting to go fast in 200. I’m just really 
happy and so is my dad.’
