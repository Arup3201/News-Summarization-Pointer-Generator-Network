Frontier Airlines says 13 of its flights from Denver International Airport have been canceled because its aircraft were damaged by hail.

All flights were grounded on Wednesday afternoon because of a tornado warning and severe thunderstorms that brought hail and strong winds to the area. There were delays of about an hour and a half after operations resumed.

At least one tornado touched down in the town of Watkins, southeast of the airport, but no injuries were reported.

Hail the size of ping pong balls sent pedestrians running for cover in Colorado Springs, and cars slid on the hail on Interstate 70 in Aurora.

The hail piled up several inches deep, dented cars and broke windows out of some homes.

Officials used snow plows to clear the hail from the main airport access road.

At least four tornadoes were spotted in the region, but no significant damage was reported.

Severe: The weather system over Colorado is known as the 'Denver cyclone' and cases winds up to 60 mph

A tornado watch was in effect until 8 p.m. for Denver and 10 surrounding counties, as well as Goshen, Laramie and Platte counties in southeastern Wyoming.

The storms dropped heavy rain and hail around the Denver area. Tornado sirens rang across Denver and surrounding communities.

The storms were fueled by southeasterly winds fueled by a pattern known locally as the Denver cyclone - causing swirling winds of up to 60 mph.

According to the National Weather Service heavy 'half-dollar' sized hail fell in the area and residents near to Aurora, Bennett, Manila Village, Watkins and Buckley Air Force Base were advised to take cover.

'Denver's kind of in the clear right now unless something else develops,' said Jim Kalina of the Weather Service in Boulder.
