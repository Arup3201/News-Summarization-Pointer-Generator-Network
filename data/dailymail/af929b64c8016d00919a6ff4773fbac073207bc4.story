Joanne Armstrong opted for flat shoes during her court appearance after admitting using her stiletto heels during an attack

A pregnant teaching assistant battered a man with her stiletto heel during a late night gang attack on the stranger outside a bar.

Joanne Armstrong, aged 28, avoided jail after admitting repeatedly hitting Sean Kelly in the face with her shoe as he lay helpless on the pavement.

The mother-of-two, who didn’t realise she was pregnant with her second child at the time of the attack, was described as ‘having gone mental’ as she led the assault on the clubber barefoot and shrieking at the top of her voice.

Judge Michael Henshell, who sentenced Armstrong to an eight-month suspended jail sentence, labelled her behaviour as a ‘typical scene’ in Manchester witnessed every night of the week.

Armstrong has since been sacked from her job at St Chrysostom’s Primary School in Manchester.

The court heard she ‘wound up’ four or five unidentified thugs who followed the victim, knocked him to the ground and savagely kicked and stamped on him outside Baa Bar on Wilmslow Road, Fallowfield.

Armstrong appeared to be the ‘instigator’ of the 2.30am attack in April last year, witnesses said, even though she didn’t know Mr Kelly.

In the aftermath, the 26-year-old victim was rushed by ambulance to hospital and treated for a fractured jaw.

Armstrong, of Longsight, originally denied any involvement in the attack, but blood on her spiked heel exposed her lies and she was charged with grievous bodily harm.

She admitted the charge a few weeks before her trial was due to start.

Nicola
Hall, defending, told the court that Armstrong, who had never been in 
trouble before, was the ‘primary carer’ for her two young children.

The
court heard that at the time of the attack Armstrong was in a 
‘heightened emotional state’ - ‘reeling’ from the recent death of a 
friend and an argument with her boyfriend.

Unaware she was pregnant, she got ‘very drunk’ before becoming ‘embroiled’ in one of a number of violent incidents unfolding at closing time, the court heard.

Miss Hall said: ‘There’s no indication
that she takes anything other than the view that this was utterly 
unacceptable behaviour. It was an isolated incident from a lady who was 
of very good character.’

Miss Hall quoted from a reference which said Armstrong had been an ‘excellent teaching assistant’.

Sentencing, Judge Michael Henshell said she had used her shoe as a ‘significant weapon’.

He
added: ‘The assault that took place on Mr Kelly was very typical of the
obnoxious scenes that occur in the city on every night of the week.’

She must also complete 100 hours of unpaid work.
