Behind the scenes:  This series of behind the scenes photographs of the world famous star are believed to have been taken by an Army photographer, since she is smiling and posing for the camera back stage

The visit was the only time the blonde bombshell entertained troops in her career as a singer and movie star.

A set of 13 black and white photographs, taken by an official army photographer, capture touching behind the scenes moments from the tour.

Monroe, who was aged 28 at the time, is seen in combat boots and black trousers and a flight jacket chatting to soldiers and signing autographs in the 8ins by 10ins prints.

Several images show her on stage wowing crowds in a sparkling cocktail dress while in others she is wearing her famed houndstooth dress from her film Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

A set of four colour slides depict Monroe mingling and laughing with troops and signing autographs.

The trip, for which she interrupted her honeymoon, was said to set the tone for her marriage to Joe DiMaggio; the couple divorced eight months later

Margaret Barrett, director of entertainment at Heritage Auctions, said: 'These photos came from a collector who bought them about 18 years ago for very little money.

'It isn't known who shot the photos but we think it would have been an official Army photographer because they are professional images.

'There were thousands of soldiers there all with their cameras but these photos show Marilyn behind the scenes posing for the camera and signing things for VIPs.

'There are not too many quality photos of this trip, especially ones such as these which capture the behind the scenes moments,' Mrs Barrett said

'It was the only trip she did to see troops and in fact she only ever visited England after that trip - she wasn't a world traveller.

'These photos are really nice and have never been seen before. The photographer was with Marilyn at all the events she went to while in Korea.'

Mrs Barrett said Marilyn's trip to Korea 'really set the tone' for her relationship with DiMaggio. She interrupted their honeymoon to fly to Korea to sing for thousands of troops and, just eight months later, the couple were divorced.

'At the time Marilyn was the biggest star in the world and it was a huge event for the troops,' she said.

'There are not too many quality photos of this trip, especially ones such as these which capture the behind the scenes moments.

'There is an enormous market for Marilyn memorabilia - people are not getting sick of her at all.

The monochrone, set of four colour slides and short reel of footage will all go under the hammer at a Texas auction next month

'She has been gone 50 years and she is still arguably the biggest star in the world.

'Bidding will start low but we expect there to be fierce competition for the items.'

The auction will be held at Heritage Auctions in Dallas, Texas, on August 10.
