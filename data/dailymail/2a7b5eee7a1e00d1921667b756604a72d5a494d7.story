United have given their record signing round-the-clock security from members of their own CES security group.

And according to The Sun, Di Maria's wife Jorgelina Cardoso is not keen to return to the house. 

The Manchester United star was the victim of a terrifying raid when burglars are believed to have used scaffolding poles to smash their way in to his home.

Three thieves used the metal poles to break through patio doors while the Argentina winger, his wife Jorgelina  and one-year-old daughter Mia were at the Cheshire mansion.

The break-in occurred at 7.30pm, just hours after the 26-year-old starred for United in their 3-1 win over Leicester City at Old Trafford in the Barclays Premier League.

Di Maria was pictured on Monday night checking into the Lowry Hotel in Salford with the rest of his Manchester United team-mates ahead of their FA Cup fourth-round replay with Cambridge United on Tuesday.

And Di Maria's team-mate Luke Shaw says Manchester United have made the FA Cup their priority because they are desperate to end the year with silverware.

'The whole team look at it as a trophy we all want to win,' the United left-back said.

'And especially now it's what you could say is the main priority because the league, I wouldn't say it's gone, but we're quite far away, so we're definitely looking to win the FA Cup.'
