Detectives are confident of finally identifying the man whose decapitated, burnt torso was found in Gympie in September of last year.

The new hope has come after tests revealed that the victim, whose body was discovered on the side of Cedar Pocket Rd, was taking both the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine.

Police have since obtained a list of people known to have been taking similar medication and have begun conducting doorknocks of the individuals.

Unsolved mystery: A torso, found on Cedar Pocket Rd, pictured, in September 2013, could be identified now that police have found the the hypertension drug Irbesartan and Quinine in the body's system

'We are working our way through the Queenslanders first. A breakthrough could come from the next door we knock on,' Detective Inspector Bruce McNab told The Courier-Mail.

Information from Crime Stoppers obtained by police in the last fortnight regarding a number of people missing people, is also considered hopeful for the investigation.

The man is believed to be caucasian, aged between 40 and 80 and between 180cm and 190cm tall.

He was of a solid build with a large frame and chest but not overweight.

Police believed he was involved in difficult manual labour due to spurs, called osteophytes, on his backbone.

They maintain that the head found 45 kilometres away in a tree plantation about 1km off Cooloola Coast Rd on April 11, is not linked to the torso.

The grim discovery of the torso left Gympie, with a population of about 18,000, horrified when it was found burning on the side of the road. 

Clues: A burnt towel was found near the the burning torso

The torso was decapitated above the collarbone and below the rib cage and had its hands gruesomely hacked off at the wrist.

Tests indicated the torso belonged to an athletic man, who was taking medication for high blood pressure, malaria, cramps and restless leg syndrome.

There were no tattoos on his upper chest and there was no match on the DNA database, which means he had no criminal history.

The torso revealed a 3cm scar on the right side of the man's back, about halfway down, from an old injury.

Cadaver dogs were also been used as part of police investigations.

With the mystery baffling Queensland police, the FBI and international forensic experts are being used to help solve the case.

Insp McNab said items of interest had been discovered in the search of Toolara State Forest, but could not reveal what they were.

'We have found some other items of interest during the search we have done of the area and we are still searching there,' he said. 'We are not able to say what those items are.'

Call for help: Queensland police are asking for public assistance with the ongoing investigations

The charred towel found near the torso was wrapped in tarp-like material. A plain-coloured T-shirt was also found.

Police are looking for a female suspect, described as small to medium build, middle aged, with blonde to brown shoulder-length hair.

It is believed she was wearing black exercise pants to her knee and driving an orange to brown hatchback.

Sighted in the Gympie area for about an hour on the night of September 19, the woman was seen at her car on the side of Cedar Creek Rd, outside the town's centre.

The woman was also seen leaning over a grass area near the road's edge but kept her head down, with her back to the road.

At 6.30pm, shortly after she left the area, passing motorists saw a fire at the same grass area.

The fire revealed a burning torso, which had been doused in an ­accelerant and set alight.
