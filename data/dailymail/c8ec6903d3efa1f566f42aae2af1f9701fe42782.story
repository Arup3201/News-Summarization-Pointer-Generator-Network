Pakistan's army has arrested ten Taliban militants suspected of shooting teenage gender equality campaigner, Malala Yousafzai, in the head in 2012.

Activist, Malala, won world recognition after she was brutally attacked and left fighting for her life for advocating gender equality and education for women.

After receiving emergency treatment in Pakistan, she was flown to Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham and now lives in Britain with her family.

Speaking today, Army spokesman General Asim Saleem Bajwa, said the detained men attacked Malala, then 14, on orders from Mullah Fazlullah, the head of the Pakistani Taliban. 

The army is currently waging war against the extremist group in North Waziristan, a tribal region on the border of Afghanistan that has long been a terrorist stronghold. 

Their offensive operation was launched on June 15 after militants attacked one of the country's busiest airports, in the southern city of Karachi, shocking the nation. 

Mr Bajwa said that 'the entire gang involved in the murder attempt... has been busted'.

He confirmed that the 'terrorists' were part of Tehrik-e-Taliban - an umbrella group encompassing several militant organizations across the tribal areas.

Pakistani Major General Asim Bajwa today announced the capture of the militants who shot schoolgirl Malala Yousafza in the head in October 2012

Malala, now 16, was shot in the head in October 2012 while returning home from school.

The precocious teenage activist had been calling for expanding girls' education in deeply conservative areas of Pakistan at the time.

She is from the same region that was once home to Taliban chief, Fazlullah - the man who ordered her assassination.

Fazlullah was elevated to his current leadership position after his predecessor, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in North Waziristan. 

He is credited with leading the Taliban takeover of Swat in 2007 in an attempt to overthrow the government and impose a harsh version of Islamic law.

Just a few hours drive from Islamabad, the valley was only reclaimed after a major military operation was launched in 2009 - and since then Fazlullah has been on the run.

Pakistan believes he is now hiding in Afghanistan, and Mr Bajwa said Islamabad has raised the issue with the Afghan government. 

Both countries have long accused each other of ignoring militants who launch cross-border attacks from their territory.

Mr Bajwa did not say when or where the men were captured, but said security agencies caught all ten in a sting operation after acting on a tip-off from a Taliban member inside the same cell. 

The head of the cell had also been arrested.

Speaking about Malala's shooting, Mr Bajwa said: 'The group acted upon the instructions of Mullah Fazlullah who, while based in Kunar, Afghanistan, passed instructions through his two associates.

'We will continue our efforts until (Fazlullah) is arrested or killed.'

He added that it was a 'known fact' that Fazlullah and other 'terrorists' are hiding in Afghanistan. 

The military says it has so far killed at least 975 militants and that the operation is 'progressing' as planned.
