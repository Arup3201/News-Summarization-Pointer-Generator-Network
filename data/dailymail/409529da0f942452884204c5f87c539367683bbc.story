Wimbledon women's semi-finalist Agnieszka Radwanska has been dropped by a Catholic youth movement she had been representing after appearing naked on the front cover of a magazine.

The Polish tennis star, who is the world number four, was pictured nude sat in a plastic deckchair next to a swimming pool filled with tennis balls in the shoot for a special 'Body Issue' of ESPN Magazine.

She posed side-on while clutching two tennis balls in the image, shielding her modesty with careful positioning of her arms.

The 24-year-old is a proud Catholic but youth group Krucjata Mlodych (Youth Crusade) has condemned the shoot as 'immoral behaviour' and dropped her from its campaigns.

She had starred in a commercial for the group where she spells out 'Jesus' with tennis balls and tells people not to be ashamed of their faith.

Senior Catholic priest Father Marek Dziewiecki said: 'It's a shame that someone who has declared their love for Jesus is now promoting the mentality of men looking at a woman as a thing rather than a child of God worthy of respect and love.

'If she meets a man who she can truly love and establish a happy family and raise Catholic children, then she would probably have to hide these pictures from relatives.'

Poland is a strongly religious country with 90 per cent of the population describing themselves as Catholic.

Miss Radwanska normally keeps herself to herself despite being a sporting superstar in Poland, so the revealing images have sparked a media frenzy in the country.

The tennis player, who lost to Germany's Sabine Lisicki in this year's Wimbledon semi-final, appeared confident about her body in the photo shoot.

In an interview with ESPN Magazine she said: 'I feel fortunate that I can stay pretty lean without having to do too much gym work.'

And she said she liked to do 300 sit-ups at a time to make her stomach 'rock hard'.

But she also admitted a weakness for fast foods, saying some of her favourite meals are 'McDonald's cheeseburgers or cheesecakes from The Cheesecake Factory. I am proud to say I have tried every single one!'

She also revealed a strange habit of filling up on food around half an hour before her matches.

'Unlike most players, who eat at least two hours before matches, I can 
eat a full meal and go straight out on the court. In fact, I prefer to 
do that,'' she told the magazine.

'My usual routine is a plate of pasta 30 minutes before I'm due 
to go on court. If I don't, I end up starving midmatch. That habit dates
 back to when my dad used to pick me up from school and drive me 
straight to matches. We had no time for dinner, so I had to stuff myself
 in the car.'
