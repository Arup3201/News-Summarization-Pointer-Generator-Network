A rugby-loving boy has been told he cannot play his favourite sport because he wears glasses - despite having special goggles worth hundreds of pounds.

Adam Clayton, from Darlington, was named player of the year last year but was devastated when new safety rules barred him from matches.

The under-9s player is too young to wear contact lenses so his mother Emma, 33, bought the sports goggles - but they are still banned under the rules, which rugby chiefs admit are unfair.

Fed up: Adam Clayton, 9, was told he can no longer play rugby, despite his mother buying him special goggles

Mrs Clayton accused the the Rugby Football Union 
(RFU) and International Rugby Coard (IRB) of discriminating against players with poor eyesight.

'Adam loves rugby,' she added. 'He won player of the
year last year and he has a big trophy that he's so proud of, but now 
he's been told that he can't play.

Conversion: Emma Clayton, left, changed her son Adam's glasses for goggles but had no luck

'I
spent hundreds of pounds on special goggles for sport, that his 
optician is happy for him to wear, but we're being told they're not 
considered safe.

'The IRB 
said they're looking at introducing their own goggles but I don't know 
how they'll be safer than the ones he already has, which are licensed 
for sport.

'Adam is 
devastated at not being able to play. He's keen and he wants to be 
active, which helps his asthma, but the regulations won't let him.'

The goggles are allowed for non-contact rugby and for under-8s, but not for children any older.

Mrs Clayton added she has been told Adam will be able to take part in training, but not full matches.

The regulations ban players from having rigid materials on their faces because they can be a danger to themselves or people they tackle.

Several parents have complained to the RFU, which is now trying to revoke the policy.

A statement by the RFU said: 'Players of all age grades are permitted to wear spectacles, glasses or specifically designed sports goggles in all forms of non-contact rugby but not in any form of contact rugby.

'This means that under-9s and above are not permitted to wear any eye wear when playing contact rugby.

'The RFU recognises that this prohibition is not socially inclusive and creates difficulties for children with impaired eyesight who are not yet able to wear contact lenses.

'For these reasons, the RFU is talking to the IRB to permit under-12s and below to wear sports goggles, subject to certain conditions.

'The RFU and IRB are undertaking significant work to reach a common consensus on this as quickly as possible and we hope to be able to report back on a definitive positive solution shortly after the New Year.'
