Tesla boss Elon Musk is involved in a number of ventures - from electric cars to establishing a colony on Mars.

Now the eccentric entrepreneur wants to create battery-powered homes.

During an earning’s call, Mr Musk said the firm is going to unveil a Tesla ‘home battery’ - and it should start going into production by the summer.

Elon Musk said his Tesla firm has designed a ‘home battery’ that is expected to go into production by the summer. He didn’t reveal how the battery would be used, but it could act as a generator during a power cut

It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S.

‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts.

‘We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.’

The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology.

The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. 

The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment.

Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. 

Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery.  

He didn’t reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example.

As The Verge pointed out, rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home.

According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. 

Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a $5billion ‘Gigafactory’ designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes.

Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. 

The technology is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla’s range of electric cars such as the Model S. ‘We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people’s houses or businesses fairly soon,’ Mr Musk told analysts during yesterday's earnings call

Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. 

On the earnings call, Tesla also announced that during the fourth quarter of last year sales of its Model S vehicle fell short of predictions.

The firm said it shipped a total of 9,834 sedans - 1,136 off the company’s 11,000 target.

The man who invented the lithium battery (pictured) - which  powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he is working on a super battery

The man who invented the lithium battery - which powers almost every portable device on the planet - claims he may have another  invention up his sleeve.

Professor John Goodenough first demonstrated that lithium cobalt oxide could be used to create a rechargable battery capable of storing energy in 1979 at Oxford University.

Now, aged 92 and at the University of Texas at Austin, he is working on a new type of 'super battery' that could change the way we use electricity. 

Professor Goodenough instead wants to use pure lithium or sodium metal as the negative electrode.

This would, in theory, allow batteries to store 60 per cent more energy than current lithium ion batteries.

That would also mean electric cars - which currently have a maximum range of up to 265 miles on a single charge - could make much longer journeys before needing to be recharged.

It could also allow new ways to economically store power produced by renewable energy.
