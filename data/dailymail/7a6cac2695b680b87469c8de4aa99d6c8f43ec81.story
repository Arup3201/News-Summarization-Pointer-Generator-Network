Darren Scott, 26, allegedly attacked his flatmate with a kitchen knife midway through a massage at his luxury Mayfair flat, a court has heard

A conman plunged a kitchen knife into his housemate's neck  at his luxury Mayfair apartment before screaming 'you're going to die' as the alleged victim begged for mercy, the Old Bailey has heard.

Darren Scott, 26, allegedly slashed the man's throat midway through a friendly massage, before stabbing him repeatedly in a scene 'straight out of a horror movie'. 

The victim, a writer - who cannot be named for legal reasons - managed to break free from the frenzied attack and lock himself in the bathroom, while blood was gushing from his wounds, the court was told.

He then banged on the door shouting 'murder', before pleading with Scott to call an ambulance.

But Scott screamed ‘you’re going to die’ before throwing a chair at the bathroom door and trying to kick his way through, the court heard.

Scott, who had moved into the plush London flat just two weeks earlier, was later arrested while socialising in a jazz bar in Brough, near Hull.

The court heard he had used his alleged victim's bank card to pay for the £280 train fare.

Prosecutor John Clifford told the Old Bailey how the alleged victim had feared Scott was a ‘psychopath’ due to his 'big, staring eyes'.

But he had still allowed him to move into his flat, just one day after they had met online, in July last year.

After he had moved in, Scott began taking pictures of the apartment and sending them to his friends, claiming it was paid for by his new employers Procter and Gamble, the court was told.

But it later emerged Scott had forged documents, falsely claiming that he worked for the company. Another document showed a £420,000 payment into a bank account that did not exist, the court was told.

Scott also allegedly used his new friend’s bank card to pay for the train trip to Hull, as well as to go on a £1,700 spending spree at House of Fraser.

The court was told how the alleged incident unfolded after Scott offered to give his new friend a massage at around 9am on July 3 last year. 

Midway through, Scott said he was going to get some salt water from the kitchen, the court heard. He then allegedly told his friend to lie on his back and put a t-shirt over his face, before changing the soothing music to ‘quite loud and angry’ sounds.

Mr Clifford told the court: ‘It was then that (he) became aware that Mr Scott began tapping, trying to find a vein in his neck’.

'The next thing he was aware of, he had been stabbed without warning by Mr Scott in the neck.

‘Immediately he tried to get up using his arms to protect himself from the blows of the knife which continue to rain down upon him.’

Mr Clifford said the victim struggled free and locked himself in the en-suite bathroom, while he had blood gushing from his neck. 

He said: ‘At this stage, he had blood quite literally gushing from his wounds, over the door to the bedroom, over the floor, over the inside of the shower - it was something you would only expect to see in a horror movie.

‘Having managed to get inside the en-suite bathroom, he became aware of a loud crashing sound as if something had been thrown against the door.

‘He was in a state of panic with blood gushing from his wounds to the neck, to the nine stab wounds to the upper part of his body, to the 12 other injuries to his arms and hands, banged on the bathroom wall, crying “murder” repeatedly.

‘Alas, these cries were not answered by anyone at all. During this time, Mr Scott was just outside the door screaming: “You’re going to die”.’

Mr Clifford said the trapped victim tried to reason with Scott, but the knifeman instead broke down crying and refused to call for help.

He then said something 'very significant', Mr Clifford told the court.

‘He said: “If you die, then I will get life, but if you live then I’ll only get 14 years",' he said.

‘That was a very chilling and sinister remark to make, something which you may think says a lot about Mr Scott’s state of mind on that day.’

In the aftermath of the alleged attack, Scott told his friends he had been attacked by potential investors who had pulled out a knife.

He took a train to Brough near Hull to stay with a friend, but was arrested the next day while socialising in a jazz bar in the town.

After his arrest, detectives unravelled a web of deception that Scott had left in his wake, the court was told.

Mr Clifford said the victim had ‘thought Scott was a psychopath' after they had been living together for just a few days, but dismissed the thought because he was ‘intrigued by Scott’.

‘It was during this time that Mr Scott was in effect ingratiating himself to (his victim), and indeed was not only using his bank cards but was taking pictures of the flat, a well-appointed flat on three floors in Mayfair, sending it to his friends, and in effect saying look at my new place, look at how well I’ve done for myself,' Mr Clifford told the court. 

'That’s only the tip of the iceberg with regards to the deception carried out by Mr Scott.’

Mr Clifford said Scott had a forged job offer from Procter and Gamble and a bogus letter from the courts service saying he had been given £420,000 in compensation.

The jury also heard Scott had been ‘helping himself’ to his alleged victim's bank cards.

‘It is alleged that Mr Scott abused his bank card to purchase train tickets, first class, from London back to Hull where his parents lived at a cost of £280.50’, he said.

‘Mr Scott has pleaded guilty to using a House of Fraser bank card to make purchases in the order of £1700.’

He also had a set of keys with the address of another Mayfair flat written on the fob, the court heard.

Scott, of no fixed address, denies attempted murder, wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, fraud and possession of an article for use in fraud.

He has admitted a second count of fraud over the House of Fraser shopping

The trial continues.
