A coroner lashed out at paramedics who refused to get into a water-filled ditch to help a dying man because of health and safety concerns.

Road accident victim Michael Thornton was lifted on to dry land only when a policeman arrived, by which time it was too late to save him.

At the inquest into the 30-year-old farmer’s death coroner Michael Rose declared: ‘I will not say what I think of health and safety regulations. I was brought up in a country where men risked their lives to save the lives of others.’

Mr Thornton was knocked unconscious 
when the Land Rover in which he was a passenger crashed on the Somerset 
Levels and flipped into the 10ft-wide drainage ditch. His two friends 
managed to haul him on to the side of the upturned vehicle and attempted
to revive him.

But they were unable to carry him up 
the slippery banks, and when two male paramedics arrived they made a 
snap ‘risk assessment’ and refused to get into the water to help.

In stark contrast, a policeman who arrived minutes later went straight into the water and pulled Mr Thornton on to the road.

His death is the latest in a series of
cases in recent years in which ‘risk assessments’ stopped emergency 
crews from going to the aid of victims, in some cases costing lives.

Mr Rose, coroner for West Somerset, 
said: ‘I was brought up in a country where men risked their own lives to
save the lives of others. That was a period in our history which has 
almost ceased. I do praise the actions of Pc Day, who dived in, but by 
that stage it was too late.’

At the inquest in Taunton last week, 
Mr Rose recorded an accidental death verdict and did not say if Mr 
Thornton could have been saved if the paramedics had gone in.

The paramedics’ employers insist the 
crew had to stay dry to provide ‘advanced life support’ such as 
defibrillation, which could have proved fatal for everyone at the scene 
if carried out too close to the water.

The inquest heard that Mr Thornton, 
from East Brent, Somerset, had been drinking with friends Jason Cheal 
and Matthew Braddick, 27, at a pub in Brent Knoll before the accident 
last November.

Mr Braddick was nearly twice over the alcohol limit as he drove them home just after midnight in his Land Rover Discovery.

He crashed into the ditch in 
Rooksbridge on the Somerset Levels near Weston-super-Mare, claiming 
later that he had swerved to avoid an animal in the road.

Many unlit roads in the area are lined
by ditches, or ‘rhynes’, which in winter are often filled with water 
and can be dangerous to motorists.

Mr Braddick was later convicted of 
drink-driving and banned from the road for three years but Mr Rose said 
he did not think that was the main cause of the accident.

He said they had not been doing over 
30mph and may well have swerved to avoid an animal. ‘This is a tragic 
case,’ he said. ‘The deceased had his whole life ahead of him.’

The ditch depth was not measured but 
is estimated at 5ft, with knee-deep mud at the bottom. The ambulance 
response time was not mentioned at the inquest but it was not thought to
have been delayed.

The coroner found the primary cause of
death was drowning, coupled with reduced consciousness and a traumatic 
head injury, with a secondary cause of intoxication.  Yesterday Mr 
Thornton’s family could not be reached for comment.

But local Conservative councillor 
Peter Burridge-Clayton said: ‘I share some of the coroner’s concerns. I 
think we need to see more of a balance between these strict health and 
safety laws and letting paramedics do their work.

‘If the legislation wasn’t quite so stringent then perhaps the man could have been saved.’

Paying tribute to Mr Thornton, who had
his own agricultural businesses, his girlfriend Liz Richardson, 35, 
said: ‘Michael was a loving, kind and gentle man. His parents and I want
to thank the policeman who tried to save him.

‘Michael is so missed by family and friends. He was a very hard worker and would do anything for anyone.’

At the time of his death last year his
mother Mandy Phillips, 53, said: ‘It still doesn’t seem real and I 
expect him to walk back through the door. We will miss him terribly. He 
always had a smile on his face.’

South Western Ambulance Trust extended
its condolences but said it was ‘confident the crew made an appropriate
risk assessment and administered the best possible care’.

A spokesman added: ‘They would have 
been unable to administer any higher standard of life support on an 
upturned vehicle, in the middle of the water, than that which was 
already being performed by the individual on scene.’

The crew were concerned by the unknown
depth of the water. If one of them got into trouble, it would have 
affected the treatment they could provide, the spokesman said.

‘The clinical preference would always 
have been to wait for the fire service to rescue the patient from the 
water. There is no question the paramedics made exactly the right 
choices and performed admirably.’

Tory councillor for neighbouring 
Cheddar, Dawn Hill, said: ‘Your natural instinct would be to jump in and
help. It is very sad that health and safety laws stop paramedics from 
doing their job.’
