Apartment hunting can be stressful. More so if there are some things that you just can’t live without.

Lots of storage, a view, an en-suite bathroom, air conditioning – how about a garage in the sky?

The apartments at 200 11th Avenue in New York’s fashionable West Chelsea gallery district feature just that – and more.

The ability to drive a car into an elevator that then whisks you up to your apartment is no doubt what has already drawn Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban, and designer Domenico Dolce to the building.
