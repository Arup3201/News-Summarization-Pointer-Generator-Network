The so-called Plain Jane Bandit who is believed to have carried out six bank heists and two attempted robberies since July 12 has been arrested.

Sylvia Helen Garcia, 38, was caught near her Downey, California home on Thursday night after the FBI reportedly received multiple tips about her.

The Plain Jane Bandit last struck on Tuesday but fled before getting any money, reported ABC news. 

Plain Jane Bandit arrested: Sylvia Helen Garcia, 38, who is  believed to be the Plain Jane Bandit responsible for robbing six banks in southern California since July 12, was arrested Thursday night

Captured: The arrest comes after a $10,000 reward for any information on the bank robber was offered by U.S. Bank

The arrest comes after U.S. Bank officials offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the womanâ€™s capture and conviction.

Garcia allegedly began her crime spree on July 12 with two robberies, one unsuccessful, in the city of Moreno Valley.

The FBI confirmed that the suspect struck three other U.S. Bank branches in Buena Park, Whittier and Santa Fe Springs.

The string of robberies began with the
 first one on July 12 in Santa Fe Springs and the next bank hit was in 
Whittier on July 19.

Then, on July 23, FBI officials said 
that the Plain Jane Bandit had struck a Chase Bank Branch and a U.S. 
Bank branch in Moreno Valley.

Tip offs: Witnesses previously described the 'Plain Jane Bandit' as a Hispanic female with a scar near her right eye

Busted: The bank robber (pictured) indicated to bank employees that she had an accomplice waiting outside

Notorious: Garcia allegedly robbed banks in various locations (pictured) in southern California during a three week crime spree

The next heist was on July 24 at a U.S. Bank branch in a grocery store in the city of Wildomar.

Garcia is also believed to have robbed
 another U.S. Bank in the city of Buena Park on Tuesday before hitting 
the branch in Wildomar.

During each robbery, the woman has 
made demands, in writing and verbally, and said an accomplice was 
waiting for her outside, reported ABC news. However, the accomplice was 
never seen.

Investigators chose her nickname based on the statement of a witness who described her as â€˜plain Janeâ€™.

Witness reports described the robber 
as a Hispanic female, 35 to 40 years old, about 5 feet 5 inches tall and
 weighing about 160 to 180 pounds. The robber was also linked to a 
silver, four-door car with a sunroof.

She did not wear a disguise for any of the robberies.
