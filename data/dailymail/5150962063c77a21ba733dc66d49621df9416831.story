He usually keeps his Oscars work backstage.

But a Matt Damon lookalike accountant saw his experience at the Academy Awards take a very public turn Sunday night - after he was dragged onstage and ribbed by host Neil Patrick Harris.

Brian Cullinan, a boss at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), is one of just two people trusted with the secret of who has won the coveted awards before the results are announced to the world, which he stashes away in a locked briefcase.

'Has anyone ever told you?' Neil Patrick Harris brought Brian Cullinan on-stage to point out that he looks like Matt Damon

This year, however, he was given an extra job - to guard the key to a second briefcase containing Harris's predictions for how the 87th Academy Awards would play out.

After the gongs had been awarded, Cullinan was brought out by Harris, who grilled him on his job as guardian of the Oscars secrets.

It was then he dropped the surprise line: 'Anyone ever tell you, you look just like Matt Damon?', seizing on the uncanny resemblance.

Before he could answer, Harris had swept away with the key to unveil his secret box, leaving Cullinan to make his way off the stage.

This Oscars was Cullinan's second as one of PwC's twin gatekeepers of the academy's secrets.

Along with newly-appointed Martha Ruiz, he oversees the process by which some 6,000 voters' choices are assembled and counted.

According to the Hollywood Reporter, the stacks of votes for each category are split into smaller piles and doled out to PwC staffers.

They then tally up the votes in their pile - but don't know the winners as they haven't seen all the votes.

Their results are then passed on to Cullinan and Ruiz, who calculate the final total and commit the winners' list to memory.

Later, they make two identical briefcases filled with the winning envelopes, which are locked and kept under armed guard until the night itself, a process which has been refined over the 81 years PwC has been in charged of the process.

However, seizing the spotlight, for however short a time, was never part of the playbook.
