A father who inadvertently missed the birth of his first two children has delivered his third.

Mechanic Steve Denyer, 37, had appendicitis when first child Mason, now five, was born.

During the birth of second son, Frazer, now three, he fainted at the sight of blood.

But when wife Kirsty, 35, went into labour at their home in Lancing, West Sussex, he was forced to overcome his fears to help deliver his third son.

Mr Denyer said: 'I was disappointed at missing the first birth and the second was my fault because I was a bit squeamish.

'But I couldn't really get out of being there for the third!

'I was fast asleep when Kirsty got up with backache. She went to the bathroom and then her waters broke.

'She called out and I was still half asleep. When I got in there to help her I saw a little head was poking out.

'I called the ambulance and the woman on the phone asked me 'have you delivered a baby before?'

Steve then spent half an hour on the phone receiving valuable help from a dispatcher.

He said: 'When the baby's head appeared, the lady on the phone told me to wipe it's face from nose to mouth and as I did that he let out a cry.

'She said that was exactly what she wanted to hear, and at that moment I felt so relieved.'

A paramedic finally arrived to help finish the birth and Ollie Junior was born just after 7am, weighing 8lbs 12oz.

'The paramedics who arrived were brilliant. I'd done most of it already by then but they took over and checked the baby was all right.'
