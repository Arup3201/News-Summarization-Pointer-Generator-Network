Two men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act after a suspect package was found today.

Fifteen homes were evacuated in Torquay when police were called to a house in Lymington Road at about 11am after residents raised the alarm.

Two men, aged 18 and 20, both for Torquay, were initially arrested on suspicion of criminal damage.

But Devon and Cornwall Police rearrested them on suspicion under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act - the preparation of a terrorist act.

The road was cordoned off as police searched the house and the area was closed for about five hours.

Devon and Cornwall Police said the first arrest led officers to search a property where 'potentially dangerous' items were found.

Bomb disposal experts and the fire service were also involved in the operation.

The area was later reopened and residents allowed to return to their homes, but police remain at the site.

A
spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said: 'Police have spent much 
of today searching an address in Lymington Road, which required the 
evacuation of a small number of neighbouring properties.

'The 20-year-old man and 18-year-old man, both from Torquay, remain in police custody at this time.'

Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 allows a police officer to arrest anyone he 'reasonably suspects' to be a terrorist.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
