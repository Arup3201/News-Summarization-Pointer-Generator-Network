Prosecution: Gillian Astbury, 66, died at Stafford Hospital after staff failed to give her insulin. The Health and Safety Executive will now prosecute Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust

The hospital trust at the centre of one of the worst care scandals in living memory is to be prosecuted over the death of a patient from neglect.

Mid Staffordshire is to be taken to court by the Health and Safety Executive after a 66-year-old woman died when nurses failed to realise she suffered from diabetes.

The NHS trust will be prosecuted as an organisation, meaning that individual nurses, doctors and managers will not face jail for their failings.

Hundreds of patients are feared to have died unnecessarily at Mid Staffordshire between 2005 and 2009, and earlier this year a damning report warned that many others had suffered inhumane abuse.

Gillian Astbury, who suffered from diabetes, was admitted to Stafford Hospital in April 2007  following a fall at home. She was put under the care of a team of nurses who did not bother to read her medical notes and failed to realise she was diabetic and needed regular doses of insulin. She fell into a coma and died ten days after first being admitted on to the ward.

Her friend and carer, Ron Street, said that when he went to visit her she was often in soiled bed linen and her meals would be left out of reach.

The HSE began investigating the death in April, having postponed its probe until after the publication in February of a major report following a public inquiry into the scandal.

Deaths: Up to 1,200 people died needlessly at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital

It has now concluded that there is 
enough evidence to charge the trust under the Health and Safety at Work 
Act, for failing to protect others against risks to health and safety.

The
first hearing will be in October at Stafford Magistrates Court, but the
case could go on for several months before reaching a verdict.

Peter
Galsworthy, head of operations of the HSE in the West Midlands, said: 
‘We have concluded our investigation into the death of Gillian Astbury 
at Stafford Hospital and have decided there is sufficient evidence and 
it is in the public interest to bring criminal proceedings in this case.

‘HSE will be charging Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust under Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act.

‘Gillian Astbury died on April 11 2007, of diabetic ketoacidosis, when she was an inpatient at the hospital.

The prosecution follows an investigation launched earlier this year by the HSE into Mrs Astbury¿s death

‘The
immediate cause of death was the failure to administer insulin  to a 
known diabetic patient. Our case alleges that the trust failed to 
devise, implement or properly manage structured and effective systems of
communication for sharing patient information, including in relation to
shift handovers and record-keeping.’

Families of the Stafford Hospital victims and union chiefs called for NHS chief executive Sir David Nicholson to resign

If
the trust is found guilty of the charge of a gross failure to provide 
basic care, it could be fined tens of thousands of pounds.

The
HSE said it was not the first time a hospital trust had been prosecuted
under the law but there have been only a handful of cases.

Although
the proceedings are not being brought against individuals, two of the 
nurses involved face being struck off following professional hearings.

Last
month the Nursing and Midwifery Council ruled that Jeanette Coulson and
Ann King had failed to keep Mrs Astbury’s records up to date or carry 
out blood tests. The panel will decide on a punishment for the two 
nurses over the coming weeks.

Yesterday
Mr Street, 79, said: ‘I am pleased that some action is being taken and I
hope it will give some degree of consolation to other families whose 
loved ones died at Stafford Hospital.’

Maggie
Oldham, chief executive at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust, 
said: ‘We accept the findings of the Health and Safety Executive’s 
investigation. Our thoughts remain with the family of Gillian Astbury 
and we apologise for the appalling care Ms Astbury received at our 
hospital in April 2007.’
