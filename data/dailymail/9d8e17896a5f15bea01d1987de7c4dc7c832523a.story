First responders in New Jersey did not hesitate to smash an SUV's windows when they saw a lifeless infant locked inside the hot car in Hoboken on Thursday.

It was only once the damage was done that the rescue crew realized their mistake: the body inside was no baby, it was just Todd the doll.

'I saw pictures of the doll and it looked real,' Thomas Molta, president of the Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corp., told WABC-TV.

'I got 34 years' experience in EMS and I probably would have broken the window too.'

Spot the baby: EMTs in New Jersey say they only had a split second to save the life of what they thought was a baby trapped inside a hot car

As it turns out, the 'lifeless body' was none other than a doll named Todd, whose 2-year-old owner forgot perched inside her grandmother's car

The owner of the vehicle, Kitty Mieles, says her 2-year-old granddaughter left Todd perched up on a seat. A passerby thought it was a baby and called 911.

When she went back to her car not long after, it was already too late.

‘Oh no, my car!' she said, according to CBS 2. 'When I got there, everything was broken.'

The EMTs have apologized and Hoboken will pay for the the smashed window. 

'The guys that were on the ambulance are 
taking a beating by their coworkers, but it’s all in good fun,' Molta told CBS 2.

'But again, I’d 
rather err on the side of caution,' he added. 'You can replace a window — you can’t 
replace a life.”

The zealous EMTs had good reason to 
exercise caution: every summer, dozens of children are left inside 
sweltering cars across the US and die when temperatures rise.

'Seconds are paramount there, that's the difference between a baby breathing, not breathing, pulse, no pulse,' Molta told WABC-TV.

Some 44 children died inside hot cars last year. So far in 2014, there have been 19 deaths nationwide.

A Kansas father was recently charged with murder after he forgot his 10-month-old foster daughter inside a car for two hours, resulting in her death.

In Texas, a 59-year-old man is also facing criminal charges after he left his 20-month-old granddaughter in a sweltering vehicle for more than six hours. 

And in California, a 37-year-old mother is accused of child endangerment after she left her two toddlers inside a hot car while she gambled. Luckily, the children were rescued in time, unharmed.
