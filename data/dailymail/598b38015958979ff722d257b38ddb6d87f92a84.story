When a father has a hearing aid fitted after years of being deaf, it should be a reason for his son to celebrate.

But it seems Danny Hamilton was left frustrated by the fact his old man can hear again - so he wrote a song to express his feelings.

During the 'affectionate' track, which he wrote for his father as a Christmas gift, the musician complains he can no longer listen to loud music and is forced to maintain a conversation.

Frustrated: Danny Hamilton wrote the 'affectionate' song for his father as a Christmas gift 

Angry: He is annoyed because his father can no longer take his side when he listens to loud music

Mr Hamilton performed the song in front of other members of his family, who laughed all the way through.

He then posted a video of the song on his YouTube page, and has already received more than 700,000 views. 

At one point, the cameraman struggles to hold the camera steady after being overcome by laughter.

And towards the end of the video, the father says: 'That is going to be an Internet classic.'

Underneath the video, Mr Hamilton wrote: 'My Dad, who has been hard of hearing for about as long as I can remember, recently invested in hearing aids. So I wrote him a little song for Christmas to celebrate his newfound sense, affectionately entitled, "I Liked You Better Deaf."

The song goes: 'There used to be a 
time, it was rather recently. When I’d play something on the stereo And 
mother would say “Danny turn that down” and you’d say, “it’s already 
very low”.

'It seemed 
that I could always count on you to come and take my side when I’d set 
the volume up at 62 and someone else wanted it at 35.

'But since you found out that your ears are micable I have to say it’s made you just a touch less likeable.

'You
 never used to know the difference ‘tween the bass and treble clef, and 
it isn’t hard to tell you that I like you better deaf.

'It used to be if I’d run out of anything to say, I could just mumble and you’d usually go away.

'It used to be what I was bringing to the conversation, was subject to a wider range of your interpretation.

'But
 now I see that I must be living in a nightmare, why it’s every son’s 
worst fear to have a dad forever clad with supersonic ears.

And I don’t mean to tell you that I love you any less but there’s no doubt about it that I liked you better deaf.

'If
 I had once forgot to tell you something, say a chord I hadn’t struck 
like, “The mail’s arrived” “I owe you five” “Run away” or “Duck!”

Making peace: When the song finished, the musician closed his laptop and went over to his father

Laughing:At the end of the video, Danny's father said it would be an 'internet classic'

'Once I could have played it off without blood sweat or tears “I told you that,” I’d tell you, and you’d blame it on your ears.

'It once was undetectable but now it’s ineffectual the odds are insurmountable and I am held accountable.

'And you never would’ve noticed if I swore under my breath, now I don’t have to shout to say I liked you better deaf.

'See now I’ve reached a point where it’s hard to make a rhyme, but the song needs another verse to reach a fitting time.

'And if I had been writing it for old deaf dad. I might have left a phrase or two… unfinished.

'But only the best for you and your new hearing, you will find that every rhyme is aurally endearing.

'And I’m afraid that now you’ve left me lyrically bereft but I only need five words to say I liked you better deaf.'
