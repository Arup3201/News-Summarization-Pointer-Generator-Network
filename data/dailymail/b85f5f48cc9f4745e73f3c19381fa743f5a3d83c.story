Video taken at Yellowstone National Park that was meant to show some bison roaming around may show something far more exciting and elusive.

An amateur analyst viewed the footage and is convinced that the video shows as not one, but four bigfoot are heading out for a nice morning walk.

Sadly, the video cuts away before a the creature gets any closer to the camera.

'Or are we witnessing some ancient scene that has been going on for thousands and thousands of years? You decide,' says the YouTuber, who goes by the name ThinkerThunker, according to the Billings Gazette. 

As for the webcam footage, that comes from the good old National parks Service.

Now these could also be cross-country skiers or park employees or grown men in gorilla costumes, but until it is proven as completely false, they could also be bigfoot.

A pack, or flock, of bigfoots.

The creature was captured on webcam video released by the National Park Service

This as almost 100 years after the first reported spotting of a yeti or Sasquatch or Bigfoot, there is still no proof the animals even exist.

And, if they did, breeding would likely be a problem given how few there would be. 

Watch above to determine if this is a bigfoot or a cross-country skier.
