A new advertisement campaign telling men to 'man up, put on an apron' in order to 'give mums a night off' is under fire for pushing an outdated and sexist message.

The intention behind New Zealand Pork's television and Facebook ads appear to have been to send up sexism, stating: 'there are more women in New Zealand's workforce today than ever before but men are still not putting on an apron and doing their share of cooking'.

However it clearly backfired, with social media users taking to Twitter and Facebook to criticise the campaign, dubbing it 'sexist' and an 'embarrassment'.

One of the instruction for a Pork Belly recipe states: 'Throw it in a 170 degree oven and watch a Grand Slam Final of women's tennis (roughly 30 minutes)'

'We reckon it's time more women got out of the kitchen, and more men started to man them. But we know it ain't easy. So we've developed the world's first cooking website designed just for blokes. With a little encouragement, we might be able to get yours to man up and put an apron on before you know it,' the website states.

Recipe names include the likes of 'your big pork balls', with a glossary definition for the words 'recipe book' being 'the thing your wife stands on to reach things'.

One of the instruction for a Pork Belly recipe states: 'Throw it in a 170 degree oven and watch a Grand Slam Final of women's tennis (roughly 30 minutes)' while the other instructions measure time in how long it takes to drink a beer - 15 minutes, according to the ad.

It also features a difficulty metre for recipes, with 'super easy' represented by 'like burping after a beer', and 'challenging' represented by 'like remembering your missus birthday'.

'The 1950s called, they want their gender roles back,' Alex Larsen wrote on the NZ Pork's Facebook page. 

'By the way NZ Pork all the men in whanau cook extremely well so your sexist representation harms both women and men. It's 2015 not 1950!' a Twitter user wrote.

'I actually really like the idea of promoting recipes to men who don't cook but no NZ Pork, no', another person tweeted.

A spokesperson for NZ Pork told Daily Mail Australia that the sexist criticism were only a minority view.

'From the 370 000 people who have been exposed to the campaign we have only received a very small 24 Facebook criticisms that the campaign is sexist, some twitter criticism, one email and a comment from one marketing professor.

'There have been 71 000 video views and continued and increased support of our campaign by the 8339 people who follow the Facebook page. (as at mid-afternoon Tuesday 17.)​'
