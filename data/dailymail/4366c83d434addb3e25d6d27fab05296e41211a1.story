Andre Lake, 27, who was given the 'second chance' at the government department, used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' offices and steal a wallet and two BlackBerry phones

A convicted thief given a job at the Ministry of Justice as part of a rehabilitation programme was jailed for nine months yesterday for stealing from his colleagues.

Andre Lake, 27, who was given the 'second chance' at the government department, used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' offices and steal a wallet and two BlackBerry phones.

He also broke into a store cupboard and stole eight more BlackBerrys, worth Â£125 each.

Nine days later he was sacked and arrested for staging a bomb hoax so he could get the day off work.

Judge Anthony Pitts, sitting at Southwark Crown Court, said: 'What makes it infinitely worse is that from what I have read about you, you are an intelligent and able man who had been given a chance as an ex-offender by the Ministry of Justice which is a very good thing to see.

'Within three months you were using your staff pass to access various parts of the building, using your position and your pass to effect those thefts, that is a serious breach of trust.'

Lake, who at the time was serving a suspended sentence for burglary, was given an 18-month community order with supervision and 200 hours of unpaid work for the bomb scare in November last year.

Although the latest offences came earlier in time the decision to charge him only came recently.

The administration officer in the Youth Justice Office had been employed through the offenders rehabilitation project on June 14, 2010.

He first used his pass to sneak into his co-workers' office on September 22 and stole a wallet containing bank cards, driving licence, and a season ticket.

A few days later he went into a technician's office and stole the two mobiles that were lying on his desk.

Lake made two 999 calls from the office, one claiming there 
was a bomb and the second posing as the building's head of security and 
demanding to know where the emergency services were so he could go home 
early

Then, on October 4, he made his way into the store cupboard and took eight BlackBerrys belonging to the Ministry of Justice.

But managers were able to trace him as 
the culprit on all occasions as he used his personal pass to swipe his 
way into the crime scene.

Referring
 to the store cupboard theft John Keal, prosecuting, said: 'He had 
previously emailed his line manager to say that he would not be 
attending work that day because of Tube strikes but CCTV showed him in 
the office when items were stolen.'

Lake of Harrow, North London, pleaded guilty to the three charges of thefts.

It was his security pass which also identified him as the hoax bomb caller.

On
 October 13 Lake made two 999 calls from the office, one claiming there 
was a bomb and the second posing as the building's head of security and 
demanding to know where the emergency services were so he could go home 
early.

When he was sentenced for that offence Judge Geoffrey Rivlin, QC, told him: 'Idiotically you have thrown away this chance with such a ridiculous prank.'

In August 2009 Lake was given a nine-month sentence suspended for two years after he was convicted of a kicking down the door of a residential property and ransacking it for valuables alongside an accomplice.

The father-to-be was caught leaving the house with a stolen watch and marigold gloves to cover his fingerprints in his pocket but was given a chance by the MoJ.

Judge Pitts said that he was 'nobody's fool' and must have known that the suspended sentence was like a 'sword that's likely to fall' hanging over his head.

'Despite the chance that you were given and despite that sword hanging over your head you went ahead and committed these offences. I have no alternative to pass a sentence of immediate custody,' Judge Pitts said.

Three months of the suspended sentence was activated and Lake was given six-month concurrently for the thefts.
