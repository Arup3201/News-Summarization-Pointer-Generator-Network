The parents of April Jones have each been tattooed with a pink ribbon as a tribute to their missing daughter.

Last week Paul and Coral Jones went to 'friend of the family' and tattoo artist Rob Williams and asked him to create a design incorporating the pink ribbon, which has become a symbol of hope and love adorning the tree-trunks and lamp-posts, shop doorways and homes of Machynlleth, the home town of the five-year-old.

Mr Williams, who runs El Diablo tattoo parlour in the town, has since had requests for a similar tattoo from local people.

Heartfelt: Mr Williams inks the design for a customer. The parents of April Jones had it inked last week

Ink: The tattoos cost a minimum of £35 and are expected to raise more than £900 for the April Fund

Hope: Tattoo artist Mr Williams inks the design on to the arm of community member Rhys Ap Daffydd

Anyone who wants a similar one can get one for a minimum of £35 per tattoo and all the proceeds will be donated to April’s Fund.

The 35-year-old tattoo artist, who has done tattoos for the couple in the past, said: 'When they came in it was very emotional but I gave them both a very special, personalised design, which I will not do for anyone else.

'They have lived around here since I was a lad and a few years ago I lived right by them.

'They did it as a way of permanently remembering April but also of showing that they will never give up searching for her.'

Demand is so strong he has had to enlist help from a tattooist in Bangor. So far he has taken 25 bookings for the tattoo and has made £852 for the appeal, with more to come.

'Local people have been massively shaken by this and I think they see having a tattoo as a permanent way to remember April and show that we are remaining positive,' he added.

Hope: Search teams at work with sniffer dogs on the River Dyfi, Machynlleth, as part of the search for April

As well as professional rescue workers, the town's residents also joined in the huge search effort. April has still not been located

He grew up in the area and has known the family for years. His son goes to the same school as April.

April's Fund has now topped £21,000 with contributions flooding in from all over Ceredigion and beyond.

But the intensive search to find April has still failed despite the efforts of the emergency services and members of the public.

Mark Bridger, 46, who is known to April's family, has been charged with murder, child abduction, and attempting to pervert the course of justice.

The former lifeguard Mark Bridger appeared at Caernarfon Crown Court via video link on October 10 and was remanded in custody until January 11.

April vanished from outside her home as she played with other children in the mid Wales town of Machynlleth on October 1.
