President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle have shared a tender moment when he surprised a group of children during a White House luncheon, in a rare public display of affection.

The First Lady hosted 54 children and their relatives for a 'state dinner' at the White House on Tuesday to celebrate the fact that they won a nationwide competition to create new recipes as a part of her initiative to promote healthy living.

The President was an unannounced guest at the luncheon in the East Room and he seemed very happy to see Michelle.

'I could not be prouder of the work that Michelle has done, her team,' he said after taking the stage and giving her a kiss.

She started off the proverbial love-fest by introducing him as 'a dear, dear man in my life, someone who I love deeply, who is the wind beneath my wings'.

She went on to call him 'just a very awesome world leader' as well.

This is the second time Mrs Obama has held the luncheon in the White House as a part of her Let's Move campaign that promotes nutritious eating and physical activity.

The contest for 8- to 12-year-olds is sponsored by the Epicurious food website and the departments of Agriculture and Education.

It drew a batch of more than 1,300 entries that were whittled to 54 winners - one from each of the 50 states, three territories and the District of Columbia.

Creative titles clearly helped some contestants stand out, like the creators of the Confetti Peanut Ginger Party Pasta which was singled out by the First Lady.

Banana’s Black Bean Burritos, Bring It On Brussels Sprout Wrap and the Pan Seared Mississippi Catfish on a Bed of River Rice were among the other unusual names.

She went on to tell how White House chef Sam Kass could not believe that the Fun Mini-Pizzas with Veggies and Cauliflower Crust were gluten, and he accused his su-chefs of adding wheat to the the dish to make it taste so good.

For his part, the President said that his expertise does not lie in the kitchen.

'Frankly, I'm not a great cook and-- I'm not bad, but I don't do it that much. It’s hard to find the time,' he told the crowd. 

He said that he didn't love vegetables
as a child because boiling would make them 'get all soft and mushy, and
nobody wanted to eat a pea or a Brussels sprout because they tasted 
horrible because they were all mush.'

'Now
I actually like vegetables because they’re prepared right.  And so you 
guys are getting a jump on things because you're figuring that out 
earlier.'

Later, according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Obama fielded questions from student reporters covering the event, including: What’s your favorite food? To which he answered: 'Broccoli.'
