Reese Witherspoon has apologised after being arrested for disorderly conduct, admitting she is 'deeply embarrassed' by the way she behaved.

The Oscar-winning actress released a statement on Sunday 
apologising for her behaviour to police, which began when her husband, 
Hollywood agent Jim Toth, was arrested in the early hours of Friday morning for driving under the influence of alcohol.

After making an appearance at the New York premiere of her new movie Mud on Sunday night, Reese, 37, released a statement explaining: 'I
clearly had one drink too many and I am deeply embarrassed about the 
things I said.

Not her best angle: Mugshots of Reese 
Witherspoon and her husband Jim Toth were both released on Sunday after 
the pair were arrested on Friday night

'It was definitely a scary situation 
and I was frightened for my husband, but that is no excuse. I was 
disrespectful to the officer who was just doing his job.

'The
words I used that night definitely do not reflect who I am. I have 
nothing but respect for the police and I'm very sorry for my behaviour.'

In a state trooper's report from the 
Friday arrest, Witherspoon is quoted as saying to one of the arresting 
officers: 'Do you know my name?'

Tight couple: The actress and husband Jim Toth, spotted leaving their hotel room Sunday, were released on bail early Friday morning

She also said: 'You're about to find out who I am' and 'You're about to be on national news,' according to the report.

Reese said she can't comment further 'out of respect' for the pending case, and her publicist, Meredith O'Sullivan Wasson, offered no other details.

According to a police report released on Sunday, Reese was handcuffed and briefly jailed for refusing to obey orders given to her by an officer of the law.

Toth was apprehended after midnight on Friday for recklessly weaving across Peachtree Street in the city of Atlanta.

The police report alleges that the Hollywood agent smelled of alcohol and appeared 'disheveled'.

After pulling the DUI suspect over, a
sobriety test was conducted in a Walgreens parking lot, with the 
results showing a blood alcohol level of .139 - well above the legal 
limit of 0.08.

Reese is said to have been warned to remain inside her vehicle, while her husband was subjected to the DUI test.

The officer on the scene claims that the actress became clearly agitated and eventually disobeyed his verbal commands.

The officer reported: ‘Mrs. 
Witherspoon began to hang out the window and say that she did not 
believe that I was a real police officer.’

The law enforcer explained in the report: ‘I told Mrs. Witherspoon to sit on her butt and be quiet.’

Critics darling: The film has been well reviewed, especially for Reese's character Juniper

Just keep smiling: Reese was arrested for allegedly disregarding an officer's orders while her husband was handcuffed for failing a sobriety test 

But
once Toth was handcuffed, the mother-of-three disembarked from her 
seat, telling the officer that she was a ‘US citizen’ and that she had 
the right to ‘stand on American ground’.

The report then described how Reese 
resisted him as he grabbed her arms to arrest her. Toth is said to have 
made a verbal attempt to calm his hysterical wife.

The
officer’s report further details: 'Mrs. Witherspoon asked, "Do you know
my name?" I answered, "No, I don’t need to know your name." I then 
added, "Right now." Mrs. Witherspoon stated, "You’re about to find out 
who I am"'

According to the
arresting officer: ‘Mrs. Witherspoon also stated, "You are going to be 
on national news." I advised Mrs. Witherspoon that was fine.’

Toth is said to be facing charges for driving under the influence and failure to stay within his lane while on the road.

While Reese’s alleged violation is ‘disorderly conduct (obstruction)', which falls under municipal ordinance.

Reese and Toth, 42, were released on bail at 3.30am on Friday.

However, according to Variety, the couple are not expected to report to the judge
at their court-ordered appearance and are anticipated to, through their
attorney, request a postponement.

The family is currently residing in Atlanta to shoot Reese’s new movie The Good Lie.

At the Mud event, Reese posed for cameras on the red carpet but did not stop to talk to reporters.

Instead, the actress smiled for the 
cameras as she would under any normal circumstances, looking in good spirits despite her situation.

Reese slimmed up her figure in a loose-fitting black mini dress that drew attention to her toned and trim legs.
