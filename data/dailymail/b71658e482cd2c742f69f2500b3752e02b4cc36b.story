A convicted killer was chosen to promote the new hotel owned by Manchester United heroes Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs, it was revealed today.

Kevin O'Dea, 28, was jailed for seven years in 2008 for the manslaughter of student Sion Hardy.

But after being released from prison after serving half his sentence he is now a model and was picked for promotional work for Neville and Giggs' Hotel Football in Manchester.

A photograph showing him enjoying a beer in its bar across from Old Trafford has now been pulled down from its website.

It appears the millionaire former footballers were unaware he was a killer but the hotel refused to comment today.

Sion's victim's father Robin Hardy, who along with his son is a Manchester United fan, believes it is an insult.

'I guess they must think he's served his time but I'll never forgive him for taking my son away,' he told The Sun.

'He's been released but I feel I have a life sentence'. 

O’Dea, who was 22 and a sports science student, was found guilty of manslaughter at Liverpool Crown Court in May 2008 along with his friend Simon Taylor.

Their victim, Sion, from Bangor, Gwynedd was described as a 'special, unique and happy person' by his family.

He had been at Nation nightclub in Liverpool with friends and was later attacked when he left   after receiving a fatal blow to the neck.

He was attacked as he walked through a nearby underpass where O'Dea and his gang pounced, and the model was described as 'central' to the attack.

The Liverpool University student suffered a brain haemorrhage and was pronounced dead at the Royal Liverpool Hospital.

After the attack, O’Dea and his pals were seen 'celebrating' after the brawl, but despite his protests that he was acting in self-defence it was dismissed by a jury who convicted him in 2008.
