Flats have increased in value more than any other property type over the past decade, with a typical rise of £394 per month, a study has found.

Terraced houses are the second-best performers, while detached homes have seen the smallest percentage increase in their prices, according to Halifax.

Using its own database, Halifax said flat prices had risen by more than a third (35 per cent) on average since 2003, putting them just ahead of terraced homes (32 per cent).

Flats are worth almost £47,500 more than they were a decade ago, with a typical price tag of £180,799.

Halifax put much of the rise down to the strength of the London market, which has a high proportion of flats.

But flats in Scotland have seen the biggest percentage increase in value of anywhere in Britain over the past decade, with a 57 per cent upturn.

London flats have increased in value by 37 per cent, but at more than £286,000, the average price of a flat in the capital is more than double that of a flat in Scotland (£121,000).

Halifax said price growth for detached homes, semi-detached properties and bungalows had been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers.

Flats and terraced homes tend to be particularly popular with first-time buyers, who have recently returned to their market in their strongest numbers since the economic downturn.

The rise has been attributed to the launch of a string of Government measures to improve mortgage availability, such as Funding for Lending and Help to Buy.

Property search website Rightmove reported last month that asking prices for flats had reached an all-time high.

This, it said, was due to growing demand from first-time buyers coupled with high numbers of buy-to-let investors looking for decent returns as the rental market remains strong.

In Wales, terraced homes have increased their value faster than any other property type, recording a 55 per cent rise over the last decade.

The West Midlands and the South East were the only regions where flats or terraces were not the best-performing property types.

Bungalows came out best in the West Midlands, where their value has risen by one third (33 per cent) over the decade.

Semi-detached homes were the best-performers in the South East, recording a 22 per cent rise in value over 10 years.

The value of flats and terraced homes was particularly badly hit between 2007-09, when banks tightened their borrowing criteria amid the economic troubles, making it tougher for first-time buyers to get a mortgage.

During that period, the value of terraced houses and flats fell by around one third following a period of strong growth when low deposit mortgages had been more widely available.

Bungalows and detached homes were best at retaining their value in the couple of years following the price crash as they tend to be less reliant on the first-time buyer market.

But Halifax said that price growth for detached homes, semi-detached properties and bungalows has been constrained in recent years by a lack of home movers.

Detached homes recorded the smallest percentage increase in value over the last decade at 17 per cent, making them worth £286,175 on average.

Bungalows and semi-detached homes have seen their values increase by just under one quarter (24 per cent) over the last 10 years.

Martin Ellis, housing economist at Halifax, said: 'During the recovery since 2009 larger property types such as detached homes, semis and bungalows have under-performed flats and terraces.

'The demand for such properties has been partly constrained by a widespread lack of equity amongst home owners who bought for the first time around the peak in the market.'
