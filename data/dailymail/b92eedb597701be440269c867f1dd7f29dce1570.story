One 15-year old boy with cerebral palsy got a very special Christmas gift this year--the ability to communicate with his family with words for the first time in his entire life.

Raymond Lara, a high school student from Central California, gathered with friends at the American Legion Hall on H street on Monday night to accept his gift of a hands free eye-gaze communication device from the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Raymond suffers from cerebral palsy, a disease that keeps him from speaking, eating anything through his mouth, even swallowing his own saliva, reports the Huffington Post.

Raymond has never said the words, 'I love you.' but his mother can read the emotion in his eyes. 

The machine also relies on the user's eyes in order to create a tool for communicating thoughts and feelings with words---or in the case of the machine, menu choices.

The machine employs imaging technology that creates a computer portrait of the user's eye. After calculating the location of the user's gaze on the computer screen it allows the user to hold his or her gaze on a menu option.

Raymond is able to create words and sentences by holding his point of view on a specific option or menu choice. 

Using the machine has been an extraordinary challenge for Raymond because he suffers from nystagmus, a condition characterized by involuntary eye movement.

The machine operates by locating where the eye is looking. Since Raymond suffers from involuntary eye movements he has had to endure copious amounts of therapy in order to learn how to use the machine properly.

His teacher David Mensch along with others at Centennial High School's Special Education program have helped him control his eye movements enough so that he use the machine to its fullest. 

With practice, Raymond has been able to control his eye movements so that he can use the communication device which relies on taking a digital portrait of his eyes in order to help him communicate verbally

Duane Law, CEO or Kearn Regional Center that assists thousands of disabled residents in Kearn and all over the world spoke highly of the communication technology that is still in development.

'It's an extraordinarily liberating thing, ' said Kern. 'Raymond's family not only believes he can communicate, but that he can communicate everyday.

At one time, Ray couldn't tell his family he needed to go to the bathroom. He couldn't make jokes or express his complex thoughts in a way that his family and others could understand.

Ray cannot read, so for now his use of the machine is with pictures. He can recognize images pertaining to the bathroom, hunger, or thirst. With time, his use of the machine will become mature as he matures.

He's a teen: Raymond's menu options reflect his youthful personality and he can say things like, 'hey pretty lady'

Gifted: Raymond's father thinks the device will help his son to learn and that he may end up to be the next Stephen Hawking

'There are times when something is wrong, and he tries to get our 
attention,' said his mother to the Bakersfield Californian. 'We know he needs something. What we've always 
done is try to guess.'

Unfortunately, after months of learning how to use the communication device, Ray's family cold not afford to pay the $6,000 it would cost to keep the machine

The family tried to get coverage for the machine under their insurance company for over a year but were continuously denied.

The Make-A-Wish Foundation decided to grant Raymond's wish to keep the machine so that he could build relationships with those around him.

'We call it the power of wish' said Catherine Anspach, a spokeswomen for the Make-A-Wish foundation in central California.

Raymond was overcome with joy on Monday night when he unwrapped his eye-gaze machine.

Raymond is 15 years old and his parents say that his menu choices on the machine reflect his youthful energy.

'He's kind of a little flirt,' his mom said, laughing. 'He has one that says, 'Hey, pretty lady.'

'The system will grow with Raymond,' his teacher David Mensch said. 'The more he learns, the more it will grow with him.'

Raymond's father Roman Lara III, greatly supports his son's progress.

'Raymond has a lot of love to share with the world,' he said. 'Who knows, we may have another Stephen Hawking here,' he told the Huffington Post.

His father also can't wait for his son to say things like, 'go Broncos.'

The family keeps a blog to document Raymond's progress called ourlifewithraymond.blogspot.com for those who wish to read more.
