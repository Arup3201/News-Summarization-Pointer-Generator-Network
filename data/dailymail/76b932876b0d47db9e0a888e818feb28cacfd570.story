England physio Gary Lewin is to return home from the World Cup after suffering a fracture and dislocation of his ankle by standing on a water bottle while celebrating Daniel Sturridge's equaliser.

The Three Lions' leveller in the first half of their 2-1 loss to Italy came just moments after Claudio Marchisio had given the Azzurri the lead in their Group D encounter in Manaus.

Sturridge celebrated his close-range strike in his normal style, performing his trademark dance, while Lewin jumped off the bench and injured himself in the process.

'That was a very sad moment for us,' 
said England boss Roy Hodgson.

'In celebrating the goal he jumped up, 
landed on a water bottle and dislocated his ankle.

'It was very 
painful. He was taken to hospital. The doctor set it, put it back in at 
the side of the field, but it's the end of the World Cup for Gary.'

'It's very unfortunate for Gary and us that this accident occurred,' the England manager added.

'We will of course miss him as he's an extremely experienced and popular member of staff.

'However, we wish him a speedy recovery and know he'll be cheering us on from back home.'

Lewin admitted he was sad to be heading home from the tournament.

He said: 'I'm absolutely devastated to be going home. A lot of hard work, planning and preparation has gone into this tournament.

'England has a fantastic backroom staff who will continue to provide excellent support to the players and management.

'I'd like to thank my England colleagues and the FIFA medical officers at the Amazonia Arena for their excellent, professional treatment.

'And of course, I wish the England team all the best for the rest of the tournament.'

Lewin

team's Twitter official feed, @england, swiftly confirming the severity 
of the injury.

'England physio Gary Lewin was injured during 
celebrations for @england's goal," the post said. 'He has dislocated his
 ankle. Get well soon Gary £3Lions'

Former
 Manchester City striker Mario Balotelli went on to net the winner for

Lewin
 was Arsenal first team physio for 22 years and became an England physio
 in 1996 alongside his job at the North London club.

In 2008, he quit the Gunners to take up a Head of Physiotherapy role for the national side.

A
 year earlier, Lewin was credited with possibly saving John Terry's life
 in the League Cup Final after the Chelsea captain swallowed his tounge 
and the then Arsenal physio was first to assist him.

During his time at Arsenal, he was credited with saving striker Eduardo's career after he suffered a horror leg break.

Hodgson’s
 staff haven’t had much luck with injuries – assistant manager Ray 
Lewington is on crutches after emergency knee surgery 24 hours before 
the team’s final friendly against Honduras.
