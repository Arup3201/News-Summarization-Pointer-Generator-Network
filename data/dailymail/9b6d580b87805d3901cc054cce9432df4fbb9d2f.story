Chris Woakes is targeting an extended stay in the England Test side following his successful return to the the fold this summer.

The 25-year-old bowling all-rounder played the final three Tests against India, helping England to win all three and clinch a 3-1 series victory despite having trailed 1-0 after two matches.

Four wickets in the final match at The Oval seemed to justify his selection following two quiet Tests, and Woakes believes he is finally settling into the international fold.

Woakes said: 'I had a taste of Test cricket last summer against Australia and it helped me to improve as a player.

'I did OK last year but I think I have improved as a cricketer in the mean time and come back stronger.

'I have added more pace in my bowling and I think my game has moved up a level to when I first broke into the England team.'

The right-arm fast-medium bowler is highly-regarded within the England set-up, yet he faces stiff competition for places in an ever-evolving line-up. Ben Stokes, Chris Jordan, Liam Plunkett and the once-again selectable Steven Finn are just some of the players vying for a spot in the Test side.

And, with England not playing another Test until they tour the West Indies in March, Woakes may have a little time to wait yet to fully cement his place in the side.

'It is a fresh squad in many ways and I am happy to be a part of it.

'We haven't got a Test for a while now which is a little frustrating but I aim to be involved once they do come back round again.

'Playing for England is what we all aim for as county cricketers. Having been in and out of the squad for few years now it was nice to get a run in the Test team towards the end of the summer.

Delighted: Woakes after the Oval win

'I got myself one or two important wickets - and a few runs here and there - and so I feel pretty good about how I contributed to the side.

'We played some really good cricket as a team and, when you win a Test series, it is a great feeling. Playing Test cricket for England is the pinnacle. I am just delighted I am able to say I was a part of such a fantastic victory in the series against India.'

The Warwickshire bowler - who will feature for the county under their limited-overs name the Birmingham Bears at the NatWest Twenty20 finals day at Edgbaston on Saturday - first appeared on the international scene in the shorter form of the game in January 2011.

And, with 13 ODIs and five international Twenty20s behind him, Woakes is keen to be involved in the one-day side of things over the coming months ahead of the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand next year. 

'It's nice to be included in the squad for the India ODI series, especially with so much one-day cricket coming up in the next year.

'It's a huge achievement to be involved in any international squad so I am very pleased. 

'Obviously I hope to be going to the World Cup in 2015, so there's that little added incentive too.'
