Two Canadian sisters found dead in a Thai hotel room may have died from food poisoning caused by eating blowfish or poisonous mushrooms.

Audrey and Noemi Belanger, aged 20 and 26, were found on Friday, June 15 by a hotel maid, three days after they were last seen while on a night out.

Officials said the sisters were covered in vomit, had skin lesions and were bleeding from their gums. Both women's fingernails and toenails were blue and had blood under them.

Toxic: Thai police suspect Audrey and Noemi Belanger, pictured, may have been the victims of 'serious food poisoning' in Thailand

Dr Komkrit Phukrityakame, Director of Krabi Hospital, said today he had carried out an initial examination, The Phuket News reports. 

He said he suspected the pair had been poisoned, and that the source could have been a meal which included blowfish or poisonous mushrooms.

The popular college students, who were from a small town in Quebec, near the border with Maine, were discovered at the Phi Phi Palm Residence Hotel on the tourist resort island of Phi Phi.

Thai police had previously said they suspected the sisters may have succumbed to 'serious food poisoning.'

Muang Krabi police chief Thaksin Pochakorn said there were no signs of a struggle in their rooms or on their bodies.

Pol Col Thaksin told the Bangkok Post: 'We are waiting for the post-mortem examination of the victims' inner organs to see if there are any traces of toxic substances.'

Lt
Col Rat Somboon, of the Krabi Provincial Police, said he estimated the women had been 
dead for between 12 and 20 hours when their bodies were discovered.

Police
said initial investigations did not indicate
any violence in their hotel room. Investigators have ruled out foul 
play.

Lt Col Jongrak Pimthong said: 'There were neither signs of 
fighting, nor robbery, but we found many kinds of 
over-the-counter-drugs, including ibuprofen, which can cause serious 
effects on the stomach.'

The women, from a well-know family 
the town of Pohenegamook, about 150 miles northeast of Quebec City, had 
checked into the hotel on Tuesday.

Lt Siwa Saneha of Phi Phi Island 
police said: 'They
went out and came back to their room that same night, but stayed in 
their room all day on Wednesday.

'A maid knocked on the door to clean 
the room on Thursday, but there was no response, so the maid thought the
women needed more rest and left.'

He said hotel staff became concerned for their welfare and 
used the master key to enter the room.

Col Somboon said: 'There
was a lot of vomit in the room, and both bodies showed similar signs 
[of trauma].

'They had skin lesions and it seemed that they had bled from
the gums. Also, their fingernails and toenails were blue.

'We will have experts conduct tests on the vomit and urine samples taken from the scene to try to determine the cause of death.'

In a similar case in May 2009, an 
American woman and a Norwegian woman died after suffering severe 
vomiting and dehydration at a Phi Phi guesthouse. The cause of death was
never determined.

Phi Phi Island in the Andaman sea is 500 miles south of Bangkok. The sisters bodies were taken to Krabi Hospital on the Thai mainland before being sent to Bangkok today.

The close knit Canadian community where the sisters came from has been in mourning following their shocking death.

Joanie Ouellet, a former colleague of one of the pair, said on Saturday: 'The mood is quite sad in the town today.'

The sisters’ great-aunt, Colette Belanger, said she heard about the deaths on the news.

'I doubted that it was Audrey and Noemi,' she said.

Blowfish, is extremely poisonous if not prepared properly, but considered a delicacy in Japan and is eaten by thrill-seeking gourmets.

Blowfish poison, called tetrodotoxin, is nearly 100 times more poisonous than potassium cyanide, and can cause death within an hour and a half after consumption.
