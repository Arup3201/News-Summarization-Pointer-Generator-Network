Polish investigators have claimed they found green and rotting meat at an Irish meat processor, according to report.

Th group were in Ireland investigating the horsemeat scandal when they claim they made the discovery.

A report published on a newspaper website said that the chief veterinary officer for Poland compiled a 30-page report after a formal visit by inspectors to Irish plants implicated in the horsemeat scandal.

It states that rotten meat was found at the giant Silvercrest factory in Co. Monaghan.  The report contained photographs of the spoiled meat.

Polish investigators claim, according to the Guardian, it was destined for burgers but must have been unfit for human consumption all along.

‘What I saw was clearly unfit for human consumption. It was part of a bigger consignment but I was told the rest of it had already been used,’ inspector Katarzyna Piskorz said.

‘I asked why the factory managers had not noticed the state of it, but was told they had not seen any problem.’

The Polish report explains how inspectors examined eight pallets of meat from a delivery of 22 pallets that had been destined for burger production.

ABP told the newspaper the meat and its packaging had deteriorated as it had been stored in a refrigerated lorry for three weeks under quarantine conditions – rather than those for meat intended for the food chain.

The meat processor said the meat had deteriorated while being moved and unpacked for testing.

All the meat arriving at the factory had the correct documents on arrival and would have been tested, it said. ABP insisted none of the meat in the consignment had left its plant or entered the food chain.
