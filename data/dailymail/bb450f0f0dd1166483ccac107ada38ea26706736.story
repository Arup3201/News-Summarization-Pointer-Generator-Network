The family of a woman animal keeper mauled to death when a tiger walked through an open door say they still have questions unanswered following the conclusion of an inquest into her death.

Sarah McClay, 24, was pounced on in the keeper's corridor of the tiger house at South Lakes Wild Animal Park in Cumbria before she was dragged by the back of the neck into a den and then to an outside enclosure.

The animal was supposed to never have access to the corridor but male tiger Padang walked straight through a door to where Miss McClay, from Barrow-in-Furness, was as she carried out her cleaning and feeding duties in the house.

An inquest jury in Kendal ruled in a narrative verdict that Padang got to Miss McClay by entering two open internal sliding gates within the house and then an open door that led on to the corridor.

Systems were in place at the park in Dalton-in-Furness in to ensure that animals and keepers remained apart at all times through indoor and outdoor compartments connected by lockable self-closing doors.

But when staff members rushed in after the attack on May 24 last year they found the door to one of the tigers' dens ajar and not locked.

Two internal sliding gates were also open which allowed Padang and his female companion, Alisha, to move in and out of a light den and a dark den to the outside enclosure.

The court heard that a bolt on the top of the dark den door - which had been the one open immediately before the attack - was found to be defective in the hours following her death as the scene was examined but it could not be said if that damage had occurred before the fatality.

An environmental health officer for the local authority told the jury that the top spring-loaded bolt could not be held back and it would bang against the frame when it tried to close, which left a gap of between 20mm and 25mm.

The jury found that one or more of the bolts on that door extended so as to prevent it from closing into the frame.

South Cumbria Ian Coroner told jurors though that their task was not to try and apportion any blame for Miss McClay's death but to determine the facts.

A criminal health and safety at work investigation is being held by Barrow Borough Council which licenses the park.

Following the hearing, Miss McClay's boyfriend, David Shaw, 25, told reporters he had a theory as to why the door to the corridor was open but he said he was not willing to share it at this stage.

In a joint statement issued with Ms McClay's mother Fiona, left, her boyfriend, David Shaw, right, said the family still wanted answers to several questions about how the tiger was able to escape and attack Sarah 

He said: 'We will see how things move forward. We are aware that the council in Barrow is still conducting their investigation and it would be wrong of us to say anything before they have concluded that investigation.

'There are always questions that we would like answered. We know full well that we will not be able to answer some of them ever but there is the chance that some answers may come out in the investigation in time.' 

In a joint statement with Miss McClay's mother, Fiona, Mr Shaw, a systems engineer for British Aerospace, added: 'Sarah's death has been difficult for us all and we hope that today's conclusion will help us move forward in some way.

'While this inquest has been a necessary step and has allowed us to understand some of the events on the day in greater detail, it cannot bring Sarah back to us.

'Our thanks go out to all of Sarah's friends, colleagues and well-wishers who have stood by us and who have offered their emotional strength to us. Your support has helped us through this traumatic time.'

Glasgow-born Miss McClay had worked at the park for more than two years and was well experienced with working with big cats which she saw as a 'privilege'.

Her mother, a 50-year-old housekeeper from Linlithgow, West Lothian, said it was her daughter's 'dream job' after she had visited the park as a child.

The inquest heard that a defective bolt on the door, circled on this scale model, allowed the tiger to escape 

Giving evidence, she also said Miss McClay was 'a meticulous person to the extreme' who did not have any health or money problems.

Mrs McClay said her daughter would not have blamed the tiger for the attack and would not want it to be killed.

Colleagues spoke of her 'bubbly' personality, her passion for the job and her ability to engage with people, especially children.

A post-mortem examination showed among Miss McClay's unsurvivable injuries were deep puncture wounds to the neck, the back of her body, both arms and her left foot.

The jury heard that she was airlifted from the scene to Royal Preston Hospital where she was formally pronounced dead.

He said it 'tore through' the door unhindered and dragged Miss McClay into the den as she let out a scream.

Fellow zoo keeper Emma Els told the hearing that Miss McClay had let her into the tiger house shortly before the attack in the mid-afternoon to grease the internal sliding gates.

But during the routine she ran out of grease and was let out of the tiger's dark den by Miss McClay and then the keeper's entrance.

She said she could not recall whether her colleague shut the door on to the corridor after letting her out.

Mrs Els said the Sumatran tigers were locked outside and in the outside enclosure at the time.

She said it was around 3.45pm feeding time for the big cats but that the Sumatran tigers were on their once-a-week fasting that day.

When she returned to the tiger house she saw people outside and someone had shouted 'the tiger is out', she said.

Her husband, Cornelius, a maintenance worker, rushed to the scene and forced open the entrance door with a crowbar as staff secured the area.

Park owner and founder David Gill, who designed the tiger house, told the jury how he jumped out of a digger 80 yards away and ran towards a fence on the side of the enclosure where he saw the tiger sitting over Miss McClay.

Park visitor Gareth Bell, pictured, said he saw the attack through a viewing window. He told the inquest that the tiger 'tore through the door unhindered' and dragged Ms McClay into his den while she was screaming 

He said he struggled to get a clean shot on Padang and had targeted the top of the animal's shoulder when he fired his rifle and the tiger darted back into the house.

In a statement issued today, Mr Gill said: 'Sarah McClay was a dedicated and valued member of the animal caring staff at the park.

'Her enthusiasm and friendly character were appreciated by everyone she met. Sarah was committed to the aims of the park, to conservation and to preservation of rare species as seen for example in the red squirrel project she helped to develop and run.

'Her tragic and untimely death has affected all of us at the park and she is greatly missed.

'On behalf of myself and everyone at the park I wish to convey our condolences to Mr Shaw, Fiona McClay and all of Sarah's family and friends.'

Shortly after Miss McClay's death, Mr Gill reportedly suggested that it was because of 'keeper mistake' and 'a sad error of judgment'.

Mrs McClay, right, said some of the park owners comments about her daughter's death were 'ill-advised, premature and disrespectful'. She said the comments 'did not give anyone who read it a true picture of Sarah' 

Her family criticised the comments as 'ill-advised, premature and disrepectful' and said it had caused them hurt.

Before Mr Gill was due to give evidence at the inquest, Mrs McClay asked to leave the room.

She explained today that up to that point that only positive comments had been made about her daughter and she was wary that the statement would be brought up and cause those comments to be 'spoilt'.

Asked about Mr Gill's initial statement, she said: 'I thought it was absolutely negative and certainly did not give anyone who read it a true picture of Sarah but I felt that everyone in court this week has done that.'

At the time of the death, Cumbria Police said there was no suggestion of any foul play, suicide or self-harm and they believed it to be due to human or system error, or mechanical failing, or combination of both.
