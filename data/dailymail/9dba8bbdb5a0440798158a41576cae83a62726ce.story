F1 star Jenson Button has revealed the special pink helmet he will wear at the British GP this weekend as a tribute to his late father.

Sunday has been designated ‘Pink For Papa’ day as it marks the McLaren driver’s first trip to Silverstone without his dad John, who passed away in January this year.

John Button played a key role in Jenson’s career, only missing one of his son’s races in 14 seasons prior to his death.

And the McLaren star has is asking fans to show their support by going pink – the colour of John’s traditional ‘lucky’ race-day shirt.

McLaren have created a special T-shirt which supporters can buy, with proceeds going to the Henry Surtees Foundation - an organisation set up by former world champion John Surtees, in memory of his son Henry, which assists and supports people with injuries caused by accidents.

Other stars including Jenson’s model fiancée Jessica Michibata, former World Champion Damon Hill and TV presenters Natalie Pinkman, Simon Lazenby and Lee McKenzie have already shown their support by posing in their pink t-shirts.

Jenson said: ‘This year will be extra special for me, and probably a little more emotional than normal - it’s normally very emotional anyway because of the support, but it will be more so this year,’ said Button.

‘We’re trying to get as many people wearing pink as we can, which is going very well, and I will be wearing a pink helmet, so there will be a lot of pink at Silverstone in support of my old boy.

‘I’m really excited about it, but it is going to be very emotional.’

Unfortunately for Button, approaching his 15th British Grand Prix, the chances of him ending his wretched podium hoodoo are slim.

He is haunted by the fact that not once in 14 previous attempts in his home race as he managed to finish in the top three and soak up the acclaim of an often fervent support.

‘We won’t get on the podium at Silverstone. No chance!’ said a forlorn Button.

‘As it’s my home race I’ll get an extra lift, but it won’t make us go any quicker - I wish it would.’
