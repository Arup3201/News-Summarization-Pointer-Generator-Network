The polar vortex has been blamed for delaying flights and costing the U.S. economy billions in lost business, but the arctic blast has given ice harvesters a head start.

The annual collection of chunks of ice from a New Hampshire lake was able to start nearly a month earlier than previous years thanks to the recent cold snap.

Crews armed with saws and picks collected the blocks on Thursday for a Holderness campsite, which uses the ice as a natural freezer.

Cool idea: The giant ice cubes float in Squam lake before being hooked out

First cut: Carl Hansen uses a custom-built circular saw to cut into the frozen lake

Dig in: The saw cuts through the lake ice, which must be 12in thick for a harvest to take place

Last year the workers couldn't begin sawing the 16in by 19in blocks, each weighing about 160lb, until February 6, because of warm and wet conditions.

The harvest, which has taken place for more than a century, can't begin until ice on Squam Lake in Squaw Cove is 12in thick.

At that point, a team of workers descend on the lake to collect up to 200 tons of ice that will be stored in specially insulated houses that will preserve them until summer.

Using a specially adapted circular saw, the lake is carved into chunks before the crew use ice picks to haul the blocks into trucks.

The giant ice cubes are then driven to the campground, where they are stored in special cabins that prevent them from melting.

Campers at Rockywold-Deephaven Camps will be able to use the blocks to help chill their ice boxes and keep supplies cool during their vacations later this year.
