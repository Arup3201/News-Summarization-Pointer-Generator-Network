Former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton has warned a report that Iran is a year away from being able to build a nuclear bomb may be too optimistic.

In a radio interview today, he said: 'I worry the publicly available information is giving only a very small picture and that Iran is actually even much further along.'

Mr Bolton was speaking on Aaron Klein Investigative Radio on New York’s WABC Radio.

The former ambassador was asked about a statement from a former head of U.N. nuclear inspections claiming Iran is now just a year or so away from having enough enriched uranium to assemble a nuclear bomb.

Olli Heinonen wrote in an article published earlier this week that Iran made this advancement after switching production of its higher-grade enriched uranium to a new, underground site.

Reacting to the one-year timeline, Mr Bolton stated: 'I think it can be even less than that.'

He continued: 'They’ve got, by publicly available information from the International Atomic Energy Agency, enough low-enriched uranium that if enriched up to weapons grade would be enough for four weapons.'

'So they’ve got more work to do, but they are already well on their way,' he said.

Mr Bolton told Klein that 2012 will be a key year to stop Iran’s nuclear program.

'Even Secretary of Defense Panetta said last month that Iran could have a nuclear device within a year,' he argued. 'So they are very close, and obviously if they stepped up their efforts and worked harder, they may well be able to do it before then.

'So this is a clear and present danger,' he continued. 'And I think it’s one of the reasons why you see the tension now in the region and why 2012 is going to be such an important year.'

In his article last week, Heinonen, who was the IAEA's director-general until 2010, said that building a stock of 250 kg of 20 per cent enriched uranium did not mean Iran could deploy a bomb without further engineering work.

Still, he allowed that 20 per cent enriched uranium could within weeks be further purified to the 90 per cent necessary for weapons grade.

Meanwhile, Iran today turned its attention 
towards its Gulf neighbours, warning Saudi Arabia that it would suffer 
consequences if they raised oil output to replace Iranian crude.

Dead: Mostafa Ahmadi Roshan was killed in a magnetic bomb attack

With
the EU contemplating a ban on oil imports from Iran, for their refusal 
to halt nuclear activity, Tehran officials have told several Arab 
countries not to negotiate with the United States and Europe.

The European Union is Iran's second biggest oil customer after China, buying some 450,000 barrels per day of its 2.6 million bpd exports. Its foreign ministers will meet on January 23.

China's
premier was in Saudi Arabia on Sunday probing for greater access to its
huge oil and gas reserves and Britain voiced confidence a once hesitant
EU would soon ban oil imports from Iran.

That follows British Prime Minister David Cameron's visit to the Saudi capital Riyadh where he discussed Iran's position with King Abdullah whilst also requesting an increased output from the Saudi reserves.

Today, Saudi Arabia expressed doubts over Iran's claim it could block the main oil shipping route out of the Gulf and made clear it was ready to pump more oil after sanctions threatened to cut Iranian sales of crude.

Brent crude rose above $111 on concerns about global oil supplies if sanctions freeze OPEC's second biggest producer out of the market or push it towards military conflict, while Saudi Arabia said it would work to stabilise the price at $100.

Saudi Arabia, Iran's main rival for influence in the Middle East which would play a key role in replacing Iranian oil in he event of an embargo, played down Tehran's talk of closing the Strait of Hormuz, the vital shipping lane for Gulf exports.

'I personally do not believe that the Strait, if it were shut, will be shut for any length of time. The world cannot stand for that,' Saudi Arabia's Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi told CNN.  

'I don't think all these pronouncements are helpful to the international oil market or to the price of oil. It's really disturbing.'       

Iran's warning to its Gulf Arab neighbours not to raise oil output to replace its crude appeared to have fallen on deaf ears. Mr Naimi said Riyadh could increase production by about 2 million barrels per day (bpd) 'almost immediately'.

'Our wish and hope is we can stabilise this oil price and keep it at a level around $100,' Mr Naimi said.

Iran has been in turmoil following the
fifth bomb attack in two years that killed 32-year-old Mostafa Ahmad 
Roshan in Tehran last Wednesday.

Ratcheting up the war of words with the West, the Iranians claimed that they have proof that the CIA was behind the killing.

They also sent a ‘letter of condemnation’ to Britain accusing London of having an ‘obvious role’ in the bombing.

Both Britain and the United States have 
condemned the killing of civilians. Israeli officials, in contrast, have
hinted at covert campaigns against Iran without admitting involvement.

It
said that the chain of assassinations began after British intelligence 
chief Sir John Sawers hinted in 2010 at undercover operations against 
the Islamic Republic.

Sir 
John was quoted at the time as saying that intelligence-led initiatives 
were needed to make it more difficult for countries like Iran to develop
nuclear weapons.

He said 
one of the agency’s roles was to investigate efforts by states to build 
atomic warheads in violation of their international legal obligations 
and identify ways to slow down their access to vital materials and 
technology.

Aftermath: The killing has sparked outrage in 
Iran, and state TV broadcast footage Saturday of hundreds of students 
marching in Tehran

The letter said the killing of 
Iranian nuclear scientists had ‘started exactly after the British 
official John Sawers declared the beginning of intelligence operations 
against Iran.’

The Iranian Foreign Ministry handed a
letter claiming it had evidence the US plotted the scientist’s death to
the Swiss Ambassador in Tehran.

Switzerland
has represented American interests in Iran since relations were broken 
off with Washington shortly after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

‘We
have reliable documents and evidence that this terrorist act was 
planned, guided and supported by the CIA,’ said the note, according to 
Iran’s state media.

Tehran 
has urged the United Nations Security Council to condemn the latest 
killing, claiming it was carried out to undermine its nuclear ambitions.

General
Masoud Jazayeri, spokesman for Iran’s Joint Armed Forces Staff, said: 
‘The enemies of the Iranian nation, especially the United States, 
Britain and the Zionist regime, or Israel, have to be held responsible 
for their activities.’

On a mission: U.S. Army General Martin Dempsey will head to Israel for discussions

While the Iranians insist they are 
merely trying to harness nuclear power for energy uses, the West and 
Israel says Tehran wants to build bombs.

Iran has threatened to close off the 
key oil shipping route through the Strait of Hormuz if new sanctions are
imposed on its lifeblood oil exports.

Britain and other western powers have vowed to take military action to keep the channel open.

Senior
U.S. military officials said mine-sweeping dolphins would be the first 
line of offence if Iran carried out its threat to choke off the Strait.

The
Navy-trained dolphins would be used to identify Iranian mines, 
according to retired Admiral Tim Keating, former commander of the US 5th
Fleet in Bahrain.

In talks: President Obama, left, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, discussed the Iran situation via telephone

The
top U.S. military commander is scheduled for talks in Israel this week 
at a time when the U.S. is concerned that Israel might be preparing to 
attack Iran over its nuclear program.

The Israeli Defence Ministry 
confirmed the planned visit Thursday by Army General Martin Dempsey, the
chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. It did not give his agenda 
for talks with Israelis - but Iran is expected to be at the top.

Israel considers a nuclear-armed Iran
to be an existential threat because of its nuclear program, missile 
capabilities, support for anti-Israel militants in Lebanon and Gaza and 
frequent references by its president to the destruction of Israel.

Israel has repeatedly hinted it might take military action if international sanctions fail to stop Iran's nuclear development.

The
U.S., Israel and other Western nations believe Iran is developing 
atomic weapons. Tehran insists its nuclear program is for peaceful 
purposes.

Gen Dempsey's visit will be his first official trip to Israel since he assumed command of the joint chiefs on September 30. His predecessor, Admiral Mike Mullen, made several visits to Israel during his four-year term.

On Thursday President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu discussed the Iran situation in a telephone conversation.

The Obama administration is concerned that Iran's recent claim that it is expanding nuclear operations with more advanced equipment may push Israel closer to a strike.

The U.S. still hopes that international pressure will persuade Iran to back down, but the Islamic regime shows no sign it would willingly give up a project that has become a point of national pride.

The U.S. has led a series of economic sanctions against the regime. On Sunday, Israeli Cabinet Minister Moshe Yaalon said he was disappointed that the U.S. has not expanded the measures to further damage Iran's central bank and its energy industry.
