Experts have discovered that Mount Snowdon is a whole metre taller than originally thought.

Three ramblers, John Barnard, Graham Jackson and Myrddyn Phillips, have remeasured the UK's second tallest mountain using state-of-the art GPS technology and found it actually stands at 1,086m and not 1,085m as recognised by the Ordnance Survey (OS).

However, the OS will not be altering their maps as the natural summit of the Welsh peak is still 1,085m, although a man-made plinth that was erected in 2009 to mark the top added an extra metre.

Mount Snowdon is the second tallest mountain in the United Kingdom and three ramblers have learned that it is, in fact, a metre higher than recorded by the Ordnance Survey

Graham Jackson and John Barnard (second right and right), pictured with two other ramblers, measured Mount Snowdon and found that it is actually a metre higher than the Ordnance Survey records

The addition means that the 400,000 hill-walkers who ascend Snowdon every year physically climb 1,086m to reach the top and not 1,085m.

Mr Hughes, 53, said: 'Our survey of Snowdon accumulated six hours of data which was later post-processed using Ordnance Survey state of the art software, which gave a result of 1085.67m, which is rounded up to 1,086m.

John Barnard (right) switches on the Leica GS15 to gather the first of two sets of three hours of data needed to measure the exact height of Mount Snowdon

'This result means that the highest part of the natural summit tor which is now buried under the summit plinth is approximately 1084.8m high or 1.085m.

'So although the natural bedrock and the Ordnance Survey map height of 1085m will remain the same, it means that all those thousands of hill walkers who struggle up what they think is a mountain of 1085m in height are in affect climbing one extra metre and arriving at the top of Snowdon peering out on a land that is 1086m below them.'

Mr Barnard and Mr Jackson are retired research chemists from Mold, North Wales, and Cheshire respectively, and Mr Hughes is a former manager at a printing firm and lives near Shrewsbury.

They have measured more than 150 hills in England, Scotland and Wales since 2008 and have elevated two hills to mountain status, which in England and Wales is classed as 2,000ft.

In 2008 they measured Mynydd Graig Goch in Snowdonia at 2,000ft and six inches - up from 1,998ft.

In 2013 they upgraded Thack Moor in the Cumbrian Penines from 1,998ft to 2,000ft.

There is no precise international definition of what constitutes a mountain. The Ordnance Survey accepts local tradition and names. However, it is generally agreed that the minimum height is 2,000ft (610m).

When Sir George Everest measured Mount Everest, he found it was exactly 29,000ft high but he thought that no one would believe him so he recorded it as 29,002ft. Various subsequent measurings now have the mountain listed as 29,035ft high.

Snowdon is one metre taller than recognised by the Ordnance Survey (OS)

The extra metre is caused by a man-made plinth installed in 2009

OS will not be changing records because natural summit is still same

They have elevated two hills up to mountain status
