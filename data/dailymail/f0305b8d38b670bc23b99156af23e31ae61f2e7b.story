Schools would open until 6pm for up to 45 weeks a year under plans drawn up by David Cameron’s former Number Ten policy chief.

Paul Kirby suggests long summer holidays and short working days for teachers should be scrapped.

Under the highly controversial scheme, which would enrage teaching unions, the average school day would run from 9am to 6pm, while school holidays would be slashed to seven weeks.

However, government sources last night played down the prospects of the idea ever being adopted.

Academies and free schools have had the flexibility to alter their school day and term length, including working longer hour, for years. But few have taken up the opportunity.

A Government source said ministers were keen for more schools to experiment with different hours, but said Mr Kirby’s call for a compulsory 45-hour week went ‘well beyond’ anything being considered.

Schools already have the freedom to set their own term dates and vary the length of days, which could signal the end of the long summer holidays for thousands of children.

Mr Kirby told The Sun his proposals would ‘transform the lives of most households in the UK within two years’.

Nine-hour school days would slash childcare costs for parents and boost education standards, it was claimed.

A Government source said ministers are very keen to see schools experiment with their hours, but added Mr Kirby's proposals go 'well beyond' that. A spokesman for the Department of Education said they are open to consider new ideas for further reform

Pupils would also be better prepared for work as they would become used to the long hours and it would keep them off the streets.   

Mr Kirby, who left Downing Street a year
 ago to return full-time to accountancy firm KPMG, added: ‘This is a 
once in a generation reset that wouldn’t detract from the current school
 freedom agenda. It also involves dramatically expanding what schools 
actually do — into sport and other activities.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the Chief Inspector of Schools, said the six-week summer holiday is too long

‘All the lessons from abroad where this has happened previously, such as the United States, show that elongating the school day takes much of the stress away from teachers and pupils.’

Last year teachers demanded a 20-hour a week limit on classes so they could maintain a healthy ‘work/life balance’.

Union members called for a rigid 35-hour week, with little more than half given over to teaching children.

But just last month Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector of schools, said the six week summer holiday was too long.

It is thought that reducing the Christmas, Easter and summer holidays to little more than two weeks each would save the government money by reducing the number of claims for child tax credits.

It could also net hundreds of millions more income tax from mothers able to go back to work,

A Department for Education spokesperson said last night: ‘We are already giving all schools the freedom to set the length of the school day and term.

'Many Academies and Free Schools offer extended opening hours, and we want more schools to take up these freedoms. We will obviously consider recommendations for further reforms.’
