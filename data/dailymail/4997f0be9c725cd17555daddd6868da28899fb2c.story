Leicester City's proposed deal for Marseille defender Rod Fanni, 32, has fallen through after he failed to agree personal terms. 

The France international had been training with the Foxes to establish his fitness after being allowed to leave Marseille for a small fee.

The 32-year-old has been linked with moves to England for the past four years and Leicester wanted an experienced defender to cover for Matt Upson's injury.

Manager Nigel Pearson is looking at Pablo Alvarez, 30, of Catania. He also hopes to conclude a two year deal for Argentine midfielder Esteban Cambiasso, 34.

Cambiasso, who turned 34 on Monday, also has interest from Sevilla. 

Meanwhile, Leicester have rewarded striker Jamie Vardy with a new four-year contract tying him to the Premier League newcomers until June 2018.

The 27-year-old joined Leicester in the summer of 2012 from Fleetwood Town and has netted 21 times in 70 appearances for the club, including 16 goals last term as the Foxes won the Championship title.

Vardy, who was named Players’ Player of the Year by his Leicester team-mates last season, told Leicester's official website: 'I’m over the moon.'
