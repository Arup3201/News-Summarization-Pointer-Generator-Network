It is hard to imagine a more impressive setting for an apartment. Wardour Castle is a very grand Palladian mansion surrounded by 40 emerald-green acres in a quiet corner of rural Wiltshire. Driving along country lanes from the nearby village of Tisbury, you could believe you have travelled back in time to a previous century.

Wardour is one of the many country mansions that have been divided into apartments, but what’s unusual for a building of this size is that there are just ten apartments.

Two of them – by far the largest and most spectacular – are owned by designer Jasper Conran, son of Habitat founder Sir Terence Conran. Within his central apartment, which covers the ground and first floor, where the grand public rooms used to be, is the centrepiece of the house, a curved staircase rising  60ft to a dramatic decorated rotunda with circular skylight.

The castle was built in 1776 by Lord Arundell, whose family had owned the previous Old Wardour Castle, now a romantic ruin a mile away, since 1547.

The family lived in the ‘new’ castle until the 16th Lord Arundell died without an heir during the Second World War.

After a period of neglect, the mansion became a girls’ school but suffered inglorious extensions in the 1960s, and a tennis court was built on the Great Terrace.

It was eventually sold to a developer in the 1990s, who got rid of the extensions, did a great deal of restoration work and turned the mansion into elegant apartments with the help of architect John Pawson.

Fans of the film Billy Elliot will have seen some of Wardour’s interior, as it was used during filming as the dance school.

The apartments are all completely different shapes and sizes, but their generous square footage means  that little of the grandeur of the original building is lost.

Artist Helen Cowcher and photographer Paul Wakefield bought one of the three top-floor apartments 14 years ago.

They were living in South London but wanted somewhere peaceful they could escape to at weekends. They knew someone who lived nearby who told them there was an apartment for sale in the castle.

‘We got very excited as soon as we saw it,’ says Helen. ‘It’s the most amazing building. As soon as you walk into the hallway downstairs, you get this fantastic feeling of space – you know that you’re in a mansion.’ Space, style and light are what strike you most about Helen and Paul’s three-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment.

The lofty ceilings, beautiful sash windows with deep recesses revealing the thickness of the walls, wide doorways, timber flooring and white walls create an elegant backdrop for Helen’s paintings and Paul’s photographs.

‘The building is Grade I listed so you can’t do anything structural, but you can decorate as you like,’ says Helen.

‘We prefer white walls and ceilings so nothing gets in the way of the architecture.’

They have added colour and texture with bright cushions, 1950s ceramic lamps and quirky objects they have collected from all over the world.

The sitting room is a generous  28ft 
by 25ft, big enough for five sofas and flooded with light from four 
windows, two on opposite sides of the room. The dining room next door is
also 28ft long, though narrower, but there is more than enough space 
for the huge rustic wooden table that could seat ten guests.

All
the rooms have the most mesmerising views of the idyllic parkland and 
Wiltshire hills and farmland beyond.

From the master bedroom you can 
take in the whole bucolic scene without even getting out of bed, as you 
can from the roll-top bath in the spacious en suite.

‘We
have loved it here. It’s a great place for entertaining, and the 
history is a big part of it for us,’ says Paul. They have bumped into 
some of the women who were at school here, and have even met a woman who
used to ride her pony inside the house when it was empty.

‘It’s
also ideal because we can just come and enjoy the countryside without 
having to worry about the garden or maintenance,’ adds Paul. ‘With 40 
acres, there’s no need for a garden.’

Helen,
61, and Paul, 63, have decided to sell both their London house and the 
castle apartment to buy a bigger place in the area, where Helen can have
a studio.

The apartment is on the market for £695,000 with a 170-year lease. ‘It’s very quiet here because the walls are so thick that you’re not aware of anyone else in the building,’ says Paul. ‘People like their privacy but everyone  here is very friendly.’

And what about their famous neighbour Jasper Conran? ‘He’s friendly and he has a good sense of humour,’ says Helen. ‘And of course he has impeccable taste .  .  .’
