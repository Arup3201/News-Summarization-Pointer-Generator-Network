This is the shocking moment a woman was filmed hurling 'racist' abuse at two men on the London Underground and saying 'you can only speak in English while you're on my train'.

Passengers said the woman took offence after hearing the men speaking in an Eastern European language and accused them  of  only using English to 'get something' in an expletive-laden tirade.

She was filmed last night saying: 'You know English when you want a job. You know English when you want a flat. You know English when you want f***ing anything. 

'But when you want to try and talk about us on the train you talk in your own lingo.'

A woman was filmed hurling 'racist' abuse at two men on the London Underground and saying 'you can only speak in English while you're on my train'

Jay, 24, who works in banking, captured the  'racist tirade' at around 11pm yesterday on the District Line between Mile End and Plaistow on his way home from the England match at Wembley. 

He said: 'It was a total shock to witness this racist abuse. You really don't expect to see it in this day and age.

'The woman overhead them speaking in another language and then started aggressively ranting at them. Everyone in the carriage was absolutely shocked.'

Wearing a black leather jacket and dark trousers, the blonde woman first confronted the two men saying: 'Don't f***ing sit on my train and speak about me behind my back in your lingo. 

'Do it to my face. I really ain't f***ing  shy. I don’t know what you’re talking about because you’re doing in behind my back.

Onlookers were heard calling the woman a 'bigot' and saying 'you are disgusting' during the heated exchange

'You want to a job, you want to live in our houses do it, but speak in English while you’re on the train. Nah you don’t have the b******s.'

One of the men responded saying: 'You don’t even know what I was talking about.' 

'If you want to argue with someone you have to listen to what they’re saying. Not everyone in here is speaking English.'

Both men then got off the Tube and the woman said: 'Go away, goodbye. Go and sponge some more off the social.'

Onlookers were heard calling the woman a 'bigot' and saying 'you are disgusting' during the heated exchange. 

One commuter intervened in the confrontation and was seen shouting at the woman before getting off the carriage.

The British Transport Police has been notified about the incident.
