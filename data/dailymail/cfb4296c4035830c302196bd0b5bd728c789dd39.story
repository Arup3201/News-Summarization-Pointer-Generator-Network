An adorable video of a concerned baby crying along with his father is bound to warm the cockles of your heart.

Featured in the clip, the baby named Aris initially appears quite content as he sits on his dad’s lap and listens along to him addressing the camera.

His dad states: ‘I just had to get it on video so you could see that Aris is a natural sweetheart.’

So far so good: Baby Aris initially appears quite content sitting on his dad's lap, listening to him address the camera

Adding: ‘Anytime he sees me crying it makes him want to cry too.’

Getting the experiment under way, the dad mimics the sound of a cry and immediately the six-month-old baby reacts with a look of concern while shaking his head.

Gazing up at his dad, Aris then proceeds to cry along with him until the pair stop in unison as if nothing ever happened.

Mimicking tears, the dad influences the concerned six-month-old to cry along with him and produce actual tears

Testing his theory twice more, the dad once again turns on the taps and without fail little Aris scrunches up his face and begins bawling.

Looking at his dad for reassurance, Aris momentarily settles down before crying with his dad for one last time.

Shedding visible tears, Aris’ wailing becomes increasingly louder until his dad puts a halt on the proceedings and gives his son a kiss.

The adorable video, which appears to have been staged at the family’s house, was filmed in Kaufman County, Texas.
