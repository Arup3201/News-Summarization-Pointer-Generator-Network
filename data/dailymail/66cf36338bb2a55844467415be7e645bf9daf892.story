Teenage anorexics are being put at risk because supermarkets are handing over powerful laxatives without any restrictions or age controls, it is claimed.

Concerns about the sale of the medicines to youngsters who are dangerously thin and ill were first raised by the eating disorder charity Beat five years ago.

However, an undercover survey involving 14-year-old actors found leading supermarkets – Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Boots – continue to dish out laxatives without asking questions. 

Concern: There are fears that many teenagers are abusing laxatives to aid weight loss 

The footage will be shown on BBC1’s Watchdog at 8pm tonight.

Beat is calling for a change in the law or voluntary measures by stores to ban laxative sales to under-16s.

The group also wants the maximum pack size reduced to ten tablets with sales restricted to pharmacies and a warning label that reads: ‘this is not a weight loss product’.

The charity’s chief executive, Susan Ringwood, said there is evidence that an increasing number of youngsters are using laxatives as part of their drastic weight loss regimes.

She said: ‘We have seen a 30 per cent increase in calls to our helplines over the last year where people have mentioned overusing laxatives in unhealthy way. And that does include a significant number of young people as well.’

Medical experts warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and electrolyte imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. It can also damage the liver and potentially damage the heart leading to heart failure and death.

The BBC Watchdog programme sent a group of 14-year-olds into 25 high street stores to purchase three boxes of stimulant laxatives. They were never stopped or questioned by staff, despite buying a minimum of 60 tablets each time.

The programme features Carolyn Jones, whose daughter Sarah, aged 15, has been anorexic for two years. The teenager was rushed to hospital in January this year after an overdose of laxatives.

Mrs Jones, from Liverpool, said: ‘It was one evening, she’d not long gone to bed and she shouted she didn’t feel very well with pains in her stomach.

‘She got rushed into the local hospital and after we realised she’d overdosed on laxatives. She took at least 20 in one go.

Her blood pressure dropped. Her heart rate dropped. She became so dehydrated that in the morning she stood up and just collapsed.

‘I didn’t realise that children or young people would get hold of laxatives to take them to lose weight. I didn’t realise they’d even think of doing something like that.

‘It turns out she was actually going out in her lunch hour, even before school and after school, in her uniform to the local Tesco supermarket and picking them up off the shelf, paying for them and walking out, no-one bats an eyelid.’

She added: ‘Sarah is now recovering but I am constantly scared that she can just as easily go into any store and buy as many laxatives as she likes.’

Seventeen-year-old Lottie Hall, from Hertfordshire, tells the programme she started taking stimulant laxatives to help her lose weight when she was just 13 and now suffers long term damage.

‘At first it would start with just a few, four or five. Over time my body just got used to it and I found that I had to have more and more. So in the end I could be taking 20, 30 a day to get them to have the desired effect,’ she said.

‘It was a long time, probably about three years before my parents found out and I started getting help for it.’

The sale of drugs is policed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which said it has no plans to restrict laxative sales but it will put stronger warnings on packets.

A spokesman said: ‘Abuse of laxatives by people suffering from eating disorders is sustained over a long period of time.

'While reducing the pack size will minimise the quantity of product accessed in one transaction it will not prevent a person who is determined to abuse these products from purchasing multiple packs by visiting different sales outlets and via different internet pharmacies in this country and abroad.’

However, the MHRA said there are plans to have stronger warnings on packs stressing that laxatives do not aid weight loss and that taking them regularly for a long time is harmful. 

All the retailers said they abide by existing regulations on sales, were aware of the concerns and willing to follow any new regulations the Government brings in.

Boots said they would be happy to work on developing new controls. A spokesman said: ‘On an issue like this it’s important that manufacturers, retailers and regulatory bodies work together to look at how to respond and we would welcome being involved in a wider conversation on this topic to understand what further action could be agreed.’

Sainsbury’s said staff are being advised to look out for customers who are bulk buying laxatives. Asda said it would comply with any request from the government to restrict sales.

Morrisons said it could be helpful if the government developed new regulations to control sales.

Watchdog airs tonight at 9pm on BBC One.
