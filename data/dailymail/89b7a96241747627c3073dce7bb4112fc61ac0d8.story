A grateful Air Force wife has bought groceries for a group of firefighters after they were forced to abandon their full cart at the register to respond to an emergency call.

The anonymous donor shelled out $123.25 for the firefighters' items, including bread rolls, peppers, mushrooms and bacon, at Costco in Vacaville, California on Sunday.

'Thanks for being there for us!' she penned on the note attached to the groceries. 'Have a good weekend! From = Air Force wife.'

Kindness of strangers: A woman anonymously bought firefighters' groceries after they abandoned their cart to respond to a call on Sunday. When they returned, they found this note attached to the items

The firefighters, who were wearing camouflage shirts for Memorial Day, were stunned by her generosity - especially at a time when they were paying tribute to veterans, like her husband.

The team discovered her act of kindness after they responded to the call and returned to find the cart of groceries had been covered. They took to Facebook to thank the good Samaritan.

'Whoever did this, we are forever grateful and your kind gesture will not be forgotten,' they posted. 'Meals at the firehouse come out of our own pockets and this was beyond generous.'

The Facebook post has been liked more than 6,000 times and shared nearly 1,000 times, with hundreds of people commenting about how they were touched by the act of kindness.

Thankful: The firefighters were wearing these camouflage shirts at the time to honor Memorial Day

Shock: Battalion chief Jeff Ryder said the team planned to pay it forward by hosting a veteran to dinner

Battalion Chief Jeff Ryder said the men were overwhelmed by the gesture.

'During Memorial Day weekend when we should be honoring the military members and their wives and here she is honoring us as firefighters,' he told CBS Sacramento.

The firefighters pay $25 each per shift for meals, but they told KTVU they're going to use the money the woman saved them to pay her act of kindness forward.

'Later that day, the crew was at Lucky's,' Ryder said. 'There was an older couple behind them buying flowers appeared to be for Memorial Day, and the crew took some of that money and bought the flowers for them.'

They also had plans to host a 90-year-old World War II veteran for dinner on Tuesday.

Ryder added that they do not know who the mystery woman is, but if she wishes to come forward, they would like to thank her in person.
