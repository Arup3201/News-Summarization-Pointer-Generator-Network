The BBC's Adrian van Klaveren claimed almost £400 when his holiday was cancelled in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal

A senior BBC executive who earns a six-figure salary claimed almost £400 when his holiday was cancelled in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile sex abuse scandal.

Adrian Van Klaveren, who in June 2012 had a total remuneration of £193,150, claimed £387.50 for a 'Cancelled holiday to return to work during Jimmy Savile issue'.

A former controller of BBC Radio 5 Live, Van Klaveren left the station in December in the wake of the Pollard Report into aspects of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

He had temporarily headed the chain of command in news at the time of a bungled BBC2 Newsnight report into child abuse in north Wales, which led to Lord McAlpine mistakenly being linked to it.

It led to the BBC making a financial settlement with the Tory peer.

He is now in charge of the BBC coverage of the 100th anniversary of the First World War.

The expenses claims, which were published today, also reveal that current head of television Danny Cohen was given a box of win at Christmas by Mrs Merton star Caroline Aherne.

Cohen, who at that time was BBC One controller, gave the wine to staff at the station.

The total expenses claimed by senior BBC staff has actually risen by almost a fifth compared to this time last year.

New figures show the expenses bill of £206,401 for the latest quarter for which figures are available, had gone up by 19 per cent, compared with the equivalent period a year earlier which accounted for £174,041.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'The majority of these expenses are unavoidable routine costs incurred in running a major international broadcasting organisation.

'Whilst there will inevitably be fluctuation in spend from year to year we are mindful that we are spending public money and are working hard to keep these costs to a minimum.'

The corporation has been publishing quarterly expenses for all senior managers who earn more than £150,000 in a bid to increase transparency.

The rail bill has dropped by 21 per cent in a year, and internal hospitality has decreased by 22 per cent in the same period.

A BBC spokeswoman said: 'Due to a leading editorial role dealing with exceptional circumstances Adrian was required to return early from annual leave.'

The figures, which cover the last three months of last year, show that taxi fares claimed by senior bosses have also risen by 19 per cent year on year, totalling £32,948 for the period covered by the latest expenses disclosure.
