A desperate woman tried to smuggle her baby past airport security in Papua New Guinea in a backpack, as she did not correct immigration papers for her son to leave the Philippines. 

The two-month-old was discovered by shocked staff at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, as he was picked up by the X-ray machine.

According to ABS-CBN News, the child was soundly asleep when he was found by security at NAIA Terminal 1.

The mother was identified at nursing graduate, Jennifer Pavolaurea, 25, who was departing for Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea on an Air Niugini flight. 

The assistant general manager for security and emergency services of the airport, Vicente L. Guerzon Jr, said the woman had been detained for questioning and admitted the lack of clearance papers for the child. 

The single mother and her son were eventually allowed to leave the airport and no charges were filed.  

The single mother, 25, reportedly did not have immigration papers for her son to travel to Papua New Guinea from the Philippines

This is not the first time a baby has been hidden in a bag in an attempt to be smuggled on a plane. 

In 2012 an Egyptian couple arrived at Sharjah International Airport in Egypt without the correct immigration papers. 

They were told they would be held in the airport for a few days, so decided to risk their chances and put their child in a bag. 

This Egyptian couple also attempted to sneak their baby through customs in a bag at Sharjah International Airport in 2012
