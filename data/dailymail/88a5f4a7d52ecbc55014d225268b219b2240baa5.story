Mr Johns, who was born Michael John Lee, was very close with his mother Janet and stepfather John, who was the father figure in Mr Johns' life.

Janet and John Burke both still live in Perth but visited their son frequently, including a surprise trip to Michael's home last year.

At the time, Michael expressed his delight that his mother and  stepfather had 'turned up unannounced on his doorstep'.

In a 2008 interview Johns spoke affectionately about his musical upbringing in Australia with his mother, stepfather and siblings, Cindy and Stephen.

'Everyone in my family is musical. My mum has a very pretty Doris Day-type voice,' he said.

'My brother and sister both play piano and sing. My stepfather is a great singer too. I was always around music growing up.'

Stepbrother Alan Burke took to social media to pay tribute to Mr Johns on Sunday.

'Michael, our brother. I can't believe that you are gone,' he wrote on Facebook.

'I am still in shock and feel totally gutted right now. I can't believe we won't ever hear that golden voice of yours again. You and I were bonded with music and I cherished that and I'm going to miss that. RIP my brother.'
