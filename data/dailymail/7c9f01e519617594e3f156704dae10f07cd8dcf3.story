It's tough being a leading advocate for healthy eating when you’re also one of the world’s favourite celebrity chefs.

But Jamie Oliver appeared to be practising what he preaches during a trip to Australia.

His new slimmed-down look was in stark contrast to the rather portly figure he cut six months earlier when he was spotted in London.

The difference was emphasised by the fact he wore the same clothes on both occasions.

Back in September, his short-sleeved shirt seemed stretched at the midriff as he strolled through the capital in trendy Birkenstock sandals.

But in Sydney yesterday, his stomach appeared washboard flat. There was also less evidence of a double chin.

He was filming an episode of a cooking special on the steps of the Sydney Opera House, two days after stopping in Perth to visit the most successful restaurant of his international Jamie’s Italian chain.

Jamie has been freinds with Tobie Puttock, who appears with him in the new show, for 15 years

Oliver, 38, has campaigned for people to use fresh food and eat sensibly. He has also criticised the government for not doing enough to tackle obesity.

But he has struggled with his weight in the past - and is a little touchy on the subject.

Two years ago - during another visit to Australia - he bristled when asked by a female reporter if he had put on a few pounds, calling her a b****.

The father-of-four, who is worth £150 million, said at the time he tried to watch his weight and worked out twice a week but admitted there was room for improvement.

He added: ‘I do my best. Working in the food business is quite hard when someone is constantly asking you to try things.

‘I eat fresh. I train twice a week. I could definitely do better but I am trying to do my best like most people when they hit 30.’
