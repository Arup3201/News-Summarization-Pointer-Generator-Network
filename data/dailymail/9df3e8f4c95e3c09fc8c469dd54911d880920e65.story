Public scandals and White House security breeches have revealed a decline in the Secret Service after the agency spent decades  as the gold-standard in law enforcement world.

Now, former  agents and former leaders charged with overseeing the agency are hitting back - saying the Secret Service has been the victim of demands protect more people and accomplish more - all while the budget has remained flat or been cut. 

Some lawmakers aren't buying this excuse and saying the Secret Service has been unaccountable for years and that leaders in the agency don't have the proper oversight. 

Battered: The Secret Service has come under increasing criticism for security lapses in gaffes in recent years

The Washington Post reports that on September 11, 2001, the Secret Service was charged with protecting  18 people, including President George W. Bush, his immediate family and the vice-president and his immediate family. 

After the attacks, Bush ordered the agency to begin protecting his extended family, including his four brothers and sister, and Vice President Dick Cheney's adult daughters and his grandchildren.

President Barack Obama has largely continued that trend and currently. The Secret Service is in charge of protecting 27 people, including Vice President Joe Biden's school-age granddaughters and Obama's closest adviser, Valerie Jarrett, the Post reports.  

Each person requires two to six agents to protect them at a time and the agents work in two to three daily shifts for round-the-clock cover.

The Secret Service says it needs 1,420 Uniform Division officers to protect the White House, currently, it say only has 1,320, the Post says.

Even as the responsibilities have expanded, the staff of the Secret Service has stayed the same. A wave of early retirements from the 1990s to 2002 meant that 925 senior agents left the agency while they were still in their productive years, the Post reports.

All this has culminated in shocking shortcomings in protecting the president and the White House. Offices from the uniform branch of the Secret Service, which guards the White House, told the Post they are often called in to work overtime on their days off because of a shortage of staff.

The agency has also canceled regular training sessions that keep officers current because the Secret Service can't afford to take them away from their jobs. 

Additionally, because of a shortfall in funds, the agency decided to cancel all but three of its academy training classes - leading to a shortfall of new recruits, according to the Post.  

The Secret Service is also in charge of catching counterfeiters. Since 9/11, the agency was given the task of tracking online threats against financial institutions - further expanding their portfolio. 

It has also picked up responsibilities of monitoring large crowds at sports arenas and other events for possible terrorist threats, according to the Post.  

Another blow to the agency, insiders claim, came when Bush ordered the Secret Service rolled into the new Department of Homeland Security following 9/11.  

It was formerly part of the Treasury Department, which has deep pockets and treated the Secret Service like a crown jewel, the Post reports. 

In Homeland Security, former agents say, the Secret Service suddenly had to compete for money with much larger agencies 

Secret Service has about 6,200 employees. Other Homeland Security departments like the Transportation Security Administration and the US Customs and Border Protection - which each have about 50,000. 

 All this comes as the budget has mostly stayed flat - or even contracted a little. The 2013 budget was $1.5billion, down from $1.6billion the year before. The agency responded by cutting 300 jobs. 

'There was a competition for dollars in an increasingly finite budget environment,' Chris Cummiskey, a former Homeland Security official in the Obama Administration, told the Post.

On September 19, an intruder armed with a knife jumped the White House fence and made it inside the front door president's home before he was finally tackled and arrested. 

Director Julia Pierson resigned as a result of dramatic lapses from that incident - including Secret Service officers who weren't trained in how to respond to an intruder, radios that didn't work correctly and other stunning lapses in security. 

Pierson herself took over in the wake of another scandal - the prostitution debacle in Colombia 2012 that saw several agents lose their jobs after they were caught partying hard and buying hookers while on an advance trip to scout security ahead of President Obama's arrival. 

Despite pleas from current and former Secret Service agents for more money and resources, some in Washington say that the agency has never wanted for anything - and they it must learn to cut unnecessary fat. 

'I don’t think the Secret Service has been held accountable for the last 15 years,' Utah Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz told the Post.

Tom Ridge, the first Secretary of Homeland, Security said: 'The entire focus of the nation shifted after 9/11, and all federal agencies had to adjust to the new realities.

'That said, the Secret Service, because of its protective mission and direct ties to the White House, never suffered from a lack of resources to carry out their critical responsibilities during my time at DHS.'

Earlier this month, a report from Homeland Security blasted the budget management of the Secret Service because agency officials couldn't even give a figure for how much it costs to protect the White House. 

 'No one has really looked at how much the mission, done right, actually costs,' the report found.
