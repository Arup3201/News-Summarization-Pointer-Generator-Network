The popular View-Master toy, beloved of children from the 1960s onwards, has got a modern makeover.

Toy manufacturer Mattel has worked with Google on the new toy, which will rely on a smartphone to deliver its optical trickery.

The virtual reality device makes use of Google’s Cardboard to deliver immersive scenes such as Alcatraz prison in San Francisco, called ‘360 degree photospheres’.

The plastic body of the device has been given a sleek and less angular look than previous models, but still includes a slot for film reels.

To release the phone’s virtual reality features, an Android smartphone running Mattel’s app is needed.

The smartphone needs to be inserted into the device along with a reel,meaning that parents will have to surrender their handsets while children play.

The gadget uses augmented reality and animations to make the scenes feel immersive.

Mattel says that its View-Master is an affordable platform enabling children to take ‘engaging field trips’ so they can explore famous landmarks, natural scenes and planets, for example, in ‘photospheres’.

By pairing an ‘experience reel’ with a smartphone, children ‘will immediately experience an imaginative and interactive learning environment,’ according to Mattel.

According to the View-Master description of the experience on its new website, users of the device will feel like they are inside the scene.

It says: 'Move your head. Look around. Embark on immersive 360-degree journeys exploring and learning about the world through stunning visuals.

'Take a virtual field trip to Paris and sit in the shadows of the Eiffel Tower as it soars above you. Visit historic Alcatraz Island and interact with your surroundings to discover fun facts.

'Travel through time and space in ways you never thought possible. Watch as the solar system comes to life on your kitchen table or share with a friend to view the constellations overhead.'

Originally conceived in 1938, the View-Master, a handheld device showing 3D slides, was originally aimed at adults, but became a popular toy in the 1960s (an old version of the toy is shown)

Children of the 1960s and onwards have marvelled at slides showing everything from 3D scenes of the world (two examples are shown) to cartoon characters though their View-Master toy. New version of the disk to be used in the new device will cost $15 (£10) for a themed pack of four

In 1938, cameraman William Gruber produced 3-D colour slides for stereoscopes - which were popular in 19th century homes – using two cameras strapped together.

An encounter with Harold Graves, president of Sawyer's Photographic Services in the Oregon Caves National Monument led to a partnership a year later.

They came up with the View-Master – a new way of viewing tourist attractions in America – which was sold to adults in camera shops.

It was only in the 1960s that the View-Master became a toy, and afterwards, cheap reels were produced showing scenes across the world, Disneyland and cartoon characters in ‘3D’.

Today, the toy is produced by Fisher Price - part of the Mattel group.

‘The View-Master was first introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York, giving consumers access to spectacular 3D worlds by simply selecting a reel and looking through a device,’ said Doug Wadleigh, SVP and global brand general manager, Toy Box at Mattel.

‘By working with Google's Cardboard platform, we are now able to take that experience even further bringing the discovery and immersive viewing experience of the View-Master to the digital age.

‘Combining technology and innovation with this classic toy gives kids an enhanced experience allowing for play opportunities not yet imagined through new, digitally curated content.’

The device itself is set to be released in autumn for $30 (£20), with reels sold in themed packs of four for $15 (£10).

Mattel told MailOnline the toy will come to the UK early next year. 

A sample reel that will come with the toy will include a gallery of classic View-Master images, such as a journey into space with a tour inside a space shuttle.

Star Wars packs may be in the pipeline, because Mattel senior vice president Doug Wadleigh told USA Today: ‘We're creatively trying to figure out ways to use the old imagery in ways that enhance the new experience.’ 

Mattel will also work with Google Cardboard developers to create new content. 

Last week, Google and toy maker Mattel sent out a retro-themed invite that hinted the toy might be getting a hi-tech makeover. Many commentators correctly guessed that Google's Cardboard would be the basis for the new View-Master

South Korean electronics firm LG has also worked with Google to make a plastic virtual reality device based on Cardboard.

It will be given away free with the firm’s G3 smartphones from this month, enabling owners to play on VR-compatible apps and games.

The smartphone slots into the plastic gadget’s viewer, which has two holes for users to peer through to see action on the phone’s screen.

South Korean electronics firm LG has also worked with Google to make a plastic virtual reality device called VR for G£ (pictured) based on Cardboard

The design of ‘VR for G3’ deviceis based on the blueprint for Google Cardboard.

The neodymium ring magnet on the side of the VR for G3 works with the magnetic gyroscope sensor in the G3 to select applications and scroll through menus without touching the display.

‘While still in its infancy, this is just the beginning of the virtual reality movement which until recently was expensive and inaccessible to everyday consumers,” said Chris Yie, vice president and head of marketing communications at the LG Electronics Mobile Communications Company.

‘By leveraging Google Cardboard, not only are regular consumers able to participate in the VR experience, we’ll be able to introduce this technology to future developers who may one day show us how VR can be used to improve our lives.’

The toy is a tool for Google to get a younger audience into virtual reality.

Mike Jazayeri, Product Director for Google Cardboard said that the toy will ‘make immersive virtual reality experiences as accessible as possible for everyone.’

‘Many of us on the Google Cardboard team grew up playing with View-Master, so we were excited to collaborate with Mattel and to see the viewer evolve and work with Google Cardboard,’ he added.

The device was teased in an invite last week, where many commentators correctly guessed that Google would base the toy on its Cardboard project.

Last summer, the Mountain View-based tech firm revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard, which was given out to attendees of the firm's annual developer conference.

It used a mobile phones as the display, with a special app to show 3D images and video.

Google seems to be intent of winning the hearts and minds of children, having announced last week that it has acquired Launchpad Toys, which is behind the iPad app Toontastic.

Google has previously announced plans to make child-friendly versions of some of its products such as Chrome, YouTube and search, which are set to be released this year.

There was some speculation that Google may have re-focused its ‘Cardboard’ project for children. Last summer, Google revealed a virtual reality headset made of cardboard (pictured) but it wasn't commercialised
