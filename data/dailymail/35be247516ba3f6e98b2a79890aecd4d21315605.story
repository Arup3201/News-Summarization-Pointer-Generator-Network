It can be tricky to know how much money to save from one month to the next, especially when balancing budgets and having to pay out for unexpected bills.

But a new  service takes the hassle out of this by securely tracking your spending habits and automatically saving a small amount for you each week.

Named Digit, the service only transfers what it thinks you can afford and adjusts this amount accordingly to help you easily build up a nest egg.

Each time a Digit account is opened and linked to a bank account, the service automatically sets up a savings account for that user (pictured). Once or twice a week, Digit transfers money from the bank to the Digit savings account based on how much money the user has, and how much they’ve been spending recently

Digit was designed in San Francisco and connects to bank accounts to analyse income and spending.

Each time an account is opened and linked to a bank account, Digit automatically sets up a savings account for that user.

Once or twice a week, Digit transfers money from the bank to the Digit savings account based on how much money the user has, and how much they’ve been spending recently.

Digit securely and anonymously connects to bank accounts and analyses income and spending.

Each time an account is opened and linked to a bank account, Digit automatically sets up a savings account for the user. 

The website uses 256-bit bank-level security, and doesn’t store bank login details. 

A user’s information is anonymised, encrypted and securely stored and all funds held within Digit are insured up to a balance of $250,000 (£162,750). 

This is typically between $5 (£3) and $50 (£32) but is never more than the user can afford.

Over time, the service uses a built-in algorithm to learn more about the user’s spending habits and adjust payments accordingly. 

And if the user ever needs extra money, they can transfer it back at any time for free.

To transfer money, users just need to send Digit a text and they will release the funds back to the account.

‘Digit automatically figures out when and how much is safe to save based on your lifestyle,’ explained the firm.

‘Digit doesn't require you to figure out an arbitrary amount to transfer every month.

‘We believe so strongly in our math and the ability to safely identify money you don't need that if we overdraft your account we'll pay the fee.’

Accounts can be accessed and managed using the mobile site or desktop dashboard.

In terms of security, Digit uses 256-bit bank-level security, and doesn’t store bank login details.

A user’s information is anonymised, encrypted and securely stored and all funds held within Digit are insured up to a balance of $250,000 (£162,750).

Digit supports more than 2,500 banks and credit unions but is currently only available in the US. 

The firm said it is hoping to expand internationally in the future, however. 

If a user wants to close a Digit account they email the service and any remaining funds in the Digit account is automatically transferred back to the original checking account on the next business day.
