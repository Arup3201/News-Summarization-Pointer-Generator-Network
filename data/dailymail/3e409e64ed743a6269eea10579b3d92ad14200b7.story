The parents of eight-month-old conjoined twins who were successfully separated yesterday have revealed their relief as doctors said the complex operation 'went very well'.

Allison and Amelia Tucker, from Adams, New York, were born joined at the lower chest and abdomen, and on Wednesday underwent the gruelling seven-hour separation surgery.

Much to the joy of their parents, lead surgeon Holly Hedrick from the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia said the surgery 'went very well and as expected' and they will now be monitored closely.

She added that she expects the twins, who once shared a chest wall, diaphragm, pericardium and liver, to live 'full, healthy and independent lives'.

The twins’ mother, Shellie Tucker, 
has kept a blog documenting her daughters’ progress, and just hours 
after the surgery was completed, she revealed her joy at the successful 
operation.

'Today it is a 
time to celebrate, to be thankful, to appreciate, to praise, and to 
enjoy this weight lifted off our shoulders,' she wrote.

'The
surgery went better than expected. The girls did amazing. The surgeons 
were able to separate the girls and close them with the skin they grew 
over the last five months.'

She added: 'After the girls left us yesterday I had a
sense of calm and strength come over me. These girls are going to do big things in life!'

The family now hopes Allison and Amelia will be able to return home in time for their first Christmas.

Shellie had previously written of 
the family's struggles on the blog. She wrote how she married her husband, Greg Tucker, in 2009, and had issues getting pregnant.

After
having their first son, Owen, she wrote: 'Our chances of having a 
second baby was very slim. We tried month after month with no success.'

She
wrote that after fertility treatment, she and her husband were overjoyed to find out 
they were pregnant again.

Yet, showing two heads, their 20-week ultrasound have the first sign there was something wrong.

'My husband and I were in complete shock (we still are),' Shellie wrote. 'We couldn’t believe it.'

In March, she underwent an emergency C-section and gave birth to her daughters.

At work: Surgeons separate the twin girls, who shared a chest wall, diaphragm, and liver, on Wednesday

Team work: As many as 20 staff worked on the operation, the 21st of its kind at the hospital

In her last post, written on Tuesday before the surgery, she asked for prayers, and spoke of her exhaustion.

'We
have done all a parent can do,' she wrote. 'At this point, it's in the 
surgeons’ hands.We just have to hold our breath and hope and pray God 
listens to our thousands of supporters. We will be okay. We will be 
strong.'

But the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia said the girls were 'excellent candidates for separation'.

Officials said the surgery will be the 21st separation of conjoined twins performed at the hospital.

Conjoined twins occur once in every 50,000 to 60,000 births, and most are stillborn. About three-quarters of such twins are female and are joined at least partially in the chest, sharing organs.

Sibling rivalry: The girls have an older brother, Owen

Chances of successful surgery and survival are greater if the twins have separate sets of organs, the hospital said.

A year ago, conjoined 20-month-old twins from the Dominican Republic were separated at a Virginia hospital.

Maria and Teresa Tapia were attached at the lower chest, and surgical teams successfully divided their liver, pancreas and other shared organ systems and reconstructed their abdominal walls.

A few days before that, 2-year-old twin sisters Angelica and Angelina Sabuco from San Jose, California, who were joined at the chest and abdomen, were separated in procedures performed at a California hospital.
