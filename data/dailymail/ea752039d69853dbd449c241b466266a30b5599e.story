Philippe Coutinho has found himself a home away from home on Merseyside having seen his popularity soar among Liverpool fans.

The 22-year-old has been in impressive form for his club this season and also put pen to paper on a new long-term contract.

The Brazilian left his home city of Rio de Janeiro in 2010 to join Internazionale, but it is in Liverpool he has started to produce his best form since moving to Anfield in January 2013.

The 22-year-old Brazilian wants to evolve as a footballer having signed a new contract at Liverpool

Now, Liverpool TV are giving fans a glimpse of Coutinho's life on Merseyside away from football with a new documentary starting on Friday night.

The show features an in-depth interview with the Brazilian at his home, where he talks about his journey from South America to European football.

'My objective has always been to play at a big club, to grow and evolve as a footballer and have a run of game,' Coutinho said. 'I didn't have that at my previous clubs and feared it would be the same at Liverpool.

'But here it's like a family, a club where the manager likes to use young players. Our team has many young players and I've been given a run of games.

'The manager has given me opportunities and this has built my confidence. Since I arrived the manager has always trusted me and that has been very important.'

The Brazilian added: 'Football is what I like to do. It is so much more than work. I love to play football. I always loved it, when I was young it was all about football. Football is my passion.

Coutinho's wife Aine, who came from the same neighbourhood as the Liverpool star, also features in the documentary.

She describes Coutinho as 'a very affectionate and incredible person'.

'When I say I'm his fan, it's not only because of football but as a person,' she added. 'And not only because he's my husband but because he truly is an amazing person.'
