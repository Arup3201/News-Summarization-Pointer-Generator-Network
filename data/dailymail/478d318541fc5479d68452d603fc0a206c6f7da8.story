Crispin Blunt has been reselected to fight the seat of Reigate for the Conservatives

A Tory MP has survived an attempt by Conservative ‘dinosaurs’ to de-select him after he admitted he was gay.

Former Prisons Minister Crispin Blunt was reconfirmed as the candidate for Reigate and Banstead seat after allies launched ‘Operation Meteor’ - a reference to the prehistoric asteroid hit on earth that is credited with rendering the dinosaurs extinct.

Mr Blunt won a five to one victory in a ballot of every Tory member in the constituency after members of the local party board attempted to oust him.

He has held the seat since 1997 and won in 2010 with a majority of 13,500.

His win was hailed as a triumph for Tory moderates last night as Mr Blunt’s critics readily admitted that his homosexuality and support for gay marriage had turned them against him.

Mr Blunt revealed in 2010 that he had separated from his wife to ‘come to terms with his homosexuality’.

Tony Collinson, a member of the Reigate party’s executive committee, would not reveal whether he had supported Mr Blunt, but said he thought homosexuality was wrong.

‘Everyone is entitled to their own view and we had a secret ballot on it and I don’t think I should make any comment,’ he said.

‘I can tell you that the selection committee was not happy to have anyone that might have had any sort of thing in the cupboard.

Mr Blunt won public support from David Cameron and Michael Gove after he announced he was gay

‘I’m a Christian and I don’t think in fact that [homosexuality] is right. But that is entirely up to people. They must search their own consciences.’

Another executive member, Roger Newstead, told a fellow Tory in a letter: ‘There is no doubt in my mind that [Mr Blunt’s] very public and totally unnecessary announcement that he was “gay” was the final straw for some members’.

Mr Newstead said: ‘To me it was an error of judgment. You don’t have to go out and tell people you have got homosexual tendencies - that sort of thing you know. It is a private matter and it shouldn’t have been put in the public domain. He put it in the public domain.’

But Mr Blunt won public support from David Cameron, Michael Gove, Eric Pickles, Michael Howard and Boris Johnson.

The MP said last night: ‘This is a triumphant vote for tolerance which critics outside the party might not have believed possible.

'It says a great deal about Reigate, and the vote reflects very well on both the community and the local party.’

Another figure in the local association said: ‘You can’t change people who are 75, 85, 90. They’ve got their own views from years ago.’

The case was reminiscent of another constituency spat when the so-called ‘Turnip Taliban’ in South West Norfolk sought to ban candidate Liz Truss over an affair she had years before with Tory MP Mark Field.

She eventually won and is now an education minister.
