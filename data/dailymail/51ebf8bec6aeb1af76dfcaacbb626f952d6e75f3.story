His brutal death outraged Britain, but Woolwich murder victim Drummer Lee Rigby may be honoured with a funeral at Southwark Cathedral, it emerged last night.

The young soldier’s shockingly brutal death  has brought calls for the celebration of his life to be a fitting tribute, and it is expected that hundreds of his friends and comrades will want to bid him farewell.

Southwark, because of its size and proximity to 25-year-old Lee’s barracks in Woolwich, would be ‘an appropriate and fitting venue for such an occasion,’ said a church source.

Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, the victim of the Woolwich knife attack

Such a large ceremony would provide a poignant illustration of the 
nation’s support for the soldier who was knifed to death last week.

With so many of his comrades, friends and relatives wanting to attend 
Lee’s funeral, a large church will needed and 1,500 mourners could fit 
inside Southwark Cathedral, believed to be the capital’s oldest, dating 
back to 606AD.

But Lee’s family from Manchester – mother Lyn and and stepfather Ian - 
will of course have the final say along with his wife Rebecca. 

His parents live in Middleton , Manchester. But the city’s cathedral cannot be used due to restoration work taking place there.

Tribute: Southwark Cathedral, London's oldest cathedral, may host Lee Rigby's funeral

Last night, they were still coming to terms with his tragic death just yards from the barracks.
The service is likely to take place in two to three weeks, given the criminal investigation into his death.

A military funeral, with soldiers from Lee’s unit - the Royal Regiment 
of Fusiliers mounting a guard of honour, would be arranged by the Army 
Chaplaincy Service.

His colleagues from the 2nd Battalion, the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, 
are planning a poignant cermonial tribute to their fallen comrade - a 
drumhead ceremony which dates back to the Battle of Waterloo.

The ceremony, which is rarely performed, involves hundreds of personnel 
gathering on a parade square. One by one the drummers march in single 
file to the middle of the square and place their drums on the ground.

The bass drum is placed at the back with the smaller drums in front. 
Rifles are then placed against the drums and the regimental colours are 
draped over the top. Regimental pipers then play the Last Post.

A Fusiliers’ source said: ‘This is the most appropriate tribute we can 
put on for Lee, given the time he spent in the band. The drumhead 
ceremony has been performed in the same fashion for centuries and 
according to strict guidelines.

‘From a distance the drums and flags look like an altar. Hundreds of 
years ago the drumhead ceremony was performed on the battlefield as 
soldiers fallen in combat were lowered into the earth. Today it remains a
deeply moving occasion.’

A time and venue for the Fusiliers’ drumhead ceremony is yet to decided 
but The Mail on Sunday understands that Lee’s family will be invited to 
attend.

Meanwhile, calls for a minute’s silence across Britain next week at the time when he was killed were growing last night.

On social media network Twitter people from all backgrounds demanded 
that their employers allow them to pay their respects to the tragic 
soldier next Wednesday afternoon.

The deep emotions stirred by Afghan veteran Lee’s death in such 
appalling circumstances were clear to see yesterday as thousands of 
bouquets and floral tributes built up at the site where he was hacked to
death.

While a backlash of anger has been apparent in many areas of the country
following Drummer Rigby’s murder, at the spot where it happened, 
comments were mostly confined to paying tribute to a fallen son and 
offering comfort to his loved ones.

A steady stream of well-wishers added to the hundreds of flowers left at
the corner of John Wilson Street, where three days earlier the 
25-year-old father-of-one died at the hands of two suspected terrorists.

In one heartfelt message, a picture of Drummer Rigby with his 
two-year-old son Jack was pinned to the railings, with the caption 
“Daddy and his little soldier! R.I.P Lee”.

Union and St George’s flags were draped among the flowers, while a 
number of Manchester United football shirts were on display to recognise
the young man’s lifelong support for the club.
Emotions were clearly still raw when a young woman broke down in tears as she arrived to see the sea of flowers.

Wearing a green hoodie, she sobbed and wiped tears from her eyes with a 
tissue as she read messages of condolence left for Drummer Rigby.

She was surrounded by more than a dozen friends and family members, many of whom appeared visibly upset.

A peaceful march was also held in the area by members of the Nigerian 
community in an attempt to distance themselves from the two murder 
suspects whose roots lie in the West African country. 
Nigerian Kanbi Ojelade, 50, was among those paying their respects today,
along with his two sons, Umran, 10, and Feranmi, 11, who both live in 
Woolwich.

Mr Ojelade, who lives in Colchester, said: ‘I brought them here to 
realise people are responsible for their freedom, safety, their welfare 
and development.

‘The ultimate price anyone can pay is to give his life for others.’

Royal British Legion member Charles Clayton, 66, said he believed the 
Government could have done more to identify the terror suspects earlier.

‘He shouldn’t be forgotten,’ Mr Clayton said.

‘It demonstrates the society we now live in. I blame the Government for 
allowing this to go unchecked which puts us all at risk.’

Scores of motorcyclists supporting the Help For Heroes charity – whose 
teeshirt which Lee was wearing may have singled him out as a victim - 
rode past the scene yesterday in a show of support for Drummer Rigby’s 
family.
