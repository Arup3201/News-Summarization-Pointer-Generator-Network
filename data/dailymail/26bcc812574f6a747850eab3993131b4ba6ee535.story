Michelle Jannetta, 31, died at Milton Keynes Hospital after a catalogue of errors by staff. An inquest heard staff accused her of faking illness

A 31-year-old mentally ill patient died unnecessarily because of a catalogue of errors by A&E staff, an inquest has concluded.

Michelle Jannetta, from Bletchley, Milton Keynes, died at Milton Keynes Hospital on March 8, 2012, after taking an overdose of painkillers.

While at the hospital she was left in the care of unqualified healthcare assistants, was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma, and was not given the antidote which could have saved her life, the inquest heard.

Her medical notes were also written on the back of a glove which was subsequently lost, and staff mixed up her blood samples with those from another patient.

The coroner, Tom Osborne, delivered a 
narrative verdict, which stated that: 'There was a failure to undertake 
and report on her regular observations and a failure to recognise her 
deteriorating condition or the seriousness of her situation that 
resulted in a lost opportunity to render further effective treatment 
before she went into respiratory arrest caused by obstruction of her 
airway, attempts at resuscitation were unsuccessful and she died at 
11.18 on 8th March 2012.'

Ms Jannetta, who had a history of mental illness, arrived at the hospital’s A&E department at midnight on March 7, 2012.

Initially, she told staff that she had not taken any drugs. She later told staff she had in fact taken Tramadol.

She was well known to the department’s staff but they failed to administer the antidote which would have counteracted the effects of the painkiller within minutes.

Her family’s lawyer, Carolyn Lowe, a partner in the clinical negligence department of Henmans Freeth LLP, told MailOnline: ‘There is no record of anyone having considered giving her the antidote.

‘The whole attitude of the staff was clouded by the fact that she was a regular attender – she was not treated as the vulnerable patient that she was.’

Ms Jannetta was left in the care of a healthcare assistant, instead of a nurse, and only two sets of formal observations were taken during her 11 hours in the hospital.

One of these sets of results was written on a surgical glove which was then lost.

She was believed to be faking her illness despite being in a deep coma.

She was not given the antidote which could have saved her life.

Her medical notes were written on the back of a glove which was then lost.

Her blood samples were mixed up with those of another patient.

The second set of observations was taken by a healthcare assistant at 8.30am but she failed to report the seriously abnormal results to her seniors.

Ms Lowe said: ‘Either the HCA did not recognise the danger signs or she did, and she failed to pass on the information.

‘If the findings had been passed on, Michelle would have been put on half hourly observations and her rapid deterioration in the following hours would have been spotted.

‘The coroner believes that the observations should have been carried out by a fully qualified nurse because having HCA’s playing this role is a major risk to a patient’s life.’

The inquest also heard that Ms Jannetta had been placed to sleep on her back which resulted in her breathing becoming obstructed and caused her death.

While she was in the hospital staff also mixed her blood gas samples with that of another patient.

She died at 11.20am after she stopped breathing.

Nicola Rose, Ms Jannetta’s sister, said: ‘Michelle may have suffered with mental health issues but to the family she was a fun-loving and caring person who was very much adored by every one of us.

‘Michelle was a very much loved aunt, daughter and sister who we all miss desperately.

‘It has been incredibly difficult to come to terms with her untimely death. We wish she was still here bringing smiles to us all and we'll never forget her.

‘We can only hope that her tragic death 
will bring a change to attitudes towards mental health patients who are 
being treated in a general hospital and make it a safer place for the 
vulnerable and those struggling with mental illness.’

Ms
 Lowe added: ‘Michelle’s inquest has highlighted the problems that 
vulnerable patients with mental health issues can encounter in hospitals
 and I hope that the Trust will have learnt lessons from this.

‘I can only hope that the family can 
take some comfort from knowing that as a direct result of Michelle’s 
death the coroner has written to the Secretary of State for Health 
asking her to consider changing hospital policy so that observations 
taken in patients who are seriously  ill, like Michelle , are to be 
carried out by trained nurses.

‘As the coroner said, this should mean that Michelle has not died in vain.’

She told MailOnline: ‘It is clear that due to staff shortages it has become general practice in hospitals for healthcare assistants to take nursing observations.

‘Whilst this may be acceptable in patients that are not seriously ill, for patients that are very ill or have for example taken an overdose, like Michelle, observations should be taken by fully trained nurses who are able to take them and then to interpret them properly. 

The hospital has apologised that 'Michelle did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect'

‘If that had been done on the night that Michelle was admitted to hospital then she would most likely still be here today.’

Joe Harrison, Chief Executive of of Milton Keynes Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, said: 'Our thoughts are with Michelle’s family at this difficult time.

'Michelle sadly passed away in our Accident and Emergency Department in March 2012. We are sorry that Michelle did not consistently receive the high level of care that we expect.

'Since Michelle’s death, we have conducted an investigation to ensure lessons are learned. We will be continuing to improve our service in regard to emergency patients.

'The Coroner has issued a Rule 43 to the Secretary of State for Health to express his concerns about the national practice of healthcare assistants (HCAs) taking crucial observations. 

'We have already commissioned the Open University to provide training for 50 of our Healthcare Assistants (HCAs) to build on their skills.'
