A rare friendship has blossomed between a convicted murdered who is the only female on death row in Georgia and a retired theologian in Germany.

Kelly Renee Gissendaner is awaiting execution by lethal injection at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification State Prison in Jackson for the 1997 murder of her husband in suburban Atlanta.

Gissendaner masterminded a plan to stab her husband to death with her boyfriend so she could be with her lover and collect her spouse's life insurance.

The 47-year-old will be the first woman to be put to death in Georgia since Lena Baker, an African-American maid convicted by an all-white jury of shooting her employer after he threatened her in 1945.

Pen pals: Kelly Renee Gissendaner, 47, a convicted murderer sentenced to be executed by lethal injection, has been corresponding with German-based theologian Professor Jürgen Moltmann for years

However Gissendaner, who admits to her brutal crime, has reportedly turned over a new leaf in prison.

After being sentenced to death in 1998, she enrolled in a theology studies program for prisoners, The New York Times reported.

During her studies, Gissendaner became particularly enamored with Christian literary luminary Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was imprisoned and killed by the Nazis.

Gissendaner also enjoyed the work of Professor Jürgen Moltmann, a German theologian 'whose books on hope, suffering and liberation have helped define postwar Protestant thought', The Times writes.

Gissendaner was shocked to learn that her own teacher knew Professor Moltmann, and asked if she could reach out to him.

With the teacher's blessing, Gissendaner sent Professor Moltmann a paper she had written on Bonhoeffer.

Again to her shock, he replied.

The two have since become pen pals and have exchanged around 30 letters.

Moltmann spoke to The Times from his home in Germany, and said he enjoys discussing 'theological and fath' issues with Gissendaner. 

'And I have found her very sensitive, and not a monster, as the newspapers depicted her,' he told the newspaper.

'And very intelligent. She has been rehabilitated. She has changed her mind, and her life.'

In October 2011 the two were actually able to meet, after Professor Moltmann was booked to give a lecture in Atlanta and took it upon himself to visit Gissendaner.

They had a supervised visit and discussed all the things they would have normally put in their letters, mostly about faith. 

Gissendaner began her studies at Metro State Prison, near Atlanta. 

However the program closed, and she was forced to do the course in her cell. 

A teacher visited her one-on-one for two hours, every Friday, for six months.

Gissendander's requests for clemency were recently rejected - her final appeal.

A chaplain who met Gissendaner when she first arrived in prison named Susan Bishop wrote a testimony for the clemency that said: 

'Professor Moltmann, who has been vocal of his own remorse at having fought in the German Army, offered his own of what could happen to Gissendaner after this point. 

'If the State of Georgia has no mercy, she has received already the mercy of Heaven,' Moltmann told The Times.

However Gissendaner was still found guilty of a heinous crime.

At trial, the court heard details of how she spent months planning to kill her husband, Douglas Gissendaner, with whom she shared a volatile relationship.

According to CNN, the two divorced in 1993, only to remarry in 1995.

On February 7, 1997, she dropped the man she had secretly been having a relationship with, Gregory Owen at her home, giving him a baton and a hunting knife.

She then went out dancing with friends.

Douglass Gissendaner was out with friends as well, so Owen waited inside the house.

When Douglas Gissendaner came home around 11pm, Owen forced him at knifepoint into a car and drove him to a remote area of Gwinnett County.

Owen beat the man with the baton in the woods and stabbed him in the neck eight to 10 times.

He stole his watch and wallet to make it look like a robbery.

Gissendaner arrived at the scene as the murder took place but stayed in the car, the court was told.

She did get out however to make sure her husband was dead.

Gissendaner and Owen used kerosene she had brought with her to set fire to the car, and the two left together in Gissendaner's car.

Murdered: Douglas Gissendaner and stabbed and beaten to death in woods outside Atlanta. Police found his decomposed body two weeks later

Police found the victim's car the next day but failed to find the body, and Gissendaner went on television to appeal for information concerning her husband's disappearance.

Police eventually found the body, and Gissendaner and Owen were brought in for question.

Their stories soon started to fall apart and Owen eventually confessed to the crime.

He then struck a deal with police to testify against his lover and is now serving life in prison.

When Gissendaner learned of the plea deal, she started writing letters from prison to bribe someone into confessing they took her to the crime scene at gunpoint.

Gissendaner asked her cellmate, Laura McDuffie, to find someone who would make the confession for $10,000, however McDuffie subsequently turned Gissendaner in. 

The prosecution painted her as a monster who wanted to kill her husband for money. 

After 25 years in prison, Gissendaner was due to be executed this week, but it was postponed.

A decision about her new execution date will be made Monday.

Gissendaner has already chosen her last meal -  cornbread, two Burger King Whoppers with cheese, two large portions of chips, cherry vanilla ice-cream, popcorn, and lemonade.
