A double chin is the dreaded sight faced by many people looking into a mirror.

Now, a U.S. company claims to have invented an injection which can banish that chin bulge.

ATX-101, an experimental drug made by California-based Kythera Biopharmaceuticals, is injected into the skin over a series of treatments spaced no less than one month apart.

The drug is a type of deoxycholic acid - a naturally-occurring molecule that helps the body break down fat, according to Kythera's website.

It acts 'immediately on targeted fat cells' but is 'rapidly cleared' from the chin, leaving surrounded tissue largely unaffected, Kythera claims.

It says fat under the chin is influenced by ageing and genetics, and can often not be changed by diet and exercise alone.

While this area of the face is important to patients, it is undertreated, according to Kythera.

ATX-101 not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the body that regulates medicines and cosmetics in the U.S.

But in clinical trials the injections were tested on more than 1,600 people, with 90 per cent reporting it reduced the fat under their chin after two years, Kythera said.

As part of the trial, ATX-101 was injected up to four or six times, based on the amount and volume of the fat under the chin.

However, common side effects included pain in the chin, numbness, bruising, swelling, redness, firmness, itching, a burning or prickling sensation and nodules.

While Kythera said these side effects were 'temporary' and 'mild-to-moderate in severity', in previous studies 13 per cent of participants dropped out of the trial due to these  effects.

If approved by the FDA ATX-101 will be a 'first-in-class' drug to stop double chins, Kythera said.

Other treatments for fat under the skin are invasive, or lack evidence, according to a study on ATX-101 published in the British Journal of Dermatology.

ATX-101 is made from a purified synthetic version of deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring molecule in the body.

The molecule aids in the breakdown of dietary fat.

It is currently in late stage clinical trials for the reduction of fat under the chin, which commonly presents as a double chin.  

Treatment with ATX-101 contours the area under the chin by destroying fat cells, while leaving surrounding tissue largely unaffected, it's manufacturers Kythera claim.

The destruction of fat cells is followed by a natural healing response that involves clearing away dead cells. 

Common side effects included pain in the chin, numbness, bruising, swelling, redness, firmness, itching, a burning or prickling sensation and nodules.

While Kythera said these side effects were 'temporary' and mild-to-moderate in severity, in previous studies 13 per cent of participants dropped out of the trial due to these side effects.

These include a neck lift, known as a platysmaplasty, which is a procedure to lift sagging skin in the neck, or liposuction of the neck and chin.

While these procedures are effective, they are expensive and can have long recovery times of up to a year.

Liposuction is the most common treatment for fat under the chin but it can result in complications and an unfavourable result, the study said.

There is little evidence proving non-surgical treatments work to reduce double chins long term, it added.

A 2012 report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) found that chin surgery grew more than breast augmentation, Botox and liposuction combined in 2011.

The procedure skyrocketed in both women and men, as well as in all patients over the age of 20, with the largest increase seen in patients age 40 or older, it said.

There were 20,680 procedures in 2011, a 71 per cent increase compared to 2010, making it the fastest growing plastic surgery trend at this time.

Dr Malcolm Roth , who was president of the ASPS when this report came out, said: 'The chin and jawline are among the first areas to show signs of aging. People are considering chin augmentation as a way to restore their youthful look just like a facelift or eyelid surgery.'

'We also know that as more people see themselves on video chat technology, they may notice that their jawline is not as sharp as they want it to be. Chin implants can make a dramatic difference.'

A 2012 report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) found cases of chin surgery in the U.S. were rocketing. It was the fastest growing plastic surgery trend in 2011, it said
