Cornwall's tourism board is seeking to soothe holidaymakers' fears over the swarms of jellyfish being washed up on its beaches this summer.

According to the Marine Conservation Society, by mid-July there were already been 500 sightings of the floating animals across the south west seaboard.

Experts have linked the spike to low wind levels and balmy sea temperatures, which have peaked at 21 degrees.

Familiar visitor: The Barrel jellyfish is the most common jellyfish found in British waters

However, local tourism bosses have sought to reassure visitors that the jellyfish invasion is no threat to their safety.

Malcolm Bell, Head of Tourism at Visit Cornwall, told Sky News: 'It's no different really to rock pooling - you keep your eyes open for the crabs and everything else.

'It's part of the habitat, it's part of the fun thing about having a British beach holiday.'

The most common jellyfish found in British waters is the barrel jellyfish. One metre in diameter, it can also be found on the coastlines of Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.

However, while the barrel jellyfish is considered to be harmless, the smaller, translucent Moon jellyfish, which constitutes 29 per cent of the species' population, can have a very mild sting.

There have also been sightings of the fearsome Portuguese Man O'War, which carries a nasty sting, although they are far more rare.

With sightings set to increase in the coming months, conservationist Patrick Maher from Dive Newquay advised: 'The important thing to remember with jellyfish is that they can continue to sting even after they have been washed up on the beach and are dead.

'Don't poke them, don't pick them up - avoid them and allow the authorities to remove them, seek medical advice if you get stung by one, but we are very lucky in Cornwall to have these types of species in our waters.'
