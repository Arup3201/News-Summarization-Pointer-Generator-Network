Abbie Levens, a 32-year-old prison officer who sent explicit photographs of herself to armed robber Sherome Blair

A woman prison guard who sent an explicit video of herself performing a sex act to a male inmate she fell in love with, was jailed for eight months today.

Abbie Levens admitted she formed an 'inappropriate relationship' with armed robber Sherome Blair while he was serving a nine-year jail sentence on the wing where she worked.

The 32-year-old prison officer became besotted with Blair - telling him she loved him, wanted his children and calling him her husband in phone calls and text messages.

She sent him a pornographic video of herself and sexual texts to two mobile phones he had illegally smuggled into prison during an eight-month fling, a sentencing judge heard.

Their illicit relationship had continued even after the prisoner was transferred away from High Down jail in Surrey, where he was serving time for his role in a £300,000 diamond heist and was on remand as a suspect in an attempted kidnap case.

The pair met in May 2010 after Levens had been transferred to High Down from nearby women’s prison HMP Downview after she became a prosecution witness in a corruption case against a former Downview Governor.

She denied she ever had sexual contact with Blair. However, she admitted she did send him a self-filmed pornographic video of herself on June 12, 2011. The video was sent the day before he was transferred to HMP Pentonville in London.

Levens carried on communicating with Blair via texts and calls to mobile phones he had smuggled inside prison, even after he had moved from her care.

She also burned him music CDs which were posted to him in Pentonville via his mother’s address.

Following a tip-off in June 2012, police officers raided Levens’ home in Wallington, Surrey, and seized 'a large number' of love letters Blair had sent to the prison warder.

The letters, found stashed in a bedroom wardrobe, appeared to reference fleeting sexual moments the pair had stolen together while she was supposed to be on duty at High Down prison.

However, Levens successfully claimed to a judge at Guildford Crown Court that the undated letters were 'purely fantasy' and extracts from an erotic novel the pair were writing to each other while he was inside Pentonville jail in 2011.

Blair, 32, of South London, was jailed for nine years in March 2004 for his part in a violent raid on the Ace of Diamonds jewellers in Holborn, London.

He and 11 others wearing helmets pulled up outside the shop on high-powered motorbikes, threatened staff with sledgehammers and escaped with a tray of diamonds worth £263,000, which were never recovered.

Blair was released from prison early in 2008, but recalled on licence in 2009 because he had been placed on remand to face charges of kidnap and attempted robbery. That case was later dropped by prosecutors.

He was sent to High Down prison in April 2010 and started his relationship with Levens shortly before being transferred to Pentonville in June 2011.

The court heard Levens had been diagnosed with suffering from severe depression and anxiety at the time after she became a key prosecution witness in a corruption case against the former Governor of HMP Downview women’s prison, where she had worked from 2003 to 2010.

Her evidence led to Russell Thorne being jailed for five years in July 2011 for having a three-year affair with a woman inmate.

Levens claimed that she was 'in a bad place' when Blair made his advances on her, due to death threats she had allegedly received prior to the trial beginning.

She told the judge Blair first contacted her in a letter he wrote to her around June 2011. Days later, he made a surprise phone call to her home, saying he knew what she was going through and wanted to help her.

Levens admitted she was 'lonely and depressed' and sought solace in the inmate’s interest in her.

'I was obviously going through a bad time. I’m not saying it was right, but at the time I was not in the right state of mind,' she told the judge.

She claimed Blair had helped her through her tough times, adding: 'I’m honestly telling you if this had not happened I don’t know if I would even be here.'

She later admitted she became besotted with Blair, adding: 'I was in love, your Honour, I’m not going to lie.'

However, the relationship fizzled out after he was released from prison in February 2012, the court heard.

Levens admitted one count of misconduct in a public office.

Her defence barrister, Gerry Mohabir, had asked Judge Peter Moss to suspend her prison sentence for two years in an 'act of mercy' to his client.

However, the judge ordered eight months immediate imprisonment.

He said: 'You knew the rules. Despite your loneliness and depressed state, you flaunted those rules. You embarked on a relationship and permitted a man facing serious crimes and a long sentence to have access to mobile phones.

'There was a very high degree of infatuation in you sending him that explicit video; in saying you loved him; that you wanted to have his children and calling him your husband.'
