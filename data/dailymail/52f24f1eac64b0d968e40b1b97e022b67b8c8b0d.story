Three gap year students have been killed in a road crash in Thailand just days after beginning their ‘trip of a lifetime’.

School friends Conrad Quashie, 19, Max Boomgaarden-Cook, 20, and Bruno Melling-Firth, 19, had saved for months before setting off from Heathrow on Thursday last week for a tour of South-East Asia.

Their parents had warned them to stay away from drugs and motorbikes – but they died instantly early on Tuesday when the coach in which they were travelling from Bangkok to the northern town of Chiang Mai was hit from behind by a bus.

Wreckage: The three men are said to have died instantly

Conrad, who had been due to start 
university in Manchester with Max in September, had celebrated his 19th 
birthday in the Thai capital on Saturday with his two friends and 
girlfriend Elisa Smith, who then flew back to London.

The trio set off on Monday by overnight bus for the north, planning to go trekking in the hills to visit tribal villages.

Tragedy struck shortly after 
midnight. Some 40 passengers from all over the world were injured, 
including another Briton who is still in hospital.

Last night distraught relatives paid 
tribute to the adventurous boys who all had promising futures when they 
left Charter School in Dulwich, South London, last year after finishing 
their A-levels.

Conrad’s mother Amanda Bean, 48, an 
English teacher, said at her home in nearby Denmark Hill: ‘Conrad was 
due to go to Manchester Metropolitan University in September with his 
friend Max who also died in this tragic accident.

Chiang Mai: The boys had been heading to the northern Thai city, 422 miles north of Bangkok

The Charter School is Dulwich was founded in 2000 after a campaign by parents in the area that there was no state secondary school to cater for their children.

It is a mixed, non selective comprehensive with around 1,000 pupils, located on the borders of Dulwich and Camerberwell.

It was built on the site of two former schools encompassing the old buildings, with new additions, including a sports hall.

The school now has two specialisms - science and business - and is classified as a High Performing Specialist school.

Ofsted has also described the school as 'outstanding' on two occasions following inspections.

The school was given national exposure in 2004 when Tony Blair made a visit to publicise the then government's five-year plan for education.

‘They were inseparable friends and 
they had even applied to live in the same hall of residence.’ Conrad was
due to study history.

Miss Bean, who is separated from 
Conrad’s father Paul Quashie, 47, a computer financial analyst, said the
families had met   before the trip to talk about the possible dangers 
on holiday.

‘We drummed into them not to hire 
motorbikes, to stay away from drugs, and not do anything silly,’ she 
said. ‘But than they have had this terrible accident. It was not their 
fault and there was nothing they could do about it.’

She added that a friend of the boys 
who had survived the crash, a 19-year-old called Jack, had returned to 
London and told the parents the accident was over very quickly and 
‘there was nothing the boys would have known about it’.

Max’s father Gerhard Boomgaarden, 48,
who works in publishing, said at his home in Herne Hill, South London: 
‘I am absolutely devastated. I did not know human bodies could produce 
so many tears. It is such an intense pain that will never go away.

‘He was such an incredibly bright boy with a big future ahead of him.’

Max was due to study history and politics and was a regular volunteer for a leukaemia charity.

His father said he had been planning 
the nine-week tour of Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia for years. Mr 
Boomgaarden said: ‘A few years ago he said to me, “Dad, before I am 
twenty I will have travelled around South-East Asia”.

‘It was a dream of his. I never 
dreamt he would be coming back in a metal container. The one consolation
is I understand their deaths were instantaneous.

‘Just the day before the accident I 
received an email from Max and he said they were all having a wonderful 
time. The thing is, he said how much he loved me, and he signed it with 
ten kisses.’

Mr Boomgaarden said Max’s stepmother 
Madeleine was also distraught, as well as his brothers Leo, 16, and 
Ivan, six, and stepbrother Leon, 13. Max’s mother Polly Cook, who lives 
nearby, was so upset she could ‘barely talk’.

Bruno’s mother Gillian Melling, who lives in Central London, was too upset to speak.

David Sheppard, head teacher at The 
Charter School, said the teenagers were ‘delightful young people’ who 
had joined in the sixth form.

‘They settled in very quickly and 
they were really well liked amongst the community,’ he said. ‘They were 
credits to their families and they were really looking forward to making
a contribution to society.’
