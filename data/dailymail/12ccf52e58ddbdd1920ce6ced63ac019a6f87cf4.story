Jose Enrique put paid to the belief that all sportsman are coordinated when he displayed some truly remarkable baseball skills on tour.

Liverpool's left-back looked positively frightened of the ball, backing in to the corner as he tentatively swung and missed at numerous pitches. Needless to say, Babe Ruth's crown is safe.

But the 28-year-old did not let the lack of talent spoil his mood. He said: 'Having some fun after the game. I'm so bad at this hahahaha.'

Liverpool are one game in to. their US tour. They lost last night to Ashley Cole's Roma. Daniel Agger deflected in Marco Borriello's 90th-minute shot to give the Italian side a 1-0 victory at Fenway park, the home of the Boston Red Sox.

Jose Enrique will be hoping to impress Brendan Rodgers after losing his place in the side last season. The Spaniard injured his knee in November and even though he has returned to fitness Jon Flanagan has played his way in to the number one spot.

Liverpool's remaining pre-season games are against OIympiacos (July 27), Manchester City (July 30), AC Milan (August 2) and Borussia Dortmund (August 10).
