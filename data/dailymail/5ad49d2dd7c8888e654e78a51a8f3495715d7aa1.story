Picture a group of monkeys and you might imagine them swinging from trees, gathering bananas or perhaps squabbling over scraps of food.

But from toasting marshmallows on a camp fire to writing with paper and pen and flossing their teeth, these primates have found better ways to pass the time.

And here they are practising their remarkably human-like skills in a series of images that have never been seen before.

Resourceful long-tailed macaques in Thailand use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth, in a new three-part documentary on BBC1 called Monkey Planet

Kanzi the bonobo lives in America and has learnt how to build a fire, light it using matches, and toast marshmallows on it. It shows just how like us some primates really are

There’s
 Kanzi the Illinois-based bonobo, who orders picnics on a smartphone, 
using technology that would baffle even some humans.

He can also cook fry-ups on fires he has built, lighting piles of broken tree branches with a match.

And
 to satisfy a sweet tooth, the dexterous primate toasts even uses his 
homemade fire to toast marshmallows he has skewered on a twig.

Then there’s the orang-utan who has taught himself how to write, gripping a pen in the fist of his hand.

And resourceful long-tailed macaques in Thailand use human hairs plucked from tourists to floss between their teeth.

Tonight the monkeys will be seen in the first episode of a three-part documentary on BBC1 called Monkey Planet.

It will see zoologist and presenter Dr George McGavin travel the globe to seek out the most interesting primates in the wild.

Unlike
 some other species, many of them live in close knit communities, where 
they encounter situations that may be familiar to some humans.

Take
 the hierarchical system for hamadryas baboons in Ethiopia, for example,
 where the dictatorial males dictate over their packs.

And in Peru, male emperor tamarins are conned into childcare.

Much
 of their activities are governed by need – such as an elaborate alarm 
system South African vervet monkeys use to warn of predators.

While thieving rhesus macaques in India stage lookouts as their peers raid properties for food.

But
 just like us humans, there’s room for fun in their lives as well, as 
proven by the primates cannon balling into a pool of water. 

And
 enjoying what appears to be the equivalent of a spa day, their cousins 
in Japan spend their days languishing in hot springs, while delighted 
tourists take their photographs.

Dr
 McGavin, who has appeared in several other BBC documentaries including 
Ultimate Swarms and Lost Land of the Tiger, spent a year visiting 
primates to learn about how they behave. Those with the largest brains, 
such as apes and orang-utans, he said, were the most equipped to copy 
human traits, and could be taught how to do things like writing.

But smaller primates, like macaques, will adapt their behaviour because of the environment they are in.

Dr
 McGavin said: ‘You can have the same species in two different places 
and their behaviour will be different. With the macaques in Thailand for
 example, one of them will have realised they could use a strand of 
human hair to get annoying bits of food out of their teeth and the 
others will have copied. In another part of Thailand, where there are 
fewer tourists, they won’t do the same.’

What
 most of it comes down to however, Dr McGavin said, is a desire for 
food. And it is why the Indian macaques, living in rural areas, have 
evolved to scale buildings because they know it comes from inside. 

Dr
 McGavin said: ‘Animals like this adapt to their habitat very, very 
easily. So as opposed to having a jungle vine you’ve got power lines and
 it’s actually the same. You basically swing through those and instead 
of food being hidden as a prize in the trees it’s inside the buildings.

They just have to work out how to get hold of it. That’s evidence of how their brains work.’
