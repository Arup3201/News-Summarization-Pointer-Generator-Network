Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne in his Mansion House Speech to City dignitaries earlier this month said: 'I want Britain to be not just the western hub of Chinese finance - but of Islamic finance too'

The first Islamic government bonds could be issued by the Treasury as early as this week after a roadshow by Whitehall officials in the Middle East  and Asia.

The Government plans to raise £200million from the bond issue – the first carried out by a Western country – as part of an effort to make the UK a global hub for Islamic finance.

Sharia forbids Muslims earning or paying interest, but carefully designed products avoiding interest payments are widely used in the Islamic world to raise finance within religious rules.

Officials 
from the Treasury and Britain’s Debt Management Office toured Islamic 
cities last week visiting, among others, Jeddah, Dubai, Riyadh and Kuala
 Lumpur.

A
 Treasury spokesman said the meetings with Islamic financiers had been 
productive and that there was ‘quite a lot of support’. The bonds - 
properly know as Sukuk - could be sold to Islamic investors ‘as early as 
next week’. A key deadline is June 29 when the Islamic holy month of 
Ramadan begins.

The money raised will be repayable in five years. But  instead of interest, bond-buyers will earn rental income from three Government offices.

While widely used in many Islamic countries Sukuk is still controversial among some conservative Islamic scholars who regard it as a contrived way of getting round Sharia.

The Sukuk is being handled for the UK Treasury by a syndicate of banks led by HSBC.

Chancellor George Osborne has made clear his desire for London to be a centre for international finance with a particular focus on the Islamic world and China, an aspiration repeated by the chancellor during last week’s visit by Chinese premier Li Keqiang.

He first unveiled plans to issue a £200million Sukuk at the World Islamic Economic Form held in London last October.

And in his Mansion House Speech to City dignitaries earlier this month  he said: ‘I want Britain to be not just the western hub of Chinese finance – but of Islamic finance too.’
