The man who threatened to blow up the Australian embassy in Jordan after being deported from the Gold Coast in August last year may have been motivated by a family matter.

Ali al-Hasanat, 37, is on trial in Amman accused of threatening to kill Australian tourists and bomb the Australian embassy in the Jordanian capital, through messages and a 'picture of a bullet' sent via his Facebook account.

Hasanat's Facebook profile shows him making expletive-laden threats against the Australian government and posting pictures of himself showing young children how to hold machine guns and pistols.

Hasanat moved to the Gold Coast from Jordan in 2001 and became an Australian resident in 2004, the ABC reported.

While in Queensland he received more than 30 criminal convictions, for reasons including drug dealing and breaching court orders.

He was also sentenced to multiple stints in jail, including eight months in 2008 for threatening, using a carriage service to menace or harass and assault occasioning bodily harm.

Hasanat was sentenced again in 2011 to 24 months in jail after he imprisoned a woman against her will in a Gold Coast apartment and held a knife to her throat.

The 37-year-old is not believed to be part of any terrorist organisation, with a close friend telling the ABC he is a 'lone wolf' but is erratic due to his use of the drug ice.

In Jordan's state security court in Amman this month, Hasanat was accused of using the internet 'to carry out activity that could expose Jordan to acts of aggression' following his threats against the Australian embassy.

He denied any wrongdoing during the hearing, but faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.

The trial was adjourned earlier this month to give Hasanat time to find a lawyer.

His threats against the Australian government appear to have been motivated by a family matter.

'To any mother f***er from Australian government in or outside Australia this message is for you as you can tell I am not wearing a mask or hiding my identity you have been denying me my daughter for over 10 years now for no reason at all,' he posted on Facebook in April.

'Listen here you putrid son of a b****s stupid ignorant alcoholics I am no indian or aboriginal [sic] if you f*** with me I will have to f*** with you dying for my daughter will be an honour for me.

'I am not scared of dying for this cause you have 6 months from today which means you have till 26/10/2014 to fix this and give me a right to be a father.'

While living in Australia, Hasanat had a son with a Gold Coast woman, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

In court in Amman this month, Hasanat was accused of using the internet 'to carry out activity that could expose Jordan to acts of aggression'

The pair had arguments over social media in May, with Hasanat abusing the woman when she did not respond to some of his messages.

In July, she wrote to him saying she loved him and was planning to move to Jordan, adding that she was 'hurt' that he faked his own death in a car crash.

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison said Hasanat's visa had been cancelled.

'The individual was removed from Australia and has been permanently excluded from Australia,' Mr Morrison said.
