Chelsea are in talks to buy AFC Wimbledon’s humble Kingsmeadow stadium with a view to using it as a venue for their youth and women’s teams.

The 4,800-capacity stadium in Kingston-upon-Thames, which will host AFC Wimbledon’s FA Cup third round tie against Liverpool on Monday, is also home to Kingstonian, who play in the Isthmian Premier.

The land is owned by Kingston Borough Council and the lease belongs to AFC Wimbledon, who bought it from Kingstonian in 2003.

AFC Wimbledon, however, are keen to return to their spiritual home in the London borough of Merton and ideally into a new ground on the site of the former greyhound stadium on Plough Lane, close to where the club’s original Crazy Gang legend was born.

Plans for this new venture are at the public consultation stage of Merton Borough Council’s planning process but the club are optimistic of achieving the target to be back in Plough Lane for the 2017-18 campaign.

They have been in talks with various interested parties about the future of Kingsmeadow, which is officially known as the Cherry Red Records Stadium, and Chelsea have struck a deal, according to the Surrey Comet.

The Premier League club want a permanent venue for their youth and women’s teams because the U21 team is using Aldershot Town and the women Staines Town. Chelsea has a small stadium at the training ground in Cobham, but this has very limited public access.

AFC Wimbledon issued a statement which said: “The Dons Trust, owners of AFC Wimbledon, can confirm that the club has been in discussions with a number of organisations, including Chelsea Football Club, over the future of Kingsmeadow, should our club’s proposal to move to a new stadium in Wimbledon be approved by Merton Council.

'These discussions are confidential and each proposal is being thoroughly evaluated to ensure it provides the best outcome for the area and the club. Kingston Borough Council and Kingstonian FC, of course, have been briefed about the discussions.

'Any change of ownership of Kingsmeadow is a Restricted Action, which requires approval by the membership of The Dons Trust before it can be completed. In the event that The Dons Trust Board believes that acceptable terms have been negotiated, then these will be presented to the membership for their consideration. Until then we cannot not comment any further.'

Kingsmeadow will feature live on BBC TV on Monday when Liverpool visit in the FA Cup third round tie, which is a reprise of the famous 1988 final, when Wimbledon won 1-0 at Wembley.

A Chelsea spokesman said: 'I can confirm Chelsea FC is in preliminary discussions with AFC Wimbledon regarding taking control of the Kingsmeadow Stadium in order to play our academy and women's matches there, should AFC Wimbledon proceed with its intended move to Plough Lane.'
