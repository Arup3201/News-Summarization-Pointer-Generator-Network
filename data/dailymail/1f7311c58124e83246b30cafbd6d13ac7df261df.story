Twenty-one people have been killed in the east of Ukraine after a pitched battle between 500 pro-Russian separatists and troops loyal to Kiev.

Ukraine's Defence Ministry said 20 insurgents were killed when they attacked a convoy of government troops in the eastern village of Rubizhne yesterday evening.

A soldier loyal to Kiev was killed in a separate clash near the same area early this morning.

The announcement comes after eight people were killed earlier today during a fierce gunfight between pro-Russian and Ukrainian militia, in the latest indication that Ukraine is edging closer to all-out civil war.

Grief: A member of the pro-Russia Vostok Battalion folds the arms of a dead colleague after at least eight people between the two sides, including one civilian, were killed in an early morning firefight

Rest: Pro-Russia Vostok Battalion rest after the battle which erupted when the Donbass Battalion, a pro-Ukraine militia, attacked their in the nearby town of Karlivka

Ready for battle: Vostok Battalion assemble along the side of the road

Danger: While many in eastern Ukraine resent the government in Kiev, they are also growing increasingly exasperated with the insurgents, whom they blame for putting civilians in the crossfire

Today's battle broke out when the Donbass Battalion, a Ukraine-loyal militia, attacked a Vostok Battalion checkpoint in the town of Karlivka, to the east of the embattled nation.

Harrowing
 pictures showed the aftermath of the bloodshed as fighters from both 
sides collected their dead, which included one civilian.

It
 is believed the attack was in retaliation for an ambush by Russian 
separatists near Donetsk yesterday, which killed 16 Ukrainian soldiers -
 the deadliest confrontation since the conflict began.

As
 tensions between the two countries rose, Russian President Vladimir 
Putin insisted his country will respect the outcome of Ukraine's 
presidential vote this weekend but voiced hope that Ukraine would halt 
its military operation against separatists in the east.

In Kiev, Ukraine's leader urged all 
voters to take part in the crucial ballot to 'cement the foundation of 
our nation' but pro-Russia insurgents still battled government forces in
 eastern Ukraine.

Speaking
 at an investment forum in St. Petersburg, Putin said Russia will 
'respect the choice of the Ukrainian people' and will work with the new 
leadership. He said Russia wants peace and order to be restored in 
Russia's neighbor.

Earlier, Putin had blamed the West 
for encouraging a 'coup' in Ukraine when the nation's pro-Russian 
president was chased from power and for plunging the country into what 
he described as 'chaos and a full-scale civil war.' 

In
 a live televised address from Kiev, acting President Oleksandr 
Turchynov, who is not running, emphasized the importance of Sunday's 
vote to choose a new leader.

'Today, we are building a new European country the foundation of which was laid by millions of Ukrainians who proved that they are capable of defending their own choice and their country,' Turchynov said. 'We will never allow anyone to rob us of our freedom and independence, turn our Ukraine into a part of the post-Soviet empire.'

Authorities in Kiev had hoped that a 
new president would unify the divided nation, where the west looks 
toward Europe and the east has strong traditional ties to Russia.

But
 they have now acknowledged it will be impossible to hold the vote in 
some areas in the east - especially in Donetsk and Luhansk, where 
insurgents have declared independence and pledged to derail the vote.

'We will respect the election': Speaking at an investment forum in St. Petersburg, Putin said Russia will 'respect the choice of the Ukrainian people' and will work with the new leadership

Election workers and activists say gunmen there have threatened them and
 seized their voting materials.

Joao
 Soares, coordinator for an observation mission of the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe, said Friday he expects problems with
 voting in 'less than 20 percent of the polling stations.' 

Twenty-one candidates are competing Sunday to become Ukraine's next leader.

Polls show billionaire candy-maker Petro Poroshenko with a commanding lead but falling short of the absolute majority needed to win in the first round; his nearest challenger is Yulia Tymoshenko, the divisive former prime minister, who is trailing by a significant margin.

If no one wins in the first round, a runoff will be held on June 15. Most polls predict Poroshenko's victory in that contest.

Civil war: Earlier, Putin blamed the West for encouraging a 'coup' in Ukraine when the nation's pro-Russian president was chased from power and for plunging the country into what he described as 'chaos and a full-scale civil war'

Important vote: In a live televised address from Kiev, acting President Oleksandr Turchynov, who is not running, emphasized the importance of Sunday's vote to choose a new leader

At a security conference in Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged the West to reach a settlement based on mutual interests.

'If we sincerely want to help the Ukrainian people overcome this crisis, it's necessary to abandon the notorious zero-sum games, stop encouraging xenophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments and get rid of dangerous megalomania,' Lavrov said.

Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea Peninsula in March, triggering the worst crisis in relations with the West since the Cold War. Pro-Russian insurgents also have seized government buildings in eastern Ukraine and fought government troops for more than a month.

Deadly attack: In the deadliest attack yet, pro-Russia insurgents attacked a military checkpoint and killed 14 soldiers Thursday, casting a shadow over the presidential vote

Bombed: The head of the General Staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery Gerasimov, on Friday criticized Ukrainian authorities for what he said was using artillery and other heavy weapons against civilians

Meanwhile, armed
 pro-Russian separatists ambushed a convoy of Ukrainian self-defence 
fighters today, a day after pro-Russia insurgents attacked a 
military checkpoint and killed 14 soldiers yesterday, casting a shadow 
over the presidential vote.

A number of Ukrainian soldiers were wounded in the attack, which took place near the eastern city of Donetsk, military sources said.

'They
 (the separatists) are using automatic weapons, snipers and grenade 
launchers against the battalion,' Semen Semenchenko, the commander of a 
pro-Ukrainian militia group called the Donbass region battalion, said on
 his Facebook page.

Yuri
 Bereza, the commander of pro-Ukrainian self-defence forces in a nearby 
region who had headed to the scene, told Reuters by telephone: 'The 
fighting is still going on, we are evacuating the wounded.' He gave no 
figure for the wounded.

Hours later, Russia accused the
 West of triggering the Ukrainian crisis by its 'megalomania,' as 
fighting continued in Ukraine's east between pro-Russia insurgents and 
government forces two days before a presidential election.

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged the West to reach a settlement based on mutual interests.

'If
 we sincerely want to help the Ukrainian people overcome this crisis, 
it's necessary to abandon the notorious zero-sum games, stop encouraging
 xenophobic and neo-Nazi sentiments and get rid of dangerous 
megalomania,' Lavrov said in a speech at a security conference in Moscow
 organized by the Russian Defense Ministry.

Under fire: Slovyansk, a city which has been the epicenter of clashes for weeks, has seen continuous shelling by the Ukrainian government forces, who have retaliated to the rebel fire

Still burning: There were no casualties, as the family living there had left the previous day, according to local residents

Speaking at the same conference, the 
head of the General Staff of the Russian military, Gen. Valery 
Gerasimov, blamed the West for encouraging massive protests that chased 
Ukraine's pro-Russian president from power in February.

It
 comes a day after at least 14 Ukrainian servicemen were killed in a 
firefight with rebel gunmen south of Donetsk, an industrial hub where 
the separatists have proclaimed a 'people's republic' and have vowed to 
disrupt Sunday's presidential election.

In the deadliest clash yet in the conflict in Ukraine, three 
armoured vehicles were destroyed and a series of other lorries and vans 
burned out.

The destruction of armoured vehicles 
shows that the rebels have access to heavy weaponry and are not 
lightly-armed freelance operators. It is likely to raise fears that they
 have been armed by Moscow.

A group of rebels in the town of 
Horlivka claimed responsibility for the attack near the village of Blahodatne, near the town of Volnovakha, Donetsk.

While many in eastern Ukraine resent the government in Kiev, they are also growing increasingly exasperated with the insurgents, whom they blame for putting civilians in the crossfire.

The village of Semenovka on the outskirts of Slovyansk, a city that has been the epicenter of clashes for weeks, has seen continuous shelling by the Ukrainian government forces retaliating to rebel fire.

Early on Friday, a house was destroyed by mortar fire that came from Ukrainian government side, but locals reported no casualties.

Shelling continued later in the day, targeting Slovyansk, where several other buildings were also damaged. There was no word of casualties.
