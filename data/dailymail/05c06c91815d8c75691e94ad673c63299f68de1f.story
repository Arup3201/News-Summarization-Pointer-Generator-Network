Hull KR prop James Green will miss the derby with Hull FC on Thursday after being banned for a shoulder charge.

Green was charged by the Rugby Football League's match-review panel with the grade B offence on his former team-mate Travis Burns, the St Helens stand-off, during his side's 24-20 win over the champions on Friday and submitted an early-guilty plea.

Green will be available for the Robins' Easter Monday home game against Huddersfield while centre Darrell Goulding will be eligible to play in both Easter fixtures after submitting an early guilty plea to a minor grade A trip on Saints centre Jordan Turner.

Meanwhile, Catalans Dragons full-back Morgan Escare is facing a grade B charge of making dangerous contact on Leeds hooker Rob Burrow in the closing stages of his side's 38-22 home defeat on Saturday and has until 11am on Tuesday to submit an early guilty plea.

The panel also handed down a formal caution to Leeds stand-off Liam Sutcliffe for making dangerous contact on Escare in the same game.
