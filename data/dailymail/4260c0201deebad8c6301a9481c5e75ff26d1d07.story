Kidnapped: Sahil Saeed was seized by four armed men while visiting his grandmother's home in Punjab

A married couple have been convicted of kidnapping a British boy snatched by an armed gang in Pakistan.

Muhammed Zahid Saleem, 36, and his wife Monica Neruja, 26, were jailed for 10 years each by a court in Spain.

Four masked men carrying assault rifles and hand grenades seized Sahil Saeed, five, in March 2010 while he was visiting his grandmother's home in Punjab.

Saleem and Neruja, who negotiated a £100,000 ransom and travelled to Paris from their home near Barcelona to pick up the cash, were arrested along with a friend following a dramatic police operation spanning four countries.

Three judges who tried them in the city of Tarragona an hour's drive south of Barcelona acquitted them of belonging to a criminal organization.

They had been accused of masterminding the kidnap of Sahil, found wandering along in a field following a 13-day ordeal.

But the judges concluded four men who swooped on the house in Jhelum where Sahil's family were staying ahead of their return to Oldham, had planned a robbery and kidnapped the youngster as an afterthought to secure more money.

In a 78-page written sentence released today they concluded: 'The accused Muhammed Zahid Saleem and Monica Neruja assumed the role of negotiators for the ransom payment and sent at least part of the money to Pakistan after taking off commission.

'But there's not enough proof that they plotted with the armed robbers an assault on the house where Sahil Saeed was staying as well as the illegal detention of the people inside that house.'

The friend arrested with them in Spain, Muhammed Sageiz, was acquitted of kidnap.

State prosecutors had claimed all three suspects had planned, organised and carried out Sahil's kidnap with four people of Pakistani origin.

They told the court in Tarragona Saleem travelled to Pakistan at the end of 2009 and in February 2010 to plan the snatch.

Sahil was snatched on March 4 2010, 
as his family were preparing to return to their home town of Oldham 
after a holiday in Pakistan.

The
court in Tarragona heard a gang of four men beat the family, gagged 
them and tied their hands and legs, pointed a pistol at Sahil's father 
Raja Saeed, 28, and told him: 'We know you are a businessman and you and
your family have a business in the United Kingdom.

'We are taking your son. If you try to contact the police or involve them, we will kill him.'

The
gang stole 1,900 rupees, jewellery and two mobile phones belonging to 
the family, fleeing with the boy in the early hours of March 4.

A
series of ransom demands were then made from phoneboxes around north 
east Spain demanding a ransom for the Sahil's safe return.

State prosecutors in Spain told how 
Neruja called Sahil's dad on March 10 and ordered him to travel to Paris
to hand over a £100,000 ransom.

The
boy's uncle Tauseer Ahmed ended up travelling to the French capital 
where he followed instructions to leave two bags containing the ransom 
money under a tree in a park.

Prosecutor Maria Jose Osuna said 
Neruja collected the cash and met her husband before driving back to 
their home in Constanti, 60 miles south west of Barcelona.

They were followed all the way by police.

Sahil was finally released in the early hours of March 16.

When
he was found safe, armed police from Spain's elite Special Operations 
Group stormed the flat in Spain where the three suspects were holed up.
