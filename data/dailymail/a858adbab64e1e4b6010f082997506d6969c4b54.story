Explaining the appeal of holidaying on a superyacht, YPI’s Commercial and Marketing Director Mark Duncan suggest the sea is the last real place of privacy anywhere in the world.

Clients, he added, are treated to all the luxury of an exclusive hotel, but with a change in view every day and the chance to explore coastlines and islands untouched by humans.

‘For many people chartering a luxury yacht instead of a private island or boutique hotel is a journey into the unknown.

‘Many can only compare it to holidaying on a cruise ship. Well, the similarities really begin and end with the fact that both vessels float.

‘Compared to a cruise ship, chartering a luxury yacht means you have the whole yacht to yourself. You decide where you want to go and when. You decide what you want to see and do with your guests. You decide what you want to eat and drink and when.

‘The whole experience is entirely created around you and your guests whether that your family and children or your best buddies. Ultimately it’s not just a way to travel – it’s a whole bespoke, luxurious experience. And it’s one we encourage as many people as possible to experience and savour even just once in their lives.’

One former client of the company said: ‘It’s like having the most exclusive holiday resort just for yourself, with the chefs creating menus based around whatever you like, serving them at whatever time of day or night you want. And with a yacht, you get to wake up to a new view every single morning.’

YPI CEO, Philippe Hetland Brault said: ‘We started from the principle that an App has to be useful and practical but also fun.

‘It occurred to me that yacht owners and yacht charterers often like to be able to find out more about the brand, the age and sizes of those yachts that are around them when they are moored or sailing nearby.

‘We know of many yacht lovers who already use websites and Apps to identify yachts around them, however these sources tend to mix yachts with hundreds of small boats and even merchant ships. So we decided to develop an App purely for yachting with the most comprehensive data available and the very best photography.’

Luxury yachts for charter tend to range from 25 metres to over 90 metres.

Charterers tend to charter yachts in the Caribbean in the Winter and the Mediterranean in Summer, although many are now exploring newer areas like South America, Polynesia, New Zealand and Antarctica.
