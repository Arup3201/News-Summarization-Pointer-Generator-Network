A schoolboy's heartwarming solution to the gun control debate dividing America has captured the attention of the White House.

Myles Nelson, seven, wrote to Joe Biden to suggest that guns should only fire bullets made out of chocolate.

The Vice President penned a hand-written response to the little boy praising his idea, which he said would make the country happier as well as safer - because 'people love chocolate'.

Safer and happier: Vice President Joe Biden wrote this response to a seven-year-old boy who suggested that, if guns fire chocolate bullets, the country would be safer

Chocolate bullets: Myles Nelson came up with his idea in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school tragedy in Connecticut

The Vice President, who told Myles 'I really like your idea', signed off with the words: 'You are a good boy'.

Barbara Rankin, reading specialist at the Downtown Montessori Academy in Milwaukee, told Wisn.com that Myles told her about his idea in the wake of the Sandy Hook tragedy in Connecticut in December.

'He said if we have chocolate bullets, nobody would be hurt and nobody would be sad,' she said.

Moved, the teacher encouraged Myles to share his idea with 'people who could do something about the problem'.

Response: The Vice President seemed impressed with Myles' suggestion, and told the seven-year-old 'You are a good boy'

Myles' teacher Jenny Aicher said the 
hand-written note from Joe Biden had created quite a stir at the 
small Milwaukee school, and that the seven-year-old was 'ecstatic' to 
have had his idea acknowledged.

The teacher added that being called a 'good boy' by the Vice President 'meant the world' to Myles.

Gun control advocates are calling for measures to curb gun violence including universal background checks on owners and a ban on certain military-style weapons.

The gun rights lobby insists people are safer when they are allowed to own and carry guns.
