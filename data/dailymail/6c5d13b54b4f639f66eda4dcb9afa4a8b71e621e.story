A 20-year-old California man has died after suffering fatal burns in a fireworks accident that happened at a minor league baseball stadium in San Diego on Friday.

William ‘Willy’ Calabrese, of Pacific Beach, was preparing a fireworks display for the Lake Elsinore Storm baseball game, the San Diego Padres’ minor league team, when an explosion happened at the Diamond Stadium.

The University of California at Santa Barbara student sustained burns to over 90 per cent of his body and succumbed to his injuries early Sunday morning, according to the coroner's office.

Fireworks America, the Lakeside-based company that employed Calabrese, has not released a statement regarding the incident. The exact cause of the explosion remains under investigation.

The 20-year-old victim’s parents told NBC7 that they are in a state of shock.

‘A parent's worst nightmare is losing your child,’ Janice Calabrese, William’s mother, said.

‘He was in the wrong place at the wrong time,’ said William’s father, Ron.

Calabrese sustained fatal burns after a cache of fireworks exploded all at once at around 5pm on Friday, igniting a fire which involved a truck parked nearby, the North County Times reported.

A Riverside Country Fire Department 
inspector and another pyrotechnics employee were also hurt in the blast,
 suffering what were described as minor injuries. They were taken to a 
hospital for treatment, according to Southwest Riverside News Network.

In a statement, the Lake Elsinore Storm baseball said, ‘This tragic accident has left the Storm community devastated and shaken by this loss. We feel the emptiness and offer Will's family and friends our compassion and sympathy.’

Calabrese, who attended La Jolla High School, was remembered by dozens of students, staff and friends from his water polo days at a candlelight vigil Sunday night held at the garden that Calabrese 
helped build as an Eagle Scout at Pacific Beach Christian Church.

‘Will
 was just the greatest brother I could have,’ said his brother Ron Jr. 
‘He was guy that really stuck to his guns a man of principle and he did 
what he loved. He really did.’
