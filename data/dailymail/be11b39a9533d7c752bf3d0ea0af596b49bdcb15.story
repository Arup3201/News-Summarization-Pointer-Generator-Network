As Mikel Arteta puts his body through another gruelling pre-season, three of his Arsenal team-mates are still to start their summer holidays.

Mesut Ozil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski won't be able to put their feet up until Sunday night following the World Cup Final.

'I text them to congratulate them on how well they’re doing and just hope that they can go on and win it,' said Arteta.

Preparation: Mikel Arteta takes part in Arsenal's first pre-season training session of the summer

'It must be an unbelievable feeling just to have the chance to play in a World Cup final.  

'I’m sure they’re enjoying it and the way they are playing is a joy to watch. It must be really good to be a part of that.

'We’ll be very proud for them if they win it and it will be a big experience for them to win a tournament like that.  

'It gives you confidence and another dimension. Hopefully they can do it and bring that spirit back with them to Arsenal.

'That will only strengthen our team and spirit and the ability to win which is the most important thing.

'So I am supporting Germany, absolutely. I would be so happy for these three to win it.'

Indeed, having been pilloried an eight season trophy drought, winning is once again becoming a habit at the Emirates Stadium.

First there was May's dramatic FA Cup Final win over Hull City  - and now three Gunners are on the brink of winning the biggest prize of all.

'When you are under pressure and in a difficult situations and end of up winning that trophy which is something we hadn’t done for a long time, it creates a bit of momentum and belief,' explained the Gunners vice-captain.

'Hopefully this can be the platform for the future. The FA Cup is not enough. For me, I don’t accept that.  

'For this club it is not enough and we need to go to bigger challenges now.'

Despite their excellent start, there was an air of inevitability when their title challenge faded during the closing stages of last season.

Big game: Arteta revealed he has text his German team-mates to wish them good luck for the final

Those humiliating defeats to Liverpool and Chelsea merely underlined just how far the Gunners were from reclaiming their crown as England's top club.

But the imminent arrivals of Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy will go someway towards helping Arsenal build on their FA Cup success, and perhaps, finally mount a sustained title challenge.

'All the top clubs will be strengthening and it is going to get even more difficult,' said the Spaniard.  

'Only one is going to win it and then the other ones who haven’t been good enough are going to get criticised.

Staying? The former Everton man has just 12 months left on his Arsenal contract

'If we start very well again, people will say: "Arsenal will tire by February or March". I don’t think that is going to change.  

'The only thing that will change that is if we get to that stage and go through it and win it. If we add in the right areas, together with the experience we have now, I think we have a great chance.'

But whether Arteta is at the club to play a role in their resurgence remains to be seen.

The former Everton man has just 12 months left on his contract and has been offered no guarantees of an extension.

He will hold talks with manager Arsene Wenger once the Frenchman returns to the club's London Colney HQ next week.

And if the Spaniard has his way, then he'll be at the Emirates beyond his existing contract.

New boy: Alexis Sanchez has completed his £30million move from Barcelona to Arsenal

'I cannot give you an answer at the moment but yes, the manager and I will be in contact and we will decide.

'I don’t know when, sometime soon, we want what is best for everyone. I’m really happy here and I’ve always been happy and grateful to play for this club.  

'If I continue doing that I’ll be more than happy. But if I feel I am not productive then there is no point me being here.

'At this club you are always going to challenge with big players and good players, and I’ve been doing it for the last few years with players in my position and I have no problem with competing with players.  

'But if someone comes to me and says: "Mikel, you’re not going to play anymore, you’re not important", then with my personality I don’t want to be somewhere they don’t want me, there’s no point in that.  

'But this is not the case. I absolutely expect to be here next season.'
