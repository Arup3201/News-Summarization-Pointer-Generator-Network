Reality TV star and multi-millionaire Lord Sugar has laid a complaint with police after he was trolled on Twitter with anti-Semitic messages.

As he posted a series of tweets about the Tottenham Hotspur versus Crystal Palace Premier League game on Saturday, he was subjected to a barrage of abuse.

Among other insults, several of the messages referred to the outspoken television personality as an 'old Jewish c***' and a 'fat ***'.

Lord Sugar (pictured), the star of the BBC television show The Apprentice, was subjected to a barrage of 

Despite retweeting the messages and making it clear he would be reporting them to police, the barrage of abuse continued.

In one instance, after tweeting that the referee had made a bad decision to award a penalty, a Twitter user responded: 'F*** off *** c***.

He promptly retweeted the message to his 3.9million followers, as well as to the Met Police Twitter feed, saying it was 'another one to follow up on'.

Lord Sugar, 67, has now officially reported the incident to the police, who have confirmed they are investigating.

 A spokesman for Westminster police said: “Police at the palace of Westminster have today received an allegation of malicious communication, relating to offensive messages on Twitter.

'The messages are alleged to be of a racist and anti-Semitic nature and directed at a male victim. Inquiries continue.' 

The incident is not the first time Lord Sugar has become embroiled in a controversial Twitter spat.

Just over a week ago, the reality TV star and multi-million pound business tycoon became embroiled in a row on the social network after calling a plus-size model 'fatty'.

The row unfolded after she sent him a cheeky message on January 4, which said: 'Evening sugar ;-) can I call you that? Lol.'

In the first abusive message Lord Sugar retweeted, he responded by  asking the Met Police to investigate

The second message, in which he was called a 'fat jew', was treated in a similar manner

However, one person expressed their shock at seeing the messages and offered some support to the businessman. He replied to the user, confirming he would be laying a complaint with police

He replied: 'yes no problem as long as I can call you fatty,' - which sparked outrage from some her 2,800 followers who branded him 'a bully', 'arrogant' and a 'miserable old goat'.

Miss Raouna, who won Miss British Beauty Curve in 2013, was 'absolutely fuming' at his 'cruel' tweet and said she had only sent him a message to get his attention because she was a 'massive fan' of BBC's The Apprentice.

Lord Sugar - who has an estimated wealth of £900m, made his fortune in the electronics company Amstrad. He later went on to part-own and act as chairman for Tottenham Hotspur until 2001, when he sold his remaining stake.

In recent years he is best known for his role as the star of The Apprentice, a role he has remained in since 2005.
