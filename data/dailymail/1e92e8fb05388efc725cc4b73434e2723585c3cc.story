Cristiano Ronaldo may have joined Real Madrid's training late this summer, but he's already making up for lost time.

The Portuguese winger demonstrated the drive and motivation it takes to be a Ballon d'Or winner

While the rest of his team-mates laboured through their press-ups, the 29-year-old purposefully made his more difficult by clapping in between each one.

Ronaldo enjoyed considerable success with Madrid last season, winning the Champions League and FIFA's player of the year award.

Press-ups: Ronaldo and his Madrid team-mates are put through their paces during training

Motivation: But the Ballon d'Or winner made it harder for himself by clapping every time he did one

His international exertions, however, were less successful as Portugal failed to even make it out of their World Cup group.

And Real Madrid's pre-season has been far from ideal, too. Carlo Ancelotti's men took part in the International Champions Cup, but lost all three of their games.

But Los Blancos will have a chance to redeem themselves on Tuesday when they face Europa League winners Sevilla in the final of the European Super Cup.

The European Champions then have one more friendly before facing Atletico Madrid over two legs in the Supercopa de Espana. They kick-off their league campaign at home to newly-promoted Cordoba on August 25.

Training: Cristiano Ronaldo only returned to training at the end of July as he was given extra time off

Success: Ronaldo enjoyed considerable success last season, but had a disappointing World Cup with Portugal
