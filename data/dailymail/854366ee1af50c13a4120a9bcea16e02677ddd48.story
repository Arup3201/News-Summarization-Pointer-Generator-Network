New York got a taste of Olympic fever yesterday as Times Square staged a spectacular freestyle wrestling event to decide who would take the final place in the U.S. team.

With thousands of New Yorkers enjoying the action from ringside or looking down from their office buildings, competitors from across the country proved you don't need the pantomime theatrics of the WWE to put on a good show.

And it was 26-year-old Coleman Scott who took that final Olympic spot battling his way through six gruelling matches over the space of just seven hours.

Scott, who has dreamed of wrestling for the U.S team for 20 years, fought through the pain barrier after popping a rib before his first match.

He secured his spot by defeating the favourite Shawn Bunch 2-1 in a best of three challenge.

And the match went right to the wire with
Scott securing his spot on the team with a five-point throw that 
required an official review.

He told the New York Daily News:'This is the best feeling ever. What a great night.

'You couldn’t ask for a better place-the best city in the world, and I guess now it’s a little better.'

Scott brought an impressive cheering section of around 60 friends and family from his hometown of Waynesburg, Pa.

The terrific final match-up saw Bunch refusing to give up as he charged again and again forcing Scott to play a counter-attacking game.

Scott took the first match, slipping under one of Bunch’s charges and forcing him to the ground. But Bunch fought back to take the second round by blasting Scott out of the ring with another bull-like charge.

In the final round, Scott's brilliant 5-point throw earned him a seat on the flight to London.

Scott said: 'I envisioned earlier in the day about ending my deal on a five-point throw.

'I did what I could. I’ll let this thing heal up, and I’m going to go win gold in London.'

Olympic
coach Zeke Jones, who has known had known Scott since he was in the 
seventh grade, feels the tough event was the perfect warm-up for the 
London Games, which start in 48 days.

He
said: There’s nothing tougher than to win the Olympic trials, to win 
the final wrestle off,” Jones said. “He’s in a great spot. I think he 
could be our most prepared guy now.'
