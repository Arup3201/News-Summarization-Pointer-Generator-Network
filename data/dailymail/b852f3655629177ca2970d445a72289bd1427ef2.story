Harlequins believe one of the biggest signings in the club’s history is ‘as good as done’ with former Wallaby captain James Horwill on the brink of joining the London club.

A club insider told the Mail On Sunday that the deal to bring the 29-year-old lock — capped 56 times by Australia — to the Stoop after next year’s World Cup is nearly complete.

The deal, understood to be worth more than £300,000 per year, would see Horwill join Nick Evans as one of the club’s two marquee signings whose wages do not need to be declared as part of Premier Rugby’s salary cap regulations.
