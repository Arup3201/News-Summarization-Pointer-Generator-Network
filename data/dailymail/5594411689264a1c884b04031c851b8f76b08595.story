Nearly 50,000 microwaves are being recalled over fears that a faulty component could cause them to overheat and catch fire.

The affected models were sold up to eight years ago, but the potential safety hazard has only just come to light.

They were sold under the Kenwood and Russell Hobbs brand names between 2006 and 2011 through electrical retailer Currys, and are stamped on the back with model label CJ/AL28.

No other Kenwood or Russell Hobbs products are affected.

Currys urged anyone with a microwave of this type to unplug it and not switch it back on.

Those affected can get a replacement or a credit note by returning the product to any Currys store, with no receipt necessary.

White goods superstore Currys believes that while they are being very cautious with the recall, they are doing it for good reason
