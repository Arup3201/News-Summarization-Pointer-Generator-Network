This is the heartbreaking video of the survivors of the Sandy Hook shooting as they sing Over The Rainbow in  memory of the friends and teachers they lost.

The 21 elementary school children, aged between six and nine, gathered together to sing the Judy Garland classic for charity and mark the one-month anniversary on Monday.

Some of the children had been inside the school in Newtown, Connecticut when a gunman opened fire, killing 20 children and six teaching staff on December 14.Â
