We've all heard of the camera selfie, well how about the drone selfie?

This incredible video, shot in an area renowned for its natural beauty, is American Matt Benedetto's version of the now popular pose.

Atop cliffs at North Beach in Burlington, Vermont, US, the 24-year-old stands, control in hand, facing the drone cam, while stationed dangerously to the edge of the rock-face.

Then off it goes.

Soaring into the sky above, the quality and stability of the recording is incredible - colours of the forest clash perfectly against the dark blue waters of Lake Champlain.

The landscape shots once airborne are spectacular.

Speaking to MailOnline, Matt, from New York, said; 'I have had my drone for about a year now and fly it from time to time, mostly for fun with friends or around Vermont where I like.

American Matt Benedetto took a selfie - with a drone cam

'I had hiked to that location before but with you never see the view from up there unless you are coming in from an airplane. 

'I have a monitor that shows what the camera is seeing and was pretty blown away when I was filming that shot. 

'I have been filming for a few years, mainly skiing, but started aerial flying within the past year.

The area is superbly maintained by officials and volunteers

And asked about what thoughts were going through his mind when taking on the project, he added: 'My immediate thoughts were, I was probably standing way to close to the edge and I didn't know the rock had that over hang!'

Lake Champlain and North Beach are held in high regard by officials and the local community. Water samples are sent off regularly to be tested.

Amenities at North Beach include a grassy picnic area with grills and picnic tables, a full service snack bar open daily 11am-6pm, rest rooms and foot showers, as well as the new picnic shelter which accommodates groups of up to 70-80.
