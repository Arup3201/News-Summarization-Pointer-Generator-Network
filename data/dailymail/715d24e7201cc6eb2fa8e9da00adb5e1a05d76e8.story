It is as if football’s fates are conspiring to torment Steven Gerrard in his remaining years. They show him the prize, let him glimpse the glory and then snatch it away.

That title slip, a wretched World Cup as England captain, and now this, possibly his last appearance in the Champions League, able to do so much, but not enough.

No single player worked harder to drag Liverpool into the last 16 than Gerrard. It was not to be. Maybe it never will be again.

He needs greatness around him these days, certainly to thrive in the Champions League. He needs a match winner in the manner of Luis Suarez, a rock like Jamie Carragher, a coach with the cussedness of Rafael Benitez to teach ordinary players to defend for their lives.

Ratings by Joe Bernstein at Anfield 

They are gone, and so are Liverpool now. Gone from this competition and probably from next season’s too unless they can spectacularly reverse their trajectory in the Premier League.

If Gerrard stays a Liverpool player it may be the 2016-17 season before he can think of playing in the Champions League again. He cannot soldier on alone.

That this ended in a grandstand finish is to Gerrard’s immense credit. Down to 10 men and ordinary in the extreme for much of the game, Liverpool ultimately took Basle to the wire because their captain refused to surrender.

Having won a free-kick on the edge of the area with nine minutes remaining, Gerrard stood over the ball. Could he? Would he? He did. He curled it inside Basle goalkeeper Tomas Vaclik at the near post and gave his team the puncher’s chance they scarcely deserved.

And right there is Gerrard’s agony. So close.

Jordan Henderson had two chances late on – one a shot in injury time that forced a stunning full length save from Vaclik, but it was to no avail. Gerrard was spared the opprobrium from the Anfield public that greeted this exit, but that will be scant consolation either.

Time is slipping away, and he knows it. They shout for him this season, but what else is there to shout about?

There were 72 minutes gone when Gerrard had his first chance to change the game. He was through, one on one, and set to equalise. Might this be it? The night of folklore and legend that Brendan Rodgers had forecast?

Sadly, Liverpool’s story has lost that magical element this season. Out came Vaclik throwing himself at Gerrard’s feet. His outstretched hand connected with the ball first, then Gerrard’s leg. The captain appealed furiously, so did the crowd. Referee Bjorn Kuipers shook his head.

The writers of myths and epic tales had knocked off for the night. Gerrard was doing his best to imbue the occasions with glory, but it was not to be.

And the task was straightforward enough. Beat Basle, reach the last 16. Yet only in those frenzied final exchanges did Liverpool come close. A goal down after 25 minutes, they removed their main striker Rickie Lambert at half-time so ordinary was his first-half display, but fared little better for this.

Lazar Markovic came on in his place, offering a spark of life, but then calamity struck. Just 16 minutes after arriving he was dismissed, a victim of that fatal combination – his own stupidity and the spiteful cunning of an opponent.

Markovic, who had looked lively out wide with Raheem Sterling moved to Lambert’s role, was speeding away from Behrang Safari when, for reasons best known to himself, he decided to flick out an arm to keep him back.

If he touched the Basle man it was little more than a fingertip but he fell as if struck by sniper fire. Kuipers bought it, and Markovic was shown a straight red card. He had local sympathy but, let’s face it, if Mario Balotelli had done that he would have been castigated for impetuous foolishness.

From there, Liverpool’s task appeared impossible. That they ended up even within a goalmouth scramble of victory is due to Gerrard’s refusal to quit. But one day he must quit. One day he will quit. And what will they do then?

Top and bottom of it, Liverpool looked overwhelmed, almost afraid of the challenge here. The mood was set in the first minute of the match. A loose ball fell to the experienced Martin Skrtel at the heart of Liverpool’s defence, and he cleared in panic, like a novice. 

Up it went into the night air, barely an inch further forward, requiring much hurried regrouping beneath. Variations on this theme were prevalent throughout the first-half. Simple passes went astray or were miscontrolled, touches were poor and good positions were wasted.

Anfield, so often Liverpool’s greatest friend on nights like this, sensed the desperation. The noise was often muted, a worried murmur or frustrated howl as counterpoint to the buoyant visitors from Switzerland.

Rodgers had spoken of his team becoming part of Liverpool lore, but the history of this club is great and proud and this group seemed intimidated by the challenge of maintaining that standard. Players that had looked like world beaters last season shied away from the responsibility.

Sterling’s shots had no potency and when Gerrard played a good ball to Glen Johnson for a counter-attack on the right, he sloppily let it run out of play, provoking a furious reaction from the former England captain. Lambert did not get a sniff.

It was a sobering evening, not only for the player but also for the committee that guides Rodgers’ hand in the transfer market. Liverpool could have bought close to 20 Lamberts for what they got for Suarez, but it is class that is required to win occasions like this; not numbers.

Basle are not a great side, but they are competent and technically tight and their goal after 25 minutes was all of that.

Fabian Frei played the ball into tormentor in chief Luca Zuffi, who held it up, returned it, and Frei’s shot did the rest. It was in the net without so much as a dive from Simon Mignolet. The defending was slack but why so startled?

Basle could have gone further ahead after 33 minutes when poor marking left striker Marco Streller alone to receive a cross from Taulant Xhaka. He tried to take it on the volley, but missed. Had that gone in, it would have surely been game over – so too, the chance that fell to Fabian Schar six minutes later, blocked on its way to goal.

Instead, Gerrard was allowed one more swing at playing the hero. It is an act that never outstays its welcome but, in this competition at least, it may have outlived its effectiveness.
