David Cameron has been accused of breaking the Armed Forces Covenant, under which veterans must receive priority NHS treatment

Ministers are failing to honour a pledge to Britain’s wounded war heroes who face a healthcare ‘postcode lottery’, it has been claimed.

In a devastating assessment, medical experts, MPs, soldiers and military charities have revealed that troops who suffered on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan are being badly let down.

In the past five years, around 51,300 service personnel – some still in their teens – have been categorised as injured, wounded or sick. Some will require constant care their whole lives.

Under the Armed Forces Covenant, enshrined in law by David Cameron three years ago, veterans must receive priority NHS treatment for injuries suffered in the line of duty.

But experts have come forward to point out that many are not being placed at the front of waiting lists – meaning the Government is failing to fulfil its pledge.

Professor Neil Greenberg, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: ‘The Government needs to be a bit more honest about what it is delivering and what it says it’s delivering, because the two are definitely not the same.’

Orthopaedic surgeon Professor Tim Briggs said: ‘We can do better and we should do better. Veterans weren’t aware of the Covenant. Finding access to specialist care was proving difficult, some were falling through the net.’

And Royal British Legion director-general Chris Simpkins said the £150,000 spent annually by each of ten specialist NHS mental health centres for ex-soldiers in England was ‘not enough to shield veterans from the extreme postcode lottery of variable waiting times for treatment’.

Corporal Simon Brown, who served in the Army for more than ten years, was medically discharged after being shot in the face by a sniper in Iraq in 2006. He still has not had the surgery and treatment he requires.

Condemning the ‘flawed’ system, he said: ’It has been long processes – there’s been a lot of jumping through hoops. I actually had to see a committee to see whether or not I was entitled to free plastic surgery.’

A separate report written by the Commons Defence Select Committee and published yesterday said that ‘more resources’ would need to be injected into supporting the physically and psychologically wounded.

The cross-party panel of MPs found soldiers deployed in combat roles suffered twice the usual rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and one in five of all troops experience some kind of mental disorder.

Committee chairman Rory Stewart, a Conservative MP, said: ‘British society has a unique debt of gratitude and an obligation to look after the citizens who have risked their lives for their country.’

An MoD spokesman insisted that the Government has ‘worked hard to ensure that our serving personnel, veterans and families have the support they need and are treated with the dignity they deserve’.
