The problems that have blighted the search for flight MH370 continued today when the only ship left searching the Indian Ocean was forced to return to port because of a technical problem.

After authorities agreed that searchers had been looking in the wrong part of the ocean off the west coast of Australia, only the Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen was left to continue the mission to find the jet.

But today the vessel was heading for port in Australia after it suffered a defect to its multibeam echosounder, Australia's Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre said in a statement. 

The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 is expected to continue for at least the next 12 months, with Deputy prime minister Warren Truss declaring Australia is 'committed to the search'

'The journey is expected to take a 
couple of days,' it said, an announcement that added to weeks of 
frustration in the search for the plane, which vanished on March 8 with 
239 passengers and crew.

The
 Chinese vessel was conducting a bathymetric survey - or mapping of the 
ocean floor - to help experts determine how to carry out the next stage 
of the search on the previously unmapped ocean seabed.

As well as this task, the crew were also looking for any signs of the aircraft such as debris or an oil slick.

The
 search for the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in the southern 
Indian Ocean will continue for up to another year despite recent 
setbacks.

A new  area of up 
to 800 kilometres long and 70 kilometres wide is expected to be selected
 for the new search zone. The Chinese survey ship Zhu Kezhen, has 
already begun mapping the new ocean floor and is expected to continue 
for the next three months.

The
 data collected by the ship, which is conducting a bathymetric survey, 
will determine if new search equipment can be safely towed to the area's
 sea floor to search for the airline which went missing on March 8 
carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew.

It
 will also help determine water depths, enabling selection of scanning 
technology that will be needed for a fresh underwater search.

The
 previous two-month-long search for the airline drew doubts from US Navy
 sources earlier this week when the acoustic 'pings', which were at the 
centre of the search, were no longer believed to be coming from the 
aircraft's black box.

The
 Joint Agency Co-ordination Centre confirmed that the previous search 
area was being abandoned on Thursday, and discounted as the resting 
place of the missing airline.

'The Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) has advised that the 
search in the vicinity of the acoustic detections can now be considered 
complete and in its professional judgment, the area can now be 
discounted as the final resting place of MH370,' the Joint Agency 
Co-ordination Centre said.

In an interview with the ABC on Friday however, Deputy prime minister, Warren Truss, confirmed that the search would continue despite the revelations.

'We remain as a nation committed to the search, we remain determined to do everything we possibly can to find this aircraft,' he said.

'It's our responsibility to the families of those who are involved, but also to assure the safety of the flying public into the future.'

With the departure of Ocean Shield on Friday, the new search for the aircraft or any debris is anticipated to begin in August and take up to 12 months.

The Ocean Shield departed the previous search area on Friday after it was revealed that the acoustic 'pings' whose data the search was based off, were unlikely to have been coming from the plane's black-box

A contracted survey vessel is set to join the Chinese ship which is currently surveying the area alongside another Chinese ship Haixun 01 and a Malaysian vessel Bunga Mas 6 which are assisting with transporting the survey data for further processing.

Satellite, radar and and aircraft performance data also continue to be reviewed separately to determine where the plane was most likely to have hit the water.

Seven of the so called 'handshake' signals sent by the plane to an Inmarsat satellite will be reanalyzed, as they are now determined to be the best indication of the planes final location points.

Australian search authorities narrowed the search for the jet after picking up a series of pings near where analysis of satellite data put the last location of the Boeing 777, some 1,600km off Australia's northwest coast

The discovery of the pings on April 5 and 8 was hailed as a significant breakthrough, leading  Australian search authorities to narrow the search for the jet to some 1,600 km off Australia's northwest coast.

But according to Michael Dean, the US Navy's deputy director of ocean engineering, authorities now almost universally believe the pings did not come from the onboard data or cockpit voice recorders.

He believes the pings instead came from some other man-made source unrelated to the jetliner which disappeared on March 8 carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew.

Speaking to CNN, Mr Dean said: ‘Our best theory at this point is that (the pings were) likely some sound produced by the ship ... or within the electronics of the Towed Pinger Locator.’

850 square kilometres of the ocean floor were scoured in search of the airline, but no sign of wreckage and no debris linked to the plane has ever been picked up despite the most extensive and expensive search effort in aviation history.

Authorities have not ruled out mechanical problems as a cause but say the evidence, including the loss of communications, suggests it was deliberately diverted thousands of kilometres from its scheduled route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
