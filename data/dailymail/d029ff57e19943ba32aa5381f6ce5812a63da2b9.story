Infecting: David R. Wilson, 33, is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and a two-year-old girl and infecting them with various sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, herpes, and chlamydia

A registered sex offender is charged with sexual assault and super-aggravated sexual assault of a child after raping a teen and a toddler, infecting them both with HIV, police say.

David R. Wilson, 33, is accused of raping a 14-year-old girl and a two-year-old girl and infecting them with various sexually transmitted diseases including HIV, herpes, and chlamydia. 

The enhanced charge of super-aggravated sexual assault of a child is due to the age of the younger victim, who was just 23 months old at the time of the alleged abuse.  

Police began investigating Wilson in November 2013 after the toddler was taken to the hospital with STDs.

Doctors had to perform reconstructive surgery on the toddler's genitals and hospital officials told police that it was clear that the toddler had to have been sexually abused, as evidenced by the presence of the STDs, according to the Chronicle. 

Authorities say that the toddler was sent to live with relatives as her parents live out of state and are said to have drug problems.

Click2Houston reports that investigators tested four people who lived with the baby, including Wilson, and he was the only one to test positive for HIV. He also reportedly told investigators that he had been treated in the past for chlamydia, the Chronicle reports.

ABC 6 reports that the 14-year-old told investigators that she and Wilson had sex one morning in his truck. She also said that the intercourse was her first time having sex and that she was pregnant with Wilson's child. 

Court: A charge of super-aggravated sexual assault could land Wilson with a life sentence for the rape of a two-year-old girl

It was in a cul-de-sac in north west Houston that the alleged intercourse between Wilson and the teen took place. ABC 6 reports that neighbors say the cul-de-sac is notorious for being a place where kids sneak to have sex, some even refer to it as a 'lover's lane.'

The 14-year-old also tested positive for HIV, herpes and chlamydia. 

Additional charge?: Joel Androphy, ABC 13 legal analyst, reports that knowingly exposing someone to HIV could present a charge of its own: assault with a deadly weapon

Joel Androphy, ABC 13 legal analyst, reports that knowingly exposing someone to HIV could present a charge of its own: assault with a deadly weapon. 

'It's a monster that does this kind of crime, Androphy told ABC 13. 'This guy doesn't deserve one minute less than the maximum punishment.'  

This isn't the first time Wilson has faced these kind of accusations. In 2004, Wilson was sentenced to four years in prison for raping someone else. 

Wilson was arrested Wednesday and is being held without bond at Harris County Jail, the Chronicle reports. 

ABC 13 reports that the enhanced charge could land Wilson with a life sentence.
