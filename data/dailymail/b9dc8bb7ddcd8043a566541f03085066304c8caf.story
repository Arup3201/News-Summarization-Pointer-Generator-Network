Chelsea have agreed to cash in on Andre Schurrle to free up the funds to sign Juan Cuadrado.

The move for Colombian Cuadrado, 26, could even be completed in time for him to to play in Saturday’s top-of-the-table game against Manchester City, with Chelsea eager to register him.

MailOnline Sport has learned that the deal – with almost £60million exchanging hands - moved closer in the last 24 hours.

Germany international, Schurrle in training with Chelsea last week, is keen to return back home 

Chelsea have asked for more than £30m for Schurrle, 24, and Wolfsburg have been leading the way, with Borussia Dortmund also keen.

Jose Mourinho is not a fan of the Germany international, but recognises his value in the transfer market. The World Cup-winning attacker is also keen to return home. 

Cuadrado could be registered in time to face Manchester City at Stamford Bridge on Saturday evening

Chelsea have not been in a rush to sell, although they have been actively looking for a replacement. 

Both Cuadrado and Douglas Costa have been at the top of their scouting list, but Costa is cup tied for the Champions League and was always a second choice; not least because dealing with his club, Shakhtar Donetsk, is always complicated and the transfer window closes on Monday night.

Once the Schurrle deal is completed, Chelsea will use the money to sign Cuadrado, who has a £26.8m buy-out clause.
