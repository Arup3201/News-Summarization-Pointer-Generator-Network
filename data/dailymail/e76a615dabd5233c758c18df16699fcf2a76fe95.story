Michelle Obama today shared a snap of Christmas past as she wished the nation a happy holiday.

The first lady tweeted a photograph on Thursday afternoon showing her with President Obama in their younger years, with the message: 'Merry Christmas!'

In the image, which is not dated, the young couple are standing beside a Christmas tree that is a slightly less impressive than the one at their home today.

She shared her message online as she celebrated Christmas day by singing carols and opening gifts with her husband and their daughters at their vacation home in Hawaii.

The White House said Obama started the holiday on Christmas Eve by having dinner with friends, his wife and daughters before telephoning troops who are stationed overseas for the holidays.

In the calls, he thanked the troops for their service and the sacrifice they and their families make.

Later on Thursday, as is their tradition, Obama and his wife were planning to visit with troops and their families at a Marine Corps base in Hawaii.  

On Christmas Eve, White House photographer, Pete Souza, shared another rather festive snap of the commander-in-chief - showing him wearing a jewel-encrusted tiara with a Girl Scouts troop. 

The image, which was actually taken with the troop from Tulsa, Oklahoma at the annual White House Science Fair in May, was shared by Souza on his Instagram page on Christmas Eve. He explained that he came across the image while editing his images from 2014.

ABC News noted that the smiling youngsters managed to get Obama to do something the Navy football team had been unable to do in April - wear a headdress. 

The Navy had presented Obama with a custom-fit helmet but he refused to try it on. 

'Here's the general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're president,' Obama said at the time. 'That's politics 101. You never look good wearing something on your head.' 

Also on Christmas Eve, the White House shared a photograph of Michelle Obama speaking to children on the phone for the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) and its super-popular Santa tracking program.

The first couple passed on their good wishes to the country in Obama's weekly address, and called upon the nation to give thought to the troops and their families.

The president added that the celebration of the birth of Jesus was a reminder of a message 'that has changed the world: to reach out to the sick; the hungry; the troubled; and above all else, to love one another as we would be loved ourselves.' 

On Christmas Eve, Mrs Obama had spent the day away from her husband on the fifth day of their traditional Hawaiian getaway so that they could both complete diplomatic duties and be with their daughters on Christmas Day.

While his wife was volunteering, the President enjoyed a game of golf with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak.

Obama and Najib teed off Wednesday on a cloudy but balmy afternoon at a Marine Corps base on Oahu, not far from where Obama is renting a home for his two-week stay. 

The two leaders seemed at ease together, smiling and laughing in casual clothes as they sized up their shots.

Although Obama plays golf nearly every day while on vacation, he typically restricts his foursome to a small circle of longtime friends and advisers.

'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement

But in recent years, his annual trip to Hawaii has allowed Obama to mix in a little diplomacy. 

Last year, he hit the links with New Zealand Prime Minister John Key, who owns a home in Hawaii.

Media access to Obama's golf games is typically restricted, but reporters and photographers were permitted to briefly watch the two leaders Wednesday about halfway through their game. 

Neither leader was having particularly good luck with their short game.

Up first to finish the hole, Najib came up short with his putt. 

Obama crouched low to line up his shot, but the ball tilted left and evaded the hole. 

After another failed attempt, he picked up the ball and called it quits. Najib, too, missed his next shot, but a gracious Obama gave him a pat on the shoulder and praised his golf game just the same.

'Merry Christmas,' Obama said as he waved to the media. 

In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation

Then he added a note of caution for reporters covering his Hawaiian getaway.

'Be careful about those fruity drinks,' he said. 'You never know - they might have a little kick to them.' 

Ever the statesmen, Obama and Najib also used their time on the course to discuss world affairs, including Malaysia's rotating leadership next year of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. 

'The two leaders took the opportunity to discuss the growing and warming relationship between the United States and Malaysia,' the White House said in a statement.

Najib has served as Malaysia's prime minister since 2009. 

In April, Obama paid the first presidential visit to Malaysia in nearly half a century, when Lyndon B. Johnson visited the Southeast Asian nation. 

During that visit, Obama met with Najib and pressed his government to improve its human rights and political freedoms.

Obama is no stranger to Hawaii's picturesque golf courses, and this year's vacation has been par for the course. 

The president has played a round four out of the five days he's been on the island so far.

Michelle, meanwhile, was busy helping NORAD, which uses the heat signature from Rudolph's nose to 'track' St. Nick over spots ranging from Australia to South America and on to the United States.

She volunteers each year.

While other volunteers work from an operations center in Colorado, Michelle works remotely from Hawaii each year.

She spent 30 minutes answering calls from children.

This year, Obama fielded a half-dozen calls while Santa was swooping down in Italy, Kosovo and the Czech Republic.

'Do you believe in Santa?' asked Sara, an 8-year-old from Ontario, Canada.

Mrs. Obama replied that she did ? and the president does, too.

'That's why I try to be good all year. I try to help other people and eat my vegetables, and be kind to all the kids that I know because I believe that Santa is watching,' the first lady said.

Kids can call 877-HI-NORAD or email noradtrackssanta@outlook.com on Christmas Eve and an operator will tell them exactly where Santa is based on their tracking system.

The program is based at a control center at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs.

Last year the website received 19.5 million hits, while volunteers fielded 117,000 phone calls and answered 9,600 emails. The website was launched in 1997.

Typically, NORAD defends the skies and monitors the sea approaches for the US and Canada.
