Police forces across the USA are considering changing to new hi-tech firearms - specially designed not to kill suspects.

Departments are under severe pressure to find effective non-lethal weapons following the spate of high-profile fatal shootings by the police last year.

Two models currently being considered for use are the Triple Defender and the Alternative.

New technology: The Triple Defender: The state-of-the-art Triple Defender can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas, zapping them with a stun gun and disorientate them with a strobe light

The state-of-the-art Triple Defender can incapacitate a suspect by blinding them with pepper gas, zapping them with a stun gun and disorientating them with a strobe light, CNN reports.

The Alternative consists of a small metal ball that is clipped to the end of a normal gun. 

When the firearm is discharged, the bullet embeds itself into the orange ball as it speeds towards the target and the force of the impact is significantly lessened.

A direct hit would be extremely painful but would be very unlikely to kill you.

Another non-lethal weapon: The Alternative consists of a a small metal ball that is clipped on the end of a gun. When the gun is discharged, the bullet embeds itself into the ball as it hurtles towards the target and helps lessen the bullet's impact

The efforts to develop better non-lethal weapons come after concerns over police practices following a number of lethal shootings last year.

In August 2014, unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown was fatally shot by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri - causing months of civil unrest and protests.

And in November, a police officer in Cleveland shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice dead after the young boys was reported for waving a weapon around in a park - which turned out to be a replica firearm. 

Ferguson Police Department are believed to be considering the use of the Alternative gun setting - to diminish the force of bullets fired.

Christian Ellis, founder and CEO of Alternative Ballistics, the company that makes the device, said: 'It's going to feel like you're getting punched in the chest by Barry Bonds. It's going to break some ribs.'

Another company, called Security Devices International, offers a variety of less-lethal ammunition than can be fired from 40mm grenade launchers. 

This includes projectiles containing pepper gas, or colored liquid to identify suspects. 

There's also a 'malodorant round' which contains 'a highly noxious payload that delivers an appalling odor' - designed to disperse crowds.

Historically, Tasers have been favored as the most effective non-lethal tool in a police force's arsenal. 

But questions have been raised over the device's safety with Amnesty International claiming more than 500 people have died in the US 'after being shocked with a Taser either during their arrest or while in jail'.

A Taser fires electricity into people and shocks them. On its website, Taser says its electric pulses 'affect the sensory and motor functions of the peripheral nervous system and cause incapacitation.' 

The company, Taser International claims that the weapons do not damage vital organs, have 'been safely deployed more than 3.5 million times' and saved 125,000 people from death or injury. 

The firm also disputes the Amnesty figure, claiming the tally of deaths directly linked to being stunned is closer to 60.

Killed by police: Michael Brown, 18, (L) was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a police officer in Missouri while 12-year-old Tamir Rice (R) was shot dead in Cleveland by an officer while carrying a replica gun

Taser has now provided Ferguson's police officers with body cameras.

The US military has also been researching new non-lethal weapons - specifically a futuristic device to disperse crowds.

Developed by Raytheon, the new weapon is said to work like a giant microwave, repelling crowds by blasting them with invisible heat rays.  

Raytheon describes the device - the Active Denial System - as a weapon that 'emits a focused beam of millimeter wave energy that penetrates the skin to 1/64th of an inch, producing an intolerable heating sensation that causes targeted individuals to flee'.

Kelley Hughes, an employee working in the development of the device, volunteered to get zapped by it on five occasions. 

She compared it to the sudden heat  you would feel from opening an oven door - even though she was 3,000ft from the source of the beam.

She told CNN: 'I felt an intolerable heating sensation. I felt its heat ramping up quickly and lasting a few brief seconds on my entire body. My immediate reflex was to move quickly away from the beam.'

The Air Force says the Active Denial System insists the device is not radioactive, does not cause cancer or infertility, and can only be lethal if the beam is 'sustained and prolonged many times'.

The weapon was deployed to Afghanistan in 2010 but, aside from testing, has never been used on people.
