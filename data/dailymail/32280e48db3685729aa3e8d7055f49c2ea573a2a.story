She may only be 21 years old, but Cara Delevingne has well and truly conquered the world of modelling.

With numerous lucrative and high-profile contracts to her name, she is seldom out of the spotlight - but it seems the model is not as confident as she might appear.

Speaking to the Metro, Cara admitted that she hates looking at pictures of herself, and that her foray into acting - with an upcoming role in the new Sky TV drama Timeless - has been difficult.

Cara Delevingne is making the move from catwalk queen to actress and will appear in a short film, Timeless, (pictured here with co-star Sylvia Syms), part of the Playhouse Presents season on Sky Arts

The 21-year-old supermodel looks as if she is giving it her all in this scene from Timeless, where she appears opposite veteran actress Sylvia Syms

‘I couldn’t hear it, see it [Timeless], it was horrible. It’s the same with my modelling photos as well. I’m very critical of myself but then you’ve always got to improve so I think it’s a good thing.’

Despite this self-doubt, Cara is determined to pursue her acting career, confessing that it was actually where her career began.

The Briton, who is currently dating American actress Michelle Rodriguez, says she fell into her phenomenal catwalk career as a backup when she suffered rejection in the acting world.

‘I started auditioning for movies before I started modelling but I couldn’t deal with the rejection. When I got turned down for something it would take me weeks to get over it,’ she says.

However it seems that taking a less-than-linear path into her acting career has served her well.

In Timeless, Cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in Afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great-grandmother, played by Syms

Cara certainly seemed to ooze confidence as she was seen out for the evening with Suki Waterhouse  on Wednesday in London

The model has previously only given fans a tiny snapshot of her thespian skills - appearing in a short film for Karl Largerfeld.

All reports suggest Cara has successfully made the leap from catwalk to small screen in her television debut, Timeless, a short film which will be shown on the Sky Arts channel.

Stills from the show, which is to be 
screened later this year as part of the Playhouse Presents season, suggest that far from a token cameo role, Cara has taken on a 
meaty, highly emotional part.

The blonde seemed to be in high spirits and showing no sign of self-doubt, as she enjoyed a catch-up with talented co-star Sylvia Syms

In Timeless, Cara plays a young woman whose fiance is a soldier serving in Afghanistan and the experience brings her closer to her great-grandmother, played by Syms, who was also separated from her partner due to the pressures of war.

Timeless is due to be screened on Sky Arts on June 19.
