A violent criminal who broke into a woman's home while high on cocaine and raped her in front of her young son has been jailed for 11 years.

Dwaine Bryer, 26, was on bail for other crimes when he climbed through the flat's kitchen window and attacked his victim in the boy's bedroom.

The woman only managed to get away afterwards by jumping 20 feet from the Bristol flat's balcony, injuring her back.

Justice: Dwaine Bryer was found guilty of rape by a jury at Bristol Crown Court

Bristol Crown Court heard that the boy, now aged seven, had pleaded with Bryer to stop attacking his mother and even blamed himself for what happened.

The woman was left so traumatised by the rape that she has been prescribed medication by her GP.

Prosecutor Martin Lanchester told the court: 'It has left the victim feeling like she is constantly under threat and feels she is very worried about her future.

'Her son's education has been very seriously affected and he blames himself for what happened.'

The court heard that Bryer, of Bury Hill View, Downend, Bristol, had eight previous convictions for 12 offences stretching back to when he was a juvenile.

His record included convictions for GBH, assaulting a police officer and attempted burglary, as well as a caution for sexual assault.

When he raped the woman on July 11 last year, he was on bail and subject to a curfew.

A jury found him guilty of rape but cleared him of committing grievous bodily harm against the same woman.

Rupert Lowe, defending, said that since his conviction, Bryer had come clean to probation officers and admitted the rape.

'His admission shows some courage,' Mr Lowe said. 'In his words, he was very sorry and very ashamed about what he had done.

Sentence: Judge Susan Evans QC, who jailed Bryer for 11 years, told him he had 'terrified' his victim and caused 'incalculable' damage to her son

'Mr Bryer has been in prison for almost a year and that is in itself salutary in that he really hates being where he is but he understands why he is there.

'He is truly sorry and when he is released he will not trouble the courts again.

'In his words "I will not so much as steal from a shop, which would put me in any risk of returning to where I am".'

Judge Susan Evans QC, sentencing, told Bryer he had 'terrified' the victim and caused 'incalculable' damage to her son.

'It is clear on July 11 you were a violent, selfish bully," the judge told the defendant.

'She didn't want you there. She and her son tried stopping you getting in but you forced your way in.

'You became violent to her. You took her into her son's bedroom and you raped her.

'It is in my view a sustained attack.'

The judge also ordered Bryer to remain on the sex offenders' register for life.

She told him: 'The fact you placed her in such extreme terror is also an aggravating feature.

'That young child witnessed you raping his mother. The damage you have done to that child is incalculable - no child should have to witness that.'

Emotions ran so high in court that seven police officers sat next to Bryer's friends in the public gallery.
