 A championship surfing contest in Hawaii became a battle of nerves on Saturday thanks to unusual winds and erratic waves that nearly swallowed one pro along with the men who came to his rescue.

It was Spain's Aritz Aranburu turn to try and get the best of Oahu, Hawaii's infamous Banzai Pipeline in round two of the Billabong Pipeline Masters when his board snapped in two.

That left the pro in a tight spot and nail-biting footage from the competition shows just how close he and the brave men who pulled him out came to disaster.

Nasty day to surf: A championship surfing contest in Hawaii became a battle of nerves on Saturday thanks to unusual winds and erratic waves that nearly swallowed one pro along with the men who came to his rescue

Snapped: Rescues launched a daring rescue of pro surfer Aritz Aranburu in Saturday's nasty surf at Oahu, Hawaii's infamous Banzai Pipeline in round two of the Billabong Pipeline Masters when his board snapped in two

Aranburu was especially at risk. His broken board was still attached to his ankle as a violent wave threatened to yank him back into the sea.

Life guards pulled him aboard a rescue sled, reports GrindTV, and head to shore. 

Just then, a massive wave all but engulfs them all just before the jet ski bursts out of a wall of foam and takes everyone safely to shore.

'I didn't want to surf this morning': It was a brutal  round two of the Billabong Pipeline Masters in Oahu, even for world famous pro Kelly Slater

Even renowned world champion surfer Kelly Slater said it was a terrible day to be in the water.

'I didn't want to surf this morning,' Kelly told Surfline. 'I was very, very clear I didn't want to surf...It’s dangerous as s*** out there.'

After 'a series of harrowing wipeouts,' GrindTV reports that Slater wound up dominating, nonetheless.

Half of the jet ski was engulfed as the rescuers raced to pull the surf pro--and themselves--out of the foaming maw

Success: Before the jet ski was fully engulfed, it managed to race ahead of the waves and take Aranburu to shore
