A protester leaps from a wheelchair and runs onto the pitch during the USA’s World Cup clash with Belgium.

The man, an Italian named Mario Ferri with a history of such stunts, stopped the game in the 16th minute when he ran around on the grass wearing a blue Superman t-shirt with ‘#SAVE FAVELAS CHILDREN’ and ‘#CIRO VIVE' printed on it.  

Ferri had managed to secure a ticket for the match in the disabled section which gave him a front row seat.

Sending a message: Mario Ferri stuns players by running around before being escorted off by security

He slipped through the barrier unnoticed before running unimpeded for several seconds, pulling down on his t-shirt to better reveal his message. He was eventually escorted off the field by security. 

#CiroVive was a reference to Ciro Esposito a Napoli fan who was shot in May during fan violence before the Italian Cup final.. He died last week, 50 days after the shooting, at the age of 29.

Ferri is a repeat offender from Italy, famous invading Serie A and Italy matches wearing a Superman shirt.

Ferri also ran onto the field during a match at the World Cup 2010 with a a vuvuzela, interrupting the semi-final match between Germany and Spain. 

Ferri’s antics will prompt new fears over security and also concern that concession seats are being sold on the black market.

Footage taken at the Maracana during match between France and Ecuador last week shows what appears to be a wheel-chair bound man walking to his chair.

Dozens of supposedly disabled fans have also been seen standing up in other games.
