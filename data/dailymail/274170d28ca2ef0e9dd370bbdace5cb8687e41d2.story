Colombian midfielder James Rodriguez fulfilled one of his dreams this summer when he left Monaco to join Real Madrid, joining the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo.

And the World Cup star has now also joined the Portuguese World Player of the Year in the world of fashion, after launching his own range of underwear.

The Real playmaker, who scored his seventh goal for the European champions this weekend, modelled the J10 branded underwear after teaming up with Colombian brand Bronzini.

The Colombian star rose to prominence with a succession of excellent displays at the World Cup

He follows the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldo as galacticos who have moved into the world of fashion.

Ronaldo has produced two selections of underwear, and followed it up with a range of men's shirts earlier this month.

Rodriguez, who moved to Real in a deal worth £63million following a superb tournament in Brazil over the summer, has become one of the world's most marketable players.

He was also rewarded for his excellent international displays with a place on the Ballon d'Or shortlist, although he is not expected to seriously challenge club-mate Ronaldo or Lionel Messi for the top award.  

Cristiano Ronaldo has also released his own branded range of underwear called CR7

Rodriguez and Ronaldo celebrate together on the pitch, and appear to have similar interests off it as well
