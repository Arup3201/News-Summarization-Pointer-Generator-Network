Nick Hancock almost sold Sir Stanley Matthews’ 1953 FA Cup winner’s medal for £50,000 three months ago. Instead, he put it up for auction on Tuesday and it went for £220,000.

The TV presenter, who bought the medal in 2001 for £20,000, received a staggering profit at Sotheby’s in London. The sale price made it the most expensive sports medal in British history.

‘I felt it might be my lucky day,’ said Hancock, who went straight out to buy 10 lines on the Euro-Millions afterwards. ‘It really is one of those moments, I had no right to expect it.’

Matthews' family have expressed their delight at the sale.

His daughter Jean Matthews Gough said in a statement: 'It's wonderful news, and shows the passion and remembrance the public still have for Pop.

'It would have made Pop so happy; when you consider he thought the medal was originally lost, only to discover it had been found in the attic of a house he had lived in 40 years previously.'

Next year is the centenary of Matthews' birth and his foundation, run by volunteers, has pledged to help more than 10,000 youngsters gain access to a high-class sporting experience in their local schools and sports clubs by raising £100,000. 

On a day when Ray Wilson and Jimmy Greaves’ 1966 World Cup medals sold for £136,000 and £44,000 respectively, Matthews’ gong from the Blackpool-Bolton final stole the show.

It prompted a frantic bidding war, which started at £50,000 and ended three minutes later, going for almost a quarter of a million pounds to a private buyer.

May 2: The nation was desperate for Stanley Matthews to win the 1953 FA Cup final. Twice he had been a runner-up and his third attempt was following a similar path, with Blackpool 3-1 down against Bolton with 53 minutes played. 

But the Wizard of the Dribble conjured up one of the performances of his career on the right wing to set up three goals and turn the tie for victory.

June 2: The Queen’s coronation took place at Westminster Abbey.

June 6: Sir Gordon Richards was the star jockey of his generation and finally won the Derby, at the 28th attempt, on Pinza. He was congratulated by the Queen, whose horse Aureole came second.

August 19: England’s cricketers won the Ashes for the first time in 19 years, beating Australia 1-0 on home soil.

November 25: England suffered their first defeat at Wembley against a non-British side, losing 6-3 to Hungary.

Five telephone bidders and the packed Book Room at Sotheby’s contested the much sought-after item. But the frenzy to purchase it shocked everyone after the guide price of £30,000-£50,000 was eclipsed. One Blackpool businessman was prepared to spend £100,000 and was left stunned when it went for double that sum. 

Graham Budd, whose company was in charge of the auction process, put the figure into context, saying: ‘The most expensive piece of memorabilia we’ve sold was a set of Victorian gates from Ascot Racecourse, which went for £280,000.’ 

Matthews’ medal — lot 742 — was due up at 11am and the room quickly filled five minutes before. It was standing room only as the medal was shown to the audience. There was a moment of hush before Budd kicked off the show and the bidding exploded.

The first person to call Hancock, who watched the auction at home via the internet, when the medal sold was Matthews’ grandson Matt Gough. That was quickly followed by a call from the England legend’s daughter Jean.

‘It was lovely,’ added Hancock, who used to host BBC show They Think It’s All Over. ‘They rang to say how happy they are. I’m really glad. For them it’s a real endorsement of who their grandfather was that it would sell for so much.’ 

Perhaps it was the story behind the medal which prompted such interest. Matthews won the FA Cup with Blackpool in 1953 after twice finishing runner-up between 1948 and 1951.

In front of a 100,000 crowd at Wembley — in the first FA Cup final shown live on the BBC — he starred as Blackpool came back from 3-1 down against Bolton to win 4-3 in injury-time.

Although Stan Mortensen netted a hat-trick, the game became known as the ‘Matthews final’ following a magical display on the right wing, from where the Wizard of the Dribble set up three goals.

Auction houses add a buyer’s premium to the hammer price when calculating sales figures, so Matthews’ medal comes in even higher than the £220,000 received by Nick Hancock…

Stanley Matthews: 1953 FA Cup (Blackpool) — £258,000

Nobby Stiles: 1966 World Cup (England) — £188,200

Alan Ball: 1966 World Cup (England) — £164,800

Ray Wilson: 1966 World Cup (England) — £159,800

George Best: 1968 European Cup (Man Utd) — £156,000

Gordon Banks: 1966 World Cup (England) — £124,750

Hancock will give some of his earnings to The Sir Stanley Matthews Foundation, which gives financial assistance for young people to play sport.

 ‘The original money I paid for the medal was a springboard for the charity to start,’ Hancock explained.

The bidding frenzy did not last, with Wilson’s 1966 medal, handed to the England left back after the 4-2 World Cup final win against West Germany, going to collector Nigel Wray for £136,000. 

Its guide price of £120,000 had far exceeded that of the Matthews medal.

Greaves’s medal, up next, was less prized because it was only handed to him in 2009. Up until 1974, only players who featured in the final received a medal. 

Greaves was left out by Alf Ramsey in favour of Geoff Hurst.
