They have both been high-ranking Victoria's Secret Angels who have graced the covers of Vogue over 40 times collectively.

But 31-year-old Miranda Kerr and 21-year-old Karlie Kloss have both recently claimed they don't identify themselves as models.

'I never saw myself as a model,' Ms Kerr, who has an estimated net worth of $20million, said recently to Net-a-porter's Edit magazine, while Miss Kloss, worth a more modest $4million, told Into the Gloss: 'I have never considered modelling an actual job title.'

Not models? Miranda Kerr (left) may be worth an estimated $40million, and Karlie Kloss (right) around $4million, but both successful supermodels are reluctant to identify themselves as such

And while most people would define their jobs as the thing they get paid to do - extremely lucratively in the case of these two professional beautiful people - it is true that these days, both can count themselves as established entrepreneurs too.

'If someone asks me what I do, I say, "I have my own skincare line." I don’t define myself as a model,' Ms Kerr says, in reference to her highly successful skincare care, Kora Organics, which she launched in 2009.

'I like being able to find different aspects of myself ... It's fun. I might as well do it while I can. It's not going to last forever.'

And Kora Organics is far from the only pie she has her perfectly manicured finger in. Last year, the newly single mother-of-one hung up her Angel wings to pursue a wide range of different business ventures, and to focus more on being a mother.

'The thing is, I've been modeling since I was 13. I'm now entering a new phase in my life. I have felt this coming since my son was born and, after I became a mother, I realized I needed to prioritize my time,' the Australian-born supermodel told the Sydney Morning Herald.

As well as being ranked second in Forbes' 2013 list of the world's highest-paid models - Gisele taking the top spot - Ms Kerr recently released her second second-help book aimed at young women, entitled Empower Yourself, last month launched her first music single; a cover of Elvis Presley's You're The Boss, and has graced the covers of Edit, Vogue Australia, and Lucky magazine all in the last few weeks.

Not just a pretty face: Miss Kloss recently took part in a week-long program at the Harvard Business School (pictured), with the aim of getting more involved in the successful running of a company

As for Miss Kloss, a Chicagoan-born former trained ballet dancer, she has this definition on how she earns her bread: 'I treat myself more as an athlete than just a model. I love to challenge myself physically and mentally.

'But I'm not a professional athlete, I'm not a professional dancer, I'm not a professional anything; I have never considered modelling an actual job title. I have yet to determine what my job actually is but, yeah, modelling is a fun and funny gig.'

Miss Kloss, who, much like Ms Kerr, kicked off her modeling career when she was only 13, seems to have set her eyes on a different prize of late.

Dedicated: Ms Kerr is a long-time yoga fan, and regularly loops her practice into her affiliations with brands, including Reebok (pictured), Kora Organics, and Net-a-porter, to name a few

Last month, Miss Kloss attended the Harvard School of Business for a short course in The Business of Entertainment, Media and Sports.

Speaking to The Daily, she said: 'I feel fortunate to have an incredible career but there is so much more that I want to do with my life.

'Now that I am getting more and more involved in these entrepreneurial projects I think business is something that would also be fascinating.

'I have never considered modelling an 
actual job title. I have yet to determine what my job actually is but, 
yeah, modelling is a fun and funny gig'

'To have a better understanding of economics and business, and the way to run a successful company.'

Proving her business acumen, she launched a gluten-free cookie product called Karlie's Kookies at New York Fashion Week two years ago, in collaboration with popular Manhattan bakery Momofuku Milk Bar.

Miss Kloss, who is a relationship with investment mogul Joshua Kushner, has recently teamed up with Warby Parker to collaborate on a collection of sunglasses.

And the energetic model recently showed up at the Global Accelerator program run by the UN Foundation, where she attended a panel on the topic of formulating social solutions to global issues.

Still, while both Miss Kloss and Ms Kerr may be stretching their wings way past the realms of catwalk, it seems unlikely that either will be permanently leaving their undeniable posts as 'models' any time soon.
