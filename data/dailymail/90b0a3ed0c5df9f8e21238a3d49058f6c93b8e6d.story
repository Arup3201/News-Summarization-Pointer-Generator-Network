Abuse: Lisa Brown received an offensive letter from Comcast when her bill was sent

Dummy, whore Julia and b**** dog.

These are just some of the offensive names Comcast customer services have put on top of letters and bills addressed to consumers.

They have been revealed just days after Comcast were forced to apologize for calling a patron who phoned up to complain A**hole Brown. 

Lisa and Ricardo Brown said they wanted to cancel the cable on their Comcast account - which cost them $60 - after suffering financial difficulties. 

When the couple, from Spokane, Washington, received their next bill, Mr Brown's name had been changed from Ricardo Brown to 'A**hole Brown.'

And shockingly, when Mrs Brown tried to get the profanity removed and name corrected, she faced difficulties. 

In 2005, one woman had a similar experience when a Comcast invoice addressed her as a 'b**** dog'.

Other customers, who sent their relabeled bills to customer advocacy writer Christopher Elliot, said their names had been changed to 'dummy' and another to 'whore'.

Julie Swano says her December Comcast bill was addressed to 'Whore' Julia Swano. She was surprised as she had not contacted the company for weeks. 

Carolina Heredia also got in touch with the blogger after Comcast changed the label on her online account so it read: 'Hello, dummy.'

Sako Bezdjian said the name on his parent's bill had been myseriously changed to 'Fakoe Bez' after they downgraded their service,

He believes it is meant to be an insult that sounds like 'the f-word' as it had no resemblance to their actual monikers

Mrs Brown, who has been a Comcast customer for two years, told him: 'I was never rude. It could have been that person was upset because I didn't take the offer.'

On his blog, Mr Elliot wrote: 'It's no secret that employees sometimes feel their customers are jerks. 

'But I've never seen one put it in writing — until now.' 

Steve Kipp, Comcast's vice president of communications for the Washington region, apologized for the 'completely unacceptable' incident after being contacted by Mr Elliot.

In a statement, he said: 'We have spoken with our customer and apologized for this completely unacceptable and inappropriate name change.

'We have zero tolerance for this type of disrespectful behavior and are conducting a thorough investigation to determine what happened. 

'We are working with our customer to make this right and will take appropriate steps to prevent this from happening again.'

Mrs Brown was contacted by Rhonda Weaver, a Comcast senior director of government affairs, who promised to waive the $60 cancellation fee. 

Ms Weaver also said Comcast was investigating the name change and would terminate the employee who was responsible. 

But Mrs Brown felt this was insufficient, adding: 'This is unacceptable. I am requesting everything back I paid Comcast for doing this to me.'

Sako Bezdjian said the name on his parent's bill had been changed to be closer to 'the f-word' as it had no resemblance to their actual monikers 

Mr Elliot reported that Comcast has offered the Browns a full refund of the two years' worth of bills they have paid.

Comcast says it's investigating these incidents. In a blog post, it also promised it would be investing in technology to prevent future name-changing incidents. It has already terminated the entire subcontracting company responsible for the 'a**hole' incident.

Comcast's senior vice president of customer service, Tom Karinshak, told Mr Elliot the company is taking steps to prevent unauthorized name changes from taking place in the future.

He said: 'We're retraining our teams on the importance of making name changes properly. 'We're looking for automated solutions to prevent this from happening in the future.'

Comcast says it will follow up with each customer, offer an apology and 'do whatever it takes to make things right,' says Karinshak.
