Hundreds of fake Frozen toys have been seized by trading standards officers as the must-have Elsa doll sells out across the UK.

A haul of 1,960 knock off toys were seized at the Port of Dover in Kent - including 426 Frozen character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film, intended for the Christmas toy market.

The fake toys - confirmed by Disney as counterfeit - included copies of Queen Elsa and Princess Anna dolls as people try to cash in on the demand for this Christmas' most popular toys.

Also captured were 3,000 sets of Christmas lights which were not properly insulated and could have caused electric shocks.

Many stores, such as Tesco, Toys r Us and Argos, are struggling to keep up with demand for Frozen toys including the interactive Frozen Snow Glow Elsa who sings, speaks and lights up, with an official price of £34.99.

Many list the item, tipped to be the most in demand toy this Christmas, as unavailable while any new stock is being snapped up as soon as it arrives on shelves.

Among the thousands of seized items were 1,960 toys, including 426 character dolls from the blockbuster Disney film intended for the Christmas toy market

Demand is so high that eBay entrepreneurs are cashing in by charging as much as £149.99- a mark-up of almost 160 per cent. 

The rest of the lorry load made up nearly 170,000 items and they are believed to have originated in China. It had been stopped by Border Force officers after containers were spotted and Trading Standards was alerted.

Kent County Council trading standards manager Mark Rolfe said this week’s seizure was one of the biggest hauls ever confiscated.

He said: “Not surprisingly, it was a very time-consuming task for our officers to go through the consignments and examine samples of every product.

“Some of the items we seized were clearly potentially dangerous and likely to be aimed at the Christmas retail market.

“We are pleased that we were able to protect the public from these shoddy goods and prevent any injuries they might have caused.

The lorry's dangerous load, which also included 3,000 sets of Christmas lights which were not properly insulated and could have caused electric shocks, has been permanently seized by KCC Trading Standards

“Others were counterfeit, so purchasers would have been buying an inferior product to what they expected.”

Sales of official dolls and merchandise linked to the Disney film are on course to hit all-time high for any movie franchise - overtaking the phenomenally successful Toy Story.

With one raise of Elsa’s arm you can watch her snowflake necklace light up while it plays the hit song ‘Let it Go’ and her dress magically shines.

And with a touch of her magical snowflake necklace, Elsa talks to her Frozen friends with 15 sounds and phrases.

While Toy Story sales were driven by versions of Buzz Lightyear and Woody, it is the Frozen Snow Glow Elsa which is number one on wish lists this year.

The current top five toy best-selling toys also includes a Frozen Ice Skating Elsa Doll, which is £29.99, and an interactive Frozen Toddler Doll for younger children at £39.99.

The real deal: The authentic Frozen Snow Glow Elsa, retailing at £34.99, is tipped to be the most popular toy this Christmas

UK sales of all Frozen merchandise, from dressing up outfits to dolls and jigsaws, are put at £31million up until the week ending November 8, according to retail experts at The NPD Group.

Global toys industry analyst for NPD, Frederique Tutt, said: “New items have been launched, production has been increased to meet demand, and sales are getting stronger.

“We counted three Frozen dolls in the five best-selling toys last week alone.

“If Frozen continues at this level until Christmas, not only will the license keep top spot and get the license of the year accolade but it will also beat the all-time record of Toy Story 3 - in 2010 - in terms of toy sales.”

Sales of Frozen toys are set to hit an all-time high, outstripping the Buzz Lightyear dolls that set a record after Toy Story was released.

While Toy Story merchandise was most popular with boys, Frozen is clearly a favourite for girls.

The storyline is inspired by Hans Christian Andersen’s fairy tale The Snow Queen and tells how a fearless princess sets off on an epic journey alongside a rugged iceman, his loyal pet reindeer and a snowman to find her sister, Anna, who has become trapped in a land of eternal winter.

The film overtook Toy Story 3 to become the biggest grossing animated film of all time earlier this year with ticket sales of more than £1billion, while the song ‘Let it Go’ won an Oscar and became a social media phenomenon.

Such is the demand for themed merchandise that there were reports of fights among women shoppers at the opening of a new Poundworld in Merthyr Tydfil, in Wales.

And last week, police were called to a toy store in Dublin to calm shoppers who were battling to get hold of the sought-after Elsa doll.
