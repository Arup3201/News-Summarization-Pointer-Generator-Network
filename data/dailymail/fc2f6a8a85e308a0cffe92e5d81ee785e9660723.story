A school inspector accused of ‘inappropriate copying and pasting’ in his reports has been dropped by Ofsted.

David Marshall produced identical or near-identical sections in his assessments of schools over three years while working as a lead inspector for Tribal, a private contractor used by the education watchdog.

But Ofsted said it would no longer work with Mr Marshall – who has also been suspended by Tribal – in response to a damning report about his inspections.

Concerns were raised with Tribal over similarities in Mr Marshall's reports in 2012, but Tribal insisted they were accurate. Ofsted has now said it will not work with Mr Marshall 'as a result of new evidence'

In one example, he used identical wording to describe the maths teaching at three schools he inspected in 2012. Another three schools inspected between 2012 and 2014 had almost identical wording about the support given to new pupils, the investigation by education newspaper Academies Week found.

Ofsted’s chief operating officer Matthew Coffey said concerns were raised with Tribal over the similarities in some of Mr Marshall’s reports in 2012. Tribal reviewed his work and insisted it was accurate – but Ofsted has now said it will not work with Mr Marshall ‘as a result of the new evidence brought to our attention’.

Mr Coffey added: ‘The professionalism of our workforce and accuracy and quality of all Ofsted inspection reports is our highest priority. Ofsted takes very seriously any allegations of plagiarism or inappropriate copying and pasting in reports.’

As a senior inspector, Mr Marshall conducted around 60 school assessments over the past three years in the South-East and South-West.

He has also been the headmaster of two primary schools and has 13 years of ‘extensive experience of inspection’, according to a biography that appeared on Tribal’s website but has now been removed.

His dismissal comes just a month after two Ofsted inspectors were suspended for the same offence. At the time, Ofsted’s director of schools Mike Cladingbowl said: ‘Cutting and pasting has happened in the past and we’ve taken action. But I’m pretty confident it’s not routine.’

Some examples of the identical parts in David Marshall's reports that were given to various schools

Robert Peal, an honorary research fellow at the think-tank Civitas and author of a recent report into Ofsted, said: ‘The most basic of computer programmes could be set up to scan new reports, and ensure that this lazy, cynical behaviour by lead inspectors is caught out. The fact that this doesn’t happen just goes to show how contracting out inspections to public-service providers has led to a reduction in quality.’

Ofsted announced this year that it would stop using outside contractors, with all inspectors managed in-house from next year to ensure better quality control.

Mr Peal praised the decision, adding: ‘One can only hope that when this does happen, such instances of “cut-and-paste” reporting will become a thing of the past.’
