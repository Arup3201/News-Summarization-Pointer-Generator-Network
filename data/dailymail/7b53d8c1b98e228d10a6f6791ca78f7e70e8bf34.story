Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard has been named as an ambassador for the National Literacy Trust to help motivate disadvantaged children to read.

The 36-year-old is the author of Frankie's Magic Football series of children's books and has always been a keen supporter of the National Literacy Trust - while also being Chelsea's 'Reading Star' in the charity's programme last year.

Lampard will reprise his role as Reading Star at the Etihad Stadium where he will talk about his favourite books and set reading challenges via an online video.

The former England international said: 'I am delighted to take up the role as an ambassador for the National Literacy Trust and help to further their work in supporting disadvantaged children across the UK to discover the joy of reading and develop their literacy skills.

'Reading should be a pleasure no matter what age you are, and Premier League Reading Stars is a proven way of getting children to enjoy books.

Lampard was Chelsea's Reading Star last term and is the author of a series of children's books

'It's very easy for young people to get distracted by computer games and television but the importance of getting children to enjoy reading was the inspiration behind my own books. 

'Whether you're reading with your kids or just enjoying a good book on your own it's a wonderful experience and one of life's great pleasures.'
