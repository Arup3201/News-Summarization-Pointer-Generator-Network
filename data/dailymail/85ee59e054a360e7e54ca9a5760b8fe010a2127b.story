Adam Lyth improved his chances of becoming Alastair Cook’s new opening partner by hitting 113 for Yorkshire against MCC.

The left-hander earned a first call-up to England’s Test squad for next month’s series with West Indies and was in fine form for the county champions in this season’s curtain-raiser in Abu Dhabi.

Lyth, 27, is one of two contenders, along with Jonathan Trott, to open alongside captain Cook in the Caribbean. His chances may be helped by the fact that Cook was in the MCC side to witness his 190-ball century, which included 12 fours.

Cook scored just three in the MCC’s first-innings 221 before Lyth inspired Yorkshire to 372 in reply. At close of play MCC were 13 without loss.

‘To get a hundred in the first first-class game of the season and in front of the England captain is really pleasing,’ Lyth said.

‘Alastair just said, “Well played”, and there were a few shakes of the hand... hopefully I’ve impressed him and you never know what might happen over the next few weeks.’

West Indies batsman Chris Gayle will play for Somerset in this summer’s NatWest T20 Blast. Gayle, who will miss the series against England, said: ‘I’m looking forward to coming to Taunton and scoring some runs.’
