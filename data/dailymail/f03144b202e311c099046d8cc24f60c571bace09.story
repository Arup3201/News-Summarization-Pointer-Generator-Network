Stoke City forward Bojan Krkic faces up to six months on the sidelines after suffering a cruciate knee ligament injury. 

Bojan scored a firecracker of a volley on Monday evening against Rochdale but then pulled up unchallenged while chasing the ball in the penalty area. 

The 24-year-old exited on crutches and has spent the past 24 hours in hospital. He was informed of the news on Tuesday afternoon.

As revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday afternoon, it is understood  it is an anterior cruciate ligament injury to the left knee and Bojan has been ruled out for the rest of the season.

He will undergo surgery, either in Staffordshire or in his native Catalonia.

The time-span of his absence is estimated to be between five and six months. 

Sources close to his family told Sportsmail that Bojan was devastated and taken aback by the news on Tuesday afternoon after he had revitalised his career this season under Mark Hughes.

The player believes that he has been in the best form of the career and it feels a particularly wicked twist of fate after Bojan had finally discovered consistency in his performances and opportunities at a club.

He had scored five goals in his last 10 games and has widely praised as one of the signings of the season.

Stoke confirmed that Bojan will miss the remainder of the season on Tuesday evening.

Manager Hughes said: 'It's bitterly disappointing for the club but even more so for Bojan himself as he was making such a big impact in the Premier League and clearly enjoying his football. We wish him a speedy recovery.'
