A quick-thinking, video vigilante in Oklahoma may have helped police catch a thief who brazenly walked out of a WalMart with a shopping cart full of goods he didn't pay for.

The video, recorded by a man named Anthony Smith, shows as the unidentified crook unloads the cart full of stolen items into the back of an SUV before he jumps in and the driver high-tails it out of the parking lot.

During the entire video, Smith can be heard yelling that the man was stealing from the store and all of the items he had were not paid for.
