The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge joined British veterans for a tea party in Arromanches as they joined the Queen in paying tribute to the fallen at D-Day.

Resplendent in a chic cornflower blue Alexander McQueen coat and a black dress, hat and shoes, the Duchess was all smiles as she chatted to some of the clearly delighted former soldiers.

Meanwhile, the Duke, neat in a navy blue suit, listened intently as the veterans regaled him with tales of the their experiences on D-Day and their heroics as they fought to take the beaches.

All smiles: During their visit, the royal couple enjoyed a cup of tea with some of the brave men who fought

Glamorous: The Duchess arrived with Prince William clutching a bouquet of white and pale pink flowers

One of the beaches that many of the men speaking to the royal couple fought their way along was Gold Beach, which on the 6th June 1944 was the scene of more than 400 British deaths.

These brave men will be remembered at a ceremony on the beach later today, which the Duke and Duchess also attended.

Gold Beach is one of two subjected to an assault by British troops and was the scene of a charge by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division commanded by Major General Douglas Alexander Graham.

Joining them in the bloodbath on the

 in Arromanches for the celebrations.

Other
 remembrance ceremonies which took place today included one on Juno Beach in 
Courseulles-sur-Mer, where the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of 
Cornwall joined veterans on the sands.

359 Canadians were killed
 fighting the Nazis at the location.

Hymn: The royal couple sang a collection of songs during a ceremony on Gold Beach

Chic: Kate looked both stylish and respectful as she sat on the front row for the memorial event

The
 main ceremony, however, was at Sword Beach, which saw the Queen join 
Presidents Hollande and Obama, as well as Denmark's Queen Margrethe and 
the Netherland's King Willem-Alexander, to pay tribute to the men who 
died fighting the Nazis.

Sword, 
which stretches from Ouistreham to Saint-Aubin-sur-Mer, is the most 
easterly of the D-Day landing sites, and was attacked on the day by the 
British 3rd Infantry Division, led by John Crocker and Thomas Rennie.

The
 ceremony, which included a series of performances from young dancers, 
concluded with a set of specular fireworks and a fly-past by the French 
Acrobatic Patrol Alpha Jets.
