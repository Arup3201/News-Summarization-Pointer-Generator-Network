Pokemon toy mogul Alfred Kahn and his 
wife Patsy have succeeded in a business venture where most average people lose their shirts - turning a profit with anything connected to Bernie Madoff. 

The couple, who purchased the disgraced financier's lavish Manhattan home for just $8 million in 2010 when it was sold off to compensate victims of his massive fraud, have sold it for a reported $14.5 million.

The new owner is Lawrence Benenson, the scion of yet another prominent New York family and the owners of Benenson Capital.

Pokemon mogul Alfred Kahn and wife Patsy have sold disgraced financier Bernie Madoff's lavish Manhattan home for a reported $14.5 million

Neither Benenson or his real estate agent, Dolly Lenz, returned calls for comment, The New York Post reports.

The Kahns first listed the East 64th Street property for $17.25 million last august. 

The Kahns had a rocky residency in the 4,000 sq foot living space, having reduced the price multiple times after its initial listing as well as divorcing.

There was even an unexplained fire just before they moved in.

Their experience does nothing to lessen rumors the place something of a haunted house for the one per cent, cursed by Madoff's financial sins.

Patsy laughed at the superstition to the Post shortly before purchasing penthouse duplex.

'[Alfred] was worried about the karma, but I just loved the terrace,' she said.

Beside whatever spooks may linger, Benenson now has three-bedrooms, four-and-a-half baths, and a wrap-around terrace.

The property has a price tag of $17.25million, according to a report in the New York Daily News.

Madoff bought the duplex apartment in 1984 and lived there until 2009, spending his last days under house arrest in its lavish surroundings.

Disgraced: Madoff, currently serving a 150-year jail sentence, bought the penthouse in 1984 and spent his last days under house arrest there

The ponzi scheme fraudster is currently serving a 150-year sentence in a prison in North Carolina.

Broker Dolly Lenz, who is handling the sale, told the newspaper: 'It's a one-of-a-kind penthouse - I remember it well.'

Another broker described the property, which features soaring 11ft high ceilings and Palladian windows, as 'very grand'.

It features three bedrooms, a library, a chef's kitchen, and a wraparound terrace with views of Manhattan's Central Park.

It is a world away from Madoff's new residence - the Butner Federal Correctional Complex.

Madoff, 75, was at the helm of a multi-billion dollar empire when he ran his own finance firm.

But his high-flying lifestyle came crashing down in 2008 when it emerged it was being funded by the biggest financial fraud in U.S. history.

The following year Madoff pleaded guilty to siphoning $17.5billion from thousands of investors in a long-running, pyramid-style scam.

Along with his multi-million dollar Manhattan apartment, Madoff said goodbye to luxury properties in Florida and France, a beach house in Montauk, New York, and a yacht called The Bull.

The conman and his wife Ruth were also
 forced to auction off furniture, jewellery and clothes in a bid to 
compensate the victim's of Madoff's scam.

In 2010, on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, Madoff's eldest son Mark took his own life.

The financier had tried to hide the fraud from his family.

Following his arrest in 2008 Madoff was forced to confess that his Wall Street firm was 'one big lie' and amounted to nothing more than a 'giant Ponzi scheme'.

He posted bail of $10million and remained under house arrest at his plush Manhattan home.

In 2009 he was ordered to forfeit $170million in assets.

Madoff was sentenced to 150 years in prison.
