Ed Miliband yesterday became the second political party leader to enter the row over Charles Saatchi assaulting Nigella Lawson.

The Labour leader insisted that he would have intervened had he had seen the millionaire art dealer grabbing his wife by the throat in exclusive London restaurant Scott’s.

His comments came after Nick Clegg was heavily criticised last week for suggesting that the couple’s row could have been ‘just a fleeting thing’.

During a radio interview, the Deputy Prime Minister also failed to condemn Saatchi and refused to say whether he would have stepped in if  he had witnessed the incident.

But Mr Miliband said yesterday: ‘I thought they were horrifying pictures.

‘Honestly, if you are passing by something like that happening, our duty is to intervene.

'If I had been in that situation, passing  by in those circumstances, the right thing to do is to go up to somebody involved in that and say, “What’s going on?” ’

Neil Kinnock also waded into the row by revealing that he would have 'felt compelled' to intervene the row between Nigella and her husband

Yesterday, Neil Kinnock also waded into the row by revealing that he would have ‘felt compelled’ to intervene.

The former Labour leader said: ‘It’s the kind of thing where I would have no hesitation to step in – even if the woman wasn’t Nigella.

‘There is no circumstance in which a man should physically assault a woman.

‘I knew Nigella when she was with her first husband – way back. She’s a lovely woman: joyful, highly intelligent and independently minded.

‘She was superhuman with her first husband.’
