A tech entrepreneur has come under fire after creating a website that encourages lecturers to have sex with their university students.

Tom Thurlow, 23, from Gloucestershire, created shagatuni.com to help students meet like-minded others for casual sex.

Since its opening in September 2012, the site has attracted thousands of users, with 2,000 students signing up per day in its first few months.

Entrepreneur: Tom Thurlow, 23, created Shagatuni.com to help students meet like-minded others for casual sex but has come under fire after many claimed it was 'encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power'

But the website has come under fire after many claimed it was 'encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power', when a recent poll found that more and more were joining.

In a statement on the site Shagatuni said: 'Since the beginning of 2014 we've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors.

'We recently polled 1,773 of our members and over half of them (54 per cent) admitted to having been sexually attracted to their lecturer.

'And of these horny students, three fifths (61 per cent) confessed to indulging in "flirtatious behaviour" with the lecturer in question.

'To put it simply, there are students in vast numbers who want to get it on with the person who stands in front of the blackboard.

In a statement on the site Shagatuni said: 'Since the beginning of 2014 we've seen an even bigger uptake to the site by university professors' - which has caused outrage

'It could be a power thing or perhaps they just prefer someone with experience in the bedroom?

'At ShagAtUni we're extremely accommodating and we see no good reason why not to encourage student and lecturer relations.'

It was followed by a list of advice to lecturers using the site, including the tip: 'Try and avoid hooking up with a student you teach to avoid any discrepancies over exam results or degree grades.

'Lecturers who create an account on ShagAtUni.com during 2014 will now be granted free membership for an entire year (worth £25 per month),' adds the post.

Tom said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students.

'I get that some will find it controversial, but that doesn't mean lecturers and students don't sleep with each other,' he said.

'Shag At Uni is the biggest site for students and sex so it's only right that we lead the way in facilitating this naughty trend.'

But many have slammed the move by the website, with one university lecturer saying he was 'appalled' by the website.

The 31-year-old, who asked not to be named, said: 'I think it's utterly wrong that this website is encouraging lecturers to abuse their positions of power.

Controversial: 'We feel that there are definitely sensible ways to court a relationship that some prudes in society might frown upon,' writes the site. 'So we’ve decided to create our own Code of Conduct for lecturers to use as a guide when using ShagAtUni.com'

'You're 
talking about students who are still finding themselves in life and 
perhaps a bit naive and and this site is, it could be argued, taking 
advantage of them.

'Obviously
 the students have to be looking for it in the first place to join the 
site, so it's not as though they're being seduced, but they're still 
young and could very likely regret getting together with a lecturer 
later in life.'

Abi Thomas, a student from Cheltenham called the website 'creepy'.

The
 20-year-old said: 'I don't agree with what Shag At Uni is doing. 
Personally, I think there should be a line between teachers and 
students.

'It's creepy. Lecturers shouldn't be trawling the internet looking for students for sex.

'I
 know there are students who are 18 and think it's somehow cool and 
daring to sleep with their lecturer, but they'll probably regret it 
later in life, and this is just encouraging them to do it.'

His view: Tom said he saw nothing wrong with encouraging lecturers to sleep with students, adding: 'I get that some will find it controversial, but that doesn't mean lecturers and students don't sleep with each other'

Tom said he got the idea to include lecturers after he came across many who had slept with their own while at university.

He said: 'I know lots of students personally who fancy their lecturers. One (who shall remain nameless) even told me he slept with his twice.

'So this got me searching on my site for this trend. Lo and behold he isn't the only one getting some extracurricular.'

Explaining how the site works for lecturers, he added: 'So they can browse through the users of my site just like a student can.

'When they find one that takes their fancy, they can message and arrange a hook up. Lecturers can also message us and get free membership for the rest of this year as I'm currently trying to get more and more of them using Shag At Uni.'
