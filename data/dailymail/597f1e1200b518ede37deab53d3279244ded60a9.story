The Duke of Cambridge today admitted that he is a fan of the BBC show Dragons' Den as he awarded businessman and former panelist James Caan a CBE.

James Caan, who visited the palace today to receive the honour, said it was 'amazing' to meet William and admitted he was thrilled to find out that the prince was a regular viewer. 

William was making his final UK appearance at the investiture ceremony ahead of his visit to China and Japan, with the Prince set to fly to Tokyo on Thursday.

James Caan received a CBE at Buckingham Palace today that was presented to him by Prince William who admitted that he was a fan of Dragons Den 

The business mogul received a CBE for services to entrepreneurship and charitable services through his James Caan Foundation.

James, 54, who was born in Pakistan but moved to the UK aged two and now resides in London, said: 'He said to me "we miss you on Dragons' Den"'.

It is not clear who the 'we' refers to but it suggest that the Duke might enjoy the show with his wife the Duchess of Cambridge, Kate - unless of course it is the royal 'we'. 

The entrepreneur added that it was a delight to meet the Prince and it served as a reminder of the importance of British heritage.   

He said: 'It was amazing to meet the Duke. He is just so charming.'

James continued: 'I just adore the British history and culture and the whole formality of today. 

'We should treasure this in this country.'

The entrepreneur was one of the formidable judges on the BBC television programme from 2007 until 2010.

And the former dragon says he is still struck by some of the more outlandish inventions pitched to him on the show.

'I remember a couple who came on the show because they felt married couples don't get a good night's sleep because the woman moves over to the husband or vice versa.

'They felt the way to solve that issue was to invent a white sheet with a black line down the middle. 

'I thought, why don't you just use a ruler?

'It's a good reminder of some of the crazy ideas you get in the den.'

Despite leaving the show five years ago James revealed that, like William, he tunes in to Dragons' Den regularly. 

And the entrepreneur is looking forward to seeing the new judging line-up after panelists Duncan Bannatyne and Kelly Hoppen announced their departure from the show.

He said: 'I think it's good to change things and dragons. Once you have been on the show for a while it becomes bland because you can anticipate each other.

'Any time a new dragon comes in it makes it more edgy.' 

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge often like to spend time at home watching television when not undertaking official duties. 

In the past, the royal couple has revealed themselves to be fans of the TV dramas Homeland and Downton Abbey, as well as the ITV talent show X Factor. 

Nikki Gewirtz was one of the honorees at Buckingham Palace today 

The Duke of Cambridge was on cheerful form today as he took part in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. 

Resplendent in a gold-braided uniform, the 32-year-old smiled broadly as he welcomed honorees to the Palace, among them Nikki Gewirtz, the 44-year-old founder of jewellery brand, Lola Rose.

Ms Gewirtz, whose pieces are a favourite with the Duchess of Cambridge as well as numerous celebrities, joins an exclusive club of designers honoured by the Palace, most famously Vivienne Westwood and Alice Temperley.

Speaking to MailOnline, Gewirtz says she was 'absolutely delighted and humbled' to spot her name on the New Year's Honours list, which also included actresses Joan Collins and Sheridan Smith.

'I am absolutely delighted and humbled,' said the ecstatic designer. 'The fashion industry has been incredibly supportive and to be joining the ranks of such eminent talent is an honour.'

Now Gewirtz, who was presented with an MBE, is hoping her unexpected success will encourage other budding designers to follow in her footsteps.

'I believe that we must celebrate British designers,' she explains. 'We have some of the finest in the world.

'It's the ability to think outside the box and break rules that results in the extraordinary and as a nation, we shine at turning things on their head and coming up with something unique.'

Among the designers to have honours bestowed on them in recent years are Betty Jackson who in 1987 was handed an MBE and in 2007 a CBE.

Alice Temperley and Anya Hindmarch have both been handed gongs, as has Vivienne Westwood who turned up to collect her MBE in 1992 wearing no knickers beneath her dress.

She repeated the trick for a second time in 2006 when she was invited to Buckingham Palace to collect a Damehood from Prince Charles.

Luckily for the Duke of Cambridge, Gehwirtz had no such inclinations and the investiture ceremony, which is usually done by the Queen or Prince Charles, passed off smoothly.

On Thursday, the prince will fly to Tokyo for the start of a six-day tour that will also take him, for the first time, to Beijing.

During his visit, which will involve a trip on one of Japan's legendary bullet trains, he will be introduced to his Japanese opposite number - Prince Hisahito of Akishino.

The meeting is not expected to be particularly formal, however, as Prince Hisahito is just eight years old.

After Japan, he will travel on to China where he will visit Beijing and Shanghai.
