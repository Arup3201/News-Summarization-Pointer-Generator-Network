A son was killed in a car crash as he raced to hospital to visit his mother who had already died in a road accident several hours before.

Mary Moore, 45, died when she was struck by a vehicle on Sunday while lying in the road after it was believed she had been drinking.

Her 24-year-old son Thomas Olson was killed several hours later when the car he was traveling in hit three parked cars and flipped over in West Allis, Wisconsin.

According to West
Allis Deputy Chief Charles Padgett, Mr Olson may not have been 
aware that his mother had already died when he was rushing to see her.

The driver of the car the young man was riding 
in was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated. He and two 
other passengers suffered non-life-threatening injuries.

Mrs Moore was hit after it was believed she was lying drunk in the street.

A motorist following the car that struck
her told police it looked as though the vehicle hit a speed bump, 
according to the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's report.

The witness did not realize that it was a person until getting closer, the report said.

Deputy Padgett said: 'It's emotional. We want to get there fast and sometimes disregard our safety.

'I use it to remind people that regardless of the circumstances, be aware of the speed.'

Padgett said Mrs Moore had been drinking before she was hit, but it's not clear how much. An autopsy was expected to be carried out today.

The driver that hit the woman drove off, but officers later found and arrested a suspect. That driver may also have been drinking, authorities said.

Deputy Padgett added: 'In my 24 years (of law enforcement), I've seen a lot of strange things, but don't specifically remember a case like this.'
