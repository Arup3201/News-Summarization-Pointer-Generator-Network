These incredible images show a thrill-seeking climber scaling some of the last remaining ice above the clouds on Africa’s highest mountain.

Professional climber Will Gadd and his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and he may be one of the last to ever scale the crumbling ice wall.

Some scientists are predicting that the ice will disappear completely by 2020 due to climate change.

Professional climber Will Gadd and three other members of his team hiked for a week to reach the remote precipice on Mount Kilimanjaro

Mr Gadd may be one of the last to ever scale the receding ice wall as some experts believe the ice will completely disappear by 2020

After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will Gadd said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind'

Mr Gadd said he felt lucky to complete the climb as the receding glaciers 'are just small remnants truly in their last grasp'

After completing the climb at an altitude of more than 19,500ft, Will said: ‘I've climbed a lot of ice, but this was the last of its kind.

‘The glaciers are just small remnants truly in their last gasp. I felt very lucky to be there.’

The team – consisting of Will, climbing partner Sarah Hueniken, photographer Christian Pondella, and videographer Pablo Durana – had to cope with extreme challenges that put their bodies under incredible stress.

Everyone on the team had to battle altitude sickness and sleepless nights.

The team had to cope with extreme challenges, including altitude sickness and sleepless nights, while scaling Africa's highest mountain

By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, Will became one of the first people in the modern era to scale the receding ice

Will said: ‘You'd just fall asleep and then wake up gasping for breath.

‘We didn't have weeks and weeks to acclimate to the altitude, it's too expensive to stay on the mountain, so we definitely pushed ourselves physically. Fortunately it all worked out OK.’

By climbing several overhanging and vertical glacier remnants, each up to 200ft high, Will became one of the first people in the modern era – and possibly last – to scale the receding ice.

Will Gadd said it was the 'wildest ice' he has encountered with ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand and overhanging prows

Will Gadd said the team pushed themselves physically because they didn't spend enough time acclimatising to the altitude

Will Gadd said the ice was 'literally disappearing in front of my eyes' as he scaled a frozen wall near the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro

Will added: ‘It was the wildest ice I've ever seen.

‘Ice fins sticking out of a desert of hot sand at 19,000 feet, overhanging prows that creaked while I climbed them, and so many wild possibilities blasted into crazy shapes by the high-altitude tropical sun.

‘The ice I climbed was literally disappearing in front of my eyes. None of what I climbed will survive another month.

‘Unfortunately, due to climate change, there won't be any ice on Kilimanjaro in the near future.

‘Kilimanjaro used to have ice over the entire summit plateau, but now there are only a few small glaciers remaining, and they are disappearing very fast.’
