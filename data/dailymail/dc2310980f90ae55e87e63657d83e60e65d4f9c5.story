Former winner Scott Waites came close to a shock exit from the BDO World Championship at the hands of debutant Sam Hewson at Lakeside.

The 2013 champion was beaten at the first hurdle last year by Alan Norris and had to battle back from a set down to beat the 21-year-old.

'There were a couple of sloppy darts but, in between, my darts were fantastic,' Waites, who is nursing a shoulder injury, told BT Sport. 'That's the best I've played for months.

'I'm quite happy with that and if I can do that for the next few rounds, you never know.'

There were also first-round victories for England's Brian Dawson, Karel Sedlacek of the Czech Republic and Canada's Jeff Smith.
