It might be based on Native American culture... but not as we know it: A motel owner in California is offering accommodation in wigwams that will never blow over... as they're made from concrete.

Frank Redford, originally from Kentucky, created his chain of Native American inspired motels in 1935, and they continue attract masses of people every year.

The motel sits in San Bernadino, California, along the famous Route 66, and is one of only three out of the seven originals that still remain.

Teepee or not teepee? The concrete wigwams are based on Native American culture... but with all mod cons

The winter of our discount tent: Motel owner Frank Redford first created his chain of native Indian inspired motels in 1935

His innovative idea began when he built a teepee shaped building to display a collection of Native American historical items.

He went on to create several more teepees, dubbed 'Wigwam village', especially for travellers to stay in.

The motel proved to be a huge success and another six wigwam villages were built in the south and south western areas of America by the early 1950s.

But only three of the 25ft tall wigwam motels remain, with other versions still going strong in Arizona and Kentucky.

Too intense? The Californa site off Route 66 boasts a pool and BBQ area too

Frank said: 'The motel attracts all kinds of guests. We have all types of people from folks from southern California to out of state, and tourists from other countries.'

The wigwams are painted in white with a classic red zig-zag border and surround the motel's main office and gift shop.

Each wigwam boasts a private bathroom, wifi, TV, telephone and fridge while the main site includes a swimming pool and BBQ area.

Prices at the quirky motel range from £40 to £58 a night.
