A crack-smoking homeless man accused of trying to have sex with a train seat has been acquitted of indecent exposure. 

Leslie Bailey, 28, was arrested on May 8, in San Fransisco, after a train operator caught him on his knees in the first carriage thrusting his pelvis against a seat. 

Bailey then began gyrating on his stomach before he flipped over and began masturbating while having a toke on his crack pipe.

When he eventually realised he had been caught, he apologised to the operator for smoking but his genitals were still hanging out from underneath his shirt. 

The incident happened on a Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) train travelling from Dublin-Pleasanton.

Bailey was arrested by police and his crack pipe was confiscated. 

Bailey's attorney, Emily Dahm, said Baily had been taking anti-psychotic medication and binging on crack cocaine.

She argued that he was trying to have a private moment on the nearly empty carriage and that he was not trying to attract public attention. 

Prosecutors must prove that the defendant was seeking attention to successfully have someone convicted of felony indecent exposure. 

Court records show that Bailey was convicted of felony indecent exposure in 2007 in San Francisco.

However, he was convicted of misdemeanor lewd acts and released. 

It is not known if the seat in question has been removed from the train.

This is not the first time people have been known to get up close and personal with a mode of transport.

Edward Smith, from Washington State, admitted having sex with 1,000 cars back in 2008.

He claimed to first have sex with a car at the age of 15 and said he had never been attracted to men or women.

His 'girlfriend' at the time was a white Volkswagen Beetle named Vanilla.

Daniel Cooper, 24, from Wales, was banned from going out at night in September after he stripped naked and simulated a sex act against a Land Rover Discovery.

Cooper, of Springfields, Holywell, admitted indecent exposure when he appeared at Flintshire Magistrates Court sitting at Mold.

He was given a three-month community order which banned him from going outdoors between 7pm and 7am on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights for three months.

He was also ordered to pay £85 costs.

One of his friends at the time said: 'Daniel will never live this down - everyone is saying he was tyred and exhausted afterwards.'
