British style icon Paul Smith has helped to redesign one of this country's most distinctive cars before production is stopped later this year.

These pictures show the stunning one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender produced by Sir Paul, who has been a fan of the 4x4 for years and owns several of them.

The bodywork features 27 different coloured panels based on British woodlands and colours used by the British Army, while the interior is covered with bespoke leather and fabrics made by Sir Paul.

Striking: Designed Sir Paul Smith custom made this one-of-a-kind Land Rover Defender to celebrate the iconic car ahead of it going out of production at the end of the year

Patchwork: The body panels are painted a total of 27 different colours, and Sir Paul said he took inspiration from the countryside and British Army vehicles for the design

Historic: The modern-day Defender is a descendant of the first ever car made by Land Rover, the Series 1, and has been in production since 1948

The designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said: 'The Defender is a British icon, which is something I’m exceptionally proud of.

'This is a complete one-off; I wanted to give this Defender a feeling of luxury, so I used a mix of leather and fabric for the seats. 

'I actually used the fabric that I design for Maharam, the American upholstery company.

'I wanted deep, rich colours, but at the same time, I wanted them to work together yet be surprising. My designs are known for their attention to detail, so I didn't want this Defender to be any different.'

Luxurious: Sir Paul chose bespoke leather for the interior, and had the seats made out of fabric he disgnes himself for an American fashion-house

Pedigree: Since 1948 around 15.million Defenders have been produced, and it is thought that as many as two thirds of those are still on the road somewhere in the world

Detailing: The London designer, who was knighted in 2000 and has dressed the likes of Bradley Wiggins and the England football team, said attention to detail was key in making the Defender

Included on the car are two Paul Smith logos. One inside a clock on the dashboard, and another below the Land Rover logo on the back.

The modern-day defender is a descendant of Land Rover's first ever off-road vehicle, which was launched back in 1948, making it the world's oldest car still to be in production.

Named the Series 1, the original design was sketched in sand on Anglesey beach by Rover's chief engineer Maurice Wilkes.

Popular: Sir Paul called the car 'a British icon' and is known to be a fan, having owned several of them

Hand delivered: The Defender is seen parked outside the Paul Smith store in London's upmarket Mayfair

Since then Land Rover has sold 1.5million of the vehicles, and, of those, it is said that two thirds of them remain on the roads somewhere in the world.

According to the Birmingham Mail, the Solihull factory that produces the Defender has had to ramp up production by 50 per cent to cope with orders flooding in before it is discontinued in December.

Gerry McGovern, design director and chief creative officer of Land Rover, added: 'I felt it would be a fitting tribute to the iconic Defender, that one of Britain's most distinguished designers worked with the Land Rover team to recognise his creative vision.'
