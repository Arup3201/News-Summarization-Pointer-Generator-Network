Pressure: Former Labour human rights envoy Ann Clwyd said she felt 'considerable revulsion'

More senior Labour figures came forward last night to heap pressure on Ed Miliband, demanding a judge-led inquiry into allegations that Britain was complicit in torture.

MPs and peers, including Tony Blair’s former envoy to Iraq, insisted a formal probe led by a judge was needed to get to the truth and ensure public trust in its conclusions.

The Labour leader continues to back a probe by Parliament’s Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), despite it having already cleared the security services of involvement in extraordinary rendition in an earlier probe which was condemned as a whitewash.

On Monday several MPs insisted a judge-led investigation was the only way to clear up the questions posed by an explosive US Senate report into torture by the CIA.

The report was redacted to remove any mention of MI5, MI6 or Diego Garcia, the British base used by at least two rendition flights.

Critics say the ISC does not have the power to uncover the extent of the involvement and knowledge of the security and intelligence agencies and what former Labour ministers including Tony Blair, Jack Straw and David Miliband knew.

Ann Clwyd, who was Mr Blair’s human rights envoy to Iraq and now chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group on Human Rights, said she felt ‘considerable revulsion’ at the Senate report’s conclusions.

She said: ‘I felt so angry and repelled. This has been rumbling on for some time and we are still none the wiser about Britain’s alleged role. It seems to me the ISC doesn’t have sufficient powers.

‘Somebody in Britain read the report to get the redactions and we need to find out who that was. We need a judge-led inquiry to take evidence on oath and get to the bottom of what’s happened.’

Former Labour minister Lord Dubs, who sat on the Joint Committee on Human Rights when it investigated allegations of UK complicity in torture in 2009, said a judge-led inquiry was ‘almost inevitable’, adding: ‘The ISC is limited in what it can do, what documents it can see or who it can call to give evidence. A judge-led inquiry would be a better way of doing things and gain more public acceptance.

‘On the human rights committee, we investigated this issue and we simply could not pin anything down and did not have the authority to demand answers.

‘In the end, the allegations of complicity in torture are so serious, so appalling, that an inquiry has to be seen to be done properly with no hint of a cover-up, and this can only be done by a judge.’

Shadow Attorney General Lord Bach asked whether the ISC had the ‘capacity and resources’ to investigate, while Labour MP Glenda Jackson said: ‘There should be a judicial inquiry into this. It’s something that I feel the whole country should be assured of and an inquiry is the only way to do that given the mistrust of all parliamentarians.’

Tony Blair could refuse to give evidence to a judge-led inquiry into British complicity in torture.

Mr Blair, who was prime minister when the UK territory of Diego Garcia was used for at least two rendition flights, has signalled he would be willing to appear before the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC).

But there are concerns that the ISC, which can allow witnesses to testify in secret, has insufficient powers to get to the truth.

His spokesman declined to speculate on whether he would be prepared to face a grilling by a judge-led inquiry, raising the possibility that he would decline to testify in public unless compelled.

Mr Blair has been accused of trying to cover up the UK’s involvement in CIA wrongdoing.

But a spokesman said: ‘Tony Blair has always been opposed to the use of torture, has always said so publicly and privately, and thinks it is totally unacceptable.’ 

Labour backbencher Katy Clark said it was ‘vital’ the inquiry into what Britain knew about abuse of detainees was run by a judge.

In 2010, David Cameron ordered Sir Peter Gibson to head the Detainee Inquiry to look into the claims that the intelligence services were complicit in torture. But it was suspended after two years while police investigated claims MI6 was involved in the extraordinary rendition of two Libyans.

Politicians from all sides and human rights campaigners have insisted the ISC probe, which replaced Gibson, is inadequate. But ministers say it should be allowed to complete the task.

On Sunday, Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said she doubted the ISC had the capacity and the scope to carry out an inquiry and her ‘instinct’ was that a judge-led process was needed. But she stopped short of backing a full judicial investigation.

Mr Miliband’s aides said on Monday that the Labour leader agreed with Miss Cooper and had ‘some concerns’ about the ISC ‘but we need to see the way the Government sets that out’.

Yesterday a Labour spokesman said the party’s position had not changed, adding: ‘As Yvette said at the weekend, there continues to be a case for an independent inquiry.’
