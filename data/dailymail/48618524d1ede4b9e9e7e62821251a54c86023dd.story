A would-be bride who killed her husband-to-be on their wedding day has been sentenced to life in prison, but claims she still loves him.

Na Cola Franklin, 32, from Eastern Pennsylvania was convicted of first-degree murder in the death of 36-year-old Billy Brewster, last August.

Franklin and her fianc√© had been arguing in the early hours on August 11 2012, just hours before the ceremony.

Murder: Na Cola Franklin, left was convicted of killing her husband-to-be Billy Brewster, right, after stabbing him twice in the heart during an argument at their home

Brewster was found bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am in the home they shared with three children.

Before she was sentenced to a mandatory life term, Franklin said she hadn't meant to kill Brewster.

Franklin told the victim's mother, Barbara Obas, in court, 'I love him. I do still love him. I love him more than myself.'

Speaking in the courtroom, in a calm, clear voice, Mrs Obas said her hardworking son had lots of plans, from marrying Franklin, to finding a gang-free school for their children, to finding a better job to provide for his new family.

'You killed him because you could ... you took advantage of him. You showed no concern for the father of your son,' Obas said.

Brewster and Franklin each had sons from prior relationships and a son together. The children were present the night of the stabbing.

'A mother killed dad with the children watching,' Obas said. 'In doing that you also took your own life.'

Defense attorney John Waldron has 
vowed to appeal. He argues Brewster came home drunk from an impromptu 
bachelor party and attacked Franklin.

He claimed that Brewster attacked Franklin and then tried to leave with the couple's 9-month-old son.

Waldron argued Franklin, 32, grabbed a knife to protect her child.

But prosecutors say that the child was not in danger, and claimed that Franklin showed no signs of being assaulted by Brewster.

Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his 
wife Monique - who were staying at the home with his wife for the 
wedding - testified that Franklin was the one being violent, and they 
never saw Brewster hit her.

Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children

The couple said that after returning 
to the apartment shortly after midnight, they overheard an argument 
between Brewster and Franklin.

When Mr Kali went to see what was 
going on, he got in between the fighting couple and tried to break up 
the argument. Mrs Kali only entered the fight when she heard someone 
scream 'knife'.

Scene: The fight took place inside the apartment around 2am on Saturday morning, just eight hours before the couple were due to be married

After seeing blood on the left side 
of Brewster's chest and her husband standing in between Brewster and the
knife-wieldling Franklin, Mrs Kali said she 'instinctively tackled' the
woman.

During the episode, an injured 
Brewster crawled to the outdoor landing of the home, where police found 
him when they arrived on the scene. An hour and a half later, he was 
dead.
