A church handed a noise abatement notice after neighbours complained it was 'like living next door to a nighclub'- has now applied for a late licence.

Locals living next to the 13th century St James the Great Church in Thorley, Hertfordshire, claimed it was making their lives 'hell' after they were plagued by loud music, rowdy  parties and drunken shouting from its wedding venue. 

Church leaders had promised to keep it down at their Grade II-listed St Barnabas Centre after the order by East Hertforshire District Council last November.

But it emerged this week that St James, run by the Church of England and overseen by Diocese of St Albans, has applied for a licence to serve alcohol and host gigs up until midnight at another centre in its grounds.

A neighbour, who would not be named, said: 'It's been hell living here for several years now and the worst of it is that the Church of England actively promotes the barns for parties and weddings. 

'There have been more and more parties over the last few years and it's getting to the stage that we are using the Lord's name in vain when we hear the music or the wedding speeches.

'We don't want to upset the church, but we don't want drunken wedding guests wandering around shouting outside out houses.' 

Locals claimed that another late night venue at the church would make things 'ten times worse'.

Churchwarden Clive Weir admitted neighbours had 'good grounds' for complaint and said church leaders are now investigating soundproofing at St Barnabas Centre.

He said: 'There is no argument - we completely agree with them.

'The problem has been finding a satisfactory solution to abate the noise emitting from a grade II listed barn. Our acoustic consultants have advised us that we are now near a solution that will satisfy acoustic regulations.'  

A spokesman for East Hertfordshire District Council added it would give the church time to sort out its current 'noise issues' before stepping in.

Neighbours to the church in Thorley, Hertfordshire complained to East Hertfordshire District Council that they are plagued by 'loud music', wedding parties, drunken shouting, amplified speeches, and live music

The source of the noise is the 16th century Tudor barn in the grounds of the church (pictured) which can be hired out through the Church of England for weddings, parties, school concerts, craft fairs and various other bashes, but it has now emerged the church has applied for a late license at another one of its venues

She said: 'We've given them until the start of the wedding season to try to resolve the noise issues.' 

But neighbours were furious the church had also applied to host parties at the nearby Emmaus Centre which is normally used for children's parties.  

Richard Timmis, whose home Thorley Hall is opposite the church, said said: 'The use as a church is not a problem - it's all these events they have - we hear the music the whole time.

'They have a terrace at the back which people sit out on and we get a lot of noise and disturbance from that.'

He added the late licence application, if approved, would make the noise 'ten times worse'.

'We would have people not just on the terrace but milling around between the two buildings with no enclosure to mute it,' he added. 

Another neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It's been like living opposite a nightclub.

'It sometimes feels like we're actually in there, being able to hear the words of every song, and the doors and windows shaking from the heavy bass.

'It's been stressful for us all knowing we have weekend after weekend of disturbance to endure and sometimes just not wanting to be at home at a time when we should be able to relax.'

Thorley Parish Council have also lodged their objections with concerns over noise and traffic. 

The local district council has given St James the Great until wedding season to sort out the noise issues, with church leaders promising to investigate soundproofing
