A man who was allegedly killed by James 'Whitey' Bulger predicted he would be killed if Bulger learned he'd been cooperating with authorities, a former FBI agent testified on Monday.

Retired agent Gerald Montanari told jurors in Bulger's racketeering case that Edward 'Brian' Halloran became an FBI informant in 1982 and agreed to testify against Bulger and members of his gang in the 1981 slaying of Tulsa, Okla., businessman Roger Wheeler, as well as other killings.

Halloran was facing a state murder charge and hoped his cooperation would help him in that case — and secure protection for himself and his family.

James 'Whitey' Bulger: He was one of the nation's most wanted fugitives after he fled Boston in 1994. He was finally captured two years ago in Santa Monica, California and faces 32 counts, including 19 murder charges

Halloran told the former agent Bulger 
or his partner, Stephen 'The Rifleman' Flemmi, would probably kill him 
if they found out he was cooperating, Montanari said.

'He
said that if Bulger or Flemmi had any indication that he was 
cooperating with the FBI that they would go to any extreme, even if it 
meant killing innocent bystanders, including his family,' Montanari 
said.

Bulger is charged with
opening fire on a car Halloran was in a few months after he turned 
informant. Halloran and Michael Donahue, an acquaintance who had offered
him a ride home, were killed.

Bulger,
83, has pleaded not guilty to participating in 19 killings during the 
1970s and '80s while he allegedly led the Winter Hill Gang.

He
has also denied prosecutors' assertions that he was a longtime FBI 
informant who ratted on the rival New England Mafia and other criminals.

Murdered: Edward Brian Halloran reached out to the FBI in 1981 about a murder Whitey Bulger had been involved in. By 1982 he was shot dead as he was being driven home by a friend

Montanari
said Halloran was a 'mid-level strong-arm type' who acted as an 
enforcer for the gang. He said Halloran reached out to the FBI at the 
end of 1981 about Wheeler's death.

The FBI made arrangements for Halloran and his family to live in a rented house on Cape Cod to protect him, Montanari said.

He
said the FBI believed if Halloran abided by the guidelines given to 
him, including that he not go to Boston, 'we felt this would be 
sufficient security for him.'

Montanari
said he and another agent met with Halloran dozens of times over a 
period of two to three months, and he told them about various crimes he 
said were committed by Bulger, Flemmi, hit man John Martorano and 
others.

Halloran had agreed 
to wear a recording device to capture conversations he had with a Bulger
associate who played a role in the Wheeler killing, Montanari said.

Prosecutors
say Bugler learned of Halloran's cooperation through former FBI agent 
John Connolly, who was Bulger's handler while he was an FBI informant. 
Halloran was gunned down in May 1982, near a restaurant in South Boston.

Montanari
said the FBI told Halloran before his death that they were closing him 
as an informant because he would not take a lie detector test and was 
waffling on whether to go into the witness protection program.

In
other testimony Monday, Martorano's former girlfriend, Patricia 
Carlson, described living with Martorano while he was on the run after 
he was indicted in the late 1970s.

Carlson,
who was then Patricia Lytle, said she began dating Martorano when she 
was 15 and he was 35. She said one day he asked her if she wanted to go 
to Florida for a vacation. 'We ended up staying there 20 years,' she 
said.

They had a son together, James Stephen, now 27. Martorano testified earlier that his son was named after Bulger and Flemmi.

Carlson
described a series of cash payments she received from Bulger's gang, 
including a $10,000 payment that was left at her mother's house in July 
1996 after Martorano was arrested.

She also testified that she told numerous lies when she appeared before a federal grand jury in 1995.

'I
was worried that I was going to cause more problems for Johnny. I was 
concerned with what was going to happen with my 8-year-old boy, and 
Johnny told me to lie,' she said.

Carlson
said she only recently admitted she lied after she spoke to her 
attorney and he told her that the statute of limitations for perjury had
expired.

Under 
cross-examination by Bulger attorney Hank Brennan, Carlson said that up 
until last month, the government had not contacted her since her 1995 
grand jury testimony to provide information about Martorano's illegal 
activities.

In other 
testimony, Dr. Richard Evans, the retired chief medical examiner for 
Massachusetts, reviewed reports in all 19 killings and listed the cause 
of death for each one. He said most of the victims had multiple gunshot 
wounds.
