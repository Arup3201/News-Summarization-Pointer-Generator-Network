Police investigating the murder of a former Miss Venezuela and her British husband have arrested a teenager over his alleged involvement in the highway robbery.

Gerardo Jose Contreras, 19, was detained in the western state of Yaracuy yesterday, according to Attorney General Luisa Ortega Diaz.

Monica Spear, 29, and her 39-year-old husband Thomas Berry, from London, were slain in January 2014 when they resisted a robbery attempt while stranded on a lonely stretch of highway.

An 11th suspect has been arrested in connection with the killing of Monica Spear, seen here competing in the Miss Universe competition in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2005

They were killed in cold blood after being robbed when their car broke down on the Puerto-Cabello to Valencia highway at around 10pm on January 6. 

Armed men surrounded the Toyota Corolla while the couple waited for a repair truck, and the terrified pair locked themselves in but the robbers opened fire through the windows.

The bodies of Mr Berry and Ms Spear, who had American citizenship, were found in the car with their then five-year-old daughter Maya, who survived despite being shot in the leg. 

She suffered a glancing wound and was treated in hospital but did not require any surgery. 

In September, three men were each sentenced to more than 20 years in prison for the killing. 

Contreras is the 11th suspect to be detained and faces charges including homicide and aggravated robbery.

Mr Berry's British-born parents moved to Venezuela 30 years ago, while Ms Spear's parents live in Florida. 

Monica Spear lived in Venezuela for a few years as a child but their family moved to Florida, and she eventually graduated from the University of Central Florida.

She was named Miss Venezuela in 2004 and then came in fourth place at the Miss Universe competition the next year. 

She was also a well-known soap actress in Venezuela, starring in the popular 'Forbidden Pleasures' show.

Ms Spear and Mr Berry had reportedly separated a year before their death but remained close and went on vacations together to spend time with their daughter.

They were on one such trip touring the country during the week leading up to the attack and their friends thought that it may lead to a reunion.

Police have attributed the fatal attack to the damaging of Venezuela's moral fibre as a result of the dramatic telenovelas like the one that Ms Spears starred in.

The oil-rich has one of the world's highest homicide rates.

The couple locked themselves in their car but the robbers fired through the windows, killing them both 

Three men have already been sentenced to more than 20 years in prison each over the killings
