Release: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been released from a civilian hospital

The surviving suspect in the Boston marathon bombings has been released from a civilian hospital and transferred to a federal medical detention center in central Massachusetts.

The U.S. Marshals Service said today that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev left Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center overnight and was taken to the Federal Medical Center Devens about 40 miles west of Boston.

The minimum security facility, on the decommissioned Fort Devens U.S. Army base, treats federal prisoners and detainees who require specialized long-term medical or mental health care.

It has been referred to in the past as 'agreeable' and 'fairly pleasant'.

It is designated as an administrative facility, which means it has inmates from different security classifications, from white-collar criminals to mobsters and sex offenders.

The medical center currently houses 1,000 inmates with 124 in a minimum-security satellite prison camp. It costs around $157 for each inmate per day.

According to its website, these minimum security prison camps, have dormitory housing, a relatively low staff-to-inmate ratio, and limited or no perimeter fencing.

They are usually work-and-program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs of the larger institution or base.

Former NYPD officer William Masso, former New Jersey assemblyman Daniel Van Pelt and one time Underworld mafia boss John Franzese, 96, are currently inmates there.

The medical center inmates are often allowed to leave the facility to see outside specialists and for tests and medical procedures not available in the medical center.

The Federal Bureau of Prisons is focused on preventing rehabilitation by encouraging inmates to participate in a range of programs that have been proven to reduce repeat offending.

The level of security which Tsarnaev will be held under depends on his changing circumstances - because he is a pretrial inmate - and he has no set protocol at this time.

Tsarnaev will have access to medical and dental care, and the prison's handbook states that inmates have the right to a healthy, nutritious diet, as well as information about staying healthy while behind bars.

Tsarnaev said he was behind the devastating terrorist attack. He spoke to police from his hospital bed. Whether suspected terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a controversial issue in the U.S

Reflecting on the scenes of destruction at Boston marathon, Vice President Joe Biden condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis'

Yesterday Tsarnaev admitted to his role in the attacks to the FBI - but clammed up when finally read his Miranda rights.

The minimum security facility, on the
decommissioned Fort Devens U.S. Army base, treats federal prisoners and
detainees who require specialized long-term medical or mental health 
care.

It is designated as an administrative
facility, which means it has inmates from different security 
classifications, from white-collar criminals to mobsters and sex 
offenders.

The medical center currently houses 1,000 inmates with 130 in a minimum-security satellite prison camp.

According to its website, these 
minimum security prison camps have dormitory housing, a relatively low 
staff-to-inmate ratio and limited or no perimeter fencing. They are 
usually work and program oriented and inmates help serve the labor needs
of the larger institution or base.

The medical center inmates are often 
allowed to leave the facility to see outside specialists and for tests 
and medical procedures not available in the medical center.

The prison has regular onsite specialists in cardiology, nephrology, endocrinology, surgery, neurology and pulmonology.

Current and former inmates are:

John Franzese, 96, former Underboss of the Colombo crime family in New York City. He is currently serving an eight-year sentence for racketeering conspiracy in 2011. He is also suspected in numerous Mafia-related murders.

Daniel Van Pelt, 48, a member of the New Jersey State Assembly from 2008-2009. He is currently serving a 41-month sentence for bribery. He was arrested in 2010 for accepting $10,000 to provide environmental permits for a development project.

Sabri Benkahla, 38, member of the Virginia jihad network. He is currently serving a ten-year sentence for perjury and obstruction of justice after he was convicted of lying to FBI agents and a grand jury about a training camp run by Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Pakistani terrorist organization with ties to al-Qaeda.

William Masso, former NYPD officer. He is currently serving a 57-month sentence after he pleaded guilty to conspiracy charges in 2012 for leading a gun trafficking ring comprised of active and retired police officers.

It
has been revealed that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev,Â  initially confessed to 
authorities that he and his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, 
carried out the attacks during 16-hours of questioning over the weekend.

Dzhokhar has been communicating with 
law enforcement officials by writing on a pad after suffering an injury 
to his throat during the frenzied manhunt for him which renders him 
unable to talk.

However,
the moment he was read his rights on Monday - which as a citizen of the
United States entitle him to the constitutional right to remain silent 
and seek a lawyer - he stopped communicating.

Indeed,
it has been claimed that federal agents were surprised when a 
magistrate judge and a representative from the U.S. Attorney's office 
entered the hospital room and read Tsarnaev his rights, four officials 
and one law enforcement official said.

Investigators had planned to keep questioning him.

This apparent confusion came after the White House decided against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant.

It is unclear as to whether this will 
matter in court as the FBI says Tsarnaev has already confessed to a witness.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz said: 'Before being advised of his rights, 
the 19-year-old suspect told authorities that his older brother, 
Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, only recently had recruited him to be part of the
attack'.

The debate over whether suspected 
terrorists should be read their Miranda rights has become a sticking point.

Many Repuplicans believe they hinder intelligence gathering.

The Department of Justice has said 
investigators may wait until they have gathered intelligence about other
threats before reading those rights in terrorism cases.

Investigators have found 
pieces of remote-control equipment among the debris and are analyzing 
them, officials said.

One official described the detonator as 'close-controlled,' meaning it had to be triggered within several blocks of the bombs.

Dzhokhar is recovering in a hospital 
from injuries suffered during a getaway attempt last Friday.

Police had 
previously said Dzhokhar exchanged gunfire with them for more than an 
hour last Friday before they captured him inside a boat in a suburban Boston neighbourhood.

A piece of remote control equipment has been found amongst the debris at the scene of the bombing. Experts say it would have been triggered just blocks away from the site of the bomb

Confused reports about the shootout in a Boston backyard have emerged. Officials now claim that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was unarmed as he hid in boat in Watertown. This contradicts Boston Police Commissioner's account of hour-long firefight with Tsarnaev

But yesterday, two unnamed officials 
said that he was unarmed when captured, raising questions 
about the gunfire and how he was injured.

The report contradicts the Boston police department's own account of Dzhokar Tsarnaev's capture - after commissioner Ed Davies describes a firefight between him and officers before the terror suspect was captured.

More than 4,000 mourners at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology paid tribute to a campus police 
officer who authorities say was gunned down by the bombing 
suspects.

Among the speakers in Cambridge, just outside Boston, was Vice 
President Joe Biden, who condemned the bombing suspects as 'two twisted,
perverted, cowardly, knockoff jihadis.'

Mr Biden paid tribute to officer Sean Collier's family: 'The moment will come when the memory of 
Sean is triggered and you know it's going to be OK. The purpose of 
terror is to instill fear. You saw none of it here in Boston.
Boston, you sent a powerful message to the world.'

Investigators have said the 
brothers appeared to have been radicalized through jihadist materials on
the Internet and have found no evidence tying them to a terrorist 
group.

Dzhokhar told the FBI that they were angry about the U.S. wars in 
Afghanistan and Iraq and the killing of Muslims there, officials said.
