David Beckham burst into floods of tears as he played his final ever game as a professional footballer in Paris this evening.

The 38-year-old was given the honour of captaining Paris St Germain during their final home game of the season against Brest and paid an emotional farewell as he brought the curtain down on a career spanning more than 20 years.

With his wife Victoria and their four children Romeo, Brooklyn, Cruz and Harper, watching from the stand, Beckham was given a standing ovation by players and fans from both sides as he left the pitch to be substituted in the second half.

A visibly upset Beckham was inconsolable as he left the field on 81 minutes.

The game came to an impromptu halt as PSG players surrounded him and hugged the former England captain by one before he walked off.

Addressing PSG fans after collecting a winners medal, Beckham said: 'I want to say thank you to everybody in Paris - to my team-mates, to the staff, to the fans.

'It's been very special to finish my career here. It could not have been any more special.

'I just feel that it's the right time [to retire]. I feel that I've achieved everything that I could in my career. I wanted to go out as a champion. I've finished my career in a team that has treated me like I've been here for 10 years.

'After 22 years of playing football I'm going to take a few months to enjoy time with my family.' 

Beckham had looked emotional before the game, waving to the crowds and blowing kisses to his fans during the warm up for his final match.

As his name was read out over the stadium's speaker system, PSG fans gave out a huge cheer and continued to chant 'Stay David, Stay' throughout the match.

Despite playing just 460 minutes of 
football for PSG, the massively wealthy club wanted to honour Beckham 
for the publicity he has brought them around the world - making him 
captain for one night only.

Before kick off, Beckham and his teammates wore t-shirts in tribute to the club's nutritionist Nick Broad who died in a car crash earlier this year.

In his final outing, the midfielder enjoyed a fine game, spraying some of his trademark 50-yard passes around the pitch before assisting a goal from a corner as PSG went 3-0 up before half time.

The team, who have already been crowned champions of Ligue 1, won the game 3-1.

After the game Beckham was tossed in the air by his teammates in the centre of the pitch as the retirement celebrations began.

'We are proud to have him as our captain, even if it is for only one game,' said season ticket holder Jacques Declerc.

'Yes, it is unusual for somebody to 
be honoured in this way after only being at the club for a few months, 
but that's the nature of modern football.'

It was initially thought Beckham 
would bow out in an away game next week, but he made it clear he wanted 
to finish his career in Paris.

Wearing a leather biker jacket and 
leopard print heels, Victoria was pictured hopping into a waiting limousine with the rest 
of the family earlier this evening.

They were then driven to the Bristol 
Hotel, where Beckham has been staying in a £17,000 a night suite 
since joining PSG in February, before heading off for the ground.

Beckham has paid tribute to his 
former teams, his nationality, and his children by wearing a 
personalised pair of Adidas Predator boots.

Beckham, capped 115 times for England
 and the man who helped London secure the 2012 Olympics, chose the 
colours red, white and blue to represent the Union Jack, with the flag 
embossed on the heel.

As well as his children's names, the 
boots are also emblazoned with the significant numbers from his playing 
career with Manchester United, Real Madrid and LA Galaxy: 7, 23 and 32.

Announcing his retirement on 
Thursday, Beckham said: 'I'm thankful to PSG for giving me the 
opportunity to continue but I feel now is the right time to finish my 
career, playing at the highest level.

'If you had told me as a young boy I 
would have played for and won trophies with my boyhood club Manchester 
United, proudly captained and played for my country over one hundred 
times and lined up for some of the biggest clubs in the world, I would 
have told you it was a fantasy. I'm fortunate to have realised those 
dreams.'

Despite such words, there have been some in France who have expressed anger as his short career with PSG.

'A funny photo, a red card and a tax 
scam' was the Nouvel Observateur headline, referring to a picture of 
Beckham falling over, to his sending off while playing for PSG against 
Evian, and to allegations that he went out of his way to avoid paying 
tax in Paris.

PSG is ultimately owned by Qatar, the
 oil rich Gulf state, and some feel that Beckham's move to France was 
ultimately aimed at cementing business contacts with their 
representatives.

He did not score a single goal in Paris, and was mainly used as a substitute.
