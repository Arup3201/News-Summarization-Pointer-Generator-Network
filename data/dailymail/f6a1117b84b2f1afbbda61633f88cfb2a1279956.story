A 56-year-old 'Teacher of the Year' lured one of his 14-year-old students with a fake Facebook profile before raping her in his car, it has been claimed.

Joaquim Andrade, who teaches English at Brockton High School in Massachusetts, allegedly engaged the teenager in conversation about soccer via the popular social networking site.

He then reportedly drove to her home, picked her up and traveled to another location, where he sexually assaulted her. The attack took place on October 7 off school grounds, it is alleged.

Andrade was arraigned on Friday and charged with the rape of a child with force, the enticement of a child, indecent assault and battery on a child over 14, Plymouth County District Attorney's Office said.

The father-of-four, who has been voted the school's 'Teacher of the Year' twice in the past seven years, is being held on $20,000 bail and denies the charges, Brockton Enterprise News reported.

Andrade, who began teaching at the school in 1993, allegedly contacted the student on Facebook after teaching her in his ninth-grade 'English as a Second Language' class.

Following the alleged assault, he reportedly  dropped her off at a soccer game with his phone number, alongside a false name to put in her phone.

The girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, reported the allegations to school officials on October 10, prompting a three-week-long investigation by Brockton police.

During the inquiry, Andrade was placed on administrative leave. On Friday, School Superintendent Kathleen Smith said the situation has not changed despite his charges.

The teacher, who hails from Cape Verde in West Africa, has rights, 'both in regard to the court system and in regard to his employment status,' Ms Smith said. 

But she added: 'Rest assured, however, that the Brockton Public Schools will deal with this situation as aggressively as it can,' should his status change.'

Andrade's arrest has shocked parents at the school, who were notified of the investigation as soon as the charges against the 23-year teacher, soccer coach and mentor emerged. 

Rich Cogliano, whose child attends the institution, told WCVB: 'It's something you'd never expect in a school environment. You pray it would never happen.'

Wendy Murphy, a nationally recognized expert on sex crimes and child abuse, added that sometimes a teacher who seems too good to be true 'is' too good to be true.

Investigation: If Andrade posts bail, he will be required to surrender his passport, keep away from the alleged victim and avoid unsupervised contact with children under  17. Above Andrade's Brockton home

The city's elected leaders are offering support to the teenager.

School administrators have also been working with the victim and her family, Ms Smith said.

If Andrade posts bail, he will be required to surrender his passport, keep away from the alleged victim and avoid unsupervised contact with children under the age of 17.
