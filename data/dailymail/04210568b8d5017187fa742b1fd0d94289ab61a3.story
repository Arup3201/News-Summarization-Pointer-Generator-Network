Embattled football star Manti Te'o was not among the dozens of college football prospects who are on their way to professional careers in the sport.

It is believed that the notorious fake girlfriend scandal earlier this year presented too much of a distraction around Te'o, a former college standout, and NFL suitors decided to pass on him.

It is another setback from a star estimated to be among the top 24 in this year's crop of prospects, and missing out in the first round may cost him lucrative sponsorship deals.

Picked: The Minnesota Vikings selected Manti Te'o in the first round with the 29th pick overall

Also not helping Te'o was less-than stellar performance during the BCS championship game against Alabama, which raised many concerns about how he would handle himself in the NFL.

He also came up short during the NFL scouting combine in February, where he ran a 4.82-second 40-yard dash, a slow time for a linebacker.

Unpicked: Te'o, a former Notre Dame linebacker, was not present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay at his home in Hawaii

The former Notre Dame linebacker was not
present at Radio City Music Hall for the draft, opting instead to stay 
at his home in Hawaii.

The teams believed to have taken the most interest in Te'o - the Chicago Bears (20th pick) and the Minnesota Vikings (23rd pick) - decided to go with and tackle Kyle Long and cornerback Shariff Floyd, respectively.

The Vikings had another shot at a first-rounder with the 25th pick, but went with Florida State University cornerback Xavier Rhodes instead.

Minnesota was given yet another chance to select Te'o after trading with the New England Patriots to obtain the 29th pick, but shocked Te'o supporters when they selected wide receiver Cordarrelle Patterson from the University of Tennessee.

Te'o will now have to wait until Friday, when the second and third rounds of the draft will begin.

Even before the draft started, football fans could not resist taking digs at Te'o on social networking sites like Twitter and Facebook.

One user tweeted a picture of an empty chair with the caption: 'Waiting with manti teo's gf waiting to see what team will draft him.'

Another posted: 'Manti Te'o has a better chance of getting a call from his fake girlfriend rather than an NFL team.'

Te'o's tragic story about his girlfriend, Lennay Kekua, tugged on America's heartstrings last September as Notre Dame began their push into the BCS championships.

Kekua supposedly died around September 12 from leukemia after recovering from a near fatal car crash - just six hours after his grandmother passed away.

Among those that paid tribute to Kekua was CBS, which showed a picture of her on This Morning with a direct quote she has supposedly said to Te'o: 'Babe, if anything happens to me, you promise that you'll stay there and you'll play and you'll honor me through the way you play.'

Top picks: Eric Fisher, pictured left, and Luke Joeckel, pictured right with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, were the No. 1 and 2 picks overall

Humor: Several Twitter users could not resist a joke at Manti Te'o's expense

Fake: The Twitter account of Lennay Kekua was made using photos of Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed she had never met nor spoken to Te'o

But it wasn't until a groundbreaking article on Deadspin.com that Lennay was exposed as an elaborate hoax.

The scheme was found to be orchestrated by Roanaiah Tuiasosopo, who admitted that he used phony Twitter and Facebook accounts to get Te'o's attention, win his affection and carry on an exclusive online relationship.

In those fake accounts was a picture of a woman, later identified as Diane O'Meara, a high school classmate of Tuiasosopo who claimed that she had never met or spoken to Te'o.

Te'o claimed that he was a victim, and was not in on the scandal.

In an interview with Katie Couric in late January, Te'o said that he briefly lied about his online girlfriend, after discovering she didn't exist.

But he maintained that he had no part in creating the hoax.

Deceived: Earlier this week Te'o emotionally 
denied he was involved in any sort of cover-up while instead admitting 
he believed Lennay Kekua, played by Tuiasosopo, was real

Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te'o said he believed that 'Lennay' had died of cancer.

'You stuck to the script. And you knew that something was amiss, Manti,' the talk show host said.

He replied: 'Katie, put yourself in my situation. I, my whole world told me that she died on September 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on September 12.'

Couric also asked Te'o point blank: 'Are you gay?'

Cracking a smile, he responded: 'No. Far from it. Far from it.'

The Te'o episode boosted Couric's ratings by 30 per cent.

Self-indulging: Tuiasosopo said that he fell 
'deeply, romantically in love' with Te'o though he was playing him for a
fool while pretending to be a woman

In an interview with Dr Phil McGraw, Tuiasosopo admitted that he was gay and fell 'deeply, romantically in love' with the Notre Dame linebacker even though he was deceiving him.

Tuiasosopo also confirmed that it was him impersonating 'Lennay,' despite the fact that voicemail recordings sound high-pitched and feminine.

Since the Couric interview, Te'o has mostly stayed out of the limelight, but appeared at the NFL scouting combine in February and was pictured during various workouts.
