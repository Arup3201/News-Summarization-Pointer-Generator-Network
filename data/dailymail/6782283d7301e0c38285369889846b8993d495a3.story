A couple in Washington DC are facing up to a potential wedding day disaster on Saturday because the intended venue for their nuptials was affected by the government shutdown.

When Mike Cassesso, 29, and MaiLien Le, 30, decided to marry they wanted to celebrate their union at the site of their first date - the west lawn of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial.

With their 130 guests already starting to fly in from all over the country for Saturday’s ceremony, they received an ominous e-mail from the National Mall and Memorial Parks permit management office warning them on Monday that their intended venue was in doubt pending last night’s decision on Capitol Hill.

As things stand, unless the government shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on Saturday then Cassesso and Le plus their family and friends will be barred from stepping foot on the lawn which had until now held so many precious memories for them.

‘Shutdowns are one of those things 
that on an intellectual level you know are going to impact an average 
person, but you really don’t get it until it hits you in a way like 
this,’ Cassesso told the Washington Post. 

‘There
 are plenty of people around the country who may not understand that 
this isn’t just going to hurt nameless government workers and that, in a
 depressing way, it impacts your wedding plans with just a few days’ 
notice.’

The couple are so nostalgic about their first date by the Jefferson Memorial three years ago that, in the run-up to their wedding, they had a professional photographer take pictures of them paddleboating by the memorial again.

Washington couple Mike Cassesso and MaiLien Le have admitted they briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site - the Thomas Jefferson Memorial which has been closed as part of the government shutdown

'This is a very meaningful site to me,' Cassesso.

A couple of weeks ago, when they began pondering how a shutdown might impact their nuptials, Cassesso and Le never thought that the wedding site would be off-limits.

‘We just thought there’d be leaves on the ground, that there’d be no maintenance, no rangers or Park Police,’ Cassesso said.

They couple even briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site, but their thoughts quickly turned to finding an alternative venue.

Unfortunately finding a venue for 130 guests isn’t an easy task at short notice and the couple quickly determined that they had two options – to either marry at their reception venue, the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar on Capitol Hill; or use the backyard of their apartment building.

Although Cassesso was keen to go with their backyard because they’d already spent $700 to rent chairs, his bride put her foot down because the yard is also home to a dumpster.

‘I don’t want there to be a dumpster. It’ll smell,’ said Le.

The couple are one of two dozen October weddings on the Mall endangered by the federal shutdown.

Nationwide more than 400 parks are impacted by the shutdown, but a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said it doesn’t have a tally for the number of weddings scheduled.
