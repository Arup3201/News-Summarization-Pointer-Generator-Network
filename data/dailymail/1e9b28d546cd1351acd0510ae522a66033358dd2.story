Brave: Even with all the bones in her face broken, Kesley Little was worried about her mother

A courageous teenager told her mother she knew she was going to die and not to be sad after suffering horrific injuries when she was hit by a pick-up truck.

Kelsey Little broke every bone in her face and was left with part of her skull exposed when the oncoming vehicle smashed into her as she walked along an unpaved section of road with two friends in Minooka, Illinois.

The 13-year-old, who was returning home after buying ice cream, turned to her mother as she arrived at hospital and said: 'Mom, I love you. I love you. I know I’m going to die, but don’t be sad.'

Mum Nancy Deckelman this week recalled the terrifying ordeal, and told the Joliet Herald-News: 'Here she is, worrying about me -- worried I would be sad. That’s Kelsey Little. As her friends say, "Little But Strong."'

Kelsey
 was taken to Provena Saint Joseph Medical Center in Joliet but was 
airlifted to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago just hours later 
when a brain scan revealed severe head trauma.

The
 talented schoolgirl, whose right side was black and blue from the 
impact, remained in intensive for five days, with doctors fearing 
permanent neck and spinal damage.

Nancy told the newspaper: 'I wouldn’t wish having to see your child that way on any parent.'

Kelsey,
 a straight A student, returned to Channahon Junior High School full 
time in the spring but her health problems have continued.

She
 has suffered two hematomas -- swelling in the location of the skull 
fracture -- and it was not until June, eight months after collision, that
 doctors noted the fracture was starting to heal.

Kelsey, now 14, still gets regular headaches and short term memory loss, and Nancy said the pain is often unbearable.

She
 added: 'That brings a lot of frustration and a little bit of anger on 
her part. I’ve become more protective of her. I don’t let her out of my 
sight. I’ve become overprotective of her - so has the rest of the 
family.

'She may seem like a different person on the outside, but on the inside, she’s still the same loving and sweet girl. She is a miracle. She is still alive, and I’ll take that.'

The community rallied to raise money for the hefty medical bills -- with friends distributing 'Little But Strong' bracelets and Channahon police officers, who include Kelsey's stepfather Steve Deckleman, holding a fundraiser.

Kelsey arrived home to find more than 100 friends, family and strangers waiting on her front lawn, and Nancy said: 'We are truly blessed to live in a community that cares so much for one another. It was essential in helping all of us with the healing process.'

The driver of the pick-up truck -- a teenager from Channahon -- was charged with failure to reduce speed and no valid drivers licence. His mother was charged with allowing an unauthorized person to drive.
