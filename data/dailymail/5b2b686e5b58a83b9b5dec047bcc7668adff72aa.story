Jean-Eric Vergne has announced he will not be driving for Toro Rosso next season, ending months of speculation over his future in Formula One.

The Frenchman missed out on a high-profile promotion to parent team Red Bull, with his rookie team-mate Daniil Kvyat selected to take over from departing four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel.

Vergne, 24, was still amongst the contenders to drive for Toro Rosso in 2015 - although one seat was taken when the marque announced 17-year-old Max Verstappen would be welcomed into the fold.

Total grand prix races: 58

That left Vergne, with three years' previous racing experience with the team, vying for the one remaining spot against the likes of Carlos Sainz Jr, Pierre Gasly and Alex Lynn - with the former running in the post-season Abu Dhabi test.

But he tweeted on Wednesday afternoon that his future lies elsewhere: 'Despite a good season & 22 pts, I'll not drive anymore for Toro Rosso in 2015. Thanks for those years. Let's go for another big challenge,' he wrote.

On the surface there appears to be very little room left on the grid for Vergne, with McLaren and Caterham the only teams yet to finalise their driver line-ups and the latter still unsure as to their own future in F1.

A veteran of 58 grands prix, Vergne could take a test role or attempt to find a competitive drive in a different formula.

Toro Rosso are likely to name Spaniard Sainz Jr. as their new driver in the coming days, the 20-year-old linking up with fellow newcomer Verstappen.
