Luxury 4x4s that were to appear in the hotly-anticipated upcoming James Bond film Spectre have been stolen from a garage in Germany.

Nine Range Rover Sports, worth an estimated £630,000, had been specially modified for the 24th 007 film and were awaiting transport to the Alps for filming.

It is believed the theft could delay production. The Bond films are famous for the spy's cars being fitted out with state-of-the-art gadgets and weaponry, so new luxury vehicles may have to be extensively altered.

A Land Rover UK spokesperson told the Daily Express: 'We are aware of the theft of a number of Range Rovers in Dusseldorf, Germany.

'This is a criminal act and the police are carrying out a full investigation. That is the only comment I can offer.'

The title of the new film, directed by Brit movie maker Sam Mendes, revolves around the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism and Revenge and Extortion.

Spectre is led by iconic evil genius Ernst Blofeld, the super-villain from the Dr No and Thunderball movies.

The film, which is due for general release on 6 November 2015, will feature Oscar-winning star Christoph Waltz, Moriarty actor Andrew Scott, Italian star Monica Bellucci and French actress Lea Seydoux alongside Craig.

It has taken its title from the shadowy terrorist organisation created by Bond author Ian Fleming which first appeared in his novel Thunderball.

Locations for the new film will include London, Mexico City, Rome, Morocco's Tangier and Erfoud, as well as Solden in Austria, which promises to see Bond returning to the ski slopes.

'All of them are amazing places. I'm very excited to be going to these locations over seven months, which is how long we'll be shooting,' said Mendes.

Announcing the production, film-makers said of the plot: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation.

'While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre.'
