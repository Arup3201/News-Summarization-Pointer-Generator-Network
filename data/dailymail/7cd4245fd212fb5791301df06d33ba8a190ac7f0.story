Gael Bigirimana has revealed he knew he was ill BEFORE he signed for Rangers in the transfer window.

The 21-year-old midfielder was part of the Newcastle Five who moved to Glasgow on loan at the end of the transfer window – but has not kicked a ball for the Ibrox club.

Rangers are believed to be paying a total of £5,000-per-week for the loan deals of Kevin Mbabu, Shane Ferguson, Remie Street and Haris Vuckic.

But along with Bigirimana, Mbabu and Ferguson have not been fit enough to play, while Street has played less than 45minutes.

New Rangers manager Stuart McCall has revealed Bigirimana will not be fit enough to play before his loan deal is up and Burundi born midfielder has said he knew he was ill before he moved.

Suggestions on social medial that Bigirimana was suffering from Hepatitis C, but he has denied that.

Speaking to The Daily Record. Bigirimana said: ‘I didn’t know I wouldn’t be able to play. I didn’t think it would be a problem that would stop me playing. Nobody told me.

‘Yes, I knew I had a problem but I didn’t think it would stop me playing here because that problem didn’t stop me playing in England. But obviously different FA’s have different rules.

‘It’s obviously disappointing but my disappointment cannot change what has happened and what is happening. But I do hope Rangers get back where they belong.’

Vuckic is the only one of the five players who has made any kind of impact at Ibrox and with Rangers paying £1,000-per-week for each of the five players it means they have currently shelled out £40,000 with the final bill expected to be £65,000.
