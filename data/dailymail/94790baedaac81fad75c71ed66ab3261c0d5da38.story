Keegan Brown will head straight back to his day job as a lab assistant on Monday morning having beaten three-time world champion John Part in the opening match of the World Darts Championship.

The 22-year-old world youth champion from the Isle of Wight raced into a two-set lead, winning the opening seven legs, before watching his Canadian opponent come storming back to level the score at 2-2.

But Brown held his nerve in the final set to clinch a 3-2 victory over Part at Alexandra Palace and set up a potential second-round meeting with two-time world champion Adrian Lewis on Sunday, December 28.

After his victory on Thursday night, Brown said: ‘I’ve got to juggle work and practicing now.

‘I will be going back to work on Monday morning as a lab assistant and be working on Christmas Day and Boxing Day as planned - then I’ll be back here a week on Sunday.

‘If someone told me that I was going to play against a former world champion in the first match on the opening night of the World Championships I would have ripped their two arms and two legs off. This is what dreams are made of.’
