They are renowned for being among the most beautiful women in the world.

And the renowned Victoria's Secret models certainly live up to their reputation in a new set of images by photographer Nick Knight taken for the cover of 10 Magazine.

Nick shot stars such as Lily Aldridge, Lily Donaldson, Barbara Fialho and Candice Swanepoel for 12 special covers which are being described as a calender - because there is one for each month.

Lily Donaldson wore red lipstick in her shoot and closed her eyes 

The pictures, which show the models posing in beautiful VS underwear, are for next month's issue of the magazine and readers will be able to pick the cover of their choice. 

Sophia Neophitou, a stylist who works closely with Victoria's Secret helped Nick to come up with the concepts for the shoot. 

She told the Daily Telegraph: 'As a woman, what I want to project is a sense of empowerment. At no point do I want her to feel like the victim of predictability of a man's vision of a woman.'

However, it has not come without controversy. Nick has previously been criticised for his love of using Photoshop on images, giving models an even more unattainable look.

This is something which he has fought back on saying: 'I don't see why taking a pimple off somebody's nose, or changing their eye colour or elongating their body or anything else, is wrong.' 

Nick has been working as a photographer for more than 30 years and has snapped some of the most famous people in the world.

He's worked with Kate Moss, Lady Gaga and Boy George and he owns the online fashion broadcasting company SHOWStudio.
