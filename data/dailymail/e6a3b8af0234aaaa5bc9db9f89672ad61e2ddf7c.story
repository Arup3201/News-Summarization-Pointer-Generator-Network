An elderly widow has been evicted from her home of 46 years because her son could not afford to pay the mortgage.

Pensioner Mary Heywood, 84, from Southampton, was forced to pack her belongings and leave her house after her son, Philip, could not afford the mortgage repayments on the home.

Once the pensioner was ushered by bailiffs into a waiting taxi, locksmiths moved in and changed the locks on the £190,000 terraced house as building society Nationwide took possession of it.

Nationwide have said they offered numerous times to come to an arrangement with the family living at the property when they began struggling with mortgage repayments.

Mrs Heywood and her son Philip, 54, got behind on payments when Mr Heywood got into financial difficulties.

Mrs Heywood bought the house with her late husband Ernest in 1969.

Their only son Philip, a self employed computer programmer, took charge of the mortgage payments from his elderly father in 2004.

But he cut back his working hours when his father was hospitalised and eventually died in 2011, aged 84.

Mr Heywood said he struggled to cope with the loss of his father, and work began to dry up as the debts rose to tens of thousands of pounds.

He said the eviction was the climax of a legacy of huge debts racked up following the death of his father.

He said: 'It's my fault that it's got to this point, I've handled things badly and perhaps I've made some bad decisions.

'I just wish that I could turn back time. I've lived here almost all my life so it's part of my life.'

Building society Nationwide said it took action after serving its fourth and final eviction notice and making continued attempts to forge a deal.

Nationwide reclaimed the house after Mr Heywood failed to find the money, a new job or alternative employment.

A spokeswoman for Nationwide said the organisation had shown 'significant forbearance' over a long period of time.

They said: 'This is a case where we have gone above and beyond what would be expected of a reasonable lender and have made numerous attempts to help Mr Heywood find a solution which works for him and for the society.

'We do, though, owe it to our wider membership to ensure that we do not sustain losses from such situations as, over time, this will affect the viability and sustainability of their building society.'

It is unclear where Mr Heywood and his mother are staying.

A spokesman for Southampton City Council urged the elderly woman to get in touch with them.

She said: 'We will do our best to help a resident in such a situation and urgently encourage them to contact our homelessness unit as soon as possible for an assessment.'
