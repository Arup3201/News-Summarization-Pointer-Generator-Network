The ‘miracle pine’ that survived the 2011 tsunami in Japan will be immortalised as a monument to the victims of the disaster as the nation marks the second anniversary today.

The 88ft pine was the only surviving tree in a forest of 70,000 which was wiped out when the tsunami hit Rikuzentakata, Iwate prefecture.

The disaster on March 11, 2011, left 
nearly 19,000 people dead or missing and more than 300,000 without a 
home, and many have yet to return.

In memoriam: The 'miracle pine' pictured today after it has been  artificially restored as a monument marking the anniversary of the 2011 tsunami in  Rikuzentakata, Iwate Prefecture

The pine tree, which also survived major
 tsunami in 1896 and 1933, died six months ago as a result of the 
environmental changes in the area.

The ‘miracle pine’ was felled soon afterwards and giant moulds were made in order to re-create the tree and raise the monument on the spot where it stood for 173 years.

As Japan marked the second anniversary of the devastating earthquake and tsunami, it emerged that thousands of families remain displaced.

There is growing dissatisfaction in the island nation as the population accuse the government of not putting enough effort into the recovery process.

About half of those displaced are 
evacuees from areas near the nuclear Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, 
whose reactors melted down after its cooling systems were disabled by 
the tsunami.

I'm a survivor: The tree was the only to still stand in a forest where an estimated 70,000 stood before the tsunami moved on the small city and nearly wiped it off the map

Building memories: After the tree died it was cut up and partly re-created in order to create the monument

Pining for the past: As Japan marks the second anniversary of the disaster, the tree is one of the few things which has been fully restored in the aftermath of the tsunami

All by myself: What used to be a forest is now a beach with a lone tree, a large part of which is 'fake' as the real deal died six months ago as a result of the increased levels of saline in the ground

Made of stronger stuff: The tree was 173 years old before it died, 18 months after the disaster - which was the third tsunami it had survived

Today 800 of them filed a lawsuit demanding compensation from the government and the now-defunct plant's operator, Tokyo Electric Power Co. (TEPCO), for their suffering and losses.

‘Two years after the disasters, neither the government nor TEPCO has clearly acknowledged their responsibility, nor have they provided sufficient support to cover the damages,’ said Izutaro Managi, a lawyer representing the plaintiffs.

Japan’s new Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the government intends to make ‘visible’ reconstruction progress and accelerate resettlement of those left homeless by streamlining legal and administrative procedures many blame for the delays.

‘I pray that the peaceful lives of those affected can resume as soon as possible,’ Emperor Akihito said at a somber memorial service at Tokyo's National Theater earlier today.

At observances in Tokyo and in still barren towns along the northeastern coast, those gathered bowed their heads in a moment of silence marking the moment, at 2:46 p.m. on March 11, 2011, when the magnitude 9.0 earthquake - the strongest recorded in Japan's history - struck off the coast.

Throughout the disaster zone, the tens of thousands of survivors living in temporary housing are impatient to get resettled, a process that could take up to a decade, officials say.

‘What I really want is to once again have a "my home," ‘ said Migaku Suzuki, a 69-year-old farm worker in Rikuzentakata, who lost his son and the house he had just finished building in the disaster.

Further south, in Fukushima prefecture, some 160,000 evacuees are uncertain if they will ever be able to return to homes around the nuclear power plant, where the meltdowns in three reactors spewed radiation into the surrounding soil and water.

Evacuees are anxious to return home but worried about the potential, still uncertain risks from exposure to the radiation from the disaster, the worst since Chernobyl in 1986.

While there have been no clear cases of cancer linked to radiation from the plant, the upheaval in people's lives, uncertainty about the future and long-term health concerns, especially for children, have taken an immense psychological toll on thousands of residents.

Still in pain: As the country marks two years since the tsunami, many in Japan are complaining that the restoration work is too slow and many have yet to return to their homes

‘I don't trust the government on anything related to health anymore,’ said Masaaki Watanabe, 42, who fled the nearby town of Minami-Soma and doesn't plan to return.

A change of government late last year has raised hopes that authorities might move more quickly with the cleanup and reconstruction.

Since taking office in late December, Abe has made a point of frequently visiting the disaster zone, promising faster action and plans to raise the long-term reconstruction budget to 25 trillion yen (£175 billion) from 19 trillion yen (£134 billion).

‘We cannot turn away from the harsh reality of the affected areas. The Great East Japan Earthquake still is an ongoing event,’ Abe said at the memorial gathering in Tokyo.

‘Many of those hit by the disaster are still facing uncertainty over their futures.’
