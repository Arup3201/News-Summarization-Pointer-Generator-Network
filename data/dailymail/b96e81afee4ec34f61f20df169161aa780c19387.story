If Paul McKenzie shouts ‘alarm’, his dog Millie is trained to press a panic button.

But when he slipped into a diabetic coma, he was far beyond shouting – and seemingly beyond help.

Millie, however, had other ideas. When she found Mr McKenzie, 47, slumped on the floor, the clever black labrador took matters into her own paws – and pressed the button all by herself.

Paw talent: Millie raised the alarm by pushing a panic button when Paul McKenzie slipped into a diabetic coma

Initiative: Millie managed to press Paul's panic button even though he was unconscious and unable to give her the command

It alerted staff at a 24-hour control centre who tried to contact Mr McKenzie, before dialling 999 and calling his neighbours for help.

Mr McKenzie, who also has neuropathy – nerve damage, a common complication of diabetes – was taken from his home in Derrington to Stafford hospital and put on a drip to restore his blood sugar levels.

The former IT consultant said: ‘Millie is my very own Lassie – she saved my life, and if it wasn’t for her, I wouldn’t be here now.’

‘She is a lifeline for me anyway - she is
specially trained to help me do household tasks, as I have trouble 
getting about and lifting and carrying things on my own.

‘I can’t 
believe how clever she is. We have trained her to press my emergency 
button on command, and I often use it to call for help if I’ve fallen at
home and can’t get up.

‘Never in my wildest dreams did I think that 
Millie understood the consequences of her pressing the button - that 
help always arrives.

‘The emergency services were amazed when they realised it was my dog who had called for help.

‘She’s
one in a million - my best friend.’

Millie was trained by canine 
assistance charity Canine Partners, who provide assistance dogs to 
people with disabilities to help them with day to day life.

Mr 
McKenzie, who gave up work five years ago when his nerve damage 
worsened, relies on Millie to pick up things from the ground, which is 
difficult for him, and often causes him to fall.

As part of her 
training, the four-year-old was taught to press the emergency button if 
Paul gets into difficulties, and has done so around ten times in the 
last two-and-a-half years.

The button contacts staff at Stafford and 
Rural Homes, a charity which owns and manages 5,600 homes in the borough
that were formerly council housing stock.

Mr McKenzie, who is 
divorced, said of the incident last month: ‘I’d been out in the morning 
with Millie doing some shopping and all was well but my bloods had been 
low.

‘I ate lunch but was then sick and so felt a tad rough in the 
afternoon and at around 6:30 Millie and I had a game of tugging a rope, 
which was my last memory for a while.

‘The Lifeline button was 
pressed at 7:45pm. The team were shouting for me through the speaker - 
usually we can shout to each other using this no matter where I might be
in the flat - but when they heard no response from me they realised 
Millie must have pressed the alarm and summoned help.’

A spokesperson 
for Canine Partners said: ‘We train all our dogs in emergency 
procedures, whether it is fetching help or activating a Lifeline button.

‘Usually
the dogs do this on command, but in Millie’s case she knew Paul was in 
trouble and worked out that by pressing the button help would be 
summoned.

‘We are very proud of Millie.’
