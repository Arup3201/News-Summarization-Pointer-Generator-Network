One way to avoid the dangerous rays of the sun is to stay indoors, another is to apply a healthy layer of sun cream and slap on a wide-brimmed hat.

If you’re in China, however, there is a third option - a 'Face-Kini' complete with a body suit.

The name describes a protective head mask that is being used in Shandong province's East China Sea coast by beach-goers who want to protect their skin from the sun.

Stay away from the sun: Chinese beachgoers wearing body suits and protective head masks

Added benefit: The face masks were designed to protect from sunburn but they also repel insects and jellyfish

The clothing was invented around seven years ago and is now under mass production and on sale at swimwear stores along the coast.

They are selling factory-made Face-Kinis for 15 to 25 yuan (£1 to to £2.50) each.

They are also extremely effective at repelling insects and jellyfish.

His and hers: The suits come in wide range of colours and patterns

Some fashion-conscious swimmers match the colour of their protective head mask to their body suit

One for me, one for you: Small sized protective head masks are also made for children

Eureka! The clothing was invented by a local around seven years ago and is now under mass production and is on sale at swimwear stores along the coast

Fashion: The outfits are the latest trend on the beach front resort
