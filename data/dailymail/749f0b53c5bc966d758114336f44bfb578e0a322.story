Olivier Giroud certainly isn't the most technically-gifted Frenchman to have played for Arsenal.

There are numerous contenders for that accolade: Thierry Henry, Robert Pires and Patrick Vieira would all be worthy recipients of that honour.

Giroud doesn't possess the Gallic flair of his fellow countrymen. No-one can dispute that.

However, his importance to this period of the Arsene Wenger era is just as important than those of his predecessors.

He notched his 11th of the season against Crystal Palace - his 50th in total for the Gunners - on Saturday afternoon. Considering he missed three months of the season with an ankle injury, that's an impressive return.

But the goals only tell part of his contribution.

Giroud is a throwback. Your archetypal English No. 9 - the sort of forward Arsenal haven't seen since, perhaps, Alan Smith.

You're unlikely to see Giroud beat four men on the way to scoring a worldy. 

While he might not be especially technically gifted, Giroud thrives on the physical side of the game

What you will see, though, is Giroud putting his head where it hurts. Two minutes into the second half at Selhurst Park, there he was blocking a Wilfried Zaha cross by the right-hand touchline.

In the 74th minute, he sprinted more than half the length of the pitch to prevent Joel Ward from supplying a cross.

He does that nasty side of the job - not because he has to, but because he wants to. Supporters love him for it.

Giroud enjoys the battle. He gets off on it. 

Questions marks were raised over Giroud's place in Wenger's plans following the summer capture of Danny Welbeck.

The England international made clear he wanted to occupy Arsenal's central striker role.

You can only wonder what Giroud was thinking. Injured; knowing his place in the side was under threat.

What happens on his first match back from injury? He scores. He's not looked back. 

On Saturday, Welbeck played but started on the right; Giroud taking centre stage. The Frenchman looks to have won his personal duel with the former Manchester United striker.

Indeed, he was left fighting for his Gunners future last summer after falling out of favour with Wenger for his highly-publicised flouting of club rules after bringing a woman back to the team hotel the night before a match.

Ask those behind the scenes at Arsenal's London Colney HQ and they'll explain once you've lost Wenger's backing it's virtually impossible to get it back.

Giroud is the exception to that rule. And that's testament to his temperament and determination.

The Frenchman clung onto his Arsenal career and refused to let go.

He may not have the 'je nais sais quoi' of his countrymen before him - but, for now, he's Wenger go to guy.

Following their 2-1 win at Selhurst Park, Arsenal are third in the Premier League table with 48 points
