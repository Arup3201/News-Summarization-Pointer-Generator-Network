A Saturday morning JetBlue flight from New York to Las Vegas was diverted to Detroit after a belligerent passenger lunged at a flight attendant in front of his horrified family.

The unidentified male is shown in a passenger video shouting at the crew member as his children plead with him to stop and another person can be seen trying to hold him down.

He was yelling in a foreign language and did not speak English, a passenger told WABC, so no one had any idea what he was upset about.

Out of control: This man shouted at a flight attendant before lunging at him as his children begged him to stop

The 6.40 a.m. flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport was in the air for about an hour when the disruption occurred, according to a passenger who gave the footage to the network.

He appeared to be in a heated argument with his family before others aboard the sleepy plane became involved.

The man only became more irate, and was banging on seats while gesturing at a flight crew member trying to calm him down.

But the effort had the opposite effect, and the man lunged at the flight attendant as his children shouted in horror.

‘Dad, dad, stop it,’ they begged.

Cuffed and taken away: The man was then moved to the back of the plane before being taken to a Detroit-area hospital by police

Their father was instead handcuffed by the flight crew and led away. The irate passenger attempted to wriggle free as he was pushed down the aisle by three attendants the back of the plane.

The captain then made the snap decision to offload the man in Detroit, where he was taken to a local hospital for evaluation.

‘Due to a customer issue, the captain elected to divert to Detroit this morning in an abundance of caution,’ the airline said in a statement.

There were no further incidents, and the flight resumed after a few hours.

The passenger remains in police custody. It is not clear what charges he may face.

Also not clear is whether drugs or alcohol played a role.
