There were six smiling faces before horror and tragedy struck. Now there were six little coffins, six stolen lives.

One by one, the bodies of five young brothers and their ten-year-old sister were laid to rest yesterday exactly six weeks after an arson attack at their home.

Scores of neighbours, friends and relatives stood in silence as a cortege of horse-drawn carriages made its solemn procession through streets cleared of traffic along the route to the children's funeral.

Emotional: Pallbearers had tears in their eyes as they carried the children's coffins out of the church while family and friends sobbed and hugged each other

But two faces were missing. The 
youngsters' parents Mick and Mairead Philpott – in jail awaiting trial 
for their murder – were refused leave to attend amid fears they would 
provoke what was described as a 'lynch mob' atmosphere at which their 
safety could not be guaranteed.

The couple had been branded 'scum' by
 members of the public during two court appearances, and Father Alan 
Burbidge, who was helping to organise the funeral – paid for by members 
of the public – had warned the ceremony would be 'very difficult' if the
 parents attended.

And so, in a service attended by 
mourners wearing brightly coloured clothes and carrying single yellow 
roses, six white coffins bearing each child's name were buried in their 
absence. Instead, other family members led a packed congregation in 
prayer at St Mary's Roman Catholic church in Derby before a private 
burial nearby.

Each coffin was decorated with a motif relating to the brief life of the children, aged between five and 13.

Final journey: The children were taken to Nottingham Road Cemetery, Chaddesden, to be buried in a private service for the family 

There was a fairytale princess for 
ten-year-old Jade, whose casket was borne in a carriage pulled by white 
horses in pink livery.

For Duwayne, 13, it was the emblem of
 Derby County football club; toy soldiers for John, nine; a Peppa Pig 
character on a Nintendo screen for Jack, eight; a wrestling logo for 
Jesse, six; and a dinosaur cartoon character for Jayden, five.

Individual school photos of them in 
their blue uniforms adorned the order of service for a two-hour requiem 
mass. Classmates in the same uniform filed into the pews, some weeping. 
Their head teacher was among those who spoke about their short but happy
 lives.

Tragic end: Five of the six children died in the blaze at the semi-detached house in Allenton, Derby, in the early hours of May 11. Duwayne died two days later in Birmingham Children's Hospital

Through the streets: The carriage holding Jade's coffin led the cortege as it passed through the Derby streets following the emotional funeral

Pink fan: White horses with plumes of pink feathers and pink flags pulled the pink carriage containing Jade's coffin

No expense spared: The children also had their names spelled out in floral tributes that rested on top of each of the carriages

Solemn: The coffins of Jade, 10, Jayden, five and Jessie, six, are carried into St Mary's Catholic Church in Derby town centre ahead of the funeral service

Procession: Two white horses sporting pink plumes of feathers had pulled
 the carriage containing Jade's coffin while five others containing the 
bodies of her brothers followed on behind

Heartbreaking: Featuring a picture of a pink princess, Jade's coffin was carried at the front of the procession into St Mary's

Celebration amid sadness: The white coffins containing the body of John, nine, (left) and his younger brother Jack, eight, (right) follow on behind. John's coffin was printed with toy soldiers

But the children's story was most 
poignantly told by profiles and tributes understood to have been 
compiled for the order of service by their siblings from what was once a
 family of 17. Together they painted a dramatically different picture 
from the tragedy that befell them.

Duwayne was described as a 'charming 
and caring young boy' on the threshold of becoming a young man – a 
football fan and music lover who was learning to play the violin. As the
 oldest of the six he became a 'protector' for his younger brothers and 
sister.

Jade was 'a beautiful princess with a
 permanent smile on her face... always full of energy'. She was part of 
the chaplaincy team at school and had a talent for boosting class 
morale.

A celebration of their lives: The order of service featured a picture of all six children on the front and emotional tributes to each of them inside

'Protector': Eldest child Duwayne, 13, was described as a 'charming and caring young boy' and a 'real ladies man' in the order of service

'Mother hen': Only girl Jade, 13, became a 'mother hen to her younger brothers' always carrying them around on her hip

'Cheeky chappy': John, nine, had a 'daredevil personality' but his teachers described him as 'cheerful, smiley and polite'

'Quiet': Jack, eight, was 'cute, cuddly and content with everything' and was the quietest of his siblings who loved to watch Peppa Pig

'Mischievous': Jesse, six, was 'crazy, clumsy and cheerful' and a little boy who will be remembered for his loving nature

'Baby': Nicknamed the 'miracle baby' because he was early, Jayden, five, was 'bouncy and hyper-active' and had a penchant for crisps

Upset: Mourners were urged to wear bright colours but they could not contain their grief as they walked into the church for the children's funeral service

Brave: Relatives weep as they follow the children's coffins into the church. A death notice placed in the announcements section of a local newspaper paid tribute to the children. It read: 'They all touched the hearts of so many'

Gathering: Huge crowds assembled outside the church across a footbridge, their colourful brollies shielding from the rain that had just started to fall

Assembling: Members of the public gather outside St Mary's church as the Philpott children's coffins are carried in

Too young for such grief: Many of the mourners were children, who cried as they watched the coffins being carried into and out of St Mary's

Haunting: The tragic six Philpott children posed for a photograph together without their siblings before their death. From clockwise, Duwayne, John, Jayden, Jade, Jesse and Jack

Charged: The children's parents Mick and wife Mairead Philpott, seen here weeping at a press conference in May following the devastating fire at their home have been charged with their murder and were not at the funeral

Shell: The fire swept through the children's home in Allenton, Derby as they slept in their beds. Mr and Mrs Philpott are set to go on trial for murder in January 2013

John was described as 'a cheeky 
chappie, always lively and ready to pick a fight with all the boys' but 
'cheerful, smiley and polite', while Jack was 'a real pretty boy with 
bright blue eyes... cute, cuddly and content with everything'.

Jesse 'would come in from the garden 
head to toe mucky' and was 'very mischievous', and Jayden, the 'baby of 
the family' was 'mothered by Jade' and could eat seven packets of crisps
 in one go.

The six died on May 11 when the 
council semi in Victory Road, Allenton, was set ablaze with petrol at 
the front door.

They were asleep upstairs and were killed by inhaling 
smoke.

A neighbour who witnessed firemen and paramedics battling to 
rescue and revive them described a tragic aftermath of 'little bodies in
 pyjamas on the pavement'.

Earlier this month the couple were 
abused and called 'scum' when they appeared for the first time in court.

Yesterday some of the same people who attended that hearing threw 
flowers and shed tears in the rain as pall bearers carried the coffins 
one behind the other into church.

Earlier, police closed roads and 
marshalled traffic along a normally busy ring road to allow the 
horse-drawn carriages' procession.

The funeral was paid for by donations
 of more than £11,000 from the local community after residents set up a 
drive to raise money.

In May, the Osmaston Community Association of Residents (Oscar) began collecting money after appealing in the local press.

At the time, the children's parents 
were not regarded as suspects and Oscar was named as the family's 
officially approved organisation.

Sponsored walks, money collections and
 fundraising events were organised in the weeks after the tragedy.

Philpott, 55, and his 31-year-old 
wife, who has the children's names tattooed on one arm, had pleaded to 
be allowed to attend the funeral on compassionate grounds.

Prison 
service officials carried out a 'risk assessment' in conjunction with 
police but refused permission.

Yesterday – somewhere miles away – they remained in separate jails for the children's final farewell.
