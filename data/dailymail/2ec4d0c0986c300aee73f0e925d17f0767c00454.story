After 50 years as the lead singer of the Rolling Stones, Mick Jagger has regaled the world with some of the ­lessons he has learned from a lifetime of rock 'n' roll. On an American TV chat show last week, he revealed his ten pearls of wisdom.

Not surprisingly, these included his views on that unholy trinity of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.

Now in his 70th year, he self-deprecatingly quipped: 'You start out playing rock and roll so you can have sex and do drugs. But you end up doing drugs so you can play rock and roll and have sex.'

It was a good joke. But, with the career he's had, he must surely have picked up more than a mere ten ideas as to how life should be lived. Here are a few he appears to have overlooked.

DON'T WRITE LOVE LETTERSOr, if you must, always put in something so secret, so deeply embarrassing about the recipient that she can never sell it for fear of making the information public. If he had heeded this, Jagger would have avoided the ignominy of his former lover Marsha Hunt, the mother of his daughter, Karis, auctioning his letters to her for £175,000.

LIKE ROYALTY, NEVER CONFIRM OR DENY ANY RUMOURSThis is one lesson Jagger learned long ago. That means the public still does not know for sure if he was indeed caught in flagrante at Kensington Palace with Princess Margaret.

BE YOUR OWN BOSS Though one of the biggest acts in the world, the Rolling Stones still don't own the rights to their biggest hit records from the Sixties, such as Satisfaction and Little Red Rooster, due to ­contracts signed early on.

KEEP A DIARY Decades ago Jagger agreed to write his autobiography and took a very large advance from a publisher, only to have to return it when he realised he couldn't remember anything of what he had got up to in the Sixties and Seventies. He must have lost millions in potential book sales.

START MOISTURISING AT AN EARLY AGELike a middle-aged woman, Jagger was faced with the choice between keeping his face plump and sacrificing the figure, or maintaining those slim hips and sacrificing the face. He went with the gamine shape. Enough said.

FORGET SOLO ALBUMS Whenever
 he has brought out a solo album it has bombed. Primitive Cool, released
 in 1987, was described as 'garbage'. The Rolling Stones is the brand — 
almost as famous as Coca-Cola. He's just their poster boy.

NEVER SHARE A GIRLFRIEND WITH MATESGirls talk, as he found out a year ago to his embarrassment. Keith Richards's autobiography contained a very unflattering revelation from Jagger's former girlfriend Marianne Faithfull about his the size of manhood ­ ­ ­— disclosed while she and Keith were in bed together.

... AND EXPECT TROUBLE IF YOU DO Richards might not have been so spiteful if his mate hadn't been romancing Keith's girlfriend Anita Pallenberg at the same time as him.

TAKE CARE NOT TO PLAGIARISEIn
 1997, Mick and Keith had to share royalties with singer-songwriter 
k.d.lang for accidentally borrowing from her hit 'Constant Craving'. 
Neither Stone can explain how the lifted tune ended up on the Stones' 
single, 'Anybody Seen My Baby?', but it was definitely there.

HELL'S ANGELS DON'T MAKE GOOD SECURITYThe
 Stones hired Hell's Angels to police a concert at Altamont in 
­California in 1969, only for the bikers to beat and stab a fan to 
death.

KEEP THEM GUESSINGAndrogyny doubles a star's appeal, which doubles the number of potential fans of either sex — which, in turn, ­doubles the profits.

NEVER GIVE UP ON THE CRICKETAn English rock star will be ­forgiven almost anything if he's spotted in a floppy hat at Lord's on a summer's day.

DON'T BE MODEST 'The
 greatest rock and roll band in the world', it says on the billboards. 
By saying it loud and often enough, Jagger has convinced the world they 
still are

WEAR A CODPIECE It's worked a treat on stage for many years — indeed, John Lennon used to take huge pleasure in pointing it out.

NEVER MIX WOMEN AND WORKLook
 at the aggravation The Beatles got themselves into when Yoko began 
turning up at recording sessions and sitting on an amp. A rock 'n' roll 
man's got to do what a rock 'n' roll man's got to do.

KEEP THE WORLD GUESSING                                                                                                      Jagger remains a chameleon and a mystery. And mystery sells out 
stadiums.

RUN YOUR BUSINESS WITH A ROD OF IRON                                                                                  Mick
 is famously tough with his crew on Rolling Stones tours. The word is 
that any of the crew caught taking drugs while working is sacked!

VANITY WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERECarly
 Simon was right, when she sang the lines 'You're so vain: you probably 
think this song is about you.' Regardless of whether she was singing 
about Jagger or the actor Warren Beatty, vanity never held either back.

MOVE ON QUICKLY Luckily,
 everyone's already ­forgotten about Super Heavy, the supergroup he 
formed a ­couple of years ago with soul singer Joss Stone and Eurythmics
 front man Dave Stewart.

KNOW YOUR WORTH When
 the band began they were just five guys on stage, with no fireworks and
 no massive stage effects. But, the greater the effects, the more they 
can charge for seats, and therefore the bigger the profits.

TAKE A RISK Before
 Jagger, world famous rock stars didn't have degrees, and as an 
undergraduate he wondered if it was worth the risk of dropping out. It 
was. He left the LSE two years into his degree — albeit with the option 
of going back to finish his studies if the Stones didn't make it.

BE RUTHLESS                                                                                                                                        For the good of the group, Brian Jones had to be pushed out of the Stones when his drugs habit spiralled out of control.

CHARM THE GREAT AND THE GOODIt's all very well having great mates, but it never hurts to have friends in high places. In 1967, Jagger was jailed for a minor drug offence. Then, after an editorial in The Times saying the sentence was draconian, he was swiftly released and helicoptered to a TV meeting with the editor of The Times, a former Home Secretary and a Bishop.

NEVER BE DULL In a letter to singer Marsha Hunt, Jagger described John Lennon and Yoko Ono as being 'boring' when they went on their peace campaign in 1970. He could never be accused of that.

SELL OUT IF YOUR MUST                                                                                                              Keith Richards accused Jagger of being too willing to be influenced by the Establishment. But that was just Keith, clinging to his buccaneer image. Having Tony Blair as a fan got Jagger a knighthood.

NEVER CALL CHARLIE WATTS 'MY DRUMMER'Watts clouted him in the face on the one occasion he did and, in return, described Jagger as 'my singer.'
