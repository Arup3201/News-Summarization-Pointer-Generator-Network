Marouane Fellaini says that he was always confident he could help Belgium win against Algeria from the bench if called upon - and he did just that as he came on to score in their 2-1 comeback victory.

Strikes from Fellaini and fellow substitute Dries Mertens turned the match around after Sofiane Feghouli had scored Algeria's first World Cup goal in 28 years from the penalty spot to put the Africans into a shock 24th-minute lead.

And Fellaini has revealed he knew he would be able to contribute positively if coach Marc Wilmots turned to him.

He told FIFA.com: 'I always believe and I thought that, yes, if the coach gives me the call, I can help us win this match.

'One thing I know is that if my team-mates put crosses in the box for me, I can score goals. And you saw it today.

'Three times the ball came in for me and every time I won the header - I could have had a hat-trick.

'I'm just glad that one went in though because we were beginning to run out of time, and it was important we took one of our chances.

'In the end, I think we got what we deserved. We started very nervously and played badly in the first half.

'But I think you saw the character of this team in the second half. We just needed to stay calm, make the right decisions, and doing that got us this fantastic result.

Substitute: Fellaini (centre) came off the bench to make the difference for his national side

Bench: Belgium coach Marc Wilmots' two substitutes, Fellaini and Dries Mertens, scored against Algeria

'I'm really happy, both for myself and for the team.

'Scoring at a World Cup was a great moment for me and I immediately thought about my family, who always supported me through the years no matter what.

'Everything they did for me led to that moment.'

The 26-year-old midfielder tweeted a photo after the match with his team-mates, accompanied with the caption: 'Well done for the first game. Thanks for your support. You are really amazing. Now focus for the second one.'

Belgium captain Vincent Kompany tweeted a selfie on the flight after the match with the words: 'Night time flight! Going back to home base! #SaoPaulo #Cheer4Belgium.'

And Fellaini was also quick to lavish praise on his fellow Belgian squad members, saying that any of the 23-man squad could have been called upon and made the difference.

It was Fellaini and Mertens on this occasion, but the 6ft 4in midfielder believes it could be someone else who changes the match next time around.

He said: 'Everyone can see that it was guys who came off the bench who made the difference today.

'That's always possible with this team anyway because you know that we have a lot of strength throughout the squad. It's not just about the first 11 with us.

Big money: Fellaini (left) signed for Manchester from Everton for £27.5million last summer

'And although it was me and the other two today, there are others who stayed on the bench who can be big and important players for Belgium at this World Cup.'

Fellaini endured a difficult season at Manchester United following a £27.5million move from Everton, but before the tournament Wilmots predicted that 'the World Cup will be a good opportunity for him to take his revenge'.

After being reminded of Wilmots' anecdote, a smiling Fellaini responded: 'I hope he's right.

'I've definitely been looking forward to this tournament. It's my first World Cup and it's amazing to be part of it all.

'Every player in the world wants to be here, so I appreciate this opportunity very much. I just want to make the most of it now.'
