It might not be time to pack away that barbeque just yet, after a miserable stint of torrential rain Britain is set to enjoy  a week of warm, sunny weather with temperatures hitting over 22C.

With many areas of the country seeing as much as an inch of rain falling in an hour, people can now look forward to a more settled spell and a drier couple of days.

Although some weather warnings remain in place, forecasters say most of the rain has already fallen and that today will be the start of a gradual change for the better.

Charles Powell, a forecaster at the Met Office, said: 'It sets the scene for a much more settled spell over the weekend.'

While there will be showers in the North and it will remain breezy, the south will enjoy long sunny spells.

SUNDAY:

NORTH: Quite windy with some rain

(Max: 17C Min: 9C)

SOUTH: Dry with sunshine

(Max: 20C Min: (12C)

MONDAY:

NORTH: Windy with rain at times

(Max: 18C Min: 10C)

SOUTH: Max: 20C Min: 13C

TUESDAY:

NORTH: Breezy with some showers

(Max: 15C,  Min: 8C)

SOUTH: Cloudy with a little rain in places

(Max: 19C,  Min: 12C)

A cold spell is expected towards the end of next week but then the high pressure should build up once again bringing the sunshine back later in the month.

Claire Austin, a meteorologist at MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said: 'There's been quite a nasty band of rain moving across the country.

'As we go through the afternoon it is an improved picture.'

The yellow warnings of rain from the Met Office - advising people to 'be aware' - are in place for much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

A large area of England has also been issued with the same warning, with the North West, North East and Yorkshire escaping it.

The yellow warning is in place until 8am today.The Met Office said the public should be aware of the risk of localised flooding, with outbreaks of heavy, thundery rain expected to spread from the South overnight.

The Environment Agency has issued five flood alerts for the South West and one flood alert for the North East.

A spokeswoman for the Environment Agency said: 'Widespread heavy rain is expected to spread from the south west of England today and into tomorrow.

'This has the potential to cause localised significant flooding across Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, although other areas may also be at risk.

'Environment Agency staff will continue to closely monitor the situation and teams are out working to minimise river flood risk, clearing debris from streams and unblocking culverts.

'Local authorities will respond to any reports of surface water flooding. We would urge people to keep up to date by visiting the Environment Agency website and signing up to our free flood warning service.'
