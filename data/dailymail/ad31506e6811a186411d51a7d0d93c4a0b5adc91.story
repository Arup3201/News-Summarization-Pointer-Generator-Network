Sarah Palin thinks Chelsea Clinton's pregnancy could cause Hillary Clinton to change her mind about abortion.

Palin told Extra host Mario Lopez that, 'Just knowing that her daughter Chelsea is pregnant with a baby — it’s a
 real baby — it’s not some disposable something,' will perhaps make Hillary reconsider her stance on the issue.

The former vice presidential nominee noted that her comment 'will be
 controversial, but those who, perhaps, they’re in this position now as a parent or a 
grandparent, they realize sanctity of life, how innocent, how precious 
it is.'

Sarah Palin thinks that Hillary Clinton will 'kind of broaden her world view' when she becomes a grandparent, and potentially 'open her eyes' on the issue of abortion

Palin made the remarks during an interview with Extra's Mario Lopez, after Lopez asked her if Chelsea Clinton's pregnancy would make Hillary Clinton 'more electable'

Lopez was in Palin's hometown, Wasilla, Alaska, to interview her about her new Sportsman Channel show Amazing America with Sarah Palin for a segment airing on the channel today.

In a teaser of the interview released on Tuesday, Lopez asks Palin if she thinks that Chelsea's pregnancy will make Hillary 'more electable,' as some pundits have suggested.

Palin said she that when Hillary becomes a grandparent it will 'broader her world view' on issues such as the national debt and abortion.

'So maybe even on a social issue like 
that, she'll open her eyes,' Palin said.

Chelsea Clinton announced that she and her husband Marc Medvinsky were having their first child at a Clinton Foundation event last month. She was on stage with her mother, former First Lady Hillary Clinton, promoting global empowerment for women at the time.

'I certainly feel all the better whether it’s a 
girl or a boy that she or he will grow up in world filled with so many 
strong female leaders,' Chelsea said of her pregnancy.

After the event, Hillary Clinton tweeted, 'My most exciting title yet: Grandmother-To-Be!'

Not long after, political pundits began speculating whether or not Chelsea's baby bump would give presumed 2015 presidential candidate Hillary a bump in the polls.

Palin is a mother and a grandmother herself. The former Alaska governor and her husband Todd have five kids - Bristol, Track, Trig, Piper and Willow- and two grand kids - Bristol's son Tripp and Track's daughter Kayla.

Asked by Lopez about her own 2016 presidential plans, Palin laughed the question off.

'Oh my goodness, it would be some time down the road because a lot can 
happen, especially in the world of politics in the matter of days, 
weeks, months, much less two years.'
