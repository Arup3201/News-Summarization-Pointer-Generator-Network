She dropped an impressive five dress sizes last year and Vicky Pattison hasn't been shy about showcasing the results since.

However, the reality TV star, who we are more accustomed to seeing falling out of clubs in tiny bodycon dresses, is debuting a sophisticated new style.

Vicky, 27, has given FEMAIL a first look at her new fashion range for Honeyz - and promises that it will make every girl feel 'amazing'.

Vicky Pattison, who found fame on Geordie Shore, has unveiled her new range for Honeyz - and shows off her sophisticated style and recent weightloss in the campaign images 

Speaking about creating the range, the Geordie Shore star revealed the great lengths she went to to ensure it was prefect.

She said: 'The range is a real labour of love. We've been developing it tirelessly and we're finally at a place where we are designing almost all of the items ourselves, sourcing the material and making really affordable and fashionable items for women that I'm so proud of.' 

The 27-year-old has been working 'tirelessly' on her new range and says there's something for every body shape and the entire range will make every woman feel 'amazing'

Vicky cites Victoria Beckham as her icon and says she would love to see 'gorgeous girls' Michelle Keegan and Sam Faeirs wearing her collection 

Vicky, who says she's always been interested in fashion and looking good, wanted to design this range for normal women of all shapes, sizes and ages. Dresses are priced at around £30 and and jumpsuits at around £40.

The clothes, she says, are for real women: some with curves, some slim - and she models each look to perfection.

The fashion fanatic says she is constantly inspired by the women around her; including one woman in particular.

'I'm inspired by women like Victoria Beckham whose style is so classic, timeless and feminine it transcends time,' she said. 'Her new collection is beautiful. I also love Balmain and Michael Costello.' 

The successful star will host of her very own show, Judge Geordie, which is slated to air later this summer

Vicky, who says she would love to see 'gorgeous girls' Sam Faiers and Michelle Keegan wearing her clothes, is the first to admit that her style has had a complete overhaul since finding fame. 

'I've been through quite a big style evolution over the last couple years,' she said. 'But more than that being down to me losing weight, I feel as though it's my age. As I'm getting older, I'm becoming more sophisticated and classic.

'However, since losing my weight I have enjoyed being more adventurous.'

While she rocks sophisticated camel coats and chic vibrant blazers from her new range, the Newcastle local assures us that she'll never forget her roots.

'Am I over bodycon dresses? Gosh no!,' she laughed.

'I still love letting my hair down and wearing party dresses and jumpsuits. I will never forget my roots and I'm still a party girl at heart; my range still reflects that.

'No Geordie girl's collection would be complete without a couple party dresses.' 

Vicky recently dropped a staggering five dress sizes after overhauling her lifestyle and she's keen to show off the results of her hard work whilst modelling her new range

As well as making a foray into fashion (and a soon-to-launch jewellery range), Vicky is set to re-launch her TV career with a brand new role that will see her become Britain's answer to Judge Judy. 

It has been confirmed by MTV and Lime Pictures that the 27-year-old will host of her very own show, Judge Geordie, which is slated to air later this summer. 

The on-screen star certainly has ambition. She added: 'I'd love to be a TV presenter doing the X Factor or something.

'But in terms of my collection, I would love to see it grow and expand. No one would have thought Victoria Beckham would end up rubbing shoulders with Anna Wintour and sitting on the front row of fashions shows, but she is.

'She has carved out such a fantastic career for herself within the fashion industry and she's genuinely well respected and admired. If I could experience even a fraction of her success, I would be over the moon!'.
