Matt Prior is close to walking again after discovering a potential career-ending injury just this month.

The wicketkeeper, who has seen his spot in the England side passed on to Jos Buttler, underwent an operation to rectify an achilles problem that became altogether more serious. 

Prior's surgeon found a worrying three-inch tear through the middle of his tendon. 

Matt Prior tweeted a scar of his Achilles injury that was worse than the surgeon first feared

The 32-year-old played through the pain all summer without knowing the full extent of the injury 

The 32-year-old revealed last week to thinking his cricket career was over after the operation took on complications. 

He cut a more upbeat figure on Tuesday morning however, tweeting the wound that he says is 'coming on nicely'. 

'Seen the doc change of dressing and coming on nicely! Another day closer to walking again! #longwaytogo,' Prior wrote. 

Prior's form with the gloves dropped significantly after last summer's Ashes win, with a poor tour to Australia and then in the series at home against Sri Lanka. 

That was in part due to the tear - something the Sussex man battled through, unaware of the actual damage he'd done.
