Best-selling tipple Baileys is scrapping its distinctive bottle shape after almost 40 years...so that drinkers can keep it in the fridge door.

The Irish cream liqueur has been sold in the instantly recognisable container that is shorter and fatter than a typical bottle of spirits since its 1974 launch.

But although it can last for up to two years at the back of the drinks cupboard - even after being opened - a growing number of its predominantly female fans like it chilled.

Now drinks giant Diageo, which owns Baileys along with other brands like Guinness, has finally decided to change the shape to fit modern demands.

From this month it will be sold in a slimmer, longer, wine-shaped bottle in its first major revamp since the original launch.

A £1 million publicity campaign to introduce the new look will accompany the launch as fans of the whiskey (corr) based tipple, often a Christmas favourite, get to grips with it.

Diageo says the new shape gives it a ‘stylish and elegant’ profile but admits: 'It allows it to fit inside a fridge door.'

The company added the shape would appeal more to the drink’s huge female fanbase.

A spokesman said: 'As one of the most-loved female spirits brands in the world, we need to not only to appeal to current Baileys consumers and adorers, but ensure we also appeal to each new generation of progressive, savvy and spirited women.

'We have created a beautiful new bottle which is both modern and stylish, with a greater sense of femininity.

'Baileys is a brand that appeals specifically and uniquely to women, and through this re-design we embrace and celebrate that timeless appeal in a fresh and contemporary way.'

The drink does not have to be kept in the fridge, it can last for up to two years with or without being chilled and whether or not it has already been opened.

But after years of being associated with a largely middle aged, Christmas market, the brand tried to make itself younger and trendier with expensive ad campaigns encouraging drinkers to try it with ice in.

Now a lot of its younger buyers keep a bottle in the fridge rather than the drinks cupboard.
