A British woman out hiking alone has fallen to her death in the French Alps, it emerged today.

The body of the 52-year-old, who has not yet been named, was found by other walkers close to a mountain refuge near Le Desert, in the Valjouffrey Valley, 26 miles from Grenoble.

She is thought to have fallen around 330ft (100m) after losing her footing on a steep path leading up to the Col de Vaurze, at around 2500m.

It was at around 8am today that the other walkers came across the woman’s body, but there had been no emergency call beforehand.

‘This makes it clear that she was out walking alone,’ said a spokesman for the local mountain police, who said she would be identified when next of kin had been informed.

The tragedy comes after four climbers were killed in separate accidents in the Alps yesterday.

Two Italian women, aged 37 and 41, were killed by an avalanche as their climbing party tried to reach the top of Mont Blanc du Tacul in the Mont Blanc range early in the morning.

Later in the day two French climbers were found dead in a 20 metre-deep crevasse on the Roche de la Muzelle, at 3465m.

The amateur climbers had left a refuge on Monday morning and fell into the crevasse on their way down the mountain the mountain.

Numerous Britons are among the thousands who arrive in the French Alps during the summer to enjoy a range of mountain sports, including climbing and hiking.

Many are, however, unprepared for treacherous conditions which include snow and ice at high peaks, and hugely dangerous paths.  Around 20,000 people try to reach the summit of Mont Blanc, the highest peak in western Europe, every year.Many lack the most basic equipment, and are unprepared for sudden changes in the weather.
