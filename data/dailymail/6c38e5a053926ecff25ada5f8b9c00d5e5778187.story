The widow of murdered headteacher Philip Lawrence has today sent a personal message of support to the bereft family of Ann Maguire.

Frances Lawrence, whose husband was stabbed through the heart at the gates of his west London school in 1995, has sent her 'love and prayers' to the distraught loved-ones of the Spanish teacher.

But she admitted 'there are no words' to help them on the 'cruel journey' they have started since Mrs Maguire was stabbed to death on Monday by her 15-year-old student in front of 30 classmates.

Mr Lawrence, 48, was hit over the head with an iron bar, kicked and then 
stabbed, outside St George's Roman Catholic School in 
Maida Vale, north-west London.

Support: Frances Lawrence, with a portrait of her murdered husband behind her, has sent a personal message to the family of Ann Maguire giving them her love and prayers for the cruel journey they are on

Similarities: The deaths of Philip Lawrence, and now Ann Maguire, both sparked mass mourning outside the schools where they died

He had seen one of his students being attacked by a gang but was brutally murdered when he intervened.

'Eighteen years ago, my husband Philip Lawrence, a headteacher, was murdered outside his school as he intervened to save a pupil from gang violence,' she wrote.

'By now perhaps I should have learned words of comfort for you, the family and community of beloved teacher, Ann Maguire.

'But I have learned only that there are no words. Instead I send all my love and my prayers and my ongoing thoughts along the cruel journey which you are now forced to begin.'

Previous case: In 1995, headmaster Philip Lawrence (left) was stabbed 
when he intervened in a fight outside his school, St George’s in Maida 
Vale, London, and later died. His killer was Learco Chindamo 
(right)

Like Ann Maguire, Philip Lawrence was killed in front of his schoolchildren.

- Message from Frances Lawrence to family of Ann Maguire

The
 fatal blow was struck by 15-year-old Learco Chindamo, who had denied 
the crime but was convicted and jailed for a minimum of 12 years in 
1996.

He was the leader of a 
Triad-inspired gang of mainly Filipino students who wanted to ‘punish’ a
 13-year-old student after he quarrelled with one of them.

Mr Lawrence saw the boy being hit with a metal bar, but was murdered when he intervened.

It later emerged Chindamo had bragged to a friend in an amusement arcade that he had ‘killed a teacher’.

‘I’ve turned around as he’s tapped me on the shoulder and I’ve stabbed him in the chest,’ he said.  Just 12 days before he stabbed Mr Lawrence, he had attacked a passer-by with a beer bottle.

The parents of Luke Walmsley, who was
 murdered with a knife at school in rural Lincolnshire in 2003, have said a 
culture of violence persisted around the country after the murder of Ann Maguire.

Tragedy: Luke Walmsley, 14, who was stabbed 
through the heart in front of a crowd of horrified pupils. His parents 
Jayne and Paul have called for greater security in school after the 
death of Ann Maguire

Stabbed: Ann Maguire, 61, was pronounced dead at a hospital after attempts to save her life failed

Jayne
 Walmsley, whose son was 14 when he was stabbed during a break in 
lessons, described the figures as ‘really shocking’. She added: ‘We need
 to think and educate these kids. It’s got to stop.’

‘But
 sometimes it feels a little bit like you are banging your head on a 
brick wall. Especially when schools now won’t admit to the problem 
because all they want is more pupils for more money.’
