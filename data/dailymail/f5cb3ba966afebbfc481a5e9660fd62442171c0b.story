Almost eight months after Google launched its Chromecast device in the U.S, the streaming stick is finally on sale in Europe the UK.

The £30 gadget, which resembles a USB drive, is plugged directly into the HDMI port on modern TVs and streams content from the web, via an owner's phone, tablet, or laptop.

It is an easy way for people without smart TVs or web-enabled set-top boxes to access the web on the big screen in their living room.

The £30 gadget, which resembles a USB 
stick, is plugged directly into the HDMI port on modern TVs and streams 
content from the web, via peoples phones, tablets and laptops.

All this content is controlled via 
apps, and the European version of the stick currently features content 
from the BBC, YouTube and Netflix.

Chromecast is a direct competitor to the Apple TV system that was launched by the Cupertino company in 2007, and is now in its third generation. It also rivals the streaming box services of Roku.

By comparison, Roku boxes start at £60 ($99), while the Apple 
TV device sells for £99 in the UK and $99 in the U.S.

Chromecast is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as Chrome and Apple's iOS operating system.

apps, and the European version of the stick currently features content

Today’s announcement means Chromecast is available in the U.S, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland.

Analysts claim Google
 wants to have a presence on TVs because it opens up a lucrative 
new channel for advertising.

Mario Queiroz, Chromecast's vice president of product management said: 'Chromecast will keep getting better.

'In a few weeks more than 3,000 developers worldwide have signed up to bring their apps and websites to Chromecast.

'You'll soon have more TV shows, movies, videos, sports, music and video games to choose from.'

The device originally launched in the U.S. in 2013 and cost $35.

The software and device has now been updated to include streaming services in countries across Europe.

Chromecast is a direct competitor to the Apple TV system which launched in 2007, and is now in its third generation. It also rivals the streaming box services of Roku and Sky's Now TV box.

By comparison, Roku boxes start at £60 ($99), while the Apple 
TV device sells for £99 in the UK and $99 in America. The Now TV box is the cheapest, at £9.99.

Chromecast also lets users multitask, 
meaning they can send emails, tweet, or browse the web on their phone, 
while streaming content to the TV.

Although
 Chromecast makes it possible to stream content from the web, individual
 apps will charge for individual shows, TVs and other content. This is the same on rival devices.

The BBC iPlayer and YouTube content is free, but Netflix content requires a £5.99 monthly subscription, while the Now TV entertainment packs start at £4.99 a month.

Chromecast is compatible with Android smartphones and tablets, as well as Chrome, and Apple's iOS operating system. 

Google also announced Chromecast has been opened up to developers, meaning other apps will soon be able to incorporate Chromecast support into their apps, and stream their content to TVs. YouTube streaming is pictured

Chromecast is the latest product from
 the company intended to make inroads into the living room, after previous 
offerings didn't work out well.

The company initially tried to embed an operating system, called Google TV, into sets made by TV manufacturers, but that flopped.

In 2012, Google introduced an orb-like device called the Nexus Q in hopes 
of delivering more internet video to TVs, before pulling the product from the market.

In

 a move that has allowed Google to keep costs of the Chromecast down, 
the video processing is done on the synced phone, tablet or laptop. The 
stick merely 
provides an easy interface to display this content on the big
 screen.

The Apple, Roku and Now TV
 streaming boxes, by contrast, are standalone gadgets connected directly
 to the internet which rely on a remote controls to select 
content.

The Chromecast is competitively priced against similar devices including the Roku box, pictured left, which starts at £60 ($99), and the Apple TV device, pictured right, which sells for £99 in the UK, and $99 in the U.S

Another rival is Sky's Now TV box, pictured, which is the cheapest of the lot at £9.99, plus subscription packages

Forrester Research analyst Sarah Rotman Epps said Chromecast could undermine Apple in the market to plug streaming devices into TVs, just as the Nexus tablets have siphoned some sales away from Apple's iPad.

'Chromecast looks like a smart and disruptive device,' said Ms Rotman Epps. 'Maybe it took the other failures for Google to get it right.'

Last year, Apple revealed it sold more than 13 million of its streaming boxes. Roku said its sales of streaming boxes passed 5 million units in 2013.

Chromecast is available from Google Play, Amazon and Currys & PC World.
