The Indiana man who was arrested for threatening to 'go on a rampage' at a local school and was found to have 47 guns in his home entered a not guilty plea in court today.

The wife of Von Meyer, 60, called police after he said he would stab her with a screwdriver, kill her children and grandchildren, and launch a shooting spree at the school where she works as part of the cafeteria staff.

Meyer's threats on Friday came just hours before a 20-year-old man opened fire at Sandy Hook Elementary School halfway across the country in Connecticut.

Arrested: Von Meyer, 60, was arrested after threatening to kill people at a nearby elementary school

Meyer's wife, who has not been 
publicly named, got in an altercation with her husband on Friday morning
when he threatened to gouge her eyes out, stab her with the 
construction tool, and light her on fire when she was sleeping.

He also threatened his wife's 
children and grand children before turning his attention to the children
of Jane Ball Elementary School.

The couple's home is less than 500 
feet from the school, and Meyer was undoubtedly familiar with the 
facility because his wife works there.

The police report states that the 
school is easily accessed from Meyer's home by a series of trails and 
paths that cut through a wooded area.

Officials at Jane Ball School were notified, and they immediately took unspecified security measures.

The same happened at all local schools on
Friday because of the threat, which was undoubtedly heightened as news 
rolled in of the shooting in Connecticut.

Wooded area: Meyer lives in a home that is less than 1,000 feet away from an elementary school

Dangerously close: Meyer's house is extremely close to an elementary school, making his comments more threatening

He claimed that he was going to 'kill
as many people as he could before police could stop him', and once they
showed up at the couple's Ceder Lake home, it was clear that he would 
have been able to carry through with that threat.

When police arrived at Meyer's home, 
they found 47 guns- many of which would have fit in a historical 
collection- and ammunition, the sum of which cost more than $100,000.

'Through investigation, police 
learned that Meyer reportedly had a large number of weapons hidden 
throughout the two story historical home,' the report states.

Police arrested Meyer and he now 
faces four counts of felony intimidation, two counts of resisting law 
enforcement, and one count of domestic battery.

Bond has been set at $100,000 and he is going to be represented by a public defender.

That said, police chief Jerry Smill 
told the Associated Press that he believes that the threat against the 
school was not serious.

Meyer's wife said in the probable 
cause affidavit that it was not the first time that her husband had 
threatened her, and that they had a 'turbulent' relationship.

Meyer was known to be a member of the Invaders Motorcycle Gang, though his role in the group was unclear.

Like
the notorious Hells Angels, the Invaders Motorcycle Gang is also 
considered an outlaw group. The Northern Indiana chapter was founded in 
1965.
