Jimmy Kimmel narrowly lost out to his older, entrenched, competition of Jay Leno but did manage to edge out David Letterman during the trio's first battle Tuesday at the prestigious 11:35 p.m. time slot.

The results show that Kimmel's ABC program, 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' pulled in about 3.1 million viewers across the country, just 177,000 less than Leno's 'The Tonight Show' on NBC.

Letterman's 'Late Show' on CBS was seen by 2.88 million people.

The figures should give hope to ABC execs who decided to switch Kimmel, 45, from his midnight time slot to 11:30 p.m. in order to try and take down Leno, 62, and Letterman, 65.

ABC took its news program, 'Nightline' from 11:35 p.m. and instead put it on after Kimmel's show.

Kimmel's show Tuesday had actress Jennifer Aniston and musical group, No Doubt.

Aniston came out with a sledgehammer and smashed Kimmel's new desk and later give Kimmel a haircut.

The ratings come as Kimmel was reportedly trash-talking his rival by calling Leno, who has long dominated the late night game, a 'sell out.'

'As a comedian, you can’t not have disdain for what he’s done: He totally sold out' he told Rolling Stone magazine.

But he didn't have a negative thing to say about Letterman.

'If I beat David Letterman in the ratings, does that mean I’m better than Letterman. No f—ing way,' he added.

Despite the early good news for Kimmel, he may not want to celebrate too much.

Conan O'Brien also had a strong debut when he temporarily took over for Leno at 11:35 p.m in 2009, the Wall Street Journal noted.

But O'Brien's numbers quickly plummeted and NBC was forced to bring Leno back.

O'Brien is now on cable network TBS at 11 p.m.
