Commuters streaming into New York City today endured lengthy waits, crowded platforms and trains crammed full with disgruntled passengers - a week after Superstorm Sandy ravaged the country.

The Monday morning rush hour gave the recovering transit system its first stress test, revealing massive problems that still persist a week after public transport ground to a halt across the city.

Carriages were so crowded on the Long Island Rail Road that scores of people missed their trains, while queues for the ferry in Jersey City stretched to several hundred people by daybreak.

Nearly all subway lines are now running and service has been restored on key lines connecting Manhattan and Brooklyn - yet officials warned travellers they could still experience problems.

Hectic: People wait at a crowded subway stop as the city tries to recover from the effects of Hurricane Sandy in Brooklyn, New York. Some of the city's transit system is still not operating

Waiting: Most of the subway lines are running, but trains are less frequent and slower

Other water-logged subway tunnels are still not ready for rush hour and 
that trains will be less frequent and slower than normal, officials said.

The subway system, which carries 5.5 
million riders daily, still suffers from damage to underwater tunnels, 
submerged tracks near the coastline and wrecked stations and equipment, they added.

'Service will not be normal tomorrow, 
and we need you to understand that before you enter the system,' Gov. 
Andrew Cuomo warned on Sunday.

Workers called their employers 
from crowded platforms to ask to work from home, while 
others tried to figure out complicated routes to their offices.

'There's not much we can do,' said Louis Holmes as he waited to 
board a ferry in Jersey City to his job as a security guard at 
Manhattan's September 11 memorial site.

'We'll get there whatever time we can, and our jobs have to understand. It's better late than absent.'

Manic: People wait in a line to enter a crowded subway stop in Brooklyn during the Monday morning commute

Desperate: A man looks at the line to enter the crowded subway stop on Monday morning

Patience: Last week, commuters had been forced to take cars or buses, sparking gridlock across Manhattan

Squeeze: Disgruntled commuters cram into subway trains as the public transit system attempts to recover

On Long Island, Janice Gholson told AP she could not get off her train from Ronkonkoma and Wyandanch because ofthe overcrowded carriage, and ended up travelling past her stop.

'I've never taken the train before,' she said. 'There were people blocking the doorway so I got stuck on the train.'

Mayor Michael Bloomberg took the subway 
to work on Monday and was joined by many of the students returning to 
class for the first time since Sandy hit last Monday.

Limited service is now available on the M line, which operates around Queens and Brooklyn, and the F line, which connects Brooklyn and lower Manhattan.

Other train lines which also cross the East River - the Q, 2, 3, and D - are running.

On
 Saturday, trains on the 4 and 5 lines began running through pumped-out 
tunnels under the East River into Brooklyn, and the 7 line was running 
from Midtown into Queens.

Flooded: New York City MTA workers used a special Pump Train to pump water out of the flooded Cranberry Street tunnel which carries the A and C trains between Brooklyn and Manhattan

The 6 train, which runs from the Brooklyn Bridge up Lexington Avenue in Manhattan and into the Bronx, is also back on line.

Others, including the N, R, A and E, are fully restored bar short sections at the end of each line.

Yet with tunnels still flooded in 
Williamsburg and Greenpoint in Brooklyn, the L and G trains are likely 
to remain out of service on Monday.

MTA released photos on
 Saturday showing workers draining two of the seven train tunnels 
beneath the East River that were flooded in the aftermath of 
Hurricane Sandy.

On Saturday, MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota said that five off the seven flooded tunnels under the East River have been drained, but much work still remains to be done.

The 14th Street tube, which carries the L train into Williamsburg, is still inundated 'from wall to wall and floor to ceiling'.

Not done yet: Work continues around the South Ferry Subway as vast amounts of water is pumped out of the Station in Battery Park on Friday

Closed: South Ferry station remains closed indefinitely as workers struggle to repair the damage left from Sandy

Massive queues: Because of limited service, New Yorkers are forced to take shuttles; here, lines form outside of Grand Central on November 2

The superstorm that has left 109 dead 
and plunged 60 million people into darkness, sent torrents of water into
 the New York City’s massive subway system that serves 5.5 million 
riders daily, paralyzing mass transit for days.

Trains stopped running at 7pm Sunday 
28 as the MTA preemptively closed down service for only the second time 
in its history in an effort to secure the system, but that did little to
 prevent massive damage.

All
 seven tunnels carrying trains between Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens 
were initially submerged, marking the worst’s disaster in the subway’s 
108-year history.

The long,
 labor-intensive process of ridding the underground arteries off water 
requires hundreds of pumps, including ones powerful enough to empty an 
Olympic-sized pool in less than 15 minutes, as well as help from the 
U.S. Army Corp of Engineers' special SWAT Team.

This stretch looks more like a sewer system than a subway, with the track entirely submerged under floodwater

Maintenance workers can be seen making their way down the tunnel as they continue to pump floodwater from the subway

Workers eventually manage to drain this stretch

The Army’s water-removal team consisting of more than a dozen experts has been using 12 eight-inch pumps and 13 six-inch pumps shipped from New Orleans.

Once bigger pumps arrive, the MTA chairman said it won’t take much time to drain the tunnels. Until then, the job is slow-going.

Each subway tunnel would require four pumps that could remove 1,000-1,500 gallons per minute, a 2011 New York City report estimated. At that rate, about 7.2 million gallons per day, per tunnel could be drained, although it remains unknown exactly how long it would take to drain all of the water.
