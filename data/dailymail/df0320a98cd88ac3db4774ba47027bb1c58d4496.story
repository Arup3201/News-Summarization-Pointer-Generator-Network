Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell raped a young girl in her bed after covering her mouth with her favourite teddy bear, a court heard yesterday.

A jury was told that he even threatened the youngster with death if she mentioned the attacks, which he allegedly carried out over a nine-year period and told her was ‘our little secret’.

‘No one needs to know otherwise you’ll be taken, you’ll die and the evil will come over you,’ he is accused of saying.

Start of trial: Coronation Street actor Michael Le Vell in the dock at Manchester Crown Court while his alleged victim gives evidence behind a curtain yesterday

Ordeal: Le Vell shook his head as the girl behind the curtain sobbed giving evidence to the court yesterday

Le Vell, 48, who has played garage 
mechanic Kevin Webster in the ITV1 soap for 30 years, is facing a total 
of 12 sex charges. He is accused of five counts of rape, three of 
indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two of 
causing a child to engage in sexual activity. He denies all the charges.

The
girl sobbed yesterday as she told a jury at Manchester Crown Court that
she had been repeatedly abused by the soap star from the age of six.

On
one occasion the actor allegedly lay on top her and said: ‘It’s ok, 
you’re safe. Just keep calm, stay asleep ... I’m going to get rid of  
the evil.’

The 48-year-old is then accused of pulling down her pyjamas, covering  her mouth with the teddy bear and raping her in her bed.

The
girl told the court that as she was raped Le Vell would talk to her. 
‘He said I was safe and he was just getting rid of all the evil and all 
the bad that was inside me,’ she said.

‘To stop me speaking he put one of my favourite teddy bears over my mouth so I could still breathe but not say anything.’

The
girl, who cannot be named, wept as she gave evidence from behind a 
screen and said Le Vell simply walked away after the attack.

End of the day: Le Vell, whose real name is Michael Turner, walks out of court through a crowd of photographers chewing on his lip

Exit: Le Vell is rushed from Manchester Crown Court after the 
first day of his trial for a series of alleged child sex offences

Defendant: The actor, pictured being driven home, faces 12 charges of sex offences against children, including five counts of rape, three counts of indecent assault, two counts of sexual activity with a child and two counts of causing a child to engage in sexual activity

‘He just 
got off me and kissed my left cheek and left,’ she said. ‘I was so in 
shock it was like I was not even in my body. I was just motionless.’

The
attacks allegedly began when she was in primary school and continued 
throughout her childhood until she finally told someone.

The
girl, who is now a teenager, would speak only to her teddy bears about 
the abuse. She said it disgusted her and left her feeling ‘upset and 
dirty’.

Le Vell, who was charged under his real name of Michael Turner,   shook his head as the charges were put to him.

The
jury was told that the actor, who lives in Hale, Cheshire, was a 
long-term heavy drinker who had previously sought help for his problem.

He
went to a pub almost every night and would often drink seven or eight 
pints of beer in one sitting. He once turned to Alcoholics Anonymous but
it had not helped and the heavy drinking continued.

The
court heard that at the time the alleged abuse occurred Le Vell was 
having serious marital difficulties with his wife, Janette, and they 
were both under considerable strain.

Denial: Le Vell in the dock where he pleaded not guilty to raping a young girl and 11 other charges

Accusations: The prosecution say Le Vell, whose 
real name is Michael Turner, used threats to keep the silent, but he 
says the alleged victim is a 'fantasist' and an 'attention seeker'

Case: The prosecution, sketched with Le Vell watching on, told the court he was a 'heavy drinker' who abused the girl for eight years

The abuse was said to have taken 
place at various addresses and ended a few years ago.

The girl told the court that she was molested for months before the abuse escalated.

She said Le Vell had threatened her not to tell anyone.

‘I
was very scared because it did not feel right. I did not know what to 
believe or think,’ she said. ‘I would cry and cuddle my teddies and tell
them it doesn’t feel right but it must be.’

She
said on each occasion she felt removed from the actual abuse as if she 
was outside her body watching down on herself and that Le Vell would 
‘stink’ of alcohol and cigarettes.

‘He smelt really, really bad with what I know now to be alcohol,’  she added.

The girl said she became a ‘different child’ as a result of the alleged abuse, and felt ‘very confused’.

Prosecutor
Eleanor Laws said the girl suffered years of nightmares and had wet the
bed until she was 12 because of the alleged abuse.

Hearing: The jury was told that after one alleged attack he 'seemed happy', 'as if it was giving him pleasure'

Attention: The actor listens to his alleged victim giving evidence from behind a screen to protect her identity

Throughout
the girl’s tearful testimony, which lasted for an hour and 45 minutes, 
Le Vell sipped at water from a plastic cup and shook his head 
repeatedly.

Miss Laws said 
Le Vell had first been arrested in September 2011 but the case was 
dropped after an initial investigation. However it was reviewed by the 
Crown Prosecution Service and the actor was re-arrested and charged in 
February this year.

Miss 
Laws said: ‘He answered all questions put to him. He said that she was a
fantasist and an attention-seeker and this was just another of her 
fantasies.’

Originally from
Manchester, Le Vell is one of the longest-serving actors on Coronation 
Street, but has been suspended from the  ITV show until the conclusion 
of the case.

The jury was warned by the  judge to try the real Michael Le  Vell – and not the character he plays on screen.

Before
the trial even began, Judge Michael Henshall asked if any of the 
potential jurors felt they would not be able to try the actor due to 
their interest in the soap opera.

Interest: The Coronation Street actor is one of the most recognisable faces on television after more than 30 years in the soap

Surrounded: Le Vell speaks to a police officer guarding the court as the media swamped him yesterday as his trial started

‘The man on trial is Michael Turner, not the character he  plays,’ he said.

Judge
Henshall allowed the empanelled jurors a 15-minute break to decide 
whether their  feelings about the ITV show would cloud their ability to 
judge the evidence fairly.

Two
jurors – both women – decided they would not be able to try him without
some sort of bias and were allowed to step down. Two others were chosen
in their place.

Eleanor 
Laws QC, prosecuting, then began the opening address, telling the jury: 
‘There is no room in your deliberations for any form of emotion or 
sympathy or prejudice. You must judge the facts of this case using your 
own common sense.’

The jury of eight women and four men will sit through up to two weeks of evidence before being asked to return a verdict.

The case continues.

Career: Le Vell's character Kevin Webster is one of the longest running and popular in British soap history

Long-running character: The actor, who has been on the soap for 30 years, is reportedly set to return, depending on the outcome of the trial
