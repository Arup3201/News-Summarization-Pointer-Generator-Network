A mother-of-four has shed six stone after she living on a diet of fruit and vegetables for two years - to stop her smelling like fish.

Claire Rhodes, 34, has a rare metabolic disorder called Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as fish odour syndrome, where the body can’t break down trimethylamine, which is found in certain foods including milk and eggs.

It causes the chemical to build up in her system before it is released in her sweat, urine, and breath, giving off a strong fishy odour.

Claire was diagnosed two years ago but her unfortunate odour has been following her around since she was in her early twenties.

Strangers have shouted at her in the street and she said it even forced to quit her job as a care assistant in a residential home.

But now thanks to her extreme diet, Claire has been able to keep her fishy odour under control and at the same time lose weight.

Claire, from York, said: 'You’re supposed to have other things in small amounts but they still make me stink.

'So I only eat fruit and vegetables. It’s made me lose six stone.

'The diet does get me down but I have got to stick to it. I wouldn’t be able to go out if I didn’t. I’d be too embarrassed.

'People don’t look at me or comment as much now. I’m starting to live again.'

Claire, who can’t smell her odour, was having up to ten showers a day after family and friends started commenting on her fishy whiff.

She said: 'One day, I was cleaning my teeth just before I was about to go out and my sister told me I should do it at least three times because I stank.

'I brushed it off. I thought it was a typical sister thing.

'More people started commenting on it. It really started getting to me. That’s when I started to become really obsessive with cleaning.'

When she went to see her doctor, they did various tests, which all came back negative.

Claire’s doctor concluded she suffered from body odour and halitosis.

She said: 'I was in and out of my GPs every month. I think they thought I was a hypochondriac.

'I thought it was coming from my teeth so I lied to my dentist and said I was in pain so he removed some of them.

'I was brushing my teeth 20 times a day. I was brushing so hard my gums were receding.'

Around the same time, she started having panic attacks and for a year, she only left the house when she had to go to work.

Claire said: 'I was sick of people looking at me. People would shout at me to brush my teeth.

'People said I smelled of poo, it’s not nice being told that.

'I was working nights in a residential home and when I did hand over, the rest of the staff would move to the other end of the room.

'I knew they were thinking: ‘she doesn’t wash.’ They used to laugh behind my back.'

Claire says she locks herself in her house for the weekend if she fancies a takeaway

Claire even contemplated suicide because of it and she was put on anti-depressants as well as having counselling.

However, after watching a programme about someone with fish odour syndrome, Claire was finally diagnosed with the disorder.

She said: 'As soon as I saw it on the television, I though I bet I have got that. By then, my doctor was sick of me and said I wouldn’t because it’s so rare.

'She agreed to do a test though and when the result came back positive she apologised. It was a real relief to get a diagnosis. I was so happy.'

A dietician has put Claire on a strict diet and warned her to cut out any foods that make her disorder worse.

Most foods cause her to stink, including some fruit and vegetables, so Claire has limited her diet to strawberries, pears, carrots, turnips, potatoes and salad.

Although, she can eat honey and rice in small amounts as well as bread, but only if it is freshly baked.

She said: 'Sometimes I treat myself to a takeaway on a Friday night just lock myself away all weekend.'

Claire said her four children, Danielle, 17, Connor, 13, Ruby, six, and two-year-old Harrison have helped her stay strong.

She said: 'If it wasn’t for them, I wouldn’t be here.'

Dr Robin Lachmann, a consultant in Metabolic Medicine at University College Hospital in London, said said: 'Trimethylaminuria is caused by an inability to break down trimethylamine in the liver.

'There is an inherited form of the condition called Primary Trimethylaminuria. It’s caused by a faulty gene but that is extremely rare.

'In most patients this gene is normal and we think that trimethylamine builds up due either to the fact that the enzyme has stopped working properly, which might be to do with hormone levels, or that the bacteria in their gut are producing too much trimethylamine for the enzyme to cope with.

'There’s no cure but treatment aims to reduce trimethylamine levels in the body and control the symptoms.

'We do this by trying to limit the amount of trimethylamine entering the body. We recommend a special diet which is low in trimethylamine and in another chemical called choline, which can be converted to trimethylamine by gut bacteria.

'We also use a combination of courses of antibiotics and probiotics to try to reduce the numbers of trimethylamine-producing bacteria in the gut.

'Most patients can reduce their trimethylamine levels and their symptoms with these sorts of treatment.'
