The wife of Switzerland’s top banker is enmeshed in insider trading rumours after it was revealed she benefited from a massive currency deal three weeks before her husband moved to protect the Swiss franc for the first time in thirty years.

Philipp Hildebrand, president of the Swiss National Bank, is also accused of making money out of his decision to cap the value of the franc against the US dollar.

Weltwoche magazine said that the SNB President had personally given the orders on currencies and said it had seen his bank statements in which he reaped a 75,000 franc profit in October after purchasing $504,000 in August.

Investigation: Kashya and Philipp Hildebrand both face scrutiny

'It's a classic foreign exchange speculation,' said Weltwoche editor Philipp Gut. 'The only option for Mr Hildebrand is to step down.'

Hildebrand faces scrutiny over the currency trading deal in which his wife profited from the central bank's decision to depress the value of the franc.

His wife Kashya bought half a million US dollars in August and sold them two months later earning her 61,000 francs or $65,000.

Former hedge fund employee Mrs. Hildebrand said she bought 'almost ridiculously cheap' dollars in August to run her art gallery in the centre of Zurich.

'My interest in the dollar purchase was motivated by the fact that it was at a record low and almost ridiculously cheap,' she said, adding that she felt 'comfortable' with the transaction.

Mrs Hildebrand’s trades came about three weeks before the Swiss National Bank rattled currency markets by imposing a ceiling on the franc for the first time in three decades.

In addition, Bank Sarasin, a Basel-based private bank, said it fired an employee who passed data on the trades to Christoph Blocher, vice president of the Swiss People’s Party, who last year called on Philipp Hildebrand to resign after the SNB’s currency transactions led to a record loss.

While Kashya Hildebrand argued that her purchase was business-related, the Swiss Tages-Anzeiger newspaper reported that the money for the dollars came from the sale of a holiday home in Gstaad.

Silvia Oppliger, a spokeswoman at the SNB in Zurich, declined to comment.

The central bank wouldn’t say whether Philipp Hildebrand will give a statement.

Kashya Hildebrand was born in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, to a Pakistani father and an American mother.

At the age of four, she moved to the U.S. and later worked for hedge fund Moore Capital Management in New York, where she met her future husband.

After moving to Switzerland she focused on the art business, opening galleries in Zurich, New York and Geneva. The couple has one daughter and live in Zurich.

The Swiss central bank amassed a record loss of $21bn in 2010 through foreign-currency actions aimed to fight deflation and help exporters.
