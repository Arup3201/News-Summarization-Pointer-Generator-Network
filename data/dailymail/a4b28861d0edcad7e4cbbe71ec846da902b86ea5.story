Pensioner Harry Harrison (pictured at Hull Crown Court) wrote a suicide note and selected pills to take before picking up a six-inch knife from the kitchen and marching to his neighbour's home to stab him

An 82-year-old man wrote a suicide note before grabbing a kitchen knife and attempting to kill his neighbour in a dispute over noise.

Harry Harrison had marched over to confront his neighbour at 4.50am after he said he heard him using his washing machine- which was turned off at the time.

The former serviceman then lunged at his neighbour Jamie Branch-Peard with the 6-inch knife in the hallway of his home.

Harrison stabbed him twice in the stomach and slashed him twice across the chest as he kept repeating: 'You are evil. You should not be here.' 

Harrison, from Bridlington in Yorkshire, told police he had wanted to kill his neighbour and had problems with him for three weeks.

Officers later found the suicide pills laid out in the pensioner's house along with the note to the East Yorkshire Coroner mentioning the washing machine being on at anti-social hours.

He said he had planned to attack Mr Branch-Peard the previous evening after hearing the washing machine on at 10pm, but had second thoughts.

He pleaded guilty to wounding with intent and was sentenced at Hull Crown Court to four-and-a-half years in jail.

One charge of attempted murder was left to lie on the file.

Judge Jeremy Richardson, QC, said: 'This was a serious attack on an innocent man in the early hours of the morning. It has had repercussions for the man, including him having to be off work for four weeks and leave his own home.

'This is a tragedy from everyone's perspective. You are the author of that tragedy.'

Crown barrister John Thackray said Harrison had a number of issues with his neighbour- all of which were found to be false.

He said Harrison had initially taken issue with a garden shed, first claiming it was being used to run a business, and then that it was used for breeding dogs.

East Riding Council officials became involved and advised the neighbour to contact the police. Mr Harrison was spoken to by a Humberside.

A police special constable and told he was being unreasonable and appeared to understand.

However, in the days before the stabbing Mr Harrison had appeared at his neighbour's door and seemed 'very confrontational and wagging his finger' saying he was going to the council about the washing machine.

On April 11, Mr Harrison had laid out pills in his house and written a suicide note before going to confront his neighbour.

'The neighbour opened the door and asked him what it was about,' said Mr Thackray. 'He appeared agitated and was asking him why the washing machine was on. He said it was not, and the neighbour tried to placate Mr Harrison.

'Before he knew it, Mr Harrison had lunged at him - pushing him into his hall. He was grappling with him and trying to push him out of the house.

'He then noticed Harrison had a knife, which he had not seen before, as he had opened the door half asleep. Mr Harrison then began stabbing at him with his right hand towards his legs and stomach. 

'The neighbour described Harrison as crazed. He feared for his life. He said he did not think he would have been able to stop Mr Harrison, if he had not put up such a struggle.

'(Harrison) kept saying: 'You are evil. You should not be here.'

Mr Thackray added  the pair had been grappling in the doorway when the knife blade broke during the struggle. A third party then intervened and pulled the pair apart. 

The police were called and an ambulance took Mr Branch-Peard to Hull Royal Infirmary where he was treated for two knife cuts to the chest, two 1cm puncture wounds to the stomach, and scratches to the neck and arm.

The court heard that the neighbour had to take four weeks off work to recover. He now suffers flash backs and cannot face living in his own home.

Harrison was sentenced to four-and-a-half-years for the frenzied attack when he appeared at Hull Crown Court (pictured) yesterday

Defence barrister Anil Murray said Mr Harrison was a hard working man who had been widowed and described by friends a proud gentleman who they could not believe was capable of such violence.

He said at the time of the attack he suffered from psychosis and paraphrenia - a delusional mental health condition which can happen to elderly, widowed people who live on their own.

Mr Murray said the defence accepted there was never any noise from the washing machine, but it was described by a psychiatrist as an auditory hallucination. He said Harrison had been married for 54 years but his wife died in 2008 and he had since lived on his own.

Sentencing Judge  Richardson told Harrison: 'There are a lot of elderly people who we all have experience of who have irrational thoughts, but what they don't do is pick up a knife and go around to their neighbours and stabbing them in the early hours of the morning.'

'I have given you due weight to your psychosis and mental disorder you were suffering from at the time. Had you been a younger man and not suffering from a mental disorder you would have been sentenced to very much longer. 

'This is a very usual and difficult case

'You are 82 years old. You have no previous convictions and you have led an exemplary life with responsible work and a happy marriage until your wife died in 2008. You now fall to be sentenced for a very serious crime which warrants a custodial sentence.

'Given your age that sentence will fall harder on you. You will be a vulnerable prisoner and the late-evening-of-your life will be spent in misery. You have ruined your own life.'

Harrison, who wore head phones to boost his hearing, smiled to his family in court before being led away to cells below court and a waiting prison van.
