Scottish starlet Ryan Gauld netted his first goals for Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday night, but couldn't stop the Portuguese giants falling to defeat in the League Cup.

The 19-year-old followed up his impressive league debut on Sunday with a brace against top-flight rivals Belenenses as Sporting were dumped out of the competition after a 3-2 defeat.

Gauld, who joined Sporting from Dundee United last summer, caught the eye when he came on as second-half substitute during the 4-2 win against Rio Ave at the weekend, earning him a third consecutive start in the League Cup.

The attacking midfielder made quite the impression again as he scored twice in the first 20 minutes against Belenenses as Sporting raced into a two-goal lead.

The young Scot showed superb technique for the second as he placed a controlled volley into the bottom corner with unerring precision. 

There was to be no happy end for Gauld and his team-mates, however, as Sporting surrendered their two-goal cushion and conceded three second-half goals as they succumbed to a surprise defeat.

'I'm really enjoying the experience, football and the country. I am very happy to be at Sporting,' Gauld said after his two-goal performance.
