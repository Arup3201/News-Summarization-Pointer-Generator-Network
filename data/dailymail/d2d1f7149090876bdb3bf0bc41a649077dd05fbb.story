The birth of a baby is always special, but early this morning a little girl was born who has a special significance to an entire nation.

With the arrival of Jennalyn Sentino the Philippines has become only the 12th country in the world to have a population of more than 100million people.

She was one of 100 babies born in state-run hospitals all over the sprawling archipelago who were given the symbolic designation of '100,000,000th baby'.

The Filipino government will monitor each of the 100 babies to make sure they are getting health services 

The milestone has been a cause for celebration in the Philippines, but officials say it highlights the challenge of providing for more people in the already-impoverished country.

Juan Antonio Perez, executive director of the official Commission on Population, told AFP: 'This is both an opportunity and a challenge... an opportunity we should take advantage of and a challenge we recognise.'

While a growing population means a larger workforce, it also means more dependants in a country where about 25 percent of people are living in poverty, he said.

He said the Philippines had to find a way to bring services to the poorest families while also lowering the average number of children that fertile women will bear in their lifetimes.

'We'd like to push the fertility rate down to two children per (woman's) lifetime,' from the current level of an average of three per woman, he said.

The government has contributed to the celebrations surrounding the births with gifts of cake, clothing and blankets. But it also has plans to monitor each of the 100 children throughout their lives to make sure they getting the health services they need, said Mr Perez.

Clemente Sentino, Jennalyn's 45-year-old father, said he was grateful for government aid, but seemed confident he could support his child and his partner.

He and the child's mother, Dailin Cabigayan, 27, are not yet married. 'She just happened to get pregnant. But we do have plans to get married,' said Mr Sentino, a van driver.

'I make just enough to get by but at least my job pays regularly. We will find a way to make it fit,' he said. 

Population control efforts in the Philippines, where four in five people are Catholic, have been stymied by the influence of the Roman Church, which regards contraception as sinful.

It was only in April that the government finally overcame over a decade of Church opposition to implement a reproductive health law providing the poor with birth control services.

About two to three million women who previously did not have access to family planning now do, said Mr Perez.

Father Melvin Castro, head of the commission on family and life of the country's Catholic bishops, was quoted by a church-run radio station as praising the ballooning population.

There would now be more 'young workers' to power the economy, he said.

President Benigno Aquino's spokesman Herminio Coloma said the milestone showed the importance of making 'the right investments in people'.

The government had prepared for this by spending more on 'human development', particularly education, he told reporters.

Meanwhile, Klaus Beck, country representative of the United Nations Population Fund, endorsed the Philippines' new focus on family planning in a statement issued to coincide with the population landmark.

'Governments that are serious about eradicating poverty should also be serious about providing the services, supplies, information that women, men and young people need to exercise their reproductive rights,' he said.
