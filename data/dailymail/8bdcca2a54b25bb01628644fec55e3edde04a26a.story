Asian Americans--specifically young Asian American women-- are the least likely to be overweight, reveals recent data from The Centers for Disease control and Prevention.

But just because Asians are the slimmest, doesn't mean that they are less likely to suffer from hypertension or other diseases, says the CDC.

The data is based off of Asian American Volunteers who participated in the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2011-2012.Previously to the study there had been a 'scarcity' of health information about the minority group.

Asian Americans are younger and thinner than other American racial groups

66.7 per cent of white Americans are overweight compared to only 38.6 of Asian Americans

Asian Americans had the lowest BMI when compared to other groups

The survey found only 38.6 per cent of Asian American adults have a Body Mass Index (BMI) of over 25. A BMI of 25 or older is the signifier of being overweight, reports the L.A. Times.

The amount of Caucasian and Latinos was astonishingly high at 66.7 per cent overweight for whites, and 78.8 per cent overweight for Hispanics.

Some Asians are heavier than others. Asian men are more likely to be overweight than Asian women. 43 per cent of men have a BMI of over 25 as oppose to 34.7 per cent of women.  

Data from the CDC also shows that Americans over the age of 40 are more likely to be overweight than Americans aged 20-39.

Even though Asian's are thinner than other Americans, their total high cholesterol was 'similar' to other American adults at 10.3 per cent.

Asian's cholesterol was about the same when compared to other groups

Hispanics had higher levels of 'good' cholesterol (HDL) than the  Asians did at 21.8 per cent versus 14.3 per cent.

Asians may be thinner than whites and Latinos, but they have around the same chance of having hypertension at 26.6 per cent.

Non-Hispanic African Americans had the highest prevalence of hyper tension at 42.1 per cent.

The LA Times reports that 1 in 20 American are Asian Americans and Asian qualifies as anyone from Chinese, Asian Indian, Korean, Philippine, or Vietnamese origin. There are 15.4 million Asians in the United States and that figure has increase 40 per cent since 2000.

One of the reasons Asians may be skinniest is because Asians tend to be younger than most Caucasian Americans. 43.6 per cent of the Asian population is between the ages of 20 and 39. 19.3 per cent of Asians are over 60 years old compared with 31.4 per cent and 30 per Cent for whites.

Even though Asians are slim they can still be prone to hypertension

Regardless of weight, the cholesterol of Asians was about the same as whites and Hispanics but lower than African Americans

Asians are younger than Caucasian Americans and may be why they are so thin

Younger people are more likely to be thinner than older people and since Asian Americans are a young minority in America, that could account for their slimness

Asians are just as likely to have high cholesterol or hyper tension as other groups
