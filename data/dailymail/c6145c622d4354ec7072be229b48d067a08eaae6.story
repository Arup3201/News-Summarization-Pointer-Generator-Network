A top barrister who left his judge partner for an Oxford graduate 50 years his junior has claimed he has won the approval of his new lover's mother.

Anthony Arlidge QC jilted Constance Briscoe, 55, who famously wrote her memoir Ugly based on the neglect 
and cruelty she overcame during her upbringing, after 12 years together.

The silver-haired silk  left the £1million home they shared in Clapham, south London, and moved in with barrister Heather Lockwood, 25, at his Inner Temple digs.

Revealing her heartbreak at the split, 
Judge Briscoe, Britain's most famous black judge, branded his actions as
'daft', telling the Daily Mail's Richard Kay: 'I was astonished and terribly upset.'

However, Mr Arlidge, a former Crown Court Recorder whose cases have included 
the prosecution of murderer Jeremy Bamber, said Miss Lockwood's mother Jaqueline, 54, approves of their union.

'I have met her mother and she says 
that if her daughter is happy, then so is she,' he said. 'We are living together. The relationship is going very 
well.

'We share a love of sports — I am taking her to the Olympics to see the football and athletics.'

They are reported to have met at a 
dinner at Middle Temple, in London, last September where she was a 
student and he was Master of Entertainments.

A
grandfather of nine, Arlidge remains married to his wife Enid, the 
mother of his four children.

Their 48th wedding anniversary is next 
week, but they separated nearly three decades ago.

He then lived for 16 years with QC Tracy Ayling and, after that, he romanced Judge Briscoe.

Judge Briscoe, who has two children aged 25 and 22 by solicitor Adam 
Wilson said: ‘Tony left me saying he had fallen in love with a girl who was 
aged 25.

'To fall for someone just a few years older than my 
own son and daughter — effectively his stepchildren — is just plain 
daft.'

Arlidge’s mid-life bombshell occurred just as Judge Briscoe and he were working out ways to spend his impending retirement.

'We
had bought a house in the South of France because I thought he needed 
to have somewhere to enjoy when he retired,' she said.

'That house is one of the things we need to sort out.'

Durham-born Miss Lockwood, described as ‘tall and blonde’, was called to the Bar at the Middle 
Temple two years ago.
