A 14-year-old girl armed herself with a bow and arrow after a woman allegedly entered her family's home and refused to leave in the early hours of the morning.

Mariah Reed was awoken at 5.30am on Saturday as someone rang the doorbell of her Oak Hill, Florida home.

Assuming it was her mother, the girl unlocked the door and turned off the alarm system and went back to bed.

Protective: Mariah Reed, 16, confronted an intruder with her bow and arrow

Caught: Marcia Watson, 54, allegedly entered a stranger's house on Saturday and refused to leave

But rather than her mother, an alleged trespasser, 54-year-old Marcia Watson, entered the home.

Reed only realized it was not her mother inside the home when she heard a female voice she did not recognize, WESH reported.

She texted her mother, who said she was not home yet.

So the teen armed herself with a bow and arrow and confronted Watson, who apologized to the teenager but refused to leave - and instead asked for a glass of water, deputies said.

'I was like, 'What do I do? Who is this lady? This isn't anybody that my parents have mentioned or I've seen,' Reed told the broadcaster.

'I panicked a little and got the bow out of my closet,' Reed said.

'She was like, 'Are you going to shoot me with that?' I'm like, 'Get out of my house right now.'

Stopped: A teenage girl at the house grabbed a bow and arrow and confronted the trespasser before calling her mother, who in turn alerted authorities. Watson was later arrested (file picture)

But the teen went back to her bedroom and reported the incident to authorities.

Before they arrived, Watson poured herself a glass of Pepsi and went into the master bedroom, deputies said.

When officers arrived, Watson apologized and talked about picking flowers and drinking alcoholic beverages, according to a police report.

Watson was taken to the Volusia County Jail on misdemeanor trespassing charges.
