It's every Harry Potter fan's dream - a real-life Hogwarts is currently being built in China.

The enormous new university building in Xinle City, Hebei Province, features a giant clock tower, castle walls and turrets.

The 'magical' building bears an uncanny resemblance to Hogwarts, the school of witchcraft and wizardry from the hit Harry Potter films - actually Alnwick Castle in Northumberland, with a little CGI enhancement.

But designers say the university is modelled on the architecture of the castles of medieval Europe, rather than Harry Potter's school but the resemblance is startling.

The university expects to welcome its first students into the new building later this year but there was no word on whether they would be able to study magic or join the Quidditch society.
