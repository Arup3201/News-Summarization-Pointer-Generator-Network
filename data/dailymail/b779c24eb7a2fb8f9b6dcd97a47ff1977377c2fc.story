Hundreds of people turned out for an emotional memorial service held for up to 60 dogs that died in a suspected arson attack on Manchester Dogs' Home. 

Staff from the home, many of them dressed in uniform, joined around 300 members of the public and wept at Christ Church in Hapurhey, near the gutted dogs' home, as Reverend Mike McGurk led a service paying tribute to the animals who burned to death.

Meanwhile donations to a fund set up to help rebuild the home soared to nearly £1.5million, boosted by a pledge of £25,000 from X Factor guru Simon Cowell.

Cowell, a renowned dog lover, not only promised to write a large cheque for the appeal, but also vowed to take the three men who rescued the surviving dogs from the blaze on a luxury holiday.

Jason Dyer, his son Danny Vere, and Dean Rostock risked their own lives by running into the flames and pulling dogs out as fire raged through the home on Thursday night. 

Cowell said he would pay for the three of them to go on an all expenses-paid holiday after a Twitter user suggested it to him. 

After learning of the fire, Cowell wrote on Twitter: 'Unbelieveable!  Donation on its way.'

Asked if he would give the men a holiday, he replied straight away: 'Yes I will.' 

Today it emerged that the family of the boy suspected of starting the blaze may be moved by police over fears of violent reprisals from animals lovers.

Relatives of the 15-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are said to be taking advice from police over their personal safety after threats against them were posted on social media websites.

The boy was arrested less than an hour after police were alerted to the blaze, and has now been released on bail while police inquiries continue.

Feelings were running high at last night's service, where the home's manager vowed not to move the local area.

As members of the congregation sobbed and clutched their dogs to them, Lisa Graham said: 'We've been here 115 years - this is our community.

'This is where we are needed and it would be wrong to leave.'

Mr McGurk said: 'The reaction from the public has been phenomenal but it's not really surprised me.

'I've always had faith in this community and its ability to care for one another, particularly in times of adversity.'

Gutted: Manchester Dogs' Home was left gutted by the blaze, a suspected arson, which began on Thursday

News of the tragedy prompted dozens of people to adopt the dogs who survived the fire over the weekend.

An impromptu dog catwalk was staged at the Cheshire Dogs' Home in Warrington, where many of the survivors were taking.  By the end of the weekend, more than 70 dogs had been rehomed, leaving all the Manchester dogs bar one - Staffordshire bull terrier cross, Tia - with new homes.

Meanwhile Coronation Street actor Jack P Shepherd had to issue an apology after joking about the fire on Twitter.

Shepherd, 26, who plays David Platt in the soap, caused uproar on Twitter when he posted 'I have a million 'hot dog' jokes'.

When people responded in anger he added: 'You guys need to lighten up. £GetItLightenUp.'

This morning the total pledged to the charity fund was more than £1.4m as dog-lovers rushed to help

It led to outrage on the social networking website. Some even called on people to boycott the soap.

Later, Shepherd tweeted an apology and said he had made a donation to the dogs' home.

He wrote: 'I sincerely apologise for any offence I have caused. This was not intended to be a malicious tweet and I didn't consider the offence it would cause.

'At the time I didn't realise the scale of the tragedy but that doesn't excuse my behaviour. I now realise how insensitive I have been. I have made a donation to the MCR dogs home and I'm very sorry for my behaviour.'
