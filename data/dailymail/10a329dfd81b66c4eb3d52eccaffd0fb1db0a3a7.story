Natalie Gumede made a spectacular return to Strictly Come Dancing last night - earning the joint highest score of the series so far.

The former Coronation Street star, who looked radiant in a red flapper dress scored 39 out of a maximum 40 with her partner Artem Chigvintsev for their rendition of the Charleston for the BBC show.

Judges Darcey Bussell, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman awarded perfect tens while Craig Revel Horwood gave them a nine.

Red alert: Former Coronation Street star Natalie Gumede scored 39 out of a maximum 40 for her rendition of the Charleston

The routine at Blackpool's Tower Ballroom marked a triumphant comeback for the 29-year-old star, who missed last week's show after fainting twice during rehearsals.

But the decision to award thre tens sparked complaints from fans.

One tweeted: 'Why did no one notice Natalie was totally out of time?'

Many viewers thought BBC presenter Susanna Reid and her partner Kevin Clifton, who also scored a 39 for their paso doble, were better.

Once again Revel Horwood killed off hopes of a maximum score by awarding them nine.
