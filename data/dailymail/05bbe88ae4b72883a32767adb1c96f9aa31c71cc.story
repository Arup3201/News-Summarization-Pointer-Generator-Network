Two shoplifters have been compared to Little Britain's Andy and Lou after using a wheelchair to steal from a store.

CCTV shows a man pushing an apparently wheelchair-bound woman into a service station on the A45 near Coventry earlier this month.

But when other shoppers backs are turned, the woman jumps out of the seat and starts stuffing items into her coat.

CCTV from a Marks and Spencer store at a service station in the Midlands shows a woman being pushed into the shop in a wheelchair before jumping up and stealing food

Police are hunting the woman and her accomplice after the thefts near Coventry on January 11

The footage later shows the woman having returned to the wheelchair as she is pushed out of the store by the man.

Coventry Police said the pair 'seem to have taken their cue from the cult television comedy duo Andy and Lou'.

A spokesman said: 'The woman in a wheelchair was caught on CCTV getting out of her seat and walking completely unaided around the store, in order to select goods from the shelves and conceal them under her coat.

'The man with her, who pushes her around the store, is also captured loading the woman’s rucksack with food items from the Marks and Spencer food store at a service station on the A45 in Finham.'

The pair - both black and believed to be in their 30s - made off with £60 worth of meat from the food store

The spokesman added: 'Between them, the pair managed to get away with around £60 worth of packaged meat during their spree, which happened at around 5pm on 11 January.

'The woman in the wheelchair is described as black, in her mid-30s, around 5ft 7ins tall while the man is described as black, in his mid-30s and around 6ft tall.'

Andy and Lou became popular after Little Britain was first screened in 2003. Matt Lucas played Andy, who feigned disability and let his hapless carer, Lou, played by David Walliams, run around after him.

The sketches were made famous by Andy's catchphrases; 'yeah, I know', 'I want that one' and 'don't like it'.

Police are urging anyone who recognises the pair to ring 101 or the anonymous charity Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.
