A Wisconsin man has been arrested for allegedly shooting a stranger after a scuffle over a photo-bombing incident.

Thamar Harper, 29, was charged Monday with first-degree attempted homicide in the shooting of 23-year-old Marcus McKinnis the day before in the Eagles Club parking lot in Beloit.

According to a criminal complaint, McKinnis and several friends were attempting to take a group picture at around 1.40am Sunday when the suspect jumped into the frame.

The complaint states that the 29-year-old and the group started fighting and security asked them to leave.

Harper then allegedly followed McKinnis and at least two other men to their cars.

According to investigators, Harper pulled out a small semi-automatic handgun from his pants pocket and squeezed off several rounds, striking McKinnis about six times, GazetteXtra reported.

An officer who responded to a report of shots fired saw McKinnis slumped in the driver’s seat. When he opened the door, the 23-year-old victim collapsed onto the cop.

McKinnis was rushed to Mercy Hospital and was later transferred to University Hospital, Madison, where he was listed in fair condition Monday.

According to his Facebook page, the 23-year-old lives in Markham, Illinois, some two hours away from Beloit, and has two young children.

Another man sustained non-life-threatening injuries, and was treated and released at the scene.

Harper was ordered held on $50,000 cash bond at the Rock County Jail. He is due in court Friday.
