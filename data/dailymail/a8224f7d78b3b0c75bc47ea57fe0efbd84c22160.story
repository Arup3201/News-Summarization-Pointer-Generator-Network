This adorable puppy might look like the most chilled canine on the planet as he blissfully settles into bath time, but just two weeks ago he was close to death.

The two-week-old was close to death when he was found abandoned in a dumpster with his two sisters - but now it looks like his troubles are a million miles away.

They were found by Dallas Animal Service in Texas and referred to the DFW Rescue Me animal shelter where volunteer Claire Fowler was tasked with looking after them.

Spa day: The puppy, who does not yet have a name, relaxed in a warm bath in a sink

Rest and recovery: The puppy almost died when he was dumped in a dumpster with his two sisters

The 21-year-old student said: 'When they were found they were covered in fleas and would not have survived without their mother.

'The little guys need round-the-clock care - they can't use the restroom by themselves or even regulate their own body temperature.

'I do everything for them and they need to be fed every couple of hours.'

She added: 'I decided to film him in the bath because he was enjoying it so much and I really wanted to capture it.

'He just looked so content.

Drying off: The puppy loves bath-time, unlike his sisters, and made sure to dry off in a towel afterwards

Lucky to be alive: The three puppies were thrown in a dumpster but were saved by the Dallas Animal Service

'His sisters definitely do not enjoy bath time as much as this little guy but it needs to be done.

'Their mother isn't here to keep them clean so I have to do it and then blow dry them - they need constant care and attention.'

Because they are so young the puppies are yet to be named.

'We are trying to think of some really strong names for the three of them,' added Claire.

'But they've only just opened their eyes and they do a lot of sleeping.

Nap time: The three puppies have been getting plenty of shut eye to recover from the experience

Healthy appetites: The tiny canines are being looked after at the DFW Rescue Me animal shelter in Dallas

'As they get older we will start to see more of their personalities and will have a better idea of what to call them.'

With Christmas soon approaching Claire has some advice for anybody who is thinking of buying a puppy.

She said: 'People should be looking to adopt puppies instead of buying them at Christmas time - there are so many puppies in shelters that really need a loving home.

'But that advice should be taken onboard all year round.'

Playing coy: The little puppy has been keeping a low profile at the rescue center and getting plenty of sleep

Adopt me: The puppies about being looked after by volunteers but are looking for a new home
