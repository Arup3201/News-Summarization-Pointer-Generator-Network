The lawyer representing embattled former 7th Heaven star Stephen Collins in his divorce case was arrested on a DUI charge in Hollywood Friday.

Mark Vincent Kaplan was taken into custody shortly before midnight after being pulled over by sheriff's deputies on Sunset Boulevard. 

TMZ reported that the celebrity divorce lawyer failed a field sobriety test and was booked into jail on a charge of driving under the influence.

Kaplan was later released home with a citation.

The attorney made a name for himself by representing Kevin Federline in his 2007 divorce from pop star Britney Spears after two years of marriage.

Kaplan also took on Chris Judd as a client following his breakup from Jennifer Lopez in 2002.

Most recently, Kaplan was hired by actor and alleged child molester Stephen Collins to represent him in his contentious divorce from Faye Grant.

Kaplan, who has been practicing family law for 40 years, has accused Grant of doing everything in her power to destroy her estranged husband's reputation in an effort to reach a more favorable settlement for herself, including leaking a damaging secret recording made during a therapy session in 2012.

The explosive tape, which was released in October, featured Collins, 67, confessing to sexually abusing young girls. He has not been charged with any crime.

Grant, 57, has repeatedly denied leaking the recording to TMZ. She has claimed that she only handed over the tape to police for investigative purposes after her husband refused to seek treatment.

The couple's divorce trial has been delayed until January 5 after Grant's lawyer, Larry Ginsberg, dropped her as a client two weeks ago due to an alleged disagreement over attorney's fees.

The trial would determine how the couple divide their assets, and how much spousal support Grant should receive.

Kaplan said earlier this month that his client has spent $1million already on attorneys' and experts' fees in the case, and the delay in the proceedings would probably him another $200,000.

Collins has lost several TV and film roles as a result of the scandal surrounding the leaked tape, including a $75,000 part in the upcoming comedy Ted 2.

The actor is best known for playing a well-meaning pastor and father of seven in the family-friendly TV series 7th Heaven that aired between 1996 and 2007. 

Faye Grant, who is also an actress, stated in court filings that she had been forced to put her career on hold during her marriage to Collins. She is seeking to maintain $13,000 a month in spousal support payments.
