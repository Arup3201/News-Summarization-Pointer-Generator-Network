There is a narrative arc in every RomCom that sees the two protagonists enjoy an initial spark, fall-out over some unforeseen development, then get back together with a bang.

It’s a little like that with Aston Villa and form right now. Their season showed blossoming signs with 10 points from four games, capped by Gabriel Agbonlahor’s winner at Anfield.

But since then it has been the cold shoulder treatment; four successive defeats and no goals. Monday night’s match against Queens Park Rangers presents the opportunity for their relationship with points to be rekindled. And in front of the cameras, for added cinematic effect.

The coming encounter marks the end of a horrific run of fixtures that saw Villa play each of last season’s top five teams.

Victory at Liverpool in the first of those, following wins over Stoke and Hull and a draw with Newcastle, added gloss to a solid campaign start.

Successive defeats to Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Everton have though brought dawning realisation that this may yet turn into another difficult season.

Villa were second favourites in each of those encounters so it is no surprise they failed to emerge with anything. Rather it is the manner of some performances which heightens the importance of the match at Loftus Road.

Since their impressive start, Villa have struggled with four defeats in a row

It is 441 minutes since Agbonlahor poked in from close range to defeat Liverpool. Burnley territory. Never before have Villa gone five consecutive Premier League matches without scoring.

Even during the good times this lack of creativity was a concern. Villa amassed their ten points through just four goals and six shots on target.

Since then they have worked the opposition goalkeeper with shots another six occasions in total. It is a paucity that needs addressing.

As we saw against Liverpool, QPR are a team who can do your work for you. Aiming for the feet of Richard Dunne and Steven Caulker with crosses is one tactic, sure. But Paul Lambert cannot rely on such generosity.

Villa's form has been like a film script - they enjoyed the initial period, but have hit a snag in recent weeks

Villa must now reignite their season, beginning with their trip to QPR on Monday night

Christian Benteke started at Goodison Park but is clearly a way off reaching his physical peak. Villa badly missed the energy and forward momentum Fabian Delph provides from midfield.

It may be a tactical tweak is required to generate greater attacking thrust. The diamond might do it, positioning both Benteke and Agbonlahor as strikers, twinning strength with pace, and having Tom Cleverley in behind.

The midfielder was at his best for Manchester United operating in and around the box, playing one-twos to unlock defences, before recent seasons saw him further withdrawn.

It would mean Ashley Westwood sitting, supported by wingers Kieran Richardson, adept at defending, and either Charles N’Zogbia or Jack Grealish, inclined to attack. Given N’Zogbia’s performances of late it may be time to hand the 19-year-old his first start.

It would be a departure from Lambert’s trusted 4-3-3 formation and a defensive risk given the groin injury to Philippe Senderos – he provided excellent organisaion alongside Ron Vlaar for the first three games – but it might be equally dangerous to continue as it is.

QPR, for all the subsequent flabgate fallout, showed enough against Liverpool to suggest Loftus Road under the floodlights can be the setting for a twist in the script.
