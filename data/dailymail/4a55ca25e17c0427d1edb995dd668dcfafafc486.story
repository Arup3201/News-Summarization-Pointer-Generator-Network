The lives of Sarah, 6, and Ethan, 10, were torn apart this year when their 12-year-old brother stabbed them and shot dead their parents.

Now the siblings are trying to build a new life in Missouri with their uncle and aunt after leaving Burlington, Colorado, where the tragedy struck.

Wally and Sylvia Long adopted the two after they miraculously survived the attack at their home that saw their brother jailed for seven years.

Recovering: The lives of Sarah, 6, and Ethan, 10, were flipped on their heads this year when their 12-year-old brother stabbed them and killed their parents

The unidentified devout Christian boy went on the rampage in March, shooting Ethan twice and stabbing him six times, reported 9 News.

He also cut Sarah’s throat and stabbed her several times. The children survived, but he shot dead his parents Charles, 50, and Marilyn Long, 51.

‘My brother killed them,’ Sarah Long told 9 News. ‘He also hurt me and Ethan. I don't know why he did that. Now he's in prison.’

She said she is pleased he is in prison ‘because he won't touch us ever again’, and likes calling her adoptive parents ‘Uncle Dad' and 'Uncle Mom’.

‘I think the only reason I remember is
because it hurt,’ Ethan Long told 9 News, adding he hit his pain 
medication button ‘as much as I could’.

Wally and Sylvia home-school the 
children after prayers and breakfast and said they had prayed about 
adopting more children in the past.

‘We're just overwhelmed that they 
survived,’ Mrs Long told 9 News. ‘We have the privilege of raising them 
for their mom and daddy.’

Her husband said they are getting 
used to a six-year-old running around the house and a 10-year-old asking
questions about everything they do.

Mr Long added that they still do not know why the jailed brother went on his crazy rampage, but perhaps ‘something just broke in his mind’.

Ethan Long

The killings shocked the Burlington community, which remembered the killer as a ‘well-socialised’ boy, who greeted visitors at Sunday church services.

The children often ask their adoptive parents ‘Will you keep us safe?’ Now Sarah wants to use all her savings on a surprise family present.

Mr Long told 9 News he wanted to thank people across the U.S. who have been praying for the family. ‘It means a lot,’ he said.
