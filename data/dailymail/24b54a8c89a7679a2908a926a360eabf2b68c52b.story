Jermain Defoe’s fall-out with his Major League Soccer side Toronto just one truncated season into a four-year contract is being blamed in Canada on his formidable mother Sandra.

Defoe is expected to return to the Premier League with QPR in the January window, as manager Harry Redknapp indicated on Thursday, provided terms can be agreed.

And Toronto have briefed local media that Sandra is heavily responsible for ‘mama’s boy’ Jermain leaving so prematurely.

Toronto chief Tim Leiweke felt he had to seriously impress Sandra to get her son to Canada in the first place.

This included having rap star Drake and basketball great LeBron James make a fuss of her. And the multi-layered contract that Defoe signed with Toronto included luxury accommodation for his mum.

Now Leiweke says: ‘We have to determine does Jermain want to be here, but we’re not going to give him away.’

The way the NFL have taken ownership of Wembley ahead of the Jacksonville v Dallas match on Sunday — with the media attending Roy Hodgson’s England squad announcement faced with no-entry signs everywhere — suggests they would take precedence over the national game if ever an American football franchise came to London.

England cricketer Matt Prior has stayed quiet since being slated in Kevin Pietersen’s book as the ‘Big Cheese’ in the dressing room. But Prior now appears to have subtly struck back by retweeting the newspaper headline: ‘How All Blacks assistant coach Gilbert Enoka turned side around with no-d***heads policy.’

The prawn-sandwich brigade have embraced the Rugby World Cup to the extent £50million of corporate hospitality has been sold for the tournament with a year to go, including all Twickenham boxes for the 10 games there. The biggest task by far for the organisers is filling Cardiff’s Millennium Stadium, where eight matches are being held. The Welsh rugby public are not used to paying for the high-price categories.

Green snubs BBC pal

It’s the talk of the BBC that Alan Green, football commentator on 5 Live and recently Match of the Day, turned down an invitation to a special Beeb farewell party for Mike Ingham in Manchester this week. Ingham, who was Green’s partner on big-match radio commentaries for nearly 30 years, retired after the World Cup.

Green also snubbed an FA reception where a presentation was made to Ingham in Miami ahead of the World Cup. He claimed he knew nothing about it but was seated just outside the hotel function room ahead of the bash.

Meanwhile Jenson Button, without an F1 drive next year, could end up as a Sky pundit with Damon Hill keen on a reduced workload.

Sir Dave Richards, ex-chairman of the Premier League and yet to be properly replaced since his retirement in 2012, has been helping former FA board colleague Phil Gartside search for a buyer for debt-ridden Bolton Wanderers. This included a trip to Thailand, where Richards introduced Gartside to potential investors.

England kick off their third rugby game of the autumn series against Samoa on Saturday, November 22 at 7pm, partly as a dress rehearsal for World Cup night matches. However, the tournament opens with a Friday night game at Twickenham when commuter traffic will be a major problem. ER 2015 have started their Olympic-style transport and opening ceremony planning but didn’t want to impact too much on the autumn series with a Friday game.

The most notable aspect of the extra £1.18m being given to British basketball, brokered by Minister for Sport Helen Grant to allow them to compete in tournaments, is that the cash is coming from Sport England’s grass-roots budget. UK Sport are only providing technical support so their snubbing of sports — including basketball — with no medal potential at Rio 2016 is not compromised ahead of a consultation exercise into the flawed policy.
