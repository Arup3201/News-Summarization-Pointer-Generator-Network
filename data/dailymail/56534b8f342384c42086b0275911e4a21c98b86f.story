Police are hunting for four men in their late teens and early 20s accused of gunning down and stabbing a 40-year-old man murdered in front of his wife and daughter outside their home.

Victor Quevedo, of Houston, Texas, was pulling into his apartment complex on Saturday night with his wife and her 13-year-old daughter when a group of men ambushed the vehicle, demanding their cell phones and wallets.

Investigators say Mr Quevedo was killed after a brief struggle with one of the suspects.

Victim: Victor Quevedo, of Houston, Texas, was returning home Saturday night with his wife and step-daughter when the family was ambushed

The Houston Chronicle reports Mr Quevedo was pronounced dead at the scene.

According to the Harris County 
Sheriff’s Office, the family was driving into their apartment complex at the 13000 block of Bissonnet St when they were attacked.

Mr Quevedo's step-daughter, Jacqueline Castillo, told KHOU.com of how the scene unfolded; and within moments, he was dead.

'He was trying to push them away from us, like trying to make them go away,' the teenager remembered.

'Then we hear a shot and them Mom tells them to, "please, don’t hurt my family, don’t hurt my family, don’t kill them.'"

KHOU reports two of the suspects had knives, and two had guns.

'They just got my backpack and before
they went to their car they gave my Dad another shot on the face and 
that’s what killed him faster because he was choking on his own blood,' 
she told the station.

The bag the suspects fled with contained two cell phones and a hairbrush, but no cash.

Mr Quevedo's widow, 36-year-old Alicia Rodriguez, fought back tears as the spoke to the Chronicle about the senseless killing.

'I 
feel sad and mad that he is gone. They came to shoot him for nothing,' she said. 'He is gone for no reason.'

Mr Quevedo, a Mexican national, worked in the air conditioning business in Houston.

The Harris County 
Sheriff’s Office believes all four suspects are Hispanic.
