Friends and family of Nicole Gillespie have taken to social media to pay tribute to the inspirational Aussie cancer battler who died at the age of 32 on Saturday.

Ms Gillespie ensured she made the most of every single moment of her life by creating a bucket list soon after she was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma four years ago.

She was able to complete her final wish by attending this year's Logie Awards in a $10,000 designer gown.

Ms Gillespie was also able to tick off her list: skydiving, feeding tigers, swimming with dolphins, flying over Uluru in the Northern Territory, meeting the cast and crew of Home And Away and the Queensland State of Origin Maroons team.

Long-supporting friend and melanoma survivor Jay Allen said the Queensland resident was brave.

'She was so strong-willed, didn't complain once and just wanted to do what she had to do because she couldn't change what happened to her,' Mr Allen told the Daily Telegraph.

'I'm going to carry on the way she acted for the rest of my life.'

Mr Allen, who also is also on a mission to ban sun-bed around the world, also paid his respects online.

'This morning we lost a beautiful lady and dear friend of mine Nicole Gillespie to this devastating disease #melanoma,' he wrote.

'I will never forget you Nicole. Its just so sad and heartbreaking.'

One friend, Jenny Hutchins, wrote: 'Rest peacefully Nicole. You fought so hard and with so much courage and grace.'

Words of comfort were shared by Cheryl Gavan: 'Jay there's no room for tears in heaven - Nicole will be smiling down on you now, you bring a lil bit of heaven to everyone you help here on earth, god bless Nicole xo.'
