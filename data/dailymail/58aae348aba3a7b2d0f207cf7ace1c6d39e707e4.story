It wouldn’t have been the first time an office party has got out of hand.

But when BBC bosses planned a fond farewell to their headquarters, they probably didn’t expect the behaviour of staff and guests to degenerate quite so dramatically.

A gathering to mark the closure of BBC Television Centre reportedly spiralled out of control with revellers heard having sex in an office and seen making off with souvenirs from the building.

One guest posted an update on Twitter during the drink-fuelled gathering after hearing an amorous encounter in the building – affectionately known as the ‘doughnut’ because of its curved exterior and hollow centre.

Producer Helen Williamson said: ‘At the BBC’s “goodbye TVC party”… did a  nostalgic walk of the donut & heard someone s******* in one of the offices. Sackable offence?’

Around 1,500 BBC employees were invited to the party last Thursday, held in three recording studios in the building at White City in West London. Radio 1 DJs Scott Mills and Sara Cox provided the music as staff posted pictures of themselves dancing and drinking.

The institution has been the BBC's home since 1960 but will close on Easter Sunday and be turned into flats

Although most of the interior had been
 stripped of furniture and equipment, security staff were on hand. Large
 notices were placed on the walls, warning employees not to take BBC 
property.

One read: ‘We’re 
keen to keep TVC looking smart and presentable. It’s still a working 
building, so please don’t take any souvenirs as thefts will  be taken 
seriously.’

However, presenter Vernon Kay – married to Strictly Come Dancing host Tess Daly – was reportedly stopped by security as he left the building with a dressing room sign.

He is reported saying: ‘It was a sign from my first-ever TV dressing room so I couldn’t resist taking it.’

Another corporation star – comedian 
Rhys Thomas – posted a picture of himself on Twitter holding a BBC 
directions board with the message: ‘This is the bit of television centre
 I stole last night.’

Presenter Dave Berry added: ‘Off to ghost town BBC
 television centre to work a stunning TV show project and also to pinch 
some stuff.’

The day after 
the farewell party, photographer Ray Burmiston said: ‘Feels like a 
ghostown [sic]. Everything’s gone . If it’s not nailed down its been 
nicked for a memento!’

In a second evening of celebrations on Friday, Madness performed live outside the building.

Journalist Julia Raeside said: ‘Drunk watching Madness. Might smoke indoors. It’s that kind of night.’

BBC TV Centre has been the Corporation’s home since 1960.

It has been sold for £200million and will close on Easter Sunday. It will be converted into a hotel, flats, a cinema and office space. BBC staff have relocated to central London.

A BBC spokesman said: ‘As we leave Television Centre it’s essential that items remain in place to avoid any replacement costs and to keep the building presentable and functional after the BBC’s exit.’
