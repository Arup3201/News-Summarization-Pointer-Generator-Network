The impact climate change will have on the world's future is a subject of hot debate - some experts believe the effects will be minimal while others have predicted scenes of devastation.

Now artists have imagined how London’s landmarks may change in a hundred years or more, including soldiers riding on camels at Horse Guard’s parade, futuristic flying cars above the City, a giant lily pond at Piccadilly Circus, and the Houses of Parliament marooned in water.

In different scenarios, global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways, flooding the city, or conversely turning it into a barren, desert-like wasteland.

London in 2100+? Artists have imagined how London’s landmarks may change, including soldiers riding on camels at Horse Guard’s parade, futuristic flying cars above the City (pictured), a giant lily pond at Piccadilly Circus, and the Houses of Parliament marooned in water

In one image, London looks noticeably more hi-tech with more skyscrapers than ever and hovering cars as well as zeppelins. The city is cramped with buildings that give off an electric glow.  As far as the eye can see there is no sign of nature.

While some images depict the catastrophic effects of climate change other views, created from the perspective of The Shard skyscraper, reveal how towering buildings will change the capital’s skyline.

The realistic mock-ups were created by future forecasting company GMJ and take into account approved planning applications in boroughs all over the capital.

That sinking feeling: In different scenarios, global warming have ravaged the capital in different ways, flooding the West Eng  or conversely turning it into a barren desert-like wasteland. Here, Piccadilly Circus is under water, but is being put to good use with wind turbines generating power

Turning up the heat: This image suggests that London will be hotter than it is now, with soldiers on camelback rising into Horse Guard's Parade

A wash out? In a survey commissioned by The View From The Shard, around five million Londoners said they think the capital will one day be flooded, so that Westminster (pictured) might be partially under water or even a little bit like Venice - maybe politicians will commute by boat

They include more than 100 new points of interest from The View from The Shard’s North, East, South and West views, some of which are shown here.

A study commissioned by The View from The Shard, found 29 per cent of Britons believe their capital will be unrecognisable by 2030.

Incredibly, one in five people living in the capital think it would be better off as its own country.

While more and more skyscrapers are springing up, 80 per cent of those surveyed say they are concerned about diminishing green space and 60 per cent want to see more bikes on the road instead of futuristic cars – hovering or not.

Londoners predict that by 2030 free Wi-Fi will be everywhere and we will no longer use paper money, preferring mobile payment.

Back to basics: In an exhibition at The Shard skyscraper, visitors will be able to ‘look into the future’ using interactive ‘tellscopes’ that juxtapose images from the Museum of London’s archive stretching all the way back to Roman times, with modern day and 2030 London. This is one of the most whimsical images created showing a paddy field just outside what is the Houses of Parliament

A view of the future? While some images depict the catastrophic effects of climate change other views, created from the perspective of The Shard skyscraper, reveal how towering buildings will change the capital’s skyline (a view from the north said is pictured). The images, which are as realistic as possible, were created by futurescasting company GMJ and take into account approved planning applications in boroughs all over the capital

Controversially, more than five million people in the UK believe there will be no monarchy in 15 years and one in 10 think that London will one day be waterlogged like Venice.

In an exhibition at The Shard skyscraper, visitors will be able to ‘look into the future’ using interactive ‘tellscopes’ that juxtapose images from the Museum of London’s archive stretching all the way back to Roman times, with modern day and 2030 London.

A series of events over the coming week called ‘London As I See It’ will play host to architecture, engineering and literary experts who will discuss what London might look like in 30 years.

‘With the highest view over one of the best cities in the world, there is really no better place to think about what the future holds for our society,’ said Clive Stephens, CEO of The View from The Shard.

Transformation in progress: A study commissioned by View From The Shard, found 29 per cent of Britons think their capital will be unrecognisable by 2030, and 38 per cent of Londoners. These are two of the skyscrapers that are planned and will alter the city's skyline. The Canaletto is pictured left and 52 Lime Street, right

Londoners like their personal space: Incredibly, one in five people living in the Capital think it would be better off as its own country. While more and more skyscrapers are springing up (those planned by 2030 are shown in this view from The Shard), 80 per cent of people in the UK want more green space and 60per cent want to see more bikes on the road instead of futuristic cars - hovering or not

GMJ said: ‘This initiative gets the public directly involved in the debate about the kind of city we want and are about to get. It shows people how the skyline will change and tells them about each project in detail.

‘For us it’s a huge task. Our aim is to add as many new and significant projects to each view. We want to use this release and launch as a ‘call out’ to developers and architects to provide us with the information we need to add more and more projects to this and the other views.’

To support the futuristic view of what the capital might look like in 2030 The View from The Shard commissioned a survey to find out how the public think London’s skyline and urban society will change over the next 15 years – and the results have been staggering. From transport and climate through to architecture and politics, the Future View from The Shard Report explored a wide range of topics and issues. 

Picture perfect? Controversially, over five million people in the UK think there will be no monarchy in 15 years and one in 10 think that London will one day be waterlogged like Venice. Here is an imagined photograph taken from Waterloo Bridge in 2030
