A new 'planking' style craze is sweeping the internet during the big freeze - posing naked in the snow.

The impromptu challenge was started by Wiltshire care worker Leanne Myers, 40, who posed in her underwear with neighbour Danielle Smith in a bid to amuse friends.

But after posting the photo on Facebook the idea quickly snowballed and a page dedicated to naked snow pictures went viral.

The group now has more than 5,500 likes and 250 photos showing people of all ages stripping down and covering their unmentionables in imaginative ways.

Leanne, from the village of Durrington, has been amazed by the response and has had offers of photos from as far afield as Abu Dhabi.

She said: 'It is totally amazing, I really had no idea it would take off like this.

'People have really embraced it, and a lot of the pictures are of friends of friends, but now there's some coming in from people I don't know.

'I've had interest from Abu Dhabi and America and people messaging me saying "we're not in Wiltshire, can we send in a pic?".

'They are welcome from anywhere, as long as they are kept tasteful.'

The group - entitled 'Wiltshire, let's get naked in the snow!' - began on Friday after Leanne and her fellow careworkers battled to get to those they support in the overnight deluge of snow

After work, as a way to amuse her friends and family, she decided to pose in her underwear with next-door neighbour Danielle and then invited friends to do the same.

'I really did just think it would be a
 bit of fun, to provide a bit of a giggle for maybe 50 of my friends and
 neighbours in the village, but on Saturday it really took off,' she 
added.

'My
 husband and I went out on Saturday to the club in the village and a lad
 said "Hi Leanne, I didn't recognise you with your clothes on". That's 
when I knew it had gone a bit further than that.'

Within
 24 hours the page had gone viral, and hundreds of people had also 
shared photos of ever-more inventive ways of obscuring their dignity - 
using snowmen, bottles, scarves and even a frying pan.

Now Leanne said she wants to turn what started as 'nothing more than a bit of a giggle' into a fundraiser for a hospital that helped her daughter when she was born prematurely.

Ellie, now 12, was born six and a half weeks early and was immediately rushed to the neonatal intensive care unit at Odstock Hospital, in Salisbury, Wiltshire, where she was diagnosed with a heart condition.

At just two-years-old the tot underwent major heart surgery at the neighbouring John Radcliffe Hospital and has now made a full recovery.

The mum-of-two said she could not express enough thanks to both hospitals and really wanted to use the opportunity she had been given to help out the Salisbury District Hospital Stars Appeal.

She said: 'When Ellie was born we were separated from her and couldn't stay on her ward, it was awful.

'The support and treatment we 
received was second to none and without the hard work and dedication of 
the staff at both hospitals we never would have got through.

'If I can manage to raise some funds 
to allow them to create a place where a family can stay with their child
 it will be worth it.

'And in 2000 when she was born the 
hospital didn't even have the equipment to know what heart condition 
Ellie had so we were rushed in an ambulance between hospitals.

'From that day on I have always wanted to help them in some way.

'I'm just so excited, I have managed 
to do this, I can't wait to help them in some way. They really deserve 
the help, they are fantastic.

'I would love to be able to just provide something for them like a machine, something big, something to say thank you.'

Leanne added that her husband Mark, 39, was also very supportive and had already uploaded his own photo on to the site.

She has two daughters, Ellie, 12 and Tilly-Louise, 8.
