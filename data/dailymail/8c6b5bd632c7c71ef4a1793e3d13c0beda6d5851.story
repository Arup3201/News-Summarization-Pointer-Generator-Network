An eight-year-old boy testified in court today at the double murder trial of his father after allegedly watching as the accused shot his mother in the head. 

The third-grader told jurors that his father, Joel Hayden of New Bedford, Massachusetts, was inside his mother's house in New Gloucester, Maine, when he saw one of the victims, 28-year-old Trevor Mills, fall through a glass door. 

The boy, who was seven at the time, said Hayden then went outside and shot his mother on their driveway while he watched on July 25, 2011.

According to the Portland Press Herald, the boy told the Maine court: 'He went outside and he shot my mom. I was doing nothing... I was shocked when I saw him do that.'

Prosecutors said Hayden thought his estranged girlfriend and mother of his four children, 27-year-old Renee Sandora, was having an affair with Mills, Hayden's long-time friend.

Hayden's attorney told jurors that DNA from a bullet and shell casing point to someone other than his client. 

Prosecutors described Hayden as a drug addict and an extremely jealous man who would hide in the woods across from Miss Sandora's house and try to catch her cheating on him. He reportedly accused neighbors and friends of cheating with her.

The prosecution alleges that between 6.20pm and 6.40pm Hayden shot his friend Trevor Mills multiple times before firing a shot into Miss Sandora's abdomen.

Moments later the mother-of-four made a 911 call from her cellphone. She told the responder that 'her boyfriend' had just shot her.

The prosecution then alleges that the boy watched as his father shot his mother in the head at close-range.

Hayden was later arrested after being involved in a high-speed chase with police in Mr Mills' car.

The trial continues as police officers and a doctor giving information on the victims' autopsies will testify on Tuesday.
