A 25-year-old US Army private hit by a freight train because he was listening to music and didn't hear it coming has miraculously walked away from the accident virtually unscathed.

Kristopher Wenberg, a father-of-one and Unit Supply specialist for the US Army, was walking along train tracks in Topeka, Kansas, last night.

Crew members aboard the train told the Shawnee County Sheriff's Office they saw Wenberg ahead of them and announced their horn.

But Wenberg did not notice the signal.

The crew then applied the emergency brake system but there was not enough time to bring the train to a stop and Wenberg was hit.

Incredible escape: Kristopher Wenberg, 25, a Unit Supply specialist for the US army, is lucky to be alive after being hit by a freight train as he walked along a railroad

Collision: Kristopher Wenberg was hit by a freight train, similar to this one, operated by Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Corp

Trespassing: Kristopher Wenberg is now facing criminal charges, police have confirmed, because it is illegal to walk of railroads without permission

However, after the collision, the crew reported seeing Wenberg get up and walk away from the scene.

He was seen making a phone call before being picked up by a car and escorted to a hospital in Topeka, authorities told ABC News.

A statement released by the Sheriff's Office said that, incredibly, he sustained only minor injuries to his leg and shoulder.

While Wenberg could not be reached for comment, he told authorities he had headphones in his ears when the incident occurred.

Wenberg's family told ABC he was released from hospital this morning after spending the night under observation.

The freight train was operated by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Corp.

A BNSF representative would not comment on the accident, but confirmed they are investigating.

Closest of calls: Kristopher Wenberg, who has a young son,. is believed to have been hit from behind as he walked along a railroad in Topeka, Kansas

Brian J. Bartholomew, a retired conductor who worked for BNSF for over 40 years, said that he has never heard of a pedestrian being able to walk away from a collision with a freight train.

However Wenberg now faces criminal charges because it is illegal to walk on railroad tracks without permission.

Police have confirmed they plan to charge Wenberg with trespass.

Wenberg, according to his Facebook account, does Unity Suppy for the US Army and has served in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

Unit Supply specialists are responsible for supervising or performing tasks involving the general upkeep and maintenance of all Army supplies and equipment.
