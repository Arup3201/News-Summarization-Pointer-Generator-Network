The two male students, aged 9 and 12, are accused of poisoning the water on Monday. Another student notified one of his or her parents what had happened, who notified school officials, 7Online  reported.

The students go to P.S. 315 in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. It's unclear if they are students in that teacher's class.

Two elementary school students in Brooklyn, New York have been arrested after they allegedly put rat poison in a teacher's water bottle. The two male students, aged 9 and 12, are accused of poisoning the water on Monday

They are charged with attempted assault, reckless endangerment and criminal possession of a weapon (rat poison pellets).

The teacher told police she became nauseous after drinking the water. As she was ill, another student told her that two students had poisoned her bottle, the New York Post reported.

The school, also known as the School of Performing Arts, has 841 students. Teachers speak highly  of P.S. 315.

'My school is an excellent environment for learning. We are well into the 21st century and have Smart Boards, document cameras, desktops, and laptops available in all classrooms,' one teacher posted on the website Greatschools.org on Tuesday. 'This is an excellent school!'

This isn't the first time a teacher has been poisoned by students.

In England earlier this month, Emma Place was about to drink from her cup when she was told by another student it was laced with a toxic substance, according to The Sun. Two ten-year-old students poured a liquid containing bleach into her cup.
