Mountain biker Cam Zink entered the Guinness Book of World Records on Thursday.

Zink landed the world's 'longest dirt-to-dirt mountain bike backflip,' measuring 100 feet and 3 inches, at California's Mammoth Mountain Bike Park.

The daredevil hit 46 miles per hour going downhill before he completed the backflip and made a perfect landing.

Cheers and shouts were heard after the attempt, which was filmed by ESPN.

Spectacular: Cam Zink backflips over the 80ftgap at 46mph

And he's off! Mountain biker Cam Zink is seen right before he attempts the world's longest dirt-to-dirt backflip on a mountain bike

Here we go! Zink flies off the first dirt mound 

...before he is seen soaring in between the two hills 

He did it! Zink sticks the landing and coasts down the second mound 

 

Speaking to ESPN after flip, Zink said 'It's like a dream. 'I mean, just popped off, and I was like "Holy moly, I forgot how long I'd be in the air."'

'Like I still felt comfortable, but I'm like "Man, I'm just staring in the sky for like ever," but I was like "Remember, it's a long flight," and then came round and it was just smoothest,' he continued.

'It was probably the smoothest landing I've had, all the straight errors or anything, And it's crazy, like I'm almost when into like a weird of state of mind, where it's just like, "Whatever." And then now I'm like "That's what like this whole last like six months has been about.'

'It's like a dream': Zink was stunned after completing the backflip

Embrace: Zink held his fiance, Amanda Witherspoon, who held the couple's child Ayla

'I think it's just the beginning - as in I'll do a one day maybe a 150, 200, who knows,' Zink also said.

Zink's crying fiancee Amanda Witherspoon celebrated his win, telling ESPN 'He did it!' 

Witherspoon was seen holding the couple's child Ayla. 

Guinness representative Alex Angert presented Zink with a certificate and said 'Cam, welcome to the Guinness World Records Family. You are officially amazing.'

On Wednesday, Zink told ESPN the two dirt mounds were separated by 80 feet.

'My dream is that 100 feet will be like the 4-minute mile: Once one person does it, we'll see more people going bigger,' he told the sports network.
