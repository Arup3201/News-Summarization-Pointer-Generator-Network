Banned: Polish driver Damion Czarnocki (pictured) did a U-turn in the middle of the M6 Toll before driving the wrong along the motorway - because he did not have enough money to pay the charge

Most motorists avoid paying road tolls by taking alternative routes to their intended destinations.

But one Polish driver, who had only been in Britain a few days, decided to take another option - doing a U-turn at the toll booth and driving the wrong way down the busy motorway.

Reckless Damion Czarnocki, 20, turned around in the middle of the M6 before driving the wrong way because he didn’t have enough money to pay the charge, a court heard.

He was picked up by police in 
his Skoda between junctions six and seven near Brownhills, Staffordshire, on 
the morning of August 23.

Czarnocki was banned from driving after he
careered down the hard shoulder for four miles in the wrong direction 
in busy rush hour traffic.

After being pulled over, Czarnocki, 
who was driving a rental car from Manchester to a customer in the South 
of England, claimed he had ended up on the toll road by mistake and did 
not have any money to pay the £5.50 fee.

He said he realised he was going in 
the wrong direction so performed a U-turn in lanes one and two of the 
motorway as he approached the booths.

Sonia Durrant-Clarke, prosecuting, said Czarnocki then travelled in the wrong direction along the hard shoulder.

She added: 'He had only been in the country for a few days and his English was not very good.'

Czarnocki, who was living in 
Manchester, admitted a charge of dangerous driving when he appeared 
before Fenton Magistrates Court on Thursday.

He
was disqualified from driving for 12 months, ordered to take part in 80
hours of community service and pay court costs of £85.

Defending, Andrew Bennett said 'He did not want to be on that part of the road.

'He found himself near the toll booth and turned around.'
