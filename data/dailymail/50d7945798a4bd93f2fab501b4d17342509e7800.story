Davina McCall has revealed that she still attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings and will not let herself drink even one glass of wine

Davina McCall has revealed that she still attends Narcotics Anonymous meetings and will not let herself drink even one glass of wine for fear she will be unable to stop.

The presenter, who overcame a heroin addiction when she was in her twenties, still attends group support meetings in London at least once a month.

Ms McCall - who is currently presenting the second series of Channel 4 show The Jump -  said: 'I do still go to meetings because I just think that NA is brilliant - a very, very clever system,' she said.

'I've always been really nervous talking about it though, because obviously it's an anonymous thing.

'But it really does work and I've had an awful lot of support from NA over the years.

'It's sort of a misnomer that people only go when they're about to relapse or they really need help.'

She that she won't have one glass of wine because she fears she would not know when to stop, adding that she can't just have one of anything. 

She has previously revealed that her willpower ‘goes out of the window’ when she drinks.  

She began taking drugs when she was a teenager and, by her twenties, Davina, was an addict, describing heroin as her ‘drug of choice’.

Ms McCall told The Mirror that she took great comfort in talking to other people who had faced the same problems as her at the Narcotics Anonymous meetings. 

'It's not the Moonies, it's not some weird cult - it's just a place where people get help and support. I get a lot from it.'

Last year Ms McCall undertook a gruelling Sport Relief challenge earlier this year, which involved cycling, swimming and running 500 miles from Edinburgh to London in seven days.

Despite being super fit, the challenge took its toll on Davina, and viewers were alarmed when she collapsed following her swim across freezing Lake Windermere in Cumbria. 

But she showed her mettle as she battled on to complete the challenge - raising thousands of pounds in the process.
