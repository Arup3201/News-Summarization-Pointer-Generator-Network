Peyton Manning has won his fifth Associated Press NFL Most Valuable Player award in a landslide.

The Denver Broncos' record-setting quarterback, who threw for 55 touchdowns and 5,477 yards in leading the Broncos to the AFC's best record, earned 49 votes from a nationwide panel of 50 media members who regularly cover the league. New England quarterback Tom Brady got the other vote in balloting announced Saturday night.

Manning won his other MVPs with Indianapolis in 2003, '04, '08 and '09. He also was the runner-up last season to Adrian Peterson.

No one else has won more than three NFL MVP awards. He is also the first person to win MVP awards for two different teams, after his tenure with the Indianapolis Colts.

'This is a very special award,' Manning said via video message. 'I am extremely honored to have it presented by Joe Montana and Aaron Rodgers. I am humbled by this recognition and grateful to my family, Pat Bowlen, John Elway, John Fox and the entire Denver Bronco organization, and of course, my coaches and my teammates.'

Manning's father Archie and his son Marshall accepted the award in person on his behalf.

Manning still trails several Hall of Famers for total MVPs in their sport. Wayne Gretzky won nine NHL MVPs, Barry Bonds owns seven in baseball, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar won six in the NBA.

Manning, while the victor, didn't get everyone's vote. Former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim Miller, who works for Sirius XFM radio, said he voted for Tom Brady of the New England Patriots, reported The Denver Post.Â 

Dan Pompei of websites SportsonEarth and Bleacher Report though Manning was entirely deserving of the award.

'It wasn't a very difficult vote ...In fact, it should be unanimous,' said Pompei.
