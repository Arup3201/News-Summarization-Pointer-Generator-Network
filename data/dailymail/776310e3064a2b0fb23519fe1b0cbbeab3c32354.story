A Dutch artist has fashioned a human skull out of cocaine by moulding the street-sourced class A drug mixed with gelatin.

The piece, entitled Ecce Animal, is the work of mysterious artist Diddo who says he was commissioned to make the artwork, although is prohibited from disclosing further details.

Diddo says he did not personally test the cocaine but employed a laboratory to analyse the drug bought from a street dealer.

They found it was between 15 per cent to 20 per cent pure and had been cut with caffeine, paracetamol and sugar.

Heads up: The life-like sculpture is claimed to be moulded using a street-sourced class-A drug

Mystery: The artist who created the unusual sculpture refuses to say who commissioned it

Binding agreement: Gelatin was used to bind the drug powder together

Ecce Animal is a comment on the juxtaposition of man's animal instincts versus the relatively comfortable modern world we live in.

Diddo, 36, explains: 'Ecce Animal is not intended to be parable on the self-destructiveness of addiction or substance abuse. Instead, it's the focal point for a thought process.

'I don't want to over-intellectualise, but it's the fusion of two icons (skull and cocaine) that provokes thought and discussion on the nature of man. Specifically, about his creation of, and participation in, a society which echoes his own tendency to lose control.

Concept: The artist describes his work as the fusion of two icons - a skull and cocaine

Off his head? Diddo hopes his work becomes a focal point for discussion on the nature of man

Diddo claims his artwork confronts the notion that man has created a society that's out of control

'We have temporarily outgrown the intended uses for our animal instincts. This leaves us in an uncomfortable conundrum. Where can we safely store them until we need them again?'

Diddo studied Media Design at the School of Arts Utrecht, NL and acquired a Masters Degree in European Media Design from the University of Portsmouth, UK in 2001.
