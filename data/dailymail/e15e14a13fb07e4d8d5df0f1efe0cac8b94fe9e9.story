 Limited edition holiday drinks have become a festive tradition and with new additions from Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, it looks like the trend is set to continue for years to come.

But, as FEMAIL can reveal, many of the tasty treats currently on offer at your favorite coffee chains contain seriously unhealthy levels of fat and sugar. One festive beverage, a large Eggnogg Latte from Peet's Coffee and Tea, contains a whopping 700 calories, more than one third of your recommended daily intake.

Even a small cup of the calorific beverage, which is made with a special 'eggnog milk', contains 450 calories, more than most of the other coffee chain's large portions.

The sweetest treat of them all: Peet's large Eggnog Latte contains a whopping 700 calories, however the company's large Cinnamon Hazelnut Latte (pictured) offers a more modest 385

It's nearly here! Starbucks announced the arrival of the Chestnut Praline Latte (pictured) - its first new holiday drink in five years - last month but are making customers wait until November 12 to try it

Thankfully, it seems the full fat offering is the only one of its kind on the menu; the company's other popular holiday drink, the Cinnamon Hazelnut Latte, offers a relatively modest helping of calories, with a small cup containing just 240.

Then there are Starbucks' festive selections. Last month the coffee chain chain announced that it would be launching the Chestnut Praline Latte, the first new addition to its holiday menu in five years, which is due to arrive in stores on November 12.

According to Bloomberg, the hotly-anticipated drink took nearly three years to create, with Starbucks eager to ensure the perfect blend of espresso, steamed milk, caramelized chestnut flavor, spices - and a rather unhealthy helping of sugar.

A few lucky customers had the opportunity to test the drink when Starbucks released it on trial in a few select locations in November last year and the majority were thrilled with the results. 

'Trying out the new Chesnut Praline flavor...and it's a winner!' one person posted on Instagram, while another added: 'Holy moly, the #Starbucks chestnut praline latte may be my new favorite holiday beverage!'

A Starbucks spokesperson told FoxNews.com that the new drink is 'inspired by the time-honored holiday tradition of warm roasted chestnuts… with freshly steamed milk and flavors of caramelized chestnuts and spices'.

But while the taste tests are proving positive, the drink's nutritional information reveals a whole other side to the festive treat. 

Each small Chestnut Praline Latte contains an impressive 270 calories,  while a large size contains approximately 420.

And Starbucks' new seasonal offering faces some serious competition. Enter Dunkin' Donuts new festive menu, which features two new beverages, the Snickerdoodle Cookie Latte and the Sugar Cookie Latte.
