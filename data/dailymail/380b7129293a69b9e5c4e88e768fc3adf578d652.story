Authorities in Paris are investigating the disappearance of a North Korean student amid fears he may have been forcibly taken back to the secretive nation to be executed.

The man, identified only by his surname Han, has ties to Kim Jong-un's uncle, Jang Song-thaek, the regime's former second in command who was executed for treason last December.

Inspectors arrived at the prestigious Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Architecture de Paris-La Villette last week in search of the architecture student, but were told he had not been seen for 15 days.

Jang Song-thaek, Kim's uncle and mentor was purged last December after being accused of a coup. Han is reported to have links to Jang, as his father was one of Jang's advisors

A source said Han had been picked up by North Korean agents sent to the school, before being driven to Charles de Gaulle airport, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.

According to reports he managed to escape his captors, but it is not clear whether he was recaptured or whether he is still hiding somewhere in France.

Han is the son of one of Jang Song-thaek's closest aides. His father is known to have been 'purged' recently as Kim attempts to reassert his authority after disappearing himself this summer.

Han had been studying at the French school since 2011 along with nine other students who were invited to join by the French government.

It was initially reported that the other nine students had also gone missing, but they have now reappeared according to Le Parisien.

As with most western nations, North Korea has no official ties with Paris, but maintains a small delegation to deal with limited economic negotiations.

However, what few relations the two nations do have risk being damaged further if it transpires Han is being sheltered by French authorities.

Jang, Kim Jong-un's mentor, second in command, and uncle, was executed for treason last December after being accused of planning a coup.

Since Jang was executed last December Kim has rounded up hundreds of his supporters and relatives. Han's father, a close aide of Jang, is known to have been purged recently

In a statement at the time, Pyongyang called Jang Song Thaek a 'traitor to the nation for all ages,' 'worse than a dog' and 'despicable human scum'. 

Since then, potentially hundreds of supporters and relatives have been rounded up and either executed or sent to labour camps as Kim has sought to wipe the Jang family out.

There were thoughts that Kim could have been deposed himself this summer after he was pictured limping at a state event, before going missing for several weeks.

However he was soon back in the spotlight and officials said he had gone missing in order to have a cyst removed from his ankle.

This week Kim was pictured visiting an air base at an undisclosed location in North Korea to offer 'field guidance' to soldiers there. 

He was also pictured being cheered on by crowds of workers on a visit to a fishery.
