New York City is bracing itself for more snow with 10 more inches forecast to be dumped during a winter storm sweeping across the country as 106 million Americans prepare for blizzard conditions.

Treacherous travel conditions and flight delays are expected, with the heaviest snowfall due to collide with the Monday afternoon commute.

Temperatures are predicted to drop as low as 15 degrees on Monday and the snow is likely to fall thick and fast, with some predictions of it coming down at a rate of 2in an hour.

The storm will start with a light dusting of snow on Sunday afternoon, which will become thicker and heavier as the arctic storm that has been sweeping across the U.S. reaches the East coast.

'It may be difficult to shovel and plow due to its weight,' Accu­Wea­ther’s Alex Sosnowski told the New York Post.

He added that the timing also makes it likely that the storm will cause 'major disruptions'.

The cross-country storm will dump snow over more than 1,500 miles, including more than 6 inches along the Ohio River south of the I-70 corridor from Kansas City, MO. to St. Louis, to Cincinnati and Washington D.C.

Some places may record more than a foot of snow.

The snow and ice will also impact areas between the I-90 and I-40 corridors in the Plains and the Midwest as well as the I-80 and I-85 corridors in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic, AccuWeather reports.

The Midwest has seen a new record for number of days with subzero temperatures this year. International Falls, Minn., has seen 70 days below zero, the most since 1978, while Grand Forks, N.D., has logged 70, the fourth most number on record and shy of first places by a mere 4 days.

More than 57in of snow have already fallen this winter in Central Park, making the season the seventh-snowiest since records began.

The worst on record was 1995-96, but if more than 6in of snow falls in this storm, 2013-14 will break the record.

The constant icy conditions and blizzards has led to a surge in last-minute vacations being booked as residents seek a reprieve.

Heavy: New York, which has already had 57in of snow this season, could have a further 10in

Freezing: Streets are cleared after a snow storm last month. City workers are warned of difficult traveling conditions on Monday

The number of winter sun vacations booked in New York has risen by 20 percent in the past month, according to Richard Beck, of ClassicTravel.com.

'They are pretty desperate ... They feel like they gotta get out of here,' he said.

The storm is predicted to move on by Tuesday, although temperatures for that day are currently predicted to be 14 degrees.

Constant snowstorms this season have grounded thousands of flights, disrupted business and contributed to more than $1 billion in insured losses across the U.S. as heavy accumulations collapsed roofs, according to Bloomberg.

Trapped: The snow will be difficult to shovel or plow because of its weight

Keeping busy: The harsh winter has disrupted businesses but it also provided seasonal work for about 1,800 snow shovelers

While some businesses have suffered during the winter, the heavy snowfall has provided jobs for more than 1,800 unemployed people

A Sanitation Program has an army of snow shovelers, who earn up to $12 an hour by keeping the sidewalks free from the white stuff.

'I wish it could keep snowing every day so I don’t have to look for another job,' Nadji Colon, an unemployed barber who found work with the seasonal program, told the New York Times.

Mr Colan and the other Emergency Snow Laborers look set to be busy again at the start of the week.
