Hull's one-club half-back Richard Horne has announced he will retire at the end of the season.

The 32-year-old has been with his hometown side all of his playing life, having made his debut aged 16.

Since then he has racked up 383 appearances for the Black and Whites, including a victorious Challenge Cup Final in 2005.

Horne has earned Dream Team recognition in that time, while also making 12 appearances for Great Britain.

'It has probably taken about two to three months to allow me to get my head around the idea, but it just feels the right time to retire from playing,' said Horne, who will remain at the KC Stadium as an academy coach.

'If somebody had told me when I made my debut for the club back when I was just 16 that I would still be playing for Hull at 32, I would have laughed and then quickly snapped their hand off for the opportunity. For me to be able to live my childhood dream, what more could you ask for?'

The latter part of Horne's career had to be tailored after he was diagnosed with diabetes, while he also came back from a career-threatening neck injury in 2008. 

'It has been an amazing 16 years, unfortunately though at some point you have to make this decision and it just feels like the moment has come for me,' he added.

'The decision has coincided with the club offering me this role within the coaching staff, which I am extremely looking forward to and I'm glad I am able to stay with Hull to take up this new challenge.

'Hopefully I will be able to have an equally long coaching career at the club as I have managed to achieve playing.'
