John Terry has claimed he and Branislav Ivanovic were 'double headlocked from every corner' during Chelsea's draw with Manchester United on Sunday.

During the first half of the game at Old Trafford, which finished 1-1, Marcos Rojo appeared to wrestle Terry to the ground while Chris Smalling had hold off Ivanovic as United defended a corner. 

Pictures clearly show the United defenders grabbing their Chelsea counterparts around the neck but referee Phil Dowd failed to spot the infringements.

And on Monday, Terry wrote on Instagram: '#JTandIVAgotdoubleheadlockedfromeverycorner'.

Sportsmail's Graham Poll said Chelsea 'deserved' a penalty for at least one of the holds and labelled Smalling's grabbing of Ivanovic as the 'more blatant' of the incidents.

Speaking on Sky Sports after the game, Jamie Carragher added: 'You could argue it should be two penalties. It’s not just Chris Smalling on Ivanovic, you’ve got Rojo on Terry. The two have virtually got them in headlocks. 

'From Dowd’s position he should see this. You can tell by Ivanovic’s reaction; he’s not just appealing — he’s going berserk. The Manchester United ones are worse than Shawcross (versus Swansea) last week.' 

Sky Sports reviewed the incident at half-time and show both Terry and Ivanovic being held in the box

United saved a point in the 94th minute through Robin van Persie after Didier Drogba had put Chelsea ahead. 

As well as expressing his anger at United's defensive tactics, Terry also revealed his frustration at Chelsea's inability to leave Old Trafford with three points. 

He wrote: 'Great goal from @didierdrogba today, Frustrated not to come away with 3 points. Great performance and it shows how well we are playing when you come away from Old Trafford disappointed with 1 point. Thanks to all the travelling fans for your great support.'

The draw leaves Jose Mourinho's side four points clear at the top of the table, while United are 10 points further back in eighth with 13 points.
