Police out on patrol in Mexico came across a big problem when they were called out to help round up a hippopotamus.

The beast was spotted wandering aimlessly through the streets of Tlajomulco de Zunigaa, in the central state of Jalisco.

It was apparently with a man who said he kept the animal at his home was not too far away.

The man told police the animal wandered off into the streets when he let it out of its cage for a walk in the park.

After some coaxing, police surrounded the hippo and guided it into a cage.

Officers then arrested the man, who didn't have the documentation to prove he was the owner.
