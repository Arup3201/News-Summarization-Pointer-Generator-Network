The former lover of accused serial killer Darren Vann has opened up for the first time about the horrific night he poured a can of gasoline over her, threatening to burn them both alive and take an apartment block down with them.

After a decade of terrified silence, Ceritha Grant, 43, finally feels free to tell her story after Vann's arrest in connection with the murder of seven women around Gary, Indiana.

And she revealed Vann came looking for her less than a week before he is accused of strangling prostitute Afrika Hardy in a motel room, leaving her in the bathtub with the water running.

Nightmare: Ceritha Grant, 43, finally feels free to tell her story after Darren Vann's arrest in connection with the murder of seven women around Gary, Indiana.

Monster: Darren Deon Vann  is the 43-year-old man in custody for the suspected murders of seven women in Gary, Indiana. Ceritha Grant narrowly escaped death at the hands of the accused murderer

'He went to my mother's house hoping to find me there. I don't dare think what he was going to do,' Ceritha said as she sat down exclusively with MailOnline.

'I know he is capable of doing exactly what he is charged with — I went through it,' she added.

Vann, a former Marine, has now been charged with Hardy's murder last Friday at the Motel 6 in Hammond, Indiana. Authorities expect to charge him with three other killings this week and he is the sole suspect in three more murders after a weekend in which he led police to women's bodies in several abandoned buildings in Gary.

Cops in both Indiana and Texas believe that Vann, 43, could be linked to more killings, possibly going back 20 years.

Vann charmed Ceritha with his intellect when they first met as neighbors on Madison Street in Gary in 2003. 'He was very smart,' she said. 'His idea of a night out was to go to Barnes and Noble and read books, mostly science fiction or Harry Potter.

'All he wanted to do was read and watch movies. He was very clean living, he didn't smoke, didn't drink and he didn't take drugs.'

But behind the clean-cut façade was a monster who frequently kept her locked in the house, refused to let her have friends and even hogtied her in her own mother's home, she said.

'I couldn't leave him. When we were together he would hold on to me so tight I couldn't get away. When he went to work he would often lock me in the house.'

Ceritha's terror came to a head in early April 2004 after they had been together for nine months and she realized she had finally had enough of her boyfriend's controlling ways. Vann went looking for her, believing she was seeing her wheelchair-bound friend David Abram, who had been paralyzed below the waist in a shooting.

'He had absolutely nothing to be jealous about,' she said. 'David couldn’t have had sex with me even if we had wanted to. He was just a very dear friend.'

Vann twice went round to Abram's apartment threatening him. The third time, he returned with a red, plastic gasoline can, claiming he also had dynamite and was going to blow them all up unless he could find Ceritha, who, he claimed, owed him $7,000.

According to a police report of the incident acquired by MailOnline, Abram asked him 'You're going to burn my family — innocent people — over a woman?' Coldhearted Vann replied: 'Give me $7,000 and you can have her.'

Within minutes, Ceritha turned up on the scene and Abram threw her his keys. She ran into the apartment, locked the door and hid under the bed.

Infuriated, Vann kicked in the door and started pouring the gas on the floor, saying if she didn't come out from her hiding place he would burn the place down, the police report states.

Ceritha crawled out from beneath the bed as the fumes from the gasoline got stronger. Her ex-lover grabbed her and put her in a headlock, she recalled.

Authorities say Darren Vann confessed to Hardy's slaying

'He got what was left of the gasoline and poured it over me,' Ceritha told MailOnline. 'I was drenched in gasoline from my shoulders down. Then he tipped the rest of it over his own head. All of this was in full view of the police.'

'He was flicking the lighter threatening to burn me alive, to set fire to us all,' she exclaimed.

'Police got everyone out of the apartment block. There was 12 or 16 apartments there. If he had lit the gasoline the whole place would have gone up.'

By this time police had arrived at the now-demolished apartment complex on Gary's VanBuren Street, but as Vann gripped his ex, he told them to back off or he would set the whole place on fire.

'Vann pulled this woman out of the home by force with his left arm around her neck while he was holding a lighter in his right hand along with the gas can,' the police report states. 'He refused to let the woman go after she asked him several times.'

Despite being charged with a felony, Vann only served 90 days in prison. 

April 6, 2004 was just the culmination of Vann's cruel ways, Ceritha told MailOnline. Some three months earlier they had visited her mother on East 7th Avenue. 'He hogtied me and duct taped my mouth shut so I couldn't scream — that was in my mother's own house!

'Another time he locked me in our apartment for a whole week. It was like a jail, the only time I saw him was when he brought me my three meals a day.

'By that stage of the relationship I realized I had to get out, but I couldn't because he would threaten my mother. He said he would kill me, he would kill my mother.'

To make his point, Vann marched Ceritha to a desolate spot in the down-at-heel town. 'He said he could easily make me disappear here. It was just because I wouldn't have sex with him that night.'

Ceritha was then finally able to make her escape from his clutches and went into hiding.

Ceritha admits she knew that Vann was already married when she moved in with him. His ex-wife Maria is 29 years older than him and now lives in Texas.

'He told me he only married her because he hated being alone. I didn't know her but she would come around occasionally and bring him food. She didn't stay with him.'

Bizarre coincidence: Ceritha's husband Jacobbie Landers  told MailOnline that unbeknownst to him he once employed his wife's former lover in his repair shop in Gary, just five blocks from where Vann threatened to set the apartment block on fire. Landers has since relocated the business to East Chicago.

Vann was jailed for five years in Texas between 2008 and 2013 for aggravated sexual assault. After his release he returned to Indiana where he registered as a sex offender and began again to look for Ceritha who is now happily married and living in East Chicago, Indiana, a few miles northwest of Gary.

'He always said he was going to get me and to the day he was arrested he was looking for me,' she said.

'Of course I am relieved he has been arrested, but I worry about what his friends or his family could still do.'

Ceritha's husband Jacobbie Landers, 47, told MailOnline that unknown to him he once employed his wife's former lover in his repair shop in Gary, just five blocks from where Vann threatened to set the apartment block on fire. He has since relocated the business to East Chicago.

'Of course I knew of the time with Ceritha and the gasoline,' he said. 'But it wasn't until my brother saw his picture on the television after his arrest that we realized he worked with us for a time.

'We fix stoves and refrigerators and household items and I liked to hire people from the neighborhood rather than bring people into Gary. He only worked for us for a couple of months, but he was a pretty good worker.

'I didn't know he was the man that tried to kill my future wife.

'Now I can't help wondering if my wife is the one woman who got away from this man.'
