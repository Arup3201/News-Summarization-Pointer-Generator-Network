Criticised: John Bercow came under fire last night over the £7million plan for classrooms in Parliament

Speaker John Bercow came under fire last night over a £7million plan for classrooms in Parliament.

He is backing plans for a new education centre dubbed ‘Bercow’s Folly’ to encourage thousands more schoolchildren to visit the Commons.

But the centre, earmarked for land next to the Palace of Westminster overlooking the Thames, will cost £1 million a year to run on top of the £7million building costs.

And some MPs say the scheme cannot be justified while taxpayers are still tightening their belts.

Tory MP Jake Berry, parliamentary aide to Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps, said: ‘Squandering this amount of taxpayers’ money on classrooms is outrageous.

'At a time when Parliament itself is reducing its running costs, it is beyond belief.’

The Speaker last night hit back, with officials saying the education centre idea has already been ‘unanimously’ backed by key MPs. 

The row erupted after the Commons finance committee – meeting behind closed doors – was shown detailed plans for the education centre. 

MPs heard it involved building a classroom complex next to the House of Lords, complete with a new security entrance.

It would be a temporary structure because the entire Palace could be refurbished in 10 years’ time and the centre might need to be relocated.

The aim is to more than double the current 45,000-a-year visits to Parliament by schoolchildren and students.

But three Tory MPs present at the finance meeting asked to be recorded as opposing the plan.

Concern: MPs Jake Berry, left, and Barry Sheerman, right, have questioned whether the project is justified

The Mail on Sunday understands that 
they thought it was a ‘nice idea’ – but also argued it was inappropriate
when Parliament itself was cutting its budget.

The
MPs have declined to comment but Mr Berry, who is not a member of the 
finance committee, openly said the project should be ditched.

Labour MP Barry Sheerman, former chairman of the Commons education committee, also questioned whether it was justified.

He said: ‘I support improving facilities for schoolchildren. But when services to MPs themselves are being cut back, we have to review going ahead with this scheme.’

Last night, a spokesman for Mr Bercow said the principle of creating a dedicated education centre had already been ‘unanimously approved’ by the ruling House of Commons Commission.

He said the plan would allow an extra 55,000 young people a year to visit Parliament. 

The spokesman said: ‘Involving and enthusing young people in this way is key to addressing currently low levels of democratic engagement.’

The row comes after Mr Bercow enraged Tory MPs last week by rebuking David Cameron after he called Ed Miliband ‘a conman’ at Prime Minister’s Questions.

However, other MPs insist Mr Bercow was right to rule that Mr Cameron’s ‘conman’ jibe was unparliamentary.
