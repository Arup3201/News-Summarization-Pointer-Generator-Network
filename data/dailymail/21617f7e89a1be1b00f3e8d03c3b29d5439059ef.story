Ann Summers has been given a high fashion makeover by the acclaimed British designer Giles Deacon.

The collaboration is a first for Ann Summers, as the brand attempts to extend its offering and widen its appeal to take on other high street lingerie brands.

The underwear giant describes the new range as 'unapologetically sexy and bold with a dash of naughtiness.'

It's here! Giles Deacon's lingerie range for Ann Summers has been unveiled and describes itself as 'unapologetically sexy' (corset, £145)

Giles Deacon, who worked for Bottega Veneta and Gucci before founding his own label, GILES, in 2003, once said that he 'didn’t design for wallflowers' and this mantra is certainly in evidence in this collection.

The Giles 
Deacon for Ann Summers SS14 collection is made up of four key lingerie and erotic ranges and fashion-forward 'sexcessories', including rose gold necklace and cuffs, lace eye 
masks and feather ticklers.

Key pieces have multifunctional detailing - straps that double up as hand cuffs, for example.

It's not for the shy! Giles once said that he 'didn't design for wallflowers' and his mantra has been injected into this collection of baby doll lace dresses (£60) and more daring underwear

Flattering: Giles said he knew he wanted to combine great shapes and thoughtful details into the 'affordable range'

Taking everything into account: Giles said he considered different aspects of a woman's personalities - whether that's flirtation, dominance or playfulness - when designing the range, which lands on May 1

Speaking about the range, which launches in-store and online on May 1, Giles said:  'Ann Summers is an iconic brand recognised and loved by so many and which occupies a unique and successful position on the British high street.

'I knew at the start when designing the collection that I wanted it to combine great shapes, thoughtful details and to be of the highest quality that would enable the pieces to be aspirational yet affordable.

'I also thought about different women who might be buying these pieces when designing the collection, with different aspects to their personalities whether that’s flirtation, dominance or playfulness - the finished collection enables them to pick and choose and have some fun with all of the ranges as a collection of lingerie that can be the foundation for any outfit or occasion.'

A spokesperson for Ann Summers, said: 'Giles’ collections are sexy yet always have a sense of fun, values that are in line with the Ann Summers brand - as a designer he is not afraid to be daring or to take risks, which is important.

'We're so excited to launch this collection to our customers.'
