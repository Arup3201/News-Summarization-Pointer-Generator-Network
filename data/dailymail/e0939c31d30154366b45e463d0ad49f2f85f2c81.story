Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon, was buried at sea today with a full military service.

The ashes of the ‘reluctant’ icon of the 1960s Space Race were transported on the guided missile cruiser USS Philippine Sea and were committed to the Atlantic Ocean.

Yesterday, Armstrong was praised in a memorial service at the National Cathedral as a humble hero who led mankind into space.

In an immensely moving moment, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Paul Nagy and Armstrong's wife Carol, committed the remains of Neil Armstrong to sea while members of the ceremonial U.S. Navy guard offered a final salute.

After the ceremony, Mrs Armstrong accepted an American flag from the captain folded 13 times. It is always given to family members of the deceased following the service.

Armstrong flew in nearly 80 combat missions for the Navy during the Korean War before joining forces with NASA.

The ceremony was in accordance with Navy burial procedures, NBC News reported, and included remarks from Navy chaplain Donald Troast, and three volleys of ammunition were set off by a firing squad.

In addition, Taps was played while family members and sailors looked on.

NASA didn't give the location of the private ceremony. However, the ship's home port is located in Mayport, Florida.

Armstrong, who died on August 25 from heart surgery complications, made it clear that he wished to be buried at sea, though because of his stature, he could have had a memorial in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington.

As commander of the Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969.

The legendary astronaut was born on August 5, 1930, near Wapakoneta, Ohio.

He went on to work in the military, fighting in the Korean War. Later, he would pilot planes for NASA, and eventually, spacecrafts.

During the historic mission on July 20, 1969, nearly half a billion people tuned in to watch the black and white mission to the moon, where Armstrong, joined by Edwin ‘Buzz’ Aldrin, spent some two hours loping around on the eerie grey surface.

He radioed back to Earth the historic news of 'one giant leap for mankind.'

'The sights were simply magnificent, beyond any visual experience that I had ever been exposed to,' Armstrong once said.

The moonwalk marked America's victory in the Cold War space race that began October 4, 1957, with the launch of the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, a 184-pound satellite that sent shock waves around the world.

Although he had been a Navy fighter pilot, a test pilot for NASA's forerunner and an astronaut, Armstrong never allowed himself to be caught up in the celebrity and glamor of the space program.

'I am, and ever will be, a white socks, pocket protector, nerdy engineer,' he said in February 2000 in one of his rare public appearances. 'And I take a substantial amount of pride in the accomplishments of my profession.'

However, his Apollo 11 moon mission turned out to be Armstrong's last space flight.

The following year he was appointed to a desk job, being named NASA's deputy associate administrator for aeronautics in the office of advanced research and technology.

He left NASA a year later to become a professor of engineering at the University of Cincinnati.

Mourners who packed the vast cathedral to mark Armstrong's death last month heard him described as embodying the best of American values and a dedicated pilot

Yesterday, mourners packed the vast National Cathedral in Washington, D.C.to mark Armstrong's death last month.

They heard him described as 
embodying the best of American values and a dedicated pilot who shunned 
the limelight after the historic moon landing in 1969.

'He
embodied all that is good and all that is great about America. Neil, 
wherever you are, you again have shown us a way to the stars.'

-Last man on the moon Eugene Cernan

'He
embodied all that is good and all that is great about America. Neil, 
wherever you are, you again have shown us a way to the stars,' Eugene 
Cernan, the last man on the moon as the commander of the 1972 Apollo 17 
mission, said in a tribute from the pulpit.

'As you soar through the heavens where even eagles dare not go, you can now truly put out your hand and touch the face of God.'

The
service included the Navy hymn Eternal Father Strong To Save and the 
Frank Sinatra standard Fly Me To The Moon performed by Grammy-winning 
jazz performer Diana Krall.

'Fly
me to the moon, let me swing among those stars, let me see what spring 
is like, on Jupiter and Mars,' Krall sang as she accompanied herself on a
piano.

Armstrong, who died last month in Ohio at age 82, walked on the moon in July 1969.

'He's
now slipped the bonds of Earth once again, but what a legacy he left,' 
former Treasury Secretary John Snow told the gathering.

Apollo
11 crewmates Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins and Mercury astronaut John
Glenn and about two dozen members of Congress were among the estimated 
1,500 people in the cavernous cathedral.

A moon rock that the Apollo 11 astronauts gave the church in 1974 is embedded in one of its stained glass windows.

NASA administrator Charles Bolden, a former astronaut, said Armstrong's humility and courage 'lifted him above the stars'.

Bolden
read a letter from President Barack Obama saying, 'the imprint he left 
on the surface of the moon is matched only by the extraordinary mark he 
left on ordinary Americans'.
