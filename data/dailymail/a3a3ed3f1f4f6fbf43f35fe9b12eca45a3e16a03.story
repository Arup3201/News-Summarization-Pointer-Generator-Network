Hamilton Accies will charge fans just 10p per person to get into this weekend’s Scottish Premiership match against Inverness as a tribute to departed duo Alex Neil and Frankie McAvoy.

Accies will be the second top-flight club to try an innovative scheme to boost attendances this winter, with Inverness trialling a pay-what-you-want scheme for Tuesday’s home clash with St Johnstone.

Neil has taken over at English Championship side Norwich City and Accies assistant McAvoy will join him after Saturday’s visit of Caley Thistle to New Douglas Park.

Hamilton vice-chairman Ronnie Macdonald came up with the idea of ‘The Perfect 10s’ tribute this weekend, as Neil graced Hamilton’s No 10 jersey with distinction as a player, while both he and McAvoy were at the Lanarkshire club for 10 years.

Macdonald told Sportsmail: ‘Our fans put up banners saying goodbye and good luck to Alex during our recent match against Dundee United - and the club wanted to honour them, too.

‘I think too often in football, people leave football clubs under a cloud - even after doing very well.

‘But we could not be happier that Alex and Frankie’s great success and great football with Hamilton has resulted in them getting this opportunity at Norwich.

‘This club is all about wanting the very best for its employers and when they move on to better things we are delighted.

‘And with it being Frankie’s last game on Saturday, we thought there was no better time to do this tribute, by letting fans, home and away, in for just 10p.

‘It’s not about how many fans come through the gates, though. If anyone looks they will see that our crowds have been going up and we do a lot of work behind the scenes to connect with the local community.

‘This is about paying tribute to two men who gave this club so much and to show the esteem in which they are held at New Douglas Park.

‘We look forward to welcoming all our loyal supporters, and perhaps even some new ones as well, to send Frankie - and Alex - off in style with the acclaim they deserve,’ added Macdonald, who hopes that Neil’s successor will be in place within seven days.
