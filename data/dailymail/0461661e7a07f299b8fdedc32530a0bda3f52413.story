Drivers using their cellphones at the wheel does not affect the number of crashes, according to the results of a recent study. 

Researchers at the University of Colorado looked at more than a million accidents over six years on highways in California and found that a state ban had not reduced the number of collisions.

The researchers chose a window of six months before and after the ban to eliminate other factors such as the production of safer cars, the recession and changes in other  traffic laws.

The results appears to contradict previous research which suggests using a phone at the wheel is as dangerous as drink-driving.

Thirteen states currently ban handheld-cellphone use for all drivers, and 10 other states have some form of ban either just for younger drivers, a ban in school zones or as a local option. 

The findings published in the journal, Transportation Research, said: 'We find no evidence of a state-wide decrease in accidents as a result of the ban. While our results are specific to California, cell phone bans in other jurisdictions that have similar enforcement and penalty parameters could be expected to have similar effects.'  

University of Colorado associate economics professor Daniel Kaffine, one of the study's authors, said: 'If it’s really that dangerous, and if even just a fraction of people stop using their phones, we would expect to find some decrease in accidents. But we didn’t find any statistical evidence of a reduction.'

'Disentangling these effects will be useful for policymakers in other states who are considering policies to address distracted driving,' Kaffine added. 'However, our results suggest that simply banning hand-held cellphone use may not produce the desired increase in traffic safety.'

However, Kaffine said it is not conclusive proof the laws do not work, pointing out that some people may have already switched to handsfree devices such as Bluetooth before the ban.

Crashes related to distractions caused by cellphones are said to be one of the most common causes of deaths among young people.
