It was billed as a night of 'decadence, debauchery and indulgence.'

But students who attended an Oxford University May ball described a 'catastrophe' after guests suffered burns from the hog roast, the entertainment failed to show and the food and drink ran out in a matter of hours.

The aptly-named The Last Ball was arranged by a joint committee from Somerville and Jesus Colleges and charged £150 a ticket with around 1,000 people thought to have attended.

'Decadence': The Last Ball for Oxford University students had promised to be an extravagant event but turned out to be a farce

Their ambitious plans had already caused a stir when it emerged they included hosting a live shark in a tank at the event.

But this feature had to be cancelled after the committee was inundated with complaints.

Since the event, furious students 
have set up a Facebook group to vent their anger at the 'farce' and 
demand an explanation from the organisers.

One alumni ticket holder told Oxford University magazine Cherwell he felt 'monumentally ripped off'.

It described 'a "violent scrum" for food, misleading advertising and 'unprecedented prices' criticised by students and alumni.'

Guests reported that there was only one stall serving a hog roast and the vegetarian halloumi option ran out early.

One Jesus student told Cherwell this meant 'many were stuck with only lettuce wraps for the whole night'. 

The long queues prompted other ball-goers to push forward forcing those at the front close to the roast.

Students posted pictures on the Facebook page of burnt skin and dresses. One described the melee as a 'violent scrum'.

Two acts who had appeared on advertising, Clean Bandit and Cancun Kid, failed to perform although they had given notice and attendees were notified via the ball's Facebook page.

But other elements of the entertainment were also criticised. One ball-goer described the indoor maze as 'disappointingly short' claiming it only lasted 'three minutes'.

Another student described how she was prevented from going to bed by overzealous security guards.

'I'm a Somerville student and felt ill at about 2am on the night of the ball. Being cold, hungry and having drunk a fair bit I asked to be allowed to go to bed. I spoke to security and a member of the ball committee and when I wasn't allowed to go to bed I burst into tears and explained that I was feeling ill and suffer from depression. I needed sleep but was instead sent to the first aid room,' she wrote.

Some of the ball organisers posted a letter apologising for their failures and denying charges of embezzlement. They blamed their failings on their inexperience and the small numbers of committee members.
