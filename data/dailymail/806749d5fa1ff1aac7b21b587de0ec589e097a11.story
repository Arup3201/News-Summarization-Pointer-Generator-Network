A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her vision of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity.

Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy.

Ms Krasojevic is an avid supporter of renewable energy - previously designing an electric coral reef station and a hydroelectric prison.

A London-based architect has been making waves in the design industry with her design of a stunning home powered by hydroelectricity. Margot Krasojevic's concept, Hydroelectric Tidal House, aims to harness the consistent and powerful movement of waves to generate energy

She explained that the construction will be focused around two shells - one inner and one outer.

Made of concrete, the outer shell is designed to keep the house stable and will use solar cells to generate energy for the living section.

The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. The section will float within the external structure as the tide rushes through it.

As tides are more predictable than solar energy, Ms Krasojevic has included a two-part turbine, which, reacting with waves, will compress air to create an electrical current - similar to a wind turbine.

Ms Krasojevic, 39, said: 'Designers approached me to design a surfers' beach house, which made me think of tidal power and using this dynamic in a similar way to how surfers choreograph movement through water.' Pictured is the exterior staircase of the home

The second part of the turbine uses magnets that move along a copper wire, also generating electrical energy.

Ms Krasojevic, 39, said: 'The hydroelectric house is the latest in my design approach, attempting to harness renewable energy within sustainable design.

Coral reefs are known as the ‘rainforests of the sea’ and although they only occupy a total area half the size of France, they provide a home for a quarter of all marine species on the planet.

Now Margot Krasojevic has shared designs for a futuristic manmade reef with an electric field designed to attract calcium carbonate from the water in a bid to form new reefs quickly.

In her vision, the reef would be formed from a framework of moveable steel girders and steel ball structures, designed in a way to support the growth of natural coral.

Large ‘metal balls’ would be connected by cables to floating solar panels on the water’s surface so an electrical current can be generated.The current would draw particles of calcium to small pieces of natural coral attached to steel frames below the water, in a bid to stimulate further growth.

It would be low enough for divers to swim around the structure - which looks as it if comes from a sci-fi film – but strong enough to create an electric field around the frame.

The field would condense dissolved calcium carbonate in the seawater so that it could attach itself to the steel frame in order to build the limestone skeleton. And the coral fragments tied to the calcium carbonate-covered frame would help limestone skeleton growth, which is the foundation for natural corals.

The inner section, which will be made of aluminium, will move in cohesion with the tide. That movement will run a turbine which will then generate electricity for living

'I believe it is vital for architects to work with cross disciplines - in particular, planning infrastructure and sustainability' 

Earlier this year, Ms Krasojevic unveiled a design for champagne bar that will be the toast of Paris if it is built before the French capital is threatened by another flood.

Located on the banks of the Seine, the ultramodern structure – dubbed Grand Cru du Siecle – would have an enclosed circular glass bar situated over a bell mouth spillway that swallows water and sends it into underground canals.

According to Ms Krasojevic's splashy proposal, the water is then diverted into outlying lakes and reservoirs.

As for the bar itself, it features a monocoque shell that welcomes natural light and etched glass like that of a bottle of bubbly.
