Poignant: The diamond encrusted brooch that prisoner Katarzyna Krauze managed to hide in the Gulag

A gold brooch a World War Two prisoner stitched into her cardigan seam to hide it from her captors has emerged on the Antiques Roadshow.

The precious heirloom was sewn into the lining by Polish woman Katarzyna Krauze asshe and her family were forced out of their home by the invading Russian army in 1939.

While interned at the labour camp in Siberia where her husband died of pneumonia, Ms Krauze had all her possessions taken from her - except for her cardigan.

After the Russians changed sides in the war Katarzyna and her 18-year-old daughter Irena were released and they eventually fled to England via Palestine.

It was only after the war when she moved to south London that she felt it was safe enough to unstitch the star-shaped brooch from its hiding place.

The piece of jewellery has been treasured by the family and handed down through the generations.

Victoria Wilson, her great-granddaughter, took it along to the Antiques Roadshow in Surrey to show experts and reveal the lucky star's remarkable story.

Victoria, a 31-year-old HR manager from Guildford, said: 'The brooch is the only item left of my family's life in Poland. They lost everything apart from this brooch.

'It clearly meant a great deal to my great-grandmother as it was the only piece of jewellery she saved. She deliberately stitched it into a tatty old cardigan thinking that none of her guards would want it.'

Priceless: Ms Wilson says she is hoping to pass on the brooch to her daughter Esme as a piece of family and world history

'It is a priceless heirloom that I keep locked in a safe and only wear for very special occasions.'

It is believed that Victoria's great-great-great grandmother acquired the white gold brooch in the late 18th or early 19th century and handed it down through the family.

Days after the Germans invaded Poland from the west, the Russian Red Army moved in from the east and commandeered the Krauzes' home in eastern Poland.

Katarzyna, her husband Stanislaw, son Walter and 18-year-old daughter Irena, were later arrested by the Russians, wrongly accused of spying and throw into a gulag.

The family were separated and the mother and daughter never saw Stanislaw again.

Victoria said: 'The Russians gave my great-grandparents a few hours to pack up some possessions and move put of their home.

'My great-grandmother took a heavy cardigan and in the lining of it she sewed this brooch.

'During their time in captivity she and my grandmother moved from camp to camp and all their possessions were stolen from them.

'But even with all the searches and the de-lousing that went on, the brooch survived in the cardigan.'

After the two women were released from the gulag in December 1941 they travelled by cattle train to Persia where Irena joined the Polish army as a nurse.

In June 1944 they were evacuated to England and Irena worked in a military hospital.

She added: 'The brooch remained in the cardigan the whole time.

'My great-grandmother died in 1953 and it was given to my grandmother. She kept it in her jewellery box but never wore it because it was too precious to lose.

'My grandmother is still alive but had two sons and so she has given it to me. I am keeping it in a safe but will wear it for very special occasions.

Detail: Antiques Roadshow expert John Benjamin believes the number 56 indicated a Russian-made jewel

'I took it along to the Antiques Roadshow because I wanted to find out a bit more about where it originally came from."

John Benjamin, the expert from the show, believes the brooch to be Russian.

He said: 'I don't think we can really appreciate the brutality of those times. The survival is extraordinary.

'It transcends value. It is a piece that connects us with that extraordinary past, and it's a privilege to handle it.'

Victoria said she intends to one day pass the brooch on to her daughter Esme, who is aged two.

The item will feature on the Antiques Roadshow this Sunday.
