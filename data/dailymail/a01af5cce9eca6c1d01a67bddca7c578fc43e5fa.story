Kate tried her hand at table tennis while Harry joined the basketball court and William took to the football pitch

Her husband and his brother are the sportsmen of the family. But yesterday the Duchess of Cambridge beat them both hands down.

While Prince William’s shot at goal on the football pitch was wildly inaccurate and Prince Harry missed all four basketball hoops he attempted, Kate picked up a table tennis bat and showed the menfolk exactly how it was done.

She was described as ‘unbelievably talented’ by a coach – despite playing in heels – while trying her hand at the sport as the three young royals attended the launch of a project in South-East London that aims to train the next generation of sports coaches.

Hidden talents: Onlookers said Kate was a 'dab hand' at the sport as she ably took on an opponent from the club

Known for her sporting prowess, Kate recently impressed members of the British hockey team too when she took to the pitch to show off her dribbling skills

On the football pitch William 
sweated in the heat as he kicked a ball, dribbled it through some cones 
and then wildly mis-timed a shot at goal.

Prince Harry missed his four shots at goal in the
basketball but Kate looked calm and she played table tennis.

Kate looked the picture of summer 
perfect in a patterned white and beige Hobbs summer dress, low beige 
wedges and with her trademark blowdry.

Kate's 'Wessex' dress cost £35 in the sale from High
Street store Hobbs but is sold out.

Later on she 
changed into more appropriate wear – a white polo shirt and slender blue
 trousers – to join William and Harry again to welcome the Olympic flame
 at Buckingham Palace.

The Duke was joined by Michael de 
Giorgio, chief executive of Greenhouse, and chatted to some of the 
coaches who were taking the lessons.

But William could not resist joining in and lined up with a group of youngsters for shooting practice.

The royal shimmied through some cones 
then passed the ball to a trainer who returned it for the shot, but 
William hit it just wide of an empty goal.

With
 his head bowed he trudged back to the middle of the pitch but a few 
minutes later had the chance to redeem himself when the students were 
asked to volley the ball into the net.

As William ran forward the trainer 
threw the ball into the air and shouted 'keep your eyes on it' but the 
royal sent it just over the bar but received the encouraging comment 
'much better' from the coach.

In a short speech about Coach Core 
William jokingly likened himself to being a 'giraffe on ice skates' on 
the football pitch and ribbed his brother Harry about 'cheating' to 
become the fastest man on earth -  a reference to his legendary race 
against Usain Bolt in Jamaica earlier this year'.

But he charmingly described his wife, Catherine, as being ' a sight to behold with a tennis or hockey stick in her hand'.

The
 Coach Core programme is being piloted by the organisation Greenhouse 
and will train 16 to 19-year-olds to become qualified coaches and 
mentors for their schools and communities.

The
 hope is that the talented young sportsmen and women will be able to 
inspire their students and build a future for themselves in sport.

Forget your kit, Kate? She may not have the right attire, but a very game Duchess of Cambridge attempts to dribble a football wearing her Pied-a-Terre wedged espadrilles 

If
 it proves successful, the foundation aims to roll out the initiative to
 other sectors where inspirational young coaches can become role models 
for and inspire young people.

'The
 Royal Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry 
wanted to develop a sports programme in recognition of London hosting 
the Olympic Games and developed the Coach Core concept with Greenhouse 
charity,' a spokesman for the three said.

William made a speech and thanked 
John Martin, the Headteacher, the staff and pupils of Bacon's College 
for hosting the event and giving himself, Kate and Harry such a warm 
welcome.

'Over the next 
month, the eyes of the world will be on Great Britain. For us to hold 
the Olympic and the Paralympic Games here in London is a great moment 
for our Nation, which itself is steeped in sporting history. 

'Therefore,
 for Catherine, Harry and me there could be no better way of starting 
this epic time than being with you here in Rotherhithe, so close to the 
heart of London 2012, to launch Coach Core,' he said.

The young Royal told of how important coaching is within the sports field.

He
 said: 'Coaching is a vital part of any sport.  Being properly coached, 
really knowing about your sport – how to play it, how to train for it, 
how to compete - allows you to enjoy it to the full and gain most value 
from it.  Being properly coached is also the key to success, over the 
next few weeks we just need to look over the river to see the power of 
coaching.   ‬‪‬

The Duchess of Cambridge tried her hand at judging a judo match - but stopped short of actually joining in with the contact sport

'Coach Core will offer 16 to 22 year olds the 
opportunity to become first class coaches, taught and mentored by 
professionals in their field and in turn passing these skills on to 
other young people.  Once this year’s pilot scheme is successfully 
completed, we hope over the next few years to train hundreds, then 
thousands, of young people to become coaches -  and in time, transform 
the sporting potential, aspiration and enjoyment of many thousands more 
across this Country.‬‪

'A 
special thank you to all those here today who have already signed up for
 the project. Catherine, Harry and I wish you every success in your new 
careers as sports coaches.‬‪'

William and his brother were dressed 
equally casually - well, for male royals - in open neck shirts and 
chinos.

Harry sported a distinctive patterned African belt and brown 
suede shoes. He walked onto the five-a-side football pitch where dozens 
of school 
children were practising shooting, dribbling and passing skills, and 
made two attempts on goal after running through a series of plastic 
cones.

He
 put the first shot 6ft wide and the second over the top of the bar. He 
later joked with one girl: 'Obviously it was the shoes.'

William and Harry asked a group of about a dozen boys and girls which team they supported. Many answered Arsenal or Chelsea. 
One boy told William he supported the duke's favourite team, Aston 
Villa, to which William replied: 'Good man, good man.' Another boy said 
Xavi, the Barcelona and Spain midfielder, was the best in the world. 
William said: 'He is good, isn't he.'

Forget the forecast, we Britons only truly know it’s summer when the 
Duchess of Cambridge swaps her trusty LK Bennett Sledges for a pair of 
Pied-a-Terre wedges - and today she appeared in her summer favourites - 
the purse-friendly Imperia (£80).

A dressed-down Kate, William and Harry appeared at Bacon’s College in 
South-East London today to launch an initiative to help young 
sportspeople become coaches.

Clad in a customised grey Hobbs 'Wessex' 
dress (you can pick one up for £35 in the sale at John Lewis), Kate 
looked every inch the frugalista. Until, that is, you reach her 
immaculately glossy and luxuriously expensive-looking blowdry which 
stayed perfectly in place and completely frizz-free as she played a 
quick game of table tennis and refereed a judo match. 

Heatwave? What heatwave? When it comes to chic summer style, Kate takes gold.
