At work he is a big man in a small world and is now celebrating 50 years of model effort.

Craftsman David Ellis has racked up more than half a century creating the miniatures at the celebrated Babbacombe Model village in Torquay, Devon, since it opened in April 1963.

He works as part of the team designing, making and maintaining the famous miniaturised versions of British life.

A big man: David Ellis (pictured) is the craftsman who has created all the miniatures at Babbacombe Model village in Torquay, Devon, since it opened in April 1963

Then and now: Mr Ellis working on a house he built in the 1970s and (right) today still crafting buildings as beautifully as ever

New addition: David stands next to a version of the Shard at the model village, one of the latest structures added to its version of the British skyline

Day job: The 65-year-old trims a thatched roof and works as part of the team designing, making and maintaining the miniaturised versions of British life

In fact the 65-year-old is the longest serving member of staff and is still going strong.

And he still enjoys it, saying: 'Every day is different.

'Techniques have changed from when I started.

'We use more fibre glass than wood now.

'But it's still about making accurate scaled models and that's where the skill is.'

Bygone era: David (circled) among other staff in 1984. He is still going after all these years and is the longest-serving worker

Back then: This archive picture shows the newly developed site one week before it opened in April 1963

Pretty as a picture: This is another view of Babbacombe Model Village in Torquay, Devon, showing how its creators wanted to distil the essence of English life in miniature form

Bird's eye view: Visitors snake their way into Babbacombe Model Village, which has become one of Devon's most popular attractions

The first model he made in 1963 was a model railway track.

But his favourite is the thatched cottages of the Mockington exhibit - a miniature version of local scenic village Cockington.

He said: 'I had to learn how to thatch to do it from a local master thatcher.'

Magic: The modeller stands at the heart of the village's own version of Stonehenge with its own tiny pagans

Big effort: David Ellis has been at the centre of the village's creation, which contains 13,000 little men, women and children

Skilled: David using a plane inside the workshop using skills he picked up from master craftsmen to produce his scale models

Everything is 1/12th scale and there are more than 400 models including hamlets and harbours  -  as well as sound-effects of cows mooing, church bells ringing and even little loos flushing for the 13,000 tiny people.

The 'village' was born 40 years ago when Thomas Dobbins, who trained as an architect, decided to recreate the quintessential English rural community.

The settlement has since grown in area, if not in scale, into a miniature district with an assortment of architectural styles, farms, businesses, working watermills and railways  -  and even a lake stocked with koi carp.
