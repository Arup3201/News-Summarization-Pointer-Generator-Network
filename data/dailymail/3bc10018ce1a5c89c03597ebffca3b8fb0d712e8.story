It is often dismissed as part and parcel of growing up. But being picked on by your brother or sister can create deep mental scars, experts have warned.

A study found that those who were regularly bullied by a sibling when a child were more likely to be clinically depressed or take an overdose in their late teens.

The British researchers said that bullying at home is a ‘hidden problem’ – and one that victims find hard to escape.

They said parents must be aware that the phenomenon isn’t confined to the playground.

Some 3,500 children aged 12 were asked if they had been bullied by sibling and, if so, how often it happened.

Bullying involved more than simple teasing. The definition included deliberate nasty and hurtful remarks and being ignored and ostracised, as well as being kicked and pushed and being the subject of rumours and lies.

Six years later, aged 18, the same youngsters answered questions about their feelings. They were also asked if they had ever self-harmed by taking an overdose or cutting themselves.

Almost 800 said they had been bullied several times a week when young. These young men and women were twice as likely as those to be clinically depressed as young adults as those who hadn’t been tormented by a sibling.

They were also twice as likely to say they had self-harmed within the previous year compared with those who had not been bullied.

If the figures were extrapolated, sibling bullying could account for 13 per cent of depression and 19 per cent of self-harm among 18-year-olds, the journal Pediatrics reports.

The study also found girls more likely to be victims than boys – with big brothers often the perpetrators.

Lead author Dr Lucy Bowes, from the University of Oxford, said: ‘Forms of bullying where victims are shoved around the playground or targeted at work have been well documented, however, this study uncovers a largely hidden form of bullying.

‘Victims of sibling bullying are offered little escape as sibling relationships endure throughout development.

‘We are not talking about the sort of teasing that often goes on within families, but incidents that occur several times a week, in which victims are ignored by their brothers or sisters, or are subjected to verbal or physical violence.’

Co-author Professor Dieter Wolke, of the University of Warwick, said: ‘It is important that parents set clear rules about what is allowed in conflicts and they should intervene consistently when their children maltreat each other repeatedly.’

Emma Jane Cross, chief executive of charity BeatBullying said: ‘Being bullied as a child can have a devastating effect which lasts a lifetime.

‘Parents who are concerned about this issue should speak to their children as early as possible before the problem escalates.

‘It's important to tackle the underlying issues behind more frequent bullying behaviour rather than dismissing it as normal sibling rivalry.’
