Police are hunting for four suspected armed bank robbers who crashed their getaway car in Fairfield East  and fled on foot before attempting to hijack two vehicles.

Police received a call suggesting the men were at a house on Hercules Street, in Sydney's south-west, and placed four nearby streets into lockdown in a major police operation, following two armed robberies at a bank in nearby Chester Hill and a golf club in Auburn earlier on Friday morning.

Two men were armed with firearms, one was armed with a hammer and a fourth man acted as the getaway driver, police said.

A police chase took place after they fled the golf course in a blue Holden station wagon.

The getaway car crashed head-on into another vehicle before it was abandoned with the doors open on the corner of Tangerine and Normanby Streets in Fairfield East.

The men then attempted to hijack two vehicles but were unsuccessful.

On Friday afternoon police wound down the operation after failing to locate the men, but Chief Superintendent Peter Gillam issued a warning to the bandits.

'It does not end here,' Chief Supt Gillam said.

'Police will do everything in their power to apprehend them, to put them before a court and to get an arrest.'

Police helicopters were also used to hunt for the four men, who 

Chief Supt Gillam said police believe they're still armed and members of the public have been urged not to approach them.

NSW State Crime Command has now taken over the investigation. 

At 10.35am police were called to a hold-up  at the Commonwealth Bank branch on Waldron Road in Chester Hill.

Men dressed in 'all black' double-parked outside the Commonwealth Bank branch and were in the premises for 'a minute and a half', witnesses told Nine News.

A pregnant woman was in the bank at the time and was 'very very shaken and emotional' following the ordeal, the ABC reported. 

The bank's security screens were triggered and it is unclear if the robbers were able to steal any money.

A NSW police spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia witnesses were treated for shock by ambulances at the scene but no one was injured.

Police also responded to an armed robbery at a golf club on the corner of Weymouth Avenue and Chisholm Road in neighbouring suburb Auburn at about 10.45am.

Staff at Rosnay Golf Club told police three men – two armed with firearms and one with a hammer – threatened staff demanding money.

Crime scenes have been established at both locations and investigations are currently underway.

Police do not have descriptions of the men because they were wearing balaclavas.
