German Chancellor Angela Merkel has enlisted a heavyweight companion to fight alongside her in next year's general election - God.

A day after scrapping an unpopular medical charge and boosting benefits for stay-at-home mothers, Mrs Merkel has taken a leaf out of Tony Blair's book to declare that she has strong religious beliefs.

It is the first time that the former Lutheran minister's daughter, a cool-headed physicist who was raised in former Communist East Germany, has admitted that faith is a vital part of her life.

While cynics claim her declaration is aimed at hard-core conservatives in her Christian Democratic Union party, she said: 'I am a member of the evangelical church. I believe in God and religion is also my constant companion, and has been for the whole of my life.'

Mrs Merkel was on answering questions from a theology student on an Internet blog when she revealed her views on religion.

She continued: 'We as Christians should above all not be afraid of standing up for our beliefs.

'The structure of the world relating to belief is a framework for my life that I consider very important.'

Popularity issue: Some believe Merkel is fishing for votes from Germany's Christian community

Volker Resing, her biographer, said: 'She has realised that her avowal of Christianity is important - as a signal within the secular society, but also to her party members who have often accused her of not being concerned with the C in the party's initials CDU.'

Some critics suggested that the chancellor may be 'fishing' for votes from the declining Christian community in Germany.

Tens of thousands in particular have 
left the Catholic church because of the child sex abuse scandal which 
they feel has not been properly addressed by the pope.

But
 at least one newspaper said that her statement was aimed partially at 
the three million Muslims in Germany, saying that her nation is, at 
heart, Christian and always will be and that her religion is as 
important to her as theirs is to them.

She
 is an opponent of Turkish entry into the EU primarily because it is a 
Muslim nation and the EU a largely Christian grouping of states.
