Maddison Murphy-West was found dead on October 23, 2013, at her home in Melbourne

A year since 20-year-old Maddison Murphy-West’s body was found at her home police now believe a killer could have covered up her murder to make it look like she had committed suicide.

Homicide detectives believe that Maddison’s body could have been disguised as self harm, which is what her family have believed to be the case all along, and are seeking advice on whether murder charges should be laid.

Detectives are preparing a brief of evidence to present to the Office of Public Prosecutions, the Herald Sun reports.

On October 23, 2013, the day of her death, Maddy's young son Noah was found alone inside her Pakenham home, in Melbourne. He is now living with Maddison’s mother, Paula 

A spokesperson for Victoria Police told Daily Mail Australia: ‘The investigation is ongoing and homicide detectives have been in liaison with Maddison’s family. It is not appropriate to comment at this time.’ 

Alarmingly, Maddison had been treated in hospital for an assault 13-months before her death and her family believe she was often in fear for her life.

Paula said that in 2012 marks were found on Maddison's neck but the young mother dismissed someone had tried to choke her and claimed it was ‘play-fighting’.

Police believe the crime scene was tampered with after her death, something her relatives have also previously claimed. 

They also say money was withdrawn from her account after her death. 

Maddison has been described as a doting young mother. Her son Noah was found nearby inside her  home, on the day of her death

Her mother Paula said when police knocked on her door she knew that Maddison was dead before they even spoke.

'I said, "What's he done to her? What's he done to her?",’ Paula told the Herald Sun. 

Maddison has been described by friends as ‘cheerful’ and a ‘go-getter’

Friend Meaghan Vander Ree said Maddison was an amazing mother and that she had lived with her boyfriend and their son in their Ahern Road home for three years. 

Since Maddy’s death, her friends and family have continued to campaign for justice.

In March, Maddy’s high school friends held a rally to raise money for her two-year-old son Noah.

Over $5000 was raised on the day, with the proceeds being donated to a trust fund for Noah’s education.

Maddy's friends and family have continued to campaign for justice since her death 12 months ago 

Maddy’s friend Oakley Hansen told the Berwick News on the day: ‘We were in the same boat, we both had young children.

‘My daughter’s just a little bit younger than Noah so we always had that in common which is always something that brought us closer.

‘We were both young mums trying to raise our kids the right way and we just got along really well.’ 

Paula was also at the rally and said she was overwhelmed by the support the community had shown. 

‘It’s hard to put it into words; I'm still in a bit of shock with everything anyway. Something like this shows how much support’s out there,’ Paula said. 

A Facebook page full of photos to remember Maddy has also been created. 

‘On the 23/10/2013 we not only lost our good friend but a beautiful daughter and mother You will always be forever in our hearts, We will all cherish our memories with you forever. Rest In Peace Baby Untill we meet again, [sic]’ it reads.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Maddison's family for comment.
