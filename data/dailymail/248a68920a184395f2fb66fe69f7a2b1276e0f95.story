A renowned artist has been given a 
restraining order after he stalked one of his life models for four years
 – telling police ‘you should never give up on love’.

Walter
 Kershaw, 73, a street artist known as ‘the original Banksy’ admitted 
harassing Catharine Mitchell, 43, and her mother Marjorie, 69.

Kershaw
 followed Miss Mitchell around the local supermarket, drove past her 
home blowing kisses, and regularly turned up at her mother’s house to 
ask about her.

Never give up on love? Artist Walter Kershaw, left, 73, was convicted of harassment at Bury Magistrates' Court and ordered to keep away from his ex-lover Catherine Mitchell, right, 43, after stalking her for four years

He also put 
an oil portrait of Miss Mitchell in the window of his art gallery in 
Littleborough, near Rochdale, Greater Manchester.

Kershaw,
 a father of two, became famous in the 1970s for his large-scale murals.
 He appeared on radio and television, and his fans included Bob 
Monkhouse and George Best.

He
 met Miss Mitchell in 2006, when she asked him to paint her in the nude.
 They went on to have a relationship, and he painted three portraits of 
her.

But Bury Magistrates’ Court heard that Miss Mitchell broke up with 
Kershaw the following year, after she was hit by a motorbike and 
suffered life-threatening brain and leg injuries in a collision outside 
his gallery.

Andrew Hey, 
prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant did not have any contact with her 
during the recuperations. She was happy about this and thought he would 
move on but he did begin to drive past her house on a regular basis.

‘She
 also says he would wait at the end of the street as they were entering 
church each Sunday and they would bump into each other in the 
supermarket. He would  follow her around the aisles and say she looked 
beautiful.

Mr Hey told the 
court: ‘In police interview Mr Kershaw talked of the old English 
expression that you should never give up on love but said he had no idea
 he was affecting them in this way.’

The
 unwanted attention frightened Miss Mitchell and police gave her a panic
 alarm. In January 2009 police spoke to Kershaw and warned him not to 
contact Miss Mitchell. The following March harassment orders were issued
 banning Kershaw from contacting Miss Mitchell or her mother.

But
 in January this year a friend of Miss Mitchell reported him to police 
for harassment on her behalf. In August he once again approached Miss 
Mitchell, this time as she sat alone in her car, and he was eventually 
arrested.

He appeared before
 magistrates this week where he admitted  harassment and was given a 
restraining order which bans him from contacting Miss Mitchell and her 
mother for two years.

He was also told to pay the women £250 each in compensation and banned from displaying any kind of image of either victim.

Kershaw is celebrated for his distinctive murals like this, The Inside Out House, painted in Rochdale in 1976

In
 a statement, Miss Mitchell said she believed Kershaw was ‘capable of 
anything’. She added: ‘I worry for my own safety. I want him to stop so I
 can live my life in peace.’

Her mother said: ‘We have taken taxis to 
avoid him, plodded across muddy fields and dodged aisle to aisle in the 
supermarket.’

Paul Kidd, 
defending, said: ‘This was a relationship he [Kershaw] felt was carrying
 on and she felt it wasn’t.

'He has pursued it when he shouldn’t have and
 he apologises to both for any distress caused.’
