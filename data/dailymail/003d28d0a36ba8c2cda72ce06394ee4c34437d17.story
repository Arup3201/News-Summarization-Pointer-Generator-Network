High School parents were left outraged after watching a drama teacher’s awards ceremony, which contained swearing, a box of sex toys being presented as a prize and a joke about a paedophile priest.

One parent who witnessed the event at Bellingham High School in Whatcom County, Washington State, described how it left her opened mouthed in shock.

The backlash against the teacher, Teri Grimes, was so fierce that she was forced to issue a formal apology.

The upset mother vented her anger about Sunday's ceremony in the school hall, which she attended with her 17-year-old daughter, in an email to KOMO News.

She said: ‘I sat there with my mouth open in shock and the final straw was when a joke was told on stage about a teacher, a lawyer and a priest on a plane.

‘The plane was going down and the teacher says we have to save the children. The attorney says "f*** the children!" and the priest says "oooh… Do we have time for that???"'

The parent, who walked out mid-way 
through, added that the ceremony also contained awards for ‘horniest 
stud’ and ‘horniest girl’, for which the prize was what appeared to be a
 box of sex toys.

A statement from Grimes, who has been a teacher for 30 years, said: ‘I deeply apologize for some very inappropriate comments and actions made during our drama students' end-of-the-year awards ceremony.

‘This is not representative of our students who take such great pride in their school and respect one another. Much of the evening was a great celebration of their work.

‘However, as a teacher and the club's leader, I take full responsibility and am extremely sorry.'

However, one former pupil defended her, 
saying she had ‘a fun, outgoing personality’ and ‘people make mistakes, 
hers just happened to be public’.

Bellingham High School Principal Jeff Vaughn wrote a message on the school website in which he described the controversy as a learning curve.

It said: 'We met with our drama club advisor and students to discuss the very inappropriate behavior by some members of the club that occurred during their awards ceremony on Sunday evening.

'This has generated media coverage and has been a learning opportunity for our teens regarding the harm that can come from offensive comments and jokes.'
