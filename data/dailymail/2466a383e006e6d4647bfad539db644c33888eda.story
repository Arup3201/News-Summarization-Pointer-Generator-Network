Sen. Rand Paul shared a photo of himself receiving a booster vaccine Tuesday online, after his comments about childhood vaccinations Monday made waves and were picked up by news outlets.

The photo shows Paul (R-KY) with his shirt sleeve rolled up and a needle in his right arm.

The tweet that accompanied the image read 'Ironic: Today I am getting my booster vaccine. Wonder how the liberal media will misreport this?'

Medical treatment: Sen. Rand Paul posted this photo of him receiving a booster shot to Twitter on Tuesday

Paul made the trip with New York Times reporter Jeremy W. Peters, who also posted a snap of Paul receiving his booster.

Peters tweeted 'In which @SenRandPaul and I go to the doctor; he gets vaccinated. "I think everybody should vaccinate their kids."'

According to Peters' report in The New York Times, while at the doctor's office Paul said 'It just annoys me that I'm being characterized as someone who's against vaccines.'

Paul continued 'There's 400 headlines now that say "Paul says vaccines cause mental disorders." That’s not what I said. I said I've heard of people who've had vaccines and they see a temporal association and they believe that.'

The newspaper reported that the senator and opthalmologist's booster was for Hepatitis A.

On Monday, Paul said in an interview with radio personality Laura Ingraham 'What happens if you have somebody not wanting to take the smallpox vaccine and it ruins it for everybody else? I think there are times in which there can be some rules, but for the first part it ought to be voluntary.'

Remarks: Paul, seen on Tuesday in Washington, D.C., said Monday ''I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines' 

During a Monday appearance on CNBC's 'Closing Bell,' when pressed about his remarks by Kelly Evans, Paul said 'Here's the thing. The thing is I think vaccines are one of the greatest medical breakthroughs that we have. I'm a big fan and a great fan of the history of the development of the smallpox vaccine for example.

'But you know, for most of our history, they have been voluntary. So I don't think I'm arguing for anything out of the ordinary. We are arguing for what most of history has had.'

Later in the interview, Paul told Evans 'I have heard of many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.

'I'm not arguing vaccines are a bad a idea. I think they are a good thing, but I think the parent should have some input. The state doesn't own your children. Parents own the children. And it is an issue of freedom and public health.'

Paul released a statement Tuesday, in which he backed vaccines. 

'I did not say vaccines caused disorders, just that they were temporally related—I did not allege causation,' the statement said. 'I support vaccines, I receive them myself and I had all of my children vaccinated. In fact, today I received the booster shot for the vaccines I got when I went to Guatemala last year.'
