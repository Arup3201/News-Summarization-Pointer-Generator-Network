Three leading gyms have been forced to give their 1.4million members fairer and cheaper  cancellation rights.

LA Fitness, Dave Whelan Sports and the Harlands Group will change the smallprint in contracts to make it easier to quit without being hit with punishing penalty charges.

The move follows pressure from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) and concern that some members were being charged fees of more than £500 to pull out.

Locked in? If you are no longer able to go to the gym it may be easier now to cancel your contract

Bannatyne Fitness, which is owned by 
the Dragons’ Den star Duncan Bannatyne, David Lloyd Leisure and Fitness 
First, were required to end the same rip-off earlier this year.

Fears
were raised after many contracts carried clauses that locked members 
into long-term deals of up to 24 months and made it difficult to quit.

Those
who suffer an injury, fall ill, lose their job or has to move for work 
reasons can be hit with a cancellation bill equivalent to a full year of
payments.

The new contracts, agreed with the OFT, give members extended rights to cancel their contracts early with a small penalty.

Sales staff will also have to spell out more clearly the length of the initial contract period and the cancellation rights.

The OFT is now writing to 20 other fitness operators warning them to ensure membership contracts are fair and clear.

Cavendish
Elithorn, OFT Executive Director, said: 'As a result of our 
investigation, millions of eligible gym members now have better contract
terms, including improved cancellation rights that prevent them being 
unfairly locked in if their circumstances change.

‘This
should be a warning to the rest of the industry that we will not 
hesitate to take action where we find evidence of consumers being 
treated unfairly.’

Getting in shape: The changes follow an OFT investigation into the gym industry

He added that anyone who is considering joining a gym or health club should read the terms of the contract carefully before signing.

‘Alarm bells should ring if gyms are not being clear and upfront about their terms and conditions, including the length of the contract and cancellation rights,’ he said. ‘If consumers are told something that is not in the terms and conditions, they should ask for written confirmation.'

The OFT said it would continue to monitor compliance alongside Trading Standards.

It launched its investigation after a High Court ruling against a gym management company found lengthy membership periods could be unfair when they locked people in without adequate cancellation rights if their circumstances changed.

Gillian Guy, chief executive at national charity Citizens Advice said: 'There is just no excuse for dodgy gyms locking customers into unreasonable contracts. We helped with over 3,000 problems with gyms and health clubs over the last year. We regularly hear from customers who have been ripped off by deals that have a nasty surprise in the fine print.

'Gyms need to be up front with their customers about what is involved in their membership contracts. Those gyms that still haven’t done so should follow the example of those giving better cancellation rights or risk a consumer backlash.'

1. How long is the contract? Carefully
consider the length of the contract and whether you are sure you want 
to sign up for a year or whether a rolling monthly contract or 
pay-as-you go would be more suitable. Membership costing £50 a month 
will add up to £600 a year.

2. Can you cancel the contract early if your circumstances change or if you change your mind? Find
out if you can cancel the contract if your circumstances change. Some 
gym providers allow you to cancel the contract or put it on hold under 
certain circumstances such as if you are injured and unable to use the 
facilities or if you lose your job.

If the salesperson makes verbal 
promises such as 'you can cancel your membership at any time', ask them 
where this is set out in their terms and conditions or, if it is not, to
confirm the point in writing before you sign up.

3. Ask if the gym has a cooling-off period.
Normally you can't cancel if you change your mind or stop using the gym
and will have to pay every month until you can cancel at the end of the
minimum term.4. Will the contract be automatically extended after the initial membership period? Most contracts for gym membership automatically continue once the initial membership period has expired.

Make a note of the date by which you should inform them. You
should ask for some form of proof that the gym has received your 
cancellation notice. For example, if you hand it in at the gym reception
desk, get a receipt.5. Do you have the time to go to the gym and can you afford the monthly payments? Make
sure you understand the commitment you are signing up for and that you 
are sure the contract you have signed up for suits your needs.
