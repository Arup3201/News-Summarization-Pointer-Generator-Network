The sister of OJ Simpson's murdered wife Nicole blasted the serial killer who claimed he carried out the slaying as a sick fame-seeker.

Glen Rogers, who was convicted of killing two women in 1995, is on death row in Florida. He reportedly confessed to the brutal stabbings of Nicole and her friend Ron Goldman.

But Denise Brown told Mail Online: 'I don't know of Glen Rogers but from what I've heard he's not famous and wants to be. My thoughts are he should have come forward years ago if fame is what he's seeking.'

'Sick': Denise Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, said Glen Rogers' 'confession' is nothing more than a publicity stunt

'I think it's the biggest bunch of crap I've heard in a while and I've heard a lot,' she added.

Denise, who now gives lectures across the country to raise funds for women's shelters, was speaking after Ronald's father, Fred Goldman, also dismissed the so-called confession. He remains adamant that Simpson killed his son.

The new theory about the infamous 1994 murders, floated by filmmakers for Investigation Discovery, marks only the second time an alternate suspect has been suggested.

The nine-month trial of millionaire OJ Simpson, defended by some of the top attorneys in the nation, remains the most explosive court case in modern American history.

The acquittal of Simpson on the murder charges is still a deeply divisive topic.

Investigation
 Discovery, an offshoot of the Discovery Channel, reports that Rogers 
boasted that he befriended Nicole shortly after he moved to Los Angeles 
from Ohio.

He is said to have bragged about partying with her and, more ominously, warning that she was rich and he was ‘going to take her down’.

The New York Post reports that Rogers confessed to the crime years after he was already jailed for the murders of the two other women, even giving police a few receipts as evidence that he was in the area at the time of the double-homicide in June 1994.

The documentary explains that the reason why Rogers’ name has never come up before is because Simpson was purposefully keeping his connection to Rogers under wraps.

Rogers, who at one point boasted about having killed up to 70 women in a cross-country serial spree, alleges that Simpson hired him to break into his ex wife’s home to steal a pair of $20,000 earrings.

Adding up: A new documentary bases the connection of Rogers to the Simpson case largely on his own confession

Timeline: Rogers said that he was hired by OJ to steal expensive earrings from Nicole's home and he gave him permission to kill 'that b****' if necessary

He also says that while the original intention of the partnership was to get the earrings, Simpson gave Rogers permission to kill ‘the b****’ if necessary.

Fred Goldman has campaigned to keep his son Ron, 25, from being forgotten as only Nicole Brown Simpson's friend.

He has not given any thought to the suggestion that someone other than OJ maybe have been responsible for the murders.

'OJ Simpson murdered Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. The criminal trial showed overwhelming and monumental evidence that OJ Simpson was the killer. There was no contrary evidence other than guess, innuendo, and rumor,' he told TMZ.

Mr Goldman says he believes Investigation Discovery is playing up Rogers' alleged confession to boost the ratings of the show.

The documentary does not feature Rogers himself, who is serving time on death row in Florida, but it comes close to home as it is based largely on interviews with his brother Clay who was the person to tip police off to Glen’s whereabouts.

'Gimmick': Fred Goldman, the father of murder victim Ron Goldman, says he still believes OJ killed his son

Murdered: Ron Goldman, 25, an aspiring actor, was found stabbed to death, along with Nicole Brown Simpsons

Glen allegedly told Clay about the 
Brown-Goldman murder but he did not believe it. Later on, Glen spoke to a
 criminal investigator and went through step-by-step details of how the 
murder took place.

Rogers is suspected of being a prolific murderer who used his charm and good looks to pick up women at bars.

He is currently on death row in Florida for the 1995 murder of Tina Marie Cribbs in Tampa. He and Cribbs reportedly had sex at a motel after meeting at a bar. He then stabbed her multiple times and left her to bleed to death in the bathtub.

He was later convicted of murdering Sandra Gallagher, a mother of three, in Los Angeles in 1995, as well. Her body was found in her burning pickup truck.

He is also suspected in the deaths of women in Mississippi and Louisiana.

California authorities suspect he was behind four other murders in that state, as well.

At one point, Rogers boasted her murdered 70 people, though later recanted and said he was only joking.

The truth behind the murders of Nicole
 Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman has gotten murkier, not clearer in the 17
 years since OJ's acquittal. 

The timeline of the crime has long 
been a point of contention as OJ infamously signed a deal to pen a book 
called ‘If I Did It’ which was ultimately cancelled.

Numerous friends and acquittance have 
come forward, claiming firsthand or secondhand knowledge of OJ 
confessing to the crime. However, the former football star and actor has
 publicly maintained his innocence.

Despite being found not guilty at the 
criminal trial, the families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman 
sued OJ in civil court.

Several pieces of evidence were introduced that had been excluded from the criminal case. The jury found Simpson legally liable for the wrongful deaths of the two victims. Their families were awarded more than $33million in damages.

Earlier this year, private investigator William Dear floated a theory that OJ's son Jason Simpson committed the murders.

In a book, Mr Dear claimed that OJ stood trial to deflect attention away from his son, who he says was mentally unstable at the time.

The theory has been called 'absolutely absurd' by some legal analysts.

One of the key witnesses in the case, Kato Kaelin, a small-time actor who testified for several days at the trial, has flipped-and-flopped back and forth on whether he believes Simpson committed the crimes.

Most recently, he said he had no direct knowledge of Simpson admitting to the crimes.

Simpson is now serving 33 years in prison for a recent armed robbery in Las Vegas.

In 2007, two sports memorabilia dealers say Simpson and four other men reportedly broke into their hotel room and robbed them at gunpoint.

Simpson denies that he used weapons and claims he was only taking back property that was rightfully his from his days as a college football and NFL star.
