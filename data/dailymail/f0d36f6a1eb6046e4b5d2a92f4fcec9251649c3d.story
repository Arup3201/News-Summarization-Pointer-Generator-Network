Google Glass may be a groundbreaking product that opens up a new frontier in computing.

However, there is one fact it hasn't yet got away from - you look like an idiot using them.

One firm hopes to change that by creating smart specs that look fashionable.

The Icis glasses will sell for $420, and the firm behind them is raising money via Indiegogo, claiming their design is 'fashion first'

The Icis glasses will sell for $420, and the firm behind them is raising money via Indiegogo.

It takes aim squarely at Google, even through the search giant recently launched a range of designer frames that work with its lass computer.

'For far too long wearable technology has been either very clunky or too futuristic,' it said.

'This paradigm does not bode well for the user when such a device is centered on their face. That standard will change with this campaign.

'We have designed Icis with you, the user, in mind.

'We have created a product line that can be as unique and as diverse as you are, complementing your face and your style.'

The Icis glasses are the latest in a long line or wearable systems to be announced, with many hoping to take on Google and Apple, which is believed to developing an activity tracking watch.

The glasses are designed to look like normal spectacles - but hide a full; computer and display

'Most products headed into the smartspecs market are clunky, ostentatious, and draw attention away from you and toward the product itself,' the firm says.

'We are creating a device that extends your personality and capabilities instead of aiming to replace them.'

However, the firm has not revealed exactly how its lenses work, simply saying they 'take on the form of conventional eyewear by employing a special set of optics that are blended into the lenses.

The firm has also developed three special modes for the glasses, Normal, Active, and Drive.

Using your phone's on-board sensors, the system knows if you are sitting down, running, or in your car, and will automatically switch between modes and displays.

The 'normal' mode, which displays all of a users social media notifications

Active mode is where fitness and other on-the-go widgets will be placed. In Active mode updates from social networks and email will be limited just to numerical characters that indicate the quantity of notifications from each social network.

Driving mode shows satnav directions along with a smart lane assist

'This simplified elegance is also present in our user interface and overall experience.

'The user interface is mostly comprised of a stream of information presented in a way which does not interfere with your central portion of vision.

'This enables a user experience that is similar to that of a heads-up display on a video game, which allows you to be informed without averting your eyes from the task at hand.'
