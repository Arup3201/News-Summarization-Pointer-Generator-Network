Officials at an upstate New York school district say a kindergartner 
spent the day at the wrong school after getting on the wrong bus and 
even ‘answered to another student’s name.’

Schenectady city school district officials say the series of mistakes began on Wednesday morning when 5-year-old Janeya Evans boarded the wrong bus, which was driven by a substitute driver.

Janeya was supposed to go to Howe Elementary school but instead ended up at Yates Elementary School approximately 2.2 miles away.

Janeya got on the wrong school bus on Wednesday and was a first-grader for a day at a different school

Yates Elementary School and Howe Elementary School are approximately 2.2 miles apart from each other

At the school, teachers were expecting a new first-grader and asked the girl if she was that student. Janeya  said she was and spent the day answering to the no-show first-grader's name.

The mistake wasn't discovered until the kindergartner's mother called her school to report that her daughter didn't get off the bus that afternoon. School officials say they located her a short time later.

'The school just informed us she wasn't in school all day. I'm like, 'What are you talking about?' Janeya's mother Patricia Rodriguez told WNYT.

The district says it's re-examining its bus and new student procedures.

The district also said, 'The confusion could have been avoided at the start of the day when the student boarded the wrong bus, which was driven by a substitute driver.'

Even though Rodriguez agrees that her 
daughter boarded the wrong bus, she recognized the driver who drove 
Janeya to school last week.

Janeya's mother, Patricia Rodriguez, doesn't understand how the school didn't notice Janeya did not belong

Janeya Evans allegedly answered to the name of a new first grader at a different elementary school

'He might have recognized her because he picked her up last week. It was nothing for him either to get her on the bus,' Rodriguez said.

Not only did Janeya get on the wrong bus but when she arrived at Yates Elementary school she answered to a different student's name.

The school district said that the child's behavior was 'misleading.'

'While the student did impersonate another student, which didn’t raise any red flags, the situation has brought to light some other serious issues that need to be addressed on our end, 'said a statement from the school district.

According to the district, Janeya even wrote the other student's name on paper's throughout the day.At home, some of the paperwork had Janeya's name on the top.

'She's a kindergartner. The other child is a first grader,' Rodriguez said.

Rodriguez may consider legal action.

Janeya supposedly wrote the other student's name on her papers too, though some of her papers had her own name
