Janice Dickinson turned her attention on Bill Cosby's wife of 50 years, saying that she made a 'choice' to stay with the shamed comedian despite mounting rape allegations.

Dickinson, 59, said she 'feels bad' for Camille Cosby, who has yet to speak out about the allegations and has silently supported her husband throughout the controversy.

She brought up the entertainer's spouse, in a tearful CNN interview this week in which she revealed new, graphic details of a 1982 meeting in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, at which Cosby allegedly drugged and raped her.

Her words came as yet more women have stepped forward to say Cosby raped them. The mounting number of cases also prompted Dickinson to call on people in Hollywood who work with Cosby to boycott the comedian. 

In a segment of the interview first aired Saturday, Dickinson said: 'I feel bad for her. She knew that he was promiscuous. She stayed married to him. This is her choice, I can't speak for her.

'I can only say to Mrs Cosby that I am sorry I had sex with your husband and he had raped me. I'm sorry that he raped me.

'I'm sorry for you that your husband gave me wine and pills - with the sole intent of having sex with me and raping me.

'I'm sorry for her husband was a philanderer and is rapist, I really mean that, and for his children.

'Maybe Camille Crosby can say something to me about how I feel about what her husband did to me.'

Accusations: Janice Dickinson spoke to CNN, detailing her allegations at length

Speaking to CNN anchor Fredricka Whitfield, she explained in detail her story of being lured out of rehab by an offer to appear on television with Cosby. She claimed he gave her wine and a pill, which caused her to black out.

Dickinson then claimed that she remembers nothing until she woke up after the act covered in Cosby's semen, having been anally and vaginally raped.

She said she left as quickly as possible and didn't speak out for decades through fear.

In light of the mounting evidence she said that Hollywood should rally round her claims and not support him.

She said: 'This man is not a family man that he played on TV, he's a rapist. I would hope that the other actors would get behind me on this.'

She later expanded on what she thought the consequences for Cosby's career should be.

In a separate interview with MSNBC's Ronan Farrow, she said the professional showbusiness world should abandon the comedian.

She said: 'If anyone wants to hire this guy, you’re making a big mistake.

'Bill Cosby should not work anymore he should not be in front of an audience he should not have advertisers attached to [his projects]'.

Dickinson also went into further detail about the night, including the moment Cosby started to rape her.

Defiant: The above was Janice Dickinson's reaction when asked what she would like to say to Cosby's legal team, who have refuted her allegations

She said: 'I remember being absolutely horrified when I felt him get on top of me and start to grunt.

'I don’t remember any conversation and I remember feeling a lot of pain before I blacked out downstairs – in my vagina and I felt it in my anus.

'I remember in the morning waking up. [Memories are] coming up now because I’m sober – I’m sober today, I wasn't sober then.'

Lawyers for Cosby have dismissed the allegations as a work of fantasy. Marty Singer, a Hollywood lawyer representing Cosby, said: 'There is a glaring contradiction between what she is claiming now for the first time and what she wrote in her own book and what she told the media back in 2002.'

However, when confronted with the rebuttal, Dickinson was defiant and said she would keep repeating the allegation.

She said: 'You will not be able to shut me up Marty Singer, you will not be able to shut me up pig Cosby. You will not be able to do this.'

'That’s too nice a word for you – you’re a snake. And you have no empathy, you have no compassion and you’re a bully, you’re a coward yourself and know that we are not liars.'
