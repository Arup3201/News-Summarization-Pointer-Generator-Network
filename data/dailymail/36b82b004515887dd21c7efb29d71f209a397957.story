A mother who credited her seven-year-old son for helping her beat cancer has discovered he too is battling the disease.

Wendy Schmidt, 42, said it was her son Morgan’s ‘hugs and cuddles’ that helped her cope with the stress of breast cancer.

But Morgan has now been diagnosed with the rare cancer Burkitt Lymphoma and she is nursing him through the ordeal.

In it together: Wendy Schmidt is helping her son Morgan battle the condition that she recently beat

‘Morgan is so young but he understands the situation because he has seen me lose my hair,’ says Wendy, a travel agent from Pontprennau, Cardiff.

‘My experience [of cancer] has helped him because he knows he will get through it and that his hair will grow back.’

Wendy had just been given the all clear when she was given the shattering news that Morgan was suffering with a rare cancer affecting children and young adults.

‘One day he turned to me and said: "Mum, have I got cancer?”’ remembers Wendy. ‘We both cried but I promised myself I would never lie to him and I told him he had cancer.

'He's dealing with it really well in spite of everything. He's a happy little lad but he gets a little bit upset when he sees his friends going outside to play.’

Wendy successfully beat breast cancer this year after being diagnosed in 2011 and undergoing two operations, chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Before developing cancer Morgan was an active chap who 'could run around all day'

She says that she was just settling back into normal life when the Morgan's bombshell was announced.

‘My husband Michael and I bought him a rugby ball for Christmas and took him to the park to play,’ says Wendy.

‘But he had no energy at all - we just knew something was wrong because Morgan can normally run around all day.’

The couple took their son to hospital 
where doctors ran tests to see why Morgan had suddenly lost all his 
energy and soon after they received the earth-shattering news.

‘It was surreal - I was just getting over my cancer and then my little boy was diagnosed,’ says Wendy.

'I couldn't believe what was happening to our family. It was beyond any storyline in Eastenders and Coronation Street. No one would have believed it.’

Wendy is keen help Morgan every step of the way because he kept her spirits high through her own health nightmare.

‘My lovely long blonde hair was my pride and joy and I cried when I knew I was going to lose it,' she explains. 'I
was completely bald - I didn't have any eyebrows, eyelashes or any body
hair at all. I

'Iknew I was fighting for my life but Morgan was lovely 
and gave me plenty of cuddles to help me through - I knew I had to 
survive for him.’

Wendy was devastated when she realised breast cancer would cause her to lose her long blonde hair, but Morgan's 'smiles and giggles' cheered her up.

Bright future: Morgan is responding well to treatment

Morgan’s
cancer is aggressive and before treatment the tumour in his stomach had
doubled in size within 24 hours, leading him to put on around four 
pounds in weight.

But the 
future looks bright for young boy. After spending two weeks in hospital 
and undergoing chemotherapy, the latest scans reveal that he is 
responding well to treatment. He is due further check-ups later this 
month.

‘He hasn't got much energy at the moment but he's coped very well,’ says Wendy. ‘We've had more than two years of cancer now but we are strong and we'll get through it together.'

Morgan adds: ‘I love my mum and I know she loves me. Everything will be alright.’
