A family recoiled in horror after they found a dead frog staring out of a bag of greens as they prepared a holiday dinner on Fourth of July.

Collissa Williams, from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, said that she screamed when she saw the dead amphibian nestled in the bag of kale.Â 

Ms Williams said that it was her sister-in-law Gail Cooke who was making the side dish and at first she though the little creature was some scrunched leaves.

Ms Williams told CBS she was 'grossed out... It ruined the whole day'.

The bag of Glory Food's greens, which says on the packet have been washed, was purchased at Giant Eagle grocery store.

Ms Williams said that the store took her complaint very seriously when she returned with the bag and offered her money back.

Glory Foods said that they would be investigating how the frog ended up in the bag but that it was a one-off incident.
