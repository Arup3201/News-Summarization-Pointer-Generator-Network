Sarah stares at the camera, her pupils large and black, and her gaze unfaltering.

Her soft skin is peppered with freckles and the corners of her mouth are turned, just slightly, at the corners.

Though she is not quite smiling, she is beautiful in the dim light of the hospital room.

She has a terminal illness and has accepted that she will soon die.

She is one of 20 people photographed by American photographer Andrew George, who  spent two years in hospitals taking pictures of people like Sarah, who are preparing for the end of their life.

‘At least I got to see the black president,’ reads Sarah’s page in Mr George’s new book, Right Before I Die.

Mr George, who lives in Los Angeles, wanted to explore perspective and what people value in their final moments, saying he admired the ‘brutal honesty’ displayed in his subjects’ testimonies.

He decided to leave out their former professions, or the disease or condition that was killing them, calling these things ‘the least relevant facts’.

Instead, as well as the haunting pictures, he gathered stories from their lives, vignettes of experience and fragments of how they would advise others.

Here, in an extract from his book, he shares some of the photographs and accompanying words...

Sarah, in her hospital bed. She said: ‘Time is so precious. God, it's precious. Life is definitely not infinite. You never know what is going to come up and you really have to take risks. I can’t really think about what’s fair – fair doesn’t make any sense. Things are not fair or unfair, it’s just the way life is. Things happen – or they don’t. You take opportunities – or you don’t’

Josefina, pictured in hospital, said she has never been afraid to die: ‘If you’re dead, you’re dead. That’s it. It doesn’t come back and I don’t think we reincarnate. I know The Bible says otherwise and I don’t want to contradict it, but to me, I don’t believe that. When we die, we die and we go to nothing. Dust to dust... I think the end of the world reaches you when you die’

René said his biggest regret is not being in touch with his daughter in El Salvador. He said: ‘I didn’t give her the right to be part of my life.’ He adds that there is ‘no such thing as happiness in life’. ‘What we call happiness are contributions; all we have is what we are and what we have given at that moment. The meaning of life is the search for it’

Joe wrote just these brief words to accompany his photo. He said: ‘I feel like I am the luckiest man in the world. I have a wonderful wife, son and daughter, grandchildren and great grandchildren. No one could ask for more than that'

Sally said she was taking care of her sick brothers and sisters when she developed cancer. She said being in love is the greatest happiness in life: ‘Being in love is like being in a different world. You can take anything that’s dished out because there’s someone who cares for you. Happiness to me is when you feel good and you make somebody else feel good. You don’t even know what you’re doing and you’re making someone happy’

Kim said people should take the opportunity to tell others how they feel. She said: ‘I’ll be remembered by my mom and kids for how much I care about everybody. And I show it a lot because I think you should. I don’t think you should hold something like that back because we don’t know how long we’re here and if you love somebody you should tell them. They don’t have to love you back but I think that if you love somebody that they should know it because you never know – you don’t know what’s going to happen tomorrow’

Nelly said although she has suffered hardship, she has no regrets. She said: ‘With my first husband I chose someone not knowing that he was a bad guy. I had never been with a man before and from day one throughout all six years of that marriage I had been hit... to the point where I had to go to work with bruises all over my body, raped many, many times and everything else. The day after my second son died, I came home and my husband punched me in the forehead, there was blood all over the place. A week after that, I left with my other son and we went to California. I went on with my life, I went to school and I never asked for child support or anything. I never looked back. I am very happy, actually, and I don’t have regrets even though I’ve been through hell. As far as I know, I’ve accomplished what I’ve had to accomplish in my life’

Sara said being loved makes people offer love to others. She said: 'I think growing up with love makes people give love back. And you have to five love to receive love, you have to be good without expecting anything in return. You do it because it comes from within you to do it. I’ve always fought to improve myself and risen to the occasion. It’s what I was taught growing up and was very ingrained in me. I think that’s what I’ll be remembered for when I pass on’

The exhibition, Right Before I Die, is being held at the Musea Brugge, Belgium, until 28th June 2015.
