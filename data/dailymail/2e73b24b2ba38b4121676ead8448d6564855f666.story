Gareth Bale may have suffered defeat at the hands of AC Milan on Tuesday - but he was still able to show off his skills and do keep-ups with tennis star Novak Djokovic.

Seven-time major winner Djokovic was in attendance for Real Madrid 's 4-2 loss to Milan and he took to The Seven Stadiums pitch at half-time.

Bale and Djokovic then took it in turns to perform keep-ups during the break at the Dubai Football Challenge.

It helped the Real forward to forget about the loss and enjoy himself as Madrid's spectacular 2014 ended with somewhat of a whimper.

Serbian Djokovic is a keen Milan fan, although he also supports Red Star Belgrade and Portuguese side Benfica, and was in attendance for the game.

Strikes from Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema were not enough for Carlo Ancelotti's men as goals from Jeremy Menez and Giampaolo Pazzini, as well as a brace from Stephan El Shaarawy, ensured Milan were victorious.
