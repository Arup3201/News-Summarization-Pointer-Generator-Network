If glowing patient testi-monials are 
anything to go by, the Veinwave ‘zapper’ can work near-miracles. 
Manufacturers promise the device, which emits microwaves, can instantly 
erase unsightly thread veins on the face and body.

Yet
 the stock treatment given in skin clinics for these troublesome 
blemishes is laser therapy. This  is potentially uncomfortable, with 
weeks of bruising and scabbing commonly seen afterwards, and  it often 
doesn’t completely solve  the problem.

Veinwave, on the other hand, causes little more than a slight redness which fades after a few hours.

Vanishing act: A patient's nose before treatment, left, where microwaves are targeted at the red veins in short bursts, and after treatment, right

Thanks
 largely to word-of-mouth, Dr Newmans Clinics, which offer the 
treatment, has seen more than 2,000 patients, a third of whom had other 
types of thread vein removal without success. It begs the question: If 
Veinwave works, why isn’t it offered by all doctors?

Like
 so many medical discoveries, Veinwave was a happy side effect of a 
different investigation. In 1998, consultant vascular surgeon Dr Brian 
Newman was pursuing a treatment for cellulite – testing the premise that
 stimulating the skin with microwaves might reduce the dimpling effect. 
It didn’t, but he noticed that small thread veins were vanishing from 
patients’ legs.

Today, the treatment is offered at Dr Newmans Clinic in Central  London and three other branches nationwide.

Yet
 aside from gaining a patent for his technology, Dr Newman has carried 
out no trials or published any research. As a result, few medics seem to
 have even heard of it, let alone recommend it.

Thread
 veins – also known as spider veins (the medical term is telangiectasia)
 – are simply veins which are visible below the skin. There is a genetic
 link, so you  may have a predisposition to them, and incidence 
increases with age, smoking and sun exposure.

‘People
 get incredibly distressed about these blemishes on their faces,’ says 
Dr Peter Finigan, Medical Director of Dr Newmans Clinic. ‘Men in 
particular feel that they look like alcoholics as they tend to develop 
chunky veins on their noses. But often they don’t drink.’

No laughing matter: Comedian W.C. Fields was famous for his red nose

So
 just what is this treatment? ‘Microwaves are simply high frequency 
radiowaves. These are emitted from the fine needle that constitutes the 
tip of the device,’ explains Dr Finigan.

‘The short, sharp bursts of heat – pulsing every 0.2 of a second –  are directed at the wall of the offending vein.’

While the skin surface isn’t heated, these short bursts cause the protein within the wall to coagulate.

‘It’s like heating up egg white,’ says Dr Finigan. ‘The protein becomes sticky and seals off the vein. As it is the blood giving the thread vein its red colour, once it cannot flow through there, the redness vanishes.’

The needle is used to track the vein across the face every one or two millimetres. The feeling is that of a tiny pinprick and no anaesthetic is needed.

Over the next few days the body reabsorbs the redundant vein wall. And although there are no formal clinical trials, Jean Marc Chardonneau, a French aesthetic doctor in Nantes, conducted a successful 2004 study into the effects of thermocoagulation using a similar machine on telangiectasia on the leg with 50 patients.

‘We see hundreds of patients a year. I’d say that all of them are very happy with their results,’ says Dr Finigan.

‘About 40 per cent come back for further treatment at some stage. We aren’t re-treating the same veins, but new ones which have accumulated over the years.’

In one per cent of patients, redness may take a few days to dissipate. But the videos on the clinic’s website are extraordinary – as the minute tip of the instrument touches the veins they simply vanish.

So what of the other options for thread veins? Most doctors recommend Intense Pulsed Light (IPL), a device that emits light waves to destroy red veins.

Treatment costs from £500, and results could be described as modest. A large scale study into IPL for facial telangiectasia concluded that patients had a 30 per cent reduction in the veins’ appearance. And IPL is limited in that it can only be used on fair skin.

Another option is pulsed dye laser. Jo Martin, of Nottingham’s Mapperley Park Clinic, says: ‘With the modern pulsed dye laser, people tend not to have any bruising, although older models cause dark bruises, which can be unsightly and take over a week to settle.’

Finally, sclerotherapy is the injection of a substance into thread veins, which causes damage to cell walls and causes the vessel to shrink over a few weeks. It is generally more appropriate for leg veins.

‘We find microsclerotherapy much more effective for treating legs but less so on the face,’ says vascular surgeon Dr John Scurr. Professor Nick Lowe at London’s Cranley Clinic, who was given a demonstration of Veinwave, adds: ‘I would treat the whole face with IPL or pulsed dye laser and consider Veinwave for remaining veins.’

The problem is, say experts, without proper research the overall effectiveness of the microwave zapper is unknown. And so, those who have it are essentially guinea pigs.

‘We’re aware of Veinwave, but I don’t recommend it,’ says Dr Scurr. ‘They have to come up with real hard proof.’
