When Jeremy and Kathryn Medlen got a call from a local shelter saying their beloved dog, Avery, was found safe, they were overjoyed.

The dog had run off from their Fort Worth, Texas property a few days earlier during a thunderstorm in 2009.

But when Mr Medlen went to the pound with their two young children, they received the heartbreaking news - Avery had been mistakenly euthanized.

Best friend: Avery was a beloved member of the Medlen family before being accidentally euthanized

'They were told they accidentally killed him the day before," Medlen's attorney, Randy Turner, told ABC News.

The shelter, Forth Worth Animal Control, had properly labeled Avery's cage as 'Hold for owner' but a worker there still put the mixed-breed dog down.

'She went through and picked the dogs that needed to be euthanized and accidentally picked Avery,' said Turner.

That's when the family decided to bring its lawsuit, charging negligence against the shelter and the worker, Carla Strickland.

Texas state law includes a 1963 rule that allows people to sue for the sentimental value of property even if there is no monetary value on the open market.

The rule has previously been applied to irreplaceable photographs or family heirlooms, but never to  a family pet.

Ms Strickland's lawyer, John Cayce, said she instantly felt terrible after learning about her tragic mistake.

"Ms. Strickland, from day one, has been devastated by the unfortunate accident that occurred that led to Avery's death," Cayce said.

During Thursday's argument before the Texas Supreme Court, a lawyer representing the shelter said it was impossible to assign value to a pet.

"My dog may be worth $1 million to me — should that much money go to an owner for pain and suffering?" asked Elizabeth Choate, the general counsel of the Texas Veterinary Medical Association, according to the Wall Street Journal.

A decision in the case is not expected for several weeks.
