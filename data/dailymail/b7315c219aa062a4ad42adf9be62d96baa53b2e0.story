A Guatemalan man who was born severely deformed has opened up about the incredible surgery, and generous people, he found in America that helped him to turn his life around.

Martin Oliva-Torres' widespread eyes and a bulging forehead brought him scorn and ridicule as a young man living near Guatemala City and even his family treated him like a monster.

His mother died three months after his birth and his father promptly abandoned the family, leaving his grandmother in charge. But the now-52-year-old high school custodian said she beat him regularly and fed him scraps, specifically chicken leftovers.

All smiles: Glancing into the mirror, his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide, the once-deformed Martin Oliva-Torres jokes: 'Man, I'm so handsome'

'I would ask for the legs, and I got the feet,' he recalled to The Dallas Morning News.

Oliva-Torres wasn't allowed to go to school, and his facial deformities meant no one would give him a job.

At 23, he finally found work washing cars but the downtrodden man, whose deformities impaired his vision and his breathing, used the cash to buy alcohol and cigarettes.

'I was angry,' he said. 'I was angry with myself, the people.'

But in December 1984 his luck changed.

Oliva-Torres was standing in the street when an American woman named 'Angie' pulled over in a Jeep and asked him whether he wanted to go to the United States to see a doctor.

She took him to an orphanage for disfigured children where Oliva-Torres saw others just like him and felt less alone, he told the newspaper.

After filling out the necessary paperwork, he packed his few belongings and prepared to board a flight to America.

He was given an abandoned 14-month-old boy named Bernie, who had a large protrusion between his eyes and a fever, to take with him.

Washington-based nonprofit, Healing 
the Children, flew the two to Houston and then they were driven to 
Dallas, where craniofacial surgeon, Dr Kenneth Salyer, would change 
Oliva-Torres' life forever.

A selfless couple, Zane and Phyllis Jude, took in the Spanish-speaking Oliva-Torres, Bernie and a 9-year-old from Mexico who was born without ears, despite not sharing their language and having to communicate by sign.

'I did it because I heard the voice of God,' Zane Jude told the Morning News. 'And if I had to do it all over, I'd do it again. He added: 'Would you believe me if I told you I didn't even see their deformities?'

The strangers bonded immediately.

'Phyllis came up and gave us a hug. It was something, because I never had that from my own grandma' said Oliva-Torres, who for the first time had regular meals and a bed.

Just over a year after he arrived in the U.S., Oliva-Torres underwent his first of a series of surgeries, all of which would be performed at no cost to him.

Salyer said he doesn't know whether Oliva-Torres' deformities were a result of poor prenatal care or genetics because so little is known about his family's medical history.

'All I knew was here was another young human being who was absolutely not accepted by society and was totally down and out,' he told the Morning News.

The doctors removed 20 millimeters of bone between his eyes, rebuilt his forehead and created a new nose with excess skin, Salyer said.

As his face began to change Oliva-Torres' taught himself English by reading Bibles in English and Spanish side by side and landed his first job at the Salvation Army in Dallas.

Oliva-Torres later would meet his future wife, Delores, in church. The couple now live in Palmer, 30 minutes outside Dallas. 'He's my inspiration,' she said.

But even as his appearance improved, something was missing.

'It was awesome to see the change in my face,' he said, 'but inside â€” the inside wasn't changed.'One day he started praying along with a religious sermon on TV, and found it helped. He found strength in his newfound faith.

After many years, he was able to forgive his grandmother, his community and himself.

Now, once a month, he gives a sermon in Spanish at Palmer First Assembly of God about the importance of forgiveness and posts inspirational messages daily on his Facebook page.

'He's very enthusiastic,' said First Assembly of God pastor Carmen Ingram. 'He loves to pray for people. He's very sensitive in the spirit.'

Glancing into the mirror, his black hair perfectly in place and his smile wide, Oliva-Torres joked: 'Man, I'm so handsome.'

But his appreciation for the incredible chance he was given to change his life is no joke.

'I'm living in a dream. It's a long dream I haven't woken up from... I'm blessed,' he said.
