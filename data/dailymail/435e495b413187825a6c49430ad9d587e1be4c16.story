Jim Brisbane of the Crown Prosecution Service commuted from his home in Wales to London

A senior Crown Prosecution Service official who commuted from his Welsh home to stay in a taxpayer-funded flat in London received £88,000 in expenses to cover the cost of his long-distance journey.

Jim Brisbane, Chief Operations Officer of the CPS has an annual salary of £120,000, but he received more than £3,000-a-month to cover the costs of his journey from his five-bedroom home in Llanelli to London and his accommodation while staying in the capital.

Civil service rules state that pay packages should be limited to £142,500, although, once Mr Brisbane's travel and accommodation were considered, his deal exceeded this figure. 

An audit by accountants inside the CPS discovered the problem and officials had to secure special permission from Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander for the additional payments. 

According to The Sun's Brian Flynn, Mr Brisbane insisted that he had not done anything wrong. 

He told the paper: 'The rules are that if you are required to move for your job then they would have had to buy me a house. I thought that would be inappropriate for me to do that.' 

He said that he needed to live in London to do the job and properties in the capital are expensive.

Mr Brisbane has more than 35 years' experience in the legal profession, practicing as a solicitor in England and Wales after graduating from Glasgow University. 

He moved to Scotland in 1988, where he joined the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service. In January 2008, be was appointed Chief Crown Prosecutor for Dyfed Powys in January 2008. 

He was then appointed to his current position as Chief Operations Officer of the CPS.

A CPS spokesperson said: 'The post holder was one of the candidates encouraged to apply for this critical role in order to ensure there was the strongest possible field of candidates - even though he had made it clear he could not move full time to London - because of his impeccable track record and colossal wealth of experience.

'At interview he was clearly the outstanding candidate, and so relocation support was agreed to allow him to work in London during the week, which has been fully approved and is within Civil Service rules.

'Since taking the role he has helped to lead the CPS through an unprecedented period of change, also bringing some real improvements in performance. 

But the Taxpayers' Alliance has questioned the CPS's use of resources claiming that 'throwing away money like this rubs salt into the wounds'.
