Officials seized thousands of pounds of narcotics with the arrest of 70 suspected drug smugglers in what is being described as a 'jaw-dropping' confiscation by authorities in Arizona.

The suspected cartel in Sinaloa Mexico under Kingpin Joaquin 'El Champ' Guzman, is believed to handle 65 percent of all drugs transported illegally into the United States.

'This is one of the more substantial drug-smuggling operations going on right now. This is a billion-dollar drug trade organization linked to the cartel,' an official with the investigation told Reuters.

The operation carried over a 17-month period, included three raids in conglomeration with local, state and federal officials.

Both Mexican and American nations 
were arrested who were found working with the cartel based in Sinaloa, a
coastal Northwestern state in Mexico.

The area is home to large 
marijuana and opium poppy plantations and according to Reuters, is 
considered the 'cradle' to narcotics trafficking in Mexico for the past 
50 years.

Among the narcotics confiscated by authorities, money, weapons, ammunition and bullet-proof vests were taken.

The drugs were found smuggled from Mexico to Arizona by means of car, plane, foot, as well as through tunnels.

The
Mexican drug cartel described by the official as a 'sophisticated 
network' is also one of the largest operations in the southwestern 
United States today.

Just last year the Sinaloa cartel under 'El Champ,' was feared by U.S. intelligence as winning the Mexican drug war.

In just a two-year battle, 5,000 people were killed, resulting in the Mexican kingpin controlling coveted trafficking routes for their operations.

Tens of thousands of people total, 
however, have been killed since Mexican President Felipe Calderon 
initiated a military campaign to fight the cartels following his 
presidency in 2006.

All of those killed were by drug-related violence.

The official speaking with Reuters says they are still in search of dozens more in connection to the operation.

Those who have been captured, some serving as key players to the operations, will be prosecuted on the state level.
