TV shows, movies and books are full of suggestions of where to hide out from a zombie apocalypse, but researchers at Cornell claim to have found the safest place.

Rick and his band of refugees from Atlanta in 'The Walking Dead' tried a remote farmhouse and a prison; 'Dawn of the Dead' had survivors holed up in a shopping mall; and 'Shaun of the Dead' proposed the local pub.

It's fair to say that most of these hideouts did not work out that well for those involved.

Researchers from Cornell University have now discovered that the correct thing to do should the dead start to walk the earth is to literally head for the hills.

Characters on 'The Walking Dead' have tried several different hide outs from the zombie apocalypse, including a remote farm and a prison, but researchers at Cornell think they have found the ideal place to go

Alexander Alemi, Matthew Bierbaum, Christopher Myers and James Sethna used an approach for modelling disease to work out how an actual outbreak might play out.

They found that cities would fall quickly, but it would take weeks for zombies to penetrate into less densely populated areas, and months to reach northern parts of the mountain-time zone.

Their advice is to head for the Rockies.

The research involved results from simulations the researchers wrote themselves, similar to modelling chemical reactions.

'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' Alemi told phys.org. 

There are four states a person can be in (human, infected, zombie, dead zombie), and these are dependent on possible interactions (zombie bites human, human kills zombie, zombie moves etc).

'Given the dynamics of the disease, once the zombies invade more sparsely populated areas, the whole outbreak slows down - there are fewer humans to bite, so you start creating zombies at a slower rate,' says Alemi.

'Modeling zombies takes you through a lot of the techniques used to model real diseases, albeit in a fun context,' said researcher Alexander Alemi

The research team were inspired by a graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z' by Max Brooks. The CDC uses a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool to teach emergency preparedness

'I'd love to see a fictional account where most of New York City falls in a day, but upstate New York has a month or so to prepare.'

The researchers aim to add more complicated social variables to their simulation such as awareness of the outbreak and ability to make a run for it.

The group were inspired by graduate statistical mechanics class and by reading 'World War Z: an oral history of the first zombie war' by Max Brooks.

Indeed the conclusions of their research match up with some of the plot points of the book, which sees the U.S. abandon two-thirds of the country and retreat behind the Rockies to regroup before launching a counterattack.

They found that cities would fall quickly as large numbers people that would be quickly infected as in the movie 'World War Z', but it would take weeks for zombies to get to less densely populated areas like the Rockies

The Cornell team are less optimistic about our prospects.

The abstract for their research ends with the line: 'We build up to a full scale simulation of an outbreak in the United States, and discover that for "realistic" parameters, we are largely doomed.'

Despite this, since 2011 the Center for Disease Control and Prevention has playfully used a zombie apocalypse as a learning tool for teaching emergency preparedness.

The group presents its findings during the 2015 American Physical Society March Meeting, on Thursday, March 5 in San Antonio, Texas.

With fewer humans to bite you, rural areas create zombies at a much slower rate

However they conclude that using realistic parameters in their simulation 'we are largely doomed'
