We all like to take holiday photographs to remind us of the good time we had.

But the snaps Monica Bounds brought back from a £900 ‘world class cruise’ were images she would much rather forget.

While the brochures boast you can ‘indulge in escapism’ as friendly staff ‘do their utmost to make every part of your cruise experience special’, the reality was a holiday from hell.

Illness: Monica Bounds, 61, right, documented her 'holiday from hell' with friend Veronica Godfrey on a cruise around the Med on a ship which was overrun with norovirus

According to Mrs Bounds, 61, the luxury liner Boudicca was effectively a ‘plague ship’ riddled with norovirus, which left numerous passengers ‘quarantined’ in cabins as crew wore masks and nuclear disaster-style suits.

She claims staff were secretly placed on a ‘Code Red’ warning that forbade them to touch passengers. Many guests spent the trip suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea, she said.

According to operator Fred Olsen cruise lines, 61 of 732 passengers became ill with the highly contagious virus – more than 8 per cent.

Mrs Bounds spent much of her ten-day cruise isolated in her cabin, where seriously ill friend Veronica Godfrey was on two drips hooked over a coathanger and hanging from a porthole. Mrs Bounds claims Fred Olsen knew there were problems with infection, but failed to clean satisfactorily.

And just hours after the retired nurse arrived back in Portsmouth last  Saturday the ship sailed again with 800 new passengers, she said.

Behind closed doors: Crew wore protective clothes and 'were not allowed to touch passengers' according to Mrs Bounds

Three years ago the law firm Irwin Mitchell, representing 85 passengers, questioned whether Boudicca should remain in service – claiming it had five norovirus outbreaks in 18 months.

Mrs Bounds, who lives with husband Mike, 62, in Dingestow, Monmouthshire, said: ‘It was like a plague ship.

‘I barely went out of my cabin because I was confined there with my friend Veronica, who’s from Gloucestershire, with the crew bringing us food. She was so ill I watched all night, worrying she wasn’t going to make it.

‘The worst thing was they already knew they had had the norovirus, because they delayed our departure from Portsmouth for 24 hours to disinfect it. It’s disgusting.

‘Common sense tells you that you can’t disinfect an entire cruise ship in 24 hours, because viruses could get into the air conditioning, the heating, and the ventilation systems.

‘Because the virus involves sickness and diarrhoea, you can imagine what it was like.’

Contagion: Even the books on the the ship run by Fred Olsen Cruise Lines had to be sanitised

Mrs Bounds said the illness spread within 24 hours.

Public lavatories were closed and the casino was off bounds in case cards were infected. She said: ‘We learned from one of the new staff on board that all crew members were on “Code Red”, which he said meant crew were not allowed to touch passengers unless using protective clothing.

‘I think this alone shows the seriousness of the outbreak.

‘My friend Veronica, who’s 70 and a retired accountant and property developer, was very ill and the crew told us that in their opinion she was too ill to be airlifted from the ship. But the ship was loaded with another lot of passengers soon after we got off, and our cabin was being cleaned by a normal maid. I saw no sign of it being deep-cleaned or sterilised.’

Expensive cruises have surged in popularity recently – but are all too often struck by virus outbreaks, which spread rapidly in enclosed spaces.

A Fred Olsen spokesman said: ‘The number of guests affected during the cruise was 61, out of a total of 732 guests.

‘The highest number of guests isolated at any one time was 29. Boudicca underwent an extensive “deep clean” and sanitising operation by independent specialist contractors before she embarked. It was extremely disappointing that, following these rigorous measures, the virus was brought back on to the ship.’
