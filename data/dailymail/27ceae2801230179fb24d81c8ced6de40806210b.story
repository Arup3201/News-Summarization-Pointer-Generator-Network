Cleveland kidnapping victim Michelle Knight performed a touching rendition of Celine Dion's My Heart Will Go On in honor of the son taken away from her before she was kidnapped by Ariel Castro, it emerged today.

Dressed as an angel and with face paint on, the 32-year-old took the stage at Cleveland's Boo-You-Bash event on October 12.

She grew very emotional towards the end of the song and had to be comforted by someone after she broke down in tears.

Tell-all: Michelle will be the first victim to break her silence after an exclusive interview with Dr Phil which will be aired in a three-part special between November 4 and 6

The video, recorded by Broco-El-Unico, was released at the same time as it emerged Michelle will be the first victim to break her silence after an exclusive interview with Dr Phil which will be aired in a three-part special between November 4 and 6.

She is expected to make never-before-heard revelations about what went on in Castro's Cleveland house of horrors as she recalls the day-to-day details of her decade in captivity in a manner described as 'passionate, moving and poignant'.

'She is the self-proclaimed, most hated victim in the house, and according to Knight, suffered the most abuse at the hands of Castro,' a statement said.

Dr Phil said of the interview: 'Michelle Knight's story of horror and 
courageous survival almost defies description and has changed me like no
other in 12 years of doing the show. Her dark journey 
from victim to victor is beyond compelling.'

It also emerged today that victims Amanda Berry and Gina DeJesus are collaborating with a Pulitzer Prize-winning team of Washington Post
reporters for a planned book about their ordeal. 

Michelle was abducted on August 23, 2002 when she was 21 years old, a year before Amanda Berry in April 2003. A year later Gina deJesus joined them.

The three escaped from Castro's home on May 6, 2013.

In a 
statement issued yesterday, an attorney for Berry and DeJesus said they will work with the Post's Mary Jordan, a
Cleveland native, and her husband and fellow reporter, Kevin Sullivan.

No meetings with publishers have been scheduled, although interest would
likely be based on the popularity of another kidnapping survivor's 
memoir, Jaycee Dugard's A Stolen Life.

Castro had been sentenced to life in prison, plus 1,000 years, but is believed to have committed suicide in prison last month.

'Many
have told, and continue to tell, this story in ways that are both 
inaccurate and beyond the control of these young women,' said James 
Wooley, the attorney for Berry and DeJesus.

'Our clients have a strong 
desire for privacy, but it is a reality that confronts them every day. 
Gina, Amanda and their families have decided to take control and are now
interested in telling the story of what happened to them.'

Wooley
said in his statement that he had known Jordan for years and contacted 
her about the project.

Jordan said during a recent interview that
she was drawn to the 'resilience' of Berry and DeJesus and was eager to
help them tell an 'amazing story of overcoming adversity'.

In 2003, she
and Sullivan won a Pulitzer for their series about the Mexican criminal
justice system.

Investigators said the three victims were bound, repeatedly raped and deprived 
of food and bathroom facilities.

At his sentencing, Knight told Castro: 'I spent 11 years in hell, now your hell is just beginning'. She was the only one of the three girls to attend.
