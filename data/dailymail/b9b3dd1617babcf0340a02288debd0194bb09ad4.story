Aldi has been hailed as one of the major successes of the recession, with affluent shoppers heading to the budget supermarket in a bid to save money in tough times.

But after the German retailer announced plans to set up in a genteel seaside town, residents vowed to keep it out - saying they would prefer a branch of middle-class favourite Waitrose.

Frinton-on-Sea appeared on a list of 50 towns where Aldi wants to open a new store as it bids to win market share from Britain's big four supermarkets - Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons.

Spot the difference: Councillors say they would rather have a branch of Waitrose than Aldi

Councillors in the Essex town - which previously fought against the opening of its first pub - have reacted unhappily to the news, and say they will try to keep the budget store out.

'I will be surprised if they get a look-in,' said mayor Iris Johnson. 'There was a lot of opposition here to Tesco coming into Frinton and I am sure Aldi could see the same.

'I am not sure where they would find an appropriate site.'

Another councillor, who did not want to be named, declared: 'We want something like a Waitrose here instead.

'Places like Aldi and Lidl are doing very well in some places because people are happy to pick up a bargain. But it is the lower end of the market.'

The reaction from Frinton locals contrasts to nearby Clacton-on-Sea, where shoppers queued for hours when a branch of Aldi opened last October.

Frinton, which has a population of 5,500, is known for its retirement homes and independent shops, and houses there regularly sell for more than £2million.

The town has a long history of battling against change - in 2000, hundreds of people fought a passionate but unsuccessful campaign against Frinton's first ever pub, The Lock & Barrel.

Those opposing the ale house had warned if it was to get the go-ahead, it would be 'the worst day in Frinton since the Luftwaffe blew the town up in 1944'.

And in 2009, there was outrage at proposals from Network Rail to remove the town's iconic 'gates' - the manned level crossing - and replace it with an automated crossing.

The town's deputy mayor at the time declared there could be fighting on the streets which would be 'reminiscent of the Poll Tax riots'.

Aldi - which made revenues of nearly £4billion in 2012 - has asked landowners to submit plans of their sites as it identifies potential new locations.

The retailer, which along with Lidl has grown in popularity during the economic slump, promises 'attractive commission packages' to landowners who agree to host supermarket branches.
