'Huge numbers' of migrants from Romania and Bulgaria could place a major strain on Britain’s education system, Sir Michael Wilshaw warned last night.

The Government faced a ‘big job’ in ensuring England has enough quality teachers to cope with the potential influx from the two countries when immigration restrictions are lifted at the end of this month, said the Chief Inspector of Schools.

‘Obviously I have got concerns about that,’ he said. ‘If we get huge numbers of children from overseas and from Eastern Europe coming in, we have to have enough teachers to teach them and resources available in schools.’

England’s schools are already facing a potential classroom crisis as they deal with a rising birthrate which is being partly fuelled by immigration.

A survey by the Local Government Association in September found that almost half of England’s school districts will have more primary pupils than places within two years.

Some areas face a 20 per cent shortfall, according to analysis of official date from 2012.

He said schools needed the right number of teachers and resources to educate increased numbers of pupils

Sir Michael also said grammar schools are ‘stuffed full of middle-class kids’ and had almost no role in improving the education of the poor.

‘A tiny percentage are on free school meals – three per cent. That
 is a nonsense,’ he said. 

‘Anyone
 who thinks grammar schools are going to increase social mobility needs 
to look at those figures. I don’t think they work.’ 

His comments angered
 Tory MPs who believe expanding the grammar system could help reverse 
the decline in social mobility.

Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 
1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, described Sir Michael’s 
intervention as ‘unwise’.

Statistics show areas with selective state schools dominated GCSE and A-level results last year.

Reading
 came top, with 45.9 per cent of pupils gaining grades AAB or equivalent
 in 2012, followed by Trafford with 34.5 per cent. The state sector 
average is 16.8 per cent.

In an interview with the Observer, Sir Michael suggested grammar 
schools only helped an elite 10 per cent of pupils – often with pushy 
parents.

It is the second 
blow in a week for the grammar system, following a decision by Education
 Secretary Michael Gove on Friday to block an application to create a 
new ‘supergrammar’ in Sevenoaks, Kent.
