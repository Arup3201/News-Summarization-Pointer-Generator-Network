Chinese scientists predict stem cells obtained from urine could allow humans to regrow lost teeth.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences has created tooth-like structures in mice and believes one day bioengineered 'tooth buds' could be transplanted into humans who have lost their teeth.

The primitive tooth-like structures are the first solid tissues to be developed using a technique in which discarded cells from human waste can be coaxed into becoming stem cells.

The scientists used a new system of tissue culture to grow cells into tiny structures resembling teeth, which they implanted into mice.

The stem cells were generated from urine, based on previous studies which have shown discarded cells in human waste can be coaxed into becoming pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).

These can then themselves generate many different cell types, including neurons and heart muscle cells.

According to Cell Regeneration Journal, the tooth buds are the first solid organs or tissues made from iPSCs.

The scientists said the method could be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth

Dr Duanqing Pei, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, created the tooth-like structures by forcing iPSCs to mimic two different cell types: epithelial cells, which give rise to enamel, and mesenchymal cells, which give rise to the other three main components of teeth - dentin, cementum and pulp.

He first created flat sheets of epithelial cells which the researchers then mixed with mouse embryonic mesenchymal cells.

The product of their labours was transplanted into mice, and three weeks later, tooth-like structures had grown.

Dr Pei said: 'The primitive teeth-like organs are structurally and physically similar to human teeth.

'They are of roughly the same elasticity, and contain pulp, dentin and enamel-forming cells.

'But the method has its limitations - it involves mouse cells, has a success rate of around 30 per cent and the structures were about one-third of the hardness of human teeth.'

The researchers believe that tweaking the mixture of cells and the condition of the culture tissue could solve these problems.

They said: 'The revised method could, in theory, be used to create a bioengineered tooth bud that could be cultured in vitro then transplanted into the jawbone of a needy patient to form a fully functional tooth.'

Cells generated from a patient's urine would not be rejected by the host recipient, as they would be derived from the host's own cellular material' the scientists said.

They believe iPSCs remain a great source of hope for regenerative medicine.
