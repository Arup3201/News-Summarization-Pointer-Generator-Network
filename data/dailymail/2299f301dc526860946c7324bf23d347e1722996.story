Giuseppe Rossi could be sidelined for up to five months after having an operation on his troublesome right knee.

Fiorentina said the forward underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair his meniscus but that the operation showed no ligament damage.

The 27-year-old has been plagued by injuries for the last four seasons, curtailing what should have been an important stage in the Italian's career.

It was Rossi’s fourth operation on his right knee. He missed four months of last season with a sprained ligament, and the New Jersey-born forward was left out of Italy’s World Cup squad because of the injury. 

Rossi was named in Cesare Prandelli’s provisional 30-man list but omitted from the final squad because of doubts over his fitness.

Fiorentina said  that Rossi will begin his rehab in New York next week before returning to Florence.

Rossi led Serie A with 14 goals in 17 games before injuring the medial collateral ligament in his knee from a hard tackle by Livorno’s Leandro Rinaudo on Jan. 5. 

Rossi tore his right anterior cruciate ligament during a game for Villarreal against Real Madrid in October 2011 and needed three operations before returning in May 2013 with Fiorentina. He has seven goals in 29 international appearances.
