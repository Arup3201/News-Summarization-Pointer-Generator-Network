Texas teen Kendall Jones drew the ire of
 thousands last month with her Facebook photos showing her smiling 
alongside rare African beasts, but the cheerleader was the toast of the 
Texas Trophy Hunters Association Hunting Extravaganza in Houston at the 
weekend.

Jones of Cleburne didn’t speak to the media, but she 
was happy to pose with fans – many of them young girls - who attended the event on Saturday 
and Sunday.

‘So many cute little girls showing me their hunting 
pics,’ Jones wrote on her Facebook page next to one picture.  And next 
to another she wrote, 'It was truly amazing to meet all of my 
supporters.'

The majority of comments on the TTHA Facebook page were supportive of Jones, with one fan writing, 'We need more of 
your kind. You are what makes America strong.'

Another wrote, 'You have done a great job representing Texas and hunters everywhere,' reports EverythingLubbock.

Last month Jones
 posted Facebook pictures showing her posing beside dead animals such as a 
lion, a leopard and other African big game that she had allegedly killed.

Jones 
received death threats and the Texas Tech cheerleader's dad Cody Jones demanded the removal of the page 'Kill Kendall Jones' that featured posts condemning the huntress as well as a picture of a lion smiling atop a dead hunter.

Fair game? A mock Facebook page called 'Kill Kendall Jones' cropped up in the wake of the controversy over a Texas teen college cheerleader's Facebook pictures featuring her rare African trophy kills

'Credible threat': Facebook removed this page by Thursday despite initial claims from Kendall's supporters that their calls to have it taken down had been rebuffed

In
 a statement, Facebook said it removes 'reported content that promotes 
poaching of endangered species, the sale of animals for organized fight 
or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'.

The decision sparked outrage from Jones' father, who sent to TMZ the response he got from Facebook saying the anti-Kendall page could stay.

Facebook has since removed the page for representing a 'credible threat of violence' toward the teen.

It came after more than a quarter of a million animal lovers signed a petition urging
 Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to take down the photos in which Jones smiles 
proudly over the corpses of her prey she claims to be saving from 
extinction.

Removed: Facebook had taken down this photo of Kendall Jones, 19, with a lion that she hunted in Africa. The social networking site said that the image - and others - violate their standards

'For the sake of all animals,' the petition against Jones reads as it implores
 animal lovers to sign, 'especially the animals in the African region...
 where hunters are going for fun just to kill an animal!'

After starting the social media firestorm, the cheerleader hit back at her attackers by saying she is actually protecting wildlife. 

In a typo-laden defense that invoked 
the safari-loving 26th U.S. president Teddy Roosevelt, she claimed 
killing rare rhinos and elephants helps to save them.

'This
 is a conservation effort to assure [sic] that they never do become 
extinct,' the teen from Cleburne, Texas posted to Facebook.

Gone: Facebook has also removed this image of her with an elephant. It said it removes 'content that promotes poaching of endangered species... or content that includes extreme acts of animal abuse'

'[Roosevelt]
 was a hunter too, right? He killed the same species that hunters now 
chase today under a mound of anti-hunting pressure.

'Yet,
 how can it be possible that someone can love the earth, and take from 
the Earth in the name of conservation? For some folks, they'll never 
understand. For the rest of us...we were born that way. God Bless 
Teddy,' wrote Jones.

Jones, whose Facebook indicates

 she 'is looking to host a TV show in January 2015,' said here isn't 
always space for threatened species like elephants or lions.

'Controlling the male lion population 
is important within large fenced areas like these,' Jones writes.

'Funds
 from a hunt like this goes partially to the government for permits but 
also to the farm owner as an incentive to keep and raise lions on their 
property.'

'This is a conservation effort!': The Texas Tech cheerleader said she is helping the animals by killing them

Big 5: Jones says her first kill was a rare African white rhino, part of her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (rhino, elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard and lion)

Legal: The young hunter has many critics but also a lot of supporters who say what she's doing is fine, since she pays the governments of African countries to kill the animals

Jones' photos showed her posing with bagged zebras, hugging a dead leopard, and smiling beside elephants she had killed.

One
 particular photo, in which she posed alongside an extremely 
endangered rhinoceros, had her critics especially steaming, but the 
Texas Tech cheerleader says it was alive and well.

'The
 vet drew blood, took DNA samples, took body and head measurements, 
treated a leg injury and administered antibiotics. I felt very lucky to 
be part of such a great program and procedure that helps the White Rhino
 population through conservation,' she wrote.

However,
 Jones has in her quest to bag the Big 5 African game animals (lion, 
elephant, Cape buffalo, leopard, and White/Black rhinoceros) shot a 
white rhino, which number around 20,000.

Because
 of her enthusiasm for killing rare game and what they say is her 
dubious standing as a conservationist, some critics say Jones should be 
banned from hunting in Africa completely.

Pride: Jones learned how to hunt after she went with her father to Africa for his own hunts at age 9

'Cruelty': Critics say she is not 
a conservationist and is simply trying to get a television deal with the pictures

Boasts: 'This time I got my leopard,' she wrote a safari when she was 14.  'And also took down a hippo'

A second petition, this one on change.org and originating from South Africa, is hoping to do just that.

'Kendall
 Jones is an American born hunter who has entered the continent and has 
been hunting African wildlife under the facade of conservation,' reads 
the petition.

It 
continues: 'She has publicly stated that she hopes to have a television 
hunting show and she is using endangered and helpless African animals as
 a stepping to further her popularity on social media platforms.'

But she also has her supporters. A Facebook account, Support Kendall Jones, has also started.

'Support this teenage girl who was attacked for posting pictures of her game that she legally harvested while in Africa,' reads the page.
