A woman who suspected her 89-year-old grandmother was being abused in a Bronx nursing home took the ingenious step of installing a hidden camera in the base of a potted plant last June.

Granddaughter Diana Valentin was horrified by footage from September, which allegedly shows a caregiver 'twisting the arm' of elderly Ana Louisa Medina and 'slamming' the helpless Alzheimer's sufferer into the bed.

Nurse's aide Sandra Kerr, 55, has been arrested and charged with endangering the welfare of a physically disabled person. She could face a year in prison.

Abuse: A Bronx woman was concerned by bruises on her grandmother's head so set up a hidden camera in her nursing home. She says she was shocked by the footage she recorded

The 89-year-old Alzheimer's sufferer had unexplained cuts and bruises on her head that caused her granddaughter to investigate

Valentin had noticed strange bruising on her grandmother's hand and forehead, and was unhappy with the explanations offered by the Gold Crest Care Center nursing home in the Bronx, New York City.

'They were telling me she had gotten the bruising on her hands by banging on the bed railing,' Valentin told ABC7.

Valentin was frustrated by the home's reaction to her complaints.

'Everytime I tried to go and complain they said "We know, it's going to be investigated."' she recalled to NBC.Â 

So the granddaughter hid a camera into a potted plant and recorded more 600 hours of video.

Accused: Sandra Kerr has been charged with endangering the welfare of a physically disabled person in her care

Returning the favor: Valentin has said she has a strong relationship with her grandmother: 'She basically took care of me. I was very close to her, so now it's my turn to take care of her.'

According to Valentin's attorney, footage from September 12, 2012, showed Kerr pushing the elderly woman into the metal railing of the bed.

Two days later the nurse's aide allegedly hit Medina twice in the side in the side of her body.

'The first video that I saw, she grabbed my grandmother's arm, twisted it back, lifted her off the bed and slammed her into the bed,' Valentin explained.

Kerr has been arrested and charged with three counts of willful violation of the public health law and three counts of endangering the welfare of an incompetent or physically disabled person.

She has since been released on her own recognizance.

Safe: The grandmother has now been relocated to a different nursing home

The video that Valentin recorded has not yet been released for legal reasons.

Medina is now safe, having been relocated to a different nursing home in New Rochelle.

Valentin told ABC she has a strong relationship with her grandmother: 'She basically took care of me. I was very close to her, so now it's my turn to take care of her.'

Gold Crest Care Center was been unavailable for comment.

But Valentin told reporters that the family is planning a future civil suit against the home and that three additional employees were fired because of the investigation into this case.
