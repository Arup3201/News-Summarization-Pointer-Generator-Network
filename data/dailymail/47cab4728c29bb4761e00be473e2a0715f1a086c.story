The man behind the voice of AOL’s famous ‘You’ve Got Mail’ slogan has been revealed, 25 years after he first recorded the famous saying.

Elwood Edwards, a TV editor from Cleveland, Ohio, was unmasked during The Today Show’s Throwback Thursday segment yesterday.

Mr Edwards says that he first recorded the slogan at home in 1989 with a cassette deck.

All smiles: While Mr Elwood would not disclose how much AOL paid him for his services, he says that they maintain a 'good relationship'

AOL users will also recognize him as the voice of the e-mail provider’s ‘file’s done,’ ‘welcome,’ and ‘goodbye’ exclamations.

When asked how much he had been paid for his work with AOL, Mr Edwards responded, smiling, ‘Let’s just say I have a good relationship with AOL.’

Mr Elwood's work for AOL was perhaps best immortalized through the 1998 film You've Got Mail, starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks.

The movie, which grossed more than $250million, shows Mr Hanks and Ms Ryan's characters fall in love over e-mail, with Mr Elwood's voice serving as a welcoming sign each time they log online.

He has worked for NBC’s Cleveland affiliate WKYC for the last 13 years as an editor, a position from which he just announced his retirement on Wednesday.

Flashback: Anyone who used AOL's e-mail services in the '90s is familiar with this sight, which would often be accessed along with the sound of Mr Elwood's voice

When asked what he wants to do now Mr Edwards said ‘I would love to do voiceovers right here,’ alluding to The Today Show’s location in New York City.

It sure seems like his resume would be cut out for it.
