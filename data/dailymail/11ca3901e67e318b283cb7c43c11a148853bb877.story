A mahogany boat believed to be part of a very limited series went down in the Sacramento River over the weekend.

Owner Alan Helmer told Fox40 that his sunken ship is  a Hunter boat from 1954. 

'There’s only two left in the world, and now there's - if this goes down, there’s only going to be one left in the world,' he said in an interview with the television station.

Wrecked: Alan Helmer's boat - which he says is a Hunter boat from 1954 - is seen in the Sacramento River

Limited edition: In total, 13 1954 Hunter boats were produced

Helmer's boat sank off of Sacramento, California on Sunday.

'She was gorgeous when I got her,' Helmer recalled. 

According to Helmer, thirteen 1954 Hunter boats were produced in total, but now only his and one other survive.

Rainfall that day led to the bilge pump being overwhelmed and also deluged the deck, Helmer told Fox40. Before the rain, the boat was using the bilge pump to stay on the water since it already had a small opening, he added.

The television station reported that one of Helmer's friends helped him fasten the boat with a skidoo and rope so it wouldn't move.

Sacramento resident James Jordan told Fox40 that the Sacramento River's water went up by approximately 15 feet from the storm.

'You know my buddy is a rice farmer, so this is definitely going to help them out,' he said.

Beloved: Alan Helmer has claimed that marinas have turned his boat away from parking there 

Jordan told Fox40 of the boat, 'We called 911 made sure there wasn't nobody on there, then we realized what boat it was.'

Jordan also said that '[Helmer] parked it here for about a month, and we came out here and asked him is there anyway you can move it, we can’t even cast on our own dock.

'It’s irresponsible of him to leave it unattended.'

'They just don't want you there,' Helmer told Fox40. 'A lot of marinas are just saying no wooden boats. Well that's our heritage. Our heritage - we're losing our heritage.'

'I don't know, this is a time when I don't want the rain,' Helmer also stated. 

Helmer said he will likely get the boat out Monday with the help of scuba gear and a lift bag.
