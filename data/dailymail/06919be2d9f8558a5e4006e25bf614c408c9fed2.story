A group of students were treated to 'most surreal night of our lives' after rapper Coolio cooked them  a three-course dinner and held a tequila-fuelled jam session until 4am at their rented house.

The students at the University of Central Lancashire had attended the American star's gig in the Preston and went to the after-party in a bar.

But after being invited into the VIP section, they struck up such a good rapport with the star whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr,  that he offered to cook to their house and cook them dinner.

Starstruck: As the group sat in the living room the award-winning rapper then began to encourage the students to sing along to an acoustic rendition of his most famous hit, Gangsta's Paradise

Claudia Doherty, aged 21, told Bolton News: 'A couple of us 
went to work as we didn’t think he would come because he was supposed to
be catching a flight.

'He came round and said he thought we were really 
cool people. We went to Tesco with him and people were recognising him.'

The group then went back to their student digs where Coolio, who has his own programme, Cookin’ with Coolio, he made his special 'chicken á la daaaam' as well as peach crumble for dessert.

As the group sat in the living room the award-winning rapper then began to encourage the students to sing along to an acoustic rendition of his most famous hit, Gangsta's Paradise.

Although the group were initially shy in the presence of the rapper who has sold more than 17 million albums worldwide, the 50-year-old's enthusiams proved infectious and they were soon siniging along. 

The six-minute performance of his 1995 hit was captured on camera and uploaded to YouTube.

The video description read: 'Met 
Coolio on a student night out in Preston and he said he wanted to cook 
for me and my house mates the following night and that’s exactly what 
happened. We decided to take a break from the cooking and have a jam 
session. Most surreal night of our lives! 4.15 is rapping at its best!'

A
Reddit user who claimed to be one of the group said: 'It was 
fascinating. He shared a lot of thoughts about his time with Tupac, 
including how he spoke with him the day he died. A lot of insight in to 
his upbringing and life on the streets.'

The
user added: 'He is pretty switched on. I not only learned how to 
sharpen a knife last night, but a lot of deep life lessons from Coolio. 
All whilst sipping from a bottle of Patron.'

Miss Doherty added: 'He was so down to earth,
he could have been one of my housemates.'

Lorcan O'Mahony, who accompanied the rapper on his guitar told the BBC he had 'conveniently left' it in the room when he heard the rapper was coming to the house.

'After dinner, I asked if he would perform Gangsta's Paradise and we all got involved.

'It is something I will never forget.'

He added that he had 'only learnt the chords a few hours earlier'.

Coolio left in the early hours of the morning to avoid missing his second flight to Zurich.

The rapper was arrested in Las Vegas in 2012 after car he was a passenger in a Nissan Versa which was pulled over for a routine traffic violation early Friday morning.

Police then ran Coolio's name in the their system and discovered that he had two active bench warrants out for his arrest stemming from multiple traffic violations.

As well as a stint on Big Brother in Britain, he also starred in US reality TV programme Coolio Rules which followed him trying to balance his life as a single parent, musician and running a catering business.
