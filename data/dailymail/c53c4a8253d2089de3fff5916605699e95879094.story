When it comes to expensive houses, it’s impossible to beat Buckingham Palace, the luxurious £1billion royal residence of British kings and queens.

But according to a new infographic, there’s a private house that’s not that far behind in terms of estimated value.

Owned by Mukesh Ambani, the richest man in India, his 'humble abode' in Mumbai, India, is worth £630m and takes the second place in the ranking of the world’s most expensive homes.

With facts about the luxurious properties - and their owners - the graph by Comparecamp.com reveals four London homes make the top 10 - as well as three in California, and one in France, New York, Montana, Monaco and Ireland.  

In fifth place is Lakshmi MIttal's mansion on Kensington Palace Gardens, valued at £140m. 

Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich bags ninth spot as his home, not far from Mittal on Billionaire's Row, comes in at £88m.

And scraping into the top ten is Elena Franchuk's property on Upper Phillimore Gardens, valued at a cool £81m.

As well as profiling the top ten most expensive homes in the world,  chat show queen Oprah Winfrey's £54m ($85m) mansion rules the category of the most expensive celebrity homes.
