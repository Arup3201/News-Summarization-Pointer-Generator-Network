A former Indian playboy is now living alone as a pauper in a mud hut after losing his fortune.

Raja Brajraj Kshatriya Birbar Chamupati Singh, Mahapatra of Tigiria, used to live a life of luxury in his palace with 30 servants.

But now aged 92 he relies on the kindness of villagers to bring him rice and lentils as he battles poverty.

The father of six is the last surviving former ruler in Orissa.

He married a princess and built up a fleet of luxury motors including 25 vintage luxury cars, reported The Daily Telegraph.

The couple have three sons and three daughters.

Previous life: He used to live of life of luxury in his palace with 30 servants

Change: Indian independence had a dramatic effect on his lavish lifestyle and he lost his state's tax revenues and was given a privy purse of £130 pounds a year instead

Pauper: After living with his brother for several years in 1987, he returned to Tigiria, built a hut and started living there

But Indian independence had a dramatic effect on his lavish lifestyle and Raja Jayant Madaraj, lost his 
state's tax revenues.

Instead he was given a privy purse of £130 pounds a year 
instead which did not support his glamorous outgoings.

He was forced to sell his palace in 1960 for £900 and later separated from his wife.

In 1975, the late prime minister Indira Gandhi withdrew the last remaining royal privileges and he lost his annual income.

Raja Jayant Madaraj left his hometown to live with his brother, although in 1987 he returned to Tigiria.

He built a hut and started living in the small abode on his own.

His wife, lives just a kilometre away, but the two have not met for decades.

But Raja Jayant Madara does not appear to be pining for his former life.

He told the Indian Express: 'Then I was the king. Now I am a pauper. But I have no regrets whatsoever. Do you think I would have been living so long if I were unhappy?'
