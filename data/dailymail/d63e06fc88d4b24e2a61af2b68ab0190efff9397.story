Deepening scandal: Paul Flowers was handed a £60,000 'golden goodbye' after he resigned, despite leading the bank to the brink of collapse

Disgraced former Co-operative Bank boss Paul Flowers was handed a £31,000 'golden goodbye' after he resigned, despite leading it to the brink of collapse, it was revealed today.

The Methodist minister, who was filmed allegedly buying crystal meth, crack cocaine and ketamine, was given a pay-off of the remainder of his £130,000 annual salary in June.

Now the bank is trying to claw back the cash and has ceased any further payments.

They will not confirm what the total payout is but have written to him to ask for the money back.

Their statement said: 'When Paul Flowers relinquished his responsibilities in June, it was agreed, as per his contractual obligations that his fees for the rest of his period of office would be paid.

'Following recent revelations, the Board stopped all payments with immediate effect and no further payments will be made. As previously stated, an internal fact-finding review is now under way.'

Flowers was chairman of the 'ethical' Co-op Bank from 2010 until May this year when he stepped down as it became clear the bank was on the path to losing £700million.

It came as it emerged that the Reverend was convicted of drink-driving in 1990, but just like after his conviction for gross indecency in 1981 he was forgiven by the church.

His Co-op pay-off was described a 'scandal' today and 'ill-deserved earnings' rewarded for 'incompetence and damage he has inflicted on the Co-op Bank, former Leeds MEP Michael  McGowan said.

The latest revelations surrounding Mr Flowers and the crisis-hit bank emerged as the Government indicated there would be an independent inquiry into how the Methodist minister - who has now been suspended indefinitely by his church -  came to be appointed in the first place.

Flowers is accused of buying and using illegal drugs including crystal meth, crack  cocaine and ketamine.

Police have searched his home as they 
investigate drugs offences. In recent days the Methodist has been hit 
with scandal after scandal.

Investigation: Police at the home of disgraced Mr Flowers today - he is being investigated by police for allegedly buying crystal meth and crack cocaine

While he was in charge of the Co-op he was setting up sex sessions with rent boys using his work email.

it also emerged that 32 years ago he was convicted of gross indecency 
after he was caught by police performing a sex act with a trucker in a 
public toilet.

He also 
resigned as a Labour councillor in Bradford in 2011 after 'inappropriate
but not illegal adult content' was found on a computer he used, the 
city council said.

It
has now been revealed Rev Flowers was caught drunk at the wheel in 
Manchester in June 1990, after celebrating his 40th birthday.

It is believed he was later banned from the roads after appearing before magistrates in the city. A spokeswoman for the Methodist Church said he had been allowed to continue his role in the church.

She
said: 'This was a matter for our usual procedures and after that 
process was complete it was decided he could continue as a minister. 
This matter did not preclude him from his activities in the church. He was very contrite, and he continued his work.'
