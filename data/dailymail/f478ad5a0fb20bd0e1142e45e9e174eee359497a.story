Former BBC director general Mark Thompson became embroiled in a row with a TV news crew when they tried to question him about his handling of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

Mr Thompson, 56, who next month faces a grilling from MPs over huge pay-offs to executives during his eight-year tenure, was confronted by a Channel 4 News team outside his luxury apartment block in New York.

According to a witness, Mr Thompson – who has been chief executive of the New York Times since November – lost his temper and ‘screamed’ at the team, who pursued him along the street.

‘He was tense and angry and was 
talking very loudly. They followed him around the corner and he lost his
 temper and shouted at them. It really caused a scene,’ the source told 
the New York Post.

Since leaving the corporation in 
September last year, Mr Thompson has faced growing pressure to explain 
exactly what he knew and when about the Savile scandal. 

He has repeatedly claimed he had no 
knowledge that the BBC’s Newsnight programme had been investigating 
claims Savile had sexually abused children – an investigation that was 
controversially scrapped.

An independent review by former Sky 
News chief Nick Pollard blamed ‘chaos and confusion’ at the top of the 
BBC but accepted Mr Thompson’s claims absolving himself of blame.

However, it has since emerged that 
former BBC director of news Helen Boaden told Mr Pollard she had warned 
Mr Thompson about the contents of the Newsnight investigation nine 
months before he left the corporation.

A spokesman for the New York Times 
denied Mr Thompson had lost his temper, saying he had to raise his voice
 to be heard over the traffic, and blamed the reporter instead.

He said: ‘It was the interviewer who lost his temper, so much so that the producer had to stop the filming.’

Channel 4 News said it did not 
discuss its projects but insiders confirmed Mr Thompson had been 
confronted as part of a planned investigation about Savile.

Mr Thompson has also faced criticism 
over Savile from his new employer. Senior Times columnist Joe Nocera 
questioned Mr Thompson’s explanation of his role in the affair, saying 
it made him appear ‘wilfully ignorant’ .
