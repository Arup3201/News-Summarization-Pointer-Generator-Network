French First Lady Carla Bruni fears her husband could 'drop dead through overwork' if he wins a second five-year term as President.

Bruni told viewers on live TV that 56-year-old Nicolas Sarkozy's '20-hour working days' and 'unimaginable sense of duty' could eventually kill him.

The former supermodel, 44, said: 'I'm afraid for him. I'm afraid for his health.

Sense of duty: French First Lady Carla Bruni mops her husband Nicolas Sarkozy's brow as they visit a market in Fort-de-France in January. She fears he could work himself to death

Workaholic: Sarkozy and Bruni meet David Cameron and his wife, Samantha, outside 10 Downing Street on an official visit in June 2010. Bruni says her husband pushes himself too hard

'It might seem crazy, but because he gives so much of himself he doesn't look after himself at all.

'He has an unimaginable sense of duty that he brings home to the house in the evenings, which is there all the time.

'He never stops, he never lets up, he works all the time. He works, I don't know, 20 hours a day.

'So I'm frightened that he'll die, all of a sudden, because he's pushing himself too hard.'

Bruni said last year that she believed a single term in office was enough for her 'superhuman husband', who has already had one health scare during his first term in office.

He is now bidding for a second term as president in the election in May.

Bruni added during the interview on France 5 television today: 'I realise it's part of the job, but I don't think everyone would do what he does. Few people have his energy.'

In a interview earlier this week, Sarkozy vowed to quit politics if he loses the election in two months' time.

He told listeners on RMC radio: 'I'll do something else, although what, I don't know what yet. But I will fight with all my energy to have the French people renew their confidence in me.'

A month earlier, the French leader said he would 'rather become a monk' than return to politics if he does not win.

Asked about her husband's plans to quit if he is defeated, Bruni added: 'What do you expect him to do after being President of France? Become a minister again? Become a mayor?

'He just couldn't. He'd have to leave politics.'

Sarkozy's last health scare was in July 2009 when he was rushed to hospital after collapsing while jogging.

Doctors conducted neurological, blood and cardiological tests before stating he had been suffering from 'extreme fatigue'.

The French media and Sarkozy's close friends all suggested at the time that it was his gruellling fitness regime encouraged by Bruni that lead to the collapse.

She put him on a strict diet after their marriage in 2008 and introduced him to her fitness instructor, who told him to lose 9lb and two trouser sizes - which some doctors said was excessive in a man who is only 5ft 5ins tall.

His close friend and MP Patrick Balkany said the regime made the president look like 'a Tour de France cyclist'.
