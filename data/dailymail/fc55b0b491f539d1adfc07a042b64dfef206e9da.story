Manchester United defender Jonny Evans is adamant Louis Van Gaal's Old Trafford revolution will soon see his side back at their entertaining best.

Van Gaal's tactics have come under fire from some United fans who are keen to see him revert back to the tried-and-tested 4-4-2 formation.

And United midfielder Adnan Januzaj admitted this week that Van Gaal's system often made it 'more difficult for me to play'.

But Van Gaal's resolute defence of his methods is starting to pay dividends, with the club up to third in the Premier League and FA Cup favourites after Wednesday night's fourth-round replay win over Cambridge.

Evans said: 'I think when you get as many attacking players on the pitch as we've got you are always going to entertain.

'But the manager has done a lot of work in trying to steady the team and making sure everyone knows their jobs. Once we get that nailed on, and everyone knows their defensive jobs, then I think we'll be able to push on from that and be really entertaining again.

'You can look at the formation changes and the personnel changes as well, plus the fact that there's a lot of players who haven't played together before, and he [the manager] is doing fantastically well in getting us organised. And as players we're really benefiting from that.'

Evans, who made his United debut in 2007, insists it is inevitable the squad will take time to fully adapt to Van Gaal's methods following the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson and the tumult of David Moyes' brief and unsuccessful regime.

'I think the lads have taken a lot on board,' added Evans.

'At times it has been tough and it takes time. We've been used to playing a certain way for a number of years, then the change happens and he wants us to play a certain way.

'So it does take time for those things to become second nature. But I think you are starting to see that now.'

Shock defeats for Chelsea and Manchester City have left United as the highest-ranked team left in the FA Cup

United may have limped past lowly Cambridge at the second attempt but Evans thinks it could spell the start of the club's first FA Cup triumph since 2004.

Shock defeats for Chelsea and Manchester City have left United as the highest-ranked team left in the competition, giving Van Gaal a superb chance of capping his first season in charge with a major trophy.

Evans said: 'Our record in the FA Cup hasn't been good over the last few years.

'It's an old cliche that you want to win everything but it is such a historic trophy, especially for Manchester United, and the fact that the league is still not gone but not looking likely, the FA Cup looks our best chance of a trophy, especially considering some of the teams that have gone out.

'We're the highest ranked team left in the competition now. It was a bit of a shock sitting at home hearing the news that Chelsea and City had gone out. But we know from our own experiences all about upsets.'
