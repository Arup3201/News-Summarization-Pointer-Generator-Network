British student Melisa Kenber said she was sprayed with tear gas as she tried to film the demonstrations

A British student was chased by Turkish riot police wielding tear gas after she began to film anti-government protests.

Melisa Kenber, 19, of Ripon, North Yorkshire, had been visiting family in Istanbul when she became caught up in the riots.

As she started to video the police they yelled, 'No pictures, no pictures,' and ran after her until she reached her car, her eyes streaming from the gas.

The former head-girl, who was by herself in the square, said she was left in agony with red, raw eyes after being chased by riot police back to her car.

She arrived in the country amid some of the biggest protests in Turkey for years.

Tens of thousands of Turks have joined anti-government protests over the past four days expressing discontent with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan's 10-year rule.

The demonstrations were sparked by the heavy-handed police response to a protest in Taksim Square on Friday against a new development.

It has since spread across the country as secular Turks voice their anger against perceived authoritarian policies, including the promotion of headscarves for women and tightening of alcohol laws.

Miss Kenber said she could sense the tensions as soon as she arrived in the country, where she stayed with her grandmother.

She said: 'I go to Istanbul every year but this time I went, before it all kicked off, I had never hear people so frustrated and angry and complain about the government.

'It was like a bomb waiting to go off. The final straw was at Taksim Square.

'There were thousands of people there, listening to bands and talking, it was a really nice atmosphere.

'But just before dawn police arrived with canisters of gas and water bombs.'

Miss Kenber, who is due to study medicine at Leeds University in September, said she heard accounts of what happened from family living nearby.

But she saw events for herself when she was caught up in clashes trying to reach the airport to return to the UK on Saturday morning.

Miss Kenber said she wishes she could have joined the protests for longer but had booked her flight in advance.

She told Mail Online: 'I was scared at that moment but glad at the same time.

'I am guessing it was tear gas. I was crying and my eyes were so red. It was difficult to breathe.

'It felt like I was inhaling pepper.'

She said she went to Taksim Square to see if she could catch a bus as the police had closed off many of the roads.

She said: 'There was tear gas everywhere. I ran up to the square and there were hundreds of police buses.

'There were burnt advertising boards on the building sites and rubble and broken glass everywhere.

'The police had completely blocked off the park so nobody could leave.

'I decided to video the policemen and they started shouting, "No pictures, no pictures".

'And
then they started chasing me. I just ran off and got straight back in 
the car. My eyes were so red and tears were streaming down my face from 
the gas.'

Miss Kenber said the tension in Istanbul was palpable from when she landed before the protests began

The police have been heavily criticised for their heavy--handed response to peaceful protest. This picture of academic Ceyna Sungar has been shared across the globe

The police have been heavily criticised for their heavy-handed response to peaceful protest.

A picture of academic Ceyna Sungar being doused in pepper spray has been shared across the world as used as a galvanising force for further demonstrations.

Miss Kenber, whose parents are Turkish, said the majority of the protesters are educated people who are fighting for their rights.

She said: 'I am glad something is being done. I don't think the country will ever be the same again.'

Turkey's deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc yesterday offered an apology for the violent crackdown on an environmental protest, in a bid to appease the days of anti-government rallies as hundreds of riot police were deployed around the prime minister's office in the capital.

The Turkish Human Rights Association said 3,300 people nationwide were detained during the four days of protests.

At least 1,300 people were injured and a 22-year-old man died during a protest.

Turkey's state-run news agency says police have detained 25 people for 'spreading untrue information' on social media and provoking protests.

The Anadolu Agency said today they were detained in the city of Izmir for allegedly 'inciting the people to enmity and hate.' It said police were still looking for 13 others.

Mr Aric described the crackdown as 'wrong and unjust' but Mr Erdogan, who is out of the country, has previously described protestors as 'looters' and dismissed the protests as acts by fringe extremists.

A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said they were advising British nationals to avoid all demonstrations.
