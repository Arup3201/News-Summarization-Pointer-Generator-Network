The Houston Texans beefed up their defensive line by taking extraordinary pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney from the University of South Carolina with the first pick of the 2014 NFL draft on Thursday.

The Texans, picking first after a league-worst 2-14 season, kicked off the annual selection party at Radio City Music Hall by taking defensive end Clowney to partner two-time All-Pro DE JJ Watt, the league Defensive Player of the Year in 2012.

'I'm going to do everything I can to help the program,' said Clowney, who registered 24 sacks and 130 tackles in three seasons and became the first sophomore to win the Hendricks Award as the nation's most outstanding defensive end.

'To be the No 1 pick is the greatest feeling in the world.'

Commissioner
 Roger Goodell was subjected to some jeering as he officially opened the
 draft, which produces the primary pool of talent for NFL teams as well 
as plenty to cheer and boo for thousands of fans in attendance decked 
out in team jerseys.

Clowney
 was the first of 32 picks in the first round of the draft. Rounds two 
and three will be held on Friday with the last four rounds conducted on 
Saturday in the three-day extravaganza.

A
 freakish athlete, Clowney, who stands 6-feet-5 (1.96 m) and weighs 266 
pounds (121 kg), stunned observers at the NFL Scouting Combine in 
February by running a blistering 4.53 seconds in the 40-yard dash - a 
time better than many of the wide receivers tested.

The
 St Louis Rams used the second pick of the draft to take Auburn 
offensive tackle Greg Robinson, with the Jacksonville Jaguars grabbing 
quarterback Blake Bortles of Central Florida University with the third 
choice.

Rebuilding programme: Khalil Mack, touted by some as a possible No 1 pick, is a versatile linebacker who will help stuff the run, rush the passer and drop into coverage

Jacksonville's selection of Bortles seemed to stun the crowd,
 many of whom had anticipated that Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel would 
be the first quarterback taken in the draft.

The first trade of the 
draft sent Cleveland's pick to the Buffalo Bills, who used the fourth 
pick to take dynamic wide receiver Sammy Watkins of Clemson.

In 
return, the Browns got Buffalo's first-round pick, number nine overall, 
as well as the Bills' first-round choice in 2015 and their fourth-round 
pick next year.

Hard-hitting linebacker Khalil Mack from the 
University of Buffalo was taken fifth by the Oakland Raiders ahead of 
offensive tackle Jake Matthews of Texas A&M, the latest member of 
his illustrious NFL family to join the league.

Matthews will be the 
seventh member of the clan to play in the league following his 
grandfather Clay Matthews Sr., his father Bruce Matthews, uncle Clay 
Matthews Jnr, and cousins Clay Matthews III and Casey Matthews, and 
brother Kevin Matthews.

'It's been my dream since I was a kid,' the 
Falcons player said before being asked about his famed football family. 'That's some big shoes to fill. I'm just so proud to have this last 
name, and excited to be on the Atlanta Falcons.'

Come in No 7: Mike Evans was taken by Tampa Bay to form a fearsome-looking pairing with Vincent Jackson

Cleveland kept their
 trading cap on, sending a fifth-round pick to Minnesota to move from 
ninth to eighth spot and select cornerback Justin Gilbert after the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected towering wide receiver Mike Evans from 
Texas A&M.

Minnesota followed by taking linebacker Anthony Barr 
out of UCLA before former Detroit Lions running back and Hall of Famer 
Barry Sanders announced that Detroit had selected tight end Eric Ebron 
from North Carolina to round out the top 10 picks.

Finally, a local team was on the clock and the audience approved lustily when the Giants chose LSU receiver Odell Beckham Jnr.

Beckham was followed by Pitt DT Aaron Donald to St Louis, Virginia Tech CB Kyle Fuller to Chicago, Ohio State LB Ryan Shazier to Ohio State, Notre Dame G Zack Martin to Dallas, Alabama LB CJ Mosley to Baltimore and, as fans chanted 'J-E-T-S,' Louisville safety Calvin Pryor is New York-bound.
