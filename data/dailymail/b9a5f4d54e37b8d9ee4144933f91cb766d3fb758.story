The bicycle at the centre of the ‘plebgate’ row that cost former Tory Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell his job has sold for £10,600 on eBay.

The money will go to a charity that helps HIV and Aids-affected children in Kenya.

Mr Mitchell was riding the seven-year-old Reflex Westminster when police refused to let him leave Downing Street via the main gate last September.

It was claimed that he swore at officers and called them ‘plebs’. He denies this but was forced to resign.

With four days until the auction end, the bike had already attracted more than £1,000 in bids, from a starting bid of £200

Mr Mitchell put the Reflux Westminster bicycle on eBay, saying he wanted to give it 'a good home out of the limelight'.

The 18-speed two-wheeler, complete with front basket, first attracted a bid of £200. Four days before the auction ended, it had eight bids at a total of £1,020.

But the price shot up in the final days of bidding, with the winning anonymous bid at the close of the auction on Thursday evening standing at £10,600.

Mr Mitchell - who strenuously denies the allegation that he called the Downing Stree police officers 'plebs'- was forced to resign after a series of damaging headlines

Scotland Yard are investigating the Downing Street dispute in the wake of a Channel 4 investigation which cast doubt on the original account of the incident.

The programme revealed CCTV footage which showed there was not a large group of tourists outside the main gate at the time, as had originally been claimed.

An email from a civilian witness backing up the police account of events has also since been called into question.
