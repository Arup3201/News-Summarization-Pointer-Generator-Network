Online purchases on a new debit card for children have been suspended after The Mail on Sunday exposed how it can be used to buy alcohol, pornography and weapons.

Launched last month, Osper is marketed at users aged eight to 18.

The company says its product – which is endorsed by Davina McCall and has the backing of MasterCard – promotes safe spending by harnessing the ‘highest level of security currently available for under-18s’.

But The Mail on Sunday has found that the card – which, after 12 months costs £10 a year – can be used to buy age-restricted items online. It can also be used in a pub.

Online transactions have now been suspended and TV presenter Ms McCall last night said: ‘I’m hugely thankful that The MoS has flagged this up and that Osper is already proactively dealing with the issue.’

The card has to be ordered by a parent or guardian who pre-loads it with funds for their child to use. It can also be used in a cash machine.

The parent has access to an app which provides a number of safety features unique among debit cards for children. 

Osper claims it is ‘the safest way to allow young people to spend online, with built-in limits and controls that block purchases from over-18 sites’. 

But, using a card registered to an eight-year-old, our reporter was able to make a number of shocking purchases – most disturbingly, accessing a Dutch website offering ‘one-on-one’ interaction with live sex webcams, for £8.11.

It was also used at Amazon which, for £14.95, sent the sexually explicit film Nymphomaniac and the violent, 16-certificate computer game Call Of Duty: Ghosts, for £16.11.

Other online transactions included a £24.95 two-inch blade from SwissTool.co.uk, and a £7.98 tube of Loctite super glue from B&Q.

It was also used to buy alcohol in a pub.

The legal responsibility for verifying the age of a customer for an adult product lies with retailers, not a card company.

Last night Marion King, of MasterCard, said: ‘When made aware of this issue, we insisted all e-commerce transactions on Osper cards be suspended immediately and expect this issue to be addressed as a matter of urgency.’

And Osper chief executive Alick Varma said: ‘All new and existing Osper parents will be asked to proactively “opt in” if they would like their child to be able to use their Osper Card for online purchases.

'As part of this process, we will clearly communicate to parents the potential risks involved with allowing their children to buy things online.’
