Salmon were spotted swimming upstream on a flooded road in Washington State after a swollen river overflowed from severe rains.

The fish glided along, oblivious to cars that maneuvered slowly down the water-filled street, but an opportunistic dog on the prowl snapped up one of the lost fresh water creatures.

Video footage from KOMO-TV shows the canine snatch the salmon and calmly carry it out of the raging waters.

Flooding on the streets in Union, Washington was caused when the nearby Skokomish River overflowed due to heavy rain falls in the nearby Olympic Mountains.

The mountain range is located in western Washington and is part of the Pacific Coast Ranges.

The western slopes of the Olympics, near where the Hoh Rainforest is located, are one of the wettest areas in the continental U.S., receiving 140 and 170 inches of rainfall each year.
