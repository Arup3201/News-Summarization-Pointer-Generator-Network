With its 200 acres complete with lakes, formal gardens and a riding school, Rydinghurst is a world away from the cramped terraces of working class Liverpool where Ringo Starr grew up.

But the estate, near Cranleigh, Surrey, which The Beatles drummer bought in 1999 for £2million, will go up for sale this week and is expected to fetch as much as ten times that amount.

The Grade-II listed Jacobean mansion offers a glimpse into the luxury lifestyle of Mr Starr, 74 - one quarter of the world’s most successful music group - who redesigned the estate after buying it with his wife, former Bond girl Barbara Bach, 67, from Count George Bardeau.

Nicky Haslam, the celebrity interior designer who helped the couple redesign the house, said: ‘We took it back practically to bare walls, and it was terrific fun to do.

‘I had to employ specialist plasterers, and Ringo loves all that kind of English craftsmanship. He was very hands on and can read plans, which few clients can do.

‘I was given pretty much free rein with the décor, but Ringo wanted a music room for his gold records and drum kits, and there’s another big music room, more like a ballroom, for performing.

‘There’s a wonderful kitchen, as they both like to cook and have specific food requirements. It had to be big enough to eat in, and there’s a pretty herb garden just outside.’

He added: ‘We did the pool house two years later. They didn’t leave anything undone – the garden is beautiful. Ringo certainly likes a plant or two, though I can’t say I actually ever saw him with a space in his hand, spreading manure.’

Swimming pool: Mr Starr and Miss Bach are selling 17th century Rydinghurst as they rarely find time to stay in the property

Time to say goodbye: The move ends a nearly five-decade association of Surrey with The Beatles, which began in 1965

Mr Starr and Miss Bach are selling 17th century Rydinghurst – which boasts its own cinema, entrance lodge, cottage, coach house, indoor pool, gym, paddock, helipad and stables on top of the six bedrooms and six reception rooms – as they rarely find time to stay in the property, mainly living between their flat off the King’s Road in London and in America.

'We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there'

They told The Sunday Times: ‘We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there. It is a beautiful home with some very special features, but we are, reluctantly, unable to spend as much time there as we would wish.

‘With commitments in American and our family all in England, we will continue to divide our time between Los Angeles and London.’

The draw of California is reportedly two-fold for the couple, who have five children between them, all from previous relationships.

The first is work commitments. Mr Starr - who was born Richard Starkey and has an estimated wealth of £170million - still tours with his All Starr Band and both he and his wife are heavily involved with charities.

He said recently: ‘I’m really into the healthy lifestyle that they have out in LA. I do yoga every day and eat healthily. I’m obsessed with broccoli – I eat it with absolutely everything. It’s become a running joke. My wife makes fun of me for it. Broccoli is my secret to looking young.’

The move ends a nearly five-decade association of Surrey with The Beatles, which began in 1965 when their manager, Brian Epstein, decided they should all live close to each other and away from the prying eyes of the press.

Although, Paul McCartney decided to stay in London, 30 miles away from Rydinghurst.

Despite saying goodbye to the country, Mr Starr recently reaffirmed his love for the area, when he said: ‘When you've grown up around the dusty back streets of Liverpool, you don't ever expect to end up comfortable and settled in the leafy surrounds of Surrey, but it's a beautiful place'.

Despite this, he has been preparing to sell the property since early this year and it will be put on the market by luxury estate agents Knight Frank.
