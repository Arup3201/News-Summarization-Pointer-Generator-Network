Floyd Mayweather Jnr has challenged Amir Khan to prove he deserves a fight when the British boxer faces Devon Alexander on Saturday night.

Khan has been calling for a bout with Mayweather in the next year if he defeats Alexander in Las Vegas this week, but Mayweather has not yet accepted the challenge.

And Mayweather claims he can't accept fights with every boxer that claims they deserve a shot at his world titles, or his career would go on another three decades.

Khan remains keen to fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in 2015 if he beats Alexander

'I know Khan has been saying that if he beats Devon Alexander that he deserves a fight with me,' he said. 

'But if I gave a fight to every fighter out there who claimed he deserved one - I would be fighting into my 60's.'

Mayweather also insisted Khan would have to prove himself in the ring before he can claim to be on the same level as the five-division world champion.

The undefeated champion has told Khan to prove himself in the ring rather than by just talking

'He has been talking big,' added Mayweather. 'Saying if he wins then he should be talked about in the same breath as me. 

'I like the fact the kid has confidence - but I don't take much notice of words like that. I do all my talking in the ring - maybe he should do the same. 

'I have not decided on my next fight yet - and nobody's big words is going to affect my decision. All I will say is I will be watching Amir with interest on Saturday.'
