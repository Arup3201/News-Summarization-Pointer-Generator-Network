Kurt Zouma's Chelsea career got off to a flying start on Wednesday night when the 19-year old scored on his debut, but's it not just his goal that has got people talking.

The French centre back scored the opener in a2-1 win against Bolton in the Capital One Cup, but something catching people's eye just as much is his full name - Kurt Happy Zouma.

Born in Lyon, France, Zouma takes his first name from a film character played by Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme.

Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Kurt Sloane, who must must learn the ancient kick boxing art of Muay Thai in order to avenge his brother, who was paralysed by a rival during a fight. 

The 1989 film is considered a cult classic.

His parents, evidently fans of the 1989 movie Kickboxer, named their son after the star, 'Kurt Sloane'. Zouma explained the revelance to Chelseafc.co.uk:

'In the film, he helps everyone and is super strong,' the France U21 defender revealed. 'So my parents decided that if they gave me that name I'd be hard and always have a smile. Apparently it worked.'

And that certainly seemed the case on Wednesday night, as Zouma's smile stretched from ear to ear during the celebrations for his goal.

The youngster joined Chelsea in January 2014 for £12million, but was immediately loaned back to his selling club Saint-Etienne for the remainder of the season.

Another quirk in Zouma's profile is his middle name - Happy. In some African culture, it is common practice to relate middle names to virtues, and the defender will certainly have been happy after his goal and a win on his debut.
