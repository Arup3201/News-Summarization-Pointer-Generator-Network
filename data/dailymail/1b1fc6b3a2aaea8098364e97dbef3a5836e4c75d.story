Roman Abramovich believed it was his ‘moral obligation’ to hand fellow Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky £1.3billion to fund his lavish lifestyle, a court heard today.

The Chelsea owner gave his former friend the cash because he felt it was part of the ‘code of honour’ that had replaced the rule of law in Russia after the collapse of communism, it was alleged.

Mr Abramovich had used the well-connected Mr Berezovsky as his ‘political godfather’ to help him conduct business deals in a country where police were ‘corrupt’ and courts ‘open to manipulation, the High Court was told.

The money he paid Mr Berezovsky 
funded the 65-year-old’s exuberant expenses which included ‘palaces in 
France, private aircraft, jewels for his girlfriends, valuable painting 
at Sotheby's,’ it was claimed.

The allegations were made at the 
second day of the extraordinary legal battle between the two Russian 
oligarchs which is costing an estimated £50 per second.

Mr Berezovsky is suing his former 
friend Mr Abramovich for £3.2billion claiming he ‘betrayed and 
blackmailed’ him over the sale of shares in Russian oil giant Sibneft 
and intimidated him into getting rid of them at a fraction of their 
value.

Jonathan Sumption QC for Mr 
Abramovich today told the court that the claims of bullying were ‘wholly
unfounded’ and that Mr Berezovsky had never been had never been the 
registered owner of shares in Sibneft.

Reporters crowd round Boris Berezovsky who is claiming Mr Abramovich 'intimidated' him into selling shares in Russian oil company Sibneft at a fraction of their value

But he said that Mr Abramovich 
accepted he owed Mr Berezovsky ‘a debt of honour’ for using his 
political influence to allow him to get control of the oil company, 
which is why he gave him the money.

Mr Abramovich required a ‘political 
godfather’ because of the ‘quite extraordinary conditions’ in Russia 
following the fall of the communist regime in 1992, the QC said.

He chose Mr Berezovsky because he had
a ‘close relationship’ with people in the ‘immediate circle’ of then 
Russian president Boris Yeltsin.

‘Mr Berezovsky was a power broker, he
turned from business to political purely because of the difficulties of
running a business without power,’ Mr Sumption said.

‘For substantial cash payments, Mr Abramovich and Sibneft would enjoy Mr Berezovsky's political patronage.’

He said  Mr Yeltsin agreed to the ‘corrupt deal’ in return for the backing of Mr Berezovksy's powerful media empire.

Turning point: It is alleged Mr Abramovich betrayed Mr Berezovsky after the latter fell out of favour with political leaders at the Kremlin, then led by President Vladimir Putin (above)

Mr Sumption said that, without Mr Berezovsky's ‘considerable influence’, Mr Abramovich ’would have got nowhere’.

But the QC said that Mr Berezovsky 
kept demanding more after brokering the deal and by the end of the 1990s
expected all his personal expenses to be met by Mr Abramovich's 
companies.

‘He sought what he could get . As Sibneft prospered Mr Berezovsky demanded more.’

Laurence Rabinowitz QC, for Mr 
Berezovsky, earlier told the court that his client had been ‘betrayed’ 
by Mr Abramovich after falling out with Russian political leaders and 
leaving Russia in 2000 when Vladimir Putin became president.

But Mr Sumption said Mr Berezovsky 
had made ‘scurrilous... and unjustified allegations of criminal and 
improper conduct on the part of Mr Abramovich’.

Mr Abramovich, who is currently said 
to be worth £10.3billion, sold Sibneft to Russia’s state-owned gas 
monopoly six years ago in a multi-billion pound deal.

His lawyer denied he was ever a close friend of Mr Berezovsky but said there had been an ‘emotional bond’ between the pair.
