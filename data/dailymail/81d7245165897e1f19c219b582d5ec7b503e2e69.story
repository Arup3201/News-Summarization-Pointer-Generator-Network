The luxury home where Oscar Pistorius shot dead girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp has been sold for £250,000 - £100,000 less than the asking price.

The villa in a gated community in Pretoria had been on the market since March but has finally sold for 4.5million South African rand.

The Paralympian has never returned to the upmarket house since he fatally shot Steenkamp in an upstairs bathroom in the pre-dawn hours of February 14 last year.

It was confirmed that the 27-year-old, who is still on trial for murder, needed to sell the property to raise money for his legal bills, which total up to £5,000 per day.

According to the Times Live in South Africa, the buyer Louwtjie Louwrens, plans to retire to the property with his family.

He told the newspaper: 'It is in a safe area and everyone I dealt with was very professional.

'It stood empty for more than a year and there is some water damage, so we would first have to repair it.'

Since the shooting in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year, Pistorius has been living at his uncle's house in Pretoria.

During the trial, the court was also shown the property's staircase, which Pistorius is said to have carried Miss Steenkamp down

It is thought that the house remained sealed since it was handed back by police over a year ago.

Estate agent Ansie Louw, who was handling the sale said selling the property was an unusual process due to the situation.

She said: 'We were not allowed to take photos or put it onto our website. If they do open it they attract lots of people just interested in the case and it will be chaos.

'It is not normal circumstances. It is not a normal process. But you know what some people say it doesn't bother them.'

She also explained that there has been a lot of interest in the home since it went up for sale in March.

Pistorius valued the house at five million rand during his bail application in February last year.

At the time he also owned two other houses with a combined value of 1.5 million rand in Pretoria and a vacant plot worth 1.6 million rand in Cape Town.

All his properties together were worth 8.3 million rand, the sporting hero told the court.

Since the shooting he has lost many of the endorsement deals that earned him some £300,000 ($510,000) a year.

The athlete has been paying his own legal fees since the shooting, according to a statement released by his lawyers earlier this year

The costs - reportedly as high as £5,000 ($9,000) a day - are said to include at least three full-time lawyers in court, ballistics and forensics experts as well as an American crime scene reconstruction company.

Pistorius is charged with premeditated murder and faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted.

He says he shot Miss Steenkamp, 29, by mistake through a locked door in his bathroom because he thought she was a dangerous night time intruder.
