She is yet to make her screen debut, but Cressida Bonas already appears to be completely at home at the glitzy Hollywood parties of the awards season.

Prince Harry’s former girlfriend, 25, was seen mixing with the movie world’s A-list as part of the British contingent in Los Angeles ahead of the Golden Globes last night.

Her first film, Tulip Fever, is due out later this year. It is being produced by influential movie mogul Harvey Weinstein, who has been singing the aspiring actress’s praises.

But she seems to have more than her career on her mind, with reports that she has begun a relationship with actor Freddie Fox, 26, son of Day Of The Jackal star Edward Fox and actress Joanna David.

Miss Bonas was first spotted with Fox, star of recent film Riot Club, at a West End screening of Tim Burton’s movie Big Eyes.

And they were together in Los Angeles at celebrity hot-spot Chateau Marmont on Saturday, posing arm in arm at a pre-Golden Globes dinner, where Miss Bonas was also pictured with Downton Abbey stars Joanne Froggatt and Laura Carmichael.

Miss Bonas, who dated Prince Harry for two years until last spring, stars alongside model Cara Delevingne as well as Oscar-winners Dame Judi Dench and Christoph Waltz in Tulip Fever, but Weinstein has singled her out as one to watch. 

He said: ‘Cressida is great and people will see what a fantastic actress she is. It will be the first of many roles for her.’

He praised her for not trying to use her fame to secure roles, saying: ‘She is not taking advantage of any media profile.’

Tulip Fever, adapted by Sir Tom Stoppard from the novel by Deborah Moggach, is set in the 17th century and sees an artist fall in love with a young woman after her husband commissions him to paint her portrait. Miss Bonas plays Mrs Steen, the young wife of a merchant.

Earlier she dazzled in white at a BAFTA Tea Party, joining Cara Delevingne, Keira Knightley and the ladies of hit TV show Downton Abbey as they partied in the sunshine town.
