Antonio Valencia's absence from Manchester United's squad for the New Year's Day clash against Stoke was because of a thigh strain.

The Ecuador star was replaced by Rafael at half-time as Louis van Gaal's side drew 0-0 with Tottenham at White Hart Lane last Sunday.

Valencia has emerged as United's first-choice right back under Van Gaal and had started the previous 10 Premier League games.

The extent of the injury and the length of time Valencia will be missing is not yet known, but Van Gaal will hoping it is not serious as the Dutchman has lost faith in Brazilian right back Rafael, who was left on the bench for the clash at the Britannia.

It is a position that United are prioritising in the January transfer window.

The injury will irk the former Holland manager further after the 63-year-old has vented his frustration at the number of fixtures during the traditionally busy festive period.

Ahead of the New Year's Day clash Van Gaal told Sky Sports: 'You cannot recover your body. That's my opinion, but it's also scientifically proven. I don't think you have to do that to the players.'

The United boss was echoing his complaints made on Tuesday where he insisted the players' safety was being jeopardised by the quick turnaround of fixtures.

'Everybody knows that a body cannot recover within 48 hours.

A frustrated Van Gaal makes a point to the fourth official during the match at White Hart Lane on Sunday

'Therefore, there is a rule at UEFA and FIFA that you cannot play the games so close. OK, that I have said.

'That’s scientifically proven, I have said that also. Everybody knows that and in spite of that, we have to play.

'It’s the culture of England. I don’t mind but it is not good for the players, for the health of the players and what I say now is it is not good for the game because I think that the FA, but also the fans, want attractive games.'
