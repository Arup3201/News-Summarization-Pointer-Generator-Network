With Roy Hodgson's squad preparing for their third Euro 2016 qualifier against Estonia, Sportsmail takes a closer look at the Three Lions' next opponents. 

England have played Estonia just twice - during the Euro 2008 qualifying campaign - but have an aggregate scoreline of 6-0 after two 3-0 wins. 

In June 2007 Steve McClaren's side beat them in Tallinn thanks to goals from Joe Cole, Peter Crouch and Michael Owen before Shaun Wright-Phillips, Wayne Rooney and an own goal helped them to a win at Wembley four months later.

Estonia have kept just six clean sheets in their last 20 games, but they do not concede too many goals. They let in an average of 1.2 per game in those 20 matches and conceded more than two goals in just one game - a 5-1 thrashing by Hungary in 2013.

The A. Le Coq Arena in Tallinn where England will play tomorrow is named after Estonia's biggest beer company, but in its early years in the 19th Century the company was actually run from London.

Estonia's FIFA world ranking is 81. That's 63 places worse than England in 18th, but 127 places higher than San Marino, who are the joint-worst ranked side, along with Bhutan.

Several England players and fans are likely to be calling home from Estonia this weekend using online video service Skype. The company was in fact created by Estonian software developers in Tallinn.

Despite Estonia's lowly world ranking, it won't be all easy for England. The hosts have won four and drawn four of their last 10 home games. They have lost just twice, a 2-0 defeat by Turkey in 2013 and a 2-0 loss to Finland earlier this year.
