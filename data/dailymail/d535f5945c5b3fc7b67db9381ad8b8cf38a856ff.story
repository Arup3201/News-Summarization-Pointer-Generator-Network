Deontay Wilder is the real deal.

It might not have been the stunning knockout victory many had predicted, but the 6ft 7in giant from Alabama was crowned the new heavyweight champion of the world on Saturday night.

He produced a composed and mature performance against Bermane Stiverne in Las Vegas to win the WBC title and add substance to a career hitherto laden with hype.

Wilder, who had knocked out each of his previous 32 opponents before the fifth round, twice had Stiverne in trouble but was unable to find the finish while the Haitian struggled to stamp his authority on the fight.

The judges were all in agreement, scoring the fight 118-109, 119-108 and 120-107 to Wilder.

It was the first heavyweight title fight at the MGM Grand since Mike Tyson bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear 18 years ago.

Both Tyson and Holyfield were on hand to watch, as was Larry Holmes, who fought often on the big stage as heavyweight champion in the 1970s and 80s.

And Wilder became the first American to hold a piece of the heavyweight title since Shannon Briggs reigned briefly in 2007 and 2008.

The challenger controlled the opening stages of the first round, boxing on his back foot but using his rod-like jab to good effect. Stiverne was happy to stalk his taller opponent around the ring but was reluctant to let his hands go until the final seconds.

One of the biggest questions before the fight was Wilder's ability to take a punch but he was untroubled by a left hook to the head in the second round.

The challenger was in control as the clock ticked down before he suddenly unleashed a barrage of shots. The bell sounded as Stiverne slipped to the canvas and although no knockdown was called, the Haitian was rocked.

The champion took his time to warm into the third stanza as Wilder kept him at range with his long left hand. Stiverne did land a couple of body shots midway through but was otherwise a virtual bystander as Wilder dropped his hands, smiled and taunted his rival.

But the champion looked more comfortable in the fourth round, closing the gap and landing with a solid left hook. He finished strongly to notch his first session of the night.

Wilder was by now in uncharted territory and he sensibly returned to boxing behind his jab. With a minute remaining, however, he unleashed his right hand and wobbled Stiverne but the champion showed his mettle to remain on his feet and the attack fizzled out.

And it was Stiverne who enjoyed his best round of the fight as it approached the halfway stage. A left hook to the head stunned Wilder against the ropes but he recovered quickly and flashed another grin.

If one thing was beyond doubt, it was Stiverne's ability to absorb a punch.

Midway through the seventh round, Wilder landed a stiff left-right combination which sent the champion staggering backwards. But he stayed upright and his chin soaked up another barrage of right hands.

Both men took a breather in the eighth stanza with Wilder retreating behind his jab and Stiverne restricted to the odd flurry.

Few had expected the fight to go the distance but after nine rounds, Wilder looked to be heading for a points victory. As he took to his stool, Stiverne was told he was 'miles behind' on the scorecards.

And the crowd began to jeer as Wilder remained content to keep the champion at range.

Both men were visibly tired in the penultimate session with neither able to launch a sustained attack.

Wilder's corner implored him to be smart as he sat three minutes away from claiming one of the greatest prizes in sport.

And he didn't let them down as he smothered Stiverne and celebrated in typically exuberant style, shouting into the camera as Muhammad Ali once did, perhaps fittingly on The Greatest's 73rd birthday.

Wilder was untroubled for large parts of the fight but when he was caught, showed he could take a punch

'I answered a lot of questions tonight,' he said. 'We knew we could go 12 rounds, we knew we could take a punch. All the hard work is done in camp. Did I look like I had fun? I really did.

'There wasn't a better opponent than Bermane Stiverne. I wanted to prove I could do it and I did that. I don't want anyone to doubt me anymore.

'I thought I was going to knock him out in four rounds but when I saw he could take a great punch, I knew I was in for a long fight.

'I want to bring excitement to the heavyweight division. I want to fight four times a year. I'm ready whenever.'

Stiverne claimed he was not at his best as he surrendered the title he won against Chris Arreola last year. 

'It wasn't my night,' he said. 'I didn't feel 100 per cent. I just couldn't cut the ring off or move my head like I usually do.

'I congratulate him but I've got to go back and learn from my mistakes.

'I was trying to throw combinations of four and five punches but I got through two of them.

'I was flat. This wasn't me at all. I wasn't able to do what I wanted to do.'
