Vivica A. Fox has defended Bill Cosby in light of his mounting rape allegations, saying: 'The man I met was nothing like the man they are describing.'

The actress joined a growing number of Cosby Show alumni who have come to the embattled comedian's defense as she appeared on The Meredith Vieira Show, which will air on Thursday.

Fox, 50, recalled how she worked with the actor - who has been accused of drugging and sexually assaulting more than two dozen women - on 'Cosby' for an episode in 1999.

'I worked on the Cosby show and was honored to do the show, and... the man I met was nothing like the man they are describing,' she said.

Defense: Actress Vivica A. Fox told Meredith Vieira that she stands by Bill Cosby, whom she called 'kind'

Support: She said when she worked with Cosby in the 90s, she witnessed nothing inappropriate

'He was nice, kind. There was no sexual overtones or anything so I defend him and I stand by him as well, too.'

Vieira asked her about Cosby after her fellow Celebrity Apprentice teammate, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on the Cosby Show, was quizzed about the scandal this week.

'I wasn't there,' Pulliam told the Today show on Monday. 'No one was there expect for the two people to know exactly what happened. All I can speak to is the man that I know and I love.'

Also in recent days, Phylicia Rashad, who played his on-screen wife, Clair Huxtable, came to his defense.

She was initially reported to have said to 'forget these women', but later explained that she does not think the discussion should be about the women, it should be about Cosby's damaged legacy.

Back to work: On Wednesday night, Cosby was met with empty seats and hecklers as he returned to the stage for the first time in 2015 (pictured). He performed a stand up show in Kitchener, Ontario, Canada

'It's difficult for me to watch this legacy be erased, as if [it] never happened,' she told ABC. 

She said she never saw anything inappropriate while they worked together and that Cosby's wife, Camille, would often visit the set, so when she heard the first allegations against him, she was suspicious.

'My initial reaction to the allegations was, "Hmm someone has a vested interest in preventing Cosby's return to network television",' she said.

Although she has not spoken to him recently, she said that no doubt the accusations have 'not been easy' for Cosby.

'I did talk to him towards the beginning of all of this and his comment was the internet has given some anonymous people a very loud voice,' she said. 

On-screen family: Earlier this week, Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy on the Cosby Show, defended Cosby, saying she was unable to pass judgment on the accusations because she was not there

Suspicious: His on-screen wife Phylicia Rashad, pictured on Nightline, also spoke out in his defense and said she believes the accusations are an orchestrated plan to keep him off network television

Cosby's career unraveled after his accusers came forward, with a TV project halted and at least 10 stand-up comedy tour performances canceled or indefinitely postponed.

The 77-year-old, who has been accused of drugging or sexual abuse by more than 20 women, including models Janice Dickinson and Beverly Johnson, has denied the allegations.  

On Wednesday, he returned to the stage in Ontario for his first show since November - and was met with empty seats and a sea of protesters brandishing signs reading: 'Rape is no joke.'   

The three performances in Canada come after Cosby saw at least 10 performances get canceled on his North American tour.

He next appears at the Budweiser Gardens in London, Ontario, on Thursday and at the Hamilton Place Theatre in Hamilton, Ontario, on Friday.
