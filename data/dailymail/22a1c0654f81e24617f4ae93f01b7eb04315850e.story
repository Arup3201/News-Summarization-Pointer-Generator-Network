Kenyan Dennis Kimetto has set a new world record by completing the Berlin Marathon in 2 hours, 2 minutes and 57 seconds on Sunday.

The 30-year-old knocked 26 seconds off the previous record of 2:03:23 set by his compatriot Wilson Kipsang in the same race last year.

Another Kenyan, Emmanuel Mutai, finished second and was also quicker than the previous best in 2:03:13.

Kimetto set a very quick pace from the start in perfect marathon-running conditions and shaved 26 seconds off the previous best time, also set in Berlin last year

2. Emmanuel Kipchirchir Mutai (Kenya) 2:03:13

3. Abera Kuma (Ethiopia) 2:05:56

4. Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor (Kenya) 2:06:39

5. Eliud Kiptanui (Kenya) 2:07:28

6. Franklin Chepkwony (Kenya) 2:07:35

7. Levy Matebo (Kenya) 2:08:33

Ethiopia's Abera Kuma finished third in 2:05:56. All the times are as yet unofficial.

The race in German capital saw some 40,0004 runners from 130 nations compete in perfect clear conditions.

Kimetto, the pre-race favourite, set a scintillating pace from the starting gun and broke away with a group of six others after about 20km.

With four kilometres remaining, he pulled clear from Mutai after the Kenyan pair had earlier shaken off another compatriot, Geoffrey Kamworor.

'I feel good because I won a very tough race,' the soft-spoken Kimetto told reporters. 'I felt good from the start and in the last five kilometres I felt I could do it (break the record).'

The Berlin marathon drew just over 40,000 runners to the streets of the German capital 

1. Tirfi Tsegaye Beyene (Ethiopia) 2:20:18

2. Feyse Tadese (Ethiopia) 2:20:27

3. Shalane Flanagan (U.S.) 2:21:14

4. Tadelech Bekele (Ethiopia) 2:23:02

5. Abebech Afework (Ethiopia) 2:25:02

The tall Kimetto was by no means unknown and had provided evidence of his class at the distance with wins in Tokyo and Boston last year.

He had promised to attack the record in Berlin if conditions allowed and on Sunday he could not have hoped for better weather.

With temperatures hovering around eight degrees Celsius at the start and gradually inching warmer as the race progressed, the Kenyan stayed in the lead group from the beginning and was always positioned near the front.

The last pacemakers stepped aside at around 30 kilometres as the Kenyan trio gradually broke clear.

Mutai twice attempted to attack but Kimetto stayed strong and made his own move at the 38km mark, with his compatriot soon dropping some 20 metres behind.

With the iconic Brandenburg Gate in full view, Kimetto powered through the final stretch to clock a world best, with Mutai second 16 seconds behind, and Ethiopian Abera Kuma overtaking a fading Kamworor late on to claim third.

Ethiopia were successful in the women's race, however, as Tirfi Tsegaye Beyene edged out her compatriot Feyse Tadese in a time of 2 hours, 20 minutes and 18 seconds.
