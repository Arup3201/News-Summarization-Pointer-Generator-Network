Not allowed: This photo of Jessica Urbina will not be used in her yearbook because she wore a tux

A high school student has been left out of her yearbook because she wore a tuxedo in her senior portrait, her family have said - as anger amounts against the school for its decision.

Officials at Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory School argued that Jessica Urbina's tuxedo went against an 
Archdiocese of San Francisco policy, which forces female students to wear 
dresses in yearbook photos, SFGate reported.

The 
18-year-old's brother, Michael, is leading the voices of anger against the 
school, with many other students turning up to classes on Friday wearing
 bow ties and ties in support.

'SHC, please explain to me why MY SISTER 
cannot receive the same treatment as every other student? Why Sacred 
Heart Cathedral?' he wrote on Twitter.

Jessica's girlfriend, Katie 
Emanuel, said outside the school: 'I support my girlfriend. I love my school, and
 I want to make it as good as it can be for people like us.'

As pressure
 grew against the school, it released a statement suggesting it would 
try to change the policy - without saying what would happen with 
Urbina's picture.

'As we prepare to pass out yearbooks, it 
is always regretful when a student portrait is omitted for any reason,' 
the statement said. 'We will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that 
all students are included in the future.'

Support: Jessica, 18, is pictured in the tux with her girlfriend, Katie Emanuel, at the school prom

But her brother said that the school just wanted to use a different picture of his sister, rather than the tux image.

In a statement, he said: 'I am 
embarrassed to call myself an alumni of a high school that does not 
equitably acknowledge, respect, value and empower all of its students.'

The principal, Gary Cannon, addressed reporters outside the school.

'Every student, every senior, is in the 
yearbook,' he said outside the school. ' It has to do with the ‘senior 
portrait issue’ and the regulations that we have. Those policies are 
clearly laid out.'

According to the school policy, girls must wear 'drapes' and boys must wear a shirt, tie and coat.

He said that he had previously spoken with Jessica about what was allowed in the photograph.

He added: 'Straight, gay, bi, transgender, all that. They’re all welcome at Sacred Heart Cathedral, and at the same time we’re going to be clear in terms of being a Catholic institution what the Catholic church teaches and how do we live out that faith in a meaningful way, and in a supportive way with all of our students,' he said.

Michael Urbina is meeting with school administrators about the issue on Friday or Monday. Neither he nor his sister have seen the final yearbook.
