The Chinese army is finding itself shopping for new tanks as their soldiers have grown - quite literally - in the 30 years since they were made.

The average Chinese soldier is three-quarters of an inch taller, and two inches bigger around the waist, than they were 20 years ago, the army's newspaper said.

The survey, which examined more than 20,000 troops over five years, found that the 'fatter' modern soldiers could no longer squeeze into tanks designed in the early 1980s.

Growing pains: The average Chinese soldier is three-quarters of an inch taller and two inches bigger around the waist than they were 20 years ago

As the soldiers have also become taller on average, rifle barrels are now too short, leading to accuracy problems, the official People's Liberation Army Daily newspaper reported Tuesday.

Adjustments would be made, with 28 body measurements taken into consideration when designing new firearms and other equipment, the report said.

According to the Overseas Development Institute overweight and obesity rates have almost doubled in China since 1980.

The rise in urban areas is significantly higher as fast food has been incorporated into the previously low-fat plant-based diet in China.

Bigger operation: As a result of the increase in size of recruits in China's People's Liberation Army, soldiers do no longer fit into the army's tanks

A 2009 study by the Chinese Health 
Ministry found that the average six-year-old boy living in an urban area
 was 2.5 inches taller and 6.6lbs heavier than 30 years before.

Big
 Baby Syndrome - also known as macrosomia - is also becoming increasingly 
common, with 6.9 per cent of babies in China born weighing more than 8lbs 13oz, according
 to the study, published in medical journal The Lancet last year.

China
 has the world's second-largest defense budget after the United States, 
spending heavily on new planes, ships, tanks and weapons of all sorts. 
Its 2.3 million-member standing army is the world's largest.
