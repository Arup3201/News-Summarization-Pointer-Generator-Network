'Since the incident, Ms. Martin consistently denied touching (the coach) and certainly never threatened his safety,' Rouse said in an email, the Atlanta station reported.

The confrontation happened inside a school office Jan. 9, after the South Cobb girls team lost to Campbell High School, authorities said.

Martin also is accused of throwing a chair and telling Harris she would stomp him and knock his teeth out, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.

Martin was charged with terroristic threats and acts, and simple battery. She intends to vigorously fight the charges, her attorney said.

'While she would like to respond in great detail revealing (the victim's) true motivation for making such a sensational claim, based upon the advice of counsel, she must respect legal process and will introduce facts at the appropriate time in court,' Rouse wrote.

School officials have not released information on her status as a coach, WSB reported.
