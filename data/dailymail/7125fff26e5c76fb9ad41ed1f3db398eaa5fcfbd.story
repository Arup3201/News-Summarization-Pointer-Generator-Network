A human rights watchdog has criticised a string of celebrities including Oscar-winning actress Hilary Swank for attending a concert celebrating the birthday of Chechnyan leader Ramzan Kadyrov.

New York-based Human Rights Watch hit out at Swank, Belgian actor Jean-Claude Van Damme and British violinist Vanessa Mae for attending the event in Grozny last week.

Kadyrov has been accused of rights abuses including orchestrated abductions, extra-judicial killings and the enforcement of Sharia law in the Russian republic of Chechnya.

Human Rights Watch allegedly contacted some artists urging them not to perform and to 'avoid legitimising people like' Kadyrov.

The lavish multi-million dollar birthday event was held last Wednesday at a police-cordoned concert hall on Kadyrov's 35th birthday.

During the event on October 5, Kadyrov took to the stage to address crowds who had gathered in the residential and commercial complex in the Chechen capital.

He thanked Russia's Prime Minister Vladimir Putin for helping rebuild the region that was devastated by two separatist wars.

Earlier in the day the controversial 
leader opened a riverside complex that includes three skyscrapers, a 
hotel and conference centre.

A hospital, bridge and an avenue named after Mr Kadyrov's late father, Akhmad, who was killed in a suicide bombing in 2004, was also unveiled.

Kadryov denied that the bash had been 
staged to celebrate his birthday and insisted instead that the gathering
was to mark the 193rd anniversary of the founding of Grozny.  The 
celebrations had been paid for by the Kremlin.

'There will be no ceremonies around my
birthday,' he said, according to the Telegraph. 'I categorically forbid
any events to be devoted to it wherever they are.'

However, critics pointed out that the host of celebrities in attendance signalled that the celebrations were for Kadyrov.

It is understood that violinist Vanessa Mae was charging a fee of half a million dollars (£320,000) to perform in a concert.

But Colombian singer Shakira is believed to have turned down an invitation to perform at the event.

'Rights activists wrote a letter to Shakira telling her not to come because the authorities here kill people and human rights are breached,' Kadyrov said in a TV interview.

'Only enemies of the people could write this.'

The artists' representatives were not immediately available for comment.

Kadyrov became president in 2007 three years after his father Akhmad Kadyrov, the former Chechen President, was assassinated.

Kadyrov had the support of Putin and he was awarded the Hero of Russia medal following violent clashes with Chechan government warlords for control of the country.

Despite stabilising the country and redeveloping large parts of the war-ravaged capital, he has come under fire for alleged corruption and human rights abuses.

Mr Kadyrov has insisted that he is innocent and dismissed the accusation as smears against him by his enemies.
