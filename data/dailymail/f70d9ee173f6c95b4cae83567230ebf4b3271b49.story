Glamorous in sequins and hats embellished with sprays of peacock feathers and lashings of lace, the stylish women of Doncaster were out in force as Ladies Day at the St Leger Festival got underway.

One of the oldest British race meetings, the St Leger festival started life in 1776 and has since become a Yorkshire institution - and a magnet for racing fans from all over the county.

But although the going was good and the bookies busy, all eyes were instead on the colourfully dressed ladies as they descended on the racecourse dressed to impress in bold brights and chic monochrome ensembles.

Elegant though the many ladies in black and white were, the big winners in the style stakes wore cheerful brights, with one lady opting for a pretty coral frock accessorised with nude peep toe heels and a demure neutral straw fascinator.

Another looked wonderful in an all-lemon ensemble, while bright shades of crimson, royal blue and emerald green also looked super and certainly stood out from the rest.

Unfortunately not everyone displayed the same good taste, with one or two opting for ensembles better suited to clubbing with the heels to match, while some also sported enormous tattoos.

Nevertheless, with fashion scouts scouring the racecourse for the best dressed lady, the vast majority had clearly made a real effort to wow the judges and win the top prize of a holiday to New York.

Pulling out all the stops: With a trip to New York the prize for the best-dressed racegoer, ladies arriving at the St. Leger Festival had pulled out all the stops

Aintree might have the world's biggest race in the shape of the Grand National but Doncaster is just as prestigious and like its Liverpudlian competitor, has plenty to offer in the style stakes.

Both Aintree, Doncaster and neighbouring York have relatively relaxed dress codes compared to Ascot, although all three insist on guests making do without jeans and sportswear.

As at Aintree, Doncaster is a hotbed of northern glamour with short skirts and sky high heels regularly spotted in and around the paddock. Colourful hats are a more recent innovation, although as today's event demonstrates, the ladies of Doncaster know a thing or two when it comes to buying hats.

Indeed, with the majority of ladies arriving dressed to kill, organisers have decided it is male racegoers who require a bigger nudge, with the more specific rules laid out for men.

For instance, while ladies must be 'smartly dressed', men are told to wear a jacket and tie in the Premier Enclosure and a collared shirt in the County Enclosure and in private boxes.

In the Grandstand, however, no real dress code applies with even fancy dress allowed, provided you call the racecourse first and let them know what to expect.

Peacock: As at York, Aintree and Ascot, peacock feather plumes proved popular among stylish racegoers, as did bold brights and even a dash or two of print

Lady in red: A glamorous racegoer shows off her classic red and black ensemble, complete with a crimson lace dress, an elegant pendant and a vast titfer

Going for bold: A lady opts for a large hat decorated with plumes of peacock feathers, while another chooses a revealing dress in a flattering shade of green

The winner's haul also includes a trip to London Fashion Week, while runners-up also get prizes and a place in Doncaster Racecourse's #bestdressedselfie social media campaign.

'DFS Ladies Day is the social highlight of the four day St Leger Festival with ladies from across South Yorkshire donning their most stylish outfits and hats and going all out to look their very best,' explains Doncaster Racecourse managing director, Mark Spincer.

'Weâ€™re delighted that sponsors DFS are providing us with another fantastic star prize of a trip to New York which is guaranteed to be an added incentive for ladies to pull out all stops, get dressed up, enjoy a great day out at the races and have the chance of securing the coveted Best Dressed Lady crown.'

The second day of the St Leger race meeting, Ladies Day brings more than 60,000 racing fans flocking to Doncaster as well as some of the world's biggest racehorse owners.

Among them is Sir Alex Ferguson, who was spotted enjoying the action on day one, Saudi Arabia's Prince Khalid Abdullah and Her Majesty the Queen, whose bay thoroughbred Sea Shanty will tackle the Crownhotel-bawtry.com Handicap at 3.45pm today.
