Brendan Rodgers has hailed the talents of Mario Balotelli ahead of Liverpool's clash with AC Milan in North Carolina.

The Anfield boss is in the market for a new striker after the proposed £8.5million deal to sign Queens Park Rangers' Loic Remy collapsed due to a failed medical.

And Rodgers says he's a fan of the controversial Italy international, who has been heavily linked with a return to the Premier League this summer.

Star striker: Brendan Rodgers admits he is a big fan of the talented AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli

Focused: Balotelli is reportedly keen on a Premier League switch this summer

'Balotelli is a big talent,' Rodgers said.

'I saw that in this time at Inter Milan as a young player and obviously going to Manchester City when we had a real close eye on him there.

'He's got all the qualities. He's 6ft 3ins, he's quick, his touch is terrific and he can score goals.

'He went back to Italy to play and he's still so young. If his focus is right, his concentration is right and he leads the lifestyle of a top player then he can play for any team in the world.'

Liverpool face Milan at Charlotte's Bank of America Stadium on Saturday night knowing victory will secure their place in Monday's final of the International Champions Cup in Miami.

Rodgers' side have already beaten Olympiacos and Manchester City in the tournament and one major plus has been the form of defender Sebastian Coates.

The Uruguayan centre-back missed most of last season with a serious knee injury but is now back to full fitness and has impressed in the States.

'Seb is a player who played in the team when I first came into the club and then was out of the team,' Rodgers said.

'He was very unfortunate to have had a bad injury which put him out for a while, but he went away on loan, got himself fit and he's come back and done really well in pre-season.

'He's a real good guy as well, a humble man, never cries about not playing and accepts as a professional he won't play in every game

Technique: The boss said Coates is excellent on the deck considering his height

'He's a big boy but he can play football. He has a lovely touch, lovely technique but he can pass the ball and he can be aggressive.

'The question is whether he gets enough games that will satisfy his own personal needs because he's a talent.

'He's done well in the games and we'll see what the rest of the summer holds for him.'

As well as searching for more firepower, Liverpool are working on deals to sign Sevilla left-back Alberto Moreno and Atletico Madrid right-back Javier Manquillo.

However, Rodgers wouldn't be drawn on the club's transfer activity.

'We won't have too much business to be done but we still have a few areas we want to strengthen,' he said.

'It's just purely on the back of us having a really thin squad last season, we were very short and it was incredible what we achieved last year.

'We need to make sure we have the freshness so there's still one or two areas to look at.

'There is no point mentioning numbers or positions, we want to strengthen a couple of positions and if we can do that I'll be really happy.

'This trip has been a great chance to come away, improve fitness levels and reintroduce some of the tactics into the team.

'The new players have settled in quickly. That's a great credit not just to just them but to the team. There's no egos here and the spirit in the team is very strong.
