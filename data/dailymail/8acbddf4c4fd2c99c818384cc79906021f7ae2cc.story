More than four decades after an explosion near Chi Chi in Vietnam left Patrick Olive with permanent nerve damage he has been told he is to receive a Purple Heart.

Olive, 66, was drafted into the army in 1968 and after basic training in South Carolina was sent to Vietnam as part of the 25th Infantry Division, which saw heavy fighting in Saigon.

At just 21, Olive suffered damage to his right leg in an explosion, an injury he is finally receiving recognition for.

More than four decades after an explosion near Chi Chi in Vietnam left Patrick Olive, pictured above with his wife Evelyn, with permanent nerve damage he has been told he is to receive a Purple Heart

The Florida resident was notified of his award in a letter from the Department of Army last month, which noted that its records 'have now been corrected'. 

According to Olive's citation for valor, in November 1968, with complete disregard for his own safety' the solider exposed himself to heavy fire to retrieve 'desperately needed' ammunition which he then supplied to his comrades.

Then, according to a report in the Sun-Sentinel, in April 1969, while in a difficult defensive position, Olive again 'distinguished himself by heroic actions'. Olive volunteered to brave heavy fire to resupply his section on the perimeter.

After being wounded, Olive spent months in hospitals in Vietnam, Japan, Washington and then finally in San Juan, Puerton Rico, at the Veterans Affairs Facility closet to his home in St Thomas. 

Olive will receive a Purple Heart along with the Army Commendation Medal with a V for valor, a Good Conduct medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, with four bronze service stars, and his expert badge as a rifleman

Olive's met his wife Evelyn, a hospital dietitian, when he was being treated for his injuries. The pair kept in touch after his release and connected a year later. They have now been married for 43 years. 

She said: 'When he gets that medal it will be mission accomplished.

'We will all be proud. I will be proud of my hero.' 

Vietnam was not a popular war and as a result when Olive returned home, he didn't speak about the atrocities he saw and endured there. Neither did he pursue the Purple Heart or other service medals he was entitled to.

Olive, who spent 30-years chasing drug smugglers in the Caribbean as a U.S. Customs Service agent after the war, said: 'War was a nightmare. 

Olive suffered nerve damage to his leg age 21, during an explosion while bravely retrieving ammunition for his comrades while under heavy fire; he 'distinguished himself by heroic actions' again a year later

'It was hell. It's nothing you like to talk about.'

After years in St. Thomas Olive moved to Miami in the early 1980s, where he and Evelyn had a son, Francisco. He now works for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. 

The couple then moved to Plantation and Olive retired in 2002.

He wrote to the army about his award last summer, at his wife's urging.

He told the newspaper: 'All veterans deserve to be honored for the sacrifices they and their families gave for this country,' Evelyn Olive said. 'The medal would be an acknowledgment of what he went through. So I said let's go for it.'

In addition to the Purple Heart, Olive will also receive the Army Commendation Medal with a V for valor, a Good Conduct medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, with four bronze service stars, and his expert badge as a rifleman.
