It is the biggest and most chaotic month for Britain's retailers.

But it appears shoppers looking for the best bargains would fare better heading to New York.

The pound has hit its highest level against the US dollar for nearly two and a half years - 1.65 dollars.

This means UK holidaymakers now have up to 28 per cent more spending money for trips to America's biggest shopping hotspots, such as Bloomingdale's, Macy's and Barneys New York, according to a Post Office Travel Money survey.

It comes amid rising hopes for Britain's economic recovery.

The nation's economy has been picking up pace in recent months - with figures continuing to suggest that the Bank of England will raise interest rates earlier than expected.

Astonishingly, the UK is predicted to
 become Europe's largest economy in just two decades, overtaking France 
and Germany, according to a report from the Centre for Economics 
and Business Research (CEBR).

Last year, Britain's growth was 0.3 per cent higher than a previous estimate of 0.1 per cent, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Meanwhile, the figure for the first quarter of this year was revised up from 0.4 per cent to 0.5 per cent and for the second quarter, from 0.7 per cent to 0.8 per cent.

The stronger pound is good news for holidaymakers - with cheap trips now available in a range of countries as the sterling strengthens against the local currency.

The best-value destination for a seven-day New Year break is Sharm 
el-Sheikh in Egypt (£399), with Orlando in Florida (£719) and Dubai (£983) also offering good deals.

Meanwhile, sun-seekers can travel to Playa del Carmen in Mexico for one week for just £899, according to a Post Office Travel Money and Travelbag survey.

Paul
 Havenhand, Post Office head of travel, said: 'Egypt's Red Sea resorts 
have always been a good value option, but it's not just Sharm el-Sheikh 
where sun-seekers will find their pounds stretch further.

'Sterling 
currently buys more holiday cash in all 10 of our January hotspots, with
 the biggest benefits to be found in Cape Town and Bali.

'Holidaymakers
 can make sure they get the best value by doing their holiday homework 
before booking to see how the overall costs stack up.'

As well as boosting tourists' spending power, a stronger pound has also helped bring down UK inflation by making it cheaper for Britain to import goods and services.

However, sterling's rise to 1.65 dollars - a level not seen since August 2011 - could prove difficult for manufacturers and exporters.

This is because a stronger pound makes products more expensive for overseas buyers; therefore, potentially dampening demand.

The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee recently warned that a significant increase in the pound's strength could pose risks to the recovery, while also hampering the Government's aims to rebalance the economy towards manufacturing and exports.
