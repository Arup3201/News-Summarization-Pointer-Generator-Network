Imagine waking up to a whale outside your window, or snoozing in mid-air.

Well, in 10 years' time this could be a reality for holidaymakers with technological advances continuing to gather pace.

Journeys to the bottom of the sea will be a much more mainstream, fashionable option, with a few already in existence such as The Neptune and Poseidon suite at the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai.

The race for space will initially take travellers to Earth's low orbit allowing them to experience the stunning curvature of the globe from ultra-high altitude.

The report's findings highlight the current Foster + Partners and ESA work exploring the possibilities of 3D printing to construct lunar habitations. 

Space lovers will also be able to visit sky resorts currently being developed that are set to contain zero-gravity spas, space gliders and space observatories where guests can experience weightlessness.

Advances in technology mean that hotels will be able to provide incredible levels of hyper-personalisation for their guests, providing a tailored overnight experience. 

The report predicts that pillows with embedded electronics will provide sleep-aiding massages, rooms will be designed to reset the internal clocks of jet-lagged guests, and advances in technology will mean that guests can have unique experiences like jet-lag solutions such as shower water infused with Vitamin D.

And forget any trips to the gym while you're on holiday - guests will be able to work out alongside a digital personal trainer in the comfort of their own room.

The Skyscanner Future of Travel report has been produced in association with The Future Laboratory and fifty-six trend experts and futurologists in the travel and tech industries. 

It paints a detailed picture of how breakthrough technologies will shape the global travel industry from planning and booking a holiday, right through to exciting new destinations.

Filip Filipov, Skyscanner spokesman, said: 'Taking travel to space will be a ground-breaking milestone for mankind in general.

'But what is even more exciting is the transfer of technologies that space exploration can bring to commercial aviation.

'A regular traveller might see a London to Sydney flight in two-and-a-half hours, which will make travel even easier and faster than ever before, breaking time boundaries.'

The firm conducted the research ahead of World Space Week, which runs from October 4-10.
