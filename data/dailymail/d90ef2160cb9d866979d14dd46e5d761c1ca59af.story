A devastated former Miss Delaware sobbed during an interview today after being stripped of her coveted crown on Thursday because she is too old.

Amanda Longacre, 24, was forced to give up the title and her chance at being Miss America to runner-up Brittany Lewis after it was discovered she had broken the rules.

Miss Longacre turns 25 in October and the rules state that beauty queens must be between 17 and 24 throughout 2014 to compete in the September Miss America pageant.

After less than two weeks as Miss Delaware, the beauty queen was forced to hand back her crown when the age discrepancy was discovered by the national competition.

The beauty pageant winner broke down while speaking to the Today show on Friday over the heartache of losing her crown and the chance to compete to become Miss America

The 24-year-old Penn State graduate wept when she was crowned Miss Delaware earlier this month. The title has now been handed to someone else

Miss Longacre, from Bear, Delaware, told Today: 'I lost everything and they want to erase me forever.'

She added: 'It really hurts because when your peers vote you for Miss Congeniality, you work so hard to get to this position. I haven't been doing pageants for very long, this is all brand new to me.'

The Penn State graduate said that giving up her crown also meant she would lose $11,000 in scholarship money and the chance to represent the people of Delaware.

The 24-year-old, who wants to be a social worker, said that the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization signed a contract saying that she could compete after she provided her birth certificate and driving license.

She said that although the age rule is in her contract, she assumed she was eligibleÂ because the organization signed off. She believes she is being punished for a mistake made by pageant authorities and is consulting an attorney.

Miss Longacre said that the Miss American pageant has ignored her attempts to contact them.
