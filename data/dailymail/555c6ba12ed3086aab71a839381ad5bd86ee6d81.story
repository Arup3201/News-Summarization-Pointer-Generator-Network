Patients are facing a bleak end to the year as A&E units, GP surgeries and the ambulance service struggle to cope with unprecedented demand.

A string of reports yesterday painted a picture of a system creaking at the seams due to the rising population.

At one overcrowded inner city surgery, GPs are being forced to offer patients quickfire two-minute consultations just to ensure that they can be seen before Christmas.

A leaked letter from NHS medical director Sir Bruce Keogh has revealed people are now routinely waiting more than 12 hours on trolleys even after doctors have decided they need a hospital bed.

And only yesterday the Daily Mail revealed patients were resorting to queuing up outside another GP practice in Surrey at dawn just to get an appointment.

Last night, as Labour said the NHS was in danger of being ‘overwhelmed’, it also emerged that:

■ Elderly patients – so-called bed blockers – are being kept in hospital for up to a year after being declared fit for discharge;

■ Sir Bruce has written to hospital managers demanding a ‘zero tolerance’ of long trolley waits;

■ London Mayor Boris Johnson has urged the public to take a taxi to A&E rather than dialling 999 to help ease the pressure on the ambulance service.

A&E units are facing unprecedented strain and last week recorded their worst waiting times on record. On Monday, Sir Bruce wrote to hospital managers warning of a ‘worrying increase’ in patients spending more than four hours on trolleys in casualty.

Ambulance bosses have been forced to recruit paramedics from Poland amid an estimated nationwide shortage of 3,000.

South Central Ambulance Service, which covers Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, said it was advertising abroad to hire 220 paramedics and technicians and 70 emergency care assistants.

Details of the desperate shortage of 999 workers emerged as a leaked memo this week revealed plans to allow ambulance response times for some serious calls to double from eight to 19 minutes amid a severe strain on the nationwide service.

South Central Ambulance confirmed it had been hiring overseas because its recruitment plans had been ‘challenged’ by the nationwide shortage of paramedics.

A spokesman said: ‘We have been carrying out some international recruitment in Poland for paramedics where their qualifications, skills and experience are very similar to our own and meet our own high standards for staff.’

The Trust said it was also looking at other countries.

The news came after the London Ambulance Service announced it had flown to the other side of the world to hire 175 Australian paramedics to start in January because of the small number of local applicants.

The letter, passed to the Daily Mail, told them to carry out a full investigation every time a patient ended up for waiting more than 12 hours.

Dated 22 December and sent to medical directors at hospital trusts, it reads: ‘There should be a zero tolerance of over 12-hour waits for admission and such a wait should be classified as a serious incidence, and we would expect a root-cause analysis.’

The pressures are partly due to an ongoing crisis caused by bed-blocking, in which hospitals have to look after elderly patients even when they are well enough to be discharged due to a lack of care at home.

The shortage of beds on wards prevents sick patients being moved out of A&E so they remain languishing on trolleys.

Figures uncovered by Labour from Freedom of Information requests show that in 2013/14, a total of 26 bed-blocking patients were kept in hospital for least three months.

This included one at United Lincolnshire Hospitals who was there for 365 days because of ‘patient or family choice’.

The trust would not provide further details. But in some cases, relatives have demanded hospitals look after elderly patients while they go on holiday or simply because they don’t like a care home’s curtains.

At York Teaching Hospital a patient was kept in for 329 days, also due to their own choice or that of their family, while at West Middlesex someone waited eight months because there was no space in a care home.

Bed blockers cost the NHS an average of £264 for each day they are kept in hospital.

Last month, more than 29,000 patients languished on trolleys for at least four hours – including 26 for more than 12 hours.

Gordon Miles, chief executive of the College of Emergency Medicine, which represents A&E doctors, said: ‘It’s very challenging at the moment. Last week was one of the worst weeks for a long, long time.

‘We’re expecting it to be very busy over Christmas. It doesn’t show any sign of a let-up. If a hospital is bunged up with people who can’t be discharged, patients will have to wait on trolleys or in ambulances outside.’

Dr Mark Porter, chair of the British Medical Association’s council, said: ‘GP services are under unsustainable pressure, hospitals are full and investment in adult social care has been slashed.’ Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘This Christmas there are record numbers of elderly people trapped in hospital who would rather be at home with their families.

‘It is a sad reflection on a system that is creaking at the seams and in danger of being overwhelmed.’

Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said: ‘These figures are yet another serious warning sign of growing pressure on GP practices and district nurses and a social care system on the verge of collapse because funding has utterly failed to keep pace with demand.’

Yesterday Mr Johnson issued an urgent appeal to the public not to dial 999 over the festive period unless it was a genuine emergency.

He urged patients to take a taxi to A&E if they suffer minor fractures after slipping on ice or when partying. The ambulance service is under considerable pressure. Earlier this week it emerged that the Government was considering relaxing waiting time targets for serious incidents.

Last night it also emerged that ambulance and NHS staff are planning a two-day strike over New Year.

The GMB union said paramedics would still respond to 999 calls. Similar protests were held over the Autumn.

Meanwhile one unnamed GP surgery was yesterday offering patients two-minute appointments to ensure they were seen before Christmas. A photo was taken of the appointments chart by a whistleblowing doctor and circulated on Twitter.

A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘These figures give a misleading impression - while long waits to be discharged are unacceptable, there are actually fewer as a proportion of hospital admissions over the last few years. We know the NHS is busier than ever which is why we’ve given it an extra £700million for thousands more doctors, nurses and beds this winter.

‘The NHS has ensured there are plans in every area to manage extra demand.’
