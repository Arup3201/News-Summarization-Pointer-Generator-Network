A gay couple were forced off a bus after the driver branded them 'not real men' as he delivered a tirade of homophobic abuse after he spotted them kissing.

Jack James, 23, had been travelling through London on his way home from work when he was ordered off the bus after his partner gave him a light kiss. 

He said the driver of the London bus told the couple it was disgusting and kicked them off, saying 'my bus, my rules.'

The abuse is the latest in a series of homophobic incidents, and follows a mass kiss-in staged in Sainsbury's in Brighton last month, after a lesbian couple claim they were asked to leave because they were spotted kissing.

The gay couple were asked to leave the number 89 bus as they travelled through Blackheath, south London

The abuse is the latest in a series of homophobic incidents as protesters staged a kiss-in in earlier this month (above) after a lesbian couple were asked to leave a Sainsbury's store in Brighton allegedly for kissing

Transport for London said it was investigating the incident on the bus and studying CCTV footage. 

Mr James, an events coordinator from Greenwich, told the Evening Standard: 'This type of homophobic bullying cannot be tolerated. 

'I am considering making a complaint to the police about this.' 

He said the abuse started when the couple were travelling on the number 89 bus near Blackheath, at about 10.30pm on October 8.

Mr James said they were ordered off the bus after his partner gave him a peck on the lips and the driver started shouting and swearing, saying 'I don't want to watch that.' 

Confused, the couple confronted the driver to ask if he was talking to them when it stopped at the next stop. He replied that he was, and told them they were disgusting. 

'Once we got off the bus we were fuming and I was shaking,' said Mr James. 'The bus stopped again and he shouted and told us we were not real men and we should f*** off.” 

Shoppers watched as a couple kissed in store as part of the kiss-in protest at the supermarket in Brighton

The kiss-in was held after Annabelle Sacher and her partner were asked to leave the Sainsbury's supermarket

Ken Davidson, TfL’s Head of Bus Operations, said: 'All customers have the right to use our services without fear of being abused and offensive behaviour is completely unacceptable.' 

He said the matter was being thoroughly investigated. 

The incident comes after protesters staged a mass kiss-in in a Sainsbury's store in Brighton earlier this month after a lesbian couple were asked to leave the store. 

Annabelle Sacher and her girlfriend were asked to leave the shop after a customer complained when she saw the student give her girlfriend a spontaneous peck on the cheek. 

 The customer had complained she found the lesbian kiss 'disgusting' and was concerned for her child, and Miss Sacher and her partner were asked to leave. 

The row began on National Coming Out Day and led to criticism from gay rights campaigners. 

Sainsbury's apologised after the incident and promised it would not happen again. A spokesman said that the security guard had not told Miss Sacher to leave, but had asked her to stop kissing. The supermarket has made a donation to a charity of Miss Sacher’s choice.

Couple Michael Black, 62, and John Morgan, 59, were refused a room together at a B&B in 2010 for being gay

In 2010 Christian bed and breakfast owners Susanne and Mike Wilkinson were forced to pay £3,600 compensation to Michael Black, 64, and his partner John Morgan, 59, after they refused to let them share a room at their B&B in Berkshire.

Mrs Wilkinson was ordered to pay £3,600 in damages for discriminating directly against the couple, who have been together for eight years.

She claimed as a devout Christian she had refused to let non-married heterosexual couples share a double bed.
