John Prescott wrote in a Sunday newspaper that he wanted to pass on concerns that the Queen was 'overburdening' herself

John Prescott has come under fire for suggesting the Queen should abdicate because of her recent bout of ill-health.

The former deputy prime minister said he wanted to pass on concerns that the 86-year-old monarch was 'overburdening' herself.

As a former Cabinet minister, Mr Prescott sits on the Privy Council.

In his column for a Sunday newspaper, he wrote: ‘Last week a straight-talking Yorkie friend asked me what Privy Councillors do. I said we formally advise the Queen.

‘Now, my friend is a staunch royalist but he said something which got me thinking.

‘His concern was that the Queen, who is 87 next month, is overburdening herself. He said she had done a remarkable job over her 60 years on the throne but was increasingly concerned at recent cancellations of public duties because of her ongoing ill-health.

‘My friend noted the monarch would be delivering her 61st Queen’s Speech in May, where she’ll announce her future trips abroad, on top of her many other public duties.

‘So he asked me, as a Privy Councillor, to tell her that he didn’t expect her to see out her royal duties as the Queen. She deserves a break and he wouldn’t think less of her if she stepped down.’

Mr Prescott added: ‘The point is important as we’ll all become more concerned for the heavy load she continues to carry as Head of State. She has given wise counsel to 12 prime ministers, from Churchill to Cameron, and has made her mark on the country she loves.’

He wrote: ‘I’m not sure whether the 
Queen reads the Sunday Mirror, or indeed my column. But if you do, 
Ma’am, I thought I’d pass on my friend’s concern.

‘He feels you have done so much for 
the UK and the Commonwealth that you deserve to break convention and 
consider enjoying a long and fulfilling retirement.

‘I’d
be interested to hear readers’ thoughts. Why not email me? Hopefully 
I’ll be able to read them on my phone if I end up in the Tower!’

Last night Tory MPs lined up to lambast Lord Prescott over his comments.

Conor Burns said: ‘John Prescott is the antithesis of the Queen. She is a model of selfless public service and duty. He is frittering away any last vestiges of dignity his career had with these sort of pig-ignorant comments.

‘Luckily for Her subjects I’m sure the Queen will ignore his silly advice.’

George Freeman said: ‘God save us. Never has this poor nation been more in need of the Queen’s quiet and understated wisdom, leadership and tireless public duty.

‘After a decade of Blair and Prescott’s 
“get rich quick” cronyism, Her Majesty The Queen’s reign is one of the 
few things in Britain the public still trust and have confidence in. May
she long reign over us.’

Mark Field added: ‘I think it is inappropriate for anyone in politics to speculate on the Monarch’s health.

‘What is clear is that she is very capable of handling a very big schedule. Under no circumstances will we see the Queen abdicate. It would undermine the very principle of monarchy. She continues to do a fantastic job.’

Robert Buckland said: ‘Lord Prescott fails to remember that the Queen took an oath to serve for the rest of her life.

‘It was an abdication that put her in direct line to the Throne, so I do not think that this is viewed by her as an option. Stop speculating and let her get on with the job.’

And Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘The Queen is anointed our Sovereign for life. It is a vocation not a job. Lord Prescott should remember his oath as a Privy Counsellor and as a peer.’ The Queen has repeatedly said that she does not plan to abdicate. Buckingham Palace declined to comment yesterday.
