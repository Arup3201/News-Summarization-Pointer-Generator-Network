BBC Radio 2 presenter Sara Cox helped put two burglars in prison after she tweeted CCTV images showing them raiding her brother's luxury home.

The DJ, 40, posted pictures of unemployed brothers Gary and Barry Foulkes breaking into artist Robert Cox's garage before making off with tools worth £720.

The brothers, who are both drug addicts, were arrested less than 24 hours after Ms Cox asked her 750,000 Twitter followers for help tracking the men down.

Her tweet said: 'These lads are robbing my brothers @rcoxART house thurs night, Bolton/Ainsworth area. DO YOU RECOGNISE THEM?'.

She later added: 'Look, more pics of the lads stealing from my big bro's house the gits. Who are they?'

Gary Foulkes, 33, who has clocked up 111 earlier offences including several burglaries, was jailed for 16 weeks.

His brother Barry, 28, was jailed for 12 weeks after both admitted burglary. They were each ordered to pay £360 compensation as none of the stolen gardening equipment has been recovered. 

The pair raided Mr Cox's garage at his gated home near Bolton on January 8 after the artist, who also runs a travel company, stopped painting work for the night, Bury Magistrates' Court heard.

Martin Brogan, prosecuting, said: 'He returned at 9am and noticed a number of items missing - two hedge trimmers, chain saw and leaf sucker to the value of £720.

'His property is covered by CCTV and he reviewed the CCTV and saw two people climbing over the wall from the public footpath. After reviewing the CCTV footage he called the police. The items stolen have not been recovered.'

Ms Cox, who presents Sound of the 80s on BBC Radio 2 on Saturday evenings, posted images of the burglary on Twitter and the culprits were caught within 24 hours

The Foulkes brothers were identified as the culprits shortly after Ms Cox's tweets were posted and re-tweeted more than 4,000 times.

During police interviews shown to the court, both burglars admitted having drug problems. 

Defence lawyer Leanne Hurst said Barry Foulkes, who lives alone on benefits in rented accommodation, suffered from depression and had been a drug addict since the age of 24.

She said: 'He tells me he is sorry for his actions and understands his behaviour is unacceptable. By its very nature this is a serious allegation - but it is not the most serious of its kind. There was no significant damage caused or any ransacking. I would argue that it may not be a significant loss to the victim. There is certainly no damage caused in terms of monetary value.

'He tells me he does have issues in relation to drugs, in particular heroin. He tells me at the time of this certain offence he was using heroin and gave this as the reason for the offence. He tells me he is able to be drug-free and tells me this is what he wants.'

Caught: The CCTV images were seen by thousands of people on Twitter, with the men quickly arrested

Miss Hurst said Gary Foulkes, who lives with his pregnant partner, had been 'self medicating' with heroin after injuring his hand. 

She added: 'He again understands there is no excuse for his behaviour and he is remorseful for his actions. 

'There is the option for employment as a labourer but this is dependent on the outcome of this court case.'

Passing sentence, Dennis Hilton chairman of the bench said: 'We consider that this has crossed the custodial threshold and we have taken an account of the significant loss to the victim and prior convictions.'

At the time the brothers' arrest Ms Cox, who presents Sound of the 80s on BBC Radio 2 on Saturday evenings, thanked her followers and said: 'You're all brilliant. Thanks to all the retweets - 2 suspects now in custody. My bro @rcoxART & I super grateful. Thanks @gmpolice too.'
