The wasteful’ NHS should not be exempt from spending cuts, a senior Tory said yesterday.

Former Cabinet minister Liam Fox urged David Cameron to scrap the so-called ring-fence that has protected health spending since the election despite austerity cuts at other departments.

Dr Fox, a former GP who was Tory health spokesman in opposition, said the policy of pouring ever more money into the NHS to improve standards had been ‘tested to destruction’.

He warned that Britain’s ability to successfully treat certain  conditions was exceeded by other nations despite massive investment during the last 15 years.

His intervention will fuel the internal Tory debate about whether the pledge should be repeated at the next election.

Dr Fox, who is seen as a standard-bearer for the Tory Right, said: ‘A lot of our health indicators lag behind other countries, particular things like stroke outcome or a lot of cancer outcomes.

‘We’ve become obsessed with throughput and not outcomes and that has been hugely to the detriment of patients. If you treat the NHS itself as the important entity and not the patients, then you’re on a hiding to nothing.’

He also said the decision to protect NHS budgets reduced the incentive to tackle inefficiency, adding: ‘Anybody who has worked with the NHS knows there is still a huge amount of waste.’

But a senior Tory source said: ‘The Prime Minister has been very clear – the ring-fencing of health spending was a manifesto commitment and it will remain.’
