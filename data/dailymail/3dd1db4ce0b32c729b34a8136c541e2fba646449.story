The International Space Station (ISS), the second brightest object in our night sky, celebrates its 15th birthday today.

Its journey began back in November 20th 1998, when the Russian Space Agency launched a spacecraft called Zarya into orbit.

The launch was the dawn of the largest international cooperation effort in space to ever come to fruition.

Zarya became the first piece of the International Space Station, which is currently in orbit 220 miles above Earth.

Two weeks later, on December 4 1998, the space shuttle Endeavour launched Unity, the first U.S. piece of the complex.

The two space modules built on opposite sides of the planet were about to be joined together in space, making the space station an international collaboration.

‘We definitely knew there was no margin for error on that first mission—we had to be successful,’ said Bob Cabana, the Kennedy Space Center director.

‘We also knew that it wasn’t all on the crew. This was a team effort, and everyone was giving it all they had to ensure success.’

Since that first momentous meeting of Zarya and Unity, the space station has grown piece by piece.

Today the ISS has a mass of almost a million pounds and is the size of a football field.

To date, station and shuttle crews have conducted 174 spacewalks totalling almost 1,100 hours

It represents a collaboration between Nasa, Roscosmos, the European Space Agency, the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.

The ISS is the only lab that can be used to carry out sustained scientific research in microgravity conditions.

So far at least 1,500 scientific studies have been carried out in space, and the results are being used back here on Earth by the 69 countries that have taken part.

Their arrival on board the station marked the start of a permanent human presence in space.

To date, station and shuttle crews have conducted 174 spacewalks totalling almost 1,100 hours – the equivalent to nearly 46 days of spacewalks to build and maintain the complex.

 ‘It’s hard to believe it’s been 15 years since we joined Unity and Zarya in orbit and laid the cornerstone for the International Space Station,’ Mr Cabana said.

‘It is truly an engineering marvel and a testament to what we can accomplish when we all work together.

‘It has provided us the framework for how we will move forward as we explore beyond our home planet, not as explorers from any one country, but as explorers from planet Earth.’

Nasa says it is confident the habitat is safe to stay in orbit until 2028, and possibly much longer.
