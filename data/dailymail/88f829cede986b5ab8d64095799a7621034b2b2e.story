Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert has confirmed there is no clause making him play Tom Cleverley after the on-loan midfielder's substitution against Chelsea was greeted with ironic cheers by sections of supporters.

Lambert believes Cleverley, on a season-long loan from Manchester United, is 'trying too hard' but has backed the player to win frustrated fans over.

Cleverley, whose second-half substitution in the 2-1 loss to Chelsea was once again cheered, is no stranger to incurring the wrath of supporters.

After another disappointing performance, sections of the home crowd cheered when Cleverley was taken off

He closed his Twitter account after suffering abuse from United fans, while an online petition was set up last year calling for him to be banned from England's World Cup squad.

Cleveley subsequently missed out on a place - yet the petition came in for criticism from Three Lions manager Roy Hodgson.

Lambert said: 'Tom is one of these guys who never hides from the ball. I never criticise anybody for looking for the ball if they make a mistake.

'As long as you don’t hide - and Tom never hides.

'He gives it everything he has got, everything to try and do well. He wants to do well here and sometimes that is part and parcel of football. It is not nice to hear.

'There was a wee spell where he had one or two he gave way in quick succession; other than that he had a decent game especially in the second half.

'Tom has played in massive games, he is no novice. Confidence goes when you don’ t want to take the ball.

'He has got confidence, it is nothing to do with hiding from the ball, the boy takes the ball and gives everything he has got.

'I don’t think it is that. he may be trying too hard which can go against you. He keeps on going with the ball and that is a big testament for him that he keeps doing it.

'He did ok on Saturday.'

Two of Villa's other central midfielders, Ashley Westwood and Carlos Sanchez, have both found themselves out of Lambert's team in recent weeks.

It has raised questions over whether the player may have had to be played every week as part of his loan terms.

But Lambert insisted he was under no pressure to play the England international as part of the deal which brought him from Old Trafford to Villa Park for the campaign.

'No, I don’t judge whether somebody is on loan,' he said. 'You try and pick a team you think will win a game.

'I don’t pick it through [anything else]. That is nowhere near [the mark].'
