They died together in the French Alps, trapped in their car by a mystery gunman as they took a scenic drive.

Yesterday, seven weeks after the murders, they finally came home to be buried side by side.

In a simple but emotionally-charged Muslim ceremony, design engineer Saad Al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her 74-year-old mother Suhaila Al-Allaf, were laid to rest in the same grave, in a private cemetery secluded by pine trees, in the rain-sodden Surrey countryside.

Female relatives wailed loudly and some of the menfolk sobbed as the coffins were opened, one by one, so that the victims’ bodies could be laid to face Mecca before being lowered.

Iraqi-born Mr Al-Hilli’s brother Zaid, 53, took up a shovel to help cover their remains.

Surrey detectives, who are working with French police, watched the proceedings from a discreet distance.

Investigators are following up a number of leads as they try to unravel the complex case, including business deals in Iraq which Mr Al-Hilli, from Claygate, Surrey, was involved in, and his work on sensitive satellite projects.

Yesterday’s traditional ceremony, 
arranged by the Iraqi embassy in London, began with a special prayer 
service attended by dozens of mourners at the Imam Khoei Mosque in 
Queen’s Park, north-west London.

Crime scene: The three family-members were found dead in this car in the Alps but a close relative today dismissed any idea of a feud leading to their deaths

Critical: French police inspect a drain under the road to the murder scene at Cheverlaine during their investigations -  Professor al-Saffar says they are ignoring key evidence

Then, followed by some 30 close relatives, friends and officials, the three plain wooden caskets were driven 40 miles to the Shia Muslim section of Brookwood Cemetery near Woking.

They were buried in a quiet corner next to Mr Al-Hilli’s father Kadhim, who died last year.

Mr Al-Hilli’s mother, Fahisa, lies nearby.

Incense sticks fizzled and a fine 
drizzle soaked the huddle of mourners – mainly Iraqis, but including one
 or two English friends – as the Imam, Ayatollah Dr Sayyid Al-Milani, 
led the graveside prayers.

The family left their Europa campsite after two nights and moved to the La Solitude du Lac campsite, which overlooks Lake Annecy

Peaceful spot: Walkers on the remote 3 km track to the scene of the attack outside the village of Chevaline where the Al-Hillis were murdered

In accordance with custom, the women covered their heads and stood back from the graveside, sobbing and clutching soggy bouquets.

The men, oblivious to the cloying mud ruining their suits, banded together with their shovels to create a huge, dome-shaped tomb.

Only one child was present – a boy, believed to be one of Mr and Mrs Al-Hilli’s nephews – but their daughters Zainab, seven, and Zeena, four, who both survived the slaughter, were kept away.

Dusk had fallen by the time the poignant last act in this terrible episode was played out. The three murdered innocents had found some peace at last.
