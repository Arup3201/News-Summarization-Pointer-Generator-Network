A woman has won the Fields Medal for the first time in its 76-year history.

Maryam Mirzakhani, 37, is a professor at Stanford University, and grew up in Tehran, Iran - making her also the first Iranian to get the award.

She received the Medal today during a ceremony at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Seoul, South Korea.

Genius! Maryam Mirzakhani is the first female - and the first Iranian - to win a Fields Medal in its 76-year history

She won for her 'outstanding contributions to the dynamics and geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.'

Known
 as 'the Nobel Prize in mathematics,' the Fields Medal is the award made
 famous in the movie Good Will Hunting when Robin Williams' character 
describes it as 'a really big deal.'

'This is a great honor. I will be happy if it encourages young female scientists and mathematicians,' Mirzakhani told Stanford News. 'I am sure there will be many more women winning this kind of award in coming years.'

The Fields Medal has been awarded to two, three or four mathematicians every four years since its founding in 1938. In order to qualify, scholars must be under 40 years old - a requirement many consider to be the reason no females have won until this point, since it's during peak child-rearing years.

Ms Mirzakhani, who lives in Stanford, California, with her husband and three-year-old daughter, initially wanted to be a writer, according to Quanta Magazine.

By high school, with the help of encouraging teachers, her ambitions shifted. In 1994 and 1995 (when she was 17 and 18), she received gold medals at the International Mathematics Olympiad as part of the Iranian team. The team had never had a female member before.

Her second year in the competition, she received a perfect score - and it became apparent that numbers would be deeply involved in her future.

After receiving her undergraduate degree at Tehran's Sharif University and a graduate degree at Harvard University, she was a research fellow and assistant professor at Princeton University.

Despite her obvious genius, Ms Mirzakhani remains modest. When she got the email saying she had won the Fields Medal, she assumed it was sent from a hacked email account.

'There are really many great female mathematicians doing great things,' she said.to Quanta.

In Good Will Hunting, Dr Gerald Lambeau, played by Stellan Skarsgard, has won the Fields Medal. Dr Lambeau is the person who discovers Will Hunting's (Matt Damon) talent for math after Mr Hunting, a janitor, solves a complicated math problem on his chalkboard at MIT.

Mr Williams' character, Sean Maguire, is professional rivals with Dr Lambeau and calls the honor 'a really big deal.' He also tells Dr Lambeau he can 'shove the medal up his a**.'
