The parents of missing Madeleine McCann thanked the public for their unwavering support today as they marked the seventh anniversary of their daughter's disappearance.

Kate and Gerry McCann were joined by around 100 well-wishers, friends and relatives at a prayer service in the centre of Rothley, Leicestershire.

The open-air service, conducted beside Rothley's War Memorial, saw candles lit for all the children around the world who have been taken away from their parents against their will.

Missing: Madeleine McCann, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007, during a family holiday in Portugal

The McCanns' daughter, Madeleine, then aged three, went missing on May 3, 2007, from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant.

The toddler, who lived in Rothley with her family, had been left in the rented apartment at the seaside Ocean Club resort, along with her twin siblings, Sean and Amelie.

During the half-hour service,Â led by Rothley's Anglican vicar Rob Gladstone, Mrs McCann gave a reading adapted from the words of a song.

'Here we are again, and more significantly, here you are again,' she told those present. 'Having your support has made a huge difference, so thank you.'

Speaking after his wife, Mr McCann added: 'I would just like to echo what Kate said and thank you all for coming to support us over the past seven years.'

Mr McCann also expressed his family's gratitude that the Metropolitan 
Police team investigating Madeleine's disappearance has now moved on to a
 'very active' phase in its inquiry.

'They
 are chipping away and obviously there is new evidence so we are going 
to continue to hope that we will get a happy outcome,' he said.

Speaking
 before the service, Mrs McCann's uncle, Brian Kennedy, 75, said all 
four churches in the village had provided tremendous support to the 
family.

Possible sighting: A street in the Praia Da Luz resort where an Irish holiday maker and his wife claim they saw a mystery person with a child at about the same time as Madeleine McCann disappeared in May 2007

The retired headmaster, who also lives in Rothley, said locals had also been extremely supportive.

Asked
 how he felt on the anniversary of Madeleine's disappearance, he told 
the Press Association: 'Much the same as I was seven years ago - 
hopeful.

'But, as Kate always says, we would just like to know something. The worst part is not knowing where Madeleine is.'

Speaking
 earlier this week, Mrs McCann revealed that she privately returns to 
the Portuguese resort where her daughter disappeared to 'walk those 
streets' and 'look for answers'.

She told the BBC that she returns quietly to Praia da Luz at least once or twice a year to feel close to her eldest daughter, who would now be 10 years old.

Mrs McCann's comments came as she backed a revamped alert system, known as Child Rescue Alerts, which is triggered when missing children are kidnapped or their lives are at risk.

'When a child is abducted, families are devastated and entire communities are torn apart,' she said.

'The agony of not knowing where your child is is almost impossible to imagine.'

She urged members of the public to sign up for system, which will be overhauled later this month.
