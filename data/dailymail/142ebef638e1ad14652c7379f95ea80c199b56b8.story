A terminally ill groom robbed of speech by cancer married his childhood sweetheart by squeezing her hand to say ‘I do’ before he died 11 days later.

William Kent, 24 married Emma, 25, at his hospital bedside despite not being able to speak or blink because of nerve damage caused by the illness.

For six months William, a teacher, fought the disease and would not let it ruin the moment he married Emma who he had proposed to three years ago on Valentine’s Day.

Childhood sweethearts: William and Emma married in a hospital ceremony before he died 11 days later

Instead of saying his vows, he squeezed the registrar’s hand before his father supported his hand so he could make a mark on the marriage register.

Family and friends from Ilkeston’s Ormiston Enterprise Academy, where William taught, crammed into the hospital room after being given just hours’ notice of the ceremony.

Nurses had told William’s family and Emma earlier that day that they could arrange for the wedding to happen to fulfil the couple’s wishes.

William died from lymphoma cancer 11 days after the whirlwind ceremony at Nottingham City Hospital on October 3.

The look of love: William was not able to speak because of his cancer and so had to squeeze the registrar's hand to say 'I do'

Emma, who wore a blue dress for ceremony, said William loved life and was adored by everyone.

She said: ‘The squeeze of the hand was so tight, there was no doubt in my mind at all that he wanted to be married.

‘I rushed into town to buy wedding bands. They only stocked samples so I bought those.

‘The
 wedding meant absolutely everything and it was amazing, I think it 
spurred him on with the strength to keep going for another 11 days.

‘Everyone adored William, he made friends with everyone he met and he had a huge group of friends.

‘He’d
 always act the fool and would spoil a couple of photos pulling faces. 
We first met properly in art classes at sixth form, we started talking 
and then went to a pub quiz together.

‘William was really excited about everything, it was infectious his sense of joy at life, he was a cheeky chappy.’

Happier days: William and Emma met at school as children and started dating in sixth form

He graduated from Leeds Metropolitan University and worked as a teacher before the cancer struck

Emma said after a first round of treatment following the diagnosis in April William took her to eat out almost every night to build up his strength.

She said: ‘When he came out we just ate out everywhere, he wanted to go out and eat. I have never been to so many restaurants in such a short space of time - Chiquitos, Pizza Hut, KFC, everywhere, so he could build his strength up for his next round of chemo.’

Emma and William met at school as children but it was not until the they were in sixth form that they started dating.

While William went to Leeds Metropolitan to study a degree in IT, Emma went to Lincoln to study illustration.

They stayed together and after they graduated, they saved up to buy their first house together in Derby.

For six months, William fought the disease and refused to let it take away the moment he married Emma who he had proposed to three years ago on Valentines Day

He popped the question at his parents’ house in Holbrook in Derbyshire after decorating the room with pictures of beaches, saying he could not afford to take her to the exotic location he wanted to propose in.

In order to save money for a house and because they had started new jobs, they decided to postpone the wedding until 2014.

Their life together was dealt a bitter blow in April when William began getting pains in his arm and coughing.

He went to the doctors who did not find anything wrong with him.

The pain continued, however, and he returned to his GP who referred him to Royal Derby Hospital.

They in turn referred him to Nottingham City Hospital where he was diagnosed with lymphoma, a type of cancer, and began chemotherapy.

His strength declined, and his muscles and immune system weakened, forcing him to stay in hospital.

Adored: William's wife Emma said that he made friends with everyone he met

When he was well enough, he was allowed home to spend the odd day with Emma, his family, and beloved dogs Poppy and Riley.

The hospital tried a new form of treatment for the type of cancer William had but it was unsuccessful.

The cancer spread to his nervous system and brain which stopped his speech.

William’s mother, Helen, said: ‘At 11am on the morning of the wedding they weren’t getting married but then the nurses said how William and Emma had been speaking about it a few weeks beforehand.

‘They said that if they wanted to get married and William’s dad and I agreed, they could fix it for that day.

‘Right to the end he did not get angry or have outbursts. He would still crack jokes. It was a real comfort to us actually.’

William’s sister, Rachel, 26, said: ‘It was a really happy day, a lovely occasion. You might not think of that when you think of a wedding in a hospital but it was, it was really nice.’

William’s father said it had been university which had given William the determination to succeed as a teacher.

He said: ‘He did change. He was the same character but he really got serious about wanting to do things, teaching for him was not just a passion but he had real flair for it. ‘

William was a keen skier and he enjoyed family holidays to France where he showed off his skills.

To his sisters, both older sibling Rachel, and Emily, 15, he was a caring brother.
