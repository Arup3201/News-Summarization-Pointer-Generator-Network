Eden Hazard believes James Milner's impressive display for Manchester City against Chelsea on Sunday was one of the reasons his team couldn't come away with three points.

Chelsea took the lead in the second half thanks to an Andre Schurrle strike before former Blues star Frank Lampard came on to cancel out the German's opener.

Milner's cross for Lampard capped off a brilliant performance which Hazard believed was the difference on Sunday.

He told Chelsea's official website: 'This year [James] Milner defended more on the right-hand side. That made it more difficult for me to attack.

‘Having said that I thought we played well. It’s never easy to play at City. The first half was complicated; we didn’t have much time on the ball.'

Despite feeling deflated after conceding an 84th minute equaliser against City's 10 men, Hazard believes Chelsea's start to the season has been a good one.

The Belgian added: 'We defended well and then we scored another good team goal, which we have been doing a lot this season. We need to continue like that and keep working hard.

‘We stay first in the league, too. Five matches played: four wins and a draw – it’s not a bad start.’
