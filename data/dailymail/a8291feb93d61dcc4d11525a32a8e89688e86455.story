Jermain Defoe joined Sunderland on Friday after spending a year with Toronto FC, and it seems the MLS outfit may have held a slight grudge against their former  striker.

Toronto tweeted ahead of Defoe's Sunderland debut against his ex-club Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane to wish 'our partner Spurs all the best' for the Barclays Premier League match.

They wrote: '#COYS! We wish our partner @SpursOfficial all the best today as they take on Jermain Defoe and Sunderland.'

The striker has signed on a three-year deal from Toronto with Jozy Altidore moving in the other direction

Defoe admitted he will be judged on his goals return after signing for Sunderland in time to make his debut at former club Spurs.

The 32-year-old penned a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Stadium of Light having been convinced to head to the north east by former Tottenham coach Gus Poyet, who he played under previously.

Sunderland are the  Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, and there is pressure on Defoe to hit the ground running given their struggles in front of goal.

Defoe said he is delighted to be at Sunderland and added he is looking forward to the challenge

Defoe said that he always enjoyed coming up to the Stadium of Light on opposing teams
