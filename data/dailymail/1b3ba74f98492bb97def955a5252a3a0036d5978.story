When they first set eyes on the rundown old farmhouse and derelict outbuildings, all Graham  and Susan James wanted to know from a local surveyor was: Will the property fall down before we buy it?

Most people would have baulked at taking on four-and-a-half acres of untamed land, a silted-up pond and crumbling Grade II listed house, but the Jameses were certain the property ‘had our name on it’.

That was 1976. And for the next 38 years, they spent every weekend painstakingly restoring Luxford Farm, near Crowborough in East Sussex, and creating the most beautiful gardens.

Hard work: Graham, 76, and Susan, 74, bought derelict Luxford Farm near Crowborough in East Sussex, in 1976, and after doing it up, are now selling it

At the beginning of each year, Graham would make charts detailing what they would work on, from laying reclaimed floor tiles  to building garden walls.

The couple cheerfully admit that Luxford Farm was not so much a project as an obsession. It became their life’s work.

‘I can honestly say I never resented a single day of it,’ says Graham, now 76. ‘We were both working in London and we had two children – our son was ten and our daughter was 13 when we moved in – so to be here at weekends in this beautiful setting was all we wanted. I’d do it all again.’

Graham did nearly all the work himself, and each brick and stone was recycled or salvaged to ensure authenticity. The result is a beautifully renovated period home that has received a commendation from Sussex Heritage Trust.

Before buying Luxford, the Jameses lived in a 1970s-built house – which they hated –  in nearby Langton Green. They had previously renovated a Regency property in Leamington Spa, but other than that they had no professional training. They are, however, both art college graduates and very creative: Susan was head of the London College of Fashion, while Graham had his own graphic design company.

They bought Luxford for £34,000, having sold their five-bedroom ‘executive home’  for £32,000. ‘We didn’t have a lot of money to fund the work,’ recalls Graham. ‘When we had money, we did what needed to be paid for. When we didn’t, I worked on whatever I could that didn’t cost anything except my labour.’

He says he did everything apart from ‘electrics and serious plastering’. ‘If I didn’t know how to do something, I learnt it so that I could do it properly,’ he adds.

The Jameses had no idea the house had medieval origins until an antiques dealer who came to deliver a table recognised its age from the beamed dining-room ceiling.

It turned out the room dated from the  15th Century, and records showed there were buildings on the site as far back as 1279. The dining room is the oldest part of the house, dominated by a large inglenook fireplace with a bread oven on one side.

The sitting room next door is part of a  16th Century extension, with an even bigger fireplace containing a substantial groove where the residents would sharpen their kitchen knives. There’s also a sunny second sitting room, part of a Victorian extension, as well as a long kitchen and a breakfast room.

An ancient wooden staircase leads up to the first floor, where what was once the biggest bedroom has been dubbed ‘the repository’ by the Jameses, as it’s now stuffed with antique furniture and tapestries.

Yet another inglenook in  this room was discovered only during the couple’s renovations. Two bedrooms, two bathrooms and a dressing room,  all with their own quirky charm, complete this floor, while under the eaves of the top floor are two more large bedrooms as well as a study.

While Graham was busy carrying out the heavy labour, Susan was focusing on the interior, finding exactly the right furniture  for each room. ‘Collecting antique furniture became another obsession,’ she says. ‘We got to know some of the dealers – they would ring us up if they had a piece they thought we’d like.’

The gardens were as much a labour of love as the house. What was once brambles and rubble is now a magical series of connecting courtyards, green lawns, lush borders and a wonderful walled garden.

The once-silted pond now has an elegant curved bridge across the narrowest part. ‘Clearing that pond was one of my least favourite jobs,’ admits Graham. ‘When we moved in you could walk across it on dead trees and bulrushes.’

The couple bought several more acres of land when a neighbour put them on the market, bringing their total to more than  ten acres. ‘We had delusions of grandeur,’ jokes Graham. ‘But it was a chance to protect our view and add to the peaceful tranquillity.’

He has restored all the outbuildings with the same dedicated craftsmanship as the house. The piece de resistance is the oast house, which was just circular brickwork when the couple moved in. It is now a beautiful two-bedroom guesthouse which could easily be turned into holiday accommodation.

The Jameses have reluctantly decided  to sell, putting the house on the market for £1.995 million. Now that Graham is 76 and Susan 74, a large house is more than they want to maintain. More importantly, Graham admits: ‘I haven’t had the same interest in the place since it was finished.’

The couple are proud of their efforts,  and whoever buys Luxford Farm will be the beneficiary of 38 years of loving attention and creative renovation. So where will the couple downsize to  – surely not a 1970s bungalow? ‘We’re open to ideas,’ laughs Graham. ‘But it has to be somewhere that fires our imagination.’
