The eight-year-old daughter of a Newark politician is in a critical condition after she was attacked by a pit bull in her home.

Emily Ruckle was bitten multiple times by the pit bull and suffered severe soft-tissue injuries and blood loss from the attack,  in Stafford neighborhood on Saturday afternoon.

The child, whose father is city Councilman Todd Ruckle, was with her 15-year-old sister when the dog became aggressive.

The animal prevented the two girls, who were home alone, from leaving the room where the attack occurred.

The child, whose father is city Councilman Todd Ruckle (pictured) suffered 'severe soft tissue injuries and bleeding from multiple dog bites' after the incident in Stafford neighborhood on Saturday afternoon

The girl's sister called the emergency services and stemmed the bleeding until paramedics arrived.

When officers arrived they shot the dog dead.

New Castle County paramedics took the girl  to Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Rockland.

She was then flown to Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania, where she was listed in critical condition.

'Today is the hardest day of my life. My daughter is alive and will survive,' Todd Ruckle posted on his Facebook page, reports the Delaware Online.

'She has 4 to 6 hours of surgery with three different teams of surgeons.  

The child was with her 15-year-old sister when the dog became aggressive - the animal prevented the two girls, who were home alone, from leaving the room where the attack occurred

Emily's sister called police and provided medical assistance to her little sister while they waited for paramedics to arrive

'We are praying we can save her arm. I am truly in need of love and support. Please send every ounce of positive thoughts right now.'

Jerry Clifton, a longtime family friend told the website the dog was not the family pet, but was staying at the house.

'She's such a friendly girl. She loves animals and my heart goes out to her family and I feel awful,' said Dee Wagman, family friend told 6ABC.

She said her children would often play at the Ruckle's home, but they 'would ensure me that the dog was locked separately and they would have no contact with that dog,' she said. 

Yesterday the family spokesman issued a statement saying: 'The Ruckle family would like to thank everyone for their thoughts and prayers, but have asked that the media and public respect their privacy during this difficult time.'

The reason for the dog's attack is unclear.
