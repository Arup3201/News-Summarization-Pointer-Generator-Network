Lukas Kamay arriveing at the Supreme Court in Melbourne where he pleaded gulity to insider trading charges that netted him almost $7 mllion

A former National Australia Bank employee who has admitted to stealing $7 million in an elaborate insider trading scheme will fight one of six charges laid against him.

Lukas James Kamay, 26, of Clifton Hill in Melbourne's north east, pleaded guilty to six insider trading charges, but not guilty to the more serious charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime when he appeared in the Victorian Supreme Court on Wednesday.

Defence lawyer Tony Isaacs told the court that Kamay would apply to have a permanent stay on the charge if it was not withdrawn.

Kamay and a friend Christopher Russell Hill, who worked for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, allegedly worked together to trade confidential market-sensitive information that netted about $7 million in profits.

Hill, 24, has previously pleaded guilty to six charges in the Melbourne Magistrates Court.

Police allege that Hill, of Belconnen in the ACT, used his position with the ABS to access data on the labour force and retail trade to predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar before it was made publicly available.

He then passed it to his university friend Kamay in Melbourne, who used the information to make foreign exchange derivative trades.

In court on Wednesday, Defence lawyer Tony Isaacs said Kamay would fight the charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime.

'He has made full confessions, full admissions,' Mr Isaacs said on Wednesday.

'We simply say this is charging a thief with handling stolen goods.'

Kamay and Hill are friends from Monash University and are accused of making net profit of $6.98 million over eight months between August last year and May this year by using advanced knowledge of government data.

Hill used his position as Canberra-based ABS employee to allegedly give Kamay information about official data releases on jobs, building approvals, capital expenditure and retail sales.

Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk

Documents tendered to the court show Kamay bought an Albert Park unit featured on TV show The Block for $2.375 million.

Kamay allegedly offered Hill $50,000 to give him the ABS data and would use this information to 'predict fluctuations in the Australian dollar'.

He would buy foreign exchange derivative contracts minutes before the ABS's data release at 11.30am and would sell them shortly afterwards.The men were arrested in May as part of a joint AFP and ASIC investigation.

Hill worked at the NAB's foreign exchange desk Kamay, of Clifton Hill, worked for NAB in Melbourne on the foreign exchange desk but was not involved in derivatives trading, while Hill started with the ABS in January 2011 as a technical statistics expert preparing labour force and employment reports.

After Hill was charged, The Australian Bureau of Statistics admitted it was difficult to counter the threat of a trusted insider leaking market-sensitive information.

At a Senate estimates hearing on earlier this year ABS acting statistician Jonathan Palmer defended security protocols in place, describing the breach as unprecedented in the bureau's 100-year history.

'Fortunately in this case police were clear that this person acted alone,' he said.

'That gives me some level of confidence.'

The bureau has recruited Belinda Gibson, former deputy chair of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, to conduct a review.

Staff must sign undertakings and declarations when they begin employment to show they are aware they risk jail if they leak sensitive information.

Mr Palmer said there were strict access controls on sensitive information and the bureau reviews access logs. They were granted bail to face a directions hearing in the Victorian Supreme Court on October 1.
