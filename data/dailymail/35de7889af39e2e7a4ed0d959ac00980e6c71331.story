Many pregnant women are prone to feeling uncomfortable in the hot weather.

So poor Frankie Sandford must have been positively sweltering as she managed to perform in the blistering sunshine in a jacket and black dress.

The singer, who is six months pregnant with her first child, braved the soaring 29C temperatures as she danced with her Saturdays bandmates at the Barclaycard British Summer Time festival in London's Hyde Park.

Working up a sweat: The singer must have been sweltering in her warm outfit

While Frankie, 24, was covered up on the hottest day of the year, her bandmates were dressed a lot more summery in colourful vests and mini skirts.

Her bandmate Rochelle Humes, 24, asked the audience to give an extra cheer for Frankie, who was clearly feeling hot.

She said: 'Give it up for Frankie, she's heavily pregnant and really struggling in the heat.'

Wowing the crowd: The five-piece performed their recent No.1 What About Us and new single Gentlemen

Mollie King, 26, then piped up: 'That's really harsh.'

However, Rochelle added: 'But she's wearing all black and the highest heels out of all of us.'

Frankie was adamant she loved her heels too much: 'I'm not ready to give up the heels just yet.'

Good spirits: Frankie is expecting her first child in October

Singing her heart out: Frankie belts out a verse

Perhaps Frankie's chose her outfit after recently admitting she felt self-conscious about her changing body.

She said last month: 'I'm having to get used to my body changing. If I wasn't on stage and being photographed all the time, I think I'd be more relaxed.

'I've always wanted bigger boobs, but now I've actually got them, I don't know how I feel about them.'

Last week, Frankie revealed she was due in October, her first child with footballer fiance Wayne Bridge, who also has a son Jaydon, six, with ex-girlfriend Vanessa Perroncel.

Back on stage: This weekend saw Rochelle's first live performances since returning from maternity leave

Summer daze: The girls have been supportive of Frankie during her pregnancy

Frankie will be the third Saturday to become a mother - Una Healy is mother to Aoife, 16 months, while Rochelle welcomed Alaia-Mai on May 20.

While the girl group weren't on stage, they were watched Andy Murray clinch his Wimbledon title, which was especially enjoyed by tennis fan Mollie.

Rochelle posted a photo of Mollie crying with happiness backstage on her Instagram, writing: '@MollieTheSats crying at Murray's success haha I had to tweet..sorry. love u moll xx.'

I'm back! New mother Rochelle Humes looked like she was loving being back on stage

The group's gig comes 24 hours after they performed at the Ray Of Sunshine concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

It marked Rochelle's first live gig since she returned from maternity leave to have her daughter Alaia-Mai.

She tweeted: 'Performing at Hyde Park was amazing yesterday. Alaia-Mai's very first concert, watching Mummy, Daddy and her Aunties and Uncles.'

Promotional: The Saturdays' new single Gentleman entered the UK charts on Sunday at No.14

She showed off her post-baby curves in a lime vest, animal-print skirt and Dune Alvino court shoes.

Meanwhile, Una, who wore a pretty 
headdress from Rock 'N Rose and Bertie Pilda boots, also posted a cute 
photo of her daughter Aoife backstage at the Hyde Park gig.

All of the group dazzled in the sunlight with Swarovski jewellery.
