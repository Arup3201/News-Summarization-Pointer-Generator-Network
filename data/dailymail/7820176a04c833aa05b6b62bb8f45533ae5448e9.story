A man from Massachusstes was arrested on Saturday night for allegedly hitting a snow plow driver on the head with a shovel.

Douglas Haskell, 40, has been arrested for assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.

He allegedly whacked snow plow driver on the head with a snow shovel on Saturday night on Churchill Road in Lakeville, Massachusetts.

The weapon: Haskell hit the snow plow driver on the head with a shovel who then suffered from a cut above his left eye

The plow driver did not suffer any serious injuries and it's unclear as to what exactly fueled the attack.

Haskell was arraigned today and was later released. He is due back in court on March 27.

Even though police are not certain what triggered Haskell's 'snow rage' they believe that Haskell may have been upset when the plow driver pushed snow onto his side of the street.

After the two bickered, Haskell allegedly hit the snow plow driver on the head and shoulder reports The Smoking Gun.[related]

The snow plow driver wouldn't let the Lakeville Police Department take him to the hospital but suffered a cut above his left eye.

The identity of the snow plow driver has not been released.

CBS reports that this was not the only violence against a snow plow driver that occurred this month.

Last week in Lakeville, Pennsylvania a 64-year-old man allegedly put a gun to a snow plow driver's head after he shoveled snow into his backyard.

The attack occurred in Lakeville, Massachusetts just 40 miles outside of Boston
