The Texas teen who fell asleep at the wheel and caused a crash which killed his parents and three of his five siblings, will not be charged in the fatal accident.

Oauchita and Morehouse, Louisana District Attorney Jerry Jones dismissed the careless driving charge against the 16-year-old, saying he had been punished enough by the loss of his family.

The teen from Terrell, Texas was taking a turn driving to Walt Disney World when he fell asleep at the wheel Wednesday night and crashed the family's SUV near Calhoun, Louisiana.

Parents Trudi and Michael Hardman died at the scene, as well as sons Adam, 7, and Dakota, 15, and 4-year-old daughter Kaci.

Troopers said he drove left into the median just before 11pm and then tried to get back onto the highway but overcorrected, causing the 2005 Chevrolet Tahoe to roll over.

They said six of the eight people in the SUV were thrown from the vehicle.

None of those killed wore seat belts but the driver did, officials said. 

Ouachita Parish coroners pronounced the five family members dead on the scene.

'Our heartfelt condolences go out to all of the people affected by this tragic crash,' said Col. Mike Edmonson, the Louisiana State Police superintendent.

'In an instance this family vacation turned into an unspeakable tragedy.'

Troopers said they did not suspect the young driver was impaired, but a toxicology sample was taken.

Mrs Hardman, was a kindergarten teacher at Wills Point ISD, and her husband was a second-grade teacher at Terrell ISD.

In a Facebook post Thursday, Wills Point ISD wrote: 'Words cannot express the sadness in our hearts today. … The impact of the tragedy is far reaching and has effected each campus,' the post read.

Hardman also was a little league baseball coach who coached his sons, one of whom, 12-year-old Aaron Hardman, was in critical condition at a Shreveport hospital, Timothy Hardman said.

He said the two other injured children were treated at the hospital and released Thursday morning.

'He never turned a kid away,' Timothy Hardman said of his brother. 'Michael probably had the biggest heart of anybody you ever knew. He just loved kids.'

French said a counselor contacted the parents of students in Michael Hardman's class to let them know about his death, and counselors also are available to support both staff and students.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family members, colleagues, students and friends,' he said. 'We must lift each other up during this difficult time,' French said.

Trudi Hardman was a kindergarten teacher at Wills Point Primary school, and had worked for the Wills Point Independent School District for about 10 years, Superintendent Suzanne Blasingame said in an email.

Blasingame said Michael Hardman also had formerly taught at Wills Point Primary.

'Our school and community is grieving for this family,' said Blasingame, who had traveled to Louisiana to be with the family. 'We will continue to lift this family up in our prayers.'

Timothy Hardman, 38, of Crandall, Texas, said his brother and Trudi Hardman were married about five years ago and had six children between them. Michael Hardman had three boys from a previous marriage, while Trudi Hardman had two boys from a previous marriage, Timothy Hardman said. The couple had a daughter, Kaci, together, he said.

Timothy Hardman, who traveled to Terrell after he was notified of the accident, said his brother's family had scheduled the trip about nine months ago, and had planned to stay at Disney World for a week.

'They've always talked about it,' he said. 'It was their dream trip. It was an opportunity for them to take all of their kids.'
