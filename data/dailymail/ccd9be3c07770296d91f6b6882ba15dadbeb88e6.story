On Monday at 10 am, California Highway Patrol officers pulled over a vehicle for a traffic stop on the common smuggling route of Interstate 5 at Coalinga.

When police noticed that both the occupants were acting suspiciously, they used the drug-sniffing dogs of their K9 division to search the car.

They discovered that 15 bottles of liquid, labelled in Spanish as tequila, in fact contained a huge amount of methamphetamine.

A new trend: California Highway Patrol seized $500,000 worth of methamphetamine disguised in 15 tequila bottles on Monday

The Highway Patrol often uses sniffing dogs on the Interstate 5 due to its importance as a drug corridor from Mexico to the US and Canada.

Police, however, have noted a new trend. Mexican cartels are increasingly sending drugs north disguised in liquid form.

This is the biggest example yet – it is estimated that this 56-pound haul of liquid meth would be worth more than half a million dollars on the streets.

Highway patrol spokesman Matt Radke told KFSN: 'At this level of amount, it is going to be distributed all over the place. Once it gets to the final form, the powdered form, it's going to be disseminated throughout the country.'

Rene Diaz, 22, and Veronica Carrasco, 38, both of Oregon, were arrested at the scene and will now face drug charges

Police arrested Rene Diaz, 22, and Veronica Carrasco, 38. They told officers they had started their journey in Southern California and were heading to their home state of Oregon.

Radke stated: ‘These two suspects gave indications of basically just being transporters for whoever they are working for and a lot of times in these instances they don't know each other.’

The pair are being currently held in Fresno County Jail and will face drugs charges. The bottles of ‘tequila’ have been fingerprinted and will be used as evidence.
