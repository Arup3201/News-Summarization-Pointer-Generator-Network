Royal Bank of Scotland has called in lawyers to investigate claims it ruined successful small firms to maximise its own profits.

The state-backed lender has hired legal firm Clifford Chance after a damning report said it acted like a ‘hit squad’ by deliberately causing healthy businesses to go bust.

Business Secretary Vince Cable said he was 'appalled' by the claims which Chancellor George Osborne said were 'shocking'.

It is understood the allegations focus on RBS' Global Restructuring Group (GRG) lending division, which handles loans classed as being risky

RBS and Lloyds faced claims they ‘harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall’.

In the worst cases, RBS withdrew lines of credit for previously solvent firms by charging eye-watering fees and charges so it could then seize their assets – typically property – at knockdown prices.

Lloyds Banking Group is also singled out in the extraordinary allegations in an independent report commissioned by the Government.

Entrepreneur Lawrence Tomlinson was asked by Mr Cable to look into small business lending.

He accuses many of Britain’s banks of ‘heavy-handed profiteering and abhorrent behaviour’. 

Mr Cable has passed the report 
to Sir Andrew Large - the former deputy governor of the Bank of England,
who has also published his full review into small business lending at 
RBS today.

A spokeswoman for RBS - 80 per cent owned by the taxpayer - confirmed that it had now hired law firm Clifford Chance to look into the claims.

Ross McEwan, the banking group’s new chief executive, confirmed lawyers had been called in in a a letter to Sir Andrew.

He did not make direct reference to the Tomlinson report, but wrote: 'To ensure our customers can have full confidence in our commitment to them, I have asked the law firm Clifford Chance to conduct an inquiry into this matter, reporting back to me in the new year.'

Royal Bank of Scotland staff are turning away too many small business loans at an early stage partly because they face increasing sanctions for putting through applications that 'turn bad', a review has found.

The report by former Bank of England deputy governor Sir Andrew Large found that up to 10 per cent of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) rejected at a pre-application stage may in fact be suitable for financing.

It means that while state-backed RBS performs better than other lenders on dealing with SME loan applications, this is partly due to the fact that it screens out more potential borrowers before the application stage, Sir Andrew found.

The report also made reference to accusations about the bank 'hastening the failure of businesses' in some cases that are also the subject of a report by Business Secretary Vince Cable's adviser Lawrence Tomlinson.

SME financing is critical because it is seen as key to a sustainable economic recovery.

But overall RBS, which is 80 per cent-owned by the taxpayer, converted one in four of all business approaches into lending, slightly lower than the market average.

He admitted RBS 'over-corrected for the reckless lending practices that broke this bank five years ago'.

'We can never return to those days again and your report recognises the steps we have taken to re-balance and stabilise the bank.

'But in many cases the pendulum of risk aversion has swung too hard to one side. As you have identified, there are loans that we could, and should, be making, but are not.'

Last night Mr Tomlinson said if it was proved there was ‘systematic and institutional fraud’ at the banks, ‘you should see people going to jail’.

His
report reserved its most damning criticism for taxpayer-backed RBS and 
Lloyds.

He said: ‘It is undeniable that some of the banks, RBS and 
Lloyds in particular, are harming their customers through their 
decisions and causing their financial downfall.’  

The
allegation will be a major embarrassment for both lenders and the 
Government, which owns an 82 per cent stake in RBS and 43 per cent in 
Lloyds.

Mr 
Tomlinson, the founding chairman of the LNT Group, which employs more 
than 2,000 people, told Channel 4 News: ‘We’re really concerned that the
businesses aren’t really struggling and are pushed over the edge. And 
then these extra fees tip them over administration, and then you’ve got 
the loss of jobs but end up with RBS owning the property.

‘If it is proved that this is systemic
and institutional fraud, and there is quite a lot of evidence from 
people within the bank that this is the case, then the relevant action 
should be taken. If people have had their livelihoods stolen from them, 
you should see people going to jail.’

The report claims to have uncovered 
‘very concerning patterns of behaviour leading to the destruction of 
good and viable UK businesses’.

It suggests RBS engineered businesses 
to default on their loans to move them into a special division called 
Global Restructuring Group (GRG).

Once in GRG the firms were then hit 
with exorbitant rates and fees, which in some cases caused them to 
collapse, allowing RBS to buy their property and assets on the cheap, 
the report claims.

Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds ¿harmed their customers through their decisions and caused their financial downfall¿, according to the bombshell report

Eddie Warren and his wife Cheryl lost more than £1million, their livelihood and their marriage after borrowing from RBS.

The
couple bought the Bold Hotel in Southport in 2007 for £3.7 million, 
using £1.2million of their own money and  taking out a loan from the 
bank.

A
condition of the loan was that they had to take out an interest rate 
swap to protect them when base rates increased, but this led to them 
paying high fixed interest on their loans and an additional £120,000 a 
year in penalties as rates tumbled. After the hotel was placed in RBS’s 
Global Restructuring Group it was valued at just £1.8 million. By the 
autumn of 2011, the business was pushed into administration.

RBS property company West Register bought the hotel for £1.4 million several months later.

The
bank claims the business may only just break even when it is sold but 
Mr Warren says it could soon be worth £4 million as the property market 
recovers.

He said: ‘They stole it. Even if the property market was depressed it would be worth £3 million.’

Mr Cable said he was 'appalled' by what Mr Tomlinson found.

'I was appalled by what he said... just to explain Lawrence Tomlinson is what we call an entrepreneur in residence.

'He’s
a Yorkshire businessperson who had himself had a lot of problems with 
RBS but he compiled a dossier of cases which suggested that there was a 
systematic pattern here going back to 2009 where good companies which 
weren’t bringing enough fee income to the bank were being brought down 
deliberately.'

Mr Tomlinson said he was calling for ‘immediate action to stop this unscrupulous treatment of businesses’.

The report recommends that RBS and 
Lloyds be made significantly smaller, removing conflicts of interest 
within the banks, and creating a number of smaller, purely retail 
commercial banks.

The Mail launched its Make the Banks 
Lend campaign three years ago, to highlight the plight of small firms in
accessing credit, but Mr Tomlinson’s findings show many small 
businesses are still being unfairly treated.

Mr Cable said evidence 
against RBS in the report had been referred to the Financial Conduct 
Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ 
Alliance, said: ‘This is shocking news for taxpayers who bailed out 
these banks to the tune of billions of pounds.’

A spokesman for RBS said: ‘GRG 
successfully turns around most of the businesses it works with, but in 
all cases is working with customers at a time of significant stress in 
their lives.

'Not all businesses that encounter serious financial trouble
can be saved.’

A spokesman for Lloyds said: ‘The 
specific practices discussed in the report are attributed to another 
bank and are not a reflection of Lloyds Banking Group’s approach.’
