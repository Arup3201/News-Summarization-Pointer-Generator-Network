A Catholic high school teacher suspended last week after a racy skit on the ‘Tonight Show’ has been reinstated.

Introduced by host Jay Leno as an audience member taking part in a ‘sizzle reel’ skit, Steve Endemano is featured in a fake movie trailer for an anti-steroids film. The risqué ending caused Whittier Christian High School in La Habra, CA., to be suspended, but has been returned to the classroom after a groundswell of support from students.

Mr Endemano, 64, is depicted as a cycling enthusiast who wants to turn pro, and believes he can win without taking steroids.

Oh my God: A student tells Steve Endemano 'they're huge' after he drops his towel

.Initially removed from the classroom for the skit, which ended with him in a locker room dropping a towel and a student saying ‘oh my God, they’re huge,’ the teacher and coach has been allowed to return for his 35th year at the school.

When first introduced, Mr Endemano explained he teaches Bible, calculus and physics, and that he dreamed of being a professional cyclist.

‘I love to ride bikes, I ride bikes all the time, and I would love to be a professional cyclist’ he told Mr Leno, before adding that he’s ‘only 64.’

The talk show host then introduces the faux trailer for ‘Get Some Balls: The Steve Endemano Story.’

The trailer shows Mr Endemano’s disappointment in disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong admitting having taken performance enhancing drugs in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

‘Lance! Why?’ Mr Endemano yells out.

The voiceover then says ‘one 64-year-old man is determined to beat father time,’ before Mr Endamano is shown riding a bike and training before eventually ending up in a locker room with the city champ, whom he calls ‘dirty’ for taking steroids.

Mr Enemano then drops his towel and the student says ‘they’re huge,’ to which the teacher replies ‘and they’re comin’ for you.’

The school suspended the teacher shortly after skit aired.

Students responded by creating a Facebook page demanding he be reinstated, and several students who spoke to local media agreed that while regrettable, the skit should not result in his dismissal.

‘I think he should come back to school, because we miss him as a teacher, and he’s great to have on campus,’ a student told KTLA before Mr Endemano was reinstated.

He’s just overall a good teacher, I love him, another student said.

‘Come back Mr Endemano,’ said another student.

The effort appears to have paid off, as Mr Ednemano will be in class after only a week suspension.
