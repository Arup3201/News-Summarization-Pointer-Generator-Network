Article, written by editors Fiona Godlee, Tim Delamo and Rosamund Snow, argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised, very few patients would chose to end their lives this way

Doctors should be allowed to help terminally ill patients to die, one of Britain’s most influential medical journals says today.

But the BMJ’s call for assisted suicide to be legalised provoked immediate alarm and anger in the profession.

In an editorial, the publication – formerly the British Medical Journal – says the terminally ill must be allowed to ‘call time on their lives’ when it is in their best interests.

Senior doctors warned that such a change in the law will pressurise the elderly into wanting to end their lives for fear of being a burden on their relatives.

The British Medical Association, Royal College of Physicians and Royal College of GPs – all oppose assisted suicide and polls show most doctors share the same view.

A recent survey by the Royal College of GPs found that almost 80 per cent of family doctors opposed a law change to allow assisted dying.

The BMJ is owned by the BMA but has editorial independence.

The article, written by editors Fiona Godlee, Tim Delamo and Rosamund Snow, argues that even if assisted suicide was legalised, very few patients would chose to end their lives this way.

It states: ‘People should be able to exercise choice over their lives, which should include how and when they die, when death is imminent.

‘Recognition of an individual’s right to determine his or her best interests lies at the heart of this journal’s strategy to advance the patient revolution in healthcare.’

The authors refer to Oregon state in the US, where assisted suicide has been legal since 1997.

Only 71 patients there took  life-ending medication last  year, the equivalent in Britain to one patient for every GP practice, they claim.

They quote figures from the British Social Attitudes Survey of 2010 which found 82 per cent supported assisted dying. It is the first time the BMJ has publicly backed assisted dying and the article follows calls from a leading doctor yesterday for medical staff to be trained to end lives.

Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said the law should be changed to allow medics to help patients die without fear of prosecution and there should be health professionals equivalent to midwives to administer fatal doses of medicine.

‘Just as midwives help babies come into the world, some terminally ill patients in pain may seek the help of a health professional to end their life,’ he said. But Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP committee said: ‘Doctors’ key role is to protect the vulnerable.

‘What we want to avoid is a situation where older people feel pressurised into requesting assisted suicide because they feel they are a burden to their relatives.’

Former surgeon Dr Peter Saunders, of the campaign group Care Not Killing, said: ‘The BMJ is completely out of step with the medical profession. The current law exists to protect the vulnerable and those without a voice: Disabled, terminally ill and elderly people, who might otherwise feel pressured into ending their lives.’

Dr Mark Porter, chairman of the BMA council, said: ‘There are strongly held views within the medical profession on both sides of this complex and emotive issue. 

‘The BMA remains firmly opposed to legalising assisted dying. This issue has been regularly debated at the BMA’s policy forming annual conference and recent calls for a change in the law have persistently been rejected.’

Dr Maureen Baker, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, said: ‘Good palliative and terminal care does not require assisted dying.’

The issue will be debated by the House of Lords this month under a Bill, put forward by Labour peer Lord Falconer, which would allow terminally ill patients with less than six months to live to end their lives with a fatal dose of medicine.

They would first have to get a form signed by two doctors.

Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence in England and Wales, technically punishable by up to 14 years in prison.

The practice has been legal in the Netherlands since 2002 and around 4,000 patients a year end their lives in this way.
