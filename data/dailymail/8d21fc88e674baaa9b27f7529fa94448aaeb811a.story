Celebrities are inadvertently stoking a boom in 'sexting' among teenagers, a child protection chief has warned (posed by  model)

Celebrities are inadvertently stoking a boom in 'sexting' among teenagers, a child protection chief has warned.

Schoolchildren are copying trends to text sexually explicit messages and pictures in the same manner as some celebrities and adults, Dr Zoe Hilton has told MPs. 

She told the Commons Education Committee that the trend could potentially harm children who do not understand the dangerous implications of sharing the explicit images.

Dr Hilton said: 'Obviously children and particularly older children are looking at celebrities and are looking at what the adult population are doing', the Telegraph reports. 

She added: 'I think we've got to the point with older teenagers where sexting is a normative behaviour. 

'What we need to do is get them to recognise when it's abusive, when it's harmful, when it's linked to exploitation, when it's linked to the beginning point of an exploitative relationship.'

She added, however, that some people will carry on regardless of 'all the safety messages in the world'. 

It comes after experts at an NSPCC debate warned that the fashion for imitating the sexy selfies taken by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian was putting children at risk of abuse.

And earlier this week Home Secretary Theresa May warned that sending a single 'sext' or sexual online message to an under-16 could become illegal. 

Ms May has asked officials to carry out an 'urgent' review on whether the law needs to be tightened.

At present there is no specific offence against an adult sexual messaging with under-16s, except when it contains graphic images, or if an adult attempts to meet up with their victim to engage them in a sexual act.

Campaigners argue it is vital to close this loophole so offenders can be stopped before they have a chance to groom their potential victim.

Kim Kardashian has recently been singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body

Miss Kardashian's habit of posting explicit sexual images of herself on the internet is said to be encouraging young girls to do the same and making them vulnerable to online predators.

The reality TV star found herself singled out for criticism at an NSPCC debate last week, because she is notorious for sharing provocative images of her body with her 25million Twitter followers on a daily basis.

Last week she generated headlines around the world by posing naked for a magazine shoot, with the pictures circulating freely on the internet.

Nazir Afzal – the chief prosecutor for the North West of England who helped bring the Rochdale grooming gang to justice in 2012 for abusing up to 47 girls – said Miss Kardashian was tempting young girls into sexualising themselves and presenting opportunities to predators.

His comments were echoed by Government adviser Reg Bailey, chief executive of the Mothers' Union, who was also at the event held at the London School of Economics. 

Mr Bailey said the prevalence for sexting and sending sexual imagery among teenagers had become normalised, and raised his concerns that many 'indecent child images are actually self-generated'.

Talking about the girls who become influenced by celebrities, Mr Afzal said: 'The sexualisation of children does not help. The reality is that younger and younger children these days are now exposed to the kinds of things, I saw Kim Kardashian a couple of days ago [the magazine images].

'It's those kinds of things, role models out there saying this is the way to live your lives. But unfortunately, [predatory] men want that to happen, want them to believe that's the way to be, that men can interfere with them and damage them in some way.'

Mr Bailey added: 'The idea of what was regarded as pornography, and what you see being very much available now, is very, very different. And it does worry me too, about sexting and sexualised imagery in text messaging, roughly a third of the images that [police] are picking up in terms of indecent child images are actually self-generated, and that's really worrying.'

Miss Kardashian, who is worth an estimated £43million, is married to rapper Kanye West. The pair have a daughter, North West.
