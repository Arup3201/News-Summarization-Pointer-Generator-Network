Mark Burrows (pictured) has been left in need of round-the-clock care after being paralysed by Joshua Corker

A judge has allowed a drunken thug who paralysed a stranger with a single punch to walk free from court.

Mark Burrows, 35, was left with devastating brain injuries after the assault by Joshua Corker, and needs 24-hour care.

He is unable to move his limbs or talk and his family are said to be suffering a ‘living nightmare’.

The victim’s father wept in court as Corker, 23, was released with a two-year suspended prison sentence on Friday.

Mr Burrows, a scaffolder from Wigan, was enjoying a night out with a friend in Sheffield in April last year when he passed a group of men singing football songs and is believed to have commented on Sheffield United losing a match.

Corker, who was among the group and drunk at the time, floored him with a single punch to the face.

Mr Burrows suffered head injuries and a fractured neck and underwent complex surgery before being connected to a life support machine. 

The victim was moved to a high-dependency
 unit, where he remains, but has suffered life-changing and permanent 
disabilities that mean he will require round-the-clock care for the rest
 of his life.

The victim’s family have been trying to 
raise money for equipment to care for him at home, while Corker is now 
on course for a successful career, having completed a degree in 
construction management and been promoted by employer Barratt Homes.

Corker, of Sheffield, pleaded guilty to grievous bodily harm.

Despite the devastating consequences of the assault, the judge allowed the young graduate to escape custody.

Judge Simon Lawler, who described the case told him: ‘This is a tragic case for all involved.

'While Mr Burrows’ family are understandably devastated, you are too.

Tragic: The life of Mark Burrows, pictured before the attack, has been 'transformed' said his mother

'You
 are of positive, very good character. I suspect you were 
uncharacteristically inhibited by drink.

‘No sentence can bring back what has come to pass.

'I cannot say the public interest of the family demands I sentence you to immediate custody.’

Corker must complete 270 hours of unpaid work and a six-month curfew order imposed on him.

After the case Detective constable Joanne
 de la Torre of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This is a particularly 
tragic case.

'The life of a young man and his family have been changed 
forever due to what was a single punch, thrown in an alcohol-fuelled fit
 of anger.

‘He can no longer move or talk and it is unclear as to 
whether he will any be any better than he is today.’

In a family 
statement, the victim’s mother Mrs Burrows said their ‘hearts have been 
ripped out.’

She said: ‘My son has been through a hellish time. He has 
fought for his life on many occasions and has been at the brink of 
death.

‘He was looking forward to settling down in the future with a 
family of his own. Now, after all these months, we do not know if he 
will be any better than he is today.

'One thing is sure, he will never be
 the same young man again.’
