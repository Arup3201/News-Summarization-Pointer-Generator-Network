A father is pleading with Google to remove a satellite image of the body of his 14-year-old son who was murdered in 2009.

Jose Barrera said the picture on Google Earth shows his son Kevin, who was found battered and shot to death beside train tracks in Richmond, California four years ago.

'When I see this image, that's still like
 that happened yesterday,' the distraught father told KTVU. 'And that brings me back to a 
lot of memories.'

Grisly reminder: The body of 14-year-old Kevin Barrera can be seen on this Google Earth image. His body, which has been blurred by MailOnline, is at the bottom of the image as officers gather above

Mr Barrera learned of the grisly image, which shows his son lying on the ground with a police car parked nearby and officers standing close to his body, earlier this week.

He is now asking the internet giant to take down the image out of respect and said he plans to lodge a complaint if they fail to do so.

Google has yet to respond to MailOnline's request for a comment.

Technology analyst Rob Enderle told KTVU that it is unlikely Google will pull the image.

'When they remove it for one person 
for one thing, then how do they not do it for others?' he asked. 'And so
 they've found it easier just to say no.'

Distraught: Jose Barrera is pleading with Google to remove the image, saying it brings back terrible memories

Victim: His son Kevin was beaten and shot to death. No one has been arrested for the killing

Kevin Barrera was found shot dead just off the railroad tracks in August 2009 - in the area which was known for trouble. Six people were killed there between February and October of that year.

The teenager, who was known to police, had spent the evening of August 14 with his family but left alone on foot after getting some phone calls.

His body was found at 7am the next morning by a passerby. No arrests have been made in his death.

'I don't know the right words to say how I feel," his father told the Contra Costa Times after the murder. 'My heart is really broke.'

Scene: His body was found on August 15, 2009 in a notoriously troubled area of Richmond, California

His step-mother, Leticia Marquez, told a crowd after the death: 'All you kids who are Kevin's age, please help us. Please help your brothers and sisters, because they are looking for kids your age. They are taking our kids. This age is the right time for bad people to take our sons from us.'

His death was the 33rd homicide victim in Richmond in 2009. By the end of the year, 47 people had been killed there, placing it as the second deadliest city after New Orleans.
