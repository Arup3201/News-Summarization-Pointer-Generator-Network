Former Labour Chancellor Denis Healey, photographed by Kalpesh Lathrigra for the New Statesman, still has strident views about today's political leaders

The famously bushy eyebrows have faded to grey and Denis Healey’s 95 years seem to be weighing heavily on him.

But the old political bruiser’s capability for withering putdowns and candid comment has clearly not diminished, as a remarkable interview reveals.

Ed Miliband ‘lacks his brother’s charisma’, Ukip are ‘b******s’ and Margaret Thatcher was thought to be ‘brilliant and good-looking’, he said yesterday.

The former Labour chancellor and deputy leader – who turns 96 this year – delivered a blistering assessment of the current class of politicians.

Lord Healey of Riddlesden as he is now known, was broadly complimentary about the current Labour leader.

But he added: ‘His only disadvantage is that he doesn’t have the charisma of his brother, David. But he doesn’t upset people.’

Lord Healey’s political career spanned more than six decades, from the immediate aftermath of the Second World War during which he had served in the Army, to the fall of Communism.

He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1974 and 1979, before being ousted by a Tory party led to victory by Margaret Thatcher.

He revealed that an MP friend had told him in the 1970s to watch out for an up-and-coming politician, Margaret Thatcher.

He said the friend had told him, ‘“She’s good-looking but she’s also politically brilliant.” He was right.’

Lord Healey told the New Statesman, which also carried this  extraordinary portrait of the peer, with his famously bushy eyebrows now bleached with age, that he was not a fan of Ukip. But he said the party had the power to change British politics.

Lord Healey insisted he does not follow British politics closely, but said Ed Miliband lacked the charm of his brother David and warned of the rise of the UK Independence Party

Lord Healey reveals how a friend told him to keep an eye out for a 'good looking' Tory called Margaret Tatcher, who went on to force him out of his job as Chancellor in the 1979 election

Famous for his bushy eyebrows, wit and a love of photography, Denis Healey remains one of the most well-known figures in Labour's history.

Born in 1917, he attended Bradford Grammar School before studying at Balliol College, Oxford. He joined the army in 1940, serving in North Africa and Italy during World War Two.

Elected an MP for Leeds East in at a by-election in 1952, Under Harold Wilson he served as Defence Secretary from 1964-70, until Labour lost power.

When Roy Jenkins quit as shadow chancellor, Healey was promoted to the role and when Wilson narrowly won the 1974 election he became Chancellor during a period of relentless political and economic crisis.

During his time at the Treasury he was forced to go to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout, something still used against the Labour party today.

For three years was also deputy leader after defeating Tony Benn in a dramatic battle over the direction of the party. He supported Tony Blair as Labour leader but later called on him to stand aside for Gordon Brown.

He was married for more than 60 years to Edna, who died in 2010 aged 92. They had three children.

Healey is credited with creating the First Law Of Holes: 'If you find yourself in a hole, stop digging.'

‘I think they’re b******s but like 
the fascists did at one time, they can start to shift politics,’ he 
said, adding that leader Nigel Farage seems to have ‘a very effective 
personality which will hurt the Tories’.

Despite his criticism of Ukip, the 
former chancellor was sceptical about the future of the EU and said a 
division running along the ‘olive line’ made federation ‘impossible’. 
‘North of the line where olives grow, people pay their taxes and control
their spending; south of it, they don’t and they get very heavily into 
debt,’ he said.

In contrast to some Tory 
backbenchers, Lord Healey praised David Cameron as ‘the first real Tory 
leader since Thatcher’. The only politicians who impressed him from the 
rest of the  government, however, were Vince Cable and Nick Clegg, both 
of whom he described as ‘very able’.

But ahead of the next election, the Liberal Democrats would have to quit the Coalition, he said.
He added that few of today’s politicians had ‘hinterland’ – a depth of character to give substance to their policies.
‘In my time, people didn’t start earning money until well into their 
life in politics. Now … they don’t have experience of the real world.’  
He spoke of his own bruising time with the hard Labour left, when he was
deputy to Michael Foot, saying: ‘In those days, the unions had far too 
much influence.

‘They could really veto anything they didn’t like. And that time  has gone.’

During the interview, the peer and amateur photographer jokingly suggested he could take his clothes off for his photos.
