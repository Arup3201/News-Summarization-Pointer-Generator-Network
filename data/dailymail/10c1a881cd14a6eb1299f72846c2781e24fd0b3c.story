The prestigious university - regularly 
ranked among the world's best - was not immediately available for 
comment on the incident, which happened on Friday night.

But concerns have been raised over levels of binge drinking during freshers' week in the city, with police drafting in extra man power in time for the influx of new students.

A video of the alleged incident shows the rapper turn to the crowd and say: 'Are we going to have a f***ing good time tonight, or what?'

The 30-year-old performer was headlining the Welcome Ball at Durham University, in front of around 300 students.

A
 number of videos shot by freshers show the star abandoning a song half 
way through after an apparently drunk reveller launches into a tirade.

Gasps and boos can be heard coming from the crowd, before the star continued with the show. In spite of the incident he took to his Twitter page to thank the crowd for a good evening.

He said: 'Durham you were a beautiful crowd and f***ing lively! See you in Newcastle on the 29th November!'

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the star told MailOnline: 'Green reacted when the student verbally
 abused him repeatedly and then went to strike him.

The prestigious university has schooled several well-known names, including TV and radio presenter Jeremy Vine and former Sunday Times editor Sir Harold Evans.

Botanist David Bellamy, broadcaster Kate Silverton, and musician Bryan Ferry are also among the famous alumni.

'The student was 
subsequently escorted out from the venue for being too drunk.'

Green has since tweeted: 'Since when is someone who hurls repeated abuse and tries to slap me a fan? As you were...'

It comes amid concerns about the culture of pressured binge drinking at British Universities, particularly during Freshers' week. 

Students were forced to kiss a dead conger eel and drink pints out of their shoe as part of a University of Exeter football club initiation.

Undercover footage has revealed the 'welcome drinks' breached the Athletic Union's code of conduct on multiple counts.

Around 80 freshers were pressured into 'bolting' full pints and divulging sexual secrets to a room of complete strangers at the Athletic Football Club event held at Cross Keys Bar.
