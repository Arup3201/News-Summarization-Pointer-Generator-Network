Arson: A Rhode Island grand jury indicted Corrine Latraverse (pictured) Wednesday on charges she purposely burned down her Woonsocket home

A Rhode Island mother of three allegedly burned down her house to spite her longtime boyfriend, one day after she caught him cheating.

Corrine Latraverse, 30 was indicted on charges of first-degree arson in Providence court on Wednesday for the incident which injured two firefighters and killed a cat.

A patrolling police officer was the first to report the fire that broke out in the Woonsocket house around 4pm on March 15.

Officer Scott Breguet found Latraverse with her three children - ages two, nine and 12 - safely outside the home with their two dogs.

Latraverse's hair was singed and she had burn marks on her jacket. The family was taken to Rhode Island Hospital and treated for smoke inhalation.

Though it was a multi-family building, no one else was inside at the time of the fire. 

Witnesses told Officer Breguet that 'they overheard other neighbors talking about how Corrine had told people on the way out of the house that she had burned the house down with a can of gas'

Another witness said the couple living in the apartment had been having 'domestic issues' and had bought the property to 'fix things' after they both cheated on each other.

Latraverse allegedly got into a fight with her boyfriend of 15 years the day before the fire when she caught him talking on the phone with another woman.

The two appeared to have reconciled though, when the unidentified boyfriend left for his job as a milk deliveryman the next day.

However, Latraverse called him in the middle of his shift and they got into a fight again, this time with Latraverse threatening to burn down the house.

Her boyfriend was still at work when she doused the hallways with gasoline and set the home on fire.

Strong winds spread the fire quickly and firefighters struggled to contain the blaze when they arrived at the scene.

Two firefighters received minor injuries when they fell through a floor inside the home engulfed in flames.

The house has since been razed. Latraverse remains in jail without bond and is set to be arraingned on July 23.
