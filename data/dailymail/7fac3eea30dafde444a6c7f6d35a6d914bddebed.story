The unseen damage that Top Gear UK's presenters inflicted on three cars, which are worth a combined $1 million, while rounding up cattle and racing in the outback has finally been revealed.

Pictures of the yellow Bentley Continental V8S, that was driven by Richard Hammond during the 22nd season episode, show the car covered in red dust with its front grill completely removed as it sits suspended in a mechanic workshop.

Hammond and his co-stars James May and Jeremy Clarkson had their pick of top vehicles to thrash around in a cattle station and an open mine in the Northern Territory during their visit to Australia in October last year.

Even though the underbodies of the three cars received extensive damage, car companies said the global exposure their brands expected to receive from being on the popular show would far outweigh any repair costs

Photos of the Bentley were sent to The Supercar Kids which reported that the vehicle lost at least 50 per cent of its original value due to the damage it received.

It is understood that the three cars were returned mechanically sound, but in dire need of cosmetic touch-ups including a complete re-spray.

The underbody of the cars were reported to have received a large amount of damage.

'The rectification work required was indeed cosmetic, to repair paint chips and scratches etc, which is unsurprising and acceptable after hundreds of miles on unsealed roads in the Northern Territory,' a spokesperson for Bentley UK told Fairfax.

The Bentley, worth over $AU400,000, had to have its front grill completely removed in the workshop after the outback filming session

Pictures of the Nissan GT-R and BMW M6 Gran Coupé that May and Clarkson drove are yet to emerge, however they are understood to have required similar touch-ups.  

The car companies are reported to have been entirely aware of the activities planned for the cars and the potential risk of damage.

A Nissan spokesman told Fairfax that the costs were worth the global exposure that the brands would receive by having their cars involved in the popular show. 

In a Q&A session with fans called An Evening With Top Gear, which was  broadcast on the show's YouTube channel,  Clarkson, May and Hammond spoke about their time in the country.

The trio revealed how they came face-to-face with all of the elements from snakes, to cows to the boiling hot weather. 

Big fans! Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, pictured here in the Northern Territory in October,  have said in a chat called An Evening With Top Gear that they loved filming some of the 22nd season in the Australian outback

Happy to slum it: The show's host had no qualms camping in the outback 

Full-throttle: Jeremy Clarkson said the Top Gear team had the time of their lives racing through Australia's Northern Territory for their latest series

But despite the gruelling environment, Clarkson said they had the time of their lives: 'We genuinely loved the Northern Territory,' the 54-year-old beamed.

'It was a brilliant trip. We loved the Northern Territory,' Hammond agreed.

Part of the tasks taken on by the car fanatics was rounding up some 4,000 cows on a 3.2million acre farm as the cameras rolled.

'When we're looking for 4,000 cows we could have been in the equivalent of Southampton. We could have been in Harwich, or Banbury or Dover [in the UK]. It's that big, that's how big the farm is,' May explained.

Doing his best Australian accent, he added: 'I said to the farmer: How are we going to find them? He said: 'Don't worry, I'll put them all in the paddock for you'. 

'I said that's very kind of you, how big is the paddock? He said: '39,000 acres.' That's a paddock?!'

'Australia needs a new unit of measurement because the acre is simply not big enough,' Clarkson mused.

The Top Gear hosts also spoke about their struggle with the time 11-hour time difference between England and Australia.

'I did enjoy it, yes. Apart from the time difference thing when they imagine it's eight o'clock in the morning, when we know [it's not], because we invented the time in Britain,' May joked.

No mean feat: 'When we're looking for 4,000 cows we could have been in the equivalent of Southampton. We could have been in Harwich, or Banbury or Dover [in the UK]. It's that big,' Jeremy explained

While the show has catapulted the hosts into a world of unimaginable wealth and success, the men were more than happy to rough it up, admitting they had no qualms swapping five-star accommodation for swags and tents.

'It wasn't luxurious but it wasn't terrible,' May said.
