A teenager thought to be the smallest in Britain has been hailed 'inspirational and beautiful' by TV viewers.

Georgia Rankin, 15, is just 2ft 8in - or 80 centimeters tall.

She was born with a rare form of 
skeletal dysplasia, known by many as dwarfism, which meant her bones 
fused together permanently when she was a toddler.

But despite having a condition which has mystified doctors worldwide, Georgia is determined to be like any other teenage girl -  going to her school prom and shopping with her friends - despite the fact she is in constant pain.

Even host Philip Scofield described Georgia as 'a delight to be around, with a sunny character'.

Courageous: Georgia's condition meant her bones fused together permanently when she was a toddler, leaving her in incredible pain

Hope: Georgia's parents had been told she would not survive beyond her early teens. But more than a decade of medical care later, doctors believe she can live a normal life

She told him and co-host Holly Willoughby: 'I've got amazing friends - they have all been fab.

'I've 
never had any bullying. I have had stares and some mean comments. They 
used to upset me, but now I'm not really bothered. I just carry on with 
what I'm doing.'

The schoolgirl, from Warrington, Cheshire, has found a beautiful jewel-studded dress made for a three-year-old for her prom.

But she added  the constant pain she is in means she sleeps poorly - meaning she can often be 'half asleep' at school.

Speaking about growing up with her condition, she said: 'The hardest thing growing up was not being able to do stuff for 
herself. 'I couldn't reach stuff, even get myself a glass of water.'

Skeletal dysplasia is an umbrella term for hundreds of similar conditions which restrict people's growth as they get older.

At first her parents Andrea and Simon were told she would not survive beyond her early teens.

But
 more than a decade of medical care later, Georgia is a happy, outgoing 
teenage girl who doctors believe can live a normal life.

Her parents Andrea, 36, and Simon, 38, feared something wasn't right when their daughter struggled to walk and was smaller than other toddlers.

They have taken her to countless specialists and sent her X-rays to doctors around the world but none have been able to identify exactly what Georgia's condition is.

Happy: Georgia, with parents Andrea and Simon, has already been outgrown by her four-year-old brother Brody but she refuses to be anything but upbeat

Host Philip Scofield described Georgia as 'a delight to be around, with a sunny character'

Her most recent operation in October took
 five hours and saw surgeons shave off the jagged tops of her thigh 
bones to make them more rounded and reduce the constant pain Georgia was
 in.

The teenager wrote on her blog: 'I was really sore afterwards I had to have an epidural inserted which had to stay in for 5 days.

'I was on morphine and ketamine but the pain in my left hip was unbearable, my right hip felt so much better, the pain was easing each day.

'I had to stay in hospital for two weeks before going home - I missed my dog Poppy so much. I had to do intense hydro and phsyio for the next 6 weeks, I was still unable to stand and the pain in my left hip was just as bad.

Chirpy: Georgia Rankin is like any other 15-year-old girl, apart from being 2ft 8in tall. Her friends in Warrington, Cheshire, call her Lil G and are helping her raise £18,000 for a specially-adapted wheelchair

Georgia, whose feet are a child's size seven, has already been outgrown by her four-year-old brother Brody but she refuses to be anything but upbeat.

Her parents are now helping their daughter raise £18,000 for a 'Snap Dragon' wheelchair which will be specially adapted to her small frame.

A previous campaign already touched the hearts of people in her home town - including Warrington Town FC's manager Shaun Reid - who helped the family raise £4,000 just before Christmas in just a few weeks.

The family want to use the money later this year to help Georgia achieve her dream of travelling to Florida and swimming with dolphins.

On their campaign website, they wrote: 'Georgia will always remain at 80cm in height - but we believe great things comes in small packages!

'​Our Lil G has to now try and live independently in a BIG world, where everything is a complete challenge. Despite all of this nothing stops her smiling!'

Georgia said: 'I just forget I am small. I see myself as the same as everyone else.' It is an upbeat assessment of what in many ways has been a difficult time, with countless appointments with specialists and hospital surgery

The wheelchair would help Georgia reach cupboards and shelves and be more independent, since at the moment she is unable to bear her own weight or even lift a kettle.

The campaign site said: 'It also goes to floor level from the comfort of her seat. Georgia can't weight bear whatsoever so can't stand up or get in or out of her wheelchair without help, if she drops anything she relies on the people around her to pick it up - she finds this extremely frustrating!

'Her current NHS wheelchair has been fantastic but it is just so big and does not have all the freedom options of a "Snappy". The cost for such a bespoke wheelchair is an overwhelming £18,000.'
