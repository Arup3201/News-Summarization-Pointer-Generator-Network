A new explosion in traffic fines may have started today after a council revealed it is the first to use automated CCTV to catch drivers making banned turns or illegally using yellow-box junctions.

Redbridge Council in east London insists its new system will tackle 'serious traffic contraventions' but critics say it is another way of 'harvesting' money from motorists.

Currently drivers breaking the rules must be seen on camera by an operator, either live or after watching back video, before issuing the £130 fine.

Now cameras at four junctions will automatically detect if there has been a banned turn or a yellow-box encroachment, and then use number plate recognition to identify the vehicle.

Fine regime: A London borough has become the first in Britain to use automatic CCTV to catch drivers who stop in box junctions like this one

Eye in the sky: Drivers who carry out illegal turns at junctions will also be snared automatically in a move that could kick-start an avalanche of new fines, experts fear

Its makers boast that the system will 'capture more offences' and 'deliver a higher return on investment'.

Redbridge
 council's environment, transportation and crime committee head, Shoaib 
Patel, said: 'The system was installed to counter the high number of 
drivers that were ignoring the traffic restrictions that were in place, 
causing severe safety hazards to pedestrians and other drivers. 

'The
 system is working well and we have captured a number of vehicles 
committing serious traffic contraventions, which is promising.'

The company behind the system, Videalert, uses advanced camera technology known as ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) to capture drivers breaching traffic laws.

Videalert says its technology can read numberplates that were blind to old ANPR systems - for example, if they were dirty or had been sprayed with non-reflective paint.

The system has been installed using a ‘capital expenditure neutral’ model, which sees all costs recovered through the issuing of penalty charge notices (PCNs).

It automates the detection and capture of  moving traffic offences, and comes up with 'validation processing' of the evidence data.

This is then automatically posted to the back office system that issues the PCNs.

The firm claims a study showed its 
scheme detected 2 per cent more vehicles over a 90-minute period, 
compared to a normal ANPR system without its new camera technology.

It promises that the system ‘will 
deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing 
road safety wherever it is deployed'.

Motoring groups have worries about the new system, especially because councils may decide to fit the systems on junctions likely to produce more fines.

AA
 president Edmund King said: 'We are concerned that this automated 
system is more about harvesting motorists for money and profit than 
deterring bad driver behaviour.

'There
 needs to be the safeguard that, if this system starts fining drivers on
 an industrial scale, an analysis of the problem junctions takes place. 
The ticket haul may be partly down to the road layout.

'There
 is also the added concern that, if signing is inadequate, local drivers
 may learn to be wary but outsiders may be caught time after time for 
mistakes, minor infringements or circumstances outside their control, 
such as making way for emergency vehicles.'

RAC
 head of external affairs Pete Williams said: 'It is very worrying to 
hear mention of a phrase like 'will deliver a higher return on 
investment' in association with a new type of moving traffic offence 
enforcement camera as it automatically makes you think the council is 
investing to make money rather than to change driver behaviour.

'Common
 sense needs to be applied with a new system like this to avoid creating
 a situation similar to Clapham's 'money box junction' (in south London)
 where a camera has been positioned in a place where there are clearly 
issues with the design and layout of the road which leads to motorists 
repeatedly being caught out.

Expansion: Britain's camera network already uses similar technology for speed offences but now it has been extended to several junctions

'If
 drivers are blatantly ignoring signage, then something needs to be 
done, but fairness should be key in the use of cameras like these.

'It
 is encouraging, however, to hear that footage will be reviewed before 
penalty charge notices are issued as this will hopefully prevent some 
accidental driver errors being unfairly penalised.'

In use at four locations, the system has been designed by the Videalert company and can also catch drivers ignoring restricted access signs.

According to the company, its system combines video analytics and ANPR (automatic number plate recognition) detection to 'capture more offences than can be achieved by traditional legacy solutions and will deliver a higher return on investment and compliance whilst increasing road safety wherever it is deployed'.
