Blackmail threats allegedly made against Bernie Ecclestone ‘sounded like they had come straight from a gangster film’, a court heard.

Investigators said the F1 boss failed to give ‘concrete details’ to back his claim he was blackmailed by Gerhard Gribkowsky, who was in charge of selling Bayern LB bank’s stake in F1 in 2005.

Ecclestone, 83, says Gribkowsky demanded £27million to buy his silence over ‘untrue allegations’ about his financial affairs.

But prosecutors say it was a bribe to get Gribkowsky – currently in jail for taking the money – to sell to a certain equity firm.

Flanked
 by his imposing legal team, Ecclestone looked calm and collected as he 
appeared at a Munich court on the second day of his trial on bribery 
charges.

Mr
 Ecclestone's had gathered together a crack team of lawyers to represent
 him in the case, not least Dr Sven Thomas, thought of as one of 
Germany's top legal minds.

The
 hulking lawyer, who towers over Mr Ecclestone's 5' 2" frame, is an 
expert in white collar crime cases having represented huge companies and
 several high profile German politicians during his 36 year career.

He was in 
Mr Ecclestone's corner today as two German investigators gave evidence 
in a case where, if convicted, the Formula One chief, who has built up 
his power base in Formula One since the 1970s would likely find his 
position in the sport's hierarchy untenable.

The
 charges involve a $44million (£26 million) payment to banker Gerhard 
Gribkowsky, who is serving an eight-and-a-half-year sentence for taking 
the money.

Based on information from a two-year investigation, prosecutors allege the payment was meant to facilitate the sale of Munich-based bank Bayern LB's stake in Formula One to a buyer of Ecclestone's liking. Gribkowsky was in charge of selling that 47 percent stake in F1 in 2005.

While Ecclestone claims he was the victim of blackmail, in court today, German prosecutors did their best to cast doubt on that assertion.

Called as a witness, Martin Bauer, a public prosecutor who took evidence from Ecclestone after the arrest of Gribkowsky in 2011, said: 'It was never really clear what form this threat could have taken'.

Bauer said Ecclestone had spoken merely of Gribkowsky being able to make things uncomfortable for him without specifying how. Ecclestone, who denied wrongdoing when he went on trial last week, followed the proceedings through an interpreter.

The former used-car salesman, who is fighting to save his job and his reputation, is required to attend every session in a case that will be heard once or twice a week to fit around his Formula One commitments and is set to run until mid-September.

CVC, the largest shareholder in Formula One, has said it will dismiss Ecclestone if he is found guilty.

Dr Sven Thomas, the silver-haired lawyer hulking over Bernie Ecclestone's 5' 2" frame, is one of the most respected legal minds in Germany and part of the team spearheading the Formula One boss's defence against bribery charges.

Qualifying as a lawyer 36 years ago, Dr Thomas has made a career as an expert in white collar crime cases, defending both people and companies of note in a number of high profile cases.

The Chambers Directory describes Dr Thomas as ‘fantastic’ and he has been referred to by peers as ‘one of the standout defence lawyers in Germany'.

His highest profile case to date has been as part of the defence team for several directors of German company Mannesmann, who were charged with various counts on misconduct in relation to the company's takeover by Vodafone in 2000.

Although all the defendants were acquitted, an appeal led to a retrial of all the men but the charges were again shelved on the understanding that the defendants would make public and charitable payments according to their means.

Ecclestone testified during Gribkowsky's trial in 2011 and the banker is seen as the key witnesses for the prosecution in this trial, which is scheduled to last until September 16.

Gribkowsky was found guilty of corruption, tax evasion and breach of trust in a trial heard by the same judge who is overseeing Ecclestone's case, Peter Noll.

The defense made clear that it will attack Gribkowsky's credibility, and when the trial opened last week, Ecclestone protested his innocence in a statement read by his lawyers.

In the statement, Ecclestone reiterated testimony he gave at Gribkowsky's 2012 trial that he gave the banker the money because he was 'blackmailed' and worried Gribkowsky would falsely accuse of him of being in charge of a trust fund set up for the his former wife and their children — possibly incurring a huge British tax bill.

Ecclestone said that 'from today's point of view, it was not a rational decision' to pay Gribkowsky.

'I saw my life's work in danger' if Gribkowsky went to the British tax authorities, he said, adding that he wouldn't have been able to pay the resulting bill.

Ecclestone said he had turned over his entire stake in Formula One to his then-wife, Slavica, and their two daughters, in 1997, following a series of health scares that left him worried his family would have to pay a 40 per cent inheritance tax on his fortune if he died.

He claims that while he runs the day-to-day business of Formula One, he has not persoanlly owned a stake since 1997.

Ecclestone has stepped down temporarily 
as a director of Formula One's holding company pending the outcome of 
the trial, though he continues to manage the sport's commercial 
operations on behalf of investment fund CVC Capital Partners, which has a
 controlling stake in the web of companies which run the commercial side
 of the sport.

Ecclestone's lawyers also insisted anew that their client is innocent, saying in a written statement that 'the alleged bribe has not occurred.'

They argued that the charge is based on statements by Gribkowsky that are 'incorrect, misleading and incoherent' and said they would produce new documents at the trial to dispute Gribkowsky's assertions.

Ecclestone faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.
