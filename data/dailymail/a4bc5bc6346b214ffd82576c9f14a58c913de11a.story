MI5 and Scotland Yard were close to arresting hate preacher Abu Hamza four years before the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001, court papers reveal.

The documents represent a blow to Hamza’s claims in a New York Court that he had been working with the security services while he was at Finsbury Park Mosque in north London as a force for good.

Hamza was eventually jailed in 2005 for inciting murder and racial hatred.

Hamza claimed that he was a force for good in his ramblings and worked with the police and security services. MI5 has announced it was close to arresting him in 1997

The 56-year-old was extradited to the US nearly two years ago on terror charges.

Recording a meeting with Hamza in October 1997, an MI5 officer wrote: ‘I reasserted the view that over the past few months in particular, he had walked a dangerous tightrope and had come close to being culpable for incitement to violence .  .  . the Security Service, in particular, took a dim view of those advocating violence, even if the violence was perpetrated overseas.’

MI5 claims that it was planning to arrest Abu Hamza four years before the terrorist attack on New York on September 11, 2001

MI5 agent Reda Hassaine, who infiltrated the mosque, said: ‘Hamza was able to recruit and brainwash vulnerable young men and raise huge amounts of cash for his contacts overseas.

‘The security services seemed incapable of putting it in its proper al-Qaeda context.

'They continued to view it as a little local skirmish by a clown.’
