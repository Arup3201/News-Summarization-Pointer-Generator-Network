A prized possession of one music's biggest petrolheads, Elvis Presley, is set to fetch up to $300,000 at auction next month.

Elvis bought the Rolls-Royce Phantom V brand new in 1963 and had it custom-fitted with the latest gadgets including a telephone, electric windows and a microphone. 

The car was initially midnight blue, but he was forced to have it re-painted a lighter silver because his mother's chickens would repeatedly peck at their reflections when he visited her.

Elvis was renowned for his love of cars, especially Rolls Royces. He is pictured here with another Phantom he bought in 1961 outside his Graceland mansion 

When his new purchase arrived, he sent it to Britain where coachbuilder James Young installed the newest gadgets including a Blaupunkt Koln radio, parking and flashing lights and air conditioning.

The car will go under the hammer next month at a Bonhams sale in The Quail, California and is expected to sell for between $200,000 and $300,000.

The centre rear armrest featured a writing pad, mirror and clothes brush while a fitted cabinet contained cut glass decanters and crystal glasses.

Under the bonnet was a 6.2-litre, V8 engine which gave the 2.6-ton car 200bhp and a top speed 

of around 100mph.

Elvis, then a 28-year-old global sensation, had the 20-foot long car shipped out to his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, where he entertained the likes of The Beatles.

Memphis's most famous son held on to the Rolls-Royce for five years before donating it to charity, where it sold for $35,000 (£20,500).

It then disappeared for the next 20 years until it was bought by its current owner at a memorabilia auction in London.

They have kept it in a private museum and used it sparingly, with the car regularly maintained by English Rolls-Royce restorers Frank Dale and Stepsons.

Bonhams yesterday described the Rolls-Royce as 'one of the more significant Phantom V's to have come up for sale in recent years'.

The auction house added: 'It is a most interesting model of this highly desirable motorcar complete with undisputed Elvis provenance

'It is offered with copy of its original chassis card confirming the original owner as well as his exacting specifications.

'This important and significant Rolls-Royce Phantom V, with its undisputed place in pop culture history, will surely be jewel in the crown for any Elvis collector.'

Steering wheel: After the car was given a makeover, with new seating and radio put in place, it was shipped to his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles 

Grey interior: Memphis's most famous son held on to the Rolls-Royce for five years before donating it to charity, where it sold for $35,000.

Innovative: Elvis had the car fitted with all the latest gadgets of the time including a telephone, electric windows and air conditioning 

Proof: The car comes with its original documents. The form states that the owner is 'Elvis Presley' and the coach builder who designed the interior is Briton, James Young
