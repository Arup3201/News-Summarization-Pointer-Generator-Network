Thief: Carol Payne, 31, stole £11,500 from the private school's minibus fund and has now told police she took cash from a church

A mother who stole £11,500 from a private school's minibus fund to pay her child's tuition fees has also admitted to taking cash from a local church, a court heard today.

Carol Payne used her role as treasurer of the parent-teacher association at Highclare School in Birmingham to plunder cash from the group's bank account.

The 31-year-old - who was chosen for the PTA role because she has a background in accountancy - then used the money to pay for her child's fees at the school.

Payne admitted stealing £11,532 from the private school when she appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Court in February this year.

But her sentencing was adjourned at Birmingham Crown Court today after it emerged she had been arrested on suspicion of stealing from a church in Saltley in the city.

Defending Payne, Liz De'Oliveira, said the mother had given a 'full and frank admission' to police on March 4 but had not yet been charged with the offence.

The court heard the treasurer had stolen around £13,000 from the church and was due to speak to officers again next month.

Miss De'Oliveira said: 'She is facing similar matters which are under investigation regarding Saltley Church.

'She has already been interviewed on the 4th of this month and has made full and frank admissions.

'My understanding is it's around £13,000. In my respectful submissions it would be sensible to have all matters before the court together.

'She has managed to get some compensation together. Members of her family have very kindly clubbed together to get some £9,000 in compensation'.

Deception: Payne used her role as treasurer of Highclare Schoolís parent teacher association to plunder the group's bank account

Revelations: It also emerged in court today that she has admitted taking £13,000 from this church in Saltley, Birmingham

Recorder Patrick Upward QC adjourned the case and bailed Payne, ordering her to return to court for sentencing for both matters on April 24.

He told her: 'This is a very serious matter for which a term of imprisonment is likely.'

At an earlier hearing at Birmingham Magistrates Court, Payne pleaded guilty to stealing £11,532 from Highclare School's PTA between September 19, 2012 and October 13, 2012.
