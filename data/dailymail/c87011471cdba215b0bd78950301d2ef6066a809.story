The case against three football fans who allegedly used the word ‘Yid’ has been dropped.

Gary Whybrow, 31, Sam Parsons, 24, and Peter Ditchman, 52, were accused of public order offences at Tottenham Hotspur matches last autumn.

But the Crown Prosecution Service announced yesterday that the case would be discontinued as there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of convictions.

Controversial: Spurs fans began using the word themselves after years of abuse at White Hart Lane (pictured)

Baljit Ubhey from the CPS said: ‘Although the same words used in other contexts could in theory satisfy the criteria for “threatening, abusive or insulting”, it is unlikely a court would find that they were in the context of the three cases in question.’

Mr Whybrow, from west London, and Mr Parsons, from Amersham, Buckinghamshire, were charged with a public order offence following a match in November.

Mr Ditchman, from Bishop’s Stortford, Herts, was accused over a match in October.

For years Tottenham Hotspur, who have a strong Jewish following, have received anti-semitic abuse from opposition supporters.

In an act of defiance, some fans started using the word ‘Yid’ themselves and it often features in chants at their White Hart Lane ground in north London.

But police had warned supporters they would take action.

The CPS decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute the trio. Pictured: Spurs fans in 2011
