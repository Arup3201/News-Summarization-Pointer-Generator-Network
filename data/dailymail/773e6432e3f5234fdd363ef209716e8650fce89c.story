Symone Greene, a 22-year-old substitute teacher, has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse of a minor in a significant relationship after allegedly having sex with a football player student. 

A 17-year-old teenager is said to have recorded the teacher performing a sexual act before sending the video to his friends.  

The alleged incident happened on October 17 in a classroom at Options Public Charter School in Washington, DC, according to the warrant.

The teen, a football player, recorded Greene performing a sex act on him after a high school pep rally for the team, authorities say 

The student told police he met her at the school and gave her his phone number, reports WTTG. 

He claims he later received a text message from Greene, who was teaching English, to which he asked her if she was 'kinky'.

She allegedly responded, 'I don't tell, I show,' court documents state.

The sex attack at the end of the school's pep rally - it allegedly occurred in Greene's classroom where the student recorded the oral sex,  without Greene's knowledge, according to the warrant. 

Greene then allegedly sent the teen a text message over the weekend asking him not to tell anyone because 'it is not right for a student and teacher to have a relationship.'

Greene was working at Options Public Charter School (pictured) in Northeast D.C. on Friday when she first met the victim, a 17-year-old football player, according to court documents

She also allegedly sent a clothed picture of herself to the student, reports WUSA.

'When school administrators learned of the incident Monday morning, we immediately contacted the Child and Family Services Agency, the Metropolitan Police Department, and the parent of the student,' Shannon Hodge, the school's executive director, said in a statement. 

Hodge said Greene was contracted through a company based in Delaware and had never worked at the school before.

Greene was arrested and charged this week, according to the documents.
