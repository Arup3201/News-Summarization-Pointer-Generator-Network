Paul Gascoigne's family are rallying round the struggling star after he was spared jail for assaulting a rail guard.

The former England international was pictured looking relaxed as he strolled through London's Covent Garden with his ex-wife Sheryl and 17-year-old son Regan.

On Monday, Gascoigne, 46, was handed a £1,245 fine after the drunken row at Stevenage train station in Hertfordshire on July 4.

Support: Gascoigne's wife Sheryl, right, was called to the incident at Stevenage train station to try and calm him down but the star was eventually arrested by police

But days before the court case the family were seen shopping together in the capital. Dressed in a white shirt and jeans, Gascoigne looked thin but otherwise in good health.

Earlier this week magistrates heard how the ex-Rangers 
and Spurs star grabbed guard Jack Sherrington, 23, around the throat and
called him a 'c***'.

Staff managed to contact his former wife Sheryl who arrived at the scene but Gascoigne was arrested.

Gascoigne was charged with assault and being drunk and disorderly but a third charge of assault against Sheryl was dropped.

The pair split in 1998 after a 
tumultuous two-year marriage but Sheryl has recently been helping 
Gascoigne battle his long-term addiction to alcohol.

His family had hoped he was on the mend after he was discharged from a rehab clinic in the US in March.

But last month he was found drunk on a Newcastle to London train.

Magistrates
heard how he had been visiting his ill father, when a ticket inspector 
on the train from Newcastle to London found him drunk.

Gascoigne
got off at Stevenage, where station guard Jack Sherrington tried to 
help him into a wheelchair as he was struggling to walk.

Elaine
McMillan, prosecuting, said: ‘The defendant was abusive towards Mr 
Sherrington, using the c-word repeatedly and he ended up grabbing hold 
of Mr Sherrington effectively in the neck area.’

Gascoigne’s
ex-wife Sheryl, his stepdaughter Bianca and son Regan were called to 
the station, where he was arrested for drunk and disorderly and assault 
at around 10.30pm.

Miss McMillan said that Regan, 17, who works as a model, became upset as he watched his father get arrested.

After sentencing: Gascoigne started drinking again because he was worried about his sick father, who is seriously ill with a heart condition, the court was told

Arrived: Gascoigne was in such a state after falling off the wagon again that station staff were forced to call his ex-wife Sheryl (pictured), 47, to try and calm him down, Stevenage Magistrates' Court heard

Gavin Harris, defending, said that 
Gascoigne had been drinking due to stress caused by worry for his father
and ‘acute physical pain’ resulting from a recent hip operation.

He said he had not actually had much 
to drink, but the effect was worse as he had not drunk in a long time. 
‘Mr Gascoigne is remorseful and apologises for his actions,’ he added.

Magistrate Carolyn Marsh said that it
was a ‘serious matter’, and fined Gascoigne a total of £1,245 including
£100 in compensation to Mr Sherrington, who said: ‘I sincerely hope he 
gets the help that he needs in the future.’

The court also heard that Gascoigne was receiving 'one to one' treatment for his alcoholism, which was continuing. After sentencing, Gascoigne left the court and was driven away in a grey Porsche.

In a statement released through British Transport Police, Mr Sherrington, from Peterborough, said: 'I am grateful for and welcome Mr Gascoigne's decision to plead guilty today.

'I am told that since the incident he has offered his apologies for his behaviour, and I fully accept them.

'In differing ways this has not been easy for either of us and I sincerely hope he gets the help that he needs in the future.

'With the conclusion of the case, and
Mr Gascoigne's sentencing, I now consider this matter closed. I will 
not be conducting any interviews at this time and ask for my privacy in 
this regard to be respected.'

Mr Harris said outside court: 'Mr 
Gascoigne has asked me to say a few words on his behalf. He wants to 
publicly apologise for his actions that evening. He now wishes to be 
left alone to carry on with his recovery.'

The footballer also played for 
Rangers, Lazio, Middlesborough and Everton. He was capped 57 times by 
England and scored 10 goals.

In April, Gascoigne thanked the 
Premier League stars and celebrity friends who saved his life after 
funding his latest stint in rehab at the Cottonwood clinic in Arizona.

Speaking on Alan Carr's chat show 
Chatty Man, he thanked Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans, and footballers Wayne 
Rooney and Steven Gerrard - among others - for stepping in to pay the 
£7,500 a week cost.

They had clubbed together to help 
fund his treatment after he suffered a public meltdown at a charity 
event in Northampton in January.

Widely regarded as one of the most gifted English footballers of his generation, Paul Gascoigne has long fought an all-consuming battle with alcoholism.

Known for his genius on the pitch, his chaotic life has been dogged by a constant tendency to self destruct.

While he enjoyed many highs on the pitch, there have also been many lows, including struggling with mental illness, bulimia, panic attacks, addictions and domestic violence.

This came to a head when earlier this year he was placed in intensive care in a hospital in the US while he was being treated for alcoholism during a rehabilitation programme.

At the time he was said to be close to death and it was reported that he was revived a number of times.

At first, his antics in bars and clubs across Europe had looked like the result of the overblown enthusiasm and thirst for the high life which rapidly became his off-the-pitch trademark.

But the excesses that have marred his life for so long eventually led to his exclusion from the England World Cup squad in 1998.

Other high profile alcoholism incidents included being sacked from managing Kettering Town FC in 2005 after he was accused of being drunk at games and appearing at the scene of the stand-off between the police and gunman Raoul Moat in 2010.

Arriving at the scene in Rothbury, Northumberland, Gazza claimed he was a friend of Moat and said he had brought him 'a can of lager, some chicken, fishing rod, a Newcastle shirt and a dressing gown'.

He was also sectioned under the Mental Health Act twice in the space of six months in 2008 and admitted in his autobiography to headbutting his wife Sheryl and throwing her to the floor.

First thrust into the national consciousness after a number of brilliant performances at the 1990 World Cup in Italy, he quickly became a household name.

From there he would play for such teams as Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur, Lazio, and Rangers and became loved by fans as a talented joker.

Born in Gateshead, Tyne & Wear, on May 27 1967, he also starred in midfield for Terry Venables' England side during Euro 96, the highlight being his magical goal against Scotland.

He is also remembered for crying after being booked in the semi-final of the 1990 World Cup against West Germany, as he knew the booking meant he would be suspended for the final if England got there.
