With dishes piled in the sink and counter-tops stacked with rubbish, it's going to take more than the smell of freshly baked bread and a neutral colour scheme to shift this property.

From the outside the three-bedroom semi-detached property in Short Heath Road, Erdington, Birmingham, appears respectable.

But pictures of the interior of the house show unmade beds, a rubbish-strewn living room, piles of washing up in the sink and a filthy bathroom.

The spacious kitchen comes complete with dirty dishes and a rubbish-strewn floor

The generous lounge features camping chairs and stepladder among the debris, which the owners didn't appear to think would bother buyers

The agent describes the third bedroom as being 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom'

A traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation.

To
 the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back 
into two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility
 room towards the rear.

To
 the first floor is a family bathroom and three bedrooms two of them are
 doubles and the third is bigger than your normal sized third bedroom.

There is also a front and rear garden, the property is available with no chain.

The property is on the market for £114,950 and has been listed on Zoopla.co.uk by Burchell Edwards estate agents who are marketing it as 'ideal for any private or investment purchaser'.

The agent describes the property as a 'period style' house featuring 'Minton tiled flooring' in the vestibule and a 'generous lounge.'

The property has a 'family bathroom' and a
 third bedroom which is 'bigger than your normal sized third bedroom' as
 well as being just half-a-mile from Erdington Train Station and local 
shops, the website says.

The kitchen diner is said to feature 'a 
range of wall and base units incorporating a one-and-a-half bowl 
stainless steel sink with drainer, integrated appliances to include 
oven, hob and microwave.'

Despite its cluttered interior, the agent has said the filth has not put buyers

The wipes, rubber gloves and cleaning spray in the property's family bathroom don't seem to have had much use

The exterior of the house is relatively respectable - although the lawn could do with a trim

The house is listed on property site Zoopla.co.uk, where it is described as a 'traditional period style property'

The listing states: 'A traditional period style property set back off the road in need of modernisation available with no chain.

'To the ground floor is a generous through lounge that could be split back in to two receptions if required and access to the kitchen with a utility room towards the rear.'

A spokesman for Burchell Edwards said: 'We have had a lot of interest from potential buyers regarding the house on Short Heath Road.

'The pictures taken might make the house look messy but looking beyond that, it is obvious that the property has a lot of potential.'

How a house should look when going up for sale

Sellers should make their property as neutral as possible by using a light colour scheme and keeping rooms clutter free.

This will help potential buyers feel at home and able to imagine how they can put their stamp on it.

Natural light is important, so all curtains should be fully opened and dingy nets taken down.

In the summer months a sense of space can be created by opening windows.

Small
 touches like a vase of flowers will help brighten up a room while 
certain smells, such as freshly baked bread can add a positive setting.

However, strong incense and perfumed candles should be avoided as they can be overpowering and unfamiliar.

Tired
 kitchens and bathrooms will put potential buyers off and these should 
be clean and fresh - replace cupboard doors for a budget make over.

It
 is important not to neglect the exterior of the house, and freshly 
painted woodwork and a neat garden will reassure viewers that the 
property has been well maintained.
