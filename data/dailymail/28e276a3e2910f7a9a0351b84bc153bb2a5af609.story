A PE teacher who saved a pupilâ€™s life during a job interview was left disappointed when she was still turned down for the job.

Emma Denham, aged in her twenties, was taking a class at Mountbatten School in Hampshire as part of the interview when a 16-year-old boy collapsed from a heart attack.

She gave him CPR and was one of four staff who restarted his heart with a defibrillator.

'Miracle': Sam Mangoro, 16, was saved by Emma Denham's swift action during her job interview at his school

Despite paramedics confirming that it was the fast action of teachers that saved the pupil, the school has declined to say why Miss Denham was not offered the job.

They had to shock him four times before his heart restarted, as his friends waited anxiously nearby.

The schoolboy was rushed to Southampton General Hospital by ambulance, where he was placed in an induced coma.

Doctors praised the teachers for their courage and ability to remain calm under pressure, saying it was their quick-thinking that saved his life.

Sam is today being slowly woken from a medically induced coma, which he has been in since the incident on Thursday afternoon.

His dad Michael, from Romsey, said: 'We would like to thank every single member of staff from the school from the bottom of our hearts.

'They have given us our son back, because without them we wouldn't have him. We are quietly optimistic.

Sam's parents, Michael and Wendy, praised Miss Denham for saving their son's life

'The critical thing was the treatment he received at the school from the teachers.

'It was absolutely incredible and that's given him every fighting chance.'

He added: 'They did an absolutely 
amazing and wonderful thing under immense pressure - and I in what must 
have been a lot of fear.'

Miss
 Denham was being observed by teacher Jon Neale and deputy head Joanna 
Scott as she took the class as part of a job interview.

The children had only just warmed up and were a few minutes into the lesson when Sam stopped breathing and collapsed.

Mrs Scott said: 'Everything seemed to be in slow motion but we did everything we possibly could.'The other children were amazing and were so sensible, all leaving the gym so we could work on Sam.

'We are all still very emotional about it, but at the time you don't think - autopilot sets in and you get on with what you need to do.

'It is overwhelming to think about what we did. Every single school needs a defibrillator.'

Sam's parents, Michael and Lynda, who have three younger sons, have been holding a bedside vigil.

But they took a short break to visit the school on Friday to thank all of the staff who kept their son alive.

Mr Mangoro added: 'We wanted to show them our gratitude.

'We will never be able to repay them for what they have done, they have been amazing because they are not medical professionals, yet they did this. We are thankful that luck was on his side on that day.

'Had he being walking home from school alone, or if the school hadn't had a defibrillator it could have been a lot different.'

Sam, a bright pupil who is studying for his GCSEs, was left fighting for life aged ten when a virus damaged his heart.

It left him needing medication for the rest of his life, and his parents were warned he would need a heart transplant by the time he was ten.

But Sam proved them wrong and this is the first time his condition has caused him to suffer a cardiac arrest.

Councillor Peter Edgar, head of education at Hampshire County Council, said: 'I wish Sam a safe and successful recovery.

'The school should be congratulated for the action they took during what must have been very traumatic circumstances.'
