An animal lover tried to help a seagull chick - but was attacked by its mother leaving her with a bloody head wound.

Student Shannon Harris, 18, was dive-bombed after she went to help the young bird which had wandered onto a busy road.

The adult gull swooped on Ms Harris and pecked the art student with its powerful beak in a scene straight out of Alfred Hitchcock's horror movie The Birds.

Brutal: Animal lover Shannon Harris was pecked on the head by seagulls after she tried to help a chick that had wandered into the road in Aberystwyth, Wales

Locals say it is the latest in a series of seagull attacks in the seaside town of Aberystwyth, Wales.

She said: 'The baby gull was in the road and a car was approaching so I tried to shoo it out of the way.

'But it started screeching and the next thing I knew I was being dive-bombed by three or four adult birds.

'One of them swooped down and pecked me on the head, while another got tangled in my hair.'

Bloody: When Ms Harris was safely inside her house she realised the seagulls had drawn blood

Terrified: Ms Harris said she was shaken by the attack and would think twice before going near a bird in the future

Ms Harris, who is from Birmingham but is studying at Aberystwyth University, ran home with the ferocious gulls in pursuit.

She said: 'They were swooping down on me and clipping their beaks.

'I was terrified - my hands were shaking so much I couldn’t unlock my front door.'

When Ms Harris was safely inside her house she realised the extent of her injuries.

She said: 'I didn’t realise at first that my head was bleeding - it was just pounding.

'But when I went up into my room and looked in the mirror I could see blood mangled in my hair.

'It is a nasty puncture wound but it was more the terror of being attacked by such a big bird that upset me.

'I should have gone to hospital but I have treated the wound with some antiseptic cream.

'I love animals and wildlife but it will teach me to keep away in future.'
