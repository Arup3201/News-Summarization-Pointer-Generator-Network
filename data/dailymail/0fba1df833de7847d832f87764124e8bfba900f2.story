Footage of a 13-year-old dancing to Madonna's Vogue during his Bar Mitzvah party in 1992 became an internet sensation with more than a million hits after it was posted on YouTube earlier this year.

But far from being embarrassed about his internet fame, Shaun Sperling appears to have spent time perfecting the dance routine and has recreated the viral 'Vogue' video to show off his latest moves.

The original footage was taken from Sperling's coming of age Bar Mitzvah party in a northwest suburb of Chicago on March 14, 1992.

Then and now: A 13-year-old Shaun Sperling dancing to Vogue in 1992, left, and twenty years later he appears to have perfected the dance, right

Surprise: After he whipped of his suit jacket, Sperling revealed Madonna's face was printed on the back of his shirt

Step-for-step: Sperling even had a T-Shirt with a portrait of Madonna on the back for the remake - but it's not clear if it was the same shirt

Sperling has now recreated the video 
step-for-step at a gay cabaret club for charity - with every small 
detail identical to the original (with one tiny addition of half-naked 
backing dancers).

At the start of both videos, Sperling takes to the dance floor wearing a smart suit jacket.

But he soon whips it off to reveal Madonna's face printed on the back of his white shirt.

As he begins his dance, the spectators start whooping and clapping with encouragement - in both the 1992 and recent versions.

Icon: Vogue had been released by Madonna two years before Sperling performed his version of her dance 'Vogue' at his Bar Mitzvah

Still a fan: Sperling has perfected his moves but now has the help of some shiny backing dancers

Not that Sperling needs any 
reassurance - in the five minute clip he confidently rolls out all the 
moves from her monochrome video.

But in the slightly raunchier recnt 
video, Sperling continues to strip down to a black vest top, much to the
audience's delight.

Madonna had released the chart-topping song in 1990 and clearly Shaun used the time since to learn her famous moves.

At one point in the original video he even gets on the floor, resting on one hand while he throws his head back.

But he has one advantage in his remake of the clip - two glittery dancers to help support some of his moves.

At the end of the original 
performance Shaun walked over to the edge of the dance floor and 
retrieves his jacket - but not before he got a kiss from a proud lady in
peach.

Showcasing his skill: The video has already been viewed by over 40,000 people since it was posted online earlier this week

Go with the flow: Whatever his age, spectators appear to love Shaun Sperling imitating Madonna

Floor work: Throughout the duration of the song whoops of encouragement can be heard from the spectators

Let your body go: Sperling has added a few extra moves - and people - to the routine

The theme of the Bar Mitzvah was 
evident to the guests from the start - the final shot shows a giant 
Madonna poster above the DJ stand.

And it seems his passion hasn't faded overtime as he now regularly reperforms his Vogue routine for cheering spectators.

The original has now been viewed more
than a million times but his latest version is quickly catching up - 
and already has more than 15,000 hits in less than a day.

Finished: At the end of the performance Shaun walked over to the edge of the dancefloor and retrieved his jacket - but decided to remain in his tight black vest top in the newer version

Superfan: The theme of the Bar Mitzvah should have been obvious as this poster was on the wall above the DJ
