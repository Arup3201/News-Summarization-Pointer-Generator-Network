An air and sea search is under way after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry between Orkney and Shetland.

The alarm was raised at around 4am today to the man, who had boarded in Aberdeen but had gone missing from the NorthLink ferry MV Hrossey. He was last seen on the boat at 3.30am.

Coastguard helicopters are currently involved in the search of rough seas south west of Fair Isle and three lifeboat crews are currently at the scene. Officials confirmed that it looks very likely that the missing man, who is thought to be in his 40s has gone overboard.

A spokeswoman for Shetland Coastguard said: 'The Serco NorthLink ferry Hrossey has reported a person overboard to the south west of Fair Isle.

'There is a search ongoing at the moment with the coastguard helicopter Rescue 102.

'Lerwick, Kirkwall and Stromness lifeboats are proceeding to the scene.'

With more than 170 passengers on board, the ferry was sailing from Orkney to Shetland when the man is thought to have gone overboard.

The ferry turned around and crew searched for five hours, before continuing north, as lifeboat crews arrived at the scene.
