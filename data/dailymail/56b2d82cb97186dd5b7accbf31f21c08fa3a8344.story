The mother of a man who died in an icy South Dakota river while trying to rescue a 6-year-old boy says her son made the ultimate sacrifice.

A search boat on Saturday discovered the body of 28-year-old Lyle Francis Eagletail in the Big Sioux River.

Mr Eagletail and 16-yer-old Madison Leigh Wallace died when they tried to save Madison's brother, Garrett Martin Wallace, who later emerged from the river uninjured.

Tragic hunt: On Thursday evening rescue workers searched through 6-10 feet of foam covering the icy Big Sioux River while searching for the pair who fell in after the boy

First responders: Lyle Eagletail, 28, has been 
identified as the man who lunged into the icy Sioux River to help 
16-year-old Madison Wallace rescue her 6-year-old brother, right, before
both were swept by the current

Mr Eagletail's mother, Margaret, was among about two dozen family members and friends who watched the recovery effort Saturday at Falls Park.

‘I think of my son as the biggest hero. He sacrificed himself for that little child and that's the way his grandmother brought him up, with much love and respect,’ Margaret Eagletail told KSFY-TV.

The incident happened Thursday afternoon.

Witness accounts differ on whether someone pushed the boy out of the water or he popped up on a rock before being pulled ashore, Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras has said.

The body of Madison Wallace, of Vermillion, was discovered Friday afternoon. Mr Eagletail's body was discovered about 100 feet from her body in a part of the river that was about 12 feet deep, police said.

Margaret Eagletail thanked the rescue workers after her son's body was recovered.

Victim: Madison Wallace's body was discovered Friday afternoon, a day after she jumped in the water to save her brother

Jeff Helm, division chief for Sioux Falls Fire and Rescue, said the recovery of the body provided some closure for family members and searchers. Helm said he "can only imagine" what the family members of the two victims are going through.

‘We are trying to keep them informed what the next steps are,’ Helm said.

Emergency crews found the dead body of the 16-year-old girl who jumped into a fast and icy river to save her 6-year-old brother.

Madison Leigh Wallace jumped into the Big Sioux River in North Dakota's Falls Park after her young brother fell in the river.

Though they the incident started at 
around 6pm on Thursday, officials only found Madison's body was found on
Friday afternoon.

Witnesses
say that Mr Eagletail, who was there with his friends and 19-year-old 
fiancé, ran to the water to help after hearing the teenage girl's cries.

Friends said he didn't know either 
the boy or his sister when he reached into the water, grabbing both 
their hands after the girl jumped in after her brother.

The boy emerged downstream minutes later and was treated by emergency crews.

Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras said that it still wasn't clear how he got out but that he didn't suffer any injuries.

By
Friday afternoon emergency officials were tirelessly working to recover
the bodies with a crane expected to be brought in to help remove some 
of the ice.

Grief: The family of Lyle Eagletail, 28, grieves after his body was recovered from the Big Sioux River

Mr Eagletail's fiancee Shawan Rabbitt spoke to the Argus Leader on Thursday while describing herself as 'numbed and shocked.'

'I came over here (under the pedestrian bridge) because we saw a whole bunch of people running over here,' she recalled.

A Facebook page attributed to both 'Lyle N Shawna' list them as newly expecting.

One witness to the scene, 21-year-old 
Napoleon Ducheneaux, said his friend had the boy and woman by their 
hands before he just 'slipped and disappeared.'

'I heard him and the woman talking. He
said something like, "you hold on to me, I'll hold on to you." And I 
kept telling them to come to my voice,' Ducheneaux told KDLT.

Chief Sideras
said rescue crews were working against the river's strong current and 
large amounts of foam, 6-10 feet deep in places, which firefighters were
trying to blow away with water hoses.

Tragic: Her family confirmed her death, saying that she was a 'sweet spirit'

In addition to the fact that the water temperature is hovering around freezing which puts emergency crews at risk of hypothermia, police fear other possible dangers lying beneath.

'There can be rebar. There can be a lot of different obstacles under the water that we have to deal with,' he told KDLT.

The small boy was seen carried away by a police officer while wrapped in a blanket.

'I was with him and he's with family members and he's doing fine,' Chief  Sideras said.

As for Mr Eagletail, his friend and roommate Hunter Turkey described his effort as valiant.

'He does not seem like the type of person
who would normally do that,' he told the Argus Leader.

'I am impressed 
that he did, and I sure hope he makes it.'

Heroic effort: Friends of the man who fell in and is still missing say that he didn't know the teen or the child but rushed to help both of them when hearing their cries

Fears: In addition to the water hovering around freezing rescue officials fear there may be rebar and other dangerous obstacles under the water

The city of Sioux Falls is named 
after the Big Sioux River's cascading waterfalls in Falls Park, a 
tourist attraction where people often picnic or pose for wedding photos.

It is a popular spot in the summer and
spring, drawing about 525,000 visitors annually, according the local 
visitors' bureau.

For the first time in months, the temperature rose to 
around 50 degrees in Sioux Falls on Thursday.

The park was closed Friday as crews continued their recovery effort.

Fatal accidents are rare at Falls Park.

In 2006, the body of 29-year-old Travis Hallan was found just north of the falls after his canoe tipped over.

Progress: Rescue workers taped off the park and worked to eliminate the foam topping the rapids while also slow the water rushing from the top

Condition: Sioux Falls Fire Chief Jim Sideras, whose workers were seen ready and on hand just after 6pm on Thursday, said that the boy is safe, doing fine and with family

In 1999, 26-year-old Slavisa Andric drowned after losing his footing on rocks at Falls Park.

In 1997 a bystander pulled the body of 43-year-old Omar Iasi Ibrahim Warsame from the water below a bridge where he had been fishing.

Barthel said the city could perhaps prevent accidents by fencing off the entire area, but there's some inherent danger with a fast-moving river meandering through the city.

'The Falls is the crown jewel of our city,' said Police Chief Doug Barthel. 'I don't think we want to get to a position where we're going to be totally fencing it off.'
