A former programming manager at Microsoft has been arrested and charged with raping a female janitor on the company's main campus - and then telling police that he was the victim. 

Vineet Kumar Srivastava, 36, is accused of luring the victim into his office in Redmond, Washington, on the night of July 22 and attacking her, according to prosecutors.

Following his arrest, however, the suspected rapist told police that it was the woman who forced him to have sex with her.

Sexual attack: Vineet Kumar Srivastava, a former programming manager at Microsoft, is accused of raping a 32-year-old woman inside Building 27 on the company's Redmond campus

According to investigators, the incident took place at around 11pm July 22 when the 36-year-old senior programming manager approached the 32-year-old female custodian as she was cleaning a third-floor kitchen inside Building 27 on the sprawling Microsoft campus, the location station KING5 reported.

A Redmond police detective told the court that Srivastava lured the woman into his office, where he then pulled down her shirt and showed her a pornographic video on his cell phone.

‘He asked her if she liked it and [the victim] cried, “No” covering her face,’ King County Sheriff's Detective Laura Murphy wrote in a probable cause document, the station KIRO-TV reported.

When the janitor pushed the man away and attempted to flee, the investigator said the Microsoft worker stopped her, unzipped his pants and exposed himself to her. 

Srivastava then demanded that the janitor perform oral sex, saying his wife was in India, according to prosecutors.

The man then fondled her buttocks, slammed the custodian to the floor and proceeded to rape her as she screamed, the detective told the court.

Following the attack, Srivastava threw out a used condom in the trash, which he carried out with him on the way out of the building, the court documents cited by Seattle Post-Intelligencer stated.

The victim reported the alleged rape to her supervisor at a company called ABM, who dismissed her allegations and failed to contact police. Another manager with ABM reached out to authorities a day later.

When police went to interview the 32-year-old victim, they noted that her shoulders bore finger-shaped bruises consistent with a sexual assault. She identified Srivastava as the man who had raped her from a photographic line-up.

The 36-year-old senior programming manager was taken into custody July 26 at his office. During questioning, police said that he presented himself as the victim, claiming that the female custodian forced him to have sex with her.

According to Srivastava, he was afraid of the woman, so he went to his car to get a condom, and then returned to the office to have intercourse with the custodian.

Neighbors in Richmond Ridge, where Srivastava lives, told KIRO-TV that he has a wife and children. A spokesperson from Microsoft said that Srivastava is no longer employed by the company.   

Srivastava has been charged with second-degree rape. He remains free on $75,000 bail and is due back in court later this month for his arraignment.
