Enola Hallerton still fits into the clothes she wore as a three-year-old, and some days gets so tired she has to crawl instead of walking.

The 10-year-old, who measures just 97 centimetres, has a extremely rare disease which means she will never grow more than one metre tall.

Morquio (MPS), an incurable growth stunting disease, affects just 105 children and adults in the UK.

Tiny: Enola Halleron wears clothes that would fit a three-year-old and measures just 97cm tall

Enola, from Blackburn, was diagnosed when she was two-years-old after doctors noticed an abnormality with her hips.

She has grown just 5cm since she was five, which makes her almost 2ft smaller than the average ten-year-old girl.

She also only weighs around two stone more than when she was born.

Enola’s mother Donna Halleron, 40, said: 'She wasn’t a normal baby as she did weigh 11lb 1oz, which obviously is very big.

'The only thing that doctors did pick up on was that she had positinal talipes which made her foot deformed.

'It had been stuck in my rib cage when she was in the womb.

'We were told it would correct itself with physio but, that it may have a knock on effect on her hips, so she was monitored for that.

'It was only after x-rays and check up appointments that a doctor actually said to me, "There is only one way to describe Enola’s hips and that is weird".'

Morquio is a life long condition with no cure. A few adults can live until their 50s or 60s but the majority rarely live beyond their 20s or 30s - which is Donna’s biggest fear for her daughter.

The part time teacher said: 'After her diagnosis I remember looking it up on the internet and just sobbing for two hours.

'It is devastating to think that she may not live a long life because looking at her beforehand she was just a normal child running around.

'It is getting harder for her now though as when she was younger there wasn’t much difference between her and other children.

Morquio's syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive mucopolysaccharide storage disease, which is usually inherited.

Symptoms
 include an abnormal heart development, abnormal skeletal development, 
large fingers, knock-knees, compression of spinal cord and flared ribs, 
short neck, joint laxity and 'duck-waddling' gait.

Patients
 with Morquio's syndrome appear healthy at birth, but often present with
 spinal deformity in the second or third year of life.

LIfe expectancy can be as early as 2 or 3 and some can live up to 60 or 70 years old.

'But now her classmates are almost double her size and she does obviously stand out.

'People treat her like a baby and stare at her in the street but I just have to try and explain to her that they don’t understand.'

Most children diagnosed with Morquio 
disease will not grow taller than one metre and suffer changes to their 
skeleton leaving them unable to walk by their teens.

Enola is missing the enzyme which breaks down cell waste which results in her body retaining materials that could damage her organs, bones and joints.

Despite Enola not growing in stature her internal organs will continue to grow causing life threatening complications.

Her mother said: 'She has been on the replacement therapy trial since 2009 were she is given the enzyme Vimizim once a week for four hours.

'We know that it isn’t going to reverse what she has but it will reduce some of the symptoms that morquio can cause and make her more comfortable.'

Enola now 
depends on a walking frame but Donna is hoping to raise money with the 
help of local charity Al-Imdaad Foundation to be able to buy a mobility 
car.

She added: 'I don’t want every day to be a battle for her.

'There will come a time when she won’t be able to get out of her wheelchair and I want to give her the most normality possible.'
