Disney built two cars for the floating down the Panama Canal scene, but one of them was destroyed

The Herbie films started in 1968 with the The Love Bug where Herbie is bought by Mrs Van Luitfor for her maid

The car, No. 16, was built for a scene where it floats down the Panama Canal.

Disney built two cars for the scene, but the other one was destroyed. 

The car no longer floats, but 'he was rebuilt to be drivable after being discovered in a wrecking yard in California after being auctioned,' according to the listing. 

In addition to the bill of sale, the car comes complete with a binder about its history and exclusive photos. 

The car is registered in Texas and its glove box door is signed by actors Dean Jones and Joaquin Garay III from the film.

Just like in the films, this Herbie has a few tricks up its hood.

The car 'has a remote control that allows his headlights to move from side to side, his front blinkers to blink, his horn to honk, and his windshield squirter to spray at people as they walk by,'

According to the seller, 'It is a blast to see everyone's reaction'.

The Herbie films started in 1968 with the The Love Bug where Herbie is first bought by San Francisco socialite Mrs Van Luit
 for her maid, but returned shortly afterward and purchased by 
race-driver Jim Douglas (Jones).

Douglas's friend, Tennessee Steinmetz, names the car 'Herbie' after his uncle Herb.

The little car had a mind of its own and is capable of driving itself - including becoming a serious competitor in racing competitions.
