A 93-year-old grandmother has finally been presented with her high school diploma - 75 years after leaving school.

Jane Pickett, of Burke, Virginia, had been due to graduate from a New York high school in 1939. 

The graduation ceremony however was held on the same day as another important event in her life - her wedding day.

Ms Pickett, of Burke, Virginia, had been due to graduate from a New York high school in 1939, but the ceremony fell on the same day as her wedding

As a result she never received her diploma, until now, NBC 6 South Florida has reported.

Her daughter, Sharon Mills, arranged for the diploma to be sent by the school so she could present it to Mrs Pickett on the same week as she turned 93.

Ms Mills told NBC 6 South Florida: 'So all the neighbours came down and she had absolutely no idea - her cousins came into town, kids came home from college, but she had absolutely no idea this is what we were doing for her.'

In September last year, MailOnline reported how a 99-year-old woman had been celebrating graduating from the high school she dropped out of eight decades previously.

Audrey Crabtree from Iowa, told KWWL.com that she put her education to one side to get married and take care of her family, but always regretted not completing her studies.

However, she returned to Waterloo East High School and after picking up her diploma, she said that she felt 'so much more intelligent' than she did before.

Her daughter, granddaughter and fellow students watched on as she received her certification.

The star student said she was proudly going to display her new piece of paper at her Cedar Falls retirement home.

Recalling her school days as a teenager, she said that her writing was 'illegible' and her spelling 'original'.
