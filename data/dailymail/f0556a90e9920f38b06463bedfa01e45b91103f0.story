Bradford coach James Lowes tried to remain upbeat despite watching Huddersfield all but confirm his side’s relegation from Super League.

A heavy defeat by the Giants — the Bulls’ sixth successive loss — leaves them 13 points from safety with just six matches left and effectively ends a 40-year unbroken stay in the top flight.

Yet Lowes, who has yet to experience a win since succeeding Francis Cummins last month, was encouraged by his team’s spirit.

Battling: Struggling Bradford Bulls are looking relegation in the mirror

Leader: Bradford head coach James Lowes has been unable to steer his side away from relegation

The Bulls led 16-10 after 24 minutes 
thanks to two tries from former Huddersfield winger Luke George and one 
from hooker Adam O’Brien.

But
 the Giants, for whom winger Jermaine McGillvary scored a hat-trick of 
tries, found their gear in the second half and the Bulls could not live 
with them,

‘The lads 
definitely went down fighting and they will for the rest of the season,’
 Lowes said. ‘We know where we’re at now, that’s definite, but with that
 sort of character, they will get a win before the end of the year.

'The
 lads did themselves justice but we just weren’t clinical enough, 
particularly in the first half, which is a shame because I thought we 
were slightly the better side for most of that half.’

Bradford
 have yet to announce whether they will continue their High Court battle
 to win back the six points docked for going into administration but 
yesterday the players and their coach seemed resigned to life in the 
Championship next season.
