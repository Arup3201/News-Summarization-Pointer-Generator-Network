An ambulance was sent 83 miles to help a critically-ill pensioner - even though he lived barely a mile from a hospital.

Barry Edwards, 79, from Cambridge, had dialled 999 after suffering severe stomach pains. He had suffered an aortic aneurysm - a dangerous condition which occurs when a blood vessel in the stomach swells.

But the call was not treated as urgent and it took two more 999 calls and visits from a doctor and a paramedic before an ambulance finally arrived almost two and a half hours later, the Cambridge News reported.

Critical: Mr Edwards waited for more than two hours for an ambulance despite complaining of severe stomach pains

It had been dispatched from Great Yarmouth in Norfolk, a distance of almost 83 miles and at least an hour and a half drive, despite the fact that Mr Edwards lived only a few streets away from Addenbrooke's Hospital where he was eventually treated.

He died the following morning.

East of England Ambulance Trust (EEAT) said an investigation is underway to establish what happened.

The Trust has come in for major criticism recently after a damaging report about its performance.

The service, which covers Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, was criticised for almost two years over its poor response times, particularly in rural areas, before it was reviewed.

The long way round: An ambulance was eventually sent on an 83 mile journey from Great Yarmouth to Mr Edwards' house on Ashbury Close in Cambridge

MP Anthony Marsh, who carried out the review, said managers had developed a 'sense of helplessness' which had led to the failings. All five non-executive directors of the Trust have since resigned in the wake of the scandal.

Mr Edwards' sister Madelaine described the agonising last few hours before the ambulance finally arrived on December 5 last year.

She told the Cambridge News:  'I knew my brother was going to die. The last few hours of his life were horrific. He deserved so much better than that.'

Mrs Edwards has called for 999 operators to be better trained so that emergency calls are properly assessed.

Her local MP Julian Huppert has written to the Trust asking for a full investigation into the case.

Investigation: MP Julian Huppert described Mr Edwards' treatment as 'appalling' and said lessons must be learned

The Trust told him that a review had been carried out, but as Mrs Edwards was not happy with the conclusions, a fresh investigation is underway.

Mr Huppert described the treatment of Mr Edwards as 'appalling'. He said a full review is necessary so that lessons are learned.

A spokesman for the EEAT told Cambridge News: 'The MP Julian Huppert made an official complaint in December and the concerns were investigated and EEAST sent their findings to Julian Huppert.

'Following this, he wasn’t happy with the outcome so the investigation has been reopened by EEAST and this is an on-going process.

'Once the follow up investigation is resolved, Julian will receive the updates as a matter of priority.'
