Police hunting the rapist of an 18-year-old girl who was left for dead after she was dragged from a bus stop and repeatedly smashed over the head have released an e-fit of the suspect

Police hunting the rapist of an 18-year-old girl who was left for dead after she was dragged from a bus stop and repeatedly smashed over the head have released an e-fit of the suspect.

The victim was waiting by the roadside in Leeds, West Yorkshire, when she was grabbed and hauled to a nearby garden and repeatedly struck with what is believed to be a large stone.

The horrific attack was captured on CCTV - but police say the quality of the footage is not sufficient to identify the attacker.

The young woman was left with serious head and hip injuries and rushed to hospital after the attack around 10.52pm last Friday.

Now detectives investigating the attempted murder have released an e-fit image of the suspect.

The Asian teenager was grabbed from behind by a man,  in his 20s and also believed to be Asian, in the Beeston Hill area of Leeds. He dragged her into a garden and raped her. 

She was assaulted over a considerable period of time which left her with head injuries, a possible broken hip, and lying in blood.

Detective Superintendent Nick Wallen, of West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiry Team, said: 'The victim is making a good recovery in hospital and we are continuing to support her and work very closely with her to gain as much information as we can about the incident. 

'As part of that process, we have been able to produce an e-fit image of the man from her description of him. We would ask people to look at it closely and think very carefully if it is anyone they recognise.

'The description remains of him being of Pakistani or Middle Eastern origin, aged in his early twenties, slim, with receding black hair. He was wearing dark clothing and possibly a light blue top with a hood.

'We are still considering the possibility that the suspect could be somebody who is new to the area. They may be staying locally in a bedsit or hostel and I would like to hear from anyone who runs such premises who thinks they know who it might be.

'Our enquiries are ongoing and we are currently trawling the area for any CCTV footage of the suspect that could assist us in identifying him.

'The incident was captured on CCTV and it is clear there were a number of people in the area at the time, either walking down the road or getting on and off buses on either side of the road. I would like to hear from anyone who was in the area around that time.

A team of specialist forensic officers spent last Saturday recovering evidence from where the girl was found 

'We are still trying to trace two potential witness - a woman who gets onto a Number One bus bound for Leeds shortly before the attack and a man with her who walks away down Beeston Road.

'We are also keen to identify the man seen running along Beeston Road and onto Parkfield Road shortly after the incident.'

Anyone with any information is asked to contact the Homicide and Major Enquiry Team on 01924 334710 or via 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
