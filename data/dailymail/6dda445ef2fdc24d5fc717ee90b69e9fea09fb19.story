Pie anyone? Councillor F John Smith, 80, bizarrely said dead pigeons could provide a source of food

Hundreds of pigeons set to be culled in a town could be used to make pies, a veteran town councillor has claimed.

Councillor F John Smith, 80, bizarrely said the dead birds could provide a good source of food.

He spoke out as Royston Town Council in Hertfordshire voted to ask business partnership Royston First to kill the pests and crack down on people feeding them.

Mr Smith, who quit as a district 
councillor in 2010 after 50 years, said: 'When you use the word cull it 
has a very negative effect on people but there is an advantage to this 
method.

'I'm being 
perfectly serious that pigeon pie is not eaten as often as it used to be
- in other words shot pigeons give us a food source.'

Up
to 600 pigeons roost in Royston and councillors have branded the 
massive mess left by the birds a serious menace for residents.

Pigeon has been used a food source for centuries, although nowadays it is wood pigeon that's served in pies and in restaurants.

However, there is no real reason why urban pigeons cannot be eaten as long as they are checked for parasites and the meat is cooked properly.

Town mayor Lindsay Davidson said pedestrians find pavements 'risky' because 'they are covered in muck'.

Officials have previously considered avian contraceptives, but they were deemed inhumane, and drafting in killer hawks.

Fire gel that would fool birds into thinking roosting spots were ablaze was also looked at.

Now the council has decided culling them is the only way to reduce the flock.

Leader
of the council, Bob Smith, said: 'The problem with fire gel is that it 
would only repel them from wherever we put the gel and we can't smother 
the entire town in gel.

'I'm sure a cull is the best option to get the flock down to a manageable size.'

The council also vowed to continue using spikes and netting to deter the birds from the town centre.
