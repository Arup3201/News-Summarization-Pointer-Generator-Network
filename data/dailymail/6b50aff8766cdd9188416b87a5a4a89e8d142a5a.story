Beneath all that fur, she  may have the healthy glow of an expectant mum... but things are seldom that black and white with panda pregnancy.

So Tian Tian, Britain’s only female giant panda, was placed under 24-hour surveillance – and her keepers put on ‘red alert’ – yesterday after tests suggested she is expecting.

Any new arrival  would be the first panda cub to be born here.

The 10 year-old panda could give birth at any point over the next two weeks

Such
 are the quirks of the species’ biology, however, that nobody yet knows 
for certain if she is pregnant, so keepers will be looking out for signs
 that she is about to go  into labour, such as restless behaviour  and 
bleating.

They even have 
access to CCTV footage via their smartphones and laptops so they can 
monitor her from their homes to ensure they don’t miss a beat.

If
 Tian Tian, whose name means Sweetie, is carrying a baby, the 
pitter-patter of tiny paws could be heard any time in the next two weeks
 – and it might even be twins.

As
 excitement grew yesterday at perhaps the most anticipated birth since 
Prince George’s, she seemed to revel in keeping everyone guessing.

Tian Tian has been relaxes  in her 'off show area' at Edinburgh Zoo today after experts announced there is a high chance she is pregnant

She
 even stuck her tongue out at the crowds at Edinburgh Zoo, where she 
lives with partner Yang Guang, whose name means Sunshine (he wasn’t 
revealing much either, just eating bamboo and sleeping a lot as usual).

Visitor
 Hermione Taylor, 22, from London, said: ‘She looked so serene, and it 
looked like she was smiling. Then she stuck her tongue out. It was as if
 she was saying, “I’m giving nothing away”.’

Pandas
 are notoriously picky about mating and, unfortunately, sparks failed to
 fly between Tian Tian and Yang Guang, both aged eight, following their 
arrival in 2011 after a 5,000-mile flight from China, which is loaning 
them to Britain.

They will stay at the zoo until 2021 and are expected to generate £47million in tourist income for the Scottish economy.

But
 under the agreement that brought them here, any cubs are the property 
of the People’s Republic of China and will be taken to China at the age 
of two, the age they would naturally leave their mother in the wild.

Tian
 Tian was artificially inseminated in April using some of Yang Guang’s 
sperm, and some frozen sperm from Bao Bao, a ‘genetically important’ 
member of their endangered species who died at Berlin Zoo last year.

Panda
 foetuses do not start to develop until the final weeks of  the 
five-month gestation period, and at birth the cubs weigh on average only
 5oz – 1/900th of their mother’s weight – so there is nothing so  simple
 as a ‘baby bump’ to judge a pregnancy by.

There is a chance Tian Tian, seen roaming her Edinburgh Zoo enclosure today, could reject the foetuses or that her body could reabsorb them

Yang Guang enjoys his free time at Edinburgh Zoo while Tian Tian, who is possible pregnant, rests in her 'off show area'

After Yang Guang and Tian Tian failed to mate naturally, experts artificially inseminated the female giant panda with Yang Guang's semen so the cub or cubs will still be his

Instead,
 tests on Tian Tian’s urine revealed a high level of the hormone 
progesterone. This indicates she is pregnant, a zoo spokesman said, but 
it could equally mean she is undergoing a ‘phantom pregnancy’.

The
 spokesman added that even if she is pregnant there is a possibility she
 may not carry to full term and her body may reject any foetuses.

Her
 keepers have spotted her displaying nesting behaviour, looking sluggish
 and sleeping for up to 16 hours a day, all indications she may be 
pregnant. But no one will know  for sure until she starts going  into 
labour.

Ian Valentine, 
director of giant pandas for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, 
said: ‘If indeed she is pregnant, this is an extremely risky time for 
panda pregnancies.’

Despite
 the lack of certainty, staff are planning for a birth – incubators have
 arrived at the zoo and Chinese panda keeper Haiping Hu, from  the China
 Conservation and Research Centre, has flown to Edinburgh to assist.

The arrival of Yang Guang (pictured) and Tian Tian in Edinburgh two years ago has done wonders for the economy as well as aiding Scotland's relationship with China, it is claimed

The cub or cubs will stay in Edinburgh Zoo until it is two and then return to China. It is at the same age when Giant Pandas are traditionally released into the wild
