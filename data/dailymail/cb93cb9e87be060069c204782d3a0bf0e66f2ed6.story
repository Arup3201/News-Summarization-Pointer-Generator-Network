A woman desperate to become a mother died after a surgeon cut open her bowel during a procedure aimed at helping her to have children.

The slit went unnoticed by medics at Birmingham Women’s Hospital and Pavla El Nahas died at her home in Birmingham, just over two days later.

The 39-year-old had fatally inhaled vomit after becoming sick with bile seeping from the cut, an inquest heard.

Pavla El Nahas married Sam in 2010. They had both longed for children and discussed baby names

Paramedics found Mrs El Nahas in bed, not breathing and without a pulse. They confirmed she died at just before 1am on June 23 last year.

Her distraught husband, 30-year-old trainee security guard Sam, said after the hearing at Sutton Coldfield Town Hall: 'I was missing someone call me ‘dad’ and she was missing someone call her ‘mum’ - those were our dreams.'

Mr El Nahas, added: 'We argued about having a son - I wanted to call him Abdul and she wanted to call him Youssef.

'I wanted blue eyes and she wanted brown eyes. We had great hopes. We weren’t bad people, why did this happen to her?'

The couple met in Mr El Nahas’s native Egypt in 2006. He was a barman at the Sharm El Sheikh hotel where Pavla was staying on holiday.

They married there two years later, before moving to England in 2010.

However, after unsuccessfully trying for children the following year, TK Maxx warehouse worker Czech-born Mrs El Nahas was referred to the women’s hospital.

Surgeons carried out a laparoscopy on June 20 last year, which is a minimally invasive procedure to explore her abdomen and pelvis. Medics said they could 'see nothing wrong' after the procedure.

Grieving: 'We weren¿t bad people, why did this happen to her?' Mr El Nahas asked

Pathologist Dr Peter Acland, who carried out the post-mortem examination, said he discovered a gynaecological procedure carried out in the Czech Republic 'several years' earlier had resulted in Mrs El Nahas’s bowel fusing with abdominal wall scar tissue.

This, he said, meant the usually free-moving organ wasn’t pushed away as the surgeon cut into Mrs El Nahas.

Women’s hospital consultant obstetrician Dr Peter Thompson later told the hearing an internal investigation had cleared the surgeon of any wrongdoing and up to three in every 1,000 patients who had the procedure suffered such an abdominal perforation.

Coroner Aidan Cotter ruled Mrs El Nahas died following elective surgery. He said: 'This does not mean that anybody did anything wrong, nor does it mean they didn’t do anything wrong.'

He added: 'The surgery caused a small perforation in her bowel. That perforation later leaked and caused an infection. That infection made her very ill.

'Just that illness alone could and would have caused her death, but she actually died because while she was so very ill, some of her gastric contents came up and went into her lungs.'

In a statement, Women’s Hospital NHS Trust chief executive Dr Ros Keeton said: 'The trust was saddened to hear of the death of Mrs El Nahas. A thorough investigation was launched and, while no problems were found with the medical care provided, we took the opportunity to review and improve communications with patients following surgery.'
