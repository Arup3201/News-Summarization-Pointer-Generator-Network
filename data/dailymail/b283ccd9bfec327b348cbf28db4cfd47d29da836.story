The British Paralympic team took part in an official welcome ceremony to the Sochi 2014 Paralympics today.

The team of 15 athletes joined their fellow athletes from around the world to attend the celebration in the Paralympians' Village.

The welcome ceremony traditionally begins with a flag-raising ceremony and is attended by the representatives of the National Paralympic Committees, as well as mayors and vice mayors of the Paralympic Villages.

Millie Knight of Great Britain, the youngest member of the squad, has been selected as flagbearer for Paralympics GB

Millie Knight, the youngest athlete to represent Paralympics GB, will have the honour of carrying the flag for the British team at the Opening Ceremony tomorrow.

Knight turned 15 on the day she was selected to Paralympics GB and is set to make her Games debut in Sochi, competing in the sport of Alpine Skiing with her guide Rachael Ferrier.

Millie said: 'This is the best feeling ever! I'm so excited, I can't wait to carry the flag at the Opening Ceremony and I'm honoured to be out there representing Paralympics GB alongside all of the other nations.

'This was such a surprise but I'll try and make the team proud. I was really excited just to be competing in Sochi and to be going to the Opening Ceremony so it just keeps getting better and better.'

Party atmosphere: Most of the squad will not attend the Opening Ceremony tomorrow, as they have events early on Saturday

'I hope it's going to be a great atmosphere. I watched the Opening Ceremony for the Olympics and I'm sure they're going to put on a good show.'

Paralympics GB Chef de Mission Penny Briscoe congratulated Millie, saying: 'At just 15 years of age, it is a fantastic achievement to be competing at your first Paralympic Games and I am delighted to confirm that Millie will be carrying the flag for the British team during the celebrations for the Opening Ceremony.

'Millie is a very talented athlete and an exciting prospect for the future, therefore she is the perfect representative for the team on this occasion. I hope that she enjoys every second of the ceremony in the Fisht Stadium, but I know that her focus will remain on her races which will soon begin in Rosa Khutor.

Millie will be joined at the Opening Ceremony by her guide Rachael Ferrier and fellow skiers Ben Sneesby and James Whitley, with the remainder of the athletes watching from their respective villages as they are due to compete early on Saturday.

The Sochi 2014 Paralympic Winter Games will run from 7-16 March.
