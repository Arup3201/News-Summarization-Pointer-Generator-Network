Borussia Monchengladbach have opened talks about taking Chelsea midfielder Thorgan Hazard on a permanent deal.

The 21-year-old younger brother of Eden has been on loan at Borussia since the start of the season and made 20 appearances, scoring one goal. 

Hazard joined Chelsea from Lens in 2012 but had a two-year loan spell at Zulte Waregem also.

Monchengladbach will have to convince Chelsea to sell, however, if he is to remain in Germany.

Hazard's contract with the Blues lasts until 2016 but negotiations suggest he is open to leaving.

He has one goal in the Bundesliga this year, having netted against Hertha Berlin on December 6.
