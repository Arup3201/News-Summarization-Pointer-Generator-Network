Shrek star Mike Myers today urged Scots to remain in the United Kingdom.

The actor, who voiced the Scottish accent of the ogre in four box office hit films, said he ‘loves’ Scotland and wants voters to reject independence in September’s referendum.

He joins a growing list of international stars including Kermit The Frog, David Bowie and JK Rowling voicing fears about breaking up the 300-year-old union.

Is the independence dream ogre? Mike Myers, who voiced Shrek's Scottish accent, has come out against independence

It is a fresh blow for Alex Salmond who has seen the tide of public opinion turn against his dream of Scotland going it alone. 

The latest opinion polls show support for independence is falling, down to just 35 per cent in a YouGov survey this week.

Some 54 per cent say they are planning to vote no in September’s historic referendum.

More than four in 10 also fear independence would be bad for the Scottish economy and leave them financially worse off.

Canadian-born Myers, whose parents were from Liverpool, made his name in Wayne’s World and Austin Powers before reaching a new audience with the Shrek series of films from 2001 to 2010.

Interviewed on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he initially appeared reluctant to express a view on the contentious issue of Scottish independence.

Asked how Shrek would vote in the referendum, he laughed: ‘Wow… what a fantastic question… that I couldn't answer.’

Pressed on what Shrek would say, he replied in the voice of the character: ‘Shrek wants what the will of the Scottish people want.’

But Myers then added in his own accent: 'I love Scotland. I hope they remain part of Britain - and if they don't, I still love them.' 

First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured meeting the Queen at Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh yesterday,  has seen support for independence slip away

FOR INDEPENDENCE

Sir Sean Connery

Actor Sir Sean Connery: ‘The people of Scotland are the best guardians of their own future'.

Actor Alan Cumming : ‘The world is waiting for us. I know Scotland is ready.'’

The Proclaimers: ‘Scotland has huge national resources, with its people, its wave power – all the possibilities that this country has...we need to take charge of our own affairs'

Comedian Kevin Bridges: ‘If the referendum as tomorrow, I'd probably vote yes.’  

The Krankies

David Bowie: ‘Scotland, stay with us.’

Singer Rod Stewart : ‘I’d hate to see the Union broken after all these years — and I don’t think it will happen.’

Susan Boyle: ‘I am a proud, patriotic Scot, passionate about my heritage and my country. But I am not a nationalist.’

Billy Connolly: ‘I don’t believe in having more layers of government that ordinary people will have to pay for. I think it’s time for people to get together, not split apart.

'The more people stay together, the happier they’ll be.'

Wee Jimmy Krankie aka Janette Tough: ‘Alex Salmond can sod off ’cos I don’t want it. We don’t live in Scotland so we won’t get to vote and I don’t think it’s fair.’

Andy Murray

Singer Annie Lennox: ‘It will be taken by the citizens of Scotland themselves, who need to seriously weigh up the pros and cons, as the responsibility lies wholeheartedly upon their shoulders.'

Tennis player Andy Murray: ‘‘It’s very difficult to have an opinion these days because half the people will agree with you and half of the people will think you’re an absolute idiot’

Actor James McAvoy: ‘'I won’t be getting involved at all. It’s just counter-productive to my job, it’s not what I do, and I don’t think it’s helpful to have me involved in it.’

The comments were seized on by pro-UK campaigners. A Better Together spokesman said: 'It's no surprise Mike Myers doesn't support separation. He knows a fairytale when he sees one.'

However, he risks the wrath of the so-called cybernats who have used social media to attack high profile figures who have supported the campaign against independence.

Harry Potter author JK Rowling faced a torrent of vile abuse from nationalist cyber bullies after revealing she donated £1million to the fight against breaking up Britain.

The best-selling author said she loves Scotland and wants ‘to see it thrive’.

Though she had prepared herself for the attacks, the extreme level of online abuse sparked condemnation from across the political spectrum, including from pro- independence politicians.

When David Bowie made a statement supporting the Union was read out on his behalf at the Brit Awards in February. 

In response to his message, ‘Scotland, stay with us’, one cybernat told him on Facebook to ‘f*** off back to Mars.’ 

Asked whether he agrees with Bowie, Kermit told The Big Issue in March: ‘Absolutely!’

However, he revealed his other half was preparing for Scotland to go it alone.

‘I understand that Miss Piggy is willing to serve as Queen of Scotland if there is a split. So you may want to guard your castles,’ Kermit added, while promoting his latest film in London. 

Myers once claimed he chose to give the green ogre a Scottish accent because it pitted him against the English aristocracy who ruled the land of the fairytale.

He told USA Today: ‘There is a class struggle in Shrek between the fairy-tale kings and queens and the common people

‘I always thought that Shrek was raised working-class. And since Lord Farquaad (the villain) was played English, I thought of Scottish.’

Alex Salmond’s panicked aides have ordered a massive publicity campaign – paid for using public money – in an attempt to reverse public opinion.

Fearing they have been massively ‘out-gunned’ by the Westminster Government, the SNP administration plans to send a pro-independence document to every household in Scotland at a likely cost to taxpayers of more than £700,000. 

It is the latest sign of how the jittery Yes campaign fears it is losing momentum with less than three months to go until polling day.

The latest YouGov poll for The Times says support for a Yes vote in September's referendum has fallen to 35 per cent, while 54 per cent said they would vote No.

Just two per cent of people said they did not plan to vote, suggesting a high turnout on September 18. Nine per cent said they did not know how they would vote. About 12 per cent said they were undecided or did not intend to vote.

When the non-voters and the undecided are removed, Yes has 39 per cent and No 61 per cent. YouGov interviewed 1,206 Scottish adults between June 25 and 29.

The poll will make grim reading for Mr Salmond, who has struggled to counter the idea that independence would be bad for Scotland.

Just 27 per cent of those surveyed said Scotland would be better off economically by severing its links with the rest of the UK, compared to 49 per cent who said worse off.

Similarly, 43 per cent said they personally would be financially worse off, while just 17 per cent thought independence would make them better off. 

Lord McConnell said that supporters of devolution must 'keep making the case' for remaining in the UK

Former First Minister Jack McConnell returned to frontline politics yesterday to warn that the fight against Scottish independence could last for generations.

The ex-Labour leader, now Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodale, said that supporters of devolution must 'keep making the case' for remaining in the UK even if the Nationalists are defeated in September.

In a wide-ranging speech to mark the 15th anniversary of the opening of the Scottish parliament, he said:

Lord McConnell, who was First Minister from 2001 until 2007, said he took the decision in May to join the fight against independence, and wanted to use Holyrood's 15th anniversary to make his first speech of the campaign.

Speaking at The Hub in Edinburgh, the 54-year-old said: 'I have watched over the past two years the debate around the referendum on independence become increasingly polarised between Unionism and nationalism.

'I have never described myself as a Unionist, although I respect most who do. I am not a nationalist, although I respect most Scots who are. I am a patriot, a democrat and I believe in a better Scotland in a better world.

'I appeal to those who believe in Scotland, who care about Scotland, who are democrats and patriots - but not nationalists - to think twice.

'Not to save the Union. But to save devolution, to save home rule inside the United Kingdom.'

Lord McConnell told journalists: 'If the outcome is that we stick with home rule inside the UK then... we have to continue to make the case for that system of government for Scotland.'

He also set out the case for further devolution of powers beyond a No vote, and wider consideration of how the UK is governed. 

He said: 'I would like to see a conference for the new Union, where there is a genuine debate about how the UK should be governed in the 21st century because the UK has now changed. 

'I would like to see a commitment on the part of all three main Westminster parties after the referendum that they would look at having such a conference whatever the outcome of the next year's general election.'

Outlining his own vision for a reformed House of Lords, he said it could be similar to Germany's Bundesrat, which represents the sixteen Länder - federal states - at the national level.

Former Independent MSP Dennis Canavan, chairman of the Yes campaign, boycotted the historic opening of the Scottish parliament 15 years ago. But yesterday he hailed Holyrood's record and used the anniversary to announce that a small group of ex-MSPs now back independence.

The group includes outspoken Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party leader John Swinburne and former Tory MSP Nick Johnston.

All Better Together parties should reach 'consensus' on more powers for Holyrood if there's a No vote, and there should be a 'conference' to decide how the UK is governed in the future.

The House of Lords should be replaced with a senate made up of political appointees representing the regions and nations, mirroring Germany's second chamber.
