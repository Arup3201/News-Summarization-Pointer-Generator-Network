Doctors have admitted they are  doling out antidepressants too freely as figures show a huge variation in prescription rates across the country.

Overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 – from 15million to 50million.

But this varies in different areas, ranging from 71 items per 1,000 patients in Brent, North London, to 331 per 1,000 in Blackpool.

Overall the numbers of prescribed pills have more than trebled since 1998 ¿ from 15million to 50million - and now a top GP has said the trend must stop

Dr Des Spence, a senior GP who writes for the British Medical Journal, said: ‘We do over-prescribe.

'There needs to be a recognition among doctors that this is a problem because there is a lot of denial.

‘We’ve got into this mindset that depression is a chemical imbalance and that giving a tablet is going to make it better.’

Although Dr Spence practises in Glasgow, he said the issue was a ‘huge problem’ in England. He blamed drug firms for pushing their products on GPs, saying: ‘The pharma companies have had a very negative impact and are a major force on the prescribing.’

The figures, which emerged in a report from the Nuffield Trust think-tank, also showed prescriptions for antidepressants increased at the fastest rate during the economic downturn between 2008 and 2012.

Over this four-year period they rose by an average of 8.5 per cent annually, compared to 6.7 per cent between 1998 and 2008.

Soaring numbers of antidepressants were dished out as the financial crisis took hold, with Blackpool, East Anglia and the north of England suffering the most

Experts claim this is because higher numbers of patients are diagnosed with depression after traumatic events such as losing their jobs or running up debts.

But the number of prescriptions has risen at a much faster pace than the number of patients being diagnosed with the condition – implying pills could be being handed out too freely.

Between 2008 and 2012, while antidepressant prescriptions rose by 8.5 per cent, cases of depression increased by only 3.8 per cent. Prescription rates were highest among young female family doctors, the report found.

Professor Nick Barber, director of research at the Health Foundation, which was also involved in the study, said: ‘The report clearly shows a significant increase in antidepressant prescriptions.

‘A crucial finding for doctors and patients to consider is that there is real variation in prescription rates across GP practices.

‘These differences imply that certain practices have a propensity to over- or under-prescribe. This could suggest that not enough attention has been given to individual patients’ needs, including the need to avoid possible side effects of these medicines.’

Isabella Goldie, of the Mental Health Foundation, said: ‘In the brief time that is allocated for [GP] appointments, medication can seem like the only realistic option.

‘Although we are very supportive of the progress made to increase access to psychological therapies, for those patients who are living increasingly difficult lives, it can be challenging to find the energy to engage with a programme of therapy.’

The most commonly-used antidepressants are Prozac and Seroxat, which work by changing the levels of certain chemicals in the brain.

Possible side effects can include anxiousness, nausea, dizziness and headaches, although these are less common in newer types of medication.
