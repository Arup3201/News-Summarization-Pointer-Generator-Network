Susan Larkin is alleged to have put a bag over the head of an elderly dementia sufferer in care home 

A care home worker ‘put a plastic bag over the head of a resident with dementia and laughed at her as she was on the toilet’, a court has heard.

Susan Larkin, 35, denies taking Celia Handley, who was in her seventies and suffering from severe, progressed dementia, into the lavatory and placing a bag used for incontinence pad disposal over her head at Peel Gardens care home in Colne, Lancashire.

But her colleague Sahra Suleman, who says she witnessed the incident, was so shocked she went into another toilet cubicle and broke down in tears.

Burnley Crown Court heard that Larkin, who is from Burnley, claims the allegation is malicious and has been made by staff members after no action was taken when she stole a pair of sunglasses in 2012.

On the day of the alleged incident, which happened at some point between March 17 and 26, 2013, Larkin was working with Ms Suleman.

Prosecutor Andrew Smith said Mrs Handley needed assistance from two carers to visit the bathroom. Ms Suleman left the room briefly and when she came back the alleged victim was sitting on the toilet.

Mr Smith alleged: ‘Sahra Suleman saw Susan Larkin take a plastic bag, used for the disposal of incontinence pads, and place it, without warning, over the head of Celia Handley.

‘She stepped back, as witnessed by Sahra Suleman and crossed her arms, leaving the bag in place. Sahra Suleman is not entirely sure, but thinks she may have laughed briefly before removing the bag from Celia Handley’s head.’

‘She describes herself as being shocked. It was there a few brief seconds. She left the room and went to an adjoining cubicle, where she herself broke down in tears, no knowing what to do.’

Mr Smith said some time the following week Ms Suleman confided in colleague Wendy Davis.

She recalled that it was on April 1 that she was told by Ms Suleman and she decided she would write a letter to her manager about the disclosure, which was dated April 5.

She handed it to care home manager, Malcolm Rowley, to act upon.

The defendant was suspended from work shortly after and police were informed.

It appeared just before the disclosure, there had been a second admission relating to the defendant - the allegation of theft of a pair of sunglasses in 2012.

The defendant accepted she stole the glasses in 2012, which had been left at the home by Rosemary Shaw when she had been visiting her elderly mother.

Mr Smith said: ‘It’s the defendant’s case that this allegation [the ill-treatment allegation] is a malicious one, as a direct result, flowing from the decision by the care home not to take action in relation to the sunglasses.’

The prosecutor said Larkin was arrested over the ill-treatment allegation of Mrs Handley on April 10 last year and was interviewed.

She denied any ill treatment of the alleged victim, outlined the incident involving the pair of sunglasses and suggested that may be a possible motive why other members of staff had made the allegation against her.

The trial continues.
