Michael Cheika admits his Wallabies must be more aggressive if they are to enjoy a successful northern hemisphere campaign.

Cheika got his reign as Australia head coach off to a winning start as his side ran in six tries but they were given a major fright by a bunch of hungry and lively Barbarians who scored five of their own.

The Aussies face Wales in Cardiff next weekend, France and then Ireland before returning to Twickenham to play England at the end of the month.

Cheika admitted: ‘Wales will be a lot tougher next week. They are a strong side who love the rough stuff and get stuck in. It will be more physical and aggressive in Cardiff so we will need to be prepared.

‘It’s a win but it’s clear the real hard work and most important battles lie in the weeks to come here. We needed to start the tour well but I was hoping not to have to get out of my seat during the game. Sadly, I did a few times!

‘There were good and bad things, and plenty to work on. I gave some guys the chance to try and impress but most of the guys who finished the Rugby Championship will probably be involved in Cardiff next weekend.

‘Wales are a very strong, powerful side, and difficult to beat in their own backyard. We know how tough that will be, so being pushed so close by the Barbarians might be a good thing.’

Cheika’s men got the job done but neither Wales coach Warren Gatland nor England’s Stuart Lancaster will have been too concerned by their indifferent display against a makeshift side who had just been together for a couple of weeks.

The Barbarians were 40-22 behind before the colourful ‘Honey Badger’ Nick Cummins inspired a fightback which only just failed.

Barbarians coach John Kirwan claimed: ‘The guys were out on their feet at one stage but looked down at that special Barbarians badge and regained some energy.

‘To push the Wallabies so close with this team was a fantastic effort. All the guys had fun, enjoyed themselves and it showed on the field.’
