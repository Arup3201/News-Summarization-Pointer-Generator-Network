Stephen Lawrence’s brother is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination.

Stuart Lawrence says patrol officers have pulled him over ‘loads of times’ during the past few years without proper justification.

The final straw is said to have come when the teacher was stopped while driving through South-East London in November.

Family: With his murdered elder brother Stephen

Sources said Mr Lawrence, 35, was left furious and deeply sceptical about the reasons police gave for wanting to question him.

The father of one has instructed lawyers to lodge a formal complaint with Scotland Yard. This will include a detailed log he has kept of all the times he has been stopped.

The move will send shock waves through the Metropolitan Police force, which in 1999 was accused of being institutionally racist by the inquiry into Stephen’s murder.

Details of Stuart’s legal action emerged after his campaigning mother, Doreen, appeared on ITV News yesterday.

She said: ‘Families up and down the country are still experiencing racism. My son has been stopped how many times, driving around in London. Racism is still very high.

‘We need to keep highlighting it all the time. Racism has not gone away.’

Reflecting on her elder son’s death in April 1993, she said: ‘It still doesn’t seem like 20 years. It’s been a long journey.’

Mrs Lawrence said more would be done this year to ensure no other family has to go through what she endured, including the launch of a programme for fairer community policing.

In 1999, Neville Lawrence, Stuart and Stephen’s father, was stopped and interviewed over a robbery allegation as he drove through London.

Mr Lawrence and his cousin were held for up to 20 minutes as they were quizzed by two officers investigating a robbery half an hour earlier.

The pair had nothing to do with the offence, and it emerged that Mr Lawrence had made a formal complaint about the incident.

He and Doreen, who was then his wife, received £320,000 compensation from the Met for its botched handling of their son’s murder.

Stephen, 18, was killed by a gang of white youths as he waited at a bus stop in Eltham, South-East London, in April 1993. Two of that gang, Gary Dobson and David Norris, were jailed for life exactly 12 months ago yesterday.

Mrs Lawrence continues to press for the arrest of others involved in the murder. During the trial, the court heard that five or six thugs had set upon her A-level student son.

Following the trial, Stuart revealed how he had rebuilt his life following his brother’s brutal murder by continuing his studies in London and then graduating from university with a degree in graphic communication before embarking on a teaching career.

He said it is sometimes years before he tells work colleagues and acquaintances that he is Stephen’s brother.

‘I’ve worked hard to be my own person, at my profession, so no one can say I am just Stephen Lawrence’s brother,’ he told a Sunday newspaper last January. ‘People say they can try to imagine what you’re going through, but the only people who really do know are those closest to you. And for me that’s my partner.’

He said he had been pulled over by police ‘loads of times’.

‘They come out with the same excuse, that it’s because cars like this one have been stolen in the area,’ he added.

‘I don’t tell them I am Stephen Lawrence’s brother, but I give my name and then say my mum is on the Stop and Search Community Panel and then they suddenly become increasingly apologetic.’

The panel was set up by the Home Office amid allegations that police had overstepped the mark with the searches.

Recent research showed that black people are six times more likely to be stopped by police than white people.

The Metropolitan Police faced fierce criticism for its original investigation into Stephen’s death.

A public inquiry branded the force institutionally racist and claims were made by family lawyers that some officers were influenced by Norris’s former drugs baron father. The breakthrough in the investigation came when a cold case team of forensic scientists found tiny traces of blood, hair and fibres on clothing seized from the homes of Dobson and Norris. During the trial, jurors were shown police surveillance footage from 1994 of the pair using racial slurs.

Scotland Yard said last night: ‘The use of stop and search is an important tool to combat crime and it is one of a range of tactics deployed daily in order to keep Londoners safe.

‘We have worked hard over the years to establish robust scrutiny processes and transparency is essential to us.

‘The consistent message from our engagement with the public is that the wider community support stop and search as long as it is carried out fairly and professionally and that officers are accountable for their actions.

‘We are not complacent and  continually review our progress to ensure we are delivering a policing service that meets the needs of all Londoners – not least in the area of stop and search.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
