Absconded: Wayne Whitley, 40, walked out of HMP Kirkham in Lancashire 12 days ago

An armed robber serving a life sentence for a series of violent raids has become the third convict to walk out of the same open prison this month.

Police have warned the public not to approach Wayne Whitley, 40, from Manchester, who went missing from HMP Kirkham, Lancashire, 12 days ago.

His escape was revealed by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) today as a raft of bleak figures revealed a leap in the number of on-the-run inmates in the past year.

Whitley, who disappeared on July 19, is the third prisoner to abscond from HMP Kirkham this month. Philip Stephenson, 33, and Gareth Robinson, 24, left the Category D facility earlier in July.

Stephenson was serving a sentence for firearms offences while Robinson was in prison for burglary, Greater Manchester Police said at the time.

Whitley, who has links to areas across Greater Manchester, is a black man of slim athletic build, said a statement from GMP. It is unknown what he was wearing when he left prison.

'He is not to be approached by members of the public,' said Detective Inspector Robert Cousen, from GMP's Serious Crime Division. 'If anyone sees him or knows of his whereabouts, please contact GMP on 101 immediately.'

Sources who would prefer to pass on information anonymously are asked to contact Crimestoppers.

Det Insp Cousen said: 'I would also urge Whitley to hand himself in at his nearest police station and to remind people that if anyone is found to be assisting or harbouring Whitley, they too will face being arrested and a possible prison sentence of their own.'

Elsewhere, it emerged that a prison officer had part of his ear bitten off by an inmate during an attack at Nottingham Prison.

The latest prison walk-out emerged as Ministry of Justice figures showed, in the words of shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan, 'violence is up, deaths in custody are up and the number of prisoners going on the run is up.'

A total of nearly 230 inmates escaped or absconded from prisons in England and Wales last year, the figures showed, 10 per cent more than the previous year.

These include 137 who walked out of open prisons, including Michael Wheatley - known as the 'Skullcracker' - who sparked a nationwide manhunt after absconding from HMP Standford Hill on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent.

Two male criminals fled jails and another two escaped prisoner escorts, the figures show. Ninety absconders who have disappeared from prisons in the last decade were still at large at the end of last month, and another 79 have not returned after being granted temporary release since 2004.

Meanwhile the number of attacks on prison staff soared to its highest level for six years - up by more than a tenth to 3,363 in the 12 months to March - prompting suggestions that jails in England and Wales have become 'places of extreme violence'.

And the number of prisoners who died in custody jumped by nearly a quarter in the year to March to reach its highest level for almost a decade.

A total of 225 inmates died in jail in 2013/14, compared with 181 in the same period the previous year. This was the highest number since 2005.

Critics said the figures were evidence that the country's prisons were 'in crisis'.

Mr Khan told the Press Association: 'The Government is trying to hide the sheer scale of the failings in the Ministry of Justice from the public by trying to pretend there's not a problem, let alone a crisis.

'This is all evidence of the incompetence of David Cameron's Government.

'The evidence is piling up that the Government has caused a prison crisis. The courses, training and healthcare needed to make sure prisoners are reformed aren't happening.

'Staring at their cell walls for hours on end, surrounded by death and violence, will do nothing to stop offenders committing further crimes on their release.'

The national crowding rate in prisons was 22.9 per cent - meaning nearly one in four prisoners is being held in a cell, cubicle or room where the number of occupants exceeds the 'uncrowded' capacity.

Glyn Travis, of the Prison Officers' Association, told PA: 'The prison population is increasing and despite changes introduced by the Ministry of Justice we still believe that inappropriate prisoners are being sent to open conditions as the service tries to manage its available cellular accommodation.'

'Incompetence': Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan, left, said today's figures showed there was a 'prison crisis', but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling, right, defended the service's performance in a 'period of change'

Conservative Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said the service had experienced a 'significant period of change' and admitted it had been 'a challenge'.

Although the number of absconds has risen year on year, the total of 225 was the third lowest since the current method of counting was introduced in 2004.

Mr Grayling told PA: 'Over the last couple of years we have seen a major programme of reform across both prisons and probation - aimed at providing the best service to the public while lowering the cost to the taxpayer.

'In this current economic climate all public services are required to help ease the burden. We are not exempt from that and have reduced our overall budget by 24%, through sensible and well-considered reforms, commended by the National Audit Office.

'As with any significant period of change - coupled with prison population increases higher than expected - it has been a challenge. We are responding to and managing the additional pressures but prisons are still running safe and decent regimes.'

Referring specifically to the figures on absconding prisoners, Mr Grayling said open prisons and temporary licence are 'important tools in rehabilitating long-term offenders', but stressed they 'will not be used at the expense of public safety'.

He added that absconds have reached record lows under the coalition Government, while the eligibility for open prisons has been tightened.

Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'The tragic rise in the numbers of self-inflicted deaths in custody is the most vivid of the flashing warning signs of a prison service placed under unprecedented strain.'
