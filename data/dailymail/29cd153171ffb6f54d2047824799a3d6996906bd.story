Arrest: Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, allegedly had sex with three high school students

The high school teacher whose baby was allegedly fathered by one of her students has been charged with 41 counts of sex and oral copulation with a minor.

Laura Elizabeth Whitehurst, 28, from Redlands, California, was arrested last week after the mother of the boy - now 17 - reported their alleged year-long relationship and subsequent birth of their child to police.

The Citrus Valley High student  is believed to have been present at the birth. She met him while acting as his adviser at the school.

Since then, two more former students have come forward to claim they had a sexual relationship with Whitehurst.

The charges filed yesterday by the San Bernardino County District Attorney’s office reflect the alleged relationships with the three teen students.

Whitehurst is charged with 30 counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, and 11 counts of oral copulation of a person under 18.

If convicted, she faces up to 29 years in prison. Her bail was increased from $25,000 to $750,000 in light of the recent allegations.

She told investigators she and the father of her child began having sex at her apartment after a Disneyland trip in 2012.

Another victim was a 14-year-old freshman during the time of their alleged relationship.

'The victim, now 20, told police that he and Whitehurst had sex in her classroom before school, as well as at her apartment and in her car,' a police news release stated.

The latest victim to come forward said 
he was 16 when he had sex with Whitehurst when she was his English 
teacher at Redlands High School.

The victim, who identified himself to NBC4 as
22-year-old Michael Cooper, said the class had been told to write about
their dreams and afterwards, Whitehurst told him she had dreamed of 
kissing him during a school field trip.

'I didn't have anything to say 
really,' he said. 'I was like, "Oh really, that's crazy," and a couple 
of days later, we ended up actually kissing.'

He
said that they kissed in her classroom and two weeks later, she invited him to her apartment and 
he spent the night.

They 
continued to have sex a few times a month but he said he never felt as 
if they were in a relationship, but when they contacted each other, they
both knew what was going to happen, he said.

'When
it happens, you're kind of like, 
all right, this is pretty badass,' he said. 'You know, my teacher is 
into me. I was 17 and I was having a good time is what it was.

'I didn't feel like a victim; I'm not 
scarred for life or anything. To be honest, I had a 
good time when it was going on.'

But
in spring 2008, he said he stopped returning the teacher's messages and
calls as he had a girlfriend and had started to feel guilty. They 
eventually broke the relationship off amicably, he said.

He added that he did not get preferential treatment in class because of their relationship.

Cooper
has filed a police report but told authorities he does not wish to 
press charges. He told NBC4 that he wanted to share his story to 
encourage other victims to come forward.

Whitehurst said that they had a 
relationship 'but not to that extent', Redlands police Detective Natasha
Crawford said during a phone interview.

According to the Redlands Police 
Department, Whitehurst's underage lover - with whom she had a child - was 16-years-old during their 
year-long relationship, which allegedly started last summer.

The
mother of the alleged victim, who is now 17, became 
aware of the affair between her son and his teacher and notified the 
Redlands United School District, which in turn contacted police. 

Whitehurst gave birth to a child June 18, and police say her former student is the father.

Since her arrest last week, Whitehurst had been placed on administrative leave.

‘Nothing is as important to us as the safety of our students and the District takes this arrest very seriously.

'We are fully cooperating with police in their investigation of this matter,’ Assistant School Superintendent Sabine Robertson-Phillips said.

Safe space: Whitehurst taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley high School, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser

The educator graduated from Redlands East Valley High School and taught English to sophomores at Citrus Valley, where she was also a Link Crew adviser and a Compact Careers Club adviser.

In 2010, Whitehurst was also an assistant soccer coach. She previously was a volunteer soccer coach for American Youth Soccer Organization in Redlands.

The news blog PE.com reported that Whitehurst's father, Dale Whitehurst, has served as principal of Brywn Mawr Elementary and Moore Middle schools in Redlands.

He also worked as assistant principal at Redlands Easy Valley high School.
