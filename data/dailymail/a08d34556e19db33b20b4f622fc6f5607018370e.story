The designer behind Cathy Freeman's iconic white 2000 Sydney Olympic Games bodysuit has revealed a crucial identifying feature on her creation which could ultimately clarify if a recently found garment is the original.

Jennifer Irwin has admitted that she had sewn the Olympic rings onto Freeman's suit upside down while rushing its completion the night before it was meant to be worn.

'I sewed the suit up around midnight when I was told who would be wearing it,' Ms Irwin told News.com.au

Cathy Freeman's bodysuit went missing in September 2000 from her dressing room at Stadium Australia

'On the original one I sewed the Olympic rings upside down.'

After the suit disappeared from Freeman's dressing room at Stadium Australia in September 2000, where the former athlete lit the Olympic torch in the white garment, Ms Irwin created a replica for display purposes.

However, the minute detail could be crucial in identifying whether the item that was anonymously handed in to the Melbourne Cricket Club this week is the historical suit that mysteriously went missing over a decade ago.

'It has been a great mystery since 2000 and it is a suit that we all want to see again,' Australian Olympic Committee secretary-general Fiona de Jong told News.com.au.

'This is a pretty unique item of clothing. If it can be validated, we would like to see it celebrated and allow all Australians to see it.'

A Victoria police spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia an item had been handed over to them by a representative of the Melbourne Cricket Club at the Melbourne East station.

'The article was alleged to have been stolen in NSW in the year 2000,' he said.

'Police are attempting to confirm the authenticity of the item and are liaising with the NSW Police.'

The Australian Olympic Committee have released a statement about the find.

They said the MCC staff member had 'received it anonymously' and it would hopefully settle a lot of unanswered questions.

'On that night, Cathy was soaked while standing under a waterfall after a mechanical fault delayed the lighting of the cauldron,' the statement said.

'She removed the suit after the ceremony and it has not been seen since.

'What happened to the suit has been the subject of much debate over the years as it is a major part of Australia's Olympic history.

'We are hoping the item of clothing handed to the MCC Museum is authentic and the mystery is finally solved.'
