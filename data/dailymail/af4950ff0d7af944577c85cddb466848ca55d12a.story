A  report obtained this week by the Daily Mail revealed that publicity surrounding a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s home came about only because South Yorkshire Police revealed details of the raid to a BBC TV reporter

The fundamental precept of English law, which protects and safeguards the liberty of every one of us, is that a man is deemed innocent until proven guilty.

Does this still hold good? Disturbingly, it appears not, particularly in the case of wealthy celebrities against whom unproven accusations are levelled.

A damning, unpublished report obtained this week by the Daily Mail under the Freedom of Information Act, says that the world-wide publicity surrounding a police raid on Sir Cliff Richard’s Berkshire home last August came about only because South Yorkshire Police revealed details of the raid to a BBC TV reporter, Dan Johnson.

At the time of the raid, no charge of any kind had been made against Sir Cliff, 74. A man in his 40s had simply accused the immensely popular singer of sexually molesting him in 1985 when he was a schoolboy under the age of 16, at a rally in Sheffield held by the American evangelist Billy Graham.

Indeed, at the time, the police had not even spoken to Sir Cliff about the matter. He had no idea of the identity of his accuser, and the first he learned of the raid on his home was when he saw it on television at his estate in Portugal.

Even though the police have now interviewed Sir Cliff under caution, six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man.

Yet, as a result of the disgraceful conduct of South Yorkshire Police, and of the BBC, Sir Cliff’s once spotless reputation has been damaged and besmirched by acres of newsprint world-wide, by sordid and sensational headlines, and by a giant question-mark in the minds of people who think there is ‘no smoke without fire’.

Last August, BBC Reporter David Sillito had reported live from Cliff Richard's home as it was raided by police 

I have known Sir Cliff for more than 40 years. I vividly recall the day I sat face to face with him, discussing long-standing rumours about his sexuality.

It was May 1970, and we were backstage at a theatre in Bromley, Kent, where the singer — then plain Mr Richard — was in rehearsal for his serious-acting stage debut.

He had amazed the theatre world by daringly electing to portray a young gay man in Peter Shaffer’s play Five Finger Exercise, a character who falls in love with his male tutor.

My questions were tentative, and he picked up on this immediately. An expression of knowing mischief crossed his face. ‘You want to know if I’m gay in real life,’ he said. ‘Well I’m not. I’ve been telling people that for years, but they never believe me.’

Cliff was then 29 and had been a major star for more than a decade since his recording of Lionel Bart’s song, Living Doll, went to No.1 in the charts in 1959 and established him as an ersatz British version of Elvis Presley.

With his slicked-back dark hair, swarthy looks, chocolate-brown eyes and gyrating hips, he introduced an entirely new style of sex appeal into British showbusiness, and rumours about his hotly debated sexual inclinations swirled around him from the beginning.

A BBC news crew had reported from the entrance to the Charters estate in Sunninghilll, near Sunningdale, Berkshire where Cliff Richard owns a property during the raid although no charges had been made against him

In 1964, he very publicly embraced Christianity, drastically remodelled his image and became the Peter Pan of Pop and Britain’s Mr Squeaky Clean.

Sexually, he was to remain an enigma, and his private affairs have long been a subject of intrigue and fascination. For 30 years he lived with his business manager Bill Latham, who had a girlfriend, Jill, although she left him eventually.

For the past 13 years Cliff has shared his various homes with a burly, gruff New Yorker and former Roman Catholic priest, John McElynn, whom he insists is simply a friend and companion.

The point is that whether Sir Cliff Richard is gay, straight, bisexual or — as his biographer, Steve Turner, concluded after exhaustive interviewing, ‘asexual’ — none of this makes him a paedophile.

Of course, where there is strong and persuasive evidence of child abuse or of sex crimes then cases must go to trial. But, I repeat, no charges have been made against Sir Cliff who has described the allegation of sexual molestation as ‘completely false’.

Yet on the strength of his pre-eminence as an entertainer and the shocking collusion between South Yorkshire Police and the BBC, which so pruriently filmed the raid, the allegation has been flung across the world virtually unchallenged, at appalling cost to his reputation.

Meanwhile, Sir Cliff’s accuser — who waited almost 30 years to come forward — shelters behind the cloak of anonymity offered him by our legal system.

The first Sir Cliff learned of the raid on his Berkshire home (pictured) was when he saw it on television at his estate in Portugal

I can’t help but wonder whether there is something opportunistic about the timing of the allegation. After all, Sir Cliff’s fortune is estimated to be in excess of £40million, and in the wake of the conviction and imprisonment for sex abuse of the publicist Max Clifford and the entertainer Rolf Harris, the air is heavy with talk of claims for compensation for long-ago abuses. 

The report unearthed by the Mail pulls no punches. Independent investigator and former Chief Constable Andy Trotter is harshly critical of South Yorkshire Police for leaking details of a ‘highly sensitive and confidential’ investigation to the BBC.

The report also reveals that the Chief Constable of South Yorkshire, David Crompton, was informed of the leak and ‘could have rescinded the agreement’ with the BBC. He failed to do so.

The belated admission by South Yorkshire Police that their actions were ‘ultimately flawed’, and that they ‘regret the additional anxiety which was caused to Sir Cliff Richard’, comes nowhere near to resolving this matter.

And although the BBC, with its customary arrogance, insists ‘The Home Affairs Committee has already endorsed the way the BBC handled the story; we have nothing further to add’, they still have a great deal to answer for.

For the distress caused to Sir Cliff is just one element of this outrage. The actions of the police and of the BBC have militated against the possibility of the singer ever receiving a fair trial should the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) bring a charge.

Police had carried out the raid in connection with allegations that the singer had molested a schoolboy under the age of 16, in 1985, but no charges had been made against Sir Cliff and though the police have now interviewed him under caution, six months on there is still no charge against him and he remains an innocent man

In any case, questions are being asked about the CPS.

After the police and justice system failed so abysmally to prosecute Jimmy Savile when he was alive, there seems to have been a desire to atone for this failure by pointing the finger at any celebrity accused by anyone of sexual abuse — and dragging their name through the mud.

And I believe the CPS, by single-mindedly pursuing prosecutions in such cases, encouraged this.

It was the CPS that was behind the trials on sex offence charges of three Coronation Street stars, Michael Le Vell, Andrew Lancel and William Roache. While these men were clearly not knights in shining armour, their cases all ended in humiliating ‘not-guilty’ fiascos costing millions to the taxpayer.

Meanwhile, the police have in recent times launched highly publicised investigations into big-name celebrities such as Jim Davidson, Jimmy Tarbuck and Freddie Starr, against whom no charges have been brought.

Sir Cliff Richard, I believe, is made of sterner stuff than all the rest. A highly astute businessman with a strong sense of justice, he was the prime mover in getting the copyright in music recordings extended from 50 to 70 years, ensuring that entertainers benefited as a result. It is now known as ‘Cliff’s Law’.

If he decides to sue for the undoubted damage that has been caused to him, it could cost the BBC and the police millions. This story is far from over.
