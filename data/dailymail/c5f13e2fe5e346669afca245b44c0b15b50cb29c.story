Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson decided to donate his brain for medical research after realising the 
drugs he was taking to treat his Alzheimer's disease were having little effect.

The celebrated television director who
died on Boxing Day at the age of 83 was determined to help other 
dementia sufferers after being diagnosed with the condition in 2011.

After lengthy discussions with wife 
Mary and son Jamie, the family contacted the Alzheimer's society 
and were put in contact with the Brains for Dementia Research project.

Son Jamie revealed his father had hit 
upon the idea after completing a fundraising walk saying: 'This 
Alzheimer's business, it really is terrible isn't it?'

Jamie told the Telegraph: 'He kept saying it over and over again. I have to say I had to agree with him.'

His father then added: 'The quicker they can find a cure the better, so they are welcome to my brain.'

Jamie said his father continued to raise the subject over the next few months and on one memorable occasion he 
announced loudly to couple they had met on holiday: 'Well I'm 
donating my brain to medical science'.

Mr Anderson, who insisted on being 
cremated because he did not want to 'waste space' had been taking the 
drug Aricept to treat his condition. It is designed to slow the advance of the disease but the effects are limited.

At first Mr Anderson was not sure about donating his organs but changed his mind as he realised the drugs weren't having any effect.

Just months before his death Gerry Anderson spoke of his passion to continue writing despite suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

Talking in June at his home in Nuffield, near Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, he said: 'I'm not worried about forgetting my career. It's an odd thing this, losing one's memory.

‘Not everybody is affected in the same way and it's no good going around everyday worrying about it. I can remember clearly things that happened 60 or 70 years ago.

‘I can remember conversations with friends and the actual words we used. My career is like an encyclopaedia. I made so many shows, worked with so many crew members that I cannot pick out specific memories.

‘I can still write stories though - I can continue. So many people have told me that my work is instantly recognisable because within three seconds I've blown a city apart.’

Son Jamie said: 'Despite the fact he was very confused he was obviously thinking about it. It mean't something to him.'

Mr Anderson made his name in the 1960s
with a series of hit sci-fi puppet shows including Captain Scarlet and 
Joe 90, but is best known for Thunderbirds which followed the adventures
of International Rescue and the Tracy family.

The series - which used a form of marionette 
puppetry dubbed 'supermarionation' - became hugely popular around the 
world.

Talking about his condition at the 
launch of the Alzheimer’s Society’s Memory Walk, Mr Anderson said 'the 
bitterest blow' was not being able to drive.

He said: 'It meant that I couldn’t go 
to Pinewood studios where I worked, and this depressed me enormously 
because my film work was my life.

'Suddenly my life was cut off. Since 
I’ve had Alzheimer’s I’ve realised how debilitating it is. It can affect
your life in so many ways that you don’t think about.'

Asked how he came to realise he was suffering the condition, he said: ‘I don’t think I realised at all. It was my wife Mary who began to notice that I would do something quite daft like putting the kettle in the sink and waiting for it to boil.’

She became concerned when, in early 2010, he took hours to return to their Oxfordshire home in Henley-on-Thames after forgetting his route from Pinewood Studios, a journey he had made for decades.

His wife persuaded him to visit a doctor, where he was asked to copy a series of simple geometric drawings. He thought it would be a simple task — only to realise he was hopeless at it.
