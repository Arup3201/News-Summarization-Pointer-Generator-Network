Bitcoin mania continues.

One New Yorker is offering a SoHo pad for sale at nearly $2 million but wants the buyer to pay in Bitcoin.

The luxury real estate property on Spring Street in the trendy neighborhood in lower Manhattan was listed on Thursday on BitPremier, a luxury website for 'astute buyers in the Bitcoin community.'

The condo is located in the Trump SoHo, a 46-story hotel condominium. The unit is a one bedroom, 1.5 bath and is 741 sq. ft.

Amenities in the building include a roof deck, swimming pool and room service, the newly launched BitCoin retail website stated in the listing. 

Alan Silbert, the founder of BitPremier, told Business Insider that the SoHo condo is just among the numerous luxury items that will be available to Bitcoin owners on the new website.

'There are plenty of Bitcoin millionaires out there, and it's burning a hole in their pocket,' he said.

'I think buyers will be easy to come by.'

'We're finding a lot of wealthy, smart people are getting into the game with Bitcoin,' he explained.

'I think as the ecosystem matures, I think you’re going to see a lot more of that.'

Bitcoins are created, distributed, and authenticated independently of any bank or government.

The a digital currency, bought and sold on a peer-to-peer network independent of any central 
control, introduced four years ago.

Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are among the select group of Bitcoin millionaires. 

Speaking to The New York Times, the twins acknowledged that they own roughly 1 per cent of Bitcoin, which equates to about $11million.

The currency's cryptographic features make it virtually immune from counterfeiting, and its relative anonymity holds out the promise of being able to spend money across the Internet without fear of censors, regulators or nosey officials.

The linchpin of the system is a 
network of 'miners' - high-end computer users who supply the Bitcoin 
network with the processing power needed to maintain a transparent, 
running tally of all transactions.

Bitcoin is a type of online currency that can be exchanged for dollars and vice versa.

The
main idea behind it is to facilitate cheap, anonymous transactions 
policed by its community of users and is built around trust rather than 
relying on institutions like governments or banks.

Bitcoin status as a digital currency is debatable, it is entirely a digital 
product but is not regulated and it has a limit of 21million, which is 
predicted to last until 2140.

The finite nature of Bitcoin means it performs more like a commodity, such as gold.

It first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009.

It
was introduced by an obscure hacker whose identity is a mystery but is 
known as Satoshi Nakamoto, which is thought to be a pseudonym for the 
person or group that created it.

Each Bitcoin is a piece of computer code that has been generated through very slow computer processing, also known as 'mining.'

Users
choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables
them to receive, give and trade coins from other users.

Bitcoin can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces such as eBay.

The
tally is one of the most important ways in which the system prevents 
fraud, and the miners are rewarded for supporting the system with an 
occasional helping of brand-new Bitcoins.

Cryptographers
argue over whether Bitcoin is well-designed, but the true test of any 
currency is whether it can be used to buy anything.

Increasingly,
Bitcoin is passing the test. From hard drugs to hard currency, songs to
survival gear, cars to consumer goods, many retailers have welcomed the
money, whose unofficial symbol is a dollar-like, double-barred B.

When it was first introduced, the currency was initially unknown  to everyone but hackers and the computer-savvy, they have now caught the eye of investors.

Users can send money directly from 
their computers to others on the other side of the world, and coins can 
be used to buy real goods, swapped for cash on exchanges or used for 
speculation.

The currency has gained in prominence 
amid the euro zone sovereign debt crisis as more people start to 
question the safety of holding their cash in the bank.

The value of a single Bitcoin began racing upward amid growing media attention, smashing past the $100 mark in early April.

Bitcoins shot up in value in March when investors took fright at Cyprus' plans to impose losses on bank deposits.

The best-known exchange for the currency is Tokyo-based Mt. Gox.

Bitcoin was trading near $110 on Mt. Gox on Thursday.
