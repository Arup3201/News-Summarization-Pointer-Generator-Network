A Burger King customer bit into his food to discover an unwanted extra topping - a slug.

Manminber Singh, 37, was horrified to see the creature crawling over a piece of lettuce in his Chicken Tendercrisp burger, bought from the Darlington branch of the American chain on Friday.

Mr Singh, of Thornaby, Stockton-on-Tees, said: 'I was really shocked as I really love this burger and never had anything like this happen before.

The slug is thought to have arrived in the restaurant in pre-washed lettuce, according to a council spokesman

'The staff did not seem bothered and the manager just wanted to give me my money back.

'She said it was a problem with the chiller but I think it is because the place is not properly clean.

'I want health and safety people to come and lock them down.

'This might have affected my health as I have problems with my stomach and this could put me in more danger.'

The Chicken Tendercrisp usually contains a breaded chicken breast, tomato, lettuce and mayonnaise.

A Darlington Borough Council spokesman said: 'Our Environmental Health Officers visited the outlet and have begun preliminary investigations on their food management procedures.

'From this initial visit it would appear that the slug has come in on pre-washed lettuce which was then overlooked in the processing of the food order.

What Mr Singh found: The slug was an unwanted extra on his lettuce

'There is no apparent evidence of an insect infestation. Our officers will be meeting with senior managers from the outlet early next week to discuss procedures more thoroughly.'

A Burger King spokesman said: 'As a global brand, we aim to provide the highest levels of food quality and service in all restaurants so that our customers have a great experience with us every time.

'We are taking this situation very seriously and are conducting a full investigation. We greatly value customer feedback to ensure we get our service, restaurants and products right every time.'
