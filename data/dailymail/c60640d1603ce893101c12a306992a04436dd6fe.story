A cringeworthy video of a martial artist attempting - and repeatedly failing - to punch and kick through a plank has emerged online.

And to add to the embarrassment, the only time the taekwondo practitioner is able to smash a piece of wood, a fragment flies off and hits a young girl in the face.

Before he attempts to destroy the board, the man in a taekwondo uniform with a Scottish flag on it gives the crowd one of the boards and said: 'Send that round so to make sure they know it's real.' 

Scroll down for video

Oh dear: This video shows possibly the worst martial arts demonstration ever. The man's repeated blows fail to break the wood

If at first you don't succeed... the instructor bravely continues his war with the piece of wood

He then adopts a combat-ready stance before attempting to punch through it as another man holds it, only producing a painful-sounding thwack and an unscathed piece of wood in the video, posted on Liveleak.

Undeterred, he punches the board another three times, with similar and equally disappointing results.

Ever the optimist, the man then repeatedly kicks the stout board, before deciding that two burly men are required to hold it for his strikes to succeed. 

Success! After getting two men to hold the board, the martial artist finally smashes the board, sending a piece of wood flying

Cringe: A splinter of the piece of wood hits a girl watching the demonstration

Ouch: The little girl grabs her head after she is hit by the flying piece of plank

The martial artist goes over to make sure she's OK

He saves face when the board satisfyingly splits after a side kick, even getting a round of applause, but the triumph is short-lived as a fragment of the wood flies off and smacks a young girl in the face, causing her to burst into tears.

He rushes over to check she's OK, and the girl appears to have just been shocked and is comforted by a woman, presumably her mother.

Most people would have called time on the demonstration at this point, but the man gamely battles on.

The big guns: But even a spinning heel kick fails to destroy his wooden adversary

The martial artist checks the unscathed piece of wood

As the two men grip the plank he subjects it to a barrage of ineffectual blows, drawing nervous giggles from the crowd.

Unfortunately, viewers never find out the fate of the second piece of wood as the video ends shortly after.

One internet wag commented: 'It is not taekwondo, it is taekwondont!'

Undeterred, he lets rip on another board... with little success
