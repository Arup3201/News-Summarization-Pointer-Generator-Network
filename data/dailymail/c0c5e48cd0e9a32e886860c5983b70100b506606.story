Australian drug smugglers Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan have penned a desperate letter from death row, begging the Indonesian government to spare them.

The Bali Nine ringleaders are running out of options to avoid the firing squad, which is being planned for the next two weeks.

Their friend, Pastor Matius Arif, says the pair are 'very sad' their bid for a judicial review was rejected in the courts on Wednesday.

He read an open letter - addressed to the Indonesian government and signed by both Australians - to reporters outside Kerobokan jail on Thursday, which argues they are more useful alive as they work to rehabilitate other prisoners.

This comes after reports that the fate of the Bali Nine ringleaders may have been sealed by the results of a text message poll which found 52 per cent of Australians, in principle, support death sentences for overseas drug traffickers.

'We beg for moratorium so we can have chance to serve Indonesia community (sic)' the letter reads.

Mr Matius says the letter was handwritten by Sukumaran.

'There's so many testimonies about what they're doing inside,' he told reporters.

'I also personally request the government to make a special commission or a special team to investigate what they're doing inside.'

The team should then report on the rehab programs to the president, he said.

The application for a judicial review detailed the work of Chan, 31, and Sukumaran, 33, to assist others through chaplaincy and art programs.

Denpasar District Court determined it didn't meet the 'new evidence' criteria for a review.

It was the last legal option for the pair, who have been denied clemency by President Joko Widodo.

Barrister Julian McMahon says their team is still examining the options after Wednesday's setback.

'It's certainly a major blow, that's for sure, because having this second appeal was probably our best option in having all the issues canvassed,' he told ABC Radio.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott, too, says diplomatic efforts to save them are continuing.

'We are not going to engage in last-minute, megaphone diplomacy but I just want to assure people that the Australian government has left no stone unturned to try to ensure that these two Australians on death row have their sentences commuted,' he said.

The men's families visited Kerobokan jail again on Thursday, including mother of Andrew Chan, Helen, and Sukumaran's brother Chintu who wrapped his arm around their mother Raji.

Sydney men Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost their last chance of escaping execution by firing squad after a second judicial review of their case was rejected on Wednesday.

Their lawyer Julian McMahon told the Sydney Morning Herald a 'snap' poll, commissioned by Triple J radio show Hack about death sentences, in which 2123 Aussies voted 'yes' or 'no' by text message, has been picked up by the Indonesian government to justify the drug smugglers' deaths.

The results of the poll by Roy Morgan Research were published in January under the headline 'Australians think Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran should be executed'.

But the question that was actually asked  that month was much broader and was only referring to death sentences in principle and not the two men's specific case.

Radio show Triple J commissioned the research by Roy Morgan Research and also posed the question on their Facebook page

The radio show published the results of their poll on 26 January saying '60 per cent of young Australians don't think the government should do more to stop the execution' 

‘In your opinion if an Australian is convicted of drug trafficking in another country & sentenced to death, should the penalty be carried out?,’ the question said.

Mr McMahon told SMH the result ‘is now a tool being used to get my clients killed’.

‘The AG and the ambassador have publicly relied on the SMS poll as a factor justifying execution. They say that it pushes them to do it, that they have Australian public support,’ Mr McMahon reasoned.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Triple J Hack show for comment.  

Gary Morgan, executive chairman of Roy Morgan Research, defended way the poll was carried out to the SMH.

When the poll results were originally published Morgan said in a statement: ‘A slight majority of Australians (52%) say that Australians convicted of drug trafficking in another country and sentenced to death should be executed.

Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail 

Indonesia has used results from radio host Tom Tilley's (pictured) Triple J listeners to justify sending Aussies to the firing squad, according to the Bali Nine ringleaders' lawyer 

‘However, there is a clear gender split with men (60%) in favour of the death penalty being carried out while only 46% of women believe that convicted drug traffickers overseas should be executed.’ 

Indonesia's courts rejected an application for a judicial review into the cases of Chan and Sukumaran again on Wednesday despite a strong campaign for mercy being pushed from the 'highest level' of Australian government.

Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop and Tony Abbott promised they 'continued to raise the cases' with the Indonesian government. 

'My personal view is that an execution of drug traffickers will not stop the problem of drugs in and out of Indonesia, that there’s a much broader approach that needs to be taken, however, the Indonesian government seems to be intent on pursuing the death penalty for drug traffickers,' Ms Bishop said.

Lawyers for the Bali Nine ringleaders on Friday applied for a second judicial review of their case, examining past errors of the law and their transformation over a decade in jail.

Denpasar District Court spokesman Hasoloan Sianturi on Wednesday told reporters the application was rejected. 

The spokesman said after considering the documents put forward for a judicial review, known as a PK, neither man's application could be accepted.

'The documents of that PK will not be sent to the Supreme Court,' he told reporters in Bali.

Indonesian authorities have continued planning for the execution of Chan, Sukumaran and others even while the application was before the courts.

Foreign affairs minister Julie Bishop said she and Tony Abbott have 'continued to raise the cases' of Chan and Sukurmaran with the Indonesian government.

It comes after a slight glimmer of hope from the Denpasar District Court chief, Judge Sugeng Riyono, who was yet to make a decision on the matter on Tuesday.

'There is no difficulty. We just have to look at all the regulations, including the Constitutional Court decision, the Supreme Court decree as well as the joint decision that was made in January,' Mr Riyono previously said according to News Corp.

Chan and Sukumaran's lawyer, Mr McMahon, argued that his clients had clearly exhibited that they had been rehabilitated since their sentencing in 2006.

'Anyone who studies the facts in the case of Sukumaran and Chan would immediately know they should not be treated as if they are merely criminals. In fact because of the Indonesian penal system they have become reformed prisoners and valuable contributors helping Indonesia. It simply makes no sense now to kill them,' Mr McMahon told News Corp.

It was revealed on Monday that the Bali Nine pair would be killed by a firing squad in the next round of executions.

The pair, who have been on death row since 2006, could face death at any stage under a crackdown by the Indonesia government on drug cases. 

According to Nine News Sukumaran and Chan will be taken in the dead of night from their cells at Kerobokan Prison in Denpasar and flown to Jogjakarta. From there they will take a five-hour journey through the villages of Java before they arrive at the port of Cilicap.

The men will then be taken by boat into restricted waters, where they will get their first glimpse of the notorious correctional centre on Nusa Kambangan.

From there the Australian men will be housed in one of the seven prisons on the island, where they will live out the remainder of their days before they are lined up in front of the executioners. 

Nusa Kambangan is where the Bali bombers faced the firing squad and where six drug criminals were executed two weeks ago.
