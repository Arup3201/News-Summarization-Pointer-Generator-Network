The Duchess of Cambridge has been dubbed the queen of thrift because of her penchant for recycling her outfits.

But it seems she is not the only royal who isn't afraid to be pictured in the same clothes more than once.

Queen Letizia of Spain has worn the same black and white check top, by Danish label Designers Remix, three times in the last four months.

The 42-year-old wore the windowpane check top  for the third time today as she attended the Fundeu 10th Anniversary at BBVA Foundation in Madrid.

The glamorous mother-of-two paired the top with black trousers and high heels and added a pop of colour to her ensemble with red lipstick and a red clutch.

The Spanish royal was last seen in the Designers Remix top in November when she welcomed charity campaigners to the Zarzuela Palace on the outskirts of Madrid.

On that occasion she teamed it with red heels and more subtle make-up.

She also wore the garment in October as she spent the day manning a Red Cross stall in Madrid, again wearing it with red heels.

Today the queen received a warm welcome when she arrived at the anniversary event without husband King Felipe, 47. 

She wore a long, black coat on her arrival which she took off before she went on stage to make a speech.

It's been a busy week for Letizia, a former journalist, as on Sunday she and the king attended a Spanish cultural awards ceremony.

For that occasion, she looked stylish in a navy, cream and black £1,753 illusion dress designed by Carolina Herrera.

Thanks to her choice of flattering dresses, smart suits and designer garments, the queen is gaining a reputation as one of the world's most stylish women.

Harper's Bazaar magazine recently observed that: 'Since her marriage to Prince Felipe of Spain in 2004, Queen Letizia has cemented her status as a royal style icon. 

'With an air of casual elegance, the former journalist infuses her professional wardrobe with chic statement pieces and a hint of sultry appeal.'
