Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli is being investigated by Greater Manchester Police for ‘threatening’ a woman who took photographs of his red Ferrari F12 Berlinetta.

Police were called to a housing estate at 3pm on Thursday in the Wythenshawe area of Manchester, where the 24-year-old was reportedly visiting his mum Rose Barwuah.

GMP are investigating Balotelli's use of 'threatening behaviour' after the forward demanded the woman stop taking photographs of the £240,000 car he shipped from Italy during the summer.

Price: £240,000

Brake horsepower: 730

0-62mph: 3.1 seconds

0-124mph: 8.5 seconds

Top speed: 211mph 

It is understood a woman claimed that Balotelli moved towards her daughter, who was taking a photograph of the red sports car.

A spokesman for GMP said: ‘We are investigating a report of threatening behaviour following an incident in Wythenshawe. Officers will be speaking to all concerned in due course.’

Liverpool Football Club said they would not be commenting until all the facts had been established.

It comes the day after Balotelli was caught swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half time during Liverpool’s 3-0 defeat in the Champions League at Anfield. 

Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers admitted he would ‘deal with’ the controversial £16million signing from AC Milan, who was substituted during the interval.

Rodgers reminded the former Manchester City player that receiving souvenirs at half-time is not part of the 'club culture' at Anfield.

‘I had a similar incident last year and it was dealt with internally,’ said Rodgers. 

‘It’s exactly the same. I heard about it when I came off pitch. If you want to do that, it’s something you do at end of the game and something I will deal with.’
