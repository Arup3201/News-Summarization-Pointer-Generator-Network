A video captured the dramatic moment a racing speedboat ran aground and skimmed several dozen feet to slam into spectators.

The footage, filmed at Field of Dreams, a sprint boat racing venue near Albany, Oregon, shows spectators running for their lives as the out-of-control vessel comes hurtling towards them.

It is unclear whether there were any injuries, but the speed of the vessel and the manner in which it slams through barriers straight into watching crowds suggest people may have been hurt.

Dangerous sport: A video captured the dramatic moment a racing speedboat ran aground and skimmed several dozen feet to slam into spectators

The boat skids across several dozen feet of dry land as it hurtles towards where crowds are watching 

The film was uploaded to the LiveLeak yesterday, where it's been viewed by nearly 30,000 people

The boat came to a halt in a stand by the side of the spectators. It is unclear whether anyone was hurt

The film was uploaded to the LiveLeak 
video-sharing website yesterday, where it has already been viewed by 
nearly 30,000 people.

Sprint
boat racing is a motorsport in which crews of two race 13 foot aluminum
hulled boats around a small 20-30 turn, water filled 12-18ft wide track
at speeds up to 80mph.

The 
boats, powered with NASCAR-style V-8 engines, can generate from 300BHP 
to more than 100BHP as they race against the clock around the tortuous 
courses.

Laps generally take just 45 to 60 seconds.

The video, filmed by a spectator, shows a boat as it tears around the Field of Dreams track, kicking up spray.

However,
as it enters a straight pointing directly at the watching crowds, the 
driver appears to make a miscalculation, hitting a bank at the side of 
the course and skimming across it.

When
it re-enters the water of the course it is too late for boat's driver 
to steer into the next turn and the boat jumps straight onto the bank 
and skids across grass, slamming into the spectators enclosure.  

The cameraman and a group of other spectators make their way towards where the boat has finally ground to a halt, but he is unable to get the cockpit into the frame, so it is not clear whether the boat's drivers were injured.

Sprint boat racing, or jetsprinting as it's sometimes known, originated as an organised sport in New Zealand in 1981, and events were originally held in natural braided rivers.

A crew consists of the driver and a navigator whoe guides the driver through the course - typically via simple hand signals - pointing the hand in the direction that the boat must go at the next intersection.
