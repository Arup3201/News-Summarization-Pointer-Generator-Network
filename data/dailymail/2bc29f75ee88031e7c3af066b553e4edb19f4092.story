A tech tycoon, his wife and their four grandchildren were killed after a devastating blaze ripped through their Annapolis mansion in the early hours of Monday, it has been confirmed.

Emergency crews in Annapolis were scrambled to the blaze at the waterfront home of Don Pyle, a former CEO, but were unable to save the couple and the children. 

Don Pyle, 56, lived in the 16,000sq ft home with his wife Sandra. Authorities are yet to confirm the deaths but a local headteacher sent out a letter to staff and students on Tuesday confirming the family had been killed and naming the grandchildren as Lexi Boone, Katie Boone, Charlotte Boone and Wes Boone.

Stacey Boone, mother to two daughters Lexi and Katie with Sandra Pyle's son Randy Boone, also confirmed they had died, according to The Capital. 

In a message on Facebook Tuesday, she wrote: 'I never knew that I could hurt this badly. It’s unreal. All one big nightmare that I can’t wake up from.'

It is believed the other two children are the Pyles' grandchildren through another son.  

Severn School headmaster Douglas Lagarde announced the school would be closed out of respect for the tragedy

It is assumed but not confirmed that some of the grandchildren were enrolled at the Lower School of the $17,770 a year private prep school. 

It came as criminal investigators pored over the ruins of the house for any signs the blaze could have been arson. Specialists with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives now say the fire is 'suspicious' - partly because of how quickly it ravaged the home.

Picturesque: In 2008, Pyle revealed  that the house had been built to be a combination of a castle and a beach house

Sources at the bureau told CNN that the fire engulfed the mansion so fast that they suspect that chemicals may have been used to accelerate the burning.

The official in charge of the ATF's investigation would not confirm whether the blaze was suspicious to DailyMail.com. Special Agent William McMullan said that specialists from across the country were headed to Annapolis, and would send in trained dogs to sniff out any traces of accelerant chemicals, which would help determine whether the blaze could have been a deliberate attack.

On Monday, all authorities would say is that six individuals including four children were unaccounted. They could not confirm whether they had died in the blaze, and continue to investigate. Relatives, employers, investigators and reporters have all so far failed to reach either of the Pyles.

Neighbor Caroline Wugofski said the Pyles often held parties at their home. She described them as 'genuinely nice people.'

In a press conference Tuesday afternoon, firefighting officials said they are still looking for the six people. 

They would not speculate on whether the fire was deliberate - but also refused to describe it as an accident. He did, however, reveal that the gate to the property was left open at all times, and that the house had no sprinkler system installed.

Huge loss: The home, built in 2005 to be a cross between a castle and a beach house, was worth an estimated $9million

Don Pyle grew up in nearby Baltimore County and worked his way to the top table of several billion-dollar tech companies.

In a recent interview with the Washington Post, he said he started off as a salesman, and moved to progressively more important roles before taking the reins at companies with links to Silicon Valley. His latest role was as the COO of ScienceLogic, an IT support company based in Reston, Virginia.

He would hold fundraisers for worthy causes at his house. At one in 2008, he told the Baltimore Sun the house had been especially designed to be a combination of a castle, his preference and a beach house, which Sandra wanted.

His luscious property stood facing Church Creek, a picturesque inlet not far from the Chesapeake Bay. It has an estimated $9million value.

Situated on its own portion of exclusive Childs Point Road, the home boasted a courtyard, swimming pool and access to a speedboat jetty.

Real estate listings for the home say it had seven bathrooms and was part of a 7.8-acre estate. The modern, two-storey home, which was built in 2005, also has attic space and a basement.

Photographs of the mansion before it burned down show at least four cars parked outside the elegant stone construction, which has several turrets as part of its architecture.

Though most of the fire appeared to have been extinguished by late Monday morning, some firefighters were still reportedly pouring water on the ruins at midday - almost nine hours after the fire started. Fire chiefs said they were not able to search the house during the blaze, and that it is unlikely they will be able to confirm whether there are any victims until later today.

ScienceLogic would only confirm that Pyle works for them. A spokesman told DailyMail.com: 'Don Pyle is the Chief Operating Officer for ScienceLogic.

'There was a fire at his home last night and the case is under investigation. We have no further comment.'

Emergency crews: Because the house was nowhere near a fire hydrant, the Anne Arundel County Fire Department deployed a boat to a nearby jetty
