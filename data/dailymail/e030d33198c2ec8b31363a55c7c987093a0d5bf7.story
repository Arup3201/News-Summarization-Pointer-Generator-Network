A sapphire ring found in a Yorkshire field by a metal detecting enthusiast may have been owned by royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries, experts said today.

Archaeologists say that nothing like the Escrick Ring from that period has ever been found in the UK before.

The expert group, convened by the Yorkshire Museum in York, believes the ring could have royal connections.

Lucky: Michael Greenhorn found the 1500-year-old ring in a field near Escrick, south of York

Curator of archaeology at the museum Natalie McCaul said: 'What this workshop has shown is that this sapphire ring is even more special than we had previously thought.

'Nothing like it has been found in this country from the 5th or 6th century.'

The ring was found by metal detectorist Michael Greenhorn, from York and District Metal Detecting Club, in 2009 as he searched a field near the village of Escrick, south of York.

Ancient: The ring is now believed to have belonged to royalty in the 5th and 6th centuries

It measures around 2.5cm across and is intricately made of gold, prestige glass and a large sapphire.

The initial assessment of its origin was that it was likely to be Anglo-Saxon or Viking, from the 10th or 11th century.

5th Century England was a tumultuous period with invasions from across Europe making it likely that the ring came from the continent. 

Experts believe it may have then been given to someone from the ruling classes in England at some point in the 5th Century, probably in the early Anglo-Saxon period.

The end of Roman rule in England in 410 was followed by invasions from the Celts, Scots, Saxons, Picts and further Roman uprisings.

The failing economy of the country led to civil war, widespread famine and changes in leadership across the century.

Corrupt leadership, more civil turmoil, public forgetfulness and individual apathy following the Battle at Badon, circa 500AD, meant that England was ripe for the Saxon picking.

The Anglo-Saxon rule of Briton lasted for a further 500 years until the Norman Conquest in 1066.

Now the expert group has dated it to a much earlier period.

They have also suggested the ring was made in Europe, possibly France, and that it would have belonged to a king, leader or consort - not a bishop which was a previous theory.

The wear on the ring also suggests that it could have been a brooch first, which was later made into a ring.

'It has been fantastic to hear the thoughts of some of the world's leading experts and their suggestions will allow us to now go away and try and fit the ring into a historical timeframe,' Miss McCaul said.

'The general thought was that it was probably made on the continent and perhaps traded or gifted it to somebody in the ruling classes in England. It was probably around the start of the Anglo-Saxon period.

'Hopefully this will lead us to finding out more about the ring and possibly even who might have owned it.'

The workshop was attended by more than 30 experts from across the UK and included a day of talks, presentations and discussion, the museum said.

The expert group concluded the sapphire in the ring was probably cut earlier, possibly during the Roman period, but the ring itself was specially made around the sapphire.

And, by looking at the wear on the ring they decided it was worn for at least 50 years before it was lost.

The
gold hoop that forms the ring also looks slightly different to the main
part of the ring, with suggestions being made that it was turned into a
ring later, possibly from a brooch or mount.

A
museum spokesman said another theory suggested during the meeting was 
that the ring was from a later period, perhaps the 8th or 9th centuries,
but was inspired by earlier styles in both jewellery and perhaps 
surviving stonework in Yorkshire dating from the 5th or 6th centuries.

Research: The Yorkshire Museum have raised £35,000 to buy the ring and conduct more studies

He said further research was underway, in particular a search for any further archaeology or historical information which can link the ring to 5th or 6th centuries.

This will be conducted initially by researchers from the University of Durham.

The Yorkshire Museum has raised £35,000 to buy the ring.

This has been made possible with grants of £10,000 from the Art Fund, £10,000 from the MLA/V&A Purchase Grant Fund, £10,000 from the Headley Trust and £1,000 from the York Philosophical Society.
