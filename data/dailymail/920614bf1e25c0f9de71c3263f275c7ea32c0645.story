A four-year-old boy had to have his ear sewn back on after being attacked by a dog that he had dangled food in front of.

David House was bitten by a Japanese Akita at a home in Litherland, Merseyside, last week and was left with cuts to his ear, face and the top of his head. The bites to his head were so deep the dogs teeth reached his skull.

David, who was visiting Liverpool from Kent with his family, was taken to Alder Hey Hospital where he was treated for two days.

His father, David House, said his son's ear was 'still a bit wonky' and he will visit plastic surgeons again this week to see if he needs further treatment.

Mr House said his son was 'coping fine', despite the extent of his injuries.

He said: 'He had stitches to his face and head.

'On the top of his head the bite had gone right down to the bone and he had to have stitches to three layers of skin.

'He is on heavy painkillers but he is absolutely fine, although he will be scarred on the top of his head.'

Merseyside police have warned the dog's owner not to leave it unsupervised around children again, but the animal has not been destroyed.

Police said the dog is believed to have 'jumped up at the boy after he dangled food in front of it'.

A police spokesman said an adult intervened as soon as the attack happened, and the dog was put outside and an ambulance was called.

Mr House said his son was used to dogs, as they have two at home, 'so he's not timid or scared like some children'.

He didn't think the dog that attacked his son was used to children, and said the attack should serve as a warning to other pet owners.

Mr House said: 'We want to warn people to beware of having dogs around children when they are not used to them.'
