Gardeners are being forced to burn their own lawns in a bid to get rid of an infestation of 'toxic' caterpillars causing severe allergic reactions.

Thousands of brown-tailed moth caterpillars are said to have descended on a railway embankment near a residential road in Alphington, Exeter, Devon.

Some have suffered rashes and other allergic reactions to the small creatures, and have had to take drastic action to keep them out of their gardens.

Drastic measures: Jay Taylor, from Alphington, Exeter, had to burn down large parts of his back garden to keep the brown-tailed moth caterpillars at bay

Threat: The brown-tailed moth caterpillars are covered in small hairs which can cause allergic reactions, skin irritations, headaches and breathing problems

The brown-tailed moth caterpillar is said to be native to the UK, but is found in larger numbers at this time of year

The insects are covered in small hairs which can break off easily in a light breeze and cause an allergic reaction, rashes and, in severe cases, asthma attacks.

Residents have since taken the severe course of burning their own trees and gardens in an attempt to deprive the caterpillars of food and keep them away.

Jay Taylor, a resident of Willeys Avenue, in Alphington, Exeter, Devon, said thousands of the brown-tailed moth caterpillars can be found along the railway embankment running behind Alphington Road.

He said: 'I have welts all down my arms and legs - it looks as though I have got chicken pox.'

Infested: The small insects have taken over a railway embankment in Alphington, Exeter, leading some people to suffer allergic reactions which put them in hospital

Experts have said they are seeing more and more of the small pests in Britain, particularly in the south of England

'These caterpillars are everywhere, they seem to be on everything.

'One neighbour shook a bush in his garden and about 500 dropped out - it really is no joking matter.

'I have a baby daughter and I am worried for her so our garden, which was full of flowers, is now just mud as I have burnt every tree, plant and shrub so the caterpillars have nothing to eat.'

Last year an infestation made life misery for residents living alongside the railway embankment in nearby St Thomas.

The infestations are not just confined to Devon, as millions of the larvae of the have again started emerging to festoon the branches of trees and shrubs in New Addington, near Croydon, Surrey

The invasion in Surrey comes a year after a similar plague saw two people end up needing emergency treatment in hospital and several more suffering from breathing difficulties.

Woodland information website woodlands.co.uk states that brown-tailed moth caterpillars, which are native to the UK, are normally found on hedgerow trees such as blackthorn and hawthorn and scrubby plants.

Severe measures: Jay Taylor, pictured with his partner Helen and daughter Olivia, burned down parts of his garden after becoming worried about the caterpillars' effect on his family

Harmful: A resident in Alphington, who did not want to be named, shows off the extensive rash on their arm which they say was caused by a brown-tailed moth caterpillar

The site says that local councils have addressed the problem of brown tail moth infestations by using pheromone traps. The traps release a ‘scent’ that attracts males, and therefore interferes with the normal breeding cycle.

Network Rail has written to residents saying that the vegetation along the bank will be sprayed and removed but Mr Taylor believes that the only way to deal with the infestation is with fire.

He said: 'The only way to get rid of them is to burn what they are on.'

Mr Taylor added: 'I saw one chap who had a caterpillar land on his neck.

'He ended up in hospital because his neck swelled up.'

Local authorities have warned that the brown-tailed moth can hide in winter months in silkens tents which can hold up to 2,000 of the creatures.

Network Rail has advised residents to stay away from the embankment while the spraying and removal is undertaken and apologised for any inconvenience.

A spokesman for the city council said: 'Over the last few years brown tail moth infestations have increased, especially in the southern parts of the UK.

'I understand Network Rail has carried out two treatments in recent weeks along the embankment and intends to carry out further treatment if necessary.'
