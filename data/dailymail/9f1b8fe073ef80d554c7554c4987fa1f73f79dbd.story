Record producer Nigel Wright's six-bedroom mansion near the Surrey commuter town of Chertsey may seem a million miles from the frantic world of pop superstardom. 

But the recording studio in the garden is where Nigel worked on hits for the biggest names in the music business, including Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Cliff Richard and Jose Carreras.

Perhaps most exciting of all for the producer's four daughters, however, was when they came home from school one day and heart-throbs Take That were frolicking in the pool.

'They were over the moon,' says Nigel, who produced the band's first hit single It Only Takes A Minute in 1992 and several of the tracks on their second album, Everything Changes, released the following year.

'We had no idea just how big they were. They were just a bunch of kids. We took them to the local pub for lunch and word spread like wildfire. Next thing we knew, we had fans camping outside the house and my wife even found girls in the kitchen who had snuck into the house when we weren't looking.'

Now that Nigel's daughters have grown up and flown the nest, he and wife Deana, a nurse, are looking for a smaller property near the coast. They have put their home of 34 years on the market for £1.59million.

'This has been a great family house – when our children were young and went to school nearby, we had loads of friends here and it felt more of a community, but as the years have gone by, everyone has moved away,' says Nigel. 'It's no longer the centre of the family.'

Its location, on St Ann's Hill, has been home to other music industry stars, including Keith Moon of The Who and Vince Clarke of Erasure, who finally sold Ammonite, his custom-made, snail-shaped home, two years ago after several years on the market.

Oliver Clarke, of Barton Wyatt estate agents, believes it's more likely that a large family rather than a pop star will buy Nigel's house.

'Buyers who have been priced out of London realise they can get much more for their money here but still be in town in 45 minutes on the train or M25,' he says.

Nigel bought the house when he was 26 in 1981 while he was working at nearby Shepperton Studios. Born and brought up in Bristol, he performed in bands from the age of 15. He moved to London at 19 and in 1980 was one of the founding members of the jazz-funk band Shakatak.

'We'd just had a hit album and suddenly I could afford a house,' says Nigel, 60, who was renting in nearby Laleham at the time. 'I thought, rather than paying to use a studio, I might as well build my own.' So the house comes with its own recording studio.

The property's 2.2 acres, cluttered with outbuildings, were ripe for redevelopment when Nigel bought it from an elderly widow for £123,500. At the time it was half its current size. The former owners were from Scotland and named the house Lockerbie because of their connection with the Scottish town – years before the air disaster there.

Price: £1.59million

Location: Chertsey, Surrey

Bedrooms: Six

Unique features: Recording studio, pool that chart-toppers Take That went swimming in

'It's been a non-stop spend, really – we've been adding a bit here and a bit there and refurbished the studio three times over the years,' says Nigel, who has been Andrew Lloyd Webber's music producer for nearly three decades, collaborating with him on his musicals as well as TV shows including How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?

The Wrights built the swimming pool and pool-house as well as increasing the number of bedrooms from three to six.

'What we love about the house is the high ceilings and windows which flood it with light,' says Nigel, whose love of music began when he asked his parents if he could take up the trombone at the age of nine after hearing a brass band play on a visit to church with his father. 'I loved it and found it really easy,' he explains.

The couple are also selling a five-bedroom holiday home in Majorca's Valldemossa, which they use less now their daughters are older. They hope to put the proceeds from both sales towards a barn conversion with equally high ceilings but less living space.
