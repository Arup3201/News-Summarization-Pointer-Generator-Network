Salt: Game meatballs served at one of Jamie Oliver's restaurants contained almost one and a half times the maximum recommended daily amount of salt for an adult, researchers claim

Celebrity chefs have been accused of giving diners too much salt at their restaurant chains.

Research by health campaigners found high salt levels in dishes served in the restaurants of chefs Gordon Ramsay, Marco Pierre White, Jamie Oliver and Raymond Blanc.

The game meatballs served at one of Jamie Oliver’s restaurants contained nearly one and a half times the maximum amount of salt an adult is recommended to eat in a day, according to the study.

The dish made with British pork and wild boar served at his chain Jamie’s Italian contained the equivalent to more than 20 bags of ready-salted crisps.

But the study published by Consensus Action on Salt and Health (Cash) noted that salt levels could vary according to the chef on duty and praised Mr Oliver for his work reducing salt in meals. Jamie’s Italian also raised concerns about the reliability of the survey based on the limited sample size.

At Gordon Ramsay’s restaurant, The Savoy Grill, his steamed mussels with cider cream sauce and fries contained 7.3grams of salt, more than a gram more than the recommended daily allowance (6g).

Chain: On average Jamie's Italian had the highest level of salt in the three meals analysed as part of the survey

Cash found that out of 18 main meals surveyed at celebrity chef restaurants, nine contained more than 2.4g of salt per portion and would be labelled with a red traffic light if they had been on sale in a supermarket.

A selection of three main meals were analysed for their salt content at six celebrity chef restaurants: Brasserie Blanc by Raymond Blanc, Dinner by Heston Blumenthal, Frankie's by Marco Pierre White, Jamie’s Italian by Jamie Oliver, Fifteen by Jamie Oliver, and the Savoy Grill by Gordon Ramsay.

On average Jamie’s Italian had the highest level of salt in their three dishes tested, whilst Heston’s Dinner was shown to have the lowest values of salt.

Government watchdog the Food Standards Agency claims the nation is consuming far too much salt, leading to an epidemic of high blood pressure and strokes.

Graham MacGregor, Professor of Cardiovascular Medicine at The Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, Queen Mary University and chairman of Cash, said: ‘It’s a national scandal that there is still so much salt in our food.

‘Salt puts up our blood pressure, and as a result, thousands of people die unnecessarily each year from strokes, heart attacks and heart failure.

‘Whilst efforts have been made by foods in supermarkets to use less salt, chefs’ preference for saltier foods is preventing further progress.

‘It’s clear from our survey that some chefs are not listening to their customers. These chefs need to get their act together and stop shovelling salt in our food.’

Tests: Health campaigners highlighted the salt content in the smoked haddock and saffron risotto at Brasserie Blanc

Jamie’s Italian has categorically denied the findings of the study. The chain regularly carries out its own testing of the salt content of its meals and claims that the figure in the study for its meatball was unusually high.

In the study, one sample was taken of three of the dishes at each of the celebrity chefs’ restaurants and the research noted that there ‘is huge variation in restaurant cooking practices of different chefs’.

The study’s authors added: ‘Jamie’s Italian is in fact doing more to reduce salt in its meals than most other restaurants... we applaud Jamie’s commitment to reducing salt content and for signing up to the Department of Health’s Responsibility Deal Salt Catering Pledge, the first celebrity chef to do so.’
