The Dove ad campaign that shows women being sketched by a forensic artist has racked up over 18 million YouTube views so far. Now a spoof video by New Feelings Time with the tagline 'Men: You're Less Beautiful Than You Think' is also becoming an Internet sensation.

Dove's Real Beauty Sketches
campaign hired an FBI forensic artist to sketch women based on their 
own descriptions of themselves - without ever seeing them - then create a
second drawing based on stranger's description.

While the women in the original video focused on their flaws when describing themselves to the sketch artist, the men view themselves as movie star handsome.

Spoof sketches: The men re-enacted the Dove ad almost frame-by-frame, but had a much better opinion of their looks than the women in the original video

Reaction shot: One man was shocked after he described himself as George Clooney (left) while the women interviewed had a very different take (right)

 One man says he's a 'white Denzel Washington', while the woman's description of him said he 'looked like a lawn gnome'.

The spoof video re-creates the original 
almost frame-by-frame, using a bearded 'forensic artist', a very similar
loft studio and even the same music. Like the women, the men explain 
that they showed up in a strange location and a man started drawing 
them.

Self confident: The men focused on their positive features, while the women they were told to get close to seemed to see many more flaws

Once the portraits were hung side-by-side, the women in the original ad were shocked to see that the sketches created on the stranger's description of them were much more attractive.

For the men, it was exactly the opposite. They see the positives like 'beautiful teeth'.

'People
say that they're an abyss because they just don't end,' one man says of his eyes, while another believes that 'the older I've gotten the more 
stunning I've gotten.' 

Spot the difference: One man (left) is 
shocked when he sees the difference in his description (center) of 
himself and a stranger's view (right)

Asked to name his 'most prominent feature', yet another man proudly lists 'my bulge'.  

The men were told to chat with female strangers - who had a very different view.

'Overall I would say that he really looked like lawn gnome,' one woman said, while another admitted 'he looked like he smelled really bad, and he did.' 

The men loved their eyes, but the women were less complimentary.

One said 'his eyes kind of bugged out when he talked,' another called the guy's eyes 'rapey' and a third explained 'I can't remember if he had eyebrows.'

To sum up, the final female questioned 
compared her match to a Lord of the Rings character, saying he looked 
like he walked 'fresh out of Mordor'. 

During the portrait reveal, the women in the original ad were shocked to discover how much more beautiful they appeared to strangers - one even teared up in happiness.

The men were crying for different reasons. After being shown a side-by-side of his Edward Norton-look-alike with a bloated, nerdy profile, one man said 'he looks like a movie star, and the other one looks like he'll probably die soon.'

'I didn't realize that two opinions could be so vastly different,' said a guy who described himself as Brad Pitt, after discovering that the girls saw the Unibomber.

 'That is not me,' said the man at the end, 'and I refuse to believe it.'
