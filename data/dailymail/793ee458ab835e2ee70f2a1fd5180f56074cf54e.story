A 2-year-old English mastiff whose heroism likely saved a family's 9-month-daughter is now fighting for his own life.

Duke, who woke up his owner Lucia Piscoglio when her baby Ava Jane appeared to be suffocating in her crib, had a massive allergic reaction to a Lyme disease vaccine just days later.

Now, as the hulking pooch fights to stay alive, his heartwarming bond with little Ava has helped bring a flood of well-wishes and even monetary donations to the Piscoglio's from across the internet and even the globe.

Adorable: A 2-year-old English mastiff named Duke helped save his 9-month-old best friend Ava Jane Piscoglio when she appeared to be suffocating in her crib

'When my daughter was born he became her best friend and protector,' said mother Lucia Piscoglio

The positive vibes first came courtesy of other mastiff lovers after Piscoglio, of Swedesboro, posted her story to a Facebook group dedicated to the breed called Mastiffs Rule Drool is Cool.

'Throughout my pregnancy he was with me everyday,' Piscoglio writes. 'Once Ava Jane was born he immediately became her best friend.'

Around Ava's 9-month birthday, Duke ran into Piscoglio's room barking.

'I looked into the monitor and saw Ava's face deep into the bumper pad. As Duke and I ran to her side I didn't feel her inhale or exhale,' the mother writes.

Thanks to quick thinking on the part of both mother and dog, Ava was soon breathing normally.

Unfortunately for the hero Duke, he would soon be the one in need of a hero after a severe allergic reaction that, at least at first, appeared to come out of nowhere.

Piscoglio writes:  

'He became so ill we rushed him back to the vet, he was swollen all over, not eating, not drinking, not going to the bathroom or even moving After two nights in the hospital with tons of test being ran he began to turn around slowly.

'He is now home with his family with a steroid pill, antibiotic, Benadryl twice a day and Pepcid. He also will have a strict diet.

'The final diagnosis is that he had one of the worse allergic reactions they have ever seen due to a Lyme Vaccine.'

Piscoglio's emotional tale elicited thousands of likes and comments on the original post and subsequently at another Facebook page started by Piscoglio called Duke & Vaccination Awareness.

'Ask questions because we almost lost Duke to something preventable,' Piscoglio writes. 'I am not against vaccines but please educate yourselves on the risk!'

The family has also received monetary support thanks to a GoFundMe page dedicated to Duke.

In three days, just 54 people have helped to raise aruond $1,500 for the dog.

'The final diagnosis is that he had one of the worse allergic reactions they have ever seen due to a Lyme Vaccinem,' writes Piscoglio. Duke is now on a regimen of several drugs and a strict diet after the reaction left him horrible swollen
