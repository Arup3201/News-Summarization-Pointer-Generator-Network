Manchester United fans hoping for a return to free-flowing attacking football under new manager Louis van Gaal might have felt a little uneasy at the sight of the Dutch coach playing with a back SIX at times against Argentina.

The threat of Lionel Messi was clearly at the forefront of Van Gaal’s plans for the World Cup semi-final showdown in the Corinthians Arena.

Van Gaal’s tactics worked to a degree as Holland shut out the Argentina attack in a largely uninspiring semi-final but the Dutch side lost out in a penalty shoot-out.

But United fans, who were fed a constant diet of entertaining football under Sir Alex Ferguson, will be hoping the new boss doesn’t resort to negative tactics at Old Trafford.
