A woman has claimed a police officer tasered her because she refused to show him her breasts. 

The officer chased the woman through her work before shooting her with the gun, a Federal Court heard. 

Ashlea Bennett is now suing the City of Haskell, in Arkansas, and its police officer Brandon Carter.

A woman has claimed that a police officer tasered her because she refused to show him her breasts

In a court file, it claims that Carter 'demanded that she expose her breasts to him' while he was on duty and wearing his uniform on December 13, 2011. 

'Carter's demands to the plaintiff to expose herself to him occurred multiple times.

'That, upon her refusal, Carter drew his City of Haskell-issued electroshock Taser weapon from his utility belt, pointed the weapon at plaintiff, and threatened to deploy the same against her if she would not expose her breasts to him.

'That, upon seeing the threat of unlawful force, the plaintiff took physical flight and ran from Carter.'

The police officer is then accused of chasing the Ms Bennett before stunning her with the taser gun a number of times. 

According to Ms Bennett this was not the first time the office had made 'inappropriate sexual comments' to her and had even 'demanded that she expose herself to him'. 

She believes the City of Haskell's police department ignored her previous complaints about Carter.

The woman is now seeking compensation and punitive damages over the incident which include civil rights violations, assault, failure to train and supervise and negligent supervision.
