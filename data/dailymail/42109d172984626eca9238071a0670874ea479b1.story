'Attacked': V. Stiviano (pictured on her way to New York City from LAX on Saturday) has reported an alleged assault by two men outside a New York City hotel

A man has handed himself in in connection to the allegedly racist attack on V.Stiviano outside a top New York hotel.

The 40-year-old Long Island man handed himself in on Tuesday, CNN reported. 

V. Stiviano reported the alleged assault by two men outside the fashionable Gansevoort hotel in New York on Monday.

Stiviano said the row began in nearby Revel restaurant where a group of diners criticized her and she argued back.

According to CNN, a man then tried to take a cell phone photograph of her when she knocked the phone out of his hands and left.

Stiviano's attorneys Alaleh Kamran and Mac Nehoray say their client was getting into a cab around the corner - outside the hotel - when they were followed by the men and a female companion and the attack took place.

One of the men allegedly spat at Stiviano while the other continued the verbal abuse which escalated into both Stiviano and the men shoving each other.

Both men then allegedly threw punches at her.

'Ms. V. Stiviano was attacked outside of Gansevoort Hotel by two white males,' a statement released by the law firm said.   

'As Ms. Stiviano was getting inside a cab, one of the assailants punched her in the face, calling her a f**** n**** bitch. Moments later, Ms. Stiviano was punched again by the same person while he was yelling 'I am going to slaughter you'. As the assault on Ms. Stiviano continued, some by-standers attacked the assailant. 

'Ms. Stiviano was rushed away from the scene and was seen by a private physician upon her return to the hotel. She is badly bruised and swollen on the right side of her face and has some difficulty with her speech.' 

The men were in the city celebrating the 40th birthday of the man who's now in custody.

Two passersby broke up the fight and one of the men fell to the floor. Hotel security called the police, they are still seeking one of the men involved in the fight.

Stiviano was in New York to appear on Anderson Cooper's CNN show.

NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton had yesterday said his officers had not received any reports of an alleged attack against Stiviano.

Because Stiviano and her lawyer Mac Nehoray had not filed a police report, officers had not been investigating the fight.

Reported: Stiviano spoke to detectives on Monday and told them the assault happened outside the Gansevoort Hotel in Manhattan's Meatpacking District on Sunday night

'Punched': Stiviano, who recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball, was allegedly attacked

But police have now said Stiviano has spoken to detectives to tell them about the assault.

Her attorneys said they are examining surveillance video of the alleged attack.

'We understand that there are now two videos of the assault that have been located,' her lawyer's office said in a statement.

'In
 addition, several witnesses have come forward with relevant and 
critical information regarding the facts surrounding the incident and 
the identity of the assailants.'

Stiviano recorded the racist rant that was leaked and led to Sterling's ejection from professional basketball.

He then handed control of team to his 
wife Shelly before a $2 billion deal to sell the franchise was agreed 
with former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.

It
 came just days before an NBA panel was due to meet to discuss revoking 
Sterling's ownership over the team in light of the racism scandal last 
month.

However the deal has yet to go through as it has to be approved by the NBA and Sterling is believed to be fighting it.

Sterling had bought the Clippers for $12.5 million in 1981.
