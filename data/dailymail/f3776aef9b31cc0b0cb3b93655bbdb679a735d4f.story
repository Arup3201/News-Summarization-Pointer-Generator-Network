On Friday he won a landslide victory in Bradford West. But by the next morning, George Galloway was crowing about his ‘Blackburn triumph’.

So excited was the MP about his return to government it seems he may have suffered a brief memory lapse – confusing the city where he had been canvasing for months with another 40 miles away.

The Respect MP tweeted: ‘Welcome to the 6000 new followers. I will try to live up to your expectations. Shattered but happy after the Blackburn triumph.’

Oops!: George Galloway tweets about his triumph in Blackburn - a town 40 miles away from Bradford where he has just been elected

The blunder could stoke accusations of carpetbagging by the MP, who boasted
 throughout his campaign of his deep understanding of the constituency –
 and yet a day later seemed to have forgotten its name.*

Mr Galloway quickly corrected himself, tweeting minutes later ‘Bradford is home for me now’.

He then suggested to his Twitter followers that his account had been hacked, tweeting, ‘Nice try. Password now changed’.

Later
 in the day he removed the embarrassing tweet and added: ‘The tweet you 
received re Blackburn was a hoax. However we're certainly intending to 
come to Blackburn!’

However the damage was already done and the politician faced a barrage of ridicule on Twitter over the blunder.

Confused?: George Galloway after his election victory in Bradford West... not Blackburn

Labour MP Denis MacShane tweeted: ‘Galloway has tweeted he won big in Blackburn. Tip to Labour. Wait 6 months. Cover Bradford with posters ‘Where's George?’

Tony Cross pitied the MP, adding: ‘Galloway doesn't even know which city his in. Wow, he must be tired. Blackburn/Bradford...its all the same to George’.

Tom McLaughlin tweeted simply: ‘Wrong town, you muppet’.

Mr Galloway, expelled by Labour in 2003, said it was the ‘most sensational victory’ in by-election history. He received 18,341 votes – a 56 per cent share. He said his victory represented a ‘total rejection’ of the major parties.

He had relentlessly courted the votes of young Muslims and grandiloquently branded his win the ‘Bradford Spring’ – an echo of the uprisings in the Arab world.

Bradford West is now the fourth constituency to have Mr Galloway for its MP.

* = Carpet-bagging is when an outsider moves into an area to take advantage of a situation they believe they could benefit from. It is sometimes used to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where he or she does not have deep community ties.
