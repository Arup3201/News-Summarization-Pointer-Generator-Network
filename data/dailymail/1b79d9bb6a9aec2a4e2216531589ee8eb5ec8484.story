There was double humiliation at Penn State's final football game of the season, after one student dressed up as anti-paedophile mascot 'Paedobear' to protest at the sex scandal cover up at the college.

The unknown fan dressed in the provocative outfit during Penn State's 30-14 defeat in the Ticketcity Bowl in Dallas, Texas, and carried a sign that read: 'Keep quiet and don't tell anyone.'

The game between the Nittany Lions and Houston Cougars at the Cotton Bowl stadium was taking place without Penn State's long-serving coach, Joe Paterno, who was sacked in November over the Jerry Sandusky sex scandal.

Scandal: Jerry Sandusky denies more than 50 charges of alleged abuse of young boys. Right, Penn State head coach Joe Paterno was sacked after it emerged he had failed to act on warnings about possible abuse

Charges: Last month Sandusky, pictured with wife Dottie, waived his right to a preliminary hearing

Sandusky, assistant coach to Paterno 
for 30 years, faces more than 50 child sex-abuse charges over decades of
alleged abuse of young boys.

Wearing
the costume was apparently the idea of a University of Texas fan, 
furious at the apparent cover up of Sandusky's alleged abuse.

A
user on the university's sports message board, Ghost of LL, wrote: 'The
conspiracy undertaken by the staff and administrators of the 
Pennsylvania State University to cover up the rape of children so as not
to damage its precious football program is shameful.

'For
a decade, Penn State employees, agents, trustees and officers - from 
the janitor to the president of the university all the way up to the 
Lord High Football Coach - knew that Jerry Sandusky was raping children,
and doing so on Penn State property.'

Message: The fan was wearing a bear suit in reference to this internet meme - 'paedobear'. Originally it was used to signify illegal pornography, but is now used to signify paedophilia

Sandusky has said he is innocent of 
more than 50 charges stemming from alleged sexual assaults over 15 years
on 10 boys at his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere.

The scandal prompted the sacking of Hall of Fame football coach Paterno and the school's long-time president, Graham Spanier.

Former athletic director Tim Curley and vice president Gary Schultz also face charges of perjury and failure to report a crime.

The appearance of the 'Paedobear' is the latest blow to the college since the scandal erupted last year.

Last
month, Sandusky waived his right to a preliminary hearing just before 
the first witness was due to testify against him in a Pennsylvania 
courtroom.

The 67-year-old said: 'We fully intend to put together the best possible defence and stay the course for four full quarters.'

His attorney, Joe Amendola, then told reporters if they believed claims against his client they should call 1-800-REALITY - the number of a gay-sex phone service.

And another of his lawyers, Karl Rominger, claimed he had showered with boys from his Second Mile charity to 'teach them basic hygiene skills'.

The image of the 'Paedobear' is apparently used as a signal in online message boards that illegal pornographic images have been posted, although not necessarily paedophilia.

It has since been used to indicate the existence of child pornography or to mock paedophiles and draw attention to their actions.
