A Conservative school board made the controversial decision to remove information about contraception from a biology book because it flouts state law. 

Members of the Gilbert Public Schools board, in Arizona voted 3-2 on Tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections’ which dealt with contraception.

The school board argued that the information in the book went against a law which states that students should be given 'facts about childbirth or adoption over abortion.'

Controversial: Members of the Gilbert Public Schools board, voted 3-2 on Tuesday night to take out two pages from ‘Campbell Biology: Concepts and Connections’ book, pictured here, 

The board covers at least 38 schools and 39,000 students mostly in Chandler and Mesa, in Arizona.

Board member Julie Smith told 12 News in Phoenix: ‘By redacting, we are not censoring.’ 

‘This school district does offer sexual education classes. If we were censoring, we would not offer anything on this topic whatsoever.’ 

The biology textbook   describes, among other topics, contraception techniques, including explanations of how the morning-after pill works.

And it was this mention of the morning-after pill being able to induce an abortion that led Scottsdale-based legal group, Alliance Defending Freedom, to write to the Gilbert Public Schools superintendent in August.

It said that a parent had raised concerns that the text was not compliant with state legislation.

The textbook was also criticized for going against the beliefs of some conservative Christians who believe that life begins at the moment of conception.

However, the book also points out that abstinence is the only fail-safe birth control method.

Reed Carr, another board member voted to remove the pages that did not comply with the law

In 2012, Republican Governor Jan Brewer signed the law which states ‘the state has a strong interest in promoting childbirth and adoption over elective abortion,’ in school programs. 

But the alliance said the materials, which have been used in the district since 2006, present elective abortions as a viable option for students while making no mention of childbirth or adoption.

However, an official from the state’s Department of Education said in an email to Gilbert Public Schools last month that the book did not appear on its face to violate the law.

Yet they agreed that it was important for locally elected school boards to choose texts they prefer when it comes to a topic such as sex education, ‘where the values of parents are heavily involved.’

There have been a series of debates recently over the best way to teach U.S. teens about sexual health and reproduction in public schools. 

Last month in Colorado a fight over the content of an advanced history course took center stage as the school curriculum came under scrutiny.
