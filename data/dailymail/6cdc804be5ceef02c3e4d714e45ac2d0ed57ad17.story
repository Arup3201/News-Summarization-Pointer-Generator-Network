Ronald Koeman has succeeded in persuading wantaway defender Dejan Lovren to return to Southampton amid fears he would refuse.

Lovren was given extra time off after playing in the World Cup with Croatia but joined the rest of his team-mates as they flew to Belgium for a pre-season training camp on Sunday afternoon.

He was left furious with Southampton for rejecting a £20million bid from Liverpool and there were worries that he would stay away to force through a move. The 25-year-old handed in a transfer request in May.

Koeman is intent on keeping hold of Lovren after already losing star players following Luke Shaw’s transfer to Manchester United and Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert’s switch to Liverpool.

Lovren made no secret of his desire to leave saying his ‘head is already at Liverpool’

He added: ‘Liverpool sent the offer and the club haven't informed me. Not even about the subsequent Liverpool bids. That wasn't right. I found out about the bid from other people which disappointed me and I realised I've got no business staying at Southampton.

‘Liverpool sent a £20m and they [Southampton] paid £9m for me, so they would've earned twice the amount.

‘At this point, I don't know what I'll do and I don't like it. It was unbelievable that a few days ago I had an offer of £20 million. It was in the morning and by the afternoon the club had said I was not for sale.’

But Koeman spoke to Lovren twice and he has joined the rest of the squad as they fly out for a five-day training camp.

Koeman has already brought in midfielder Dusan Tadic and striker Graziano Pelle and is keen not to lose any more of his key players.

The squad will be based just outside Genk during their stay in Belgium, with games against EHC Hoensbroek in Holland on Tuesday and KSK Hasselt on Thursday to look forward to.

Jay Rodriguez, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament against Manchester City in early April, joined the rest of the squad as he steps up his recovery ahead of the new season.

The former Burnley forward was forced to miss England's World Cup campaign but it is hoped he will be back in action by October.

New signing Tadic didn't fly with Koeman's squad, although he will link up with his new team-mates at their hotel ahead of Saints' first pre-season friendlies.

Pelle, who only completed his £8million move from Feyenoord on Saturday, is set to join the 26-man travelling party over the next few days.
