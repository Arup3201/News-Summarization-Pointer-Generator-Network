Hundreds of anti-Israeli demonstrators brought traffic to a standstill in London today after turning out in their droves to call for an end to military strikes on Gaza.

Protesters crowded the streets outside the Israeli Embassy in Kensington High Street, west London, and some took it even further by standing on one of the city’s iconic double-decker buses.

Waving placards which read ‘Gaza: End the Siege’ and ‘Freedom for Palestine’, demonstrators chanted and blocked the road as they protested against ‘Israeli aggression’ in the Middle East.

At least 17 people climbed on top of a London bus during the protest, with one holding a banner which read: ‘Judaism rejects the Zionist state and condemns its criminal siege and occupation’.

Others lined the main road in Kensington High Street, preventing any vehicles from using the road for a short period.

However, despite the traffic jams and large crowds, police said the protest was largely peaceful as a whole.

The demonstration came after the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which staged protests around the world today, called on people to ‘oppose Israeli aggression’.

In a statement earlier this week, the group said: ‘This isn’t about rockets from Gaza. It’s about Israel fighting to maintain its control over Palestinian lives, and Palestinian land.

‘It’s about Israel feeling able to commit war crimes with complete impunity.’

Elsewhere today, some 3,000 protesters gathered in front of the Norwegian parliament in Oslo to call for an end to the violence, and 100 people demonstrated near the French Foreign Ministry in Paris. Others also gathered in Tunisia to voice their concern.

Demonstrators waved Palestinian flags and one woman, who had the painted on her cheeks, shouted ‘Palestine will survive’.

Stephane Frappreau, who identified himself as Jewish, said the demonstrations were about ‘defending humanity and about stopping the massacre’.

‘I think that people tend to forget that Palestinians are people who are suffering, kids and women, who are dying every day,’ he said.

To date, at least 106 Palestinians - including dozens of civilians - have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday that he would press forward with his country's military offensive In the Gaza Strip. Pictured: The demonstration in west London this afternoon

‘And I think that people shouldn't 
confuse things or come to quick conclusions, because being against 
Israel as we are today is not about being anti-Semitic.’

A spokeswoman for Prime Minister David Cameron earlier said he supported Israel in the face of attacks by Hamas against Israeli civilians.

President Francois Hollande issued a statement earlier this week in support of Israel that prompted criticism because it failed to mention Palestinian victims.

He later spoke with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyau and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, before issuing new statements expressing support for each and concern for all victims.

He condemned violence and urged a return to peace talks.

Tensions had been rising between the two countries and Israel launched the offensive on Tuesday in response to weeks of heavy rocket fire out of Gaza.

To date, at least 106 Palestinians - including dozens of civilians - have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. Palestinian militants have fired more than 600 rockets at Israel.

One rocket fired from the Gaza Strip struck a gas station and set it ablaze in southern Israel, seriously wounding one man.

But there have been no deaths on the Israeli side, in large part because of a new rocket-defence system that has intercepted more than 100 incoming projectiles.
