Former footballers Jamie Redknapp, Gary Lineker and Ian Wright practiced their golf swings at an event held at Heathrow Airport in order to promote the Kate and Justin Rose Foundation.

English golfer Rose, who was part of the European team which defeated America at Gleneagles this weekend, has teamed up with British Airways to raise money for his Foundation. 

Rose and his wife Kate set up the Foundation in order to 'inspire children from he inside out: nutrition, education, and experiences.'

The duo have helped children in Orlando fight hunger, provided books to less fortunate kids and host two events a year to give children new life experiences.

The event saw Rose take a shot from the wing of a British Airways Boeing 747 at Heathrow Airport on Monday.

Match of the Day presenter  Lineker also attempted the shot from the wing of the plane while both Wright and Redknapp also took part in a plethora of challenges. 

Fashion model and English television personality Jodie Kidd also made an appearance.

Rose uploaded a selfie, taken by Redknapp, onto his Instagram with the message 'Morning British Airways engineering bay with friends Jamie Redknapp, Ian Wright, Jodie Kidd and Gary Lineker.'

Redknapp, Wright, Kidd and Lineker also took to social media to reveal to their followers that they were at the event for the Rose Foundation.
