His head shaved and his hands bound by shackles one of Colonel Gadhafi's seven son's was today extradited to Libya, where he is wanted on corruption charges.

Al-Saadi Gadhafi fled when his father's regime crumbled in 2011 and has been held under house arrest in Niger ever since.

Libya had been seeking the extradition of Saadi, Gadhafi's third son, who escaped following the NATO-backed uprising.

Shaved: Images released by the Libyan Prison Authority and circulated on line show a Libyan guard shaving the head of the former dictator's son

Shared: The Facebook page of the Tripoli Revolutionaries Brigade, a militia made up of former rebels, shared the images of al-Saadi having his head shaved

'The Libyan government received today Saadi Gadhafi and he arrived in Tripoli,' the cabinet of Prime Minister Ali Zeidan said in a statement. 

Al-Saadi, 41, and the former head of Libya's football federation, is being held by judiciary police forces, the government said.

It thanked Niger for its cooperation and said al-Saadi would be treated according to international justice standards for prisoners.

The authorities said al-Saadi - one of the deposed Libyan leader's eight children - will be treated 'in accordance with international law'.

A Libyan official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said al-Saadi arrived at Tripoli's airport in the early hours of today and was transferred to a prison in the capital.

The website of a government-backed militia showed what it said were pictures of al-Saadi wearing a blue prison uniform, calling him a criminal.

Libyan news websites also ran pictures showing guards shaving his head in prison.

Held: The son of Colonel Gadhafi was held under house arrest in Niger, after fleeing across the southern border to seek refuge

Captured: Al-Saadi's brother and son of Colonel Gadhafi, Seif al-Islam was captured by revolutionary fighters in Zintan, Libya. The International Criminal Court has called for the country's new leaders to hand him over to face trial at The Hague

Al-Saadi was known for his love of professional soccer and a playboy lifestyle.

His brief career in Italian football ended after a failed drug test. He headed Libya's Football Federation and was also the former head of the country's special forces.

Like most of Gadhafi loyalists and ex-regime officials, al-Saadi is wanted for his role in curbing protests against his father's rule and the killing of protesters.

But unlike his brother, Seif al-Islam, who was groomed to be Gadhafi's successor, al-Saadi is not sought by the International Criminal Court.

Seif al-Islam is held by a militia in the western Libyan town of Zintan, which refuses to hand him over to the central government for trial.

Al-Saadi joins Seif al-Islam as the only of Gadhafi's children currently in Libya.

At least three other Gadhafi's sons were killed during the uprising while the rest of the children sought asylum in neighboring Algeria, along with Gadhafi's wife and al-Saadi's mother, Safiya.

The mother, a sister and two brothers, were granted asylum in Oman in 2012 and moved there from Algeria.

Niger had previously refused to comply with Libyan requests for al-Saadi, saying that once he was back home, he might be killed.

There have been tensions between the two African nations and while Libya has criticised the presence of Gadhafi loyalists in Niger, the nation has expressed concern about 'the terrorist threat' posed by the lack of security in southern Libya, near its own border.

The elder Gadhafi ruled Libya with an eccentric brutality for nearly 42 years before he was ousted by an uprising in August 2011.

He was captured and killed in October, along with his son Muatassim.

Gadhafi's younger sons Seif al-Arab and Khamis were killed earlier in the civil war.

The rule of law is still weak in Libya after decades of Gadhafi's reign. Courts remain paralysed and security remains tenuous as unruly militias proliferate.

The state, however, relies heavily on the militias to serve as security forces since the police and military remain a shambles.

Successive governments have been too weak to either secure Seif al-Islam's imprisonment in the capital or put pressure on the Zintan militia to hand him over to the government.

The ICC has charged Seif al-Islam with murder and persecution of civilians during the early days of the Libyan uprising.

If convicted in that court, he would have faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, because it does not have the jurisdiction to employ the death penalty.

Last summer, the international court judges ruled that Libya cannot give Seif al-Islam a fair trial and asked authorities to hand him over to The Hague.

Last month Niger extradited a former high-ranking intelligence official who served under Gadhafi, and was 'plotting against the Libyan state'.

Government spokesman Morou Amadou said Abdallah Mansour was extradited in February.

He said the West African nation would not tolerate the 'destabilization of our neighbors from our territory'.

Dozens of Gadhafi loyalists fled to Niger in 2011 as the autocratic leader lost his hold on power prior to being captured and killed.

Al-Saadi Gadhafi is the former Libyan dictator's third son.

He headed up the country's football federation prior to the outbreak of civil war and was well-known for his sporting career.

He captained the Libyan national side and his club, Tripoli. The country's football association was run to favour the dictator's son.

President: Al-Saadi headed up the Libyan Footballing Federation, and captained the national team

One law dictated that only al-Saadi's name was to be announced, while other players were to have their numbers alone announced.

Referees favoured al-Saadi's side and the country's security forces were employed to silence protests in the crowds.

He signed for Italian Serie A team Perugia in 2003, and employed Argentinian football legend Diego Maradona as his technical consultant.

He made one appearance for the side before failing a drugs test.

Gadhafi joined UEFA Champions League Italian qualifiers Udinese Calcio during the 2005-06 season, playing just 10 minutes of one match.

The following season he transferred to rival Italian side U.C. Sampdoria, but did not play for the club.

The 41-year-old is married to the daughter of a former Libyan military commander.

In 2009, a U.S. diplomatic bulletin made reference to al-Saadi's playboy lifestyle.

It labelled him the 'black sheep' of the family, and mentioned scuffles with police forces in Europe, 'abuse of drugs and alcohol, excessive partying' and affairs with men and women.

It has been suggested that his bisexuality prompted al-Saadi's arranged marriage to the commander's daughter.

Gay pornography was reportedly found among his possessions when his home was ransacked when Tripoli fell in 2011.
