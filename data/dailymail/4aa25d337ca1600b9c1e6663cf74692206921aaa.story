For a drama about the English aristocracy, it has gathered a surprising cult following in the US.

Which explains the fury of American Downton Abbey fans when they discovered they will continue to receive the period drama four months after us.

Despite pressure to show the hit show simultaneously on both sides of the Atlantic, the Public Broadcasting Service said it would keep the current delay in place.

Outrage: More devoted US viewers could turn to piracy to catch Downton four months early, critics warn

Some argued the wait will lead to increased levels of piracy, with fans streaming episodes illegally on the internet as soon as it has aired in the UK to avoid reading spoilers online.

In the past, programme makers have been powerless to stop key plotlines from leaking onto the internet before American audiences have had a chance to see them.

Even First Lady Michelle Obama has reportedly sought to get her hands on advance copies, asking ITV for season three on DVD ahead of its official release date because she was such a big fan of the show.

One frustrated US fan wrote on Twitter: ‘I hate the UK for making Downton Abbey premiere later in America, but I also love the UK for making the show.’

Another said: ‘I don’t understand the advantage to PBS of the delay, do you? Why not air in US and UK at the same time’

The fourth series of Downton, which had its UK premiere in September, only began in the US on January 5.

While viewers in this country already know how Lady Mary has coped in the aftermath of her husband’s tragic death, more than 10million US fans are currently tuning in every week to find out

However, PBS president Paula Kerger said he had no plans to screen Downton Abbey’s fifth season any earlier, saying it had found its home in the post-Christmas slot.

She said: ‘It would be very hard for me to imagine putting it anywhere else than where it has seemed to have found a very strong audience.’

PBS is experimenting with a shorter delay for BBC hit Sherlock.

The latest series aired on the network shortly after it was screened in the UK on New Year’s Day.

But the crime drama’s co-creator Steven Moffat said any delay is too long, adding: ‘We can’t expect a show to go out in one country and expect people in another country to wait more than a day.

'The world has changed utterly.

Experiment: US viewers will get an early screening of Sherlock as the PBS trials a new shift pattern this year

'We’re going to be downloading all our television very, very soon, so the idea you have to wait is nonsense.’

PBS has also confirmed the date for the premiere of British sitcom Vicious, starring Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Derek Jacobi as a bickering gay couple.

It was announced last year that the US broadcaster would show the sitcom, and now PBS says it will air in June.
