A garter pistol which one of Britain’s most notorious gangsters used to hide in his sock has been put up for auction, along with the garters used to secure it.

Ronnie Kray’s 'mutt gun' - now safely decommissioned - will be auctioned in Northamptonshire next Tuesday.

Exactly what the ten cm-long pistol was used for is not known, but it was passed on to his second wife, Kate Howard, in 1987, shortly before she married the then-ageing (not to mention imprisoned) mobster.

This garter pistol belonged to notorious gangster, Ronnie Kray, and is up for sale at Towcester next week

These sock gaiters, or garters, which Ronnie Kray used to keep his socks up, are also included in the sale

Auctioneer Jonathan Humbert, who will sell the gun and garters in Towcester later this month, said: 'This really is the quintessential gangster’s item - and one with superb provenance and quite a history.'

Kate Kray, who received the items from an associate of her husband's, said: 'Charlie Clarke dropped off an enormous tea chest for me.

'It was full of Ron's stuff, from dinner suits and cufflinks to a bayonet and the gun, from before Ron went inside in 1968.'

She added: 'Charlie was known as the Catman, was murdered in Dover a month or so after giving me the tea chest.  I don't know why and I never asked.'

The gun, which has a walnut stock with nickel-plated barrel, is just one of 150 pieces of Kray memorabilia up for auction.

Thugs: The Krays, pictured at home in 1966 after being quizzed by police about the murder of George Cornell

Ronnie and his twin Reggie headed a criminal empire which ruled much of London with an iron fist during the 1950s and 60s.

In 1966 Ronnie shot George Cornell, an associate of rival London gang, the Richardsons, dead in the Blind Beggar pub in Whitechapel.  Cornell is said to have remarked 'Well, look who's here' just before he was shot.

But despite involvement in murders, armed robberies, racketeering and other crimes, the Krays became celebrities through their nightclub ownership and by mingling with some of the biggest stars of the day, including Dolly Parton and Frank Sinatra.

Justice finally caught up with them and they were sentenced to life in prison in 1968.  The judge, Mr Justice Melford Stevenson, told them: 'In my view, society has earned a rest from your activities.'

They were 
allowed out of prison for their mother's funeral in 1982, but Ronnie 
died in Broadmoor, aged 61 in 1995, and Reggie, died at 66, in 2000, a 
few weeks after being allowed out on compassionate leave.
