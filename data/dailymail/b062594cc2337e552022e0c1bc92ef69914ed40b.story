A CIA spokesman says a new intelligence assessment estimates that the Islamic State group can muster between 20,000 and 31,500 fighters across Iraq and Syria, up from a previous figure of 10,000.

The new assessment is based on a review of intelligence reports from May to August. It is larger than the 20,000 figure being used by many outside experts.

The CIA estimates that 2,000 of those fighters are from Western nations

'This new total reflects an increase in members because of stronger recruitment since June following battlefield successes and the declaration of a caliphate,' CIA spokesman Todd Ebitz said.

CIA spokesman Ryan Trapani says the new total reflects stronger recruitment by the extremist group since June following battlefield successes and the group's declaration of a caliphate.

He says the revised number also reflects 'greater battlefield activity, and additional intelligence.'

According to CNN, more than 15,000 fighters from 80 countries around the world, including 2,000 from Westerners, have gone to Syria to join the militants.

The revised figure comes a day after President Obama outlined his plans to 'dismantle and ultimately destroy' ISIS.

On Wednesday, Obama laid out plans to go after Islamic State militants with possible sustained airstrikes and associated military actions designed to neutralize the foe.

He insisted that despite ISIS declaring a caliphate, controlling large areas in Iraq and Syria and calling itself Islamic State, it is not a legitimate 'state.'

The president wants to train Syrian rebels to serve as ground troops against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.

However, after three years of civil war, there are many diverse groups fighting President Bashar al-Assad - and one other - ranging from moderates to extremists.

'There’s a lot of skepticism about this piece of the president’s strategy,' Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, a member of the House Intelligence Committee told The New York Times. 'The so-called moderate rebels have often been very immoderate and ineffective.'
