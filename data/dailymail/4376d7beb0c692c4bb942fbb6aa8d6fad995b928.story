I'm not high maintenance: The princess, here with her husband, refutes nickname 'pushy'

Her cats are brought their breakfast on trays carried by servants, she has only braved the high street once in 35 years, and she was horrified when she was told she must ‘downsize’ and reside full-time in Kensington Palace.

Princess Michael of Kent, however, insists she is ‘not very high maintenance’.

In a series of revealing interviews to promote her first novel, the royal – nicknamed Princess Pushy – opened the door to her regal lifestyle.

She said she slept in separate quarters to her husband Prince Michael, so they were ‘fresher for each other’.

And she said she never learned to cook because she always knew she would have a personal chef when she married.

In the frank interviews, she revealed that she disliked her granddaughter Maud’s name and confessed she had never worn Spanx underwear because she feared the fat would be forced south and make her legs ‘bulge out’.

The 68-year-old also said she ‘unashamedly hates’ the foxes that roam outside the palace – a problem, she says, that was exacerbated by her neighbour, the Russian ambassador and his wife, who ‘used to feed them’.

Speaking to The Sunday Times Magazine, she recalled the moment when she was told she would have to sell their £5.7million 16th century mansion, Nether Lypiatt, in Gloucestershire.

They sold the house in 2006 to meet the £120,000-a-year rent on their five-bedroom apartment at Kensington Palace, after being told they could no longer pay a subsidised ‘peppercorn rent’ of just £69-a-week.

She said: ‘Of course I miss the big gardens we had at our country house but it became very expensive to run... we couldn’t afford it.

‘For the first time that terrible word
came into my life when our private secretary said, “Ma’am, you have to 
downsize.” It was the worst word I’d heard in ages.’

Despite the loss of their country pile, the Queen’s cousin and his wife still manage to enjoy some luxuries.

Describing her average day, she said: ‘Breakfast is served on my Herend china and I sit in an old armchair so I can read the papers.

‘I have zero-fat yoghurt with cinnamon, which is meant to be a fat-burner, and a pot of ginger tea made with grated ginger.

‘This I have with lavender honey and one plain Ryvita.’

In a battle against ‘my expanding waistline’, she also drinks a freshly-blended vegetable juice, on the recommendation of her manicurist, which she says is ‘frightfully good’.

Her cats Ruby, a Burmese, and Cally, a Siamese, are then brought their breakfast of chicken breast or ham.

The princess says she then gets dressed, but not in high street garb, revealing: ‘The prince says, “She’s either catalogue or couture”, but most of the time I’m too mean to buy new clothes.

'I think I have only walked down the high street once in my married life.’

The mother-of-two warned against sharing a bedroom with one’s husband, recalling her mother’s words that separate quarters meant ‘you won’t see each other being cross or saying, “I can’t do this up. It’s too tight!”’

The princess learned to cook only five dishes while growing up in Austria, including goulash and tinned salmon soufflé because, as she told her mother, ‘I will have a cook when I marry’.

In a second interview, with the Mail on Sunday’s You magazine, she questioned the name of her granddaughter Maud, the second child of her son Lord Frederick Windsor and his actress wife Sophie Winkleman.

‘Freddie loves the name, and so do lots of other people. But I don’t. I will get used to it, you get used to everything,’ she said.

The princess also claimed that ‘I am not very high-maintenance when it comes to beauty’ and that her ‘only luxury’ is one facial a month.

Princess Michael is currently promoting her historical novel, The Queen of Four Kingdoms, which is based on 15th century European royals.
