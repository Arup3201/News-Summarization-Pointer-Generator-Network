Abou Diaby completed 45 minutes for Arsenal as they kicked off their pre-season with a 2-0 win over Conference South Boreham Wood.

The lesser-spotted French midfielder has made just one appearance for the Gunners since March 2013 when he tore his cruciate knee ligament, a 14-minute cameo at Norwich on the final day of last season.

But after working hard to regain his fitness, the 28-year-old made it through the second half of this clash at Boreham Wood's Meadow Park.

Arsenal: Szczesny (Martinez 46'), Jenkinson (Gibbs 46'), Ajayi (Afobe 46'), Hayden (Rosicky 46'), Monreal (Miquel 46'), Ramsey (Olsson 46'), Coquelin (Pleguezuelo 46'), Zelalem (Diaby 46'), Willock (Akpom 46'), Toral (Bellerin 46'), Sanogo (Flamini 46')

Goals: Olsson 68' Afobe 86'Boreham Wood: Russell, Nunn, Morgan, Garrard, Hill (Mawer 81'), Reynolds, Whichelow, Thomas (Donnelly 81'), Angol (Sterling-Parker 84'), Shakes (Cox 59'), Montgomery (Noto 65')

And he almost marked his return with a 
goal in the 57th minute but his fierce 25-yard drive was tipped over by 
James Russell, in goal for the hosts, managed by former Arsenal winger 
Ian Allinson.

But Russell 
could do nothing to prevent Swedish teen Kristoffer Olsson from opening 
the scoring in the 68th minute when he latched onto a sublime Tomas 
Rosicky through-ball before lifting a delicate finish over the onrushing
 keeper.

And young striker Benik Afobe made it 2-0 after he won and scored a penalty four minutes from time.

Olsson
 and Afobe, along with Diaby, were three of 11 changes made at half time
 by Arsene Wenger, who played a strong team in each 45 made up of the 
club's promising youngsters and the senior players not involved at the 
World Cup.

Aaron Ramsey 
starred in midfield during the first half and almost broke the deadlock 
in the 31st minute but his low drive flashed a yard wide.

Yaya
 Sanogo, who also played in the first half, looked lively up front but 
found Russell in inspired form when he was sent clear twice before the 
interval.

So it was left to 
Olsson, Afobe – and the rest of the second-half side – to ensure Arsenal
 started the pre-season activity with a victory.

Arsene
 Wenger and his squad head to New York on Wednesday, where they will 
face New York Red Bull, fronted by former favourite Thierry Henry, 
before a brief training camp in Austria at the end of the month.
