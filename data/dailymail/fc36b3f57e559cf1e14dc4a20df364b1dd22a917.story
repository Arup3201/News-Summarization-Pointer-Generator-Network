One person has died Tuesday night after a home on Long Island, New York exploded into flames.

Authorities have not yet released the name of the victim and it's still unclear what sparked the blaze.

Local residents say they heard a series of explosions around 8:30pm which shook the neighborhood.

Couple Steve and Nancy Costenbole live nearby on Second Street  and said they head two large thumps which caused them to flee their home.

Smoke: One person has died after a Long Island, New York home burst into flames Wednesday night

Unknown: Authorities have not yet named the victim of the home explosion

'We stood there hoping and praying the fire wasn't going to spread,' Mrs Costenbole told Newsday.

Another 26-year-old neighbor told the New York Daily News that he smelt propane in the air after the blast.

'It was a blast. A blast like you've never heard,' fellow neighbor Ginny Garofalo told ABC New York. 'I actually thought it was a terrorist bomb type of thing I'm not kidding.'

The two-and-a-half story house soon became engulfed in flames, with the fire starting in a garage at the rear of the home, officials said.

The home at or near 10 Prospect Ave is located just across the street from a popular restaurant, Louie's Oyster Bar and Grille, which was packed at the time.

'It was a bang. A bang like you've never heard,' neighbor Ginny Garofalo (pictured) said of the explosion

Burning down: The explosion sparked a five alarm fire that spread to a neighboring house

'We just felt the explosion and then we saw the fire,' Louie's hostess Silvie Navarro said. 'People ran outside. I thought it was a bomb. People were saying "Let's go. Let's go."'

It took firefighters 45 minutes to put out the fire that also spread to a neighboring home.

Four firefighters were injured in the blaze.
