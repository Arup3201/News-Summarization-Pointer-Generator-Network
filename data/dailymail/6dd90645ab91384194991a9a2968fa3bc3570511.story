A teenager who died after hitting his head on an overpass when he stood out of the roof of a party bus has been cited as part of the problem that led to his death.

A new report into the death of Daniel Fernandez has revealed that the 16-year-old was extremely intoxicated, with a blood alcohol level of 0.209 per cent.

While the teen was twice the legal limit, his intoxication was not the only problem found by investigators that they believe they contributed to the August 31, 2012 crash.

The driver, Fedna Balthazar, had an oustanding warrant for his arrest over his failure to appear in court for driving on a suspended license.

He reportedly had driving and moving related suspensions and violations dating back to the 1980s.

ABC News released the highlights of the report, where investigator John Pierotti Jr wrote that Balthazar was not the only adult with a role in the accident.

There were supposed to be two adult chaperones to accompany the 64 teenagers on the bus headed to Sweet 16 birthday party.

The 64 teenagers were spread among the party bus' two floors which teatured a VIP room with satellite TV and WiFi.

The roof hatch was supposed to be locked using the safety bolt, but that apparently was undone when the bus hit a bump.

The fatal accident occurred on the Nw Jersey side of the George Washington Bridge as the students from St. Francis Prepatory School in Queens were headed to a party in Garfield, New Jersey.

Fernandez was standing on the top floor of the bus with his head and shoulders outside of the roof hatch.

His friends all saw him nearly get decapitated before he fell to the floor.

'Panic ensued,' the report states.

Twitter user Kaylan Baez was apparently on the double-decker bus, and wrote early Saturday morning: ‘Never thought I would ever witness something like that. My prayers go out to dan and his family. R.I.P. Daniel Fernandez.’

Shock: One girl apparently witnessed Mr Fernandez's death and tweeted her disbelief

Partying:

Earlier in the evening, she was tweeting about how excited she was for the party.

Another girl who was on the bus tweeted: 'Sitting here with your blood on my foot wishing this was all a bad dream. I love you so much Dan you were there for me till the last second.'

The teenager was hurried to Hackensack University Medical Center, but was pronounced dead on arrival, according to Port Authority spokesman Steve Coleman.

Fernandez was not the only teen on the bus believed to be drinking at the time of the accident, as it was discovered that they snuck alcohol on board by pouring it into bottles of Arizona Iced Tea.

Tweets show how the friends planned on getting ‘sauced’ at the Sweet 16 party.

Hours before heading to the party bus, Fernandez asked a friend over Twitter: ‘Are they checking on the bus??’

Another party-goer tweeted: ‘The amount of bottles on this limo is rediculous.’ [sic]
