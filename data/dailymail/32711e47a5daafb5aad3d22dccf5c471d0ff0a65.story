A street was covered in seaweed after it fell from the sky during freak weather which carried it from a beach 20 miles away.

Residents were stunned to find their homes, gardens and cars plastered with smelly marine algae after a storm swept up debris from Clevedon Beach in North Somerset and dumped it in Berkeley, near Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on Sunday.

Weather experts believe the unusual downpour was caused by a tornado which formed from several thunderstorms in the area.

Resident Dr Richard Overton, 55, collected an entire bucket full of the green gunk from his front garden with still more to clear up.

The engineer said: ‘I looked out of the window after a very big storm finished and to my amazement there were lots of flakes of seaweed scattered over the garden.

‘I’ve heard stories of fish being picked up and dumped by storms but never seaweed. I was just so surprised.

Caused by thunderstorms: Weather experts believe several thunderstorms on Clevedon Beach and another nearby created a tornado that could have swept up the seaweed, dumping it in Berkeley 20 miles away

‘It’s a shame really because had it have been fish we could have made a tasty dish with it but you can’t really do the same with seaweed.’

Weather expert, Ian Fergusson from the Met Office, said the strange downpour could have occurred because of thunderstorms on Clevedon Beach.

Fish - reported several times

Frogs and tadpoles - Greece, 1981

Squid - Falklands Island, 1997

Spiders - Argentina, 2007

He said: ‘At the same time as this incident was reported there were several thunderstorms in the area, one of which was pictured by satellites, on a nearby beach.

‘If one of the funnel clouds touched down onto the beach, making it a tornado it could have quite possibly picked up the seaweed and other debris if the tide was out and then later dumped it down the road at Berkeley Heath.

‘It is a very strange event but it is possible. Look out for fish in your garden too!’

Dr Overton’s wife Kay said they were struggling of clear all the debris from their garden because so much seaweed had fallen.

She said: ‘We’ve managed to pick up 
quite a lot of it now but there is still loads there because it’s 
camouflaged in the bushes and grass.’

Far away: Seaweed from Clevedon Beach in North Somerset made up the unusual downpour that plastered a residential street on Sunday

Dr Overton said: ‘We’ve put it all in a big pot and we’ll probably just wait for it to wither away. It’s quite funny really, just so strange.’

Other residents on ‘The Common’, an up-market lane which overlooks acres of fields, also found seaweed in their gardens.

Neighbour Steven Belton said: ‘We had really heavy rain yesterday (Sunday), our garden was almost flooded.

‘We didn’t really notice anything out of the ordinary but after speaking to Richard and Kay we found quite a lot of the seaweed in out driveway.

‘It’s very strange, just so, so odd.’
