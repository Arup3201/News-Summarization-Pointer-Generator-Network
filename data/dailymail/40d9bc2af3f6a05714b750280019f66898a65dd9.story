The sister of Kim Kardashian's soon-to-be-ex-husband Kris Humphries is making a name for herself in the world of fashion, modelling the new spring/summer 2013 line for plus-size brand Evans.

Kaela Humphries, 29, who lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota, is a former competitive swimmer who signed to New York modelling agency Ford+ after hanging up her goggles.

Kaela, who was a bridesmaid at Kim and NBA star Kris' wedding in August 2011, has spoken previously about how she had to give her diet a complete overhaul in order to lose the 40lbs she gained after quitting swimming.

The blue-eyed brunette beauty - who stands at 5'11'' tall, has a 38DD chest and wears an American size 16, equivalent to a UK size 20 - appears in a number of glamorous campaign shots for the retailer, wearing elegant, brightly coloured dresses, sparkly sleeveless tops and dark, slimming trousers.

Kaela relocated back to her hometown of Minnesota from New York in march last year, just as she was announced as was the face of Limited's Eloquii line in April. She quit a job in medical sales to pursue plus-size modelling.

At the time she told People magazine: 'You are sort of used to living and eating a certain way, and then you are like, "Oh my God, I can't eat ten meals a day and 10,000 calories anymore.

'I'm approaching 30 and it gets harder to lose weight the older you get.'

Kaela revealed that her weight fluctuated from a US size 10 to 12 in high school, and went as far as an 18 after college.

She said: 'Looking healthy is important in anything you do. It should have been more of a priority earlier. But it's hard when you have a full-time job in the real world and it's not your job to be in shape.

She said she didn't know there was such a thing as plus-size modelling, until a photographer saw her picture and told her she has 'pretty eyes', so she decided to give it a go.

Shortly after, she booked shoots with both Nordstrom and Kohl's.

Kaela has said that she avoids eating carbohydrates after 8pm and works out twice a day for up to two hours, but still indulges in treats every now and again.

She said: 'Even if I am a plus-size model, I have to be in the best shape for me. And I'll have the hamburger,' she added, 'But I should probably say I'm getting a salad.'

Her agency Ford said they believe she will follow in the steps of plus-size models Crystal Renn and Ashley Graham, saying in a statement: 'A true size 16-18, Kaela will be in a league of her own.'

Kaela Humphries for Evans

What is the one style rule you live by?

Kaela: Wear clothing that looks best on me and fits the most comfortably – comfort is super important to me. Who are your fashion icons and inspirations?

K: My friends. I really enjoy seeing the different trends that my friends have. They look good, they have really nice clothing and we often have the same outfits. What would be your new season must have from the spring / summer 2013 Evans range?

K: It would have to be the black and blue shirt [second picture]. It’s extremely comfortable, I like the detail and the blue part is sheer. I really like black too, so I would wear this all the time. What’s the perfect outfit choice for you?

K: Something that’s comfortable, wearable and extenuates my assets. I believe Evans has a lot of outfits in their 2013 line that are great choices for me. Are you excited to be modelling for the plus size market?

K: I’m extremely excited to be modelling for the plus size market and I feel extremely blessed to have the opportunity. What advice would you give women with body confidence issues?

K: First and foremost, you need to be your biggest fan! You need to always speak highly of yourself and wear clothes that make you feel good, whether that’s comfortable clothing or clothes that are flattering on your body shape. Everybody in my opinion has assets that are beautiful, and believing in yourself is that first step. Where's your favourite place in the world?

K: Anywhere that means I’m surrounding by my friends and family. Coming from Minnesota that's really important to me, and they're the people who support me through everything I do. What’s on your iPod at the moment?

K: The Weeknd, he's my new favourite artist and is from Toronto. He's very unique and I listen to it all the time. What’s your favourite food?

K: Mexican - and my signature dish to cook is fish tacos.

What are your three handbag essentials for the red carpet?

K: Powder, fashion tape and lip-gloss. Flats or heels?

K: Definitely heels. Dress or jeans?

K: Probably a dress. Cleavage or legs?

K: Both!Summer or winter?

K: Winter – I really like layers. Eat in or take out?

K: Eat in because I really like to cook.Hair up or hair down?

K: I enjoy wearing my hair up, but most of my friends and family like it down, so I wear it down most of the time. Stay in or go out?

K: On a Friday or Saturday, it would probably be going out – I'm a social butterfly. Maxi or midi?

K: Maxi dress, for sure. Britney or Madonna?

K: Definitely Madonna.
