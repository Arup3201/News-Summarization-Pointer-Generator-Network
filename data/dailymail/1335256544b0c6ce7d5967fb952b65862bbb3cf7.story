This chilling footage from a conservation park in the US shows a tiger stalking its keeper while his back his turned.

In the video captured by senior keeper Steve Klein,  a Bengal-Siberian mix named Mohan shows off his hunting skills at the Cedar Cove tiger habitat in Kansas. 

The clip is an excellent example of a tiger's silent, yet deadly approach - and it would have been a clean kill if not for the chain-link fence that separated the predator from its keeper.

Steve set up a backwards-facing camera so that he could turn away from the animal.

In doing so, Steve believed that Mohan would begin to attempt to approach his 'prey.'

Although he moves cautiously at first, Mohan is careful to use ambient noise and to adjust his path out of his prey's field of view in order to remain undetected.

Once the skilful tiger gets within a few feet of the fence, he pounces - offering a rare glimpse at what it would be like to be attacked by such a stunning animal in the wild.

Cedar Cove is a public sanctuary near Kansas City which promotes education and awareness of the tiger's ongoing plight against extinction.

Currently, the Feline Conservatory and Education Center has over 27 animals in its care and operates primarily as a rescue facility.

In the wild today, there is a tiger population of about 3,500 spread among six remaining sub-species. The rest have been lost to poaching, deforestation and other human encroachments.
