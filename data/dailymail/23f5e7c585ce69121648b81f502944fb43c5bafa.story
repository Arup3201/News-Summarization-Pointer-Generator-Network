The number of New Zealanders taking the leap across the ditch to Australia is on the decline, despite more Australians moving to the land of the long white cloud.

New statistics show just 30,500 people living in New Zealand opted to move to Australia during the 2013/2014 financial year, just under 40 percent lower than the 48,000 in the previous year.

On top of that, the number of people relocating to New Zealand from Australia rose to 22,200 from 16,800 for the previous period. New Zealand citizens were responsible for most movement in both directions.

These figures are in line with statistics from the past month which indicate New Zealanders are choosing to stay home or come home as Australia faces tougher economic times.

For the first time since August 1991, migration is at such a low point that there is no net figure for the amount of New Zealanders who made the move to Australia in June.

Statistics New Zealand also released figures showing visitor arrivals for June were 162,100, the highest on record for a June month.

Population statistics manager Vina Cullum told AAP growth was driven by visitors from Asia, especially Japan and China, who were opting to holiday in New Zealand.

Visitor arrivals numbered 2.79 million in the year to June 2014, up six per cent from the previous year. Most flew in from Australia, China, the United States and the United Kingdom.

In a historic jump, annual migrant arrivals were 100,8000 - the first time in New Zealand's history that number has been over 100,000.

Migrant departures numbered 62,400, down 22 per cent on the previous year, leaving a net gain of 38,300 migrants, the highest annual gain since the October 2003 year.

Ms Cullum said net migration has been positive and primarily on the up since September 2012.
