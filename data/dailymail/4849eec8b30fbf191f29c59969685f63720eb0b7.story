'Absolutely no one is listening to your cry for assistance. It's the ultimate in dehumanisation.'

It has been a long journey for Munjed Al Muderis.

Fleeing the oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein's Iraq, and crossing the seas to Australia in a boat headed for Christmas Island, the young man found himself living in the infamous Curtin Detention Centre.

Now an Australian citizen and a pioneering surgeon enabling soldiers to walk again, Al Muderis's story is as extraordinary as it is harrowing.

'There are always two sides to every story,' Dr Al Muderis told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I wanted to tell the story of living through the reign of Saddam Hussein, and at the same time show the harshness inside detention centres in Australia.'

Dr Munjed Al Muderis fled Iraq in 1999 after a squad of military police ordered his surgical team to mutilate the ears of amry deserters

In 1999, two years after qualifying as a surgical resident, Dr Al Muderis was wrapped up in a seemingly routine day working in a Baghdad hospital, when a squad of military police marched into the operating theatre and demanded that the surgical team amputate the ears of army and draft deserters, on orders from Saddam Hussein himself.

The head of surgery refused, and was dragged outside to be executed. 

'If anyone else shares his view, step forward. Otherwise carry on,' said one of the military 'thugs'. 

Dr Al Muderis saw his three options: carry out the operations, refuse to perform them and face the consequences, or hide. 

Seeking refuge in a hidden toilet cubicle in the women's locker room, all Dr Al Muderis knew was that he had to escape the barbaric regime of Saddam Hussein which had ripped apart the country he had grown up in.

Crossing the Jordan border with $22,000 strapped to his stomach, he made a snap decision which would change his life permanently: he chose to board a boat carrying more than 150 passengers, heading towards Australia, away from one kind of danger and into the arms of another.

Stripped of his name, and instead identified by a number, Dr Al Muderis was detained in Curtin Detention Centre in Western Australia for ten months.

'Like everyone else in Curtin, I felt completely lost, isolated and helpless,' he wrote.

'As an absolute stranger in a foreign land, with no contacts and no one to care for you or offer support, that doesn't give you a feeling of welcome or belonging.'  

In the sweltering heat of the Kimberley Desert, the passionate advocate for education acted as an intermediary between other detainees and the guards, starting a shanty school for children in the detention centre to stave off boredom.

Describing the inadequate health care, food and living conditions, Dr Al Muderi said, 'We sensed the detention centre management was trying to deprive us of everything, including our names, in an effort to force us to go back to the countries we came from.'

The chronic overcrowding, racial abuse, high levels of self-mutilation and suicide attempts, and long application processes were condemned in 2001 in an inquiry commissioned by the Howard federal government.

Surprisingly, Dr Al Muderi is not against mandatory detention, but his descriptions of the lengths to which his fellow detainees went to protest their living conditions highlight his plea for more humane approaches to the issue of asylum seekers.

'Refugees should be investigated or detained, at least until they are cleared of diseases, and until the government is sure they aren't carrying fundamental views of potential terrorists,'

'But this can be done in a much more humane and cost effective way. Asylum seekers should not be detained indefinitely, and they should be given access to education, in order to learn Australian values.'

'I also believe that no child should be detained. I've seen children spending 10 months in detention without learning one sentence. That is wrong.'

After being charged with inciting a breakout of detainees at Curtin Detention Centre, Dr Al Muderi was transferred to Broome Jail, and describes the fleeting contact he had with his mother, calling her to let her know he was safe- although in a maximum security prison.

After a lengthy trial, he was cleared of the charges, processed by the government and found himself a legal refugee. His immediate course of action was to find a job, and within two months of being released from the detention centre was working as a medical practitioner.

'My motivation for writing the book was I felt that people deserved to see a different side of refugees. Some people who come over can have a positive influence and input into society.' 

After undergoing a gruelling four-year orthopaedic training program, Dr Al Muderi excelled in the field of hip and knee replacement surgery, forming his own thoughts on the next stages of 'osseointegration', or the process of making bones 'whole' again.

During his time at Austin Hospital in Melbourne, he fulfilled his dream of becoming an orthopedic robotic limb surgeon, working with state-of-the-art technology to assist those who have lost limbs in combat.

Precisely a decade after Dr Al Muderi landed on Christmas Island, one of his patients tragically lost both of his legs after stepping on an insurgent bomb in southern Afghanistan.

Michael Swain, a British rifleman, was only 20 years old and two months into his tour with Britain’s 3 Rifles in the Helmand Province when his legs were blown off.

Swain spent three years in rehab, spending 18 months learning how to walk with prosthetic legs, but was frustrated with his lack of mobility.

After a long battle, he managed to convince the Ministry of Defence to sponsor an osseointegration procedure, after meeting a patient of Dr Al Muderis’ at a clinic in England who had undergone the surgery.

Swain flew to Australia to have titanium implants and adaptors fitted to the artificial bone that fits directly onto a robotic leg, all by an Iraqi refugee.

The procedure is what has garnered the most attention for Dr Al Muderis, as the pioneering surgery sees bone and muscle grow around the titanium on the bone end,  creating an essentially bionic leg.

Dr Al Muderis was invited by the Queen of England to attend the ceremony in which Rifleman Swain received his MBE medal, and was able to see for himself the benefits of osseointegration beyond the procedure.

'What really strikes me as more influential was the moment when he walked back home four weeks after the surgery. He was filmed while walking up to house, and his wife was standing in the window. She said to her little son, "Look, this is daddy, he’s coming back home," and the child said, "No this is not daddy. Daddy doesn’t walk.

'It brought tears to my eyes, knowing that I made a difference. It's that which keeps me going.'

'We are in process of receiving more soldiers from Britain, some who lost their legs in Afghanistan. As a person who comes from that same area I feel humbled and honoured to be allowed and chosen to help these people fighting for people from my region.' 

'I believe that all humans have a duty in their life, our duty is to help others and make things better.'

'So I'm not here, coming with a magic wand and having quick fix, but asylum seekers, and all people can be treated better.'
