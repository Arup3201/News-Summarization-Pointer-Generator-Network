Return: Sam Mendes will be back in the director's chair for Daniel Craig's next outing as James Bond,  producers have revealed

Sam Mendes will be back in the director’s chair for Daniel Craig’s next outing as James Bond,  producers revealed yesterday.

There had been doubts as to whether Mendes – who directed Skyfall – would work on the next 007 film because of his workload for the musical production of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

But producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli yesterday confirmed Mendes would direct the as-yet unnamed film and Craig would reprise the role of Bond.

The 24th film in the franchise, which is set to be released in October 2015, will be awaited with much anticipation after Skyfall became the highest-grossing film ever in Britain.

It took £94.3million at the UK box office in just 40 days.

Mendes, who won an Academy Award for 
directing American Beauty, said: ‘I am very pleased that by giving me 
the time I need to honour all my theatre commitments, the producers have
 made it possible for me to direct Bond 24.

‘I very much look forward to taking up the reins again, and to working 
with Daniel Craig, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli for a second 
time.’

Mendes’s collaboration with Daniel Craig
 and a new cast including Ralph Fiennes and Ben Whishaw was widely 
praised by critics and helped the film become a major commercial 
success.

In a statement the producers said: ‘Following the extraordinary success 
of Skyfall, we’re really excited to be working once again with Daniel 
Craig, Sam Mendes and John Logan.

Barber added, ‘We are thrilled to reunite the extraordinary talents of 
director Sam Mendes with our star Daniel Craig for the next great Bond 
adventure.’

He added: ‘As evidenced by the phenomenal success of our last 
collaboration with EON Productions and Sony, the incredible legacy of 
this 51-year-old franchise continues to amaze.’

Lynton and Pascal said: ‘It’s a privilege to work on the Bond films. 
EON, John Logan and Sam Mendes have come up with an extraordinary follow
 up to SKyfall and we, along with our partners at MGM, can’t wait to 
share this new chapter with audiences all over the world.’
