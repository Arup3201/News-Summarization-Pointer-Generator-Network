Despite a collection of seemingly racist rants about 'negros,' slavery and 'picking cotton,' not everyone thinks Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy is a racist, and one of the people defending the one-time far-right-wing folk hero is one of his bodyguards - who happens to be black.

Jason Bullock has been at Bundy's side since his battle with the federal government began heating up in late March. According to Bullock, the man he's come to know over the last month is not a racist.

In fact, Bullock says he would take a bullet for Bundy.

Not racist: Bullock says he is not offended by the comments Bundy has made and says he looks at him as a grandfather figure

Bullock was recently interviewed by CNN and asked, 'You're protecting this man and he's wondering whether African-Americans would be better off as slaves. How does that strike you?'

'It doesn't strike me any kind of way,' Bullock answered. 'This is still the same old Mr. Bundy I met from the first day of all this happening.'

Bullock says the things Bundy has been saying - 'wondering' if 'negros' were better off under slavery, and comparing himself to civil rights hero Rosa Parks, for example - don't offend him.

'Mr. Bundy is not a racist. Ever since I've been here he's treated me with nothing but hospitality,' Bullock told the reporter. 'He's pretty much treated me like his own family.'

He goes on to say that 'I would take a bullet for that man, if need be,' and that he 'look(s) up to him just like I do my grandfather.'

The cause: Bullock says he believes in Bundy's cause, which is why he is willing to give his life to defend him

'I believe in his cause and after having 
met Mr. Bundy a few times, I have a really good feel about him and I'm a
 pretty good judge of character,' Bullock said.

However, Bundy's racist rants have led to public outcry and political allies distancing themselves - but Bundy doesn't see what all the fuss is about, claiming he is just like Rosa Parks and 'standing up against laws which destroy our freedom'.

Bundy has become something of a celebrity in his frontier, Nevada stronghold since his showdown over cattle-grazing land with federal authorities earlier this month. He was quickly upheld as a hero by the right with Senator Rand Paul dubbing him a 'patriot'.

However, that reputation is now in tatters after Bundy's series of racist rants - and it appears he just can't help fanning the flames with further remarks.

On Friday, he invoked the heroic actions of Rosa Parks, the civil rights icon who was arrested in 1955 after refusing to give up her bus seat to a white man in Montgomery, Alabama. Her actions sparked the Montgomery bus boycott and were a defining moment of the civil rights' movement.

Nevada Cattle rancher Cliven Bundy held up his boot today for the cameras as he said he 'didn't want to put his foot in his mouth with the boot on' following the uproar over his racist remarks

On the Bundy Ranch Facebook page on Friday, he wrote: 'I
 am doing the same thing Rosa Parks did - I am standing up against bad 
laws which dehumanize us and destroy our freedom. Just like the 
Minutemen at Lexington and Concord, we are saying no to an oppressive 
government which considers us to be slaves rather than free men.

'I
 invite all people in America to join in our peaceful revolution to 
regain our freedom. That is how America was started, and we need to keep
 that tradition alive.'

Bundy earlier said that if people were offended by his use of the word 'negro' or 'slave' then 'Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet'.

The Conservative father of 14 told CNN: 'If I say Negro or black boy or slave, if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn't got his job done yet....We need to get over this prejudice stuff.'

Later in the rambling interview, he whipped off his cowboy boot and said: 'I didn't want to put my foot in my mouth with the boot on.'

Officials had tried to round up Bundy's 
cattle and evict him on April 12 after 20 years of not paying federal taxes. 
However they were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred 
people, some of them armed with sniper rifles, turned up and threatened 
to open fire.

When asked by CNN host Bill Weir whether he was a 'welfare queen' on Thursday, Bundy responded: 'I might be a welfare queen. But I'll tell you I'm producing something for America and using a resource that nobody else would use or could use. I'm putting red meat on the table.'

Bundy was forced to abandon his speeches about the 'overreaching' federal government on Thursday when his racist remarks emerged in a New York Times' article. 

Flanked by armed supporters, rancher Cliven Bundy speaks at a protest camp near Bunkerville, Nevada on April 18. He was adopted by the right as a hero but many public figures are now distancing themselves following his racist remarks

During his speech, Bundy shared a story of driving through a housing project in Las Vegas, according to a report by the New York Times, beginning his tale with the words: 'I want to tell you one more thing I know about the Negro.'

He said: 'In front of that 
government house the door was usually open and the older people and the 
kids - and there is always at least a half a dozen people sitting on the
 porch - they didn’t have nothing to do. They didn’t have nothing for 
their kids to do. They didn’t have nothing for their young girls to do.

'And
 because they were basically on government subsidy, so now what do they 
do? They abort their young children, they put their young 
men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton.

And I’ve 
often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having
 a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government
 subsidy? They didn’t get no more freedom. They got less freedom.'

Mr Bundy, a 67-year-old father-of 14 and registered Republican, is
 accused of not paying federal grazing taxes for his cattle for 20 
years, and reportedly owes the government $1million.

A federal taskforce
 has been setup to deal with him, Senate majority leader and Nevada Democrat Harry Reid said last week, branding Bundy a 'domestic terrorist'. 

Reid accused the militia supporting Reid of deliberately putting women and children into the firing line so that, in the event of violence, they got hurt first ensuring the worst possible headlines.

Meanwhile Bundy has warned that he will never back down down from his fight.

'They will come, and I don't care,' he told MailOnline earlier this month. 'The people and citizens of America will win this fight. We have God on our side and we will be better prepared for them next time.'

He said supporters from across the U.S., many of the armed a prepared to defend themselves, were heading for the remote town of Bunkersville, about 80 miles from Las Vegas in southern Nevada.

He said: 'People have been mobilized by what they have seen and heard and they will come here because they see it as their right to defend the land.'

Officials tried to round up Bundy's cattle and evict him on April 12 but were forced to give up after a militia of several hundred people, some of them armed, turned up and threatened to open fire

Bundy won the first round of his fight with agents from the Bureau of Land 
Management after they released several hundred cows they had seized as 
part of a long running dispute over grazing rights in Nevada.

Craig Leff, from the Bureau of Land Management, told the Times: 'The gather is now over. Our focus is pursuing this matter 
administratively and judicially.'

Fears
 of an armed confrontation with dozens of armed militia who had camped 
out in a field leading to Bundy's ranch led federal officials to call 
off their operation.

Supporters
 of Bundy hailed the decision as a victory - but the decision was taken 
in part because Clark County Sheriff's feared violence could erupt at 
any moment.

Many
 of the militia, who wore camouflage clothing and stalked the roads 
around the Bundy home carrying automatic weapons,said they were prepared
 to take on the federal agents in a fire fight.

One was overheard boasting that he had two agent in his gun sight and could 'take them down'.

The
 dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he 
stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze 
public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave 
Desert tortoise.

Land managers limited the Bundy herd to just 150 head on a land which the rancher claims has been in his family for more than 140 years.

The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle.

Last week, they began an operation to seize his cattle prompting the stand off and mini invasion by militia members from California, Arizona, Montana and Utah to rush to his support.

Clark County Sheriff Doug Gillespie was able to negotiate a resolution after talking with Bundy.

It has not been revealed if Bundy would pay the estimated $1.2million he owes to the Government.

The dispute that ultimately triggered the roundup dates to 1993, when the bureau cited concern for the federally protected tortoise in the region.

The bureau revoked Bundy's grazing rights after he stopped paying grazing fees and disregarded federal court orders to remove his animals.

The fight between Bundy and the Bureau of Land Management widened into a debate about states' rights and federal land-use policy.
