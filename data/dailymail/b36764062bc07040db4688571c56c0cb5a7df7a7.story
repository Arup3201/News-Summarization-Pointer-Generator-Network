Chilli peppers are providing scientists with vital clues on how to cure migraines.

Research has found there are striking similarities between what happens in the brain during a migraine and the way skin reacts to having chilli oil rubbed into it.

Now, scientists are using the way the body deals with chilli to develop migraine drugs.

Research has found there are striking similarities between what happens in the brain during a migraine and the way skin reacts to having chilli oil rubbed into it

They found that when chilli oil touches the skin, the capsaicin in the
 pepper causes the body to release calcitonin gene-related peptides, or CGRP, leading to an increase in blood flow to the affected area.

Biotechnology companies 
are now targeting a chemical released during a migraine that carries a 'pain' signal from nerve to nerve.

By blocking a nerve receptor from receiving 
the message, these companies hope to develop drugs that prevent debilitating attacks.

One company developing a migraine drug is Amgen. To test the chilli theory, researchers injected the proposed drug under the skin 
of patients who had chilli oil on their skin.

The drug blocked the 
CGRP that causes increased blood flow.

One theory is that migraines are caused by enlarged blood vessels.

And by blocking a receptor in the brain from 
receiving the message, migraines could be avoided completely, Peter
 Goadsby, director of the University of California, San Franciscoâ€™s 
Headache Centre, told Bloomberg.

'What these antibody approaches hope to do is to either block the receptor or mop up the CGRP itself,' he said. 

Despite being such a common problem, no drugs have been 'developed specifically for the treatment of migraines', Rob
 Lenz, who is leading the migraine drug development for pharmaceutical company Amgen.

'They were developed as anti-epileptics, or blood pressure lowering agent,' he told the website.

Currently, the most widely used medication for migraines is triptans, which constrict blood vessels
 in the brain to relieve swelling and pain. But these are only taken once migraines are in full swing.

Botox is also approved as a preventative treatment for migraines, though only for severe sufferers.

It is thought the new type of drug being developed would be for people who suffer migraines less often.

There are similarities between what happens to brain during a migraine and how skin reacts to chilli oil

When chilli touches the skin, it causes the release of a substance called CGRP, which increases blood flow

Now hoped migraine drugs could be developed using same mechanism, to block pain signals
