Andy Murray has revealed his coaching partnership with Amelie Mauresmo began with a text message - but the former Wimbledon champion kept her new charge waiting.

Murray teamed up with the Frenchwoman after splitting with Ivan Lendl and began the relationship with a straight-sets win over Paul-Henri Mathieu at Queen’s on Wednesday.

And the Scot hopes it can become a long-term arrangement.

New partnership: Andy Murray has teamed up with Amelie Mauresmo on a trial basis

Writing in his BBC column, Murray said: ‘My partnership with Amelie Mauresmo began with a text message: “I’m looking for a coach at the moment. If you’re interested in chatting to me, let me know.”

'I don’t know if she was surprised to hear from me, but she did make me wait overnight before messaging me back the next morning. A month or so later, here we are at Queen’s Club, and off to a winning start on the grass.'

Murray also admitted that parting company with Lendl, who helped him win the US Open and Wimbledon titles, was difficult.

‘The split with Ivan Lendl was also hard to get over for a little while because he was a huge part of my career,’ he said. ‘He had a big influence on me and my team.

‘He was the leader because of all the things he achieved and the results we had together. That gives you more influence. If things are going horribly it’s a bit different, but things had gone very well.

'It was tough for me, for sure, for a few weeks, but once I started thinking about different coaches, I started to move on and look for something different.

‘It’s very early days with Amelie and part of the job is making her feel comfortable around me and the rest of the team.’

P.S. Murray teams up with Groves at Queen's

Andy Murray is well known for his love of boxing and he posed for a picture with British super middleweight George Groves on Wednesday.

Groves is back in London after a holiday in Dubai following his brutal knockout defeat to Carl Froch at Wembley last month.

He is expected to return to the ring in the autumn.
