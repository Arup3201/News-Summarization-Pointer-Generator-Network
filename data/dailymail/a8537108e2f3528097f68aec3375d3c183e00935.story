An 81-year-old horror film director has been arrested for 'violently groping' a woman in his luxurious New York City building on New Year's Eve, police said.

Joel Reed, who created Blood Sucking Freaks (1976) and G.I. Executioner (1975), is accused of placing his hand on the woman's groin then twisted her hand, pushing her to the ground.

The alleged victim was left with a swollen finger, shoulder and hip, as well as 'substantial pain', according to a police report.

A 46-year-old woman named Nava Shapiro was also arrested and charged with assault in the incident.

Reed was arrested at 3am on New Year's Day in the Upper West Side building, the New York Post reported.

A judge at Manhattan Criminal Court released Reed without bail after an arraignment on Thursday.

He will appear in court later this year charged with assault, forcible touching, sexual abuse, and harassment.
