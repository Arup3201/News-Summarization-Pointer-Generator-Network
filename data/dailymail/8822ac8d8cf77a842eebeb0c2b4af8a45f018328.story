Aldi is piling pressure on the supermarket giants by pledging to double its number of stores nationwide.

Buoyed by the scale of its success in attracting millions of new customers, the German discount chain has vowed to double its size to 1,000 stores in the next seven years, according to a report yesterday.

Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons have seen their profits fall  as more families switch to Aldi’s cheaper products.

Aldi claims it will be adding between 50 and 65 new stores a year until 2021 when they should have 1,000 stores across the country

Joint managing director Matthew Barnes said that Aldi plans to accelerate store openings from 50 to 65 a year from next year.

If it achieves that rate of growth every year, it will hit 1,000 stores  by 2021. It also plans to upgrade its existing stores.

‘For the foreseeable future, 65 new stores a year is not out of the question,’ Mr Barnes said. ‘We think 1,000 stores is an absolute possibility.’

By contrast the biggest supermarkets have been struggling -- Tesco’s sales fell 3.1per cent and Morrisons’ sales were down 3.9per cent.

The discounter is also working on plans to upgrade its existing stores to boost sales and steal even more customers from its big rivals.

Aldi says that it has been building extensions and bigger car parks because in some locations it has been a victim of its own success leading to bottlenecks in car parks or at tills.

Retail experts believe that the discount retailers are benefiting as they seek better value than that on offer from traditional supermarkets such as Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons
