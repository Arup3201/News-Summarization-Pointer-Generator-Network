A knifeman who stabbed four police officers in a butcher's shop using a stolen meat cleaver was heard chanting ‘God help me to kill my enemies’ moments before the attack.

Christopher Haughton, 33, was described as ‘acting very strangely’ prior to the attack by a the first police officer who arrived at the scene, a court heard today.

PC Stephen Barker was responding to a call about a man shouting in the street in Kingsbury, northwest London and spotted Mr Haughton screaming at a block of flats.

Attack: Police have cordoned off the scene as medical supplies is seen strewn across the road in Kingsbury, northwest London at the time of the stabbings

He told the Old Bailey: He was obviously causing concern to members of the public.

‘Once we got a little bit closer, we worked out what he was saying: “God help me to kill my enemies.”

‘I tried to speak to Mr Haughton, but I got no response. I asked him his name, and he replied: “You don’t need my name - I’m just f***ing angry”.

‘He ignored me, and continued to shout as before, about killing his “enemies”.

‘In a vain attempt to calm the situation, I tapped him gently on his left shoulder, and said “calm down, tell me what the matter is”.’

Responding immediately, the paranoid schizophrenic clenched his fist and threw a punch towards PC Barker, jurors heard.

Evidence: PC Stephen Barker, seen arriving at the Old Bailey today, said Christopher Haughton bit him and tore his sleeve off with his teeth

The two officers then grappled with him 
as they tried to make an arrest, but were thrown off by the ‘unusually 
strong’ paranoid schizophrenic.

PC Barker said: ‘He put his head down - I initially thought he was trying to struggle free - but he was biting my left arm.

‘It took a few seconds to acknowledge the fact he was biting me, and then it was searing pain - enough for me to let go.

‘When I pulled my jacket away, it firmly remained within Mr Haughton’s jaws, and he ripped the sleeve off.’

The two officers had been called to the scene outside a hairdressers in Kenton Road at around 9am on November 19 last year - some 300 metres from the butchers shop where their colleagues were later stabbed.

Both men then drew their batons, before calling for backup and making another unsuccessful attempt to detain Haughton.

Minutes later, in CCTV footage shown to the jury, the knifeman can be seen storming into Kingsbury Road Halal Butchers, pursued by a group of police officers.

In the recording, taken outside from a camera in the street, members of the public can be seen massing outside the butchers as the alleged attacks take place.

After a short pause, police can be 
seen running from the building, with an injured officer being dragged 
out by his desperate colleagues.

Mr Haughton had grabbed a fillet knife from the butcher’s shop and launched an attack on the police officers, it was said.

After officers managed to subdue him, he shouted ‘Kill me, kill me, I want to die. I want to come back as Freddie Kruger.’

He
added ‘F*****g pigs, I hope you all die, and all your children die,’ as
he chanted and hurled Caribbean insults, such as ‘you bumbaclat’.

When
formally arrested at the police station, he replied: ‘You can f*****g 
put me in jail for life. I want to kill you all, I’ll kill more of you 
next time.’

He then said: ‘I curse all of you, I hope those officers die,’ ‘I’m Lucifer, you all have Aids now,’ and ‘I have Aids, I love giving women Aids. I hope you all get Aids.’

It was alleged that as police tried to put Haughton into handcuffs he attempted to stab another officer in the neck

Prosecutor
Edward Brown QC said: 'Some of the officers suffered very significant 
injuries indeed, all the result of this defendant’s violence.

'It was perhaps only a matter of very good fortune that some of the police officers escaped with their lives.'

One
officer PC Thomas Harding tried to pin him down with a riot shield but 
Haughton managed to straddle him and stabbed the officer in the stomach,
it was said.

As another 
officer PC Alastair Hinchliff tried to restrain him, he too fell to the 
floor and Haughton, it was said, slashed him across the left side of his face from 
temple to ear with the knife penetrating his cheek into the mouth.

He
then stabbed PC Hinchliff in the upper and lower arm exposing the 
muscle and tendons of the arm as other officers struck him with their 
batons with no effect, it was claimed.

As they did this Haughton lashed out twice cutting across PC Andre Robb’s knee causing a 15 cm wound, Mr Brown said.

The
Old Bailey heard 'despite his continued violence, officers were able to
pin the defendant against the meat display counter, with his head 
forced downwards.'

Before launching his alleged attack, Haughton went into a butcher's shop where he took a fillet knife, it was claimed in court

But as they tried to cuff him, Haughton attempted to stab PC Shaun Haque in the neck but an officer managed to grab his wrists and the blade stopped just millimetres away.

Prosecutor Edward Brown QC said: 'The scene was a dreadful one - officers very badly injured, some critically so and blood everywhere from their injuries, with police and ambulance personnel doing what they could to give first aid to the officers before they were rushed to hospital.

'Uninjured officers succeeded in handcuffing the defendant, placing him in leg restraints and he was taken to a police van.

'Three officers remained in the back of the van to ensure both the safety of the defendant and to control him. He continued to be violent and aggressive even when restrained.'

Haughton was on bail when he went on the rampage and 'it demonstrates how his hostility towards the police was not something that arose just on the morning of 19th November.

'It will become plain during the evidence that the defendant was in a disturbed state of mind at the time. In the months that followed he was diagnosed as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.'

But he added Haughton had the intention to kill the police officers as he had 'called out that he wanted to kill the police who were there, and threatened to do so,' and 'he hoped that the police whom he had injured were going to die.

'His actions were of course determined, dreadful and carried out in real anger, directed at the officers who were trying to detain him. ‘

Haughton denies assault causing actual bodily harm to PC Alison Spruce in an earlier attack in Streatham on October 9, and also denies the attempted murder of PCs Thomas Harding, Alastair Hinchliff, Andrew Robb and Sham Haque and alternative counts of wounding each with intent.

He further denies causing actual bodily harm to PCs John Charlton and Barker, and attempting to cause grievous bodily harm to Sgt. David Weir.

The trial continues.
