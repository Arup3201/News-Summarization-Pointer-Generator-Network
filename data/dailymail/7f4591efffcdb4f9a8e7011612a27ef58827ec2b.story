Battler: Brave Jessica Vardy, with her mother Dawn, was given 10 months to live, but now she is on the road to recovery from a rare cancer

A little girl with a terminal tumour who was told she had just ten months to live is on the road to an amazing recovery after battling the rare cancer.

Jessica Vardy, five, was diagnosed with a Rhabdoid tumour under her left armpit which had spread through her arm on Christmas Eve.

Her parents had thought the mystery pain in her arm was a trapped nerve.

But five months later, doctors finally revealed Jessie had a cancerous tumour - and predicted she had just 10 months to live.

Only two children in the UK are diagnosed each year with the rare cancer, which usually spreads from the kidney or brain - prompting Jessie's grave prognosis.

But the brave little girl has continued to battle the cancer and after months of chemotherapy, she is defying the odds and going from strength to strength.

It has not spread to or from anywhere else in her body and the tumour has already reduced by 70 per cent.

And doctors will operate to remove as much of the tumour as possible next month - before ongoing chemotherapy is hoped to destroy it altogether.

Recovering: Jessica is described by her mother Dawn as 'our little miracle after fighting back against the cancer

Jessica's mum Dawn, 35, from Bishops Waltham, Hants, said: 'The pain of hearing the news that our daughter had a rare form of cancer, with little hope of survival, broke us to the core.

Treatment: Jessica in hospital where she has had months of chemotherapy that have reduced the tumour by 70 per cent

'You love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away.

'But our little girl has defied the odds and we are astounded that despite her consultants' fears, her tumour is actually shrinking.

'To be even talking about surgery and physiotherapy is amazing - especially considering we were told she wouldn't survive the year.

'It made us value our family and our time that we have together, we appreciate it more and we don't take it for granted.

'It has been a reminder of those things that are important.'

When Jessica left a summer fete with a mystery pain in her arm on the eve of her fifth birthday in July, Dawn thought she'd simply hurt it playing.

But as her agonising pain worsened over the following months, her loving family - who thought she had trapped a muscle - were left baffled.

They repeatedly returned to their GP as the pain killers did little to ease their little girl's suffering.

But it was not until Christmas Eve that Jessica was finally diagnosed with a tumour.

Dawn, who also has a eight-year-old son Josh, added: 'It got to the point where we were having her sleep in our bed as she was just in so much pain.

'I was told by doctors to give her pain relief medicine and to make sure she rested it. But when it got to Christmas Eve and she was still in agony, I just thought, 'I can't let her spend Christmas like this'.

'It was then a doctor noticed something wasn't right and told us it wasn't muscular and that we should take her to hospital straight away.

Devoted: Dawn and Jessica. 'You love your children more than anything and it was awful to know that someone you love so much could be taken away, 'she says

'They did an ultra sound and an MRI scan and that was when our whole world was turned upside down.'

Jessica was immediately put on a course of chemotherapy and radiotherapy at Southampton General Hospital in Hampshire.

Doctors have been amazed at how well she has responded to treatment. Her case is now being monitored by oncologists across Europe.

Dawn added: 'Jessie is a walking miracle and she has been so brave too. She coped so well with the injections, the needles, the chemotherapy and even losing her hair.

'It's been so hard on us all but we are getting there - and that's mostly thanks to the inspirational strength our little miracle Jessie has shown.'

Dawn's family and her friends are fundraising and have already raised Â£4,000 for the Piam Brown Ward in Southampton and Cancer Research UK.

They will also run Race for Life in Winchester next month and the Great South Run in Portsmouth in October.
