Two trains running on the same track collided head-on in southern Poland last night, killing 16 people and leaving 56 injured. 

The accident, which is the worst train disaster in Poland in more than 20 years, happened late last night on the Warsaw-Krakow mainline in the small town of Szczekociny.

President Bronislaw Komorowski said he would announce a period of national mourning for those killed.

Tragic: Fifteen people were killed and up to 50 injured when the two trains collided head-on late last night on the Warsaw-Krakow mainline in the small town of Szczekociny

Head-on collision: The crash happened after one of the trains ended up on the wrong side of the tracks and army helicopters were deployed to the scene to race the most seriously injured to hospital

Mangled wreck: Three coaches are reported to be especially damaged, and the rescue operation focused on finding passengers there, although rescue workers ended their search for the wounded early this morning

Investigation: Officials have said it is too early to say what had caused the crash and Polish prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the head-on collision happened

One of the dead was reported to be an American woman.

As the severity of the crash became known
army helicopters were deployed to the scene to race the most seriously 
injured to hospital while a fleet of 450 emergency vehicles, 100 
policemen and dozens of volunteer firemen clawed at the wreckage.

Officials have said it is too early to say what had caused the crash and Polish prosecutors have opened an investigation into how the head-on collision happened.

The two mangled trains, comprising 10 carriages in total, were carrying an estimated 350 passengers at the time of the crash.

Several of the passengers were foreigners, including people from Ukraine, Spain and France, but none of them appeared to be among the dead or badly injured.

A doctor in one of the hospitals, Szymon Nowak, said many of the injured were in a serious condition, with some in artificially induced comas.

Officials said they could not rule out finding more bodies as heavy machinery began the task of pulling apart the wreckage.

'After the rescue operation is over, I will take a decision about national mourning because it took place at the border of three provinces and the victims were from all over Poland,' said Mr Komorowski, who visited the scene today.

Shocking: Prime Minister Donald Tusk, left, called the 
accident the most tragic train catastrophe in Poland in recent years 
after visiting the site in the early hours of today as bodies were being retrieved from the wreckage

Surveying the damage: A fleet of 450 emergency vehicles, 100 policemen and dozens of volunteer firemen clawed at the wreckage

Three coaches are reported to be especially damaged, and the rescue operation focused on finding passengers there.

Rescue workers ended their search for the wounded and prosecutors opened their investigation early Sunday.

One passenger estimated that his train was travelling about 120km/h (75 mph), when it started braking very sharply.

'Then we felt a powerful impact, and we were thrown about the compartment,' the passenger told TVN24.

Andrzej Pawlowski, a member of the board of the state railway company PKP, said in an interview that one of the trains, which was traveling south from Warsaw to Krakow, should not have been on the track.

The other train, headed from the eastern city of Przemysl to Warsaw, was on the correct track, Mr Pawlowski said.

It wasn't immediately clear how the southbound train ended up on the wrong track.                          

Prime Minister Donald Tusk called the 
accident the most tragic train catastrophe in Poland in recent years 
after visiting the site in the early hours of today.

'Even more dramatic than the pictures are the facts,' Mr Tusk said. 'This is our most tragic train disaster in many, many years.'

David Cameron said tonight he was 'shocked and saddened' by the horrific crash and wrote to his counterpart Mr Tusk to express his sympathy over the horror smash.

In a letter to the Polish premier, Mr Cameron wrote: 'I was shocked and saddened by the news of last night's tragic train crash in Szczekociny.

'I have been following events closely, and wanted to send you and the families and friends of those killed my heartfelt sympathy and support at this very sad time. My thoughts are also with those who were injured in the crash and their loved ones.

'I also wanted to express my respect and support for the emergency workers who are involved in the difficult and complicated rescue efforts, and to you for your leadership of the national response.

'The British Government's thoughts and sympathies are with all who have been affected by this terrible tragedy.'

Mr Tusk arrived at the scene early this morning, with three other cabinet ministers and said it was too early to rule out human error.

Maintenance work was being carried out on one of the tracks where the collision occurred.

In 1990, 16 people were killed in a train crash in Warsaw.
