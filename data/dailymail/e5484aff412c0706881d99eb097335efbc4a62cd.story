Amanda Holden says that she has eschewed her Spanx after discovering yoga

It is something many women have probably done – find a style of dress that means you can fit into a size smaller than normal.

And Amanda Holden has admitted she is not immune – preferring Victoria Beckham dresses because she can wear an eight, whereas she would normally be a ten.

Yesterday, Holden, 43, revealed the brand is among her favourites, because its dresses come up bigger than usual.

It means she can have the satisfaction of believing she has fitted into a trimmer size than usual.

And coming just weeks after she revealed she had given up wearing Spanx underwear, it would seem Holden has found a canny new way of flattering her shape.

Giving an interview, the actress and Britain’s Got Talent judge said: ‘I love the fact that [Victoria Beckham’s] sizes are quite generous. I can happily fit into a Victoria Beckham size eight, when I actually think I’m more a size 10.’ 

She added: ‘I love Victoria. I’ve met her a few times and she’s funny and sparky and, I think, much misunderstood sometimes. I feel this strange connection to her even though I don’t really know her at all.

‘I’m thrilled that her fashion lines have been so successful because I’m sure there were a lot of people who would have loved to see her fall flat on her face. Her dresses are incredible and the pieces I’ve had, I just know I’m going to wear them forever or keep them for my girls.’

Amanda Holden has two daughters by her present husband record producer Chris Hughes who was also the former drummer for Adam and the Ants

Her girls are Lexi, eight, and two-year-old Hollie, from Holden’s second marriage to record producer and the former drummer for Adam and the Ants Chris Hughes, 60. Her first marriage, to the actor and comedian Les Dennis, 60, ended in divorce, after Holden had an affair with the actor Neil Morrissey, 51.

And giving an interview to this week’s Hello! magazine, Holden went on to describe her daughters as ‘girlie girls’, who have inherited their mother’s eye for fashion.

Holden said: ‘Hollie literally goes around the house with a crown on. I deliberately bought her a fire engine, a bus, a racing car so as not to stereotype her, but she goes around in a cape and tiara waving a wand. She loves playing with make-up. At the moment she’s into red lipstick – the slutty look.’ 

She added: ‘Lexi has such a good eye for putting an outfit together. I took her into Zara the other day to choose a new outfit and I looked at what she’d picked out and thought, “Wow, Lexi, you’ve got that spot on”.’

Earlier this year Holden revealed she had given up wearing Spanx – the shaping underwear which is popular for its ability to help flatten the stomach area – because she had found yoga.

And she told the magazine: ‘I was very open about my love of Spanx but by not eating cake every day and doing a bit of yoga, I’ve realised I can get away without them.

‘Also, I’m not the most graceful at getting out of cars and there were a few paparazzi shots of me where you could see them. It’s not a great look, is it? No one wants to see my sturdy trunks.’
