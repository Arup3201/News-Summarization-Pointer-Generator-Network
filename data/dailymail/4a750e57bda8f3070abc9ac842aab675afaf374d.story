Christians may have to sacrifice their jobs if they want to express their religion at work, government lawyers declared yesterday.

They urged human rights judges in Strasbourg to reject a landmark case brought by four Christians who said they suffered faith-based discrimination.

The state lawyers insisted workers 
are not entitled to wear a crucifix at work against the wishes of their 
employers – and if that is incompatible with their faith they ‘are free 
to resign’.

The hard line contrasts starkly with 
David Cameron telling the Commons in July that the right to wear the 
cross at work was ‘an absolutely vital freedom’.

He even pledged to change the law to ‘make clear that people can wear religious symbols at work.’

Last night the Government’s handling of the case was attacked by Christians for its ‘astonishing double standards’.

Government lawyers said the wearing 
of the crucifix was not a ‘scriptural requirement’ of Christianity, so 
employers had no obligation to recognise it.

But in a confrontation at the court 
yesterday, the Christians’ counsel said it was wrong they should have 
fewer rights than other faith groups just because they had a ‘tolerant’ 
religion.

The hearing at the European Court of 
Human Rights involved four test cases, two of which involve employees 
prevented from wearing a cross at work. Nadia Eweida’s row with British 
Airways led the airline to back down in 2006 and Shirley Chaplin who – 
after 30 years as a nurse – was told she could no longer wear her cross 
on duty for health and safety reasons.

Former Islington registrar Lilian Ladele, left, who was sacked after declining to conduct civil partnerships, and Shirley Chaplin, a nurse of 30 years who was told that she could no longer wear her cross to work, were also involved in yesterday's case in Strasbourg

The other two cases are those of 
Lilian Ladele, who was sacked as a registrar by Islington council 
because she declined to conduct civil partnerships and Gary McFarlane, a
 Relate counsellor who lost his job in Bristol after admitting to bosses
 that he felt unable to give sex therapy to gays.

The case comes at a time when senior 
Christian leaders, including the archbishops of the Church of England 
and the Pope, have complained that Christianity is being pushed out of 
public life in Britain.

Paul Diamond, for Mrs Chaplin and Mr 
McFarlane, said: ‘These are real people, real lives, real damage 
suffered. There is no knowing where this will end as society moves in a 
secular direction. The situation in the UK is now critical.’

But James Eadie QC, acting for the 
Government, told the judges that none of the four Christians had 
suffered any form of discrimination.

‘There is a difference between the 
professional sphere where your religious beliefs conflict with other 
interests and the private sphere,’ he said.

‘Everyone has the right to express 
their beliefs, including the right to display religious symbols, but not
 an absolute right or a right without limits. That does not mean that in
 their professional sphere anyone can manifest their religious belief in
 any way they choose.’ He said that under European human rights rules, 
people were allowed to practise their religion in a ‘generally 
recognised form’.

However, they could not ask to express their religion 
in ways which were not a ‘scriptural requirement’.

Prime Minister David Cameron told the House of Commons earlier this year that the right to wear the cross at work was 'an absolutely vital freedom'

He said: ‘Employees are free to 
resign if they find their employment incompatible with their religious 
beliefs’, adding: ‘They can obtain alternative employment in which they 
can reflect their religion as they wish.’
In the case of Miss Eweida, 61, from Twickenham, south-west London, 
wearing a cross was ‘a personal expression of faith and not a response 
to a scriptural command’.

Mrs Chaplin, 57, he added, had been 
told not to wear her cross because of new health and safety rules at 
Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital.

Of registrar Miss Ladele, Mr Eadie 
said Islington believed same-sex couples should have equal access to 
services and ‘this is a legitimate, even a weighty, aim for a public 
authority’. 

For Miss Eweida, James Dingemans said
 that BA allowed Muslims to wear hijabs, Sikhs to wear turbans and 
bracelets, and Jews to wear skull caps.

Last night Andrea Minichiello 
Williams of the Christian Legal Centre said: ‘The Government’s double 
standards in their handling of these four cases has been astonishing.

‘The PM says one thing to the media 
and in Parliament and yet shuns such statements at the most critical 
time, in legal submissions to the European Court of Human Rights.’

The court is likely to take several months before making a ruling.
