Ahead of its official naming by the Queen next Tuesday, P&O Cruises' new liner, the 141,000-ton Britannia, has arrived at its home port of Southampton.

Capable of carrying more than 3,600 passengers and 1,350 crew, the 1,082-ft long vessel is the largest cruise ship designed specifically for the British holiday market.

Boasting 15 passenger decks, 13 bars and 13 places to eat, the £473 million Britannia has a three-tier atrium, a 936-seater theatre, four swimming pools, and a multi-million pound art collection.

Passengers will be able to take part in a cookery school on board and there will be guest chefs on cruises, including Mary Berry. Marco Pierre White and James Martin.

Captains Paul Brown, who joined P&O Cruises in 1989, and David Pembridge, who has been with the company since 1972, will alternate being in command of Britannia.

Sailing from Southampton during the summer and operating from the Caribbean in the winter, Britannia will visit 57 ports in 31 countries in its first year, sailing more than 90,000 miles.

The naming ceremony takes place on Tuesday, hosted by none other than her majesty The Queen on Southampton Docks

Its maiden cruise, leaving Southampton on March 14, will be a 14-night Western Mediterranean sailing - with port stops including Barcelona, Monte Carlo and Rome.

Next Tuesday's naming ceremony, at which the Duke of Edinburgh will also be present, will prove particularly poignant for the Queen given her long and fond memories of another vessel called Britannia - the royal yacht that saw service from 1954 to 1997 before being decommissioned.
