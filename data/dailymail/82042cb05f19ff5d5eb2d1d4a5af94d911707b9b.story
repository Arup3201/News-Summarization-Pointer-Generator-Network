Plans for secret courts were resoundingly rejected by Liberal Democrat activists yesterday.

In a blow to leader Nick Clegg, they 
warned the party had ‘lost its soul’ when MPs and peers backed a Commons
Bill  for closed legal proceedings last week.

Two high-profile woman candidates quit
the party in disgust yesterday: Jo Shaw and Dinah Rose QC, who is a 
human rights barrister.

Principle: Human rights barrister Dinah Rose, left, and high flier Jo Shaw both resigned from the Liberal Democrats in disgust over the secret courts plan and accuse party leaders of supporting 'unfair bill'

Activists applauded when Miss Shaw, 
who is also a lawyer, announced her resignation on stage at the party 
conference in Brighton.

In an emotional speech, she said: 
‘It’s not me Nick, it’s you’, claiming that Mr Clegg had ‘abandoned 
liberal values for the privileges of power’.

She added: ‘The leadership of the 
Liberal Democrats has chosen to ignore party members, ride roughshod 
over party policy and support this unfair, unnecessary and unbalanced 
Bill.

‘The leadership has chosen to protect 
secrets and abuses of power over openness, accountability and freedom. I
cannot support such a leadership.’

Mr Clegg made no mention of the row in his keynote speech which brought the conference to a close at lunchtime

Outside the conference hall, Miss Shaw
told the Mail: ‘I love this party, I am dedicated to this party but I 
cannot continue under this leader. This bill runs contrary to what we 
are about; fair trials and the ability to hold power to account.’

A female activist accused Miss Shaw of
betraying her party, saying: ‘I have lost respect for you … resigning 
like that in the open. There will pages of it in the papers tomorrow, 
saying how rubbish we are.’

During an emergency debate yesterday, 
former Cambridge Lib Dem MP, David Howarth, said it was wrong for the 
Government to claim that secret courts would affect only ‘civil 
proceedings’.

He added: ‘The Bill does nothing to 
help the secret services gain more information to foil terror plots. All
it does is give them an unfair advantage in cases where they are 
accused of kidnap and torture.’

Emotions also ran high on the issue 
during a question and answer session with Mr Clegg on Saturday. Three 
out of ten questions asked concerned secret courts, as delegates became 
increasingly frustrated with the party leader’s answers.

One told him the legislation was ‘illiberal’ and warned that members could not support it.

Mr Clegg said he understood the strong
feelings about the issue but it would be impossible to block it in the 
face of support from the Tories and Labour.

‘Please don’t allege that this 
Government, with Liberal Democrats in it, is doing something abhorrently
illiberal, which we are not,’ he insisted.

The Government’s Justice and Security Bill passed its third reading, despite a rebellion by Tory MPs and a handful of Lib Dems.

Ministers say civil claims against the
state involving terror suspects and armed forces should be held behind 
closed doors as too often the Government pays out millions of pounds to 
settle claims to prevent secret intelligence from being revealed. Former
Tory leadership contender David Davis said: ‘Gladstone must be spinning
in his grave. Let’s be clear – given the majority for secret courts in 
the House of Commons, it is the Liberal Democrats who have delivered 
them.’

Shami Chakrabarti, director of 
Liberty, said: ‘Jo Shaw is a rising political star and a member of the 
Lib Dem federal executive. Losing her should feel like losing your soul 
and reflects a loss of human rights values at the top of the party.’

Miss Rose represented former 
Guantánamo Bay detainee Binyam Mohamed in his case against the British 
intelligence services. He won a massive payout.

Nick Clegg, pictured today, defended his handling of the issue in a bad-tempered question and answer session last night, when he claimed the plans were backed by the Tories and Labour so he was powerless to stop them
