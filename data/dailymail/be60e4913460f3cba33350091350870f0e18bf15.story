Barack Obama last night returned to New York City for a $40,000-a-head fundraising dinner which was expected to bring rush hour traffic to a standstill.

The trip came just six weeks after a star-studded event at Sarah Jessica Parker's house in Manhattan which raised $4.5million for the President's re-election campaign.

It is unclear how the trip, which saw Mr Obama fly to New York on Air Force One and official helicopter Marine One, is being paid for.

The President's jaunt has been attacked by the state Republican Party, who described Mr Obama as the 'Campaigner-in-Chief' and urged him to focus on 'job creation and economic growth' rather than November's election.

Air Force One touched down at JFK airport shortly before 5pm on Monday, and Mr Obama shook the hands of young New Yorkers who had gathered on the runway to watch him arrive.

He was then whisked to Manhattan on Marine One, before travelling by motorcade to the exclusive NoMad Hotel in the city's Flatiron District.

There he addressed an audience of 60 wealthy donors around 8pm, in an event believed to have raised $2.4million for his election battle with Republican Mitt Romney.

Mr Obama returned to Washington DC at 10pm.

During the dinner, the President told
donors he thought he was likely to win the election, but stressed the 
need to keep up with Mr Romney's campaign spending.

'If the election were held today, I think it'd be close, but I think we'd win,' Mr Obama said.

He described his administration's 
efforts to boost the struggling economy but admitted: 'Right now, the 
economy is still rough enough for enough people that this is going to be
a close election.'

Mr Obama added that big-spending 
super PACs 'are engaging in an experiment that we have not seen in 
American democracy for quite some time. They are spending like nobody's 
business and focusing on negative ads.'

He said the Democrats do not have to 
match that spending dollar-for-dollar, 'but we do have to make sure that
we can get our message out effectively.'

The President is required for security reasons to travel on official aircraft with a large Secret Service following.

When he is campaigning, the Democratic Party usually reimburses the cost of the travel to the taxpayer.

However,
in the past Mr Obama has frequently combined fundraising trips with his
official duties, meaning that the government shares the cost with his 
campaign.

Republicans 
have been persistently critical of the President's fundraising schedule,
arguing that he should instead concentrate on boosting the economy.

Ed Cox, chairman of the New York State Republican Party, said: 'Once again, we wish the President were here to discuss job creation and economic growth, but it appears he's "got a lot on his plate".

'It's been six months since President Obama's Jobs Council last met publicly - during which time he's attended well over 100 fundraisers and played 11 rounds of golf.

'Instead of focusing on creating jobs, the Campaigner-in-Chief is focused on saving his own with a $40,000 per person fundraiser tonight at a ritzy Manhattan hotel.'

In June, Mr Obama went to Manhattan for a pair of campaign events which raised a total of $4.5million.

One was hosted by Sarah Jessica Parker and Anna Wintour at the Sex and the City star's home, while another was at the Plaza Hotel and featured a performance by Mariah Carey.
