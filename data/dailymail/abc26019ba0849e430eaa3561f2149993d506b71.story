Three months after travelling to Munich to watch Real Madrid play their Champions League semi-final second leg against Bayern Munich, James Rodriguez described his £60million move to the Spanish giants as a dream come true.

In May, the Colombia international posed for a picture with Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Madrid’s 4-0 win at the Allianz Arena, and then during the World Cup – where he won the Golden Boot with six goals in five games – the 23-year-old said: ‘It is a dream of mine to play in Spain, Madrid is my favourite team.’

‘This is something I have always dreamed about,’ Rodriguez said in his first official interview since moving to Madrid. ‘I always wanted to join this club and I hope to be happy here for a long time to come and to help the club win a lot more titles.'

The attacker was Colombia’s star as they sparkled at the World Cup in Brazil, before being knocked out at the quarter-final stage by the host nations – during which Rodriguez was fouled repeatedly in an attempt to stop him playing his usual game.

Despite the intimidation tactics Rodriguez still scored, a late penalty to make the score 2-1.

'Last month was incredible. I always wanted to come here and Madrid have shown an interest in me and have done everything so that I could be here. I am delighted because it is something I have always longed and wished for.'

On his unveiling in front of thousands of fans at the Santiago Bernabeu, he said: 'It was very special. It is a day I will never forget. I will always hold onto that memory fondly.

'I felt really happy [hearing Madrid fans chant my name] because it is something I have always dreamed about. Ever since I was a boy I always wanted to be in this great stadium, an historic stadium. It was great and I hope that I play lots of matches here.'

Rodriguez admitted that his whole family are fans of los Blancos. 'They have always supported the team and now even more,’ he said. ‘The whole of Colombia will be more into Real Madrid now, for sure.

'I admire Cristiano Ronaldo a lot, as I do the rest of the team. They are star names and to be by the side of these great players is an honour for me.

‘I hope to be able to win lots of titles with them, that is what we all want.

'I can provide goals, passes and good play. I am just one more player and I want to help out so that Madrid picks up wins and also titles.'

Colombia has more of  Real Madrid Foundation's social developmental and sport schools than any other country, and Rodriguez thinks his move to Spain will increase the team’s popularity back home.

'Colombians have always loved this team and now that I'm here, they will support Madrid even more. All 45 million Colombians will definitely be Real Madrid fans.'

The 23-year-old also took the opportunity to pay his respects to Real Madrid legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, who was an important figure for Real Madrid as well as in Colombia, having played there during his career.

'He was a very special person for Colombia, just as he was here. He made history here and there. He is a great man who we will never forget.'
