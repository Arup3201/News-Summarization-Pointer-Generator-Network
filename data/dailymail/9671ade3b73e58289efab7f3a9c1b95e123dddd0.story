Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Blaise Matuidi believes his side's 4-1 win over Lens on Saturday night was the perfect preparation for their Champions League last-16 second leg against Chelsea.

The French champions recorded their 15th league win of the season to regain first place - if only temporarily due to Lyon's game in hand - and Matuidi is confident that a positive result has set them up nicely for a trip to London.

'It was very important to go top of the table, even if it's only provisional. It's a good way to prepare for the Champions League match against Chelsea on Wednesday,' he told reporters.

'We are heading to London with plenty of confidence. I think we can still do better in terms of converting our chances into goals, but we're working on it.

'Wednesday's match will be a very tough one against a team full of confidence. But we're heading there to qualify.'

The first leg of the tie, at Parc des Princes, saw Chelsea take the lead through Branislav Ivanovic, before Edinson Cavani equalised in the second half to salvage the tie.

Laurent Blanc's side will know that they need to score in west London to have any chance of progressing, but the tie is firmly in the balance going into the decider.
