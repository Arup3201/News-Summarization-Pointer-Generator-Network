Salford chairman Marwan Koukash is to give fans a say in the running of the Super League club.

The millionaire racehorse owner, an innovative, hands-on chairman of the Red Devils, is turning his back on the traditional board of directors by forming an advisory panel comprising 12 season-ticket holders to help make future plans for the club.

Koukash said: 'I firmly believe that the people at the top of our game do not spend enough time listening to the people whose views matter the most - the supporters.

'This is not just a PR exercise, I promise you that. The people that are chosen will help me reach meaningful decisions on the subjects that directly affect this club.'

The club want fans to apply for the role by kick-off ahead of their home game against Catalan Dragons on Friday.
