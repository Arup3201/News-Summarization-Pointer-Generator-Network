The head of the BBC has admitted he thinks the television ‘watershed’ is doomed.

Director General Tony Hall openly declared what many viewers have long feared – that the days of the 9pm cut-off are numbered.

The watershed - designed to prevent children being exposed to violence, sex and swearing – has been appreciated by families for decades.

But now Lord Hall has confessed: ‘The watershed is still a useful way of judging the content and sensitivities, and taste and decency issues. But has the watershed got a future in 20 or 30 years’ time? I suspect not.’

There has been mounting concern that the 9pm cut-off is being abolished by stealth, with explicit content increasingly aired earlier in the evening.

In particular, series such as The X Factor and Britain’s Got Talent have been criticised for screening raunchy early-evening performances by singers such as Jennifer Lopez and Rihanna. 

There are also worries about music videos that are available online and can be viewed by children of any age.

In a wide-ranging interview in this week’s Radio Times, Lord Hall was asked about violence towards women in drama The Fall and a recent rape storyline in EastEnders, which is broadcast earlier than the watershed.

He said: ‘EastEnders has been rejuvenated over the past year, and if that was all we did, I can understand the point, but at the same time we’re doing dramas like Esio Trot, Wolf Hall. 

'There’s a range of drama and it’s right that our dramas look at very tough issues in a way that is sensitive. If [violence against women] was the entirety of what we did, I would be concerned, but it’s not.’

In recent months, media campaign groups have warned of a ‘slippery slope’, with increasingly adult themes featuring in pre-watershed programmes.

The BBC featured a nude dominatrix in its hit detective drama Sherlock 25 minutes before the watershed.

The watershed was introduced in 1964 and broadcasters came under increasing pressure to abide by it by campaigners such as Mary Whitehouse, who was ridiculed by some as being out of touch after she railed against broadcasters and artists whose work she felt was obscene.

In 1965 she founded the National Viewers’ and Listeners’ Association, using it as a platform to criticise the BBC for its perceived lack of accountability and excessive portrayals of sex, violence and bad language.

At the time, she was loathed by liberals such as then BBC Director General Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, whom she once called the ‘devil incarnate’.

Lord Hall confessed this week: ‘The watershed is still a useful way of judging the content and sensitivities, and taste and decency issues. But has the watershed got a future in 20 or 30 years’ time? I suspect not’

But since her death aged 91 in 2001, a growing number of commentators have said her views on the dangers of broadcasting gratuitous sex and violence had been ahead of their time.

In 2010 veteran broadcaster Dame Joan Bakewell, who fought for a new liberal age of freedom, admitted that she had come to agree with her one-time bête noire.

And last month actress Julie Walters agreed too – saying she had been wrong to dismiss Mrs Whitehouse’s ideas in the 1970s.

Last year, broadcasting watchdog Ofcom, in charge of monitoring the watershed, said a survey showed a record 78 per cent support for the 9pm cut-off.

It comes amid concerns by media campaign groups that there are already increasingly adult themes featuring in certain pre-watershed programmes
