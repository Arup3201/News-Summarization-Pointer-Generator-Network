The family of a mother and wife killed in the AirAsia disaster are struggling to come to terms with the last words she uttered before boarding the plane, in which she said she would 'spend time alone at sea' for her birthday.

When fashion store owner The Meiji Thejakusuma bid goodbye to her relatives before boarding AirAsia's Flight 8501, she quipped she would 'spend time alone at sea' on her upcoming  birthday, which she planned to mark with a luxury cruise.

But 40 minutes after takeoff, the plane crashed into the sea off the island of Borneo in a disaster believed to have killed all 162 people on board.

On January 3, when she would have turned 45 on the celebratory cruise visiting Malaysia and Thailand, her body was instead being returned to her family in Surabaya, Indonesia, after it was recovered from the Java Sea.

Her nephew Eric Edi Santo, a cafe owner, has now relayed his aunt's haunting last words to him as he spoke at the funeral parlour where a vigil was being held, attended by abound 100 friends and relatives.

He said: 'We asked her how are you going to celebrate your birthday. She said jokingly: "I'll spend time alone at sea".

'Maybe God was trying to be good to her, and didn't want her to spend her birthday alone at sea, so he brought her back.'

Thejakusuma got on the plane in her home city of Surabaya on December 28 with her husband, mother, three children and prospective son-in-law.

They were headed for Singapore where they would start their cruise, but 40 minutes later disaster struck and the aircraft crashed into the water.

Her body, and that of her 10-year-old daughter Stevie, are among the 37 that have so far been recovered, with teams still searching for the remains of the other 125 passengers, most of them Indonesian.

They include Thejakusuma's 48-year-old husband Jie Charly Gunawan, her mother Jo Indri, 82, and her two other children, 19-year-old Steven and Stephanie, 28.

Stephanie's fiance Christanto Leoma Hutama was also with them.

Her nephew added: Mr Santo said: 'We hope for a survivor... at least just one of them. I hope that one of them can come back alive.'

'If not, we hope that all of their bodies at least will be here, we don't want any missing bodies. They died so tragically, at least I want them to have a proper burial.'

Thejakusuma was the owner of clothes store 'Planet One' in Surabaya, and was known for being hard-working and humble despite her own affluence, said another of her nephews, Agus Panjaya.

A devout Buddhist, she regularly made financial contributions to her local temple as well as to orphanages, and she was always quick to help her relatives.

Panjaya recalled when he was still at high school and living in a dormitory in the east Java city of Malang, when his aunt and uncle would take turns to drive two hours at weekends to visit him and take him sightseeing around the city.

'They did not want me to feel lonely,' he said. 'It was in my aunt's character to just help people whenever she could, poor people, her own family, anyone. That's why everyone feels a deep sense of loss.'

Meanwhile, strong currents have forced Indonesia to expand the search area for the crashed plane, as rough seas and bad weather moved debris and made it difficult to reach suspected chunks of the fuselage on the ocean floor.

With only a fraction of the bodies recovered since the crash, there are also concerns that it will become harder to find the remaining victims.

'Time is of the essence,' said the National Search and Rescue Agency's director of operation, Suryadi B Supriyadi. 'But it seems like it is hard to beat the weather.'

The search operation will expand by about 71 square miles (185 sq km).

Sonar has identified five large objects which are believed to be pieces of the fuselage on the ocean floor, but strong currents, silt and mud have prevented divers from seeing or reaching the objects.

No pings have been detected from the plane's all-important cockpit voice and flight data recorders, because high waves have prevented the deployment of ships which drag ping locators, but the black box may have been located after an Indonesian naval ship discovered what is believed to be the tail section of the doomed jet.

The tail is where the crucial data recorder is located and holds the key to finding out what happened to the Airbus when it crashed on December 28.

The batteries in the pingers on the black boxes are likely to die in about 20 more days.
