Banned: Gosport mayor Wayne Ronayne and his partner Paula Carter have been banned from the town's pubs following alcohol-fuelled celebrations just hours after they were sworn in to their new roles

A new mayor and mayoress have been barred from all the pubs in their town following alcohol-fuelled celebrations just hours after they were sworn in to their new roles.

Tory councillor Wayne Ronayne and partner Paula Carter were ordered out of one pub and barred entry to a second in Gosport, Hampshire.

Ms Carter, 54, is alleged to have shouted ‘Don’t you know who I am?’ and threatened to use her new powers to shut down the first pub as she was escorted out.

Both pubs complained and Mayor Ronayne, 54, has now been given a six-month ban by the town's Pub Watch from 36 establishments in Gosport. Ms Carter has been barred for 12 months.

Police were called to the Wetherspoons Star pub in Gosport just hours after the couple had been sworn in to their new prestigious public roles.

It is thought an argument broke out when staff asked the boozy party to leave.

As they were being removed Ms Carter allegedly threatened to get the pub closed down.

The group left and tried to enter the nearby Nelson's Bar but were refused and the mayoress reportedly made a similar threat to bouncers - and even asked 'do you know who I am?'

Stephen Brown, duty manager at Nelson's, said: 'She said to me "do you know who I am?".

'I said "no, I don't" and she said "I'm the mayoress of Gosport I can have you closed down".

'I politely said she still wouldn’t be coming in, she was clearly drunk and then continued to be rude and had to be dragged away by one of the other members.'

Nelson's owner, Arthur Caraccio, has released CCTV footage of Ms Carter arguing with staff and doormen.

He
 said: 'We’ve just spent a lot of money making this place nice, and I’m 
not having anyone come and threaten my business, especially not some 
jumped-up Mayor’s wife.

'It’s the sort of behaviour we wouldn’t tolerate from anybody, let alone public servants.

'They’re meant to hold themselves up as a standard for the type of behaviour they want to see.

'If the Mayor of Gosport is a drunk, that says a lot about the town.'

Drinker Richard Horn, 34, saw police arrive and ask the group to leave.

He said: 'Gosport’s got a bad enough reputation through historical things without this making it even worse.'

Gosport Pub Watch are now going to speak to the borough council about the shocking incident.

Chairman Phil Cox said: 'Everybody is treated the same.

'People need to be treating licensees and staff with respect.

Scene: The group were refused entry to the nearby Nelson's Bar, when the mayoress reportedly asked 'do you know who I am?'

'But we don’t expect the mayor of Gosport, who represents our town, to be involved in incidents like this.'

Mayor Ronayne has branded the claims 'absolute nonsense', and said he was not aware that any ban had been put in place.

He did not respond to MailOnline's request for comment today, but said at the weekend: 'I’m not aware of that at this point of time. 

'I’m unaware of anything that happened.'

Gosport's Lib-Dem leader Cllr Peter Chegwyn said: 'It’s unbelievable. He should resign as mayor and from the council.'

Tory leader Cllr Mark Hook said Pub Watch had acted as 'judge and jury' but believes the mayor and mayoress need 'to do a lot of soul searching' over their future.

Gosport Borough Council has declined to comment on the allegations.

Former serviceman Mayor Ronayne worked in the Fleet Air Arm (FAA) of the Royal Navy for 34 years before being elected to local council in May 2010 and becoming deputy mayor last year.

In the May 22 election, he narrowly retained his seat in the Christchurch Ward, by just 16 votes.

not having anyone come and threaten my business, especially not some 
jumped-up Mayor’s wife'

Mayor Ronayne bills himself as a 'family man' with three sons on the Gosport Conservatives website, and reveals he has a Masters in Leadership and Management.

He adds: 'My main field of expertise is the development, leadership and management of "people".

'This being gained from my long experience of maintaining and improving the morale and effectiveness of naval personnel.

'My current mission is to fully utilise the superb training and experience I gained as a servicemen to improve and maintain the quality of life for the people of Gosport in all areas of the community.'

The Mayor of Gosport website, Mayor Ronayne’s personal Facebook page and his partner’s Facebook accounts have been taken down following the incident.

Locals took to social media to blast the Mayor and his partner for 'dragging down' Gosport, after last Wednesday’s behaviour.

In a post on the Star's Facebook page Mr Horn said: 'It’s so disappointing to see people who represent Gosport, who should be setting an example, drag it down.'

He added: 'Everyone desires to let they hair down and relax - I agree, but people should not be abusive to staff who are just doing a job.

'People in public office, or in the public eye, need to have a private life too - I agree, but when you mention who you are and your title then you are back “on duty” and in this case representing the Mayor of Gosport’s office.

'I sincerely hope that the actions of these representatives of Gosport Borough Council do not take away from the hard work that a lot of local civil servants do.

'I’m sure JD Wetherspoons will back they staff 100 per cent and congratulate them for having to deal with this incident in the professional way they did.'

Jason Searle wrote: 'Need him gone for sure!'

Brian Grimmet added: 'After the disgraceful behaviour of the Mayor and Mayoress.

'These people are not fit to hold office.'
