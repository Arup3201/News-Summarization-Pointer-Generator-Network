Arrested: Wanted fugitive Brian Thexton, 37, has been detained by police in an isolated rural property in Cumbria

One of Britain's most wanted fugitives who is accused of being involved in a string of robberies has been arrested.

Brian Thexton, 37, was detained by Cumbria Police at an isolated rural property near Kirkby Stephen shortly before 8pm yesterday.

Thexton, from Durham, was recently highlighted by Crimestoppers as one of the country's most wanted fugitives.

He is accused of being involved in robberies where a gang would tie up homeowners and force them to give up alarm codes and safe combinations.

In one robbery, the gang impersonated police officers to dupe the victims into opening the door, before brandishing a pick axe handle and a baseball bat.

Thexton is also awaiting trial for conspiracy to supply cocaine, over claims that he was the middleman in the sale of half a kilo of the drug, and had admitted conspiring to steal cars and machinery.

Police had been hunting for the wanted criminal in Lancashire after he was sighted in a car on Aberdeen Road, Lancaster, earlier this month.

A police officer told him to pull over, then walked over to the car and reached into the vehicle to remove the keys from the ignition.

A Lancashire Police spokesman said the car was then driven away, trapping the officer's arm and dragging him a short distance down the road. The officer freed himself before he was seriously injured.

Wanted: Robert Mortby, 26, is sought by police on suspicion of attempted murder over an attack on a man outside a pub in Elephant and Castle, south London.

David Mather, 57, from Manchester, was convicted of conspiracy to import heroin and sentenced to 18 years in his absence. Caught after a lorry containing 32 packets of the drug stuffed in the bumper was stopped at Humber sea terminal

Lee Willis, 30, from Ashton Under Lyne admitted possessing cocaine and cannabis in March this year but went on the run before he was due to be sentenced in June. He is also accused of dealing the class A drug

Robert Knight, 52, from Walsall, is accusing of helping to arrange for 6kg of cocaine to be smuggled to Heathrow Airport from the Dominican Republic in 2008. Five others have been arrested and charged

Daniel Dugic, 32, from Serbia, is accused of trying to smuggle cocaine into the UK. He allegedly plotted a deal where a boat would meet a container ship in the English Channel to collect 255kg of the drug

Police said the car was then driven away at speed and was found a short time later having been set on fire on Fernham Carr Lane.

Detective Superintendent Andrew Slattery said last night: 'Detectives from Cumbria Constabulary have worked hard with other police forces in the North of England over recent weeks to track down and arrest Thexton.

'After a uniformed policing operation tonight he was detained without incident at an isolated rural property.

'We would like to thank the community of North Cumbria for their support and can assure them that our county is not and will not become a safe haven for organised criminals.'

Thexton was on a list issued by the charity Crimestoppers, the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), and Spanish police in Madrid earlier this month of 13 of Britain's most wanted criminals thought to be hiding in Spain.

The list was published as part of Operation Captura, a scheme to trace criminals who are thought to have fled to Spain.

Keith Turner, 60, from Northumbria (pictured, left, in his early 40s and, right, in an artist's impression of him aged 57) is sought by police for four offences of obtaining property by deception. He was released on licence in 1993 after serving 20 years in jail for the manslaughter of his mother and sister

Daniel Bowes, 43, from London, was allegedly a senior figure in a cocaine smuggling ring, acting as a go-between for the head of the gang with contacts and delivery drivers. He is wanted on suspicion of conspiracy to supply cocaine

Christopher Mealey, 37, from London, is accused of being a member of the same cocaine smuggling ring as Daniel Bowes. The gang was allegedly involved in smuggling the Class A drug from the Netherlands to the UK
