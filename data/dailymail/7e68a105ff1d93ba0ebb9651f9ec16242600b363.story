A Nobel Peace Prize has sold for a staggering $1.16million after being unearthed in a South American pawn shop - more than 11 times what experts estimated it would fetch.

The gold medal - only the second Nobel Peace Prize ever to be sold at auction and the first in the United States - was originally awarded to Argentina's Foreign Minister Carlos Saavedra Lamas in 1936, for his role in ending the Chaco War between Paraguay and Bolivia.

Brian Kendrella, president of New York-based Stack's Bowers Galleries, which oversaw the medal's sale at the Whitman Expo conference, in Baltimore, yesterday, said the auction drew half a dozen bidders from six countries.

Much of the history of the 1936 Nobel Peace Prize is shrouded in mystery and has sold to an unknown buyer

Carlos Saavedra Lamas was the first Latin American to receive the Nobel Peace Prize

The winning bid, which came in via phone, was from and individual collector from Asia who asked to remain anonymous.

The prize sold for $950,000 but buyer's commission brought the final price to $1.16 million.

This is only the second Nobel Peace 
Prize to come to auction. This award marked the first time someone from 
Latin America received the honor. The 1936 recipient was Argentina's 
foreign minister, Carlos Saavedra Lamas.

Engraved on the side of the medal is the year it was awarded, the recipients name and the words 'Nobel Peace Prize' in French.

The prize sold for far more than the gallery's estimate of $50,000 to $100,000.

John Kraljenich, a consultant who worked with Stack's Bowers to verify and value the coin, said the publicity drove up the value astronomically.

He said: 'The fact that it went internationally viral and people who are not experts or collectors knew about mean meant that we knew it could easily hit seven figures.'

Mr Kraljenich was called in to verify the authenticity of the medal, something he said was easy to do.

Carlos Saavedra Lamas, born in Buenos 
Aires in 1878, was the first Latin American to be awarded the Nobel 
Peace Prize. There have since been four more recipients from the region,
 most recently Guatemalan campaigner Rigoberta Menchú Tum in 1992.

Mr
 Lumas was made his country's foreign minister in 1932 and held the post
 for six years. When he was appointed, he immediately began work to end 
the war that was raging between Paraguay and Bolivia and, after years to
 treaties and diplomacy, brought the conflict to a negotiated end in 
1935 - by this point, up to 130,000 people had been killed.

He died in 1959, at the age of 80, from a brain hemorrhage.

'It all checked out and everything was as it should be, after 20 or 30 years in this business you can tell if something is fake after about 15 seconds.'

He said was a particularly exciting piece to work on.

'This is the most valuable medal that I've gotten to catalogue for auction, it's definitely top of the pyramid in terms of value.'

Little is known about what happened to
 the medal after Mr Lumas's death in 1959. In 1993, the person who owned
 the prize sold it to an unknown South American pawn shop, receiving 
only the value of its gold - the 222.4g of the 23-carat precious metal 
that makes up the medal would be worth $9,168 (£5,490) on today's 
market.

It has passed 
through the hands of two collectors over the last two decades before 
turning up for auction yesterday. Before its sale, it was part of the 
Charles A Wharton Collection that was being sold off after its owner's 
death.

The only other 
Nobel Peace Prize known to have sold at auction was the medal awarded to
 English MP Sir William Randal Cremer in 1903. It was sold at Sotheby's,
 London, in 1985 for £11,550 ($17,440).

The medal was awarded in recognition of Mr Lamas's work to end the Chaco War that raged from 1932-1935

The medal is only the second Nobel Peace Prize to be sold at action - the first was in London in 1985
