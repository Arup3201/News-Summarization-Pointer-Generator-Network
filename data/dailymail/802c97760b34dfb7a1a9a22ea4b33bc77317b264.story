As a child, my ambition was to be a ballerina. I would stand on tiptoes and twirl around in the mirror imagining myself leaping across the stage at the Royal Ballet to the crowd's rapturous applause.

But soon after starting dance classes, it became crushingly obvious that no matter how adroit my pirouette, I would never be Giselle. Where my fellow dancers' legs were long and lithe, mine were short by comparison.

I had to give up my dreams of ballet stardom and went into contemporary dance instead. It was an early lesson in having to make the best of what I had. Even now at 70, despite being under 5ft 3in, I always try to make the most of my legs because I've been so painfully aware of their, well, shortcomings.

It doesn't help that I have gained weight over the past two years. I used to be very strict with my diet, cutting out carbohydrates, but recently I've relaxed a bit and started eating the things I love - cheese, chocolate and pasta. I've gone up from a size eight to a size 12, which is quite a lot for my height, and it means I have to dress even more cleverly, because some outfits - like the one pictured I wore last September - can make me look dumpy.

If you've ever seen me judging, you'll know I never give very high marks. But I do think some of these outfits, selected by the Mail's fashion editor Eliza Scarborough, work wonders.

ARLENE SAYS: The Duchess of Cambridge has fabulous legs, but there's a reason she often wears nude heels. Paired with matching tights, they can make your legs look up to six inches longer because you trick the eye into seeing the shoe as part of the leg. Meanwhile the dark side panels on this dress have the effect of whittling down the waist. 9/10

Eliza says: It's not just the shoe's colour that matters - the style can also affect how long your legs look. Avoid ankle-strap or T-bar shoes, which will cut your leg off at the ankle and cost you inches.

ARLENE
 SAYS: This reminds me of the ballet dress I wore to teach in, and I'd 
forgotten what a flattering look it is.

It has a lovely, flirty swing 
and makes my legs look like they start from my waist.

And with this 
neckline, I'm well aware my best asset is my bosom rather than my legs! 
     6/10 

Eliza says: The wide flare is an optical illusion, making 
the legs look longer, and the floaty edge doesn't cut your legs off 
halfway up, as a pencil skirt would.

ARLENE
 SAYS: Instead of accentuating my natural waistline, this dress gives me
 a waist just under my bust, which has the effect of making my top half 
shorter and my bottom half longer. Usually, I avoid horizontal stripes 
in case they give me extra width. But the dark panels at the side mean 
the overall effect here is slimming. However, the stripes don't make me 
feel totally confident.        6/10

Eliza says: If you're short, 
avoid clothes that accentuate your natural waist. The higher your 
waistline, the longer the legs appear.

ARLENE SAYS: Oh yes. This is my favourite. The soft, stretchy, clingy crepe fits perfectly to the body but gives a long, smooth line.

Because you can't see my knees, it gives the illusion mine could be higher than they are! And the skirt shows off every inch of lower leg. Perfect. 10/10

Eliza says: Covering your knees gives the impression your legs go up higher than they do. But don't let hems fall too low - a mid-calf skirt can look grannyish if you're lacking in height.

ARLENE SAYS: To lengthen the leg, match your shoe colour to your trousers. Then the eye travels from the top of your leg to the floor. This gives the impression that my waistline is higher than it is. And if these trousers had been in black or white, I'd have been in heaven, but I'm not crazy about the bright blue.        5/10

ELIZA SAYS: As well as colour-matching trousers and shoes, choose a slim, tapered-leg trouser. Trousers that are wide at the bottom, like a boot-cut or flare, will make your legs look shorter - no matter how high your heels.
