Dressed to impress: Ecuador fans pose with their tickets

Managers:  Ottmar Hitzfield (Switzerland) and Reinaldo Rueda (Ecuador)Key clash: Enner Valencia v Valon Behrami

The lesser-known Valencia impressed during Ecuador’s friendly against England last week and could be Rueda’s side’s breakout star in Brazil. Behrami, formerly of West Ham, will be expected to drop back from central midfield and pick up the pacey attacker when Ecuador break. One to watch: Ricardo Rodriguez (Switzerland)

The Wolfsburg left-back is one of Europe’s hottest properties following a brilliant season in the Bundesliga. Equally adept defensively as he is going forward, the 21-year-old will be looking to register his first international goal during the World Cup. Head-to-head record: Played 0

Key man: Switzerland's Ricardo Rodriguez will be a key man

Team News:

Switzerland coach Ottmar Hitzfeld has warned his side against complacency as they prepare to start their World Cup campaign in Group E against Ecuador in Brasilia on Sunday.

Veteran Hitzfeld has overseen a remarkable resurgence for his side, who qualified for the finals without losing a game and have been defeated just twice in 18 games over the last two years.

Switzerland's serene progress towards Brazil is in stark contrast to their opponents, who squeezed into the final South American qualifying spot and have been hit by the loss of Segundo Castillo due to injury.

And despite his unstinting conviction that his young side has it in them to go as far as the quarter-finals, Hitzfeld has acknowledged they must avoid suffering a slip-up in their Sunday opener.

Despite their far from seamless qualification process, Ecuador will take some comfort from a 2-2 draw with England in their final warm-up game.

But injury issues are not far away with Dynamo Moscow midfielder Christian Noboa the latest to be rendered a doubt for the Switzerland opener as he struggles to recover from a muscle complaint.

Head to head: Ecuador forward Enner Valencia will come up against Switzerland's Valon Behrami
