It's been going for just three days and 115 miles but the Olympic Torch Relay has already burnt out, organisers confirmed today.

Shortly before 10am the torch that was attached to the side of Para-badminton star David Follett's wheelchair went out during his leg of the relay in Great Torrington, Devon.

But just up the road in Hatherleigh, an extremely unofficial torch kept burning despite the wind.

Looking rather perilous against a row of thatched cottages, the flaming fireball on a stick was paraded through the small market town in the locally organised event.

Back in Great Torrington, a spokeswoman for LOCOG said: 'The flame went out due to a malfunctioning burner.

Retired farmer Tony Hill is 64 years late for his Olympic Torch Relay duties.

The 86-year-old from Wiveliscombe, Devon, had been due to carry the flame ahead of the 1948 London Games but was struck down with appendicitis.

As the torch came through Taunton in Somerset that year he was on the operating table.

But today a healthy Mr Hill held the golden torch aloft during his leg of the relay through Barnstaple in Devon. It had been 'an honour' he said.

Speaking about missing out in 1948, Mr Hill added: 'I was in the Southern Counties cross-country championships in Kent a few days before and collapsed with appendicitis.

'I never thought I'd get another chance when I was in East Reach Hospital on the day I was meant to be carrying the torch in 1948.'

'It is not uncommon for a flame to go out and this can happen for a number of reasons, for example, in extreme winds.

'A replacement torch was brought out from the convoy of vehicles and was lit from the mother flame.

'We keep the mother flame in specially designed miners' lanterns so if the flame does go out for some reason on the relay we relight it from the source of the flame,' the spokeswoman added.

Mr Follett was left paralysed at 19 when he was struck by a car. But after returning to college to complete his A Levels he looked at what sports were available to wheelchair athletes and helped to set up a badminton club.

With his playing partner, Follett has been unbeaten for three years in the four nations competitions and he is now the Para-badminton world No 1 in his class.

The torch relay entered its third day today and will see dozens of unsung and hard-working individuals get their moment in the spotlight as they carry the torch from Exeter to Taunton.

However, some of the Olympic torchbearers have caused a stir after cashing in on their once-in-a-lifetime privilege by selling their torches on eBay.

Before the first day of the relay was completed, the gold torches appeared on the online auction site.A torch used during the relay on Saturday is currently attracting bids of more than £30,000.

The seller lists the item as: 'An amazing sporting souvenir, be one of the first to have one!' Other torchbearers have pledged to donate the proceeds from the sale to charity.

Sarah Milner Simonds, from Burnham-on-Sea, who is selling her torch to raise money for the project she represents, said she had received a bid of more than £150,000.

Ms Milner said she still needed to check if the bid was genuine. 'It only occurred to me to do it on Saturday night,' she told BBC Breakfast.

'The sale closed last night at 10pm and the final bid was £153,000.'

The torchbearer, who was nominated for her work as a community gardener for the People's Plot, said she was dismayed that people who objected to her decision had started sending her abusive emails.

'Obviously it has really upset people but I think that it's not something that is really me to keep my shiny trophy on a mantelpiece when it is obvious how much good one can do with the money that someone might be willing to pay for it.'

Organisers will be hoping for a repeat of the scenes on the first two days of the relay when excited people packed the streets of Cornwall and Devon to catch a glimpse of the torch.

Yesterday began at the Plymouth Life Centre with the torch in the hands of 18-year-old Jordan Anderton.

The relay travelled from Plymouth, through Totnes, Paignton and Torquay on the south Devon coast, before finishing in Exeter for an evening celebration.

More than 8,500 people filled Exeter Cathedral Gardens to watch a live show of music and dance.

Away from the official Olympic Torch Relay, residents in Hatherleigh, Devon got on with some burning of their own.

But perhaps holding a flaming fireball on a stick close to a row of pretty thatched cottages was not quite a gold medal idea.

As crowds of local residents lined the streets of the small market town clapping the unofficial torch bearers down the street, thick black smoke filled the air.

Luckily the event passed without incident. And what's more the unofficial torch, which must have cost a fraction of the £495 price of a golden cheese grater, did not malfunction, despite the wind.
