One of Britain's most important fuel pipelines has been closed today after police discovered a gang of thieves had siphoned off thousands of gallons of diesel in a 'sophisticated' heist.

It is believed more than 30,000 litres of diesel may have been taken from the pipeline running from Esso's Fawley Refinery in Hampshire.

That would be worth about £41,000 ($70,000) at pump prices.

The alarm was raised when the owner of an industrial unit in Romsey, near where the pipeline passes, discovered a large amount 
  of fuel hidden at the scene.

A gang of thieves has tapped into one of the country's main underground fuel pipelines to steal more than 30,000 litres of diesel

Detectives have arrested two men, aged 32 and 34, in connection with the thefts.

Today, police were guarding the spot in West Wellow, Hampshire, where the thieves are thought to have tapped into the 14-inch pipeline.

The fuel is being stored safely and engineers from the refinery are working to retrieve it, police confirmed.

The pipeline, known as the Midline Pipeline and owned by Esso, is one of the UK's main underground fuel supply routes for gas, diesel, gasoline and jet fuel.

It runs 130 miles from the 
  Esso refinery in Fawley near Southampton to the West Midlands and is 14in in diameter.

The pipeline cost £40 million to construct in the mid 1980s and was extended in the 1990s. It now runs out to Birmingham International Airport.

Detectives are today investigating the 'sophisticated' and 'potentially lethal' plot to siphon the fuel

It has been reported that a similar incident took place recently in Gloucestershire.

However, oil theft from pipelines is relatively 
rare in the UK but a major problem in some parts of the world, such as 
Nigeria where it is estimated to cost the government up to $1 billion 
per month.

An Esso spokesman: 'Esso is assisting Hampshire Police with their enquiries following the discovery of a store of fuel in the Romsey area.

The pipeline runs 130 miles from the Esso refinery in Fawley near Southampton to the West Midlands and is 14in in diameter

'Early indications suggest that the fuel may have come from a nearby Esso pipeline. Investigations continue into whether this is the case.

'Esso is committed to the very highest standards of safety. The pipeline has therefore been closed down and our specialists are working to check it and, if necessary, effect any repair.

'We will not resume operations of the pipeline until this work is complete.'

Detectives from Hampshire Constabulary said they are investigating the 'sophisticated' and 'potentially lethal' plot to siphon the fuel.

A force spokesman said: 'We can confirm two men, aged 32 and 34 from the Salisbury area, remain in police custody for questioning this evening.

'Both men were arrested in Salisbury last night on suspicion of conspiracy to steal fuel.

'Police launched an investigation after a large quantity of diesel was found in an industrial storage unit at West Wellow.

'Lines of inquiry include establishing the exact amount of fuel stolen and examining the suspected sophisticated method used in this alleged theft.

'The discovery was made by the unit's owner at around 7.30pm on Thursday. It is believed to have been illegally obtained.

'The exact quantity and circumstances surrounding the accumulation of fuel are central to the investigation, and detectives are focusing on identifying those responsible.

'The fuel is stored safely and securely and is being retrieved by engineers from the nearby Esso refinery.

'The investigation, led by Lyndhurst CID, is still in its early stages and this is all the information we are able to release at this time.'
