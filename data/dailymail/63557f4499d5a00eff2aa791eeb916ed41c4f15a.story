Aviation authorities are trying to calm passengers’ fears over an Icelandic volcano that is at risk of erupting.

The UK’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and air traffic control company Nats say Britain is better prepared than in 2010 to deal with a potential ash cloud crisis if the Bardarbunga volcano erupts.

The organisations have reassured travellers they will not see a repeat of the chaos when the gigantic ash cloud caused by the Eyjafjallajokull volcano grounded more than 100,000 flights and ruined millions of holidays.

No fear: Authorities say they are better prepared to deal with an ash cloud crisis after an eruption in 2010

The Icelandic Meteorological Office said the area around the Bardarbunga volcano is still being rocked by hundreds of earthquakes each day, but there are no signs of magma moving to the surface.

Two intense earthquake swarms were first detected last Saturday at Iceland’s largest volcano, which is located under the country’s largest glacier.

As a precaution, police have evacuated an area north of the volcano, about 200 miles northeast of the capital Reykjavik, and closed roads.

The country has raised its aviation alert level to orange, the second-highest level on the five-colour scale. 

Both the CAA and Nats said the UK is much better prepared to deal with any ash cloud crisis based on lessons learned four years ago, and there are now arrangements in place to minimise disruptions and maintain public safety. 

A Nats spokeswoman said: ‘We are monitoring the situation in Iceland and we don’t know how serious it will get and just where any ash cloud will travel if the volcano erupts.'

The spokeswoman said: ‘Even in a worst-case scenario we are in a much better position to deal with this than we were in 2010.’

In 2010, the eruption of Iceland’s Eyjafjallajokull volcano led to much of Europe’s airspace being shut down for six days, causing widespread cancellations and losses of more than £1.2 billion.

Since then, aviation authorities have implemented a number of improvements, including a system that gives airlines access to wider airspace in the event of an eruption, a radar in Iceland that detects ash particles in the atmosphere, and enhanced ash cloud models and forecasts that help them to identify the areas to avoid, the CAA said.

In 2010, the situation was aggravated by strong northerly winds and unusually high volumes of fine ash that posed a danger to jet engines.
