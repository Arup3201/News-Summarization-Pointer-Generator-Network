Household name: Critics say Alan Titchmarsh has been given preferential treatment because of his popularity

His fellow gardeners were all banned from presenting at Chelsea Flower Show when they found themselves at risk of ‘conflict of interest’.

But it appears when you are Alan Titchmarsh and regarded as the nation’s favourite green-fingered expert, the same guidelines don’t apply.

The BBC was yesterday accused of having one rule for Titchmarsh and another for its lesser lights after it emerged the gardener has been allowed to present Chelsea Flower Show coverage while being the face of Waitrose, a sponsor at the event.

The supermarket’s exhibit of UK produce — featuring fruit, vegetables, flowers and plants on sale in its stores — this week won a gold medal at Chelsea.

Titchmarsh, 64, has a lucrative deal to promote the chain’s gardening range.

Until recently, the 'nation’s favourite gardener' also had a multi-million-pound contract as an ambassador for B&Q, sponsor of Prince Harry’s garden at the Chelsea show.

Last year the BBC banned three presenters — Joe Swift, Chris Beardshaw and Andy Sturgeon — who had designed Chelsea gardens from covering the event because of 'conflict of interest' concerns.

But Titchmarsh, who appears prominently on Waitrose’s website hailing the show as 'magical', has not been dropped by the BBC this year.

The presenter, who remains a 'friend of B&Q', according to the garden centre chain, was free to highlight Harry’s silver medal- winning garden on BBC2 this week.

Critics claimed that the corporation has one rule for its best-known presenters and another for lesser lights.

The gardening writer and broadcaster Steve Bradley said: 'It just seems to me the bigger you are the more you get away with.

'If these people are going to work for Waitrose or B&Q, the BBC shouldn’t have them doing Chelsea Flower Show and should give  a chance to other guys who don’t get a look in.

'The bigger you become, the more they’ll bend the rules for you. Titchmarsh still does a good job but the rules are the rules and should apply to everybody.’

Last year Titchmarsh’s usual Chelsea 
co-presenter Joe Swift was dropped from the main evening programme after
 he designed a show garden for DIY chain Homebase.

And Beardshaw and Sturgeon were not allowed on screen until the winners of their category had been announced.

Diarmuid Gavin was dropped by the BBC from its 2006 Chelsea coverage after appearing in a commercial for compost company Westland.

And in 1976, Percy Thrower was axed by the BBC from his job presenting Gardener’s World for appearing in an ICI weedkiller advert.

TaxPayers’ Alliance research director
 John O’Connell said: 'It’s important the BBC does not let  presenters 
promote their commercial interests on a channel which is funded by 
licence fee payers.

'It’s 
also critical that if it has one rule for a presenter such as Alan 
Titchmarsh it should have the same rules for everyone else.'

By the book: Andy Sturgeon followed the guidelines last year and bowed out of presenting while his Cancer Research UK garden (pictured) was on show. The same rules have not been applied to Mr Titchmarsh's commercial interest

The BBC said: 'Alan has ensured that his relationship with Waitrose does not breach our guidelines and will not impact on show coverage.

'He will not be associated with the Waitrose exhibit, as is the case with other BBC presenters who have commercial relationships with Chelsea exhibitors.

'Alan can mention B&Q if it is editorially relevant. As he no longer has a contract with B&Q, there is no conflict of interest.'

Titchmarsh’s agent Annie Sweetbaum said: 'The only stand that Alan cannot mention is the one being sponsored by Waitrose.'
