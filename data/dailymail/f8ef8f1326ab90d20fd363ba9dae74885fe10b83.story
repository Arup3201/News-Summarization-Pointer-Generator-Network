The general secretary of the Football Association has insisted match-fixing is not widespread in the game but has warned against complacency.

Alex Horne was among representatives from five sports - football, cricket, tennis and the two rugby codes - who attended a summit with ministers in Whitehall this morning for talks on tackling fixing.

It followed the arrest of six people, including Blackburn striker DJ Campbell, following an investigation into spot-fixing in football by the National Crime Agency (NCA).

Mr Horne, who was at the meeting with culture, media and sport secretary Maria Miller, said the 'general consensus' was that fixing was not a widespread problem.

Representatives from the Premier League, Football League and British Horseracing Authority (BHA) were also present.

Mr Horne insisted however that the FA, which already has its own integrity unit and education programmes, took the issue seriously and will study 
measures against fixing already in place in cricket and horse racing.

Horne
said after the meeting: 'I think the general consensus around the room 
was this isn't a big issue. The intelligence that we have says this 
isn't a wide-scale issue at the moment but, again, we don't want to be 
complacent.

'It's clear 
that, as Britain, we are very proud of our sporting product, of the 
sport that we play in this country and we all want to do all we can to 
protect the integrity of that sport.

'We
are never complacent on this issue and there's a lot we can learn from 
other sports. Some of the education programmes that cricket have put in 
place are very far advanced, and the integrity unit that the BHA have in
place is very far advanced so there's lots of learnings that are open 
to all sports.'

Mr Horne said: 'We don't want to see this in our sport and so, therefore, we 
are doing everything we can, we are looking at all measures we can 
across sport but also with the agencies.

Detectives are understood to be likely to review a yellow card DJ Campbell received for this tackle in a league game last week

Campbell was booked for the tackle he committed in the first half of the league game between Blackburn Rovers and Ipswich Town last Tuesday

'We
really welcome the recent impetus from the NCA. I think that is going 
to be a really important body for all of us in reminding people that 
these are criminal activities and the criminal nature of activities 
shouldn't be underestimated and all power to the NCA.'

Culture Secretary Maria Miller told Sky News: 'I think British sport leads the way when it comes to integrity and when it comes to putting at the heart of governing bodies the importance of players who are doing the right thing.'

Some officials are understood to believe the law should be changed to make match-fixing itself a criminal offence.

At the moment police have to use fraud or other related charges against people accused of fixing games.

Ministers
are understood to be open to any suggestions and will be pushing for 
sports to share any intelligence they have on fixing with the Gambling 
Commission.

Campbell, 32, 
was one of six people detained in an investigation by the National Crime
Agency (NCA) after it acted on information passed to it by the Sun on 
Sunday newspaper.

Six people including Blackburn striker DJ Campbell (left) have been arrested and bailed during an investigation into spot-fixing in football. Sam Sodje (right, playing for Charlton Athletic) has been filmed apparently arranging to rig football matches

Six people, including Campbell, have been bailed until April, the NCA said.

Detectives
are likely to review a yellow card Campbell received for a tackle 
committed in the first half of Blackburn's league game against Ipswich 
last Tuesday.

According to 
the Sun on Sunday, an undercover investigator met former Portsmouth 
player Sam Sodje, who allegedly said he could arrange for footballers in
the Championship to get themselves a yellow card in return for tens of 
thousands of pounds.

The 
34-year-old claimed he could rig Premier League games and even said he 
was preparing to fix matches at next year's World Cup in Brazil, the 
newspaper reported.

Portsmouth
were due to hold a meeting with their players in the wake of the 
allegations but Pompey chairman Iain McIness said the betting industry's
responsibilities should also be examined.

He
said: 'I think the gaming industry should be held to account. Somebody 
can sit on their laptop and check out of a bet, you don't even have to 
win the bet now. There is just too much of it.'

It
also alleged that Oldham player Cristian Montano failed to get a yellow
card in return for money in a match against Wolves on October 22 and 
offered to take part in another rigging incident.

Another
of the suspects was reported to be Sodje's brother Akpo, 33, who plays 
for Tranmere, who said they were aware of the allegations but would make
no further comment.

The NCA
is already carrying out a separate investigation into an alleged 
international illegal betting syndicate and have charged four people, 
including two Conference South players, with fixing-related offences.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
