Illegal immigrants made hundreds of complaints last year about a private security company that runs removal centres.

G4S, which came under the spotlight last year when Angolan detainee Jimmy Mubenga died after being restrained on a flight, received 773 complaints in 2010.

The most common concerned lost property or poor communication - but others related to assault and racism.

G4S said it took all complaints 'seriously' but that the ones substantiated were 'extremely low' and of a minor nature.

The figures, disclosed under Freedom of Information rules, revealed the firm received 240 more complaints in 2010 than it did during 2009.

Of those 773, almost 640 were found to be unsubstantiated and almost 130 were logged as fully or partially substantiated.

There were 48 claims of assault, three of which were upheld. Two complaints of racism were partially substantiated, but six were dismissed.

There were 1,497 complaints between December 2008 and April 2011, with eight out of 10 relating to the quality of services, rather than allegations of staff misconduct.

During the two-and-a-half-year period some 65,000 people passed through the three centres run by the firm.

Total complaints in 2010 were up by 240 over the previous year, but the proportion which were upheld fell over the same period.

G4S runs three removal centres and until recently escorted detainees who were being deported.

More than half of all the complaints were made at Brook House, near Gatwick Airport in West Sussex, which holds convicted foreign criminals facing deportation.

G4S also runs Tinsley House, also near Gatwick Airport, and Dungavel House in South Lanarkshire.

Three men remain on bail while police investigate the death of Jimmy Mubenga, an Angolan detainee who died after being restrained by three G4S guards on a flight in 2010.

Figures recently disclosed in Parliament show the company has contracts worth Â£4.6bn with four government departments, including the Home Office and Ministry of Justice. It will soon take on the government's family accommodation unit near Gatwick.

A spokesman for G4S told the BBC: 'Anyone detained within our immigration facilities is given every opportunity to raise concerns about either the treatment they receive from our staff or the services we provide.

'The level of substantiated complaints against our employees over the last three years, at 25, is extremely low and of a minor nature, albeit we take each one very seriously.

'The vast majority of upheld complaints relate to issues at Brook House IRC, which houses some of the UK's most challenging detainees, including a number of convicted criminals, prior to their deportation.'

David Wood, head of criminality and detention at the UK Border Agency, added: 'The way complaints are processed and recorded has been made simpler in recent years, which has led to a rise in recording.

'Complaints range from issues about the food served at mealtimes to more serious issues. Importantly these figures show a decrease in substantiated complaints and that the majority of complaints are minor and relate to availability of facilities at the centres.'
