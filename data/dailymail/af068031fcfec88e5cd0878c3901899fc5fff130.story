Afternoon tea with your nan will never be the same again.

A London-based designer has created a coffee table that doubles up as a levitating magic carpet.

The impressive design is the brainchild of Barking-based artist Chris Duffy who has launched an optical illusion furniture range inspired by his childhood fairy tales.

Designer Chris Duffy has created this pixelated 'magic carpet' rug as part of its optical illusion furniture range

The designer set about inventing the magic carpet after watching Aladdin and thinking: ‘How can I get that into my home?’

The digitally-printed table, which costs £1,495, features a pixelated Persian rug design with a shadow design on its base.

'I didn't want to have to resort to using supernatural powers or industrial magnets,' Mr Duffy told MailOnline.

The illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm-wide leg at the centre of the table. A shadow base, shown in these images in black, makes the table appear as though it is floating

Another one of Mr Duffy's designs is the £2,495 Woodsman Axe Table, inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood', as the imagined furniture of the woodsman

The illusion is created by mounting the steel rug on a hidden 5cm-wide cantilever at the centre of the table.

A shadow base makes it appear as though it is floating.

It also has a wave-like surface to add to the illusion of a magic carpet moving in its stationary position.

Unless you lie down on the floor next to the table, you won’t know how it works, said Mr Duffy.

'The solution came from one of our previous designs, the shadow chair which was launched a year or two before.

'The table works in a similar way by a cantilever against the shadow base.

'This way we can keep the legs and framework very well hidden under the table top, we are able to maximise this using the latest CAD technology and 3D design programmes, to push these effects and materials to their limits.

'The illusion works from all angles both sitting and standing, the wave effect is also an optical illusion caused by the pixelated Persian rug pattern and form, the table top is actually completely flat.'

'Our designs often play with the theme of gravity, which rings true with the mind-boggling creation of the "Up" coffee table,' said the Brighton University graduate

The designer has also created a four poster table structure that uses its structure to suspend eight chairs that sway playfully

'We've had interest from offices, hotels and homes,' said Mr Duffy. 'They really love the quirky furniture.' Pictured here is a close-up of chairs swinging on a boardroom table

Another one of Mr Duffy's designs is the £2,495 Woodsman Axe Table, inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairy tale 'Little Red Riding Hood', as the imagined furniture of the woodsman.

‘Our designs often play with the theme of gravity, which rings true with the mind-boggling creation of the “Up” coffee table,’ said the Brighton University graduate.

Working with the illusion of levitation the table gives the impression the glass top is being suspended by small balloons. The limited edition version costs £5,800.

Another version of the Monolith table is pictured here. The glass table top seems to balance miraculously on top of toppling monoliths, which appear to be frozen in a permanent state of impending collapse

And it isn’t just living rooms Mr Duffy is planning to invade. The designer has also created a four poster boardroom table that uses its structure to suspend eight chairs that sway playfully.

‘We’ve had interest from offices, hotels, homes,’ said Mr Duffy. ‘They really love the quirky furniture.’

In the ‘Monolith Table’, Mr Duffy took inspiration from The Sentinel, a book by Arthur C. Clarke that went on to be made into the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, directed by Stanley Kubrick.

The glass table top seems to balance miraculously on top of toppling monoliths, which appear to be frozen in a permanent state of impending collapse.

‘It's supported by magic’, said Mr Duffy. ‘…and also some physics.’
