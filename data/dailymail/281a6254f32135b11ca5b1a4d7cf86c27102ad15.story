A same-sex couple in Ohio were left flabbergasted when a local videographer refused to film their wedding citing religious reasons.

Jenn Moffitt and her partner Jerra Kincely had sent an email to video production business Next Door Stories in Bexley, about filming their upcoming wedding.

'Unfortunately at this time I do not offer services for same-sex weddings,' replied owner Courtney Schmackers.

Jenn Moffitt and Jerra Kincely contacts Next Door Stories in Bexley, Ohio, last month but owner Courtney Schackers replied that she doesn't do same-sex weddings for religious reasons

Courtney Schmackers has refused to comment publicly on the issue but posted her version of events on Facebook and said: 'I made a business decision based on my spiritual beliefs and the biblical definition of a marriage because I thought I had a right to that'

'I couldn't believe it,' Moffitt told CNN. 'It is a small business, and I thought this was a tight knit community. We wanted to support local commerce and to get that kind of response was astounding.'

Schmackers has refused to comment publicly on the issue but posted her version of events on Facebook.

'I made a business decision based on my spiritual beliefs and the biblical definition of a marriage because I thought I had a right to that. Unfortunately I gave the wrong answer to the wrong person, who decided to make a private issue into a public platform,' she wrote. 

Angered by their treatment, the couple filed a complaint against the business with the Bexley Area Chamber of Commerce. 

In a statement, Bexley Mayor Ben Kessler said: 'Understandably, the community is concerned about a recent internet post regarding a query to a Bexley based business, in which the private business in question has reportedly denied a service based on sexual orientation.

'The City is concerned as well. We are proud of our community's welcoming environment and encourage mutual respect and inclusivity.

Jerra Kincely shared both the reply from Schmackers and the videographer's explanation for refusing to film the couple's upcoming wedding

'Bexley, Ohio is a community that embraces diversity and welcomes businesses, families and individuals of ALL sexual orientation, race, religion, age, nationality, ethnicity, disabilities, socio-economic levels, etc. As an employer and a provider of services to our residents, we extend that same openness and inclusivity.'

The city is currently one of the municipalities in Ohio that doesn't prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation. 

Moffitt hopes the attention from officials will lead to legislation that protects Ohio's LGBT community.

'The outpouring from strangers has been absolutely amazing,' she said.

Ohio is one of 13 states that currently does not allow same-sex marriage. 

The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to make a decision on whether the state's same-sex marriage ban is constitutional come spring.
