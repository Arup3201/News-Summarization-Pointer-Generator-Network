A photographer captured the hilarious moment his friend climbed up a freezing canyon completely naked.

Dressed in only an orange torch helmet and climbing boots, the brave climber - identified only as Sam - scales the sheer frozen canyon face.

The freezing temperatures have visibly taken a toll on Sam's legs as they turn a deep purple from the cold.

The nude climber was photographed by his friend Ian MacLellan in a drainage ditch near Worcester, Massachusetts.

Ian said: 'I've always wanted to do an essay on ice climbing as I don't understand how people can be that committed in such freezing temperatures.

'As Sam kept climbing you could see his legs turning purple from the cold.

'I am not sure how he kept on going for that long - even with clothes on it was chilly.

'I can't imagine what it was like in the nude.'

The frozen valley - known locally as the Auburn Ice Canyon - is in fact a massive drainage ditch  which freezes over in winter.

Ian has been shooting rock climbers for the last decade and specialises in working in cold, wet and windy conditions.
