Warren Buffett has let go of 245million Tesco shares following the supermarket chain's poor performance

Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has dealt Tesco a double blow after dumping more than 245 million of the crisis-hit grocer’s shares just days after branding his holding a ‘huge mistake’.

The investment guru, known as the Sage of Omaha, is thought to have lost as much as £500million since investing in the troubled supermarket back in 2006.

Buffett’s investment vehicle Berkshire Hathaway was the third-largest shareholder, with a 3.97 per cent stake, but it has reduced this.

Last week Berkshire reduced its holding to below 3 per cent, and now owns 245.3million shares. 

At the end of 2013 his stake was valued at around £1billion.

Buffett, who is worth an estimated £41.5billion, had already added to Tesco’s woes by admitting buying Tesco was a bad move. 

In a TV interview he had said: ‘I made a mistake on Tesco. That was a huge mistake by me.’

Shares in Tesco have slumped from 365.50p to 172p over the last 12 months as it stumbled from one disaster to another. 

Analysts have warned that at below 170p the company looks ripe for a takeover bid.

Britain’s biggest retailer has issued three profits warnings and for a period had no executive directors at all on the board after chief executive Philip Clarke was ousted and finance chief Laurie McIlwee was replaced.

An investigation has been launched into allegations that bosses inflated Tesco profits by £250million.

The supermarket told the City that profits for the six months to August 23 were about £1.1billion, however this was not correct and the real figure was some £250million lower.

Tesco launched its own inquiry involving Deloitte alongside Freshfields, the group's external legal advisers, however the Financial Conduct Authority decided the situation was so serious that it needs to investigate.

If it finds evidence of wrong-doing, penalties range from public censure through to large fines for the company and individuals.

In a worst case scenario, it is possible executives might be guilty of market abuse which could, in theory, lead to a prosecution for criminal misconduct and a jail sentence.

Eight senior executives have been suspended and the results of a probe by accountant Deloitte and law firm Freshfields will be shared at Tesco’s interim update next Thursday.

Among those suspended are the UK managing director Chris Bush who was asked to step aside three weeks ago, after the most recent profits warning.

Food commercial director John Scouler and finance director Carl Rogberg and Matt Simister, chief executive of Tesco Food Sourcing Ltd were also suspended.

Last week it was revealed a fifth executive, reported to be commercial director Kevin Grace had been suspended from duty.

And on Tuesday, it was announced three more executives were to be suspended.

They are understood to be Dan Jago, head of beer, wine and spirits, and Sean McCurley, director of convenience, together with another category director, William Linnane.

New chief executive Dave Lewis said at the time that the suspensions would allow the company to carry out a 'full and frank' investigation and was not disciplinary or an indication of guilt. 

However, the retailer beefed up its board last week by appointing Richard Cousins, chief executive of catering giant Compass, and Mikael Ohlsson, former boss of Ikea, as non-executive directors.

It is also reported commercial director Kevin Grace, left and Sean McCurley right, director of convenience are suspended 

Tesco has also insisted it would 'continue to co-operate fully with the FCA and other relevant authorities considering this matter'. 

Buffett first bought into Tesco in 2006, to the tune of £205million, and raised his stake at the start of 2012, a year after Clarke had taken over the helm. Berkshire is the second major shareholder to sell down its stake in Tesco.

Last month Tesco’s second biggest shareholder BlackRock said it had reduced its holding to below 5 per cent.

Many shareholders are waiting to hear the conclusion of the internal investigation next week before taking a decision on their holding and whether they will continue to back the chairman, Sir Richard Broadbent.

The Serious Fraud Office is watching the situation closely and the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority, has already launched its own probe.

Meanwhile last week it emerged that more than 4,000 head office and corporate staff were being sent to work one day a fortnight on the shop floor in the run-up to Christmas, in an initiative by Mr Lewis to try to reconnect those running the group with customers.

All of the ‘big four’ supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have come under fierce pressure from the budget chains such as Aldi and Lidl.

At the same time, families are buying less food and they have turned away from using big hypermarkets in favour of making smaller, more regular purchases from convenience stores.

The established chains have been dragged into a price war to try and keep customers happy, but this is decimating their profits.

February 2011

Sir Terry Leahy steps down as chief executive on his 55th birthday after 14 years in charge, overseeing a leap in pre-tax profits from £750 million in 1997 to £3.4 billion in April 2010.

His record includes the launch of Tesco.com and premium range Tesco Finest and its expansion into America with the Fresh & Easy chain. The market share of the group stands at 30.5 per cent.

January 2012

Less than a year into Philip Clarke's tenure, Tesco shocks the market with its first profit warning in almost 20 years after poor Christmas trading. Shares plunge by as much as 15 per cent, or more than £4 billion.

Former chief executive Philip Clarke left the chain earlier this year

Tesco, in common with the country's three other leading grocers - Wal-Mart's Asda, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - finds itself squeezed by discounters Aldi and Lidl and upmarket grocers Waitrose and Marks & Spencer.

April 2012

Tesco unveils a £1 billion UK revival plan, which includes upgrading stores, the recruitment of more staff and better prices and value. The initiative follows complaints that its 2,800 stores are cold and industrial with poor levels of service.

April 2013

The retailer reports its first fall in annual profits in 19 years, with post-tax profit tumbling almost 96 per cent to £120 million from a year earlier.

The figure is hit by a £1.2 billion charge on the retailer's US Fresh & Easy chain of around 200 stores as it confirms it will leave the country.

The firm also suffers a £804 million write-down in the UK on land for more than 100 major stores, bought at the height of the property boom, which will no longer be developed.

February 2014

The supermarket promises to spend an additional £200 million on lower prices for basic products, such as carrots, tomatoes, onions, peppers and cucumbers.

It will also rein in annual capital spending to no more than £2.5 billion for at least the next three years as a result of the dramatic reduction in store expansion - nearly half the £4.7 billion spent in 2008/09.

April 2014

Mr Clarke brushes off speculation about his future despite little sign that his £1 billion plan to turn around the retail juggernaut is bearing fruit.

Profits fall 6.9 per cent to £3.05 billion for the year to February 22 while fourth-quarter like-for-like sales slump by 3 per cent as its UK market share falls to 28.6 per cent in the 12 weeks to March 31, from 29.7 per cent in the same period a year earlier.

June 2014

Till-roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel show a decline in Tesco's market share to 29% in the 12 weeks to May 25, compared with 30.5 per cent a year earlier.

A day later, the chain reports a 3.7 per cent fall in like-for-like sales for the first quarter of its financial year. It is a performance that Mr Clarke admits is the worst he has seen in four decades at the supermarket chain.

At the company's annual meeting, chairman Sir Richard Broadbent asks shareholders to give management more time to complete their turnaround plans.

July 2014

Tesco announces that Mr Clarke will step down from the board on October 1 to be replaced by Unilever executive Dave Lewis.

Sales and trading profit in the first half of the year are 'somewhat below' expectations, the company adds.

August 2014

Tesco issues profit warning to tell the markets that it expects its first-half profits will be £400million less than expected. It slashes dividend payments by 75 per cent and £1billion is wiped off the company's market value. The change at the top of the supermarket is brought forward by a month in order to allow Mr Lewis to commence a review of 'every aspect' of the group's operations.

September 2014

Company launches an investigation after admitting that its previously warned of fall in takings actually over-estimated profits by as much as £250million. The error relates to timing issues on when Tesco's UK business reports the income it receives from suppliers. Supermarket then admits that it was without a finance director in the five months leading up to the accounting scandal.
