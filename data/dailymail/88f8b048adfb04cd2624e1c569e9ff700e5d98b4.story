More than one million Syrians have been forced to leave their lives behind to escape the war, crossing the borders to neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, and Iraq.

As many feared they would be stopped if they appeared to be on the run, the refugees could only carry little more than what they can fit in their pockets or the folds of their clothes.

They have brought with them what is closest to their hearts, seeking sanctuary from the Syrian conflict in refugee camps and temporary shelters.

The Quran: Iman, 25, pictured with son Ahmed and daughter Aishia in Nizip refugee camp in Turkey, holds her copy of the holy book of Islam, saying it gives her a sense of protection

Mother-of-two Iman, 25, holds tight onto  son Ahmed and daughter Aishia - and her copy of the Quran - in Nizip refugee camp in Turkey,

Iman fled Aleppo after hearing of sexual 
harassment against women in the city. She lost five relatives on the 
journey to Turkey but says as long as she has her Quran she is 
protected.

A majority of these portraits were 
taken in Domiz refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, where many Syrians have
taken shelter since the start of the civil war.

Waleed, a 37-year-old doctor, poses 
for a portrait in the camp’s Médecins Sans Frontières clinic where he 
works, carrying his most valuable possession: a photograph of his wife.

They fled Syria together only 20 days after she
gave birth. ‘This is important because she gave
me this photo back home before we were married, during the time when we
were dating. It always brings me great memories and reminds me of my 
happiest time back home in Syria.’

‘I left the country for the sake of my family. I don't want 
to see my children grow up as orphans.’

Buzuq: Omar, 37, holds a long-necked lute, known as a buzuq, which he brought with him to Domiz from Damascus as his family fled following his neighbours' murder

Bracelets: May, aged eight, is showing off her bracelets in Domiz camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, saying that although they are her most treasured in the camp, her favourite thing is her doll Nancy which she had to leave behind

House keys: Although he does not know if the family home still exist, Abdul hopes to return to the flat in Damascus from Lebanon's Bekaa Valley where his family, his wife, daughter and her three children, now live in a plywood shelter

Eight-year-old May is showing off her 
bracelets, but says she misses her doll Nancy which was left behind in Damascus.  Since arriving in Domiz from Damascus, she 
has had recurring nightmares. Her family made their way by foot and bus to the border, where they followed a rough trail in the cold to Domiz.

Salma, who is at least 90, fled from Qamishly City, Syria with her three sons. She wears an old ring that was given to her by her dying mother when she was just ten years old. She 
says her mother told her to keep the ring to remember her and she intends 
to wear the ring to her grave.

‘It's not valuable - not silver or gold 
- just an old ring. But it's all that I have left.’

Omar, 37, fled his home in the Syrian capital of Damascus the night that his neighbors were killed.

‘The killers came into their home, 
whoever they were, and savagely cut my neighbour and his two sons,’ he 
recalls.

He holds a buzuq, a type of long-necked lute, saying that when he plays it, 'it fills me with a sense of nostalgia and reminds me of my homeland.

'For a short time, it gives me some relief from my sorrows.'

Her mother's ring: Salma, who is 'at least 90' and fled to Domiz with her three sons and their families from Qamishly City, Syria, wears the ring her dying mother gave her when she was ten years old

Jeans and phone: Leila, aged nine, holds a her favuirite pair of wedding jeans, while, Yusuf, right,holds his mobile phone in the building he now calls home in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, which he uses to call his father,  who is still in Syria, and to look at pictures of family members left behind

My soul: Alia, 24, does not consider her wheelchair a possession which she has taken with her, but an extension of her body, saying she has brought only her soul from Daraa, Syria to Domiz

His wife's image: Waleed, a 37-year-old doctor pictured at his place of work at the Médecins Sans Frontières clinic in the Domiz refugee camp in Iraqi Kurdistan, carrying his most valuable possession: a photo of his wife

Confined to a wheelchair and blind 
in both eyes, 24-year-old Alia says she was terrified by what was 
happening around her in Daara, Syria before her family fled.

‘Men in uniforms came and killed our cow.
They fought outside our house and there were many dead soldiers. I 
cried and cried.'

Alia says the only important thing that she 
brought with her ‘is 'my soul, nothing more'. When 
asked about her wheelchair, she seems surprised, saying she considers it
an extension of her body, not an object.

Student Tamara, 20, is pictured in 
Adiyaman refugee camp in Turkey, holding her education diploma. After 
Tamara's home in Idlib was partially destroyed in September, the family 
decided their best chance of safety was to reach the Syrian-Turkish 
border.

‘When we left our house, we felt the 
sky was raining bullets,’ Tamara recalled. ‘We were moving from one 
shelter to another in order to protect ourselves.’

Covering his face, a man named Abdul holds the 
keys to his home. Although he doesn't know if the apartment still stands, he dreams every day of returning.

‘God willing, I 
will see you this time next year in Damascus,’ he told UNHCR in 
Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.

He and his family fled their apartment
in the Syrian capital shortly after his wife was wounded in the 
crossfire between armed groups. Abdul, his wife, their daughter, and her
children share a plywood shelter constructed by UNHCR and the Danish 
Refugee Council.

Diploma: Tamara, 20, pictured in Adiyaman refugee camp in Turkey, holding her education diploma - the most important thing she brought from her partially destroyed home in Idlib

What got me through: Ahmed, 70, left, holds the cane which helped him cross the Iraqi border and into the Domiz camp, while Mohamed, a 43-year-old refugee from Syria's Hassakeh governorate, who is the imam at the camp mosque, holds his copy of the Quran

My wife: Ayman, 82, (left) with wife Yasmine, 67, whom he says is the most important thing he was able to bring from Aleppo, which they fled after their son's murder

‘She's the best woman that I've met 
in my life,’ says 82-year-old Ayman about his wife Yasmine, 67 - the 
most important thing he brought with him.

‘Even if I were to go back 55 
years, I would choose you again,’ he adds, turning to his wife. The 
couple, pictured in Nizip refugee camp in Turkey, fled from their rural home near Aleppo after their 
neighbor and his son were brutally killed.

Breaking into tears, Ayman describes 
how nearby farms came under attack, and how homes were looted and set on
fire. ‘It is unbelievable that any human being can do this to another,’
he said.

Leila, aged nine, holds up a pair of 
jeans in Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, where she and her family found 
shelter in a partially constructed home which they now share with 30 
others. The family fled from Deir Alzur in Syria after their neighbours 
were killed by a shell.

‘I went shopping with my parents one 
day and looked for hours without finding anything I liked. But when I 
saw these, I knew instantly that these were perfect because they have a 
flower on them, and I love flowers,’ she explains.

Leila has only worn 
the jeans three times, all in Syria - twice to wedding parties and once
when she went to visit her grandfather. She says she won't wear them 
again until she attends another wedding, and she hopes it, too, will be 
in Syria.
