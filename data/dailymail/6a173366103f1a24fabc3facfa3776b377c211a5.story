The family of a 61-year-old father of four shot dead by cops at his New Mexico home on Wednesday are denying police claims that they were called to a domestic dispute and arrived to find the man 'suicidal' and brandishing a deadly weapon.

John Rogers, a truck driver from Bloomfield, is survived by his wife Billie, their four children and 18 grandchildren.

According to the police report, Bloomfield officers were responding to a domestic dispute at the Rogers home and when they confronted Rogers, who was armed.

The family deny calling the police, although John Rogers' brother Abe told the Daily Times said that a family member had called a friend during a 'squabble' at the house on Wednesday morning. 

He said he believes that friend called the Bloomfield Police Department. The family denies that Rogers was armed when he was approached by officers. 

She describes seeing two police cruisers stop outside the house while she was inside doing some cleaning. Her husband was in the garage working on his motorcycle, she said.

Before she could do anything, the officers shot and killed her husband.

'I seen a cop walking up towards him with his gun out, and I screamed,' she told KOB. 'I ran out the back door and… "boom boom."

'Why? Why did they kill my husband?' 

The two 'boom' sounds were both officers firing their weapons, claims Rogers son Jonathan. 

He said that New Mexico State Police detectives told him two shots had been fired, one by an officer using his sidearm, the other fired from a shotgun. 

'They said there was a struggle, and the officer pulled out his gun and shot him in the head,' said Jonathan Rogers. 'While he was still gurgling, they put their cold, steel boots to his neck.'

Bloomfield Police Chief Randy Foster confirmed on Thursday that two Bloomfield police officers have been placed on paid administrative leave, pending the outcome of the investigation. 

'Why did they kill my husband?' Wife Billie screamed as she saw two officers shot her husband dead

Foster has brought in New Mexico State Police to provide a thorough, unbiased investigation 'that people can be confident in.'

According to the New Mexico State Police investigation that officers were responding to a call about a suicidal man.

The family said they feel John Rodgers wasn't given a chance to surrender, and they don't believe he was a danger to himself or anyone else. 

'We are being left in the dark; they aren't telling us anything,' said John Rogers' daughter Becky Medina.
