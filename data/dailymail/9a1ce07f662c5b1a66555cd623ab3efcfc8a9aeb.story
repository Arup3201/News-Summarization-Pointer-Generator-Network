A group of children got to dress up in their finest Halloween costumes as they were sworn in as United States citizens during a naturalization ceremony in Baltimore.

The group of 49 children donned their best outfits - including a bright blue Captain America suit and a yellow banana outfit - at an immigration event in Maryland.

And it will be a day that they're not likely to forget as they proudly pledged allegiance to their new country in an array of brightly colored outfits.

The children, who came from 21 different countries from all over the world were encouraged to attend the ceremony in their Halloween costumes by United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) officials.

One young man stole the show by turning up in a bright yellow banana-themed Halloween costume which left only his face showing out of a round hole.

Kritagya Ghimire proudly stepped forward to receive his Certificate of Citizenship in the Banana costume at the Halloween themed naturalization ceremony which took place on October 31.  

Meanwhile, 3-year-old Erza Retta Dessie from Ethiopia wore a Captain America costume as he was sworn in at the event.

Another girl smiled broadly in her eye-catching Sponge Bob SquarePants costume as she put her right hand over her heart to recite the pledge of allegiance.

During the last decade, America has welcomed more than 6.6 million naturalized citizens into the country, according to the USCIS.
