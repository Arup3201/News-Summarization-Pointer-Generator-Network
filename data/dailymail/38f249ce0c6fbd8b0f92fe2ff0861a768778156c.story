The former producer and ex-boyfriend of Lady Gaga must pay a Hollywood songwriter who discovered the pop star $7.3million after he promised to split profits with her, a federal judge ruled.

Producer Rob Fusari’s argument to reduce the amount the jury awarded to songwriter Wendy Starland last year was ruled against by U.S. District court judge Jose Linares on Wednesday.

Starland testified during the trial that Fusari, based in Parsippany, New Jersey, had asked her to find an ‘edgy, bold, confident, charismatic’ performer and ‘someone that you can't take your eyes off of’.

 Lady Gaga said in a deposition in 2011 that she believed Starland, who wrote songs with her, and Fusari had a verbal agreement to split their share from her career

She added that Fusari asked her to go out and find him a 'unique female singer, under the age of 25, who could be the female equivalent of the lead singer of the band The Strokes.'

The songwriter brought back Lady Gaga after spotting her during a New York City performance at The Cutting Room in 2006, when the pop star went by her given name, Stefani Germanotta.

Lady Gaga said in a deposition in 2011 that she believed Starland, who wrote songs with her, and Fusari had a verbal agreement to split their share from her career.

‘My understanding was that Wendy and him had initially agreed upon 50/50 perhaps before Wendy ever found me, and after I was signed to Rob and made music, Rob began to change his mind,’ said Lady Gaga, whose hits have included Poker Face and Bad Romance.

Fusari, a Grammy Award-winning producer whose credits include work for Beyonce, Whitney Houston and Will Smith, previously sued Lady Gaga for $35million in court in New York, but that lawsuit was dropped.
