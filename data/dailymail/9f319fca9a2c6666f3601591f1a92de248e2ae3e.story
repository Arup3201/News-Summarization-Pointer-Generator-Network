Germany midfielder Toni Kroos is no closer to committing his own future to Bayern Munich despite the new deals given to Thomas Muller and Philipp Lahm.

Muller extended his contract until 2019 with Lahm committing until 2018 last week, but Kroos, who has been linked with a move to Manchester United, where former Bayern coach Louis van Gaal takes charge next month, is still far from agreeing new terms.

Kroos has already turned down Bayern's first offer and suggested more acceptable terms, but the record German champions have yet to reach a compromise with the 24-year-old.

'There's nothing new to report,' Kroos said at a press conference on Wednesday. 'With respect to the time before the World Cup, nothing at all has changed.

'If anything does happen, then you will all find out. Congratulations to Philipp and Thomas for their decisions and extensions.'

Kroos is still tied to Bayern until 2015, but should no new agreement be reached there may be a temptation to sell the former Bayer Leverkusen midfielder this summer rather than potentially lose him on a free transfer next year.

In the meantime, Kroos is focusing on helping Germany win their first World Cup since West Germany's 1990 triumph, saying euphoria is unlikely to distract them after the 4-0 win over Portugal on Monday.

They face Ghana next, in Fortaleza on Saturday.

'We don't need bringing back down to earth because we've only won one game and that's nothing compared to what we have planned,' Kroos said.

'Our opening game is already history; it doesn't count anymore It's great that we've made people euphoric, but that euphoria certainly isn't going to get to us.'
