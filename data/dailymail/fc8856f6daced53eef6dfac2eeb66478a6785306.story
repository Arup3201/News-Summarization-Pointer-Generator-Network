A German mineral water company is under fire for promoting a product using Michael Schumacher despite concerns he may not make a full recovery following his skiing accident.

The advert was produced for a March edition of a football referee association in Frankfurt and was printed in January as the seven times Formula One world champion Schumacher, 45, fought for his life in an artificially-induced coma. 

The advert even has Schumacher, who 
faces the possibility of being in a permanent vegetative state for the 
rest of his life, saying that water gives the consumer '2-1 for your 
body.'

Schumacher has endorsed the brand for many years.

The company, Hassia, which bottles the water said: 'We reacted immediately after the accident, cancelled radio and TV commercials as well as all print and outdoor ads.

'We could not however replace at short notice the pre-press advertisements.'

Schumacher will today spend his 65th day
 in the coma in which he was placed on December 29 last year following a 
low-speed ski-accident at the French Alpine resort of Meribel.

Accident: Schumacher had a brain haemorrhage after falling and hitting his head on a rock while skiing off-piste in the French resort of Meribel on Sunday

He hit his head on a rock and suffered such severe brain injuries he was not expected to last the night when he was flown in an emergency helicopter to Grenoble's University Hospital.

Three weeks ago doctors began slowly 
easing back on the anesthetic keeping him under in a bid to bring him 
round and, hopefully, see signs of life. 

Doctors operated to remove blood clots from his brain, but some were left because they were too deeply embedded.

Patients who have had major head injuries are sometimes put in a drug-induced coma to give the brain a chance to heal; a coma reduces the need for blood flow and may help the swelling go down.Aziz said doctors typically try every few days to bring someone out of a coma.

So far he has not given doctors any signals that he is responding.

His medical team are praying he opens his eyes or displays some other recognition of his environment.

Schumacher, whose wife Corinna and teenage children Gina Marie, 16, and son Mick, 14, are constantly at his bedside, faces many months, even years, of intensive therapy to regain speech and limb co-ordination if he does wake up.

Doctors in the UK, Switzerland and Germany recently voiced fears that the prolonged time that he has been in the coma suggests his brain injuries are far worse than his family and medical team have let on about.

Corinna spent her 45th birthday sitting at the bedside of her stricken husband with her children, her brother-in-law and her father-in-law yesterday.
