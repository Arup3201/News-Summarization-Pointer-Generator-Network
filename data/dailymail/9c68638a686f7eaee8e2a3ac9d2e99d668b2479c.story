Weighing 107 kilograms and chowing down on a greasy breakfast, Allirra Braun watched as her grandmother begged for more time to live from her deathbed.

At 29-years-old, the Indigenous mother-of-two from Katherine in the Northern Territory, remembers this moment as the day her whole life changed.

'I was with her at the hospital when the doctor told her she was passing away,' Mrs Braun told Daily Mail Australia of her grandmother Sadie Ludwig.

'She had always managed her diabetes, but the doctor was saying "this is the last of your life, your body won't be able to recover, your organs are shutting down".

Allirra Braun, 29, (pictured finishing Sydney's City2Surf) transformed her life one and a half years ago after losing 32 kilograms

The mother-of-two was inspired by her grandmother Sadie Ludwig, who died of diabetes in January 2013

'She begged and bargained with him for her life. She definitely wasn't ready to go and wanted more time in life and it just made me feel so guilty.

'I was throwing my life away and she was begging for hers and I felt extremely embarrassed and shameful. 

Ten months after her grandmother passed away in January of 2013, the 29-year-old shed more than 30 kilograms from her frame as she forced herself to run from power-pole to power-pole in her tiny town. 

'To start off with, I couldn't run one hundred metres – on that same path now, I'm doing 20kms regularly,' Mrs Braun said.

'Back then, I thought that the posts were 200 metre apart so I thought, "ah yeh, I'll go half way". Turns out there's only 100 metres between the posts.' 

Mr Braun, who weighed 107kg at the time, listened to Ms Ludwig beg for more time on her deathbed

Since her grandmother passed away, Mrs Braun has transformed her life 

As running became easier, Mrs Braun would walk the 2.6 km to work each day, 'cleaned up' her eating and soon found herself working as a casual group fitness trainer alongside her full time job as a Mission Australia youth worker.

She also signed herself up for the Indigenous Marathon Project, set up to 'promote healthy lifestyles to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples' and beat almost 120 people for a spot on the 12 person squad.

Since running with the group, Mrs Braun says she has realised that running is her 'niche', as she continues to be the first in her team to finish each event, including: a 10km Canberra run, Sydney's City to Surf, a 21km half marathon at the Gold Coast and a 30km event in Alice Springs. 

'It feels so good, I've never felt so alive or been this skinny in my entire life. It's important for someone like me to show people that no matter wherever you came from or how big feel, you can train your body to do amazing things,' Mrs Braun said.

Unable to run for more than 50 metre at a time, she began by training her self to run between the power-poles in her tiny home town of Katherine in the Northern Territory (left). She now runs up to 20km at a time

'I've got a three-year-old (Lucian) and a 10-year-old (Francis), and that's why I wanted to do it because, being Indigenous, I don't think of myself as an individual – I am my family and then my roots, Gurrindji and Kungurrakan.

'I'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick, I'm changing my families lives as well.

'A lot of Indigenous women in Katherine ask me how I lost weight and when I first started running, I was the only Indigenous woman running in town - now they're all walking and pounding the pavement. 

'We [Indigenous people] are predisposed for some of the worst chronic illnesses out there and we are so community oriented, we need strong mums – they are the fabric of families and teach the kids – if we go back – we could turn around whole lives.

The next stop for Mrs Braun (far left) is the Big Apple where she'll run the New York City Marathon's 42.195km for the first time on Sunday alongside her Indigenous Marathon Project team-mates (pictured) 

Awarded by Katherine Multi Sports for being the first to finish the Gold Coast half marathon, Mrs Braun said she believes she's found her 'niche' in running 

Mrs Braun said that it was her family, three-year-old Lucian, 10-year-old Francis and her husband Justin who push her to keep going. 'Being Indigenous, I don't think of myself as an individual – I am my family ...I'm not just stopping myself from being the diabetic hat trick, I'm changing my families lives as well,' she said

The next stop for Mrs Braun, whose hometown of Katherine only has one set of traffic lights, is the Big Apple where she'll run the New York City Marathon's 42.195km for the first time on Sunday.

'The New York City Marathon will be my first official marathon. I'm confident. I'm a long distance runner for sure, I'm not a sprinter. I have the same pace for 10, 20 and 30 km races so I'll stick to my pace until the end.

'The last 12km will be all mental determination, but I'll keep running for my family and my people – I'll be the first Gurrindji and Kungurrakan to run any marathon.'

But when life settles back to normal again, Mrs Braun can't wait to get back to the dusty Katherine track, in the early hours of the morning before her family has woken up for the day.

'Three jobs and two kids, I just love it because it gives me that time for myself,' Mrs Braun laughs.
