This is the first World Cup David Beckham hasn’t been directly involved in for more than 20 years, yet the crowning glory of a lifetime’s work will be felt in the Amazon on Sunday night when the whole of America stops to see how Team USA perform against Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal.

Make no mistake, America is going ‘soccer-crazy’. Not in an underground kind of way, but mainstream crazy, with millions following every kick and Hollywood celebrities tweeting about the hottest show in town.

There will be tens of thousands of USA fans in Manaus — 90,000 World Cup tickets were sold in America for this tournament, more than in any other country bar hosts Brazil — and more than 20million viewers are expected to  tune in. To put it into context, only 18m saw San Antonio Spurs become basketball’s NBA champions last week.

It’s an extraordinary coming of age for football in the States, helped by the insatiable patriotism that America taps into whenever one of their teams or personalities do well, as they did in beating Ghana 2-1 in their opening match.

But none of it would have been possible without our greatest English export. Beckham has galvanised interest since he shocked the world by leaving Real Madrid for Los Angeles Galaxy in 2007.

Four years ago, Beckham was in the England dug-out alongside Fabio Capello, having played in the three previous World Cups.

For Paul Dalglish, son of Liverpool and Scotland legend Kenny and someone who has been in America for eight years as a player, coach and manager, Beckham has created a monster in terms of public interest.

‘I wouldn’t say soccer has grown at grassroots level too much because it was already the most popular participant sport ahead of baseball and basketball, even when I arrived in 2006 to play for Houston,’ he said.

‘The big game-changer in terms of its growth as a professional sport was when Beckham arrived in 2007.

‘He is more than a soccer player, he is an icon; a franchise in himself. The MLS league here had only 12 teams when he arrived — next year there will be 21. He was a catalyst in making the sport mainstream and getting people to spend more money to watch soccer.’

The myth of the USA being inward-looking, whose sports teams call themselves world champions without leaving North America, has been shattered.

Basketball superstar LeBron James gave his 13m Twitter followers a blow-by- blow commentary of the USA’s first game, posting immediately after Clint Dempsey’s 30-second opening goal against Ghana: ‘Now, that’s how you start a game!’

Justin Timberlake is an avowed fan and even the White House shared the joy after John Brooks headed USA’s winning goal against Ghana. ‘Congrats! Great start at the World Cup,’ they tweeted.Interest in Sunday’s game has not been topped, even when America hosted the World Cup in 1994.

The first four pages of the New York Times were dedicated to soccer last week and Jurgen Klinsmann’s decision to leave out the country’s most famous player, Landon Donovan, caused almost as much hysteria as Glenn Hoddle did when he jettisoned Paul Gascoigne in 1998.

‘The backlash was intense but what it did was put a lot more attention on the national team,’ said Dalglish.

‘The one name everyone is familiar with, even by those who don’t follow the game closely, is Donovan. He’s the greatest footballer the States has ever produced.’

Fortunately for the Germans, beating Ghana has lifted the pressure, although expectations are now sky-high for the Portugal game. USA probably need a result to qualify, with Germany lying in wait for their final group game.

Despite knee problems, Ronaldo is capable of beating any team but midfielder Kyle Beckerman, who plays for MLS side Real Salt Lake where Dalglish is assistant-coach, says USA are ready.

‘We’ve watched Portugal closely, even their warm-up games against Ireland and Mexico,’ he said.

‘There are guys like Tim Howard and Clint Dempsey who realise that while we were ecstatic to beat Ghana, we have to come down from the cloud and get ourselves ready, because one win isn’t enough.

‘Everyone knows about Cristiano and we know he’ll be motivated after the first game (Germany won 4-0).’

As for the support, he added: ‘It is special. There was just a buzz around the stadium against Ghana. It’s caught us off guard that so many Americans are here. It was really emotional during the national anthem.’

Dalglish has only to take a straw poll of one to realise soccer is really taking off.

‘My wife is American but she doesn’t take too much interest in soccer generally or the MLS, even though it’s my job. But she won’t be missing Sunday’s World Cup game for anything.’

Ronaldo will be centre-stage but the excitement would not have been created without Beckham.

‘Ronaldo and Messi are well known in America as footballers but nowhere like the same level of fame as Beckham. He was on billboards, he was on Ellen (a chat-show for A-list celebrities),’ said Dalglish.

‘When he arrived, he literally sold out stadiums because people wanted to see him play.

‘He may be retired but you can see at this World Cup, the impact he had lives on.’
