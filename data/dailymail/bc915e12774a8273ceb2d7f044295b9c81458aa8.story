Former Arsenal defender Sol Campbell has taken to Twitter to describe how he was racially abused while visiting Hexham market square in Northumberland.

The 39-year-old claims that a passer-by, who did not know who he was, said 'I like your tan' as he walked while out shopping with his family.

Campbell, who won 73 caps for England, tweeted: 'Can't escape racial abuse. Just had a lovely lunch with the family at @Lord_Crewe_Arms, then went into Hexham for a bit of shopping.

'In the market square a man passed me & said 'I like your tan'. He didn't think I'd react. I did. I told him to stop racially abusing people.

'He openly admitted he had & didn't care. He offered a fight. His wife asked me to stop drawing attention to them. He didn't know who I was.

'If he had, would he have done it? How often does this happen to people not in the public eye who don't fight back or question it?

'It doesn't matter about wealth or where you're from. No one should have to put up with this kind of abuse.

'And this was in the centre of Hexham market square. It was not a figment of my imagination.'

The ex-Tottenham and Portsmouth star has previously spoken about how black players are scared to admit they have been racially abused. 

He has also questioned whether elements of the FA are racist and claims he would've captained his country for more than a decade if he'd been white.

In an authorised biography released earlier this year, Campbell said: 'I believe if I was white I would’ve been England captain for more than 10 years. It’s as simple as that.'
