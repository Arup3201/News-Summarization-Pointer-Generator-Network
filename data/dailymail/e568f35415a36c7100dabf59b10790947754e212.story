Ander Herrera's rib injury that is set to keep the Manchester United midfielder out of action for at least a month could have been made worse by a collision with referee Lee Mason.

Herrera picked up the problem in Saturday's 2-1 win over West Ham and a clip of the incident shows him colliding with the official and clutching his ribs almost immediately.

The Spaniard later limped out of the match with just 16 minutes left.

A United statement confirmed: 'Ander sustained a fractured rib during the match against West Ham. (He) was substituted in the 74th minute and the club will continue to monitor his progress over the next few weeks.'

Herrera himself tweeted: 'A real shame this injury, but now's not the time to feel sorry for myself. I'm already working to be back as soon as possible!'

A fractured rib usually takes up to four weeks to heal, though the recovery period can be as long as six weeks.

Spanish midfielder Herrera has scored twice for United this season but will sit out the next few games

United face Everton at the weekend and with a break for internationals to follow, United will be keeping their fingers crossed he just misses matches against West Brom and Chelsea after sitting out the visit of the Toffees.

Manager Louis van Gaal already has a host of absentees with Wayne Rooney suspended and injuries to Jonny Evans, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Michael Carrick, Marouane Fellaini, Ashley Young and Jesse Lingard. 

Herrera has already had a short spell on the sidelines after injuring his ankle in training

Carrick and Jones are close to returning but the injury to Herrera is the second he has suffered this season.

The 25-year-old, a summer signing from Athletic Bilbao, missed the Premier League clashes with Burnley and Sunderland after hurting his ankle in training.
