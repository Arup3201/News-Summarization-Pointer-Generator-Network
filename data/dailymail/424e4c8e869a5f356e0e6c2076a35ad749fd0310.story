Louis van Gaal has been criticised by the Dutch fitness coach who branded David Moyes a ‘dinosaur’ after Robin Van Persie suffered a tight groin during Holland’s friendly with Wales.

Raymond Verheijen, who has worked at clubs across Europe, said Van Gaal’s programme of two training sessions per day had increased the chance of muscle injuries.

Van Persie came off at half-time of the 2-0 win in the Amsterdam Arena and is being checked by the team doctor with Holland’s first World Cup game against Spain just a week away. The squad flew to Brazil on Thursday.

Tired? Robin van Persie suffered a tight groin during Holland's friendly against Wales

Verheijen, who slammed Moyes after accusing him of overtraining Van Persie last pre-season, wrote on Twitter on Thursday: ‘Holland looked tired & slow last night vs Wales. As expected, muscle injuries start to accumulate after weeks of intensive & double sessions.

‘Fit but tired players who have to train intensively twice a day will accumulate even more fatigue. Injury risk will increase dramatically.

‘Why are these NT (national team) coaches pushing their players so hard after a long season?’
