An out-of-control blaze came agonisingly close to homes today as fire ripped through Whiteman Park in Perth's north-east.

Homes, lives and a nearby wildlife park were all under threat from the massive blaze, which threatened to burn into a new housing estate in the suburb. 

An emergency warning was issued for people in the parts of Brabham and Henley Brook bounded by Lord Street, Henley Street, Murray Street and Woollcott Street, in the City of Swan.

'You are in danger and need to act immediately to survive,' the Department of Fire and Emergency Services said.
