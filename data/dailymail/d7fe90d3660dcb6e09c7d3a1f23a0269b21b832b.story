A new 'evolving' bike that grows with its owner has been designed to save parents hundreds of pounds.

The Evolve 3-in-1 bike starts as a trike for toddlers and can then be configured to become a balance bike that becomes taller and bigger as the child grows.

The Evolve is due to sell for £97 ($150).

A new 'evolving' bike that grows with a child has been designed to save parents hundreds of pounds. The Evolve 3-in-1 bike starts as a trike for toddlers and can then be configured to become a balance bike that becomes taller and bigger as the child grows. The Evolve is due to sell for £97 ($150)

Height: 53cm

Length: 78cm

Width: 48cm

Seat Height: 32cm up to 37cm 

The Evolve bike was created by New Jersey-based design company YBIKE. 

According to figures from Halfords, an 
average child's bike costs around £250 and each child will outgrow four 
trikes and bikes in their lifetime.

The Evolve is due to go on sale for £97 - providing a potential saving of more than £900.

It begins as a trike with three wheels. 

As the child gets older and more confident, the rear wheels can be slid closer together to turn the trike into a bike with a larger rear wheel to help with balance.

Once the child is ready, one of the rear wheels can be removed using a traditional screwdriver to create a balance bike for older children.

The adjustable seat grows with children aged between two and five and the seat height can be made taller, up to 37cm.

It has passed the child safety regulations for Europe and the U.S and its creators have now launched a Kickstarter campaign to launch the product.

Jaco Kruger, managing director of YBIKE said: 'No parent wants to restrict their child’s development but as parents, our team knows how expensive and time-consuming it is to keep buying a new bike every time your child grows out of the old one.

'This is the fun and unique bike that grows up with your child. It’s like a transformers trike-bike for children.

'The Evolve means that children learn how to balance instinctively at the same time as having fun.'
