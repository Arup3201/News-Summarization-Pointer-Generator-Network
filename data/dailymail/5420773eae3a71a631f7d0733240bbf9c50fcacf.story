Zlatan Ibrahimovic has spoken of his regret at not playing under former manager Jose Mourinho longer.  

The flamboyant striker spent just one year under the Portuguese coach while the pair were both at Inter Milan, before moving to Barcelona as part of a £35 million plus player deal with Samuel Eto'o. 

Still, what a year it was. As Inter claimed the 2008-09 Serie A title, Ibrahimovic finished as the league's top scorer with 25 goals and was also crowed 'Foreign Player of the Year.'

Now, playing for Ligue 1 side PSG, via Barcelona and a return to the San Siro with AC Milan, Ibrahimovic has hailed the time he spent under Mourinho as a particular career highlight. 

'We worked together for one year at Inter The feeling was great between us and my only regret is that we were together for only one year,' Ibrahimovic told Telefoot. 

Mourinho, meanwhile, is now in charge of Chelsea, PSG's opponents in the Champions League's last 16.  

The two sides drew 1-1 in the round's first leg at the Parc des Princes and will play the return fixture at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday. 

Ibrahimovic has been in superb form for his club this season, scoring 18 goals in 27 appearances.
