With its collapsed ceilings and rotting doors, these haunting images show the crumbling remains of an abandoned hospital.

The Renwick Ruin on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island in New York was also known as the Smallpox Hospital.

It was constructed between 1854 and 1856 and for many years it was New York City's only such institution.

The haunting and crumbling Renwick Ruin on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island in New York was also known as the Smallpox Hospital

The hospital was constructed between 1854 and 1856 and remained open for a century before being abandoned and falling into ruin

Since 1950s New York City has been slowing gutting the property and now just the crumbling exterior stone walls remain

A century after the hospital opened its doors were closed, and the hospital was eventually designated a New York City Landmark in 1976.

Now the site is closed off and an ongoing $4.5 million renovation project is underway before the ruins open to the public.

Keen photographer Gordon Donovan traveled to the island to capture these stunning images.

He said: 'When the tide goes out on the Queens side of the island you can climb rocks and access the ruins.

When the 100-bed hospital opened New York City still had frequent outbreaks of smallpox, despite the arrival of a vaccine

'Since 1950s New York City has been slowing gutting the property and building.

'Everything in these photos has slowly been cleaned out leaving the stone exterior walls.

'There are no higher floors - since they all collapsed.

'The scary parts are where sections of the roof are hanging - it's a very weird feeling.'

A series of engineers, architects, masons and ironworkers have been working to restore the building and open it to the public

The photographer said the scary parts of the abandoned hospital are where sections of the roof are hanging down from above
