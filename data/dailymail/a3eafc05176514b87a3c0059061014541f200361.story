Whoever beats Brazil wins the World Cup this summer. It’s that simple for me, for reasons I’ll explain in a moment, and Argentina and Portugal — with one massive caveat — are the two biggest challengers to the hosts.

The caveat is whether Cristiano Ronaldo, the world’s best footballer, is fully fit and playing at his peak. 

If he is, and it’s a big if, then I think the Portuguese are capable of being the cat among the pigeons.Can you imagine a final that pits  Ronaldo on one side against the world’s second-best player, Lionel Messi, on the other? It would be a fantasy showdown. I for one would absolutely love to see that happen.

Influence: Cristiano Ronaldo could lead Portugal to World Cup glory in Brazil this summer

Crucial: With Ronaldo in their team, Portugal could go all the way to the final in Rio De Janeiro

Tough: Portugal have been drawn in group G alongside Germany, Ghana and the USA

If you think Cristiano has an  enormous ego already, imagine what it would be like if he reached the World Cup final! As a big fan of his, as well as his friend, I relish the prospect of that spectacle. He’s a showman and this is the biggest show.

People see his ego — and don’t get me wrong, Cristiano’s ego is gargantuan! — but that is his fuel. It’s his inspiration. He reads all the articles written comparing him with Messi. ‘How can they say Messi is better than me?’ he’ll ask. ‘I’ll prove that writer wrong.’ That’s his mindset. Driven. Self-obsessed in the most positive way. Always looking to improve. That’s why he has become what he is, through effort and determination. 

It didn’t all come naturally. He worked hard at technique and hitting the ball. He’s the hardest worker I’ve had the privilege to play alongside. 

He’s a great team-mate, a companionable man, always involved in the changing room. But when it’s time to work he’s passionate about what he does and his emotion comes out.

Heavyweights: Lionel Messi's Argentina team have been tipped to win the World Cup

Predictions: Rio Ferdinand is tipping Brazil to be victorious in the World Cup on home soil

People say he stole Gareth Bale’s thunder in the Champions League final. Eh? He took his shirt off. He’s got an unbelievable physique and his girlfriend is a supermodel, and someone’s criticising him for taking his shirt off? 

The exhibitionist is part of who he is. But away from the field of play he’s one of the nicest kids you could meet. He makes time for fans, he’ll sit around a table late into the night talking. He’s no lone wolf.

He first came to our attention at Manchester United when we played Sporting Lisbon in 2003. By half-time he’d razzle-dazzled us and we were all in the dressing room asking: ‘Who the hell is this kid? We MUST sign him!’ And Sir Alex did. He arrived at Old Trafford with his tricks and his stepovers and his attitude. What a young showpony he was, wanting to look good, then be good, in that order. The wrong order.

Fergie had a word or three over time, and so did Ronnie’s hugely influential compatriot, Carlos Queiroz, and we as team-mates let him know there needed to be an end product to his skills.

Change:  Ronaldo left Sporting Lisbon in 2003 to join Manchester United, where he became a star

To his enormous credit, the penny dropped, and he took it all on board and started on his journey to become the world’s best. There are players who maybe have more natural talent and the penny never drops for them. You will have guessed by now that I’m a fan of CR7’s work! I hope for him that he has a standout World Cup. With him on fire, Portugal can make huge waves. Without him, they’re half a team or less.

With my pragmatist’s hat on, and fearing that seven games could be a few too far for Portugal if Ronaldo isn’t 100 per cent physically well, I believe we’ll see a Brazil-Argentina final. 

And I think that Brazil, inspired by the maverick genius of Neymar, will be triumphant on home soil.I see Brazil overcoming Germany (if not Portugal) in one semi-final, and Argentina beating Spain in the other.

I think Holland might struggle to get out of Group B, that Spain should win, because Chile are a fine team, although Robin van Persie is a match-winner. Colombia and Ivory Coast should come through Group C and England’s group are dealt with elsewhere: Italy plus one, basically. France win Group E for me, and Argentina take F, with Germany and  Portugal coming out of G and probably Belgium winning H.

Pressure: Neymar is the poster boy of the World Cup and is expected to fire Brazil to glory

Tricky: 2010 finalists Spain and Netherlands have been drawn in the same group this time

Shining light: With Messi leading the line, Argentina have an number of attacking options

The Belgians should win their group, but they are a peculiar prospect in some ways. They could be the team everyone believes they are capable of being and reach the last eight or further. Or they could be the biggest burster of expectations because their youth and inexperience may tell at this level. 

Argentina have a strength in depth that means they could cope without Messi if they had to. It tells you something when a player of Carlos Tevez’s qualities didn’t even make the cut.

Aside from Messi, they have Gonzalo Higuain, Sergio Aguero — the world’s best natural goalscorer in my book — as well as Angel Di Maria, one of the stars of the Champions League last season, and Ezequiel Lavezzi, and on and on. The one area of caution is defence, but it’s hardly shabby.

As big an admirer of Spain as I have been in recent times, I do think this could be a tournament too far as age starts to tell. But they’ll still go far. But not as far as Brazil. The Confederations Cup victory last summer was a fillip that cannot be understated. They know now they can perform and win under that enormous home pressure.

Dark horse: Chelsea playmaker Eden Hazard will lead Belgium's quest at the World Cup

In Neymar they have a player who bucks a common trend of great performances for club and indifferent games for country. He pulls on his Brazil shirt and shines. He is Brazil’s go-to guy for inspiration, and backing him up he has a cast awash with talent and no small amount of toughness, exemplified by Fernandinho, who is a top player.

Ramires is a great athlete, so too Willian. Oscar will score and Hulk is a danger. Brazil’s Achilles heel for me is a lack of a traditional No 9 but they have enough elsewhere to compensate.

As they say in Rio: Vamos!
