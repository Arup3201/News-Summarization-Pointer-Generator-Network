Billy Connolly had a theory. There were too many nuclear weapons in the world, he said, and not enough people being smacked in the mouth.

Boxing, by its very nature, resolves that. A lot of people get smacked in the mouth in boxing. Yet it is not just the explosive small-scale violence that chimes with Connolly’s world view.

What he was getting at, one presumes, is that many of the great conflicts and calamities of our age could have been solved by low level direct action a lot earlier. If a right-thinking person had put Benito Mussolini on his backside in 1919, do the fascists march on Rome in 1922?

Simple: Forget the great conflicts and rivalries, one punch was all it took on Saturday night for Carl Froch

Champion: The Cobra defended his IBF and WBA world super-middleweight titles after beating George Groves

A good right-hander, as thrown by Carl Froch at Wembley on Saturday night, realigns even the most fervent uprising. And that reassessment was unavoidable once it landed.

Suddenly, George Groves sat beside his conqueror for ringside interviews, a reduced, subdued, some would say broken figure.

Words were redundant now. All the truth that was needed came in that right-hander. It told its own story: who was the champion, the better fighter, the winner and better man.

Froch left Groves lying on the Wembley canvas like a character from the cartoon Family Guy.

He fell as Peter Griffin falls: leg trapped beneath his body, arms splayed awkwardly. The difference being that Griffin is animated with limitless possibilities for the effects of misadventure, while Groves’ physical disorder was appallingly real.

It was the doubled leg that offered the clue. Nobody in  command of his senses stays like that. Referee Charlie Fitch knew Groves was gone and called the contest off, immediately. And ended all speculation.

Floored: The way Groves was knocked out at Wembley was similar to Peter Griffin from Family Guy (below)

Please: Groves pleaded with the referee to let the fight continue but it was far too late... he'd blown it

Connolly, tongue-in-cheek,  imagined a swift, sudden end to confrontation, and Froch delivered it. Around the ring, supporters of both men were shouting the odds, debating the points, calling the shots. Some had Groves ahead, like one of the judges, but a good right-hander renders all previous notation or nuance irrelevant.

Who won the sixth? Suddenly, it did not matter.

Connolly thought a good punch might prevent the nuclear option, but there was something of the red button about the way Froch finished this fight, too.

He modestly stated that he was not a knockout puncher — and not in a sly way of putting Groves down, either, although it no doubt provoked an inner wince from those with affection for the Londoner — but one cannot imagine many in the super-middleweight division, and a fair few heavier, that would have remained upright after that.

It was a thing of beauty. Each replay met with louder and louder gasps and groans from those watching Wembley’s big screens.

It put one in mind of Lennox Lewis’s knockout of Hasim Rahman in 2001, another brutal right that ended a rematch, and a conversation.

That's gotta hurt: Froch's punch was a thing of beauty, similar to Lennox Lewis' on Hasim Rahman in 2001

Before the fight, opinion was divided about whether Lewis had the heart, the will, the ability to regain his crown. Lewis hushed that talk in four, Rahman struggling to get up like a zoo animal hit with a tranquiliser dart.

Froch said he had delivered blows as devastating, but not as momentous. ‘The history of the fight, the way people will look back on it in years to come, that was the punch that finished it off,’ he said. ‘In that way, it was probably the best punch I’ve landed in my life. It closed the show, and that’s what world-class fighters do.

‘My legacy was definitely at stake. My career was over if I lost tonight. I would have retired. This was the biggest post-War fight in Britain and I didn’t want to be remembered as the loser of it. So this was one of the most satisfying nights of my life. I’ve had the weight of the world on my shoulders, I’ve had George Groves in my ear for a year.

‘He was on at me before the Mikkel Kessler fight in May 2013. I haven’t heard the end of it. I knew within 48 hours of the first fight that this rematch had to happen.’

No other athletes are confronted with legacy talk like boxers.

Tough: The pair had to conduct post-match interviews after, with Froch admitting his legacy was at stake

Legacy: Sir Alex Ferguson was an exception of those who would have to face the questions Froch does

Typically, only men like Sir Alex Ferguson, three decades at the Old Trafford coal face, field  questions about their standing in the pantheon. The day Tiger Woods retires, or Usain Bolt, it will be considered, too. Yet all boxers are required to assess.

Froch is an outstanding fighter, among the best of his generation, yet he still dreams of a major fight in Las Vegas.

There are two boxers out there, Andre Ward and Gennady Golovkin of Kazakhstan, who would stand a good chance of defeating him. Ward, an American, has already done it. Perhaps that is why Froch is respected Stateside, but not revered. Nevertheless, the legacy questions came.

Maybe, on a night when more than 80,000 filled Wembley — and more seats could have been sold were the public prepared to have their view entirely compromised — it simply felt like a consequential occasion. Froch may yet fight Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Vegas, but he is 36 now. His place in British  boxing history is assured and he is mindful of timing his farewell. Nobody wants to leave a loser.

One more? Froch may face Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr (or others), his place in British boxing history is already assured

The future is uncertain for Groves, but in a darker way. He was damned with faint praise by Froch, who spoke of him as a future champion, but only if he learned to operate within his limitations. He needs to target a weaker belt-holder, seemed to be the message.

‘It’s about levels,’ Froch said. ‘He’s not quite got the toughness that you need at the top. I’ve got ingredients that you can’t teach. If I fight George Groves 10 times I’ll beat him 10 times. He’s got to prove to me he can take more than one punch like that. He’s missing the final ingredient, the ability to stand up against the top guys. I’m not a one-punch man. I’m not Mike Tyson. I’m a concussion puncher, but I flattened him tonight.’

Another moment of reflection, and he made the baying, brawling, boiling vat of humanity that spilled over on British boxing’s biggest night, suddenly seem a distant hum.

‘When did I do it?’ Froch mused. ‘Round eight? That’s another four-and-a-half rounds, 13 minutes or so. That’s a long time to be in front of me with them little gloves on.’

A lonely place, the ring. Maybe that’s why mankind worked so hard to invent those big bombs. The hand-to-hand stuff was just too horrible.
