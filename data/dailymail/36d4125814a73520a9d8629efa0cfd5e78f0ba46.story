Sven-Goran Eriksson wants to take his former England World Cup player to China to play for his current team Guangzhou R & F.

Eriksson has recommended 35-year-old Lampard to his bosses following the midfielder’s release by Chelsea and thinks he would be a huge hit in China - although matching the player’s £150,000-a-week Premier League wages will be difficult.

The Swede, who partnered Lampard and Steve Gerrard at the 2006 World Cup in Germany, has room for one overseas signing at Guangzhou who currently sit third in the Chinese League and on course to qualify for the Asian Champions League.

Reunion? Frank Lampard is wanted by Sven Goran Erikson at Chinese club Guangzhou 

‘I have suggested to the club they take Frank Lampard,’  confirmed Eriksson. ‘He would be great in China, he is a football man, very proud and clever so if he thinks he can go on for another year or two, he will not go just for a holiday.

‘How many midfielders in the world have scored more goals than Lampard. He is still running, still scoring.

‘He is incredible and I am sure he’d be great around the camp. I have spoken to agents about it but the money is through the roof so I am not sure it can happen.’

Lampard has said he will delay a decision on his future until after the World Cup, where he is England’s vice-captain.

He
 has several offers on the table most notably from new MLS side New York
 City, who are run by Manchester City’s owners  and recently signed 
Spanish World Cup winner David Villa. 

Eriksson
 went to China a year ago and is being talked about as a candidate for 
the national team who hope to qualify for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
