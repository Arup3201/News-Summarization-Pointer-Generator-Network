Three men who brutally gang-raped and drugged a British holidaymaker at knife-point on the Costa del Sol have finally been jailed 12 years after their violent attack.

Local men Francisco Santiago, his brother Mariano and cousin David Santiago were all handed four year sentences at a Spanish court for the 2001 sexual assault, which left their female victim battered and bruised.

The
men were arrested nine years after the attack in a DNA breakthrough 
when one of the accused had his genetic profile checked following his 
arrest for an unrelated offence.

Attack: The victim was holidaying in Benalmadena on the Costa Del Sol when she was drugged and raped

They were aged between 22 and 24 at the time of the offence, and the two brothers both had previous convictions for violent crimes.

The victim, who was on holiday with her boyfriend, was alone when she met the men at a nightclub in Puerto Marina, Benalmadena.

She
was lured into accepting a lift home by the trio, but instead was taken 
'against her will' to a remote waste ground in the early hours of 
October 4, the court heard.

One
of the men told his victim that 'they were going to have some fun' as 
he brandished a knife before forcing her to take a drug.

The court heard how this put her in a 'drowsy state and she was unable to defend herself'.

The 32-year-old woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was repeatedly raped by one of her attackers.

State
prosecutor Maria Teresa Verdugo had requested sentences of 31 years for
two of the men and 26 years or the third to reflect the level of 
violence involved in the attack.

But the Malaga court took into account the time that had elapsed since the offences were committed.

The judge said there had been an 'unreasonable delay' in the men facing justice.

Justice: The rapists were convicted thanks to DNA detection through another crime

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
