Cheryl Cole may have taken her spot on the X Factor judging panel but Nicole Schzeringer isn't letting the Geordie steal her limelight.

The former Pussycat Doll has been unveiled as the glamorous face of Muller Corner De Luxe desserts range - and looks dazzling in the new campaign.

For the shoot Nicole, 35, looks irresistible in a glittering evening gown and though it might have been work, Scherzy says she loved it.

'The advert was so fun to shoot, I got to wear some amazing gowns,' she told MailOnline.

Nicole shared her diet secrets with us and you may be surprised to hear that she's partial to the odd cheese plait.

She said: 
'I travel a lot but I do love to cook when I'm at home. I love making 
pasta, because it's easy. I make a mean cheese plait, great chicken 
fajitas and teriyaki chicken with vegetables.'

Opening up
 about healthy eating habits and diets, Nicole said: 'Everyone has 
different body and blood types so it's best to just eat what makes you 
feel good.

'I believe that you should have everything in moderation. If I
 deprive myself, I want it ten folds and I'll go the opposite way.'

We know you don't get a killer bod like Nicole's without working out and she says she does lots of exercise and never eats late at night. 
'Running works so well for me,' she said. 'I get my best ideas when I 
run, it's great for me. It strengthens my mind and puts me in the best 
state of mind.

Behind the scenes: Nicole looks super glamorous in a glitzy gold and silver gown as she reveals that if she doesn't work out regularly, her body starts to crave endorphins

Work it, girl! Nicole said she loved shooting the new campaign because she got to wear lots of glamorous dresses

'I get my 
ideas for what I want to do on stage and my music when I run. I prefer 
doing it in the morning, first thing. Even if I just manage to squeeze 
in twenty minutes.

'I do Soul
 Cycle classes in LA and bikram yoga and then interval training 3-4 times per
 week. My body starts to crave the endorphins if I don't work out.'

Sharing her tips for getting a bikini body ahead of the summer, Nicole said squats, coconut water and running are essential.

To achieve her glowy skin, Nicole swears by just 'lots of water, moisturiser, illuminator and a shimmery highlighter.'

Aside from
 her work with Muller, Nicole has been designing a second collection for
 Missguided after her first range turned out to be a stellar success.

'I'm over 
the moon with how it turned out,' she said. 'It all worked out so well 
and was well received. I will be adding a summer collection with lots of
 boho inspired flowing pieces and long, colourful maxi dresses.'

Nicole has also been busy filming her new music video for her latest single Your Love, filmed in Malibu.

The
 35-year-old star is seen skipping and dancing on the beach in a pair of
 sexy daisy duke shorts before she playfully runs into the sea.

Speaking
 about re-launching her music career, she said: 'It's so great and very 
exciting. I've really come into my own sound, it doesn't sounds like 
anything that's on the market.'
