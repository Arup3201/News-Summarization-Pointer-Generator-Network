A teacher got pregnant by a teenage student and then kicked him out of her home, an investigation has revealed.

Felicia Barahona, 32, embarked on a four-month affair with the teenage boy who attended DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx where she taught two years ago. She quickly fell pregnant and gave birth to a baby girl last August.

Barahona fell pregnant after allegedly telling the boy, who has not been identified, 'not to worry' about using condoms because she didn't like them, according to an investigative report released this week.

The science teacher, a former Afghan war veteran, had waited until the boy was of legal age of consent before the pair began a sexual relationship in 2011.

Their romance allegedly began on the boy's 18th birthday, according to opposingviews.com. Barahona also allegedly bought the pair wedding rings during their short relationship.

It is believed that the couple were getting together five times a week, according to the investigation for which they were both interviewed.

According to the Daily News, the teacher threw her young lover out of her home for drinking after four months together and shortly after she fell pregnant.Â 

Barahona was fired from her $73,000-a-year job last August about the time that she gave birth to a baby girl.

On her Facebook page, Barahona says she studied at Lehman College in the City University of New York and is divorced.

DeWitt Clinton High School describes itself as 'a highly unique small learning community' on its school website.
