An unremarkable porcelain dish valued at £70 has sold for £84,000 after it was found to be from the court of King Louis XV.

It is believed the 13.5-inch French plate was displayed in a cabinet by its elderly owner who knew nothing of its royal history and thought it was of little worth.

Even the auctioneers initially failed to spot the 260-year-old plate's heritage, saying it would fetch just £70.

But closer inspection revealed it was from a collection of around 1,700 items made for the king and held at the Palace of Versailles.

A bidding frenzy saw the price rocket to 1,200 times the estimate as the plate, which dates back to 1753, was snapped up by a French antiques dealer.

The plate was part of a set made by master goldsmith Jean-Claude Duplessis between 1753 and 1755 at the Royal factory in Vincennes.

Louis XV, who ruled France from 1715 until his death in 1774, paid 87,272 French livres for the set - around £6,500 in today's money.

Jane Brown, from Wellers Auctions in Guildford, Surrey, said: 'Very little is known about the plate's history before it came to us.

'It was inherited from a deceased elderly relative who we think just kept it in her china cabinet thinking it was a pretty plate but not realising its true value.

'We missed it at the cataloguing stage and so it initially had an estimate of £70.

'After that, it went into a store room until we were ready to put it on display closer to the auction date.

'However by the time it went on view, we had a second look and realised what the plate really was.

'We got some second opinions from experts and they confirmed it was from the Louis XV service. It was just one of those auction miracles.

'There was a lot of demand for the plate and bidding was going up in increments of £5,000.

'A similar plate sold recently for £50,000 so there were smiles all round when ours sold for even more.'

Although the hammer price for the blue and white plate was £70,000, with all the fees added on, the overall price paid for it was £84,000.

Louis XV ascended the throne in 1715 at the tender age of five following the death of his great grandfather Louis XIV.

His cousin Philippe II, the Duke of Orleans, ruled as Regent until Louis was 13 and considered mature enough to take over.

Louis XV was ruler of France until he died from smallpox aged 64 in 1774.
