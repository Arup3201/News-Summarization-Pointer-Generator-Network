Monolith: An artist's impression of the new 73-story skyscraper that could be built in London's Docklands. If the plan is green-lit, it will be Britain's tallest residential tower

A 73-storey skyscraper is set to become the tallest residential tower in Britain.

A British architectural firm have submitted plans for a slim £400 million, 250 metre skyscraper in London's Docklands that will break the record for the nation's tallest block of flats.

Foster and Partners have submitted plans to the local authority, Tower Hamlets Council, for the towering building to add to the capital's soaring skyline.

If built it will take the record from St George Wharf Tower, also known as the Vauxhall Tower or The Tower, a 181 metre, 50-storey residential skyscraper in Vauxhall.

The proposed apartment block will involve the demolition of office blocks on the South Quay Plaza on the Isle of Dogs to create 947 new homes.

The development also includes a 36-storey tower fronting onto Marsh Wall to accompany the South Dock building.

The proposals also outline approximately 20,000 sq. ft. of new retail, dining and entertainment space and will also include a public open space with a riverside walkway.

Harry Lewis, Managing Director of Berkeley Homes, which is working with the architects, said: 'South Quay Plaza has a vital role to play in revitalising this dockside location - we have been working closely with the Borough and the Greater London Authority and, with their support, aim to create over 900 homes and more than 1.5 acres of landscaped open space.

'Opportunities to deliver such significant public realm in Canary Wharf are few and far between.'

The planning application was submitted in early April and Berkeley will be working with London Borough of Tower Hamlets to secure planning permission later in the year. Construction is likely to start in January 2015.

Compared to many other world-class cities, London had very few tall buildings until the development of Canary Wharf in 1988 and, later, the Gherkin and the Shard.

As well as the 73-storey building, the plans include retail and entertainment space and a walkway

If it is approved by council planners, work on the scheme could start early next year

In March an architectural think-tank claimed 236 buildings of more than 20 storeys could be on the way, four fifths of them intended as high-rise blocks of flats.

They are set to drastically reshape the London skyline, with 33 of them between 40 and 49 floors, and 22 with 50 or more.

The building boom is concentrated in London's centre and the east, which together account for 77 per cent of the new skyscrapers.

Tower Hamlets, Lambeth, Greenwich, Newham and Southwark will between them have 140 of the 236 towers.

Ever skyward: The capital is experiencing a boom in skyscrapers. The Shard (left), London's tallest building and the 37-storey 20 Fenchurch Street (right), better known as the 'Walkie-Talkie',  is currently under construction

Foreign investors from east Asia, who 
are buying into London property in unprecedented numbers, are also 
having an effect as they are comfortable with tall buildings which have 
long been part of the urban landscape in that region.

The
 Mayor's office is trying to strike a balance between protection of the 
city's historic skyline and the need to house a million more people and 
create half-a-million new jobs, said sir Edward Lister, deputy mayor for
 planning.

'Tall buildings 
will not be appropriate in many locations,' Shaun Andrews, head of 
Investor and Developer planning from GL Hearn told MailOnline.

'However,
 we cannot freeze the skyline and suspend the capital in stasis. The 
strength of London is in its diversity and its ability to respond and 
adapt to opportunities originating from both home and abroad.'
