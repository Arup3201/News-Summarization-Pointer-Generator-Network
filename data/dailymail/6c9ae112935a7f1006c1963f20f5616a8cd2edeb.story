A fifth of students are unemployed six months after graduating from some British universities, figures show.

Amid stiff competition for graduate jobs, they fail to get work despite studying for three years and building up debts.

The chances of landing a job vary considerably between institutions. Fourteen universities have unemployment rates above 15 per cent.

Prospects: Where graduates study has a big impact on their chances of finding a job

Some students are around ten times more likely to be left unemployed than those graduating from other mainstream degree courses.

At London South Bank University, 22.6
 per cent of students were not working or embarking on further study six
 months after graduating last summer, figures from the Higher Education 
Statistics Agency show.

The unemployment rate stood at 20.6 
per cent at the University of East London and 18.9 per cent at the 
University of Bolton. The national average was 9.2 per cent.

The agency’s figures will be 
particularly alarming for undergraduates who started degree courses last
 September when tuition fees were tripled to up to £9,000 a year. Some 
could leave with debts of around £30,000.

The best performing mainstream university was Robert Gordon in Aberdeen where only 2.3 per cent of students were out of work.

Among the prestigious Russell Group 
of universities – considered to be some of the best in the country – all
 but one had an unemployment rate below 10 per cent.

Top of the class: Every student to leave the Royal Academy of Music, London found work, the survey found

It was 12.5 per cent at Queen Mary, University of London.

Graduates from some of the 
institutions with the lowest unemployment rates are so successful 
because they have been on niche courses that aim to give them the 
training to shoehorn them into their vocations.

All 25 graduates from the Royal 
Academy of Music in Central London were employed or studying after 
finishing their course last year, along with 98.9 per cent at the 
Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in South-East London.

The figures also showed that students
 from Northampton and Derby universities were more likely to be in work 
than Oxbridge graduates.

Only 92 per cent of graduates who were at Oxford had a job six months after finishing their studies

Northampton had an unemployment rate of 4.3 per cent, while Derby’s was 3.9 per cent. 
Oxford’s was 8 per cent and Cambridge’s 5.1 per cent.

The majority of the 163 UK 
institutions surveyed by the statistics agency saw between 90 and 95 per
 cent of students in work or study six months after graduating, while at
 18 universities more than 95 per cent of students were in this 
category.

Other data released by the agency 
last week found that the number of graduates taking menial jobs such as 
shelf stackers, rubbish collectors and cleaners has almost doubled over 
the past six years.

Six months after graduating last 
year, 9,695 – 6 per cent of those finding employment – had taken up 
posts that did not require degrees.
