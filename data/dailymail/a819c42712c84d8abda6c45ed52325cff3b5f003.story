The wild boar population in Britain is expected to increase dramatically in coming years as a wildlife expert has called for the animal to be given the same protection as other game species. 

Earlier this week Raymond Green was killed on the M4 after hitting a wild boar and the animal was also blamed for killing one of the Princess Royal's Glocestershite Old Spot sows at a farm in the Cotswolds.

Although the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates there is around 1,000 boar living wild in Britain, some experts claim that the true figure is at least ten times that.

A wildlife expert is calling for the wild boar to be given the same protection as other game species despite the animals population rising dramatically in recent years

Charlie Jacoby believes that wild boar are colonising much of the country, as it has done in Sweden

Field sports author Charlie Jacoby has called for the animal to be regarded as part of our native wildlife and given the same protection as other game species. 

At present there are no restrictions on shooting wild boar during the breeding season.  

It's feared that indiscriminate shooting could lead to them being wiped out in Britain again, as they were in the 13th Century.  

Mr Jacoby believes that the animal is colonising much of the country, as it has done in Sweden.  A record-breaking wild boar weighing an estimated 518lb was shot in Herefordshire in 2008.They are also regularly found in Kent and East Sussex and the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire.

He told The Times: 'Numbers would remain stable for a few years then every four or five years they could shoot up. It was largely the combination of climate and food supplies that were crucial, and we are seeing the same thing happening here in the boom years.

'Now most Sweedish hunters have rifles as well as shotguns and boar have replaced pheasant as the main game species.'

Wild boar can run up to 30mph and weigh around 20 stone when fully grown. They can also jump 6ft.

The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimates there is around 1,000 boar living wild in Britain, some experts claim believe that the true figure is at least ten times that; the spread of commercial crops such as maize is said to be behind the population increase 

Wild boar are know to damage crops and 'plough up' gardens and meadows, while rooting for food, which makes them unpopular with landowners. Hunting the animal is popular in Germany were landowners are compensated for allowing the animals to remain on their land.  

Mr Jacoby told the newspaper he does not believe that boar-hunting will catch on in England where the animal has become largely nocturnal. However, in Scotland hunters pay big money to hunt wild boar at shooting estates.

Simon Gaskell, who owns the Real Boar Company that breeds the animal for salami, said: 'Wild boar do travel and they are prepared to travel quite a distance. It's only a matter of time before they start causing trouble.' 

In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby

Rangers say the Forest of Dean wild boar population is doubling every year thanks to the spread of commercial crops such as maize.

In 2013 people living in and around the Forest of Dean said they were increasingly uneasy about the number of wild boar nearby.

Wild boar dug up land where the ashes of loved ones were scattered at the Pan Tod Beacon beauty spot on Ruardean Hill outside Cinderford. The animals also destroyed grass verges in the area and in 2013 the Forestry Commission announced a cull on the population.

In 2008 one had to be shot at Ruardean Primary School and two years later the animals destroyed a football pitch.

Wild boar were hunted to extinction in Britain several centuries ago.

But their population has started to rise again after several programmes to reintroduce them in the last 15 years.

There are now thriving herds spreading out into the countryside.

Boar are usually secretive and nocturnal and are likely to stay out of the way of humans.

When fully grown a wild boar weighs around 20 stone and can jump 6ft.

They can also travel large distances and reach speeds of 30mph.

In medieval times, boar from the Royal Forest were supplied for the Royal table - there is a record of an order for 100 boars and sows for a Christmas feast in 1254.

Boar are known to inhabit parts of the Cotswolds and the Forest of Dean.

The animals have roamed wild in the Forest of Dean in 2004, after a 700 year absence.

They started to populate the wild in 1999 after several escaped from a farm and in 2004 a group of 60 were dumped - further boosting wild populations.

Since then the population has grown steadily - with complaints about them digging up graveyards, gardens and grass verges.

Farming of wild boar in Britain became fashionable in the 1970s and boar originating from the European mainland were kept under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976.
