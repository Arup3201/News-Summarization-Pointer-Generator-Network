The fractured relationship between FA chairman Greg Dyke and the Premier League over the England commission will not be improved at the summer meeting of top-flight clubs.

Dyke would normally be expected to attend at least some of the Premier League summit on June 5 and 6 at Rudding Park Hotel in Harrogate in his official capacity.

But instead he is flying to the Football League equivalent on the Algarve, where he will discuss his plans for a fifth tier in a special session with representatives from the 72 clubs meeting in Vilamoura.

In demand: FA chairman Greg Dyke will not be attending a Premier League summit in the summer, choosing instead to speak to Football League clubs about his plans for a fifth tier

Dyke’s failure to consult the Premier League about his proposals en masse at one of their summits — he prefers to talk to top-flight teams individually — has upset the League’s top brass even though they chose not to have a representative on the FA panel, having withdrawn their chairman Anthony Fry, his first choice.

Dyke named Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Stoke and Tottenham as clubs who fully support his controversial B team proposals.

Chelsea, who have more than enough players out on loan to field C and D teams as well, are another club in favour.

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, who faces a revolt over participation if the FA have their way on B teams, has another big issue to confront.

A number of teams in the top fight, who  comfortably sell out every home game, want the League to allow their many other fans to watch the Saturday 3pm kick-offs live on club outlets. But Scudamore is said to be against live coverage in that time slot so as not to dilute TV rights holders’ contracts......................................................................

It will interest everyone searching for sports sponsorship that Facebook have indicated they want to break into the sports market. And certainly the FA Cup in association with Facebook has a ring about it, especially with the extra interaction it would bring to the competition......................................................................

Greg Dyke’s commission presentation received a damning reception from a sceptical media at Wembley.

But at the same time England manager Roy Hodgson’s World Cup backroom support team were enjoying a far more successful bonding session at St George’s Park.

Particularly inspiring was said to be the speech given by sports psychologist Steve Peters.

Liverpool players demoralised by giving up a three-goal lead — and probably their title hopes — at Crystal Palace last Monday could have been excused for wanting to do anything but turn up for a club awards dinner the following night.

But every member of the squad attended the function, demonstrating a resilient team spirit under Brendan Rodgers.

The Sport Industry Awards hit a new low by allowing rabid self-publicist bookmakers Paddy Power to run a market on brand of the year when the legion of judges had chosen Wimbledon tennis as the winner months ago.

But it has to be said that the stunning sports review of the year video produced with Evoke Films — a rebranded commercial film arm of IMG — took such productions to a new level, with relevant Twitter comments made at the time cleverly linked to the action.

The 25th anniversary fund-raising dinner of the anti-racism organisation Kick It Out at Wembley on May 20 has been very poorly supported not only by clubs, with only 12 buying tables, but also by the game’s sponsors, hardly any of whom are going to be there despite almost the full complement having been asked by the organisers.

The turbulence at Leeds now includes a trio of popular club ambassadors — Peter Lorimer, Eddie Gray and Dominic Matteo — all in danger of losing their positions in new owner Massimo Cellino’s major cost-cutting operation.

Lawyers are still working on the details of David Moyes’ reported £7m pay-off from Manchester United, though no late hitches are expected.
