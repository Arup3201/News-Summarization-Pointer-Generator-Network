The biggest fight in boxing history has sold out within a minute of going on sale with tickets for Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas on May 2 being snapped up on Thursday evening.

Just minutes after 8pm UK time (12 noon in Las Vegas), tickets for the richest bout in history began appearing on the secondary market with one ticket going for a cool $128,705 (£85,508) on StubHub.

After weeks of wrangling and accusations between Mayweather Promotions and Pacquiao’s promoter Bob Arum, a batch of between 500 and 1,000 tickets were made available to boxing fans for the mega-fight in May.  

Late last night, a ticket priced at $128,705 (£85,508) appeared on the StubHub website after all tickets on public sale were snapped up inside a minute

Less than a minute after 8pm, the Ticketmaster website announces that no tickets are available  

Fight fans were able to purchase the tickets through mgmgrand.com and ticketmaster.com - although those precious seats certainly came at a cost as prices began at $1,500 (£1,000) leading all the way up to $7,500 (£5,000) per seat. Prospective buyers were limited to four tickets per person. The mgmgrand.com website experienced issues minutes before the 8pm start time due to high traffic.

Those lucky enough to secure a seat for the mega-fight via Ticketmaster will have to collect them in person from Wednesday, April 29 from a designated collection point in Las Vegas.

Super-ringside tickets costing $10,000 (£6,600) were not released for public sale with several reports suggesting those seats would exchange hands on the 'black market' for upwards of $200,000 (£133,000).

The capacity of MGM Grand is 16,800 seats with the remaining seats set to be divided up between the two promoters, the two cable networks sharing the pay-per-view broadcast and the MGM hotel group for their clients and high rollers.

MGM also announced the sale of around 50,000 tickets for closed circuit seats at its various properties at £100 ($150) per head. Priced at $150 (£100), these tickets also went on sale on Thursday.

Media interest in the eagerly-anticipated bout has been staggering with almost 15,000 accreditation requests submitted from news outlets across the globe. 

Tickets for the weigh-in go on sale on Friday at 3pm from the MGM Resorts Box Office at a cost of $10 (£6.50) per head with a limit of 10 per person. Proceeds from the ticket sales will go to charity.
