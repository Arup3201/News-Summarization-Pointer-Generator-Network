All nine of the teenagers reported missing from a rural ranch for troubled youth are back with their parents, according to the compound's attorney, however police remain reluctant to remove an Amber Alert until the location and well-being of the teens can be confirmed following allegations of abuse.

On Saturday New Mexico police confirmed that four of the nine presumed missing were in the custody of their parents but said they were still searching for the other five.

A search warrant was executed on Friday as part of the investigation of abuse at the Tierra Blanca High Country Youth Program, located at a 30,000-acre compound in high desert country, about seven miles from Hillsboro.

However officials said that the teens, aged from 13 to 17, weren't at the property in Sierra County, nor was program operator Scott Chandler, who was named a person of interest in the case.

Pete Domenici, the 
attorney for the ranch, told CNN early Sunday that the teens 
were all with their parents and have been for 'many, many hours'.

'The five remaining kids 
on the state police Amber Alert have all been with their parents for 
over 24 hours. One boy who is still listed as part of the active Amber 
Alert, has been with his parents since Wednesday.'

The news comes after the Albuquerque Journal reported last week that state authorities were investigating claims that teenage boys were beaten and forced to wear leg shackles and handcuffs for minor violations of rules at the unlicensed program.

Domenici said in a statement Friday that the boys had been 'on a previously scheduled activity away from the ranch for several days' and that nothing was wrong.

'They are safe and have already been picked up by their parents, or their parents are en route to pick them up,' he said.

Domenici accused the state of escalating the situation by failing to agree to an emergency hearing in a lawsuit the ranch filed this week over what the suit contends was an improperly handled investigation.

However, authorities issued an Amber Alert for the teenagers minutes after Domenici's statement was released, saying they need to 'visually' see the boys.

'We have allegations of abuse,' New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez told KRQE.

'We're required by law to investigate, and when you 
suddenly show up to the place and everybody's gone, it's of huge concern
to us.'

Jim Moffat, whose step-son was killed at the ranch in a rollover accident off the property last month, said at the weekend he had no reason to doubt the safety of the boys.

He said he sent his son - 18-year-old Bruce Staeger - to the ranch after he could no longer deal with him misbehaving at home, running away and getting into trouble with police.

'We didn't know what was going on,' he said. 'But we saw some great results. He turned into an awesome young man.'

Program operators had been ordered to send the kids back to their parents or surrender them to the state after staff members were accused of beating and shackling students.

The operators of the ranch, Scott and Collette Chandler, deny any children have been harmed and filed a lawsuit this week accusing investigators of targeting the ranch for closure following a fatal car crash involving students.

The operators also said investigators have been illegally interviewing students and telling parents to pull their children from the program by Friday or face abuse charges. Their lawsuit said at least one family was contacted directly by Gov. Susana Martinez, a claim her office denies.

At a news conference earlier this week, Chandler said Tierra Blanca has been operating for nearly 20 years. Its website promises a program for unmanageable kids that offers a balance of love, discipline and structure.
