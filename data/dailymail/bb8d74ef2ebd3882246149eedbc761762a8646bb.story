This is the terrifying Russian rollercoaster that was supposedly designed to make even the most daring of thrillseekers vomit on themselves.

The state-of-the-art ride - located at a theme park set deep into woodland - spins, flips and rocks passengers in all directions for the ultimate stomach-churning effect.

The rollercoaster is thought to be Vekoma's Waikiki Wave Super Flip, a model that has been around in some form for around 20 years.

Unique: The Vekoma Waikiki Wave Super Flip is different to most 'top spin' rides as it has the ability to spin in all directions

Vekoma was founded in 1926 by Hendrik op het Veld under the name 'Veld Koning Machinefabriek' and at first manufactured agricultural machinery and mining equipment.

During the company's signature ride, visitors are strapped in with harnesses to what at first looks like a typical 'top spin' rollercoaster, the Geekologie video shows.

It has one crucial difference, however. The arms can bend in all directions, allowing for diagonal twists and turns rather than only horizontal.

It allows one side of the nail-biting ride to travel in a clockwise direction, while the other moves in an anti-clockwise direction.

Screaming passengers are swung back and forth, hung upside down and tossed around in a sickeningly random fashion.

Free-wheeling: The dizzying ride in Russian woodland is one of the world's scariest

Australian theme park Dreamworld, in Queensland, boasts a similar machine called the Wipeout - one of the 'Big 7' thrill rides.

Another similar model is the Hurricane at Mexico's Six Flags, which moves at a slower speed.

But the ride has plenty of competition for the title of world's scariest ride, according to All You Need Is Lists.

The world's fastest rollercoaster is located at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The Formula Rossa achieves speeds of up to 150 miles per hour.

Meanwhile, Mieders in Austria offers a single-pipe alpine coaster, in which passengers slide down a mountain on a tiny car.

Silver Star in Rust, Germany is the tallest rollercoaster in Europe, using a chain-lift system to slowly draw riders up 239 feet before dropping them at speeds of up to 130 kilometres per hour and 4G vertical forces.
