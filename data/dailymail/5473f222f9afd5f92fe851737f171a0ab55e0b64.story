A teenager's hand was 'almost severed' after another youth attacked him with a machete outside a restaurant in a upmarket part of London last night.

Restaurant staff rushed to help the 18-year-old, who also had a knife, as blood poured from his wrist, splattering the pavement on Upper Street, Islington, at around 6pm.

Another youth, said to be in his late teens, was stabbed in the arm and both were taken to hospital suffering from what police said were 'non-life threatening' injuries.

Violent assault: A teenager's hand was reportedly nearly hacked off in the attack in Islington, north London

Shocking attack: This CCTV footage shows the wounded man holding his left hand as blood pours from it

Restaurant manager Ferat Disha said the blood was 'shooting' out of the youth's wrist after last night's attack

First aid: Staff from a nearby restaurant on Upper Street rushed onto the street to help the bleeding man

They were later both arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

The wounded man was helped by Ferat Disha, manager of the Blue Legume restaurant opposite Islington Town Hall, after he collapsed in the doorway of a nearby shop.

Mr Disha, who ran out with napkins to help staunch the blood flow, said one of the youths had a professional-looking knife, while the other had a machete or axe.

'A lorry driver who saw it all said they charged at each other so maybe they knew each other,' he told the Evening Standard.

'The guy with the axe hit him on the wrist - blood was shooting out of his arm.  His hand was almost off, it was that bad.'

Frederico Perez, manager of the Comedor Steakhouse, said: 'It happened next to the restaurant I work in and the man was cut very, very badly - there was so much blood on the pavement.

'There was a couple eating outside and it happened in front of them.  The manager of the restaurant next door ran out with a white cloth to help because there was just so much blood.'

He added: 'I called an ambulance but somebody else had already called one.  It was such a shocking thing to see - even the senior police said they were shocked by it.'

He said officers had taken his restaurant's CCTV to examine the footage of the incident.

Mr Perez added: 'This is such a nice area - we have never had anything like that happen here before.'

Local councillor Paul Convery said 
the victim had suffered a 'serious laceration to the hand' in what is 
believed to be a gang-related attack.

He added: 'This
 gang on gang attack took place in one of Islingtonâ€™s most crowded 
streets at a time when dozens and dozens of people were returning from 
work and starting to socialise, and that is very worrying.'

Ferat Disha, manager of the Blue Legume, rushed with a cloth to stem the flow of blood from the wound

A Scotland Yard spokesman said both men were in their late teens and said one had suffered 'arm injuries' while the other had 'stab wounds to the back'.

He said a knife had been recovered from the scene and that the force's Trident Gang Crime Command were investigating.

London Ambulance Service said they were called just after 6pm to reports of a stabbing and treated one patient before taking him to hospital.
