This video captures the terrifying nature of life at sea - showing the inside of a cargo ship twist and contort as it passes through a storm in the Indian ocean.

Recorded during severe weather conditions as the Skagen Maersk container travelled from the Suez Canal to Singapore, it shows the effect of huge waves on the interior of the 1,131ft vessel.

The three-minute clip begins with a shot of the gloomy sky and rough, choppy sea. 

The three-minute clip, recorded as the vessel was travelling to Singapore, begins with a shot of stormy seas 

It then shows a large wave crashing into the 1,131ft Skagen Maersk container in the Indian Ocean

It then shows a huge wave hitting the outside of the container, before the viewer is transported inside.

From the stern of the ship, a wave is seen hitting a wall at the end of a long corridor - which causes it to bend and distort.

From below deck, in what is known as the 'engineer's passageway', the floor can be seen jutting up and down and contorting.

The video was recorded by marine engineer Claus Tuxen.

In the clip, he makes it clear that it is normal for ships to be flexible in such conditions - as a stiff vessel would break apart. 

As the waves hit the exterior, the cameraman moves inside to show the impact of the weather condiitons

From the stern of the ship, a shot down a long corridor shows a wave hitting the wall of the cargo vessel

After the impact, the walls bend and contort, but marine engineer Mr Tuxen explains this is normal

Below deck, in the engineer's passageway, the severe conditions cause the floors to jut up and down

The walls can be seen bending but Mr Tuxen says if the ship was too stiff, it would break apart
