Dolphins are known for their intelligence, but it appears this one has even learned how to dance - creating its own hula hoop with the waves of the sea.

Amateur photographer Steve O'Toole was watching a pod of bottlenose dolphins off the coast of southern California when he spotted a lone dolphin appearing to dance in the waves.

Mr O'Toole, who was volunteering on a whale-watching boat when he spotted the pod, took a series of pictures of the dancing dolphin.

When he looked back at the images, taken at eight frames a second, he noticed the dolphin appeared to have formed a hula hoop around its body out of the sea water.

Let's do the twist: The Bottlenose dolphin was pictured by Steve O'Toole twisting through the sea off the southern Californian coast, creating its own water hula hoop

Mr O'Toole, from Aliso Viejo, told the Huffington Post: 'As it leapt out of the water, it started to twist its body along its longitudinal axis, like a ballerina.

'I briefly looked at my camera when I was there, and I knew I had something special in it. It just shows that that Mother Nature constantly surprises us with awe and wonder.'

The picture of the 'Hula Hoop Dolphin' was later posted on the Facebook page of Dana Wharf Whale Watch - the company Mr O'Toole volunteers for - and was soon being spread over the internet.

'The first thought that came to my mind was [it looked like] a tutu. But through popular demand and social media, it became the "hula hoop" dolphin.'

PhD candidate at the Hawai'i Institute of Marine Biology, Alexis Rudd, told the website that spinning is a normal behaviour of a dolphin.

He said: 'Sometimes spinning and leaping behaviors can be associated with trying to knock off animals like remoras that are catching a free ride on the dolphin, but sometimes not. The most likely scenario is that this photographer just got incredibly lucky with the combination of leaping behavior, wave action and photo timing.'
