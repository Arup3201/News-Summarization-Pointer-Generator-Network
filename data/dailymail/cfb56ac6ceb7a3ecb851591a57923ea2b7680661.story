Holidaymakers were left stunned and outraged when armed police officers and soldiers raided a picturesque beach in Thailand – to seize their personal parasols and sunloungers.

The overly dramatic episode played out Phuket amid growing confusion over the rules on beaches where tourists soak up the sun and play in crystal clear waters.

Despite protests from upset tourists, authorities forcefully removed their umbrellas, chairs and cushions at Surin Beach, even though the objects aren’t banned under existing laws.

Despite protests from upset tourists, authorities forcefully removed their belongings from the beach 

Some holidaymakers argued and stubbornly refused to take down their umbrellas while others threw their parasols in the sand in front of officials, according to The Phuket News.

Beach vendors cheered on the tourists during their verbal clash with a force of approximately 20 people.

According to Phuketwan.com, at least three couples had their brollies confiscated and one woman stormed off and vowed to never return.

It said the local mayor, Ma-ann Samran, ordered the seizure of the umbrellas because he was concerned too many of them could become a problem.

But after the task force departed, five members of the Royal Thai Navy arrived to settle everyone down and inform the tourists that they did not break the law and they are permitted to bring their own parasols to the beach, The Phuket News reported.

The confusion apparently stems from the fact that vendors are banned from renting or selling umbrellas or sunloungers near the beach as the local council attempts to eliminate 'clutter'.

Chay Singkaew, a beach vendor, told The Phuket News: ‘We suffer because we haven’t been able to work on the beach for the last four months.

‘We have no money to pay for home mortgages or car payments. Yes or no is the answer we want to hear. We do not want to see the city to allow for other investors to come in and take over our jobs.’
