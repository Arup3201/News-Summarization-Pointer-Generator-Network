The amount of Americans who believe in the legalization of recreation marijuana continues to reach new highs, with a new survey showing that, for the first time ever, a clear majority of the country are in support of the drug.

The latest Gallup survey has shown that 58 per cent of Americans believe that pot should be made legal.

The figures represent a whopping 10 per cent jump in support in just 12 months

Gallup says the poll is proof of the 'unprecedented success' marijuana advocates have amassed over the last 12 months and that the results will likely inspire future legalization efforts.

'Whatever the reasons for Americans' greater acceptance of marijuana, it is likely that this momentum will spur further legalization efforts across the United States,' the Gallup poll analysis said.

The poll surveyed 1,028 Americans by phone between October 3 and 6.

While the majority of those in favor of marijuana were young and liberal, the biggest increase of support came from people who identified as independents.

Some 62 per cent of independents favored legalization in 2013, an increase of 12 per cent on last year.

- 58 per cent of the 1,028 people polled by Gallup said they supported marijuana being made legal for recreational use across the United States

- 53 per cent of people aged 65 and over remain opposed

- Only 35 per cent of Republicans were in support

- Largest increase in support came from Independents, with 62 per cent now in support

- Some 38 per cent of respondents said they had tried marijuana at some point

- In contrast, first Gallup poll on the issue in 1969 showed a support rate of 12 per cent

Republicans remain the only significant voting block opposed to legalization, with 35 per cent in support of the effort.

That is compared to the 65 per cent of Democrats who said they favored legalization.

The poll broke Americans down into five general age groups - 18 to 29, 30 to 49, 50 to 64 and 65 and older.

The only age group generally not in favor of legalization were those aged 65 or older.

Some 53 per cent of that group remain opposed.

Gallup says the overall result of 58 per cent is a stark contrast to the group's first legalization poll in 1969, in which only 12 per cent of respondents said they favored marijuana becoming legal.

The results also showed that 38 per cent of respondents said they had personally tried marijuana.

'Americans are increasingly recognizing that marijuana is less harmful than they’ve been led to believe,' the spokesperson for Marijuana Policy Project, Mason Tvert, told NBC News. 

'I think it’s time to regulate marijuana like alcohol and most Americans appear to agree.

'We’re seeing support for ending prohibition in states across the country and efforts are being made to change state laws.'

Twenty states, plus the District of Columbia, permit marijuana for medical use.

Washington state and Colorado have passed legislation permitting use of the drug in a recreational sense.

Several states are planning legalization ballot initiatives set for 2014, including California, Alaska, Arizona and Oregon.

Other states, including Rhode Island and Hawaii, are planning legalization initiatives for 2016 to coincide with the next presidential election.

Marijuana is still considered an illegal drug by the federal government and is categorized as a hallucinogen by the Drug Enforcement Administration.

President of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, Craig T. Steckler, criticized the Attorney Generals office for saying they will not interfere with marijuana laws passed by state voters.

Currently both Colorado and Washington have passed laws that legalize recreational marijuana

'We have entered a slippery slope that will be hard to turn away from,' he said.

Founder of the Citizens Against Legalizing Marijuana initiative, Carla Lowe, said people were ignorant to the potency and effects of some strands of marijuana being created and made available.

'I’m concerned that these people that are saying that they are favoring legalization are really not aware or knowledgeable about the marijuana that’s out there today,' Ms Lowe  said.

A poll conducted by Pew Research in April found that 52 percent of the country favored legalization.
