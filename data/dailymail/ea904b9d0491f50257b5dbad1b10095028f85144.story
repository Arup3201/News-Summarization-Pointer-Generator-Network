The achievements of famous Manchester United Class of 92 have been well documented – but for every success story there is a hard luck story not far away.

And while the likes of Ryan Giggs, David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers went onto to have great careers at United – Birmingham-born midfielder Richard Flash was not so lucky.

Flash was a highly rated player in the Birmingham area and had trials at both St Andrew’s and Aston Villa – but he caught the eye of United’s Midland scout and went to play for the Manchester Eagles.

The Eagles alumni included both Terry Cooke and David Johnson who both went onto play for United and Flash became the captain of the team. 

But Flash’s career all but ended before it started when he dislocated his knee playing back in Birmingham.

He didn’t tell anyone about the injury as he was under pressure to earn a contract with United.

He told The Bleacher Report: ‘My knee never felt right, but I didn't tell anybody. I was under pressure to earn a United contract, more so because my injury was hampering my game, but I won a two-year contract after a few more trial games. 

Flash came through at United in 1993 - a year behind the likes of Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham Paul Scholes and the Neville brothers

‘I remember seeing Paul Scholes; he was tiny, and I didn't think he was any good. 

‘I moved up to Manchester in 1993, still wearing my brother's boots; I'd always worn his hand-me-downs. I earned £39 per week and lived in digs with David Beckham near the Cliff training ground.

‘Pete Smith, another guy in the digs, didn't get a professional contract and became a postman. I didn't tell anyone about my knee, but I kept picking up niggling little injuries - probably associated with the knee.’ 

Paul Scholes became one of the best midfielders in his generation - but when Flash first saw him he thought he was too small

Injury was not the only problem for Flash and his Class of 93 teammates, twice they were caught drinking by Sir Alex Ferguson and warned about their futures. 

Flash added: ‘The class of '92 were regularly beating us 7-0 in training. I frequently tried to mark Scholes but struggled. I was fast, but I couldn't read the game as quickly as he could. He could turn and leave you for dust.’

His United career never really took off. He played a couple of reserve games and B Team games before being released.

Flash went on to play for Wolves, Watford, Lincoln and Plymouth before calling time on his career in 1999 – the same year the Class of 92 reached their peak winning the Treble.

Flash went to university and did a Masters degree. He now works as the head of the academic department at UCFB - a higher education institution delivering degrees in sports and the football industries - based in Burnley and Wembley.

Looking back on his career, Flash added: ‘I look back at my football career with positive and negative feelings. I should have sorted my knee out when I first did it. I played too much in my early teens, and that led to an injury, but I made good friends at football and learned much, which helps with my current job.’
