At a staggering 16ft long, it's little wonder that this crocodile needs a substantial meal to satisfy him when he's hungry.

But as these stunning pictures show, even a whole pigs head isn't too much for this giant beast to stomach.

The saltwater crocodile, whose name translates to Too Long in English, was snapped during feeding time at a crocodile park in Pasay City, Manila.

The hungry reptile feasted on the pig's head which weighed in at 6.5kg.

The meaty meal was hardly an unusually large feast for a saltwater croc, with the species known to eat whatever they can clamp their jaws around.

The fierce predators have been known to eat anything from water buffalo, monkeys, wild boar and even sharks.

The species, which is native to saltwater areas of eastern India, south east Asia and northern Australia, is even said by some to be the animal most likely to eat a human.

Saltwater crocodiles lurk just beneath the surface of the water and pounce without warning.

They tend to use their tails and powerful jaw to spring from the water, grab their prey and drag them beneath the surface.

The creature then holds its victim under the water until it drowns.

Saltwater crocodiles can live for up to 70 years and grow to an average of 17ft, weighing around 1,000lbs.

But 23ft long crocodiles are not unheard of.

An official at the crocodile park in Manila, where Too Long is kept, said that he is the largest species at the park.
