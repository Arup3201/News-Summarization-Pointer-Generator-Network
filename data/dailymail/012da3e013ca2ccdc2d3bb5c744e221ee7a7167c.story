Arsenal have announced the signing of Colombia goalkeeper David Ospina from Nice on a long-term contract.

The 25-year-old, who impressed as Colombia reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in Brazil, has moved to the Emirates Stadium for an undisclosed fee.

Gunners manager Arsene Wenger told Arsenal's official website: 'David Ospina is an excellent goalkeeper, with good experience and a proven record of performing with Nice and Colombia.

'He will add strength to our squad and we are very pleased that he will be joining us.'

The 25-year-old joins the north London side on a reported four-year deal for £3.2million.

Shortly after the announcement, Ospina posted a message on his Twitter account translated as: 'The race closes with a wonderful Nice cycle and a dream fulfilled upon arrival at Arsenal. Thank you Nissarts, Go Gunners'.

The keeper is expected to make his first appearance for Arsenal during the Emirates Cup friendly tournament, which takes place in north London next weekend.

Ospina made 189 Ligue 1 appearances over six years with Nice having joined the south coast club from Colombian club Atletico Nacional in 2008.

He made his senior debut for Atletico aged just 17 and has been a full Colombia international since 2007, making his first start for Los Cafeteros in a 2010 World Cup qualification match against Bolivia.

At Arsenal he will provide competition for first-choice keeper Wojciech Szczesny while helping to fill the gap left by the departed Lukasz Fabianski, who has joined Swansea.

Nice coach Claude Puel on Saturday night confirmed Ospina's move to London had been ratified and told Gunners fans they could expect some 'quality' displays from the new signing.

Speaking to Sky Sports News after Nice's friendly defeat to Brentford, Puel said: 'It's confirmed, yes.

'It's a good affair for Arsenal because he's a very good player. You will see next season the quality of this player.

'It's fantastic for him. It's important for him to try another league, another club and Arsenal is a fantastic club for him.

'David Ospina can take the goalkeeping position at Arsenal because his qualities are very strong and... 'magnifique'. You saw in the World Cup how important a goalkeeper he is.

For me, David can impose his quality, he's a goalkeeper who is very good with the feet, with his arms, he knows football and he's a very, very good player.'

Another player expected to move to the Emirates Stadium is Southampton defender Calum Chambers, with a £16million deal understood to be under discussion.

It was believed that the 25-year-old was initially pinpointed as a ready-made replacement for back-up keeper Lukasz Fabianski, who recently joined Swansea, with Wojciech Szczesny the current No 1 at the club.

However,
 Arsene Wenger has insisted that performances will dictate who holds the
 No 1 position this season at the club, as Ospina looks to stake a claim
 for a first-team spot.

'You know at the start Szczensy will be 
the No. 1, then again it will be down to performances and, if Ospina shows
 that he is better, he will play,' he told ESPN.

Ospina 
will join Alexis Sanchez and Mathieu Debuchy as new signings at the 
Emirates next season, while the club has also been linked with a move 
for Porto's £35 million-rated defensive midfielder William Carvalho.

Wenger
 believes that the new additions the club has made now means they will 
make a sustained challenge for the Premier League title this season, 
after falling somewhat short over the last few years.

Speaking at a press conference ahead of his side's pre-season friendly with New York Red Bulls, Wenger agreed that Arsenal were looking to repeat the success they have enjoyed in the past.

'That's what our target is but still I think we have been very consistent,' he said.

'It was a very different period initially because we built a new stadium and had to pay it back. We survived at the top level but we want more.

'We are now on an even ground with the other clubs than we were five or six years ago.'
