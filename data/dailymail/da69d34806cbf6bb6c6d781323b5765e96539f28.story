A French court today ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users to the police.

In a test case which will have widespread implications for the millions who tweet every day, the Tribunal de Grande Instance ruled it unacceptable for people to post hateful material anonymously.

This was despite lawyers for the hugely popular micro-blogging site refusing to assist detectives.

Offensive: A French court has ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users after the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew) went viral in France last year

Jewish students brought the case, saying Twitter had a moral duty to name and shame hateful posters.

It follows a massive increase in the number of anti-Semitic tweets appearing across France.

In October, the student bodies asked Twitter to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew), with vicious examples including: '#agoodjew is a dead Jew.’

The hashtag became the third most popular in France, with thousands attacking the religion.

France, which has a shameful history of 
anti-Semitism behind it, now has a number of strict laws aimed at 
combatting hate crimes.

The Union of Jewish Students of France (UEJF) and three other similar groups now want Twitter to hand over the names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted.

Alexandre Neri, Twitter’s French barrister, had told the court that Twitter 'data is collected and stored in the United States’ – namely in San Francisco, where the site is based.

Ms Neri said that Twitter was accordingly 'subject to US law’, adding: 'Should I submit myself to the law of a different country to where I work? I don’t know.’

Suggesting that there was a 'huge void, a question mark’ in the law, Ms Neri suggested that only an American judge could decide whether a US company should hand over data to the French authorities.

Stephane Lilti, counsel for the Jewish groups, in turn said Twitter had a 'commerical interest’ in protecting the anonymity of its users.

'Twitter is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations,’ said Mr Lilti.

Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud handed down the verdict following deliberations lasting two weeks.

Last year, Twitter shut down an account run by a German neo-Nazi group based in Hanover, following a request by German police. Facebook and YouTube complied with similar requests.

Before today’s ruling, a spokesman for Twitter said it always suspends accounts when they are illegal, or in breach of its rules, but would not hand over details of account holders unless ordered by a judge.
