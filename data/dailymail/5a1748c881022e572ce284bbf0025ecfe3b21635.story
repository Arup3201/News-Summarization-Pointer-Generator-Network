Eighteen months after bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev inflicted terror on the city of Boston, his widow has been pictured quietly settling into her new life in New Jersey.

Stony-faced as she carries out her daily chores, Katherine Russell has been pictured out and about in North Bergen, where she and her three-year-old daughter, Zahara, are reportedly living with her husband's sisters. Zahara was just a baby when her father caused unthinkable tragedy on April 15, 2013.

As the images show, Russell, 25, continues to wear a hijab, proving that she is still living a strict Muslim life despite rumors that her family was pushing her to embrace Christianity after the attacks.

And rather than shun her husband's family, WCVB discovered in August that she had moved in with his sisters Ailina and Bella.

The women were found  living in a nondescript blue house in North Bergen, which is located about 10 miles west of Manhattan and 200 miles from Boston.

It was also reported earlier this year that she had remarried and had another baby, but there were no signs of the child this week. 

Ailina and Bella's 20-year-old brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, is currently awaiting federal trial for his role in the 2013 bombing that killed three people and left more than 260 others wounded.

The two ethnic Chechen brothers from southern Russia were accused of planting two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line. 

The search for the brothers lasted days, but after they shot dead MIT officer Sean Collier and fled, they were cornered by police officers in Watertown.

A gun battle ensued and Tamerlan was killed. Dzhokhar hit him as he fled in their getaway car, but the younger brother was captured hiding in a tarp-covered boat in a resident's backyard.

He was hospitalized with injuries but later charged with using a weapon of mass destruction to kill. His trial is set for November.

Russell grew up Christian in the North Kingston, Rhode Island, home of a suburban doctor.

At home: She reportedly lives with her husband's two sisters at the home in North Bergen

In 2010, the promising young artist and good student dropped out of college, converted to Islam and married Tamerlan, whom she had met at a nightclub. The couple had a daughter.

The young family moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where they settled in a cramped apartment and attended prayers in a Boston Islamic center.

After her husband's death, Russell went to live with her parents in Rhode Island. They reportedly tried to convince her to stop being so strict about her faith. 

Russell's attorney Amato DeLuca claimed his client first learned that her husband was suspected of being a terrorist from news reports on TV.

DeLuca said Russell had no reason to suspect her husband of anything and was focused on supporting her family, working 70 to 80 hours, seven days a week as a home health care aide.

Russell has never spoken publicly about the  bombings and she was never charged in relation to the plot, although a grand jury looking into the bombings spoke with her family members.
