'Lady in the Lake' killer Gordon Park read an official report into the prison suicide of mass murderer Harold Shipman more than a year before he was found dead in his own cell in Lancashire, an inquest has heard.

Park was jailed for life in 2005 for murdering his teacher wife Carol with an ice axe 30 years earlier - ending what had been one of Britain's most notorious unsolved cases.

But the killer was found hanged in his cell at HMP Garth, Lancashire, on January 25, 2010 - the morning of his 66th birthday.

Inquest: Convicted murderer Gordon Park, pictured left, was found dead in his cell at HMP Garth in Lancashire in 2010 - a year after he read a report into how serial killer Harold Shipman, right, committed suicide in prison

Carol Park vanished in July 1976, but her badly beaten, weighted-down body was found dumped in Coniston Water, in the Lake District in 1997.

Her husband was eventually convicted of her murder following a trial - but always maintained his innocence.

At an inquest into his death at Preston Coroner’s Court today heard that prison staff became concerned about his mental state and put Park on prison suicide watch in July 2008.

Around the same time, he had asked his third wife Jenny to send him the Prison and Probation Ombudsman’s report into serial killer GP Dr Harold Shipman’s suicide in Wakefield prison.

According to Mrs Park, her husband 'didn’t think it was necessary' to be on the watch but did not discuss with his wife why he wanted the Shipman report.

Staff at HMP Garth the opened a second report into the state of his mind when his appeal against his conviction failed in November 2008.

The lady in the lake: Carol Park vanished in 1976 but her body was found dumped in Coniston Water in the Lake District more than 10 years later in 1997

His wife - who married her husband in 1993 - told the inquest: 'He was very concerned about the appeal and I was very worried that if the appeal failed he might take his own life.

'It was the fact that if the appeal failed he would not want to continue living in prison because he could see no future for him to be released.'

Mrs Park said this was discussed during their regular telephone calls, but that he 'settled down' again after a few weeks.

The inquest heard how Park seemed 'shocked' by the decision and began giving his possessions away to other inmates.

But Park told concerned prison officers that he was just 'having a clear out' and was taken off suicide watch again in December 2008.

Mrs Park said that her husband was a 'very religious man' and enjoyed visits from a friendly pastor, George Harrison, of the Pendlebury Evangelical Church in Swinton, Manchester, while incarcerated.

Mystery: Park was arrested following the discovery by divers of his wife's body in the beauty spot Lake Coniston but was not tried and convicted of her murder until 2005

Mr Harrison had housed the Parks during his 10-week trial at Manchester Crown Court in 2005.

But when Mr Harrison’s visits were abruptly stopped by prison bosses in December 2009, Mrs Park said it seemed like 'the final straw' for her husband.

She told the inquest: 'He gained something from those visits that I couldn’t give him. I don’t know what that was.

'He just couldn’t understand it [when the visits were stopped]. His whole demeanour when I saw him was that this was the last straw really.

'It was another thing he had no control over and couldn’t do anything about.

'He seemed much sadder somehow. He was not as interested in anything said to him or going on around him.'

The Parks launched another appeal to the Criminal Courts Review Commission, which Mrs Park told the inquest was her husband’s 'only hope'.

But he was found dead on January 25, 2010.

Evidence: Park's widow and third wife Jenny, pictured left leaving Preston Coroners Court today, told the inquest she became concerned about the mental state of her husband Gordon, pictured together right outside Manchester Crown Court in 2004, after he lost his appeal against his murder conviction in 2008

Mrs Park said: 'It was a huge shock.'

Coroner Dr James Adeley asked her what the significance was of Park choosing his 66th birthday to apparently commit suicide.

She replied: 'I think it was so I would not have two days to remember'.Asked by Mr Harrison - who is acting as the family’s advocate - what Park found difficult about prison, Mrs Park replied: 'The regime, the routine, not seeing his family, the lack of freedom, lack of hope.'The inquest is due to last four days and will hear from the Prison and Probation Ombudsman report into Park’s death.Mrs Park was supported in court by Park’s son Jeremy, now 42, from his marriage with Carol.

However the family have chosen not to stay for the rest of the inquest and left the court following Mrs Park’s evidence.

The retired schoolmaster was accused of bludgeoning his wife Carol to death with an ice axe in July 1976 and dumping her body in the lake near the family home in Leece, near Barrow-in-Furness.

Notorious: The murder of 'lady in the lake' Carol Park remained one of Britain's most well-known unsolved murder cases for many years

He claimed he had taken their children on a trip to Blackpool on the day she vanished to live with another man when she was aged 30.

Her body had come to rest on an underwater ledge and was found by amateur divers 11 years later.

She was found wearing her blue baby doll night-dress, arms bound tightly and with tape over her eyes.

Park was arrested and charged with her murder but the case against him was dropped in January 1998 when the Crown Prosecution Service said it did not have enough evidence against him.

A second police investigation uncovered fresh evidence by linking him to the killing with the knots meticulously used to tie up the body and a piece of Westmorland green slate used to weigh it down that matched the stone used to build the family home.

The 2005 guilty verdict at Manchester Crown Court brought an end to one of Britain’s most notorious unsolved murders.

Park was jailed for life to serve a minimum of 15 years.

However, Park had always maintained his innocence and wrote letters to the media from jail. His family, including third wife Jenny and his children Jeremy and Rachel have continued campaigned for his conviction to be overturned posthumously.

The case became known as ‘Lady in the Lake’ after the Raymond Chandler novel of the same name.
