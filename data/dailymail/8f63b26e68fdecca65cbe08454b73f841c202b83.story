Chelsea are keeping tabs on AFC Wimbledon's prolific teenage striker Daniel Agyei.

The 17-year-old, who plays for the Dons' Under 18's side, has been on fire this season, already scoring 22 goals.

Despite his tender age, Agyei is already pushing for a place in the club's Under 21 set-up.

However, his goalscoring exploits have not gone unnoticed by AFC Wimbledon's local rivals, with Chelsea understood to be making regular checks on the teenager.

Fulham are also said to be monitoring Agyei's progress.

Agyei remains happy with AFC, but any decision on a potential move will be made based on what he and his advisors feel is best for his football progression.

Assurances of fast-tracking the youngster into the U21 set-up - and then possibly the senior squad within the next 12 months or as early as the end of the season - could help persuade Agyei to stay at the League Two side.

However, the attraction of joining established academies at Chelsea and Fulham could be too good an opportunity to refuse.
