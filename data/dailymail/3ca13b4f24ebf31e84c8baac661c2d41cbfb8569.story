A Romanian man involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims has walked free from court today.

Leonid Rotaru helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them.

Police said they discovered 9,000 
different card accounts on a computer seized during the criminal 
investigation.

Scam: Leonid Rotaru, front right was involved in a sophisticated bank card fraud thought to be worth in excess of £3 million and with 9,000 potential victims. He is pictured walking free from court today

Detectives estimated that the network to which Rotaru belonged had 
access to at least £3 million, based on the average fraud per card for 
typical skimming offences.

After he was convicted of his part in the scam, the 32-year-old was given an 18-month jail term, suspended for two years, at Taunton Crown Court.

Speaking outside the court, Avon and Somerset Police civilian investigator Barrie Douglas said: 'The potential in these cases is always for a lot of money to be made.

'Banks say the average (fraud) per card is around £460.'

Asked whether he was content with the sentence handed down to Rotaru, Mr Douglas said: 'That’s for the courts to decide, it’s not for me.'

The court heard that father-of-two Rotaru had been living legally in the country for three years.

Criminal: The 32-year-old helped to fit 'skimming' devices on cash dispensers, which downloaded the card details of those who used them

His role in the scam was to fit the 
discreet skimming device to a cash machine, which was later removed and 
used to download the card details relevant to each unwitting victim’s 
account.

Those details were then sent on an email to another man.

Rotaru told police he was 'at the bottom end' of the operation, and that the 'big boys operated out of London'.

However, he refused to explain why he had not given their names to police as he left the court a free man today. He also refused to say who received the card detail emails.

Judge Graham Hume Jones told Rotaru: 'This is a sophisticated scam by which a number of people could have been victims.

'Even if they had been repaid by the banks, the banks themselves would have been the victims, and ultimately the banks’ customers.'

The court heard Rotaru skipped bail while under investigation for one such fraud, in Axminster, Devon, in 2011.

He was eventually convicted by a jury after his DNA was discovered inside the inner components of the tiny device.

Rotaru
was later apprehended when he was spotted by police in Minehead at an 
ATM which security staff thought had also been tampered with. He was 
arrested and initially gave a false name.

The court heard that Rotaru had 'changed his attitude' while on remand.

He was sentenced today for four counts of possessing an article for use in fraud and one count of possessing/controlling a false/ improperly obtained identification card.

Rotaru, of Bridgwater in Somerset, was also ordered to carry out 150 hours’ community service.
