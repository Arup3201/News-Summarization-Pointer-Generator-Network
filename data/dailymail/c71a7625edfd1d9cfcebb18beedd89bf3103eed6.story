A British engineer and his scientist workmate have been killed after they attempted to cross a crocodile-infested river in India.

Ian Turton, 45, from York, and Michael Easton, 62, from west London, both drowned after their raft hit some rocks, overturned and was swept away in the rapids on the Cauvery River near Bangalore, police said.

The river is also said to be infested with crocodiles, leading to speculation the men could have been attacked as they travelled down it.

Police superintendent Anupam Agarwal said police divers removed the bodies of the two men from the river today.

He added the men's families have been notified and the bodies were being sent home.

Mr Turton was working for Tenneco Automotive, an American company, while Mr Easton was a research scientist with the energy giant Shell.

Today tributes were paid to Mr Turton by his employer. 

Sandro Paparelli, vice president and general manager of Tenneco Ride Control Europe, said: 'Ian was a valued member of our advanced manufacturing and engineering team and worked in a variety of Tenneco locations to support the company's international expansion.

Adventurer: Mr Turton's brother Nigel described him as a 'very resourceful, adventurous man'

Loved: Sandro Paparelli, vice president and general manager of Tenneco Ride Control Europe, described Mr Turton as 'a much appreciated colleague'

'He was a much appreciated colleague and leaves many friends all over the Tenneco world.

'We are all profoundly saddened by this tragic loss of life and extend our deepest sympathies to Ian's family and friends.'

Yesterday Mr Turton's brother Nigel described him as a 'very resourceful, adventurous man'.

The 497-mile Cauvery River runs across three southern Indian states, including Tamil Nadu, where Mr Turton is reported to have been working for Tenneco.

An Indian colleague of Mr Turtons at Tenneco filed a police report on Tuesday saying the two men, who were friends had met up at the Lord's Plaza hotel in Bangalore before setting off with a driver at 6am on Saturday. 

The driver said the men carried a large travel bag in which he saw an inflatable boat and some life jackets.

Theory: The Cauvery River is said to be infested with crocodiles, leading to speculation the men could have been attacked as they travelled down it

They had used a hand held GPS system to direct the driver about 50 miles south to the river Cauvery and told him to meet them back at the hotel in Bangalore at 7am on Monday. Neither men appeared at the rendezvous.

Rescuers told local media that the raft was found on a part of the river known as the 'ten chakras' where the water is forced into a gorge with a small but powerful waterfall.

Local rafting event organizer PG Bharat told the Times of India that the crocodile population in the gorge increases in the drier summer months: 'If a raft hits a crocodile float, there is every chance of rafters getting caught by these carnivores,' he said.
