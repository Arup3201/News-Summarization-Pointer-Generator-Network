Arrested: The child's father Terrell Williams

A three-year-old girl was left needing a skin graft after she was held under scalding water for wetting her pants.

Police arrested her father, Terrell Williams, 28, his girlfriend, Kenyatta Gill, 31, and Gill's brother, Aaron Alston, 25.

All three live in the Phoenix home where the incident happened along with Gill's three-month-old daughter, documents stated.

The unidentified child was taken to a Valley hospital on December 12.

Gill is suspected of placing the girl in a tub of hot water on December 9, after the child had urinated in her clothing, court documents stated according to azcentral.com.

She said she turned on the hot and cold water and may not have turned the cold water on enough.

According to the documents, Williams said heard the girl scream for at least seven minutes before he went to check on her.

Under investigation: As well as the child's father police arrested his girlfriend, Kenyatta Gill, 31, left, and Gill's brother, Aaron Alston, 25

Alston said he was aware of the burn and
that the girl was in bed for two days following the incident with chills.

He also said she need help eating and going to the bathroom.

The young girl's burns were treated with ibuprofen, gauze and antiseptic spray until she was eventually taken to hospital several days later.
