The 40-year-old mother wanted for murdering her two-year-old daughter was found Sunday night and arrested off a remote coastal logging road in Oregon.

Canon Beach, Oregon police held a press conference Sunday night, saying they found Jessica Smith with the help of the coast guard, parked at the end of a logging road off Highway 26. She did not appear armed or injured and is set to be arraigned in Clatsop County court on Monday at 1pm.

Smith went missing Friday morning, after her toddler daughter Isabella Smith was found dead and her 13-year-old daughter Alana Smith seriously injured in a Canon Beach hotel room.

Found: Jessica Smith, 40, was arrested Sunday night for allegedly murdering her two-year-old daughter Isabella. She was found in her car at the end of a remote logging road, two days after her daughter's death

She was in the middle of a bitter divorce with husband Greg Smith at the time, and was supposed to hand her children over to him that day.

At a 
Sunday night press conference, police issued a statement on behalf of 
the family. They said they were 'working through a difficult time' and 
asked for privacy.

The
 search warrant issued earlier Sunday said Smith was wanted for 
aggravated murder and attempted aggravated murder in the assault of 13-year-old Alana, who suffered life-threatening injuries.

Custody battle: Smith was in the process of a divorce and was supposed to be dropping her children off with her estranged husband the day she allegedly killed her two-year-old and attempted to kill her 11-year-old

Two-year-old Isabella did not show signs of physical abuse, with no apparent injuries.

'It's hard to know with a child that size,' Schermerhorn told KATU. 'They need to await a toxicology report.'

Alana Smith has undergone surgery and is
 in a stable condition at OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital, 
Schermerhorn said. She has not yet been interviewed by detectives.

She has been 
informed that her mother was found.

KPTV reported
 Smith's husband, Greg Smith, 'filed to end their marriage on June 30. 
She then filed a restraining order against him on July 17.'

She was under court order to return the girls to him the day they were discovered in the hotel room.

A housekeeper discovered the Smith's two daughters in a third-story room at the Surfsand Resort about 9:40am Friday.

Oregon Live reports that Alana Smith was able to give basic information to officers before she was flown to a Portland hospital.

The family had been booked into the hotel since Wednesday.

Greg Smith is not considered a suspect, and authorities say he has cooperated with the investigation.

Day in court: Smith is set to be arraigned Monday afternoon

'There are no other suspects,' Schermerhorn said. 

Greg Smith requested a mental evaluation for Jessica Smith from the court after she missed a June 23 court hearing, reports Oregon Live.

He had received strange text messages from his estranged wife that concerned him. It is not known if Jessica Smith was suffering from a psychological issue.

Smith's brother Nathan Judd revealed to KPTV that she recently visited him in southern Medford, Oregon, bringing her two daughters along and seemed in good spirits.

Judd said Smith was 'super happy and outgoing, all smiles' but 'sensed a lot of fear' in her as well.

She admitted to struggling with the divorce and asked for a place to keep her pets.

'I can't imagine that my sister would ever do something like that,' Judd said of the murder charges.'She had a heart of gold, and growing up, she never harmed anyone or anything and never spoke of such a thing.'

Smith was last seen driving this 2007 Chevrolet Suburban with Washington APX3141 plates

Police began hunting for Jessica Smith after her two children were found by housekeeping at the Surfsand Resort, Oregonlive.com reported.

'Housekeeping
 at the hotel had found a 13-year-old child that had critical cuts and a
 deceased infant,' Schermerhorn said in a release. The 13-year-old, later identified as Alana Smith, was 
flown to a hospital, he said.

Police earlier said Smith may be in 'a Gold 2007 Chevy Suburban with WA license plate APX3141 associated with the incident.'

'Our hearts go out to the family and it's always hard when there's children involved,' Schermerhorn said in a Friday press conference.

Schermerhorn
 told reporters Smith checked into the Surfsand Resort on July 30, and 
the two girls were discovered Friday morning at 9:40am.

There were no signs of forced entry into the hotel room, he said.

Schermerhorn said he could not provide a 
time of death for the baby girl. Alana went into surgery,
 he told reporters.  

The attack on Alana Smith is being ruled an attempted homicide.

'We don't know at this time what [weapons were used],' Schermerhorn said.
