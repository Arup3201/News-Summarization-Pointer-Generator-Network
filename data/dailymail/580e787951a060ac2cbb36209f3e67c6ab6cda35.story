Accused killer: Ruben Renderos, 18, is accused of stabbing his younger brother multiple times

A Long Island teen planning to commit suicide attempted to stab to death his younger brother so he would not be lonely, police said.

Ruben Renderos, 18, has been charged with attempted murder after repeatedly stabbing his 14-year-old brother in their Williston Park apartment.

Renderos stabbed him in the back, head and chest, police said.

The older brother left his younger sibling for dead when he bolted their grim apartment building wedged between two auto shops on a busy suburban street corner.

Cops snagged the violent boy a short while later as his brother was taken to a local hospital, said authorities.

The victim is in stable condition, Renderos was arraigned Saturday on one charge of attempted murder.

It is not clear if Renderos is still in Nassau County Jail or if he made bail.

Also not clear is whether Renderos had a prior history of violence or mental problems, MailOnline was not able to reach family members or local authorities for further comment.
