Nigel Farage flew half way round the world to address America's leading conservative conference last night - but hardly anyone turned up to listen.

The Ukip leader flew to Washington to address the gathering of hardcore activists before catching a ‘red eye’ flight home overnight to get back in time for this afternoon's Ukip conference in Margate.

But Mr Farage was handed the 'graveyard' speaking slot at the end of the day and was forced to address an audience of just 250 in a convention centre with a capacity for over 5,000.

Nigel Farage flew to Washington to address America's leading conservative conference - but hardly anyone showed up to listen

Mr Farage delivered his speech to row after row of empty chairs just an hour after the hall had been packed for a speech by Sarah Palin, the darling of Tea Party conservatives. 

The Conservative Political Action Conference is an annual three-day mecca for Tea Party campaigners, anti-abortion opponents and gun rights activists. 

Mr Farage warned the Republican gathering that they risked becoming dinosaurs like the Conservatives in the UK if they continued to embrace the political centre.

Mr Farage slammed David Cameron over his failure to identify the infamous ISIS executioner 'Jihadi John.'

'Of course they should have told us his name,' he said. 'We should have heard it weeks ago. This information's been known for a long time.'

He also claimed the name was leaked to cover yesterday's immigration figures. 

'By sheer coincidence,' he said, Emwazi's name was published 'on the day when the government has to announce the worst immigration figures ever seen in the history of the United Kingdom.'

'WE'RE NOT THE TEA PARTY': Nigel Farage, whose UK Independence Party is challenging both Tories and Liberals, said his is a real political force, not just an influence group trying to reform a wayward party

He also hit out against CAGE, the British NGO that often advocates on behalf of radicalized Muslims and brands their detractors 'Islamophobes.'

'Yes, yes, yes!' Farage exploded when asked if the group was an embarrassment to most Britons. 'It's politcal correctness! 

'I mean, we see protests on a regular basis with these groups on the streets of London saying and shouting things that – if you and I did them, we'd find ourselves behind bars in very short order.'

'We actually have a Judeo-Christian culture,' he added. 'It's actually in our Constitution, so let's stand up for it.'

Is that xenophobic? Farage doesn't think so.

'The thing about us,' he said of the UK, 'is that we have been, of all the European countries, the most tolerant of all different religions and all different groups who have come to Britain.'

While 'private observance' of any religion 'is fine,' he insisted, 'unless we live under one law we're in trouble.'

Mr Farage said the Republican Party was 'going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'.

Ukip, he boasted, was 'an insurgent political force that has taken on the political establishment and rocked them to the backs of their heels.'

But he said: 'We're not the tea party. Our job is not to influence one political party. We're not an outlier from the Tories.'

And unlike the tea party phenomenon, which peels off disaffected Republicans who believe their traditional party has moved too far left, he said, his group 'is not just retired half-colonels who've always voted Conservative and now they're UKIP. We're dragging them from across the spectrum.' 

Mr Farage also attacked Mr Obama - claiming he sees 'an American president who doesn't have the courage' to fight against Islamist terror.

Mr Obama, he claimed, lacks the vision to see 'what has gone wrong, and why those three people were arrested on the streets of the USA yesterday.'

That was a reference to the trio of Muslim men who were detained by the FBI after they began the process of traveling to Syria for training with the ISIS terror army – with the intention of bringing death and destruction back to America. 

'We must stand firm and defend our Judeo-Christian culture,' Farage said, earnign his first boisterous applause. 'We must make it clear that we believe in common law and not Shariah law.'

He called radical Islam 'an enemy within' both the US and the UK.

Farage said 'the Republican Party is going through the same crisis of identity as the Conservative Party in Britain'

'If you discuss immigration, it means you're a bad person,' he complained to a thousand convention-goers – 'that you harbor dislike or hatred or prejudice of somebody else'

CPAC's lineup includes Sarah Palin, whose teleprompter played tricks on her last month in Iowa, leaving her rambling for minutes

The CPAC conference draws conservatives from all over the US, but they share the same message

Like any political force testing its boundaries by casting a wide net, it would be recognizable to American conservatives who have had to contend with their own brand of bad publicity.

Todd Akin, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, famously self-imploded after musing on whether abortions should be allowed in cases of 'legitimate rape.'

Sarah Palin just last month lost track of her teleprompter during a key Iowa speech and rambled aimlessly for what seemed like hours, causing some to wonder if she was intoxicated.

An ocean away, UKIP councillor Rozanne Duncan was kicked out this month after she was filmed saying she has 'a problem with people with negroid features.'

And social media accounts belonging to UKIP activist Richard Crouch were plastered recently with claims that his home town of Leicester is a 'sh*thole' and 'full of P***s.'

His Facebook account called Asians 'The Taliban' and labeled Romanians 'pick pocketing criminals.'

Crouch insisted that his account was hacked, but the damage was done.

Farage threw up his hands and suggested that idiots will be idiots. 

'Well, look,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'people like Rozanne Duncan are local councillors. They are very low-level people in UKIP. They're not major players.'

'Yes, we get people who say stupid things in UKIP. I don't approve or condone any of it.'
