Historic: John Lambert, 68, found a fossil from 250million years ago in 1997. But put it in his shed

It's not every day someone finds the priceless bone of a dinosaur-aged sea killer in their garden.

But when 68-year-old John Lambert came across a pliosaur fossil while building a fence in 1997, he was in no rush to do anything about it.

The retired merchant banker, who lives in Ipswich, put the fossil in his shed - and left it there for 16 years.

Finally, he decided to take it to Ipswich Museum last week, where experts, astounded, confirmed it to be the bone of a 250-million-year-old reptile.

The 16-inch bone, thought to be an upper limb, weighs 15lbs.

Mr Lambert said he put it in the shed as he could tell it was worth keeping - but getting it checked out was never a priority.

'Life get's on top of you doesn't it,' he said.

'It did look like a really big bone that was tremendously heavy and I had earmarked that I would take it for identification but never did.

'Then one day I thought, "what happened to that bone?" and I found it in the workshop.

'I phoned the museum and they said "bring it in, we'd love to have a look at it".'

The pliosaur, a 65-foot-long sea-based predator, was a distant cousin of the modern lizard.

With sharp teeth and paddle-like limbs, they were fast and fierce, scientists believe.

Their prey included fish, sharks and dinosaurs.

Fossil specimen have been found in Africa, Australia, China, and the Americas.

Experts at the Ipswich Museum have determined that the pliosaur was not native to the English sea, making the finding even more mysterious.

Mr Lambert said: 'It is rather fun.

'I've been here 29 years and we've got eight acres of ground.

'We're keen on the gardening side and I can honestly say we've found nothing whatsoever of any kind of value apart from rubbish, so it's really fun to have found this.

'It will probably go to the museum now.

'Although it's not from Suffolk, in that it wasn't swimming around here, it is part of Suffolk's heritage.'
