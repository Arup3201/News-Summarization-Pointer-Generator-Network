FA chairman Greg Dyke believes English football must adopt similar approach to NFL's Rooney Rule in an attempt to address the lack of black coaches and managers.

Of the 92 teams that make up the Premier League and Football League, just two sides employ black managers - Huddersfield's Chris Powell and Keith Curle at Carlisle.

The Rooney Rule, used in the NFL since 2003, says that teams must interview at least one black or ethnic minority candidate when hiring a head coach.

Of the 32 teams in the NFL, four have black head coaches in charge - Mike Tomlin at the Pittsburgh Steelers, Lovie Smith at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Jim Caldwell at the Detroit Lions and Marvin Lewis at the Cincinnati Bengals.

And Dyke believes something needs to be done to tackle the lack of black and ethnic minority coaches and managers in the English game.

When asked about implementing the Rooney Rule in English football, Dyke told CNN: 'It has to happen.'

He added: 'You go anywhere in the country to watch football now and there's a disproportionate amount of ethnic minorities and yet why are they not coming through the game?

'We've got an inclusion group looking at whether the Rooney Rule would work. We apply the Rooney Rule when we're applying for coaches. You need to know it's going to work.'
