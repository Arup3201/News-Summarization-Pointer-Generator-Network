On a day when his signature health care program suffered the latest in a series of website outages, President Barack Obama made one last 2013 pitch to a standing-room-only thong of journalists who have engaged lately in more knife-sharpening than hero-worship.

He tried to tee up a series of economic achievements, noting the addition of 'another 2 million jobs, adding up to 8 million in just over the past 45 months.'

We head into next year with an economy that is stronger than it was when we started the year,' he insisted,' with unemployment 'the lowest in 5 years' and budget deficits that have fallen to half their 20078 levels.

'I firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.'

His economic policies, Obama predicted, would bring 'bigger paychecks for middle-class families' in the new year.

Then, a surprise: More than 1 million Americans, Obama announced, have enrolled in Obamacare-based insurance plans plans through federal and state marketplaces this month. That includes '15,000 a day in California,' he said, and 'tens of thousands' each day on healthcare.gov.

A cheerful Obama put a positive spin on his fifth year in office as reporters peppered him about the public-opinion disasters he's suffered during 2013

'For all the challenges we've had ... more than half a million Americans have enrolled in healthcare.gov through the first three weeks of December alone,' Obama said.

A White House official added on background that more than 1 million people have entered the ranks of the insured during December, if both the federal and state exchanges are included.

And Obama later said millions of Americans, 'whether they know it or not,' had already benefited from the Affordable Care Act, including 'a couple of million' who will have health insurance on January 1.

But estimates of Americans who have lost insurance because their policies didn't meet the law's strict benefit requirements range from 5 to 15 million. The Department of Health and Human Services insists that the number is less than 500,000.

It's unclear how many of those enrollees have selected taxpayer-subsidized Medicaid coverage, as did a large majority of Americans represented in the Department of Health and Human Services' numbers through the end of November.

It's also unknown whether the administration can continue adding enrollees at a fast enough pace to reach its goal of more than 7 million by the end of March, including 2.7 million Americans under age 35.

But few people likely signed up on Friday, as the main Obamacare portal experienced crashes and again demonstrated an inability to keep up with a year-end crush of traffic brought on as uninsured Americans panicked.

Obama made the rare appearance in the White House's James Brady Press Briefing Room just hours before departing for a lengthy family vacation in Hawaii.

It's been a rough year for the 
president, with his approval ratings in a seemingly one-way slump and 
members of Congress from his own party, sensing his short electoral 
coat-tails next November, deserting him on issues as varied as Iran and 
Obamacare.

Thirteen Senate 
Democrats joined the same number of Republicans on Friday in filing a 
bill that would authorize tough new sanctions on Iran at the same time 
Obama's State Department is counseling diplomacy and patience with the 
Islamic republic's leader, Hassan Rouhani.

And between a website that once again is failing to function and the White House's latest effort to rewrite the Affordable Care Act without congressional approval – the 14th such move to date – administration insiders are starting to sweat.

Obama openly evaded a question about the politifact.com website's 'Lie of the year' award, which went to his guarantee that Americans who liked their health insurance policies could keep them.

'We're going to make mistakes and we're going to have problems,' Obama said without offering apologies for misleading Americans in the run-up to his 2012 re-election, 'but my intentions have been clear throughout, which is, I just want to help as many people as possible.'

On the healthcare.gov website's failings, though, he was more direct: 'Since I'm in charge, we screwed it up.'

Add the White House's health care woes to the most recent developments on the National Security Agency's controversial surveillance programs – a federal judge ruled them essentially unconstitutional on Monday – and a picture is emerging of a presidency in crisis during a time when most presidents have an easy go of things.

The fifth year of a two-term White House incumbent is usually more liberating than frustrating, and usually provides a president with a clean-slate chance to accomplish something significant before the realities of politics intrude in the form of perilous congressional elections.

'Conflation': Obama bristled at one reporter's complaint about Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's testimony that misled Congress about the NSA's spying. 'You're conflating, first of all, me and Mr. Clapper,' he said

But the tea party is angry, moderates in Congress are unsure what Obama is thinking, and liberals are increasingly disillusioned.

Obama took questions, saying first that White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 'had prepared a list of who's naughty and nice,'

'Has this been the worst year of your presidency?' came question #1.

Another focused on Iran's nuclear program, a problem so vexing that Democrat Bob Menendez is using his Senate committee chair to push for new sanctions if the Islamic nation breaks its word on a new round of international transparency.

'There is no need for new sanctions legislation, not yet,' Obama said, explaining that he still prefers a diplomatic route.

'It is very important to test whether that is possible. Not because it's guaranteed, but be cause the alternative is possibly us having to engage in some sort of conflict to resolve the problem – with all kinds of unintended consequences.

'It is my goal to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,' the president said, 'but I sure would rather do it diplomatically.'

Obama dodged most bullets, but was cornered on an early question about the National Security Agency spying scandal.

Asked how he now justified his administration's early assurances that the situation as well in-hand, the president bristled at the idea that Director of National Intelligence James Clapper's testimony – which is widely considered to have misled Congress – reflected the White House's positions.

'You're conflating, first of all, me and Mr. Clapper,' said Obama, before generally defending U.S. intelligence-gathering programs.

He cited the healthcare.gov rollout flop as his biggest mistake this year, but later expressed an interest in starting fresh after 'a couple days of sleep and sun' in Hawaii.

And asked what could lie ahead if Republicans leapt back into crisis mode by using the recent calm over budgets as a springboard for new negotiations over the federal debt ceiling, Obama winced.

'I've got to assume folks aren't crazy enough to start that all over again,' he said, warning against 'brinksmanship' and 'government by crisis' if conservatives move again to use the debt ceiling as 'leverage.'

On NSA snooping, Obama insisted that his administration 'is evaluating all the recommendations that were made,' in a recent task force report. 'I'll make a pretty definitive statement' in January, he promised. 'I'm taking this pretty seriously.'

The NSA, Obama said, had determined that it 'was pretty important to track' phone calls that come into the U.S. from known terrorists, and he defended the program by saying that 'in all the reviews of this program that have been done,' there was no evidence that the agency has used its power inappropriately.

'The question we are going to have to ask is can we accomplish the same goal' in another way,' and 'give the public more confidence' in its government.

'Just because we can do something doesn’t mean we necessarily should,' Obama said.

Asked to explain his choices of athletes to represent the U.S. at the Sochi Winter Olympics opening and closing ceremonies, the president said the roster 'speaks for itself.'

The inclusion of Brian Boitano and Billie Jean King, two openly gay sports heroes, is seen as a slap in the face to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose nation's parliament enacted a wide-ranging anti-gay law in June.

Tyou should take that for what it's worth,' Obama said. 'We don't make distinctions on the basis of sexual orientation. We judge people on how they perform.'
