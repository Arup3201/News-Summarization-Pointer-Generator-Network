British No1 Andy Murray was unsurprisingly in good form after his straight sets victory over John Isner on Sunday secured Great Britain's pathway into the Davis Cup quarter-finals.

Although, that wasn't too be good news for his Great Britain team-mate Dominic Inglot - as Murray unintentionally stitched the 29-year-old up in a post-match interview.

Speaking to Eurosport presenter Annabel Croft about how they would all celebrate the victory over the United States, Murray hinted that Inglot might spend the evening with a 'little girlfriend'.

Murray cheekily said: 'Dom's got a little girlfriend on the go,' before going on to laugh.

When Inglot was then asked immediately after who the girl was he replied somewhat embarrassingly: 'You've actually landed me in this. Because, I've actually got a girlfriend whose going to be watching this at home!'

Murray then erupted with laughter, before going over to comfort a clearly embarrassed and shell-shocked Inglot.

Earlier in the day Andy Murray secured a straight sets win over John Isner to send Great Britain into the Davis Cup quarter-finals - where they will face France

Sportsmail understands that the supporter infatuated by Inglot has been watching the matches over the weekend and her admiration for him was noted by the Great Britain team. 

Murray also wasn't aware that Inglot had a girlfriend. Inglot later took to Twitter, writing: 'Just to clarify, there is no girl on the side. The joke interview was just a joke. All banter with @andy_murray.'

The doubles player - whose partner in Glasgow was Andy's older brother Jamie - took to social media on Sunday night to confirm it was a joke by Murray, and that he doesn't have a girl on the side.
