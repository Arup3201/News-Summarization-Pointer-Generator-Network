Hillary Clinton won't be America's next president, says Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann, because many U.S. voters 'aren’t ready' for a female president and don't hunger to break new ground the way they did with Barack Obama

'I think there was a cachet about having an African-American president because of [civil rights] guilt,' the outspoken conservative told Tribune Media Services columnist Cal Thomas, in a piece that first ran February 18.

'People don’t hold guilt for a woman,' she said, and even as Americans elect women at every other level of government, 'I don't think there is a pent-up desire' to call someone 'Madam President.'

Obama, Bachmann adds, had the advantage 
of being 'new and different,' while Mrs. Clinton has been a fixture in 
U.S. politics since the early 1990s.

Rep. Michele Bachmann called off her presidential campaign on Jan. 4, 2012, perhaps coming away with the idea that her gender kept her from wowing the crowds the way her arch-enemy Barack Obama can

Last time around: Hillary Clinton ran once in 2008, losing a bitterly fought contest to the future president Barack Obama

'Based off her own personal experience, Rep. Bachmann found that voters weren’t simply interested in electing a president based on their gender,' Bachmann spokesman Dan Kotman told MailOnline, 'but were focused on finding a candidate based on their merits.'

'Isn’t that what the feminist movement is all about?'

Bachmann's months in a heated presidential primary battle during 2011 and 2012 ended quickly after 
details of her debilitating migraines emerged.

She was the sole 
female in a nine-person GOP field.

Hillary Clinton played that role on the Democratic side of the political ledger in 2008, and lasted far longer than the Bachmann would four years later.

The former U.S. senator and first lady won the New Hampshire Democratic Primary before fading in the end and losing the nomination to Barack Obama.

With Hillary on the far left and Michell on the far right, there's no love lost between the two.

If Clinton were to succeed her husband in the White House, Bachmann said, 'effectively she 
would be Obama's third and fourth term in office' since she was 'the godmother of Obamacare' in 1993.

But Hillary is beatable, she added

President Obama (L) benefited from white Americans' generations-long civil-rights 'guilt,' Bachmann told columnist Cal Thomas (R), adding that no such bonus points were available for females

'She has a real problem when it comes to Benghazi,' says Bachmann of the 2012 terror attack in Libya that unfolded during Mrs. Clinton's time as Secretary of State.

'She was in charge during the Benghazi debacle. If a person reads the Senate Intelligence report and the House Foreign Affairs report released [last] week, it is damning for Hillary Clinton,' the tea party darling told the columnist.

Bachmann herself isn't running for re-election.She's facing a cloud of ethics uncertainties stemming from payments her campaign-related organizations made to an Iowa state legislator while he was stumping for her in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses.

But Kotman said that Clinton's shortcomings will end her career without reaching America's political pinnacle.

'Tthe former Secretary of State has many glaring challenges to address,' he said.

Eght years later: Clinton, now 66, is a virtual lock for front-runner status when the Democrats' 2016 White House scrum begins
