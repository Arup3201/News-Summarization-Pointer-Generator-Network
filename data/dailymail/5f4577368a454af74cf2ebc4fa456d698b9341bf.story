Santi Cazorla believes Arsenal must follow the blueprint of Atletico Madrid if they are to end their 10-year Premier League trophy drought against their big spending title rivals.

Atletico were crowned La Liga champions for the first time since 1996 last season after breaking the dominance of Barcelona and city rivals Real.

Diego Simeone's side wrestled the title away from the El Clasico duo despite the loss of talisman Falcao to Monaco, while Real and Barcelona spent heavily on marquee signings Gareth Bale and Neymar respectively.

Speaking to Marca, Cazorla says Atletico's method of success should be something the Gunners should employ whilst trying to compete against the likes of Premier League winners Manchester City and Co.

'Atletico are good example to follow,' he said. 'Atletico and Arsenal have to play the same way, but everyone is looking to win titles.

'They had an incredible season last year, winning titles takes several campaigns, I admire everything they have conquered. Many people do not realise how hard it is to win a league competing with Barcelona or Madrid.'

Despite the signings of Alexis Sanchez, David Ospina, Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers this summer, the Spain international believes next season's Premier League is too close to call with all their title rivals strengthening as well this summer.

'Manchester City are the current champions and will always be the ones to watch out for,' he added.

'Manchester United are coming off the back of a bad season - but they will come back stronger this season. Having no European competition this season will focus their attention on the league.

'Then there's Chelsea, who have  made great signings: Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas, Courtois, who has returned... But it's difficult to choose one, the problem is that there are many.

'I do not want to forget other teams like Liverpool, who went so close to the title last year, or Tottenham. I'm sure it will be very open and just hope that Arsenal are in the top group.'
