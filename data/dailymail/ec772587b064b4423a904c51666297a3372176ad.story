Died in desperate battle to save ambassador: Agent Sean Smith

A month ago today, computer expert Sean Smith was killed in the U.S. compound in Benghazi alongside ambassador Chris Stevens.

In the weeks that followed, his grieving mother Pat met with many high-ranking officials, including President Obama, who promised her she would hear the truth about her son's death, however painful it might be.

But last night Pat Smith launched a scathing attack on the White House administration, saying she had been kept in the dark about what happened to her only child.

Speaking to Anderson Cooper on CNN last night, she told how she cried on Obama's shoulder and how: 'Everyone of them, all the big shots over there told me - they promised me, they promised me that they would tell me what happened.

'I told them, please don't give me any baloney that comes through with this political stuff.

'I don't want political stuff. You can keep your political, just tell me the truth - what happened.

'And I still don't know. In fact, today I just heard something more that he died of smoke inhalation.

'I look at TV and I see bloody hand prints on walls, thinking: 'My God, is that my son's? I don't know if he was shot. I don't know - I don't know.

'They haven't told me anything. They are still studying it. And the things that they are telling me are just outright lies.'

Tragedy: Pat Smith, whose son Sean was killed in the embassy attack a month ago, still does not know how he died

Mrs Smith was not the only mother frustrated at the distortion surrounding the events at the embassy on September 11.

Barbara, mother of Former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty, who was also killed in the attack, also asked Mitt Romney to stop invoking her 
son's name on the campaign trail.

She said: 'I don't trust Romney - he shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda.'

Mrs Smith did not wish to speak politics - but just wanted the truth.

Killed: Ambassador Chris Stevens died following smoke inhalation

She said: 'He was my only child. And he was good, he was good at what he did, he'd loved it.

'I begged them to tell me what happened.

'I said I want to know all the details, all of the details no matter what it is, and I'll make up my own mind on it.'

She continued: 'And everyone of them, all the big shots over there told me that - they promised me, they promised me that they would tell me what happened. As soon as they figured it out.

'No one, not one person has ever, ever gotten back to me other than media people and the gaming people [her son was an avid computer game player].

Asked who told her she would be contacted, she replied: 'Obama told me. Hillary promised me. Joe Biden - Joe Biden is a pleasure. He was a real sweetheart.

'But he also told - they all told me that - they promised me.

'And I told them please, tell me what happened. Just tell me what happened.

'I told them, please don't give me any baloney that comes through with this political stuff. I don't want political stuff.

'You can keep your political, just tell me the truth. What happened. And I still don't know. In fact, today I just heard something more that he died of smoke inhalation.

'I don't even know if that's true or not. No, I don't. I don't know where. I look at TV and I see bloody hand prints on walls, thinking, my God, is that my son's?

'I don't know if he was shot. I don't know -- I don't know. They haven't told me anything. They are still studying it. And the things that they are telling me are just outright lies.

'[Secretary of Defense] Leon Panetta actually took my face in his hands like this and he said: "Trust me. I will tell you what happened".

Promise of answers: Obama speaking in Columbus, Ohio, this week

She added: 'And so far, he's told me nothing. Nothing at all. And I want to know.

'I told him, if it's such a secret thing, fine, take me in another room, whisper in my ear what happened so that I know, and we'll go from there.

'But no. No, they - you know, they treat me like - at first I was so proud because they were treating me so nice when I went to that reception.

'They all came up to me and talked to me and everything. I cried on Obama's shoulder. And he - then he'd kind of look off into the distance.

'So that was worthless to me. I want to know, for God's sakes. Or for Allah's sake or whoever's sake is there.

'I told Obama personally, I said, look, I had him for his first 17 years and then he went into the service, then you got him.

'And - I won't say it the way I said it - but I said you screwed up, you didn't do a good job, I lost my son. And they said, we'll get back to you. We - I promise, I promise you. I will get back to you.

Cooper told Smith that the administration could at least keep her apprised of the investigation, and she agreed, saying: 'That would be so nice. That would at least acknowledge that I have a right to know something, something other than, we're checking up on it, or trust me.

'I like that one the best of all. Trust me. I will let you know.

'Well, I don't trust you anymore. I don't trust you anymore. You - I'm not going to say lied to me, but you didn't tell me and you knew.'

The State Department says it never concluded that the attack was simply a protest gone awry.

Meanwhile
 the investigating committee's chairman, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., 
has accused the State Department of turning aside pleas from its 
diplomats in Libya to increase security in the months and weeks before 
the attack.

One scheduled 
witness, Eric Nordstrom, the former chief security officer for U.S. 
diplomats in Libya, told the committee his pleas for more security were 
ignored.

Department 
officials were asked about the administration's initial - and since 
retracted - explanation linking the violence to protests over an 
American-made anti-Muslim video circulating on the Internet.

One official responded 'that was not our conclusion' and called it a question for 'others' to answer, without specifying to whom he was referring.

The burn-out wreckage following the fires within the U.S. Consulate

The
 officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't 
authorized to speak publicly on the matter, and provided no evidence 
that might suggest a case of spontaneous violence or angry protests that
 went too far.

Republican presidential candidate 
Mitt Romney and Republican lawmakers have increasingly sharpened their 
criticism of the administration's initial explanation of the attack.

They said they never accepted the original explanation. 

It
 was a top administration diplomatic official, United Nations Ambassador
 Susan Rice, who gave a series of interviews five days after the attack 
that wrongly described the attack as spontaneous. 

She
 said that the administration believed the violence was unplanned and 
that extremists with heavier weapons 'hijacked' the protest against the 
anti-Islamic video.

Governor Mitt Romney pointed the finger at Obama's administration for wrongly describing the attack as 'spontaneous'

She did
 qualify her remarks to say that was the best information she had at the
 time. Rice since has denied trying to mislead Congress. 

A
 concurrent CIA memo obtained by The Associated Press cited intelligence
 suggesting the demonstrations in Benghazi 'were spontaneously inspired 
by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo' and 'evolved into a direct
 assault' on the diplomatic posts by 'extremists'.

Nordstrom,
 the former security official in Libya, addressed the diplomatic 
security issue in an October 1 email to a congressional investigator.

He
 said his requests for more security were blocked by a department policy
 to 'normalise operations and reduce security resources'.

A
 memo on Tuesday by the Oversight Committee's Democratic staff provided 
details of Nordstrom's interview with the panel's investigators.

In
 that interview, Nordstrom said he sent two cables to State Department 
headquarters in March 2012 and July 2012 requesting additional 
diplomatic security agents for Benghazi, but he received no responses. 

He
 stated that Charlene Lamb, the deputy assistant secretary for 
international programs, wanted to keep the number of U.S. security 
personnel in Benghazi artificially low.

He
 said Lamb believed the Benghazi facilities did not need any diplomatic 
security special agents because there was a residential safe haven to 
fall back to in an emergency. 

Nordstrom's
 October 1 memo to the congressional investigator said: 'You will note 
that there were a number of incidents that targeted diplomatic missions 
and underscored the GoL's (government of Libya) inability to secure and 
protect diplomatic missions.

'This
 was a significant part of (the diplomatic) post's and my argument for 
maintaining continued DS (diplomatic security) and DOD (Department of 
Defense) security assets into Sept/Oct. 2012 - the GoL was overwhelmed 
and could not guarantee our protection.

'Sadly, that point was reaffirmed on Sept. 11, 2012, in Benghazi.'
