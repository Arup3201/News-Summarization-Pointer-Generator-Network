Dixie Dean, Duncan Ferguson, Bob Latchford, Graeme Sharp, Joe Royle - all previous Everton No 9s, owners of the most iconic shirt in the Blues’ history.

Ever since the days of Dean, the famous jersey has always belonged to Everton’s main man in the box, the predator in front of goal and, certainly in Big Dunc’s case, the marksman who could ruffle a few of the opponents’ feathers. The shirt has always held a special meaning at Goodison Park.

However the current incumbent of Everton’s most sought-after shirt is yet to make anywhere near the same impact as his much-loved predecessors. 

Everton striker Arouna Kone made an eagerly-awaited return from injury in the Europa League

Arouna Kone - through no fault of his own it must be said - has had a nightmare 18 months at Everton following his £6million arrival from Wigan in the summer of 2013.

The Ivorian arrived on Merseyside with former Latics boss Roberto Martinez as the man to spearhead the Spaniard’s blue revolution.

However, after a less than convincing start to life at Everton – which included fluffing relatively easy chances at home to Hull and against Stevenage in the League Cup - the striker was injured, ending his debut season prematurely.

Now, having returned to fitness, Kone was desperate to open his Everton account having watched his team-mates struggle for form this term after last season’s impressive fifth-placed finish.

The 31-year-old argues with referee Istvan Kovacs after receiving a caution 

‘If I did manage to score it would be fantastic,’ said Kone on Wednesday. ‘It would represent the beginning of a big comeback. I’ve got such a huge passion to get my first goal for Everton. It would be marvellous.’

Taking to the field as the lone frontman, Kone, distinctive with his bright white hair, strutted around the pitch before kick-off like Everton No 9s of old.

Clearly confident and raring to go, the former PSV forward made an encouraging start. On ten minutes the Ivorian barged his opponent off the ball and cut inside with pace before running into a cul-de-sac. Dispossessed but showing the intent up front the Goodison faithful expect from their strikers.

Five minutes later and his dream comeback looked on. Finding space from 20 yards out, the play opened up for Kone who, sensing an opportunity to score his first goal in the blue of Everton, took aim and unleashed a powerful effort as Krasnodar keeper Andrei Sinitsin made a smart save to his right.

Buoyed by the crowds reactions to his efforts, Kone then attempted an overhead kick – it may have gone away from goal but supporters appreciated his audaciousness. The striker seemed to be revelling at being back on the pitch in a competitive game.

The second half saw a much quieter Kone but showing a glimpse of skill to work his way into the box after jinking past a helpless defender certainly got the crowd on their feet.

Having doubted his capabilities following his first few months at the club, Kone may have changed fan opinion based on Thursday’s showing.

The striker cut short his summer holidays and stayed at Finch Farm in a bid to improve his fitness and seems determined to make his mark at Goodison Park and did his case no harm in this dead-rubber despite failing to find a goal.

After an encouraging performance, should Kone can stay fit, Everton, who also boast Samuel Eto’o and Romelu Lukaku among their striking ranks, may just have a trio of attackers as good as any other in this season’s Europa League.

There is still much, much more to do to become the next great Everton No 9 but the desire and intent is there from Kone.
