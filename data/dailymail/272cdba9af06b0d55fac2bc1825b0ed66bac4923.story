The banker flew to a luxury resort island in Indonesia thinking he was about to be interviewed for a lucrative job connected with multimillionaire mining magnate and political leader Clive Palmer.

Instead, the alleged perpetrators of an elaborate plot used the bogus interview to try to get the National Australia Bank executive to say he lied during a court case in which one of the suspects was suing the bank.

When that failed, they sent two Indonesians dressed as security officers to take the banker captive - seizing his passport, mobile phone and wallet - until he made a videotaped confession regardin gthe case, police allege.

Palmer United Party media adviser Andrew Crook, 48, of New Farm in Brisbane, appeared before the Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday charged with retaliation of a witness, attempting to pervert the course of justice, and attempted fraud.

Former police detective Mick Featherstone, 51, of the Gold Coast, also appeared on identical charges. 

Police said an arrest warrant had been issued for a third man wanted in the, former Australian Rules Footballer and property developer Tony Smith, who lives overseas.

The court was told there were allegedly emails between Crook, Featherstone and Smith, involved in luring the NAB employee to an Indonesian Island with a fake job opportunity.

Barefooted and wearing a shirt and shorts, Crook sat in the dock with his arms folded across his chest. He kept his gaze focused on the magistrate, avoiding any glances in a public gallery full of journalists.

His lawyer argued that Crook had no prior convictions and was not a flight risk having owned a business for the past 20 years in Brisbane.

Crook was granted bail with conditions, including that he does not contact any of the co-accused, the witnesses, NAB employee and that he surrender his passport.

Featherstone was also granted bail under similar conditions.

Both men are not to approach within 100 metres of two Southport NAB branches, despite Featherstone's lawyer saying his client banks with NAB.

Mr Smith, 48, is currently in Indonesia. 

Police will allege the three men lured a NAB executive to Batam Island in Indonesia under the false assumption that he was to be interviewed for a high paying job as a global finance manager with a company owned by Mr Palmer.

Detective Superintendent Mick Niland said police will allege Featherstone used a false identity and Crook used his media company links 'to make the job offer appear as the real deal'.

'We will allege to real reason was to extract a confession from the bank employee and make him retract and change his evidence, which he gave during a civil trial in 2012 in the Supreme Court in Queensland,' Mr Niland said.

Since 2009 Mr Smith has been involved in civil legal action against  NAB, claiming he lost $70 million after an agreement with the bank and broken contracts caused a finance company he owned to collapse.

Detective Inspector Phillip Stevens said police will allege the three me 'schemed' to elicit a confession from the NAB employee, who was a key witness in the civil matter.

‘It will be alleged that part of that planning occurred in Queensland, the execution of key parts of that plan were done in Singapore and Indonesia, and then the offences were committed back in Queensland,’ Mr Stevens said.  

Mr Stevens said: ‘It reads like a Hollywood script.’

Mr Niland described the alleged plan as 'bizarre'.

He added that Mr Palmer was not involved in the investigation.

‘He is a victim of the circumstances, where his name has been used by the three offenders in an effort to lure the NAB executive to the island in Indonesia,’ he said.

Queensland police said in a statement that the attempt to get the banker to admit that he had lied during the court case failed. Events then took an even more bizarre turn.

Police allege two Indonesians dressed in security uniforms entered the room where the interview took place an detained the banker, seizing his mobile phone, wallet and passport.

The man was then threatened 'which ultimately led to him being coerced into make a confessional video before they would allow him to leave the island,' the police statement said.

Earlier on Friday Mr Crook was arrested after police raided his New Farm home in inner Brisbane , before going to his offices in the CBD for further raids, the ABC reported.

Police also arrested former police detective Mick Featherstone on the Gold Coast.

Police Taskforce Maxima also issued an arrest warrant for former Sydney Swans player and property developer Tony Smith, who is believed to be overseas.

Police said Taskforce Maxima's Criminal Economy Team - set up to eliminate bikie gangs -uncovered evidence  while it was investigating another matter. 

The ABC's 7.30 Report conducted an investigation in Mr Featherstone, which aired in September, and it encouraged the alleged victim to come forward to police with his story.

On Friday, Mr Palmer suggested the arrests were an attempt to undermine him in the lead-up to the Queensland election.

'It's a significant thing to me that it's state police up  there [raiding Mr Crook's office] and [Premier] Campbell Newman is going to call the election probably in February or March,' he told the ABC.

'A lot of these things are being orchestrated to happen at this time.

'I think it's an effort to undermine our political support in Queensland and try to get Campbell Newman re-elected as Premier.'

Mr Palmer said he was concerned that his election campaign materials were seized during the raids conducted on Mr Crook's office.

'From my point of view I'd be concerned - police issued a search warrant where they can get access and take away all of his computers and that would contain all of our election plans for the coming state election,' he told 2GB. 

Mr Niland rejected this idea.

‘It’s utter nonsense to say it’s political or somehow politics is involved,’ he said.

He added that Mr Palmer’s campaign materials were ‘extremely safe’ in police custody and will be returned to him as soon as possible. 

National Australia Bank today confirmed it provided Queensland Police with details of allegedly 'unsolicited approaches' made to an employee in regards to evidence they gave in a civil court trial involving a former customer.

'This has been a difficult time for our employee,' a spokesman said in a statement.

'These are serious matters that should now be investigated and dealt with by Queensland Police and any other relevant authority.'
