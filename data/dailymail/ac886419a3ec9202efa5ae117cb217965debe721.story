CCTV: This 13-year-old teenager slapped a 52-year-old female fishmonger around the face with a sea bream

A 13-year-old girl who slapped a fishmonger in the face with a large sea bream has been let go by police after she apologised.

The teenager was captured smiling on CCTV moments before the bizarre fish-slapping incident at an Asda store in Accrington, Lancashire, in February.

Police officers released the the camera footage in the hopes of tracing the person responsible and the attacker has now been identified as a 13-year-old girl.

But Lancashire Police today admitted the girl has been let go with a slap on the wrist after she wrote a letter of apology to the 52-year-old staff member.

In a statement Lancashire police said: 'Following the appeal that we released, a 13-year-old girl has been spoken to by officers and has taken part in a community resolution whereby she has sent the victim a letter of apology.

'The matter has therefore been resolved and is now closed. There will be no more police involvement.'

The 52-year-old victim was working on the Asda fish counter when the teenager approached her stall and asked about what was for sale.

Without warning, the girl suddenly picked up a bream which was on ice and slapped the shocked worker with it before running out of the store.

The victim believes the incident was being filmed on a mobile phone by a man stood nearby who also ran from the scene when challenged.

The attacker was initially described as being Irish and aged between 15 and 18 with blonde, shoulder-length untidy hair.

Police described the prank as 'completely unacceptable'.

The incident is an odd echo of 
sketches by Monty Python's Flying Circus - one of which featured a man 
in military uniform dancing on a canal towpath while slapping another 
man with a fish.

His fun 
is brought to an abrupt halt when the second man pulls out an enormous 
specimen and uses it to hit his aggressor around the head, knocking him 
into the water.

The incident also has more serious echoes of 'happy slapping', a craze which took hold for a few years in the early 2000s when mobile phones were first equipped with video cameras.

Mostly performed by teenagers, the pranks involved slapping or hitting someone while being filmed and then uploading the footage to the internet.

Some took the prank too far and in 2008 a 15-year-old girl, who was too young to be named, was sentenced to a two-year detention and training order after filming an attack on 29-year-old victim Gavin Waterhouse, who later died.

No laughing matter: The incident is reminiscent of the fish slapping dance in a sketch by Monty Python
