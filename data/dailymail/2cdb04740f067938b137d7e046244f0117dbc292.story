A young festival goer died from inhaling a single drop of a new synthetic hallucinogenic drug called 25-I at a music festival.

Clayton Otwell, from Arkansas, took the small but fatal dosage from a stranger on Saturday night at New Orlean’s Voodoo Experience and went into convulsions 30 minutes later.

The 21-year-old with dreadlocked hair was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was placed on life support, but died on Tuesday.

Tragic: Clayton Otwell (pictured), 21, from Arkansas died after inhaling a single drop of hallucinogenic drug 25-I at the Voodoo Experience festival in New Orleans.

Otwell's mother, Dayna Duncan, said she hopes justice will be served to the person who gave him the fatal drop.

'I think he needs to be exposed and held accountable for his actions,' she told the Times-Picayune.

New Orleans Police Department told the Daily Mail that Otwell’s death is an active investigation and there are no arrests and no suspects at this time.

Otwell and a close friend had made a pact never to take drugs from strangers, but Otwell broke that promise after drinking several vodka-Red Bulls, said the friend who was with him at the time.

Otwell was among three known people treated for 25-I overdoses during Voodoo Experience weekend, one local emergency room doctor said.

Friends of all three patients believed that it was their first times taking the experimental drug.

A Drug Enforcement Administration agent, Bob Bell, said that 25-I is an extremely potent synthetic substance that the DEA considers comparable to LSD and therefore outlawed in all 50 states.

The drug is also referred to as 'N-Bomb' for its chemical composition 25I-NBOMe.

New and experimental drugs like 25-I have grown in popularity in recent years partly due to the misconception that they are safe and legal.

Two teenagers in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and a 16-year-old boy in Sacramento, California, are believed to have died from 25-I overdoses earlier this year, according to DEA officials.

Otwell's friends said dealers at Voodoo Experience had been giving out drops of 25-I throughout the weekend-long festival, promoting the drug as artificial acid and artificial mescaline.

Voodoo Experience is known for its mixture of local Louisiana performers and high-profile artists, including R.E.M., Eminem, Jack White and Red Hot Chili Peppers. It was first held on Halloween Weekend 1999.

In 2007 the festival expanded to three days and broke all previous attendance records with an estimated 100,000 plus fans.

A friend of Otwell’s created an online memorial fund to help raise money for his grieving family.

Levi Gould, who created the page, wrote: 'Clayton was an amazing son, brother, and friend. His memory will never be forgotten as he will live in our hearts forever.

'He shined his light on so many people and had such a positive influence on anyone he came into contact with. Lets all help to provide support to his family during this tragic time.'
