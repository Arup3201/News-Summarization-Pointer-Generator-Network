The Boston bombing survivor who had her leg amputated on Monday has spoken out about her excitement at starting a new life - as she vowed to run the marathon one day.

Rebekah DiMartino, 27, had her left leg amputated below the knee at a hospital near Houston, Texas on Monday after doctors struggled for 18 months to save it.

But after undergoing 17 operations and suffering debilitating pain since the April 2013 bombings, having the leg amputated was an easy decision for DiMartino to make.

'I have said all along that my leg is just my leg and my life is so much more,' she told the Today show on Wednesday.

Speaking out: Rebekah DiMartino, 27, told the Today show how excited she is about her recovery following her leg amputation on Monday. She was seriously injured in the Boston Marathon bombing last year

'I am thrilled because I am moving on with my life. I am taking away the old and bringing in the new and I just can't wait to see what it brings.'

Part of that future will include running the Boston Marathon, she said.

'It's one of my biggest goals,' she said. 'I will run the Boston Marathon, definitely.'

Before she lost the limb on Monday, DiMartino tickled her supporters by posting a break-up letter to the leg on Facebook, hosting a 'left leg last supper' and writing, 'It's not you, it's me' across her shin. 

Recovering: After the surgery, DiMartino posed with her son for a selfie and shared an image of her leg

'I've had a lot of fun with it,' she told the Today show. 'Everybody looks at it as such a sad thing, but it's really not, it's my new beginning... I feel better than I have in 18 months.'

She will now beginning physical therapy and will eventually be fitted for a prosthetic. 

Her husband Pete, who was at the marathon with DiMartino and her seven-year-old son Noah, said that he has no doubt that his wife with master the new limb.

'She is very stubborn, which is not really a bad thing because she will be told she can't do something and she just tries to do it anyway,' he told KHOU.

She told the channel she is also determine to recover so that the brothers who inflicted horror and pain on the city of Boston last year do not win.   

Injuries: Ahead of the surgery, she shared this image, left, showing her saying goodbye to the leg. Since the bombing, she has undergone 17 operations, including having pins put in her leg, right

Saying goodbye: She posted this farewell note to her left leg on her Facebook page on Sunday

DiMartino was with her son and Pete, who was then just her boyfriend, at the finish line of the Boston Marathon in April 2013 when the two bombs detonated, killing three people and injuring 270. 

All three were wounded in the blast but Rebekah suffered the most extensive damage to her left leg.

In a bid to save the limb, she underwent 17 operations, including putting metal plates, screws and rods in her leg, but she also suffered a serious bone infection. 

Although she was confined to bedrest or a wheelchair for much of the time after the bombings, she was able to walk down the aisle on crutches when she married Pete last year.

Still, even a boot did not helped her gain strength or ease the pain in the leg, and before the operation, she said that finally losing it will be 'such a relief'.

Excitement: She said that her seven-year-old son Noah, pictured, is excited to have a 'part robot mom'

'There is not an ounce of sadness anywhere in my heart,' she wrote on Facebook after the operation on Monday. 'What has been anticipated and stressed about since April 2013 is over and I am moving on to the next chapter.' 

After the successful operation, she also shared a selfie of her grinning beside her son Noah.

Before the operation, she said that the seven-year-old boy had long been upset about her potentially losing her leg, but last week, after asking her a lot of questions about her operation, that changed.

She explained: 'With the biggest smile on his face he shouted 'that's so cool! I'm gonna have a part robot mom!''
