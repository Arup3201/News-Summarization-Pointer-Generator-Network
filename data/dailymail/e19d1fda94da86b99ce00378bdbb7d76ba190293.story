Americans are exercising more than ever, but it isn't having the desired impact on reducing waistlines as poor diet is blamed for the nation's growing obesity crisis.

Greater numbers of men and women became more physically active between 2001 and 2009, according to data published Wednesday by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.

The number of women getting sufficient weekly exercise increased from 46.7% to 51.3%, while for men the figure increased by a single point to 57.8%.

New research has found that people are exercising more than ever, but it isn't having the desired impact on reducing waistlines

Yet over the same time period obesity rates for men or women fell in just nine counties.

‘There has been a lot of progress on physical activity,’ said Dr. Christopher Murray, lead author of the research, which was published in the journal Population Health Metrics. 

‘To tackle obesity, we need to do this. But we probably also need to do more. … Just counting on physical activity is not going to be the solution.’

More than one-third of U.S. adults and approximately 17% of children are obese, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Poor diet has been identified as the number one factor contributing to America's poor health compared to other industrialized nations

Many health experts believe that changing diet may do more to bring those numbers down than increasing exercise.

A separate paper by the institute published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association identified poor diet as the number one factor contributing to America’s poor health compared to other industrialized nations.

It compared 20 years of health data from a vast number of surveys, published studies and death certificates in the United States with similar records in 34 high-income countries in Europe, Asia and North America.

Overall, the United States fell in the rankings between 1990 and 2010 on nearly every major health measure.

‘Despite a level of health expenditures 
that would have seemed unthinkable a generation ago, the health of the 
U.S. population has improved only gradually and has fallen behind the 
pace of progress in many other wealthy nations,’ wrote Dr. Harvey 
Fineberg of the Institute of Medicine in Washington, D.C.

These new health papers have been released simultaneously at the request of first lady Michelle Obama, who plans to present the findings to mayors of U.S. cities in an invitation-only event at the White House as part of her campaign to improve the nation's health.

In a 2010 report by the nonprofit Commonwealth Fund, the United States, despite spending twice as much on healthcare, came in dead last compared with six peers - Britain, Canada, Germany, Netherlands, Australia and New Zealand.

Life expectancy rates in the U.S. stagnated for women in 1,405 counties and for men in 154 counties over the period 1985-2010, researchers found.

Americans living in the 
worst-performing counties in the nation - in Appalachia - now live 
shorter lives than people in Vietnam, Yemen and Sudan.

Some
of the biggest gains in physical activity over the last decade have 
occurred in America’s unhealthiest counties in the Deep South.

Counties in Kentucky, Georgia and Florida all reported major increases in the number of people getting sufficient physical activity, which researchers defined as 150 total minutes of moderate activity or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per week.

The most active counties were concentrated in the Northeast, Upper Midwest and West, were about three quarters of residents were found to get enough exercise.

‘Understanding local trends in obesity and physical activity in both rural and urban areas will help communities develop successful strategies and learn from one another,’ said Dr. Ali Mokdad of the University of Washington, who worked on both of the studies.
