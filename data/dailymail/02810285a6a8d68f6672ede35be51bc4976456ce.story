A bitter Cabinet battle over which ministers face a fresh round of deep spending cuts has turned into the ‘something from the Hunger Games’, government insiders claimed.

The ring-fenced health and international aid budgets are being targeted by angry ministers in charge of unprotected departments told to find and extra £11.5billion.

Across Whitehall ministries are trying to off-load some of their costs by reclassifying into areas with rising budgets in a political ‘battle to the death’.

Government insiders have likened the Cabinet battle to the Hunger Games book and film, in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death

Insiders said a ‘battle to the death’ reminiscent of the film the Hunger Games has erupted in Whitehall, as ministers try to off-load some of their costs by reclassifying them into areas with rising budgets.

It is a reference to the futuristic sci-fi book and film, starring Jennifer Lawrence, in which 24 people are pitched into a battle to the death.

David Cameron today signalled that some defence spending could be shifted into the foreign aid budget to ease financial pressures on the armed forces.

Food, health and education programmes could also be moved into the Department for International Development, the Prime Minister hinted.

He said it was ‘right to ask the question about what does development actually consist of’.

He told BBC Radio 4: ‘Of course there are vaccination programmes, there’s helping the poorest people in our world to grow food programmes, there’s helping people go to school programmes.

‘But there is an argument that one of the most fundamental parts of development is security; you don’t get development without peace and security.’

David Cameron hinted that spending from some unprotected areas could be shifted into the protected foreign aid budget

Mr Cameron yesterday admonished Defence Secretary Philip Hammond for leaking details of MoD plans to grab £200 million from the Department of Health and another £120 million from the school’s budget to pay for private schooling for the children of servicemen.

At a Tory political cabinet yesterday morning, the Prime Minister called on ministers to ‘keep their thoughts to themselves’.

The future of the NHS budget has now become a bitter battleground. The Ministry of Justice and Home Office both want to breach the NHS ring fence too. And the Mail revealed last week that NHS funds could be funnelled to councils to fund personal care.

Deputy PM Nick Clegg defended protecting NHS spending

‘It’s every man for himself now,’ said one ministerial aide. ‘It’s a battle to the death, like something from the Hunger Games.’

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt is refusing to accept any cuts to his budget. He will remind the Prime Minister that ringfencing the NHS budget was his personal pledge to voters and argue that great harm will come to the Tory brand if he backtracks.

‘We will be arguing for the retention of the ringfence,’ a DoH source said. ‘This was a pledge the Prime Minister made in opposition. It was a big call to make and it has proved to be right.

‘Demand is rising by 4 per cent a year in the NHS and having the budget means we can just about meet the requirements and plan ahead. There is a very strong case for maintaining the ringfence. It would undo much of the good work of the original pledge.’

He seems to have an ally in Mr Clegg, who defended the controversial decision to protect spending on foreign aid and the NHS.

‘We’ve decided we’re sticking with the protected departments,’ he said. ‘Now the unprotected departments are being weighed up to see what savings they can yield.

‘I am absolutely convinced that at a difficult time like this protecting our NHS spending, protecting our spending on schools, honouring our international contributions to developing countries around the world was a big decision, a controversial decision but was the right one to take.’

The Department of Education is also resisting the raid on its funds by Mr Hammond. Education Secretary Michael Gove will argue that deep cuts to his budget will threaten the government’s pledge to provide free childcare to 40 per cent of 2 year olds and mean cuts to school sport.

One insider even said that if the Ministry of Defence wants money to send service children to private schools, Mr Gove should have some say over where they are stationed. ‘They don’t have to be posted to Germany,’ one irritated source said. ‘Perhaps Michael should be consulted about their deployments.’

The Mail has also learned that both the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office hope to seize funds from the department for International Development – plans Mr Cameron has previously endorsed.

Foreign Office insiders say that further cuts will damage the British Council and lead to the closure of historic embassy buildings around the world.
