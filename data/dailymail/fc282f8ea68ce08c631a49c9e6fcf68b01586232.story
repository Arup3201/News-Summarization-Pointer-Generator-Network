President Obama proved that he hasn't lost his cool edge on Sunday as he advised a young rapper to 'drop the mic' following his impressive performance.

The president stopped on Sunday at a
health center in Cape Town overseen by Archbishop Desmond Tutu, a visit aimed at 
highlighting the impact of a U.S.-funded program to stop the spread of 
HIV and AIDS.

Obama asked several of the students at the center about projects they were working on including 15-year-old Aviwe Mtongana, known as 'Katmeister', who told the President that he was a rapper.

Obama asked him to perform something causing the talented teenager to break into his song called Hell On Earth, according to ABC.

The boy rapped: 'Hell you earth, what people gonna do… on 
TV, you watching Scooby Doo… saying the punch line, he’s not cool.

'Now you face the hardest living… Getting 
out there is not pimping… The real way is through rapping.'

Obama praised the boy, saying that his song was fantastic before adding: 'You gotta drop the mic' and gesturing how to do so. 

Obama
praised Tutu's work at the center during an emotional meeting in which Tutu said Africans
are praying that Obama will be a success and a leader for peace, 
particularly in the Middle East.

Many of their aides were brought to 
tears as the two men embraced in a hug.

The president also addressed the 
University of Cape Town on Sunday, capping off an emotionally charged 
day in the picturesque coastal city, including a solemn visit to the 
Robben Island prison where Nelson Mandela was confined for 18 of his 27 
years in captivity.

Obama
stood stoically with his family in Mandela's cramped cell and peered 
across the lime quarry where Mandela toiled each day, causing the damage
to his lungs that led to his latest hospital stint.

He was flanked by a diverse array of 
students, underscoring Mandela's vision for a unified 'rainbow nation' 
for the country once led by a white racist government.

'Nelson Mandela showed us that one man's courage can move the world,' Obama said during his evening speech at the university.

Challenging African youth 
to seize a 'moment of great promise', Obama declared that the future of 
the young and growing continent still rests in ailing South African 
leader Mandela's vision for equality and opportunity.

Seeking
to carve out his own piece of that legacy, Obama unveiled an ambitious 
initiative to double electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa, vowing to
bring 'light where there is darkness'.

In the flagship address of his weeklong trip to Africa, Obama outlined a U.S. policy toward the continent that focuses on increasing the region's ability to support itself economically, politically and militarily.

Harkening back to a prominent theme from his 2009 speech in Ghana - Obama's only other trip to Africa as president - he said Africans must take much of the responsibility for achieving that goal, although he pledged American assistance.

'Ultimately I believe Africans should make up their own minds about what serves African interests,' he said.

'We trust your judgment, the judgment of ordinary people. We believe that when you control your destiny, if you got a handle on your governments, then governments will promote freedom and opportunity, because that will serve you.'

Obama's address came nearly 50 years after Robert F. Kennedy delivered his famous speech at the same university. Kennedy's speech, delivered soon after Mandela was sentenced to life in prison, called on young people to launch a fight against injustice, creating ripples of hope that would 'build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance'.

Much has changed in South Africa since Kennedy addressed the nation. The apartheid regime crumbled under intense internal and external pressure. Mandela was elected as his country's first black president following his release from prison. And South Africa has rapidly become continent's economic and political powerhouse.

But Obama said that progress, in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent, rests on a 'fragile foundation'.

In order to solidify the gains, Obama called on Africans to focus on three priorities: expanding opportunity, promoting democracy and supporting peace.

A cornerstone of Obama's efforts to expand opportunity is the new Power Africa initiative unveiled ahead of his speech. The venture is supported by $7 billion in U.S. investment and $9 billion from the private sector, and will seek to bring electricity to at least 20 million new households and commercial entities in an initial set of six countries: Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Nigeria and Tanzania.

The White House did not set a specific deadline for achieving that goal, but Obama advisers said it could happen within a decade. However, the first round of contributions still fall well short of the $300 billion the International Energy Agency says would be required to achieve universal electricity access in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030.

Obama opened his speech with deeply personal remarks about Mandela, tracing the anti-apartheid icon's influence on his own political activism to his young daughters. He said that standing in Mandela's cell alongside Malia and Sasha made the experience all the more poignant, reflecting on the distinction he shares with Mandela in being his country's first black president.

'Seeing them stand within the walls that once surrounded Nelson Mandela, I knew this was an experience they would never forget,' he said.

'I knew they now appreciated a little bit more that Madiba and other had made for freedom,' Obama added, referring to Mandela by his clan name.

Obama arrived in Cape Town on Sunday from Johannesburg, where he met privately with members of Mandela's family and spoke with the former president's wife. In keeping with the family's wishes, Obama did not visit Mandela in the hospital.

On a sunny winter day in the Southern Hemisphere, Obama and his family flew by helicopter to Robben Island, the prison that epitomized the struggle of Mandela and his contemporaries against apartheid rule.

The Obamas were led through the island by Ahmed Kathrada, an 83-year-old former prisoner who was held alongside Mandela and had also given Obama a tour of the jail when he visited as a U.S. senator in 2006.

The Obamas solemnly peered across the bright white lime quarry where Mandela worked each day. They spent 20 minutes inside the tiny cell where Mandela spent nearly two decades of his life, all the while inspiring the anti-apartheid movement on mainland South Africa.

Before closing their visit, Obama and wife Michelle stoically entered a prison courtyard, the president's hand on the small of the first lady's back, to sign a guestbook.

'On behalf of our family we're deeply humbled to stand where men of such courage faced down injustice and refused to yield,' Obama wrote.

'The world is grateful for the heroes of Robben Island, who remind us that no shackles or cells can match the strength of the human spirit.'
