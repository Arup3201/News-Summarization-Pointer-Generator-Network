The first woman to have her own seat on the New York Stock Exchange, left a large chunk of her will to her pet chihuahua.

Muriel 'Mickie' Siebert passed away August 24 at the age of 84 and designated $100,000 in her will towards taking care of her dog, Monster Girl.

Ms Siebert was a pioneer on Wall Street, buying her seat on the New York Stock Exchange in 1967 for $445,000.

Hairy heir: Muriel Siebert gave $100,000 in her will to Monster Girl, her pet chihuahua

First female: Muriel Siebert was the first woman to get elected to the New York Stock Exchange - a feat she accomplished in 1967

Monster Girl will now be taken care of by Ms Siebert's friend Lynda Fox-Frazer.

'I request that my dog not be left alone for long period of time during the day,' she wrote in the will, which was filed in Manhattan Surrogate's Court today.

Ms Siebert never married or had children of her own. Her only surviving family member is her sister Elaine Siebert, whom she gifted $1.5million in a trust.

Animal welfare was a cause close to Ms Siebert's heart and so she also designated $10,000 to go to The Animal Medical Center in Manhattan. She says that money must be gifted while Monster Girl is still living.

Most of Siebert's estate goes towards her foundation which 'supports the furtherance of education in personal financial literacy and the humane support of animals.'

Her foundation focuses on supporting animals 'owned by the elderly who are financially challenged'.

What she left behind: Muriel Siebert passed away on August 24 at the age of 84. Details of her will were released today

Ms Siebert was also generous with her friends. She left one friend, George Jones, $360,000.

Six
 of her girlfriends were allowed to choose three items from her jewelry 
collection, but they have to agree on how to split it.

If not, then her estate's executors will make the final decision.

Trailblazer: Ms Siebert at work in 2001, when she was head of stock trading firm Siebert Financial Corporation, which she started

Ms Siebert was born in Cleveland on September 12, 1928, the daughter of dentist Irwin Siebert, and his wife Margaret.

Generous sister: Ms Siebert was survived by her sister Elaine. She left Elaine with a $1.5million trust

She attended Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve) but left after two years when her father became sick.

In 1954 she moved to New York with just '$500, a Studebacker and a dream.'

She worked as a security analyst until she  decided to purchase her own seat on the New York Stock Exchange.

The first nine men she asked to sponsor her application declined and the tenth agreed.

The exchange said that if she was admitted it would cost her $445,000 and that a bank would need to lend her $300,000 - an amount the exchange had never asked an applicant before.

Two years later she secured a loan from Chase Manhattan and on December 28, 1967 was elected as the first female member on the exchange.

It was a groundbreaking moment for women on Wall Street, but for 10 years she would continue to be the only one of her sex at the NYSE. 

During her time there, she promoted 
the rights of women - eventually getting a women's restroom installed on
 the seventh floor near her favorite luncheon club.

She threatened that if the restroom was not installed by the end of the year, she would have a  porta-potty installed.

In
 recent years, Ms Siebert has been celebrated for her championship of 
gender equality on Wall Street, but she constantly warned that the women
 had a long way to go.

Glass ceiling shattered: Ms Siebert was the first woman on the NYSE, but it took 10 years for more women to join her. She was constantly warning about how women weren't fully equal in the boy's club of finance

'Firms are doing what they have to do, legally,' she said at a 1992 luncheon in her honor. 'But women are not coming into Wall Street in large numbers, and they are still not making partner and are not getting into the positions that lead to the executive suites. There's an old-boy network. you just have to keep fighting.'

In addition to her life at the NYSE, Ms Sierbet served as Superintendent of Banks for the State of New York.

When she found out that then-Governor Hugh Carey had appointed her to the position, she remembered thinking 'Mickie, you know you're a college dropout. You've done pretty well as a college dropout.'
