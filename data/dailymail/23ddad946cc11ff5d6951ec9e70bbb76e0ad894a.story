A 13-year-old boy with special needs was allegedly raped by an older male pupil at a Los Angeles middle school named after President Barack Obama.

The seventh-grade pupil, who has the mental capacity of a six to eight-year-old, is said to have been attacked by another boy in the gym at Barack Obama Global Preparation Academy when a physical education teacher left the 13-year-old unsupervised.

The boy's parents are planning to sue the Los Angeles Unified School District for child endangerment, their attorney said.

'Assault': The 13-year-old boy was allegedly raped by a classmate at the Los Angeles prep school when his physical education teacher left the pupils unattended

Attorney Brian Claypool told a press conference the teacher had left the alleged victim unsupervised during class, according to a report in the Daily Caller.

Investigation: The middle school in Los Angeles is named after U.S. President Barack Obama

The alleged assailant, who is in the eighth grade, is accused of luring the 13-year-old behind a set of bleachers at the gym and sexually assaulting him.

The Los Angeles Police Department is investigating the incident.

The boy's mother said she filed a complaint around two months ago because she was concerned her son was being bullied during gym class. School officials did nothing in response, she claims.

Mr Claypool said at the press conference that somebody should have been monitoring the alleged assailant.

'How was he wandering throughout the school, running around, recruiting another boy to have sex with him behind a bleacher?' he said.

'Does anybody at LAUSD care where the kids are during a class?'

The alleged victim's mother told reporters on Monday: 'Somebody, that particular day, dropped the ball.

'You can tell he's ashamed,' she said.

The boy's father added: 'This should never take place - not just to my son, any kid.'

The school district said in a statement: 'Allegations of student-on-student misconduct are taken seriously. Upon learning of the allegations, the school site acted to appropriately document and notify authorities of the suspected abuse.

'Although we cannot comment on the specific allegations or any potential lawsuit in this case, we are committed to ensuring student safety at all times.'
