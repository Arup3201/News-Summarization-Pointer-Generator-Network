A windowless room awaits Louis van Gaal on Sunday. Whatever the result at Huish Park, Manchester United's manager will take a right in the tunnel and enter Yeovil Town’s self-proclaimed ‘Bunker’.

It’s the ominous-sounding office of Gary Johnson and where the manager has been plotting the downfall of English football’s biggest name for the last six days.

Van Gaal will slip inside to share a bottle of red post-match, but has been warned he may have to bring his own.

Manchester United and Louis van Gaal are Yeovil's next opposition in the tournament 

‘There are no windows,’ Johnson told Sportsmail before a game he puts up there with the biggest in their history. ‘If it’s fresh air he wants then we’ll have to go outside.’

‘Unfortunately if Louis wants an expensive bottle of wine in my office afterwards he’s going to have to bring it with him - he’s probably got a stash somewhere in his kit bag. We’ll go for a mediocre red, but if he wants a real top one then I’ll be happy to share.’

How much they are willing to spend on a decent Merlot isn’t the only thing that’s a little different about these two clubs. Yeovil’s weekly wage budget stands at £37,500 - the amount Radamel Falcao earns in a single day. Wayne Rooney takes home more in a month than the minnows shell out in a year.

Not that it really bothers Johnson, who is the epitome of pragmatism but holds that sparkle which fills this small town with hope of an unlikely upset to match their greatest ever against Sunderland in 1947. Incidentally, the prize for that scalp was an 8-0 drubbing against Sunday’s opposition.

Position: 24th in League One

MANCHESTER UNITED

Annual wage budget: £215m

Home capacity: 75,635

Position: 3rd in Premier League

‘We’d like to keep our reputation as a good FA Cup side,’ he added. ‘We’ve told all the new lads that Yeovil were the best non-league team for cup upsets for years, and that we do well when we’re the underdogs. We’re certainly the underdogs here by a million miles.’

They are even more up against it than when the draw was made, with Johnson fully admitting that Yeovil have taken their eye off the ball since beating Accrington in the second round replay.

None more so than on Monday, when they were battered 3-0 at home against Leyton Orient in a defeat which leaves them rock bottom of League One.

‘Some of the players subconsciously saved themselves in that game and lost their place for United. They will learn from that pretty quick.

But Johnson revealed Van Gaal may have to bring his own wine if he has expensive taste

‘If Louis watched us against Leyton Orient he’d probably feel they could put out their Under 14s against us.

‘We’ve had to get those games out of the way first if you like. This is a different kettle of fish. Hopefully the boys will go in with a different feeling, without the pressure of the points. Now it’s finally here we just can’t wait.’

Johnson - who says his experience managing Latvia stands him in good stead for games such as this - cannot be far off legend status in this pocket of the West Country. He was the man who won promotion to the Football League in 2003 and then did the unthinkable by taking Yeovil to the Championship two years ago.

‘If we win they might even put a statute up of me,’ he laughed. ‘I reckon I’ve earned one already, but the chairman says I’ve got to do a little bit more yet. I’m only 5’7” so it wouldn’t take a lot of metal, would it?’

Johnson’s side are going to have to show more than a bit of mettle if they want to inflict anything worse than a cheap bottle of wine on Van Gaal.
