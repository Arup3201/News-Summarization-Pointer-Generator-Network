Pestered: Charlotte Green said the BBC World Service had a 'panic button' for women to press

A former Radio 4 newsreader has claimed that the BBC World Service had a 'panic button' for women to press when they were at the mercy of the wandering hands of male colleagues in the 1970s.

Charlotte Green, who joined the BBC in 1978 as a studio manager and retired in 2013, was at one time 'the voice' of BBC news bulletins. 

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival, the 58-year-old said that staff at Bush House, the former headquarters of the World Service, referred to the alarm as an 'emergency button'.

She said: 'I think mainly because one or two people did fancy themselves as dashing lotharios and possibly on night shift might get carried away.'

She added that 'it had never actually happened at Bush House but it was there just in case there were problems'.

Miss Green’s comments come as the BBC finds itself embroiled in a series of investigations, accusations and scandals relating to sexual abuse committed by employees. 

High profile figures include Jimmy Savile, Stuart Hall, Dave Lee Travis and Rolf Harris. 

The corporation said the buttons were still in their studios and were standard practice for a number of emergencies, including technical failure or if someone falls ill.

Last week, Miss Green, who is promoting her memoir -The News Is Read By Charlotte Green - revealed how she was harassed by the ‘wandering hands’ of a BBC colleague she worked with in the 1970s.

She said the studio manager, would touch her inappropriately, and when she complained was told he was simply ‘being friendly’.

She told the Festival – supported by the Daily Mail – that she tried at all costs to avoid being in the same room as the ‘pest’.

She added that she found herself repeatedly having to ‘make a fuss’ about his unwanted attention, which happened in her 20s.

Eventually, he was finally kept away from her.

Alarm: Miss Green said that staff at Bush House, the former headquarters of the World Service, referred to the alarm as an 'emergency button'

She said: ‘Unfortunately, it was my least favourite studio manager who was putting the programme out. He had wandering hands, so I kept well away from him.

‘Fortunately you could say to him – and I won’t say his name – “oh for goodness sake, stop being silly and just get off me” and he would.

‘But I’m afraid this was the 1970s and as we’re hearing so much about lately, with far worse examples, he was a nuisance and he was a pest. I did have to complain about him because it would happen quite frequently.’

Miss Green, who is now a presenter on Classic FM but in the past has also been involved with the Shipping Forecast and The News Quiz programmes on Radio 4, said when she complained her objections were dismissed by senior colleagues, reports The Times.

Miss Green added that 'it had never actually happened at Bush House (pictured) but it was there just in case there were problems'

She said: ‘I went to my line manager and said “this isn’t good enough, I’m not putting up with this”.

‘And he just looked at me and said “well he’s just being friendly”, which looking back now is astonishing, but that was the attitude.

‘I had to make a real fuss and in the end. I said “I won’t work with him, I’m not going to put up with that”. And eventually he was kept well away from me and I didn’t have to work with him but I shouldn’t have had to make a fuss. But that was how things were in the late 70s, sadly.’

A BBC spokesman said: ‘Behaviour like this is not tolerated in the BBC of today and we would encourage anyone with information on such issues to speak to the police.’
