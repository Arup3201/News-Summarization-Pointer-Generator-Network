Singer reported to have started dating Tre Holloway in March 2011 - five months after they danced together on The X Factor

She's only got six weeks to go before the start of her first UK solo tour, so Cheryl Cole has been working hard to ensure everything is perfect before she hits the stage.

And to prove how much she is putting into preparations, the singer posted a 'sweaty' photo of her after rehearsals on her Twitter page.

The X Factor judge's candid snap comes as it was reported she has been dating her 'new' boyfriend Tre Holloway since March last year.

Heat magazine claim Cheryl started seeing Tre, 27, in March 2011 - five months after they danced together during her performance of Promise This on The X Factor.

In March last year, Tre updated his Facebook page to say 'in a relationship', but then hid his relationship status after friends started questioning who his mystery girlfriend was.

The publication claims the pair have been enjoying incognito dates in Los Angeles - where Tre is based - and London as often as possible.

However, its only been in the past few weeks they've have been photographed together in public.

Last week, they were photographed together on three dates, including one night out with her Girls Aloud bandmates Kimberley Walsh and Nicola Roberts.

A source told Heat: 'Earning Cheryl’s trust is no mean feat. 
She’s very cautious about relationships and rarely lets anyone into her 
life, so she’s been taking it slow and keeping it under wraps for a long
 time.

'It’s a huge statement that Cheryl has 
now stepped out with Tre. It shows that she’s really 
confident that she’s got something special with Tre, and that they’ll be
 seeing a lot more of each other. To be let into Cheryl’s circle, which 
is very tight, really means something.'

Cheryl's new, or not so new, romance comes as she's preparing for her tour, which kicks off in Belfast on October 3.

Following rehearsals yesterday, she posted a photo on Twitter with her long hair scrapped back, looking slightly oily, without a scrap of make-up on and a healthy-looking glow on her face from the exercise.

She wrote: 'Sweaty hair, sweaty face and sore toe but first day of rehearsals is over!! Phew!! EXCITING!!'

She then added: 'Lol @ myself in that picture #ohgod!!'

She announced her tour dates in June shortly after she was criticised for her singing during the Queen's Jubilee concert.

In an interview shortly afterwards, she said: 'I am very aware of my ability, I know I’m no Mariah Carey but I think the emotion in the song is what matters. It's making people feel what you’re singing about.'
