Raheem Sterling headed in Liverpool's opener in their 3-1 Capital One Cup quarter-final victory over Bournemouth on Wednesday to cap off a remarkable 51-pass move.

The Reds kept possession for two-and-a-half minutes during the passage of play leading up to Sterling's exquisite team goal.

Inspired by Sterling's strike, here Sportsmail takes a look at the five best-ever team goals...

ESTEBAN CAMBIASSO (ARGENTINA vs Serbia and Montenegro, 2006 World Cup Group Stage)

This goal showed Argentina at their very beautiful best.

After winning their first game of the World Cup in Germany against Ivory Coast, Argentina would have been confident heading into the game against the highly-rated Serbia and Montenegro.

And that confidence almost came across as arrogance when defensive midfielder Esteban Cambiasso slotted home to finish off a 25-pass move.

Sometimes 'tiki-taka' style goals involve passing just for the very sake of it, but not this one.

Argentina started with the ball in their own half before gradually building up the play with some slick one-touch passes.

Eventually they made their way into the Serbia box and, after a neat backheel into his path, Cambiasso smashed home from 15 yards.

CARLOS ALBERTO (BRAZIL vs Italy, 1970 World Cup Final)

The samba stars of the seventies are widely regarded as one of the best teams of all time, blessed with the likes of Pele and Rivelino, and this goal encapsulates everything that was so majestic about them. 

After missing out on the World Cup in England in 1966, Brazil were back with a bang in Mexico, led out by marauding right back Carlos Alberto.

The captain scored the clincher in a 4-1 victory over Italy at the iconic Azteca Stadium, firing home a low drive into the bottom corner from the right-hand side. 

Brazil toyed with the Italians, with a total of eight of their outfield players passing the ball - Tostao, Brito, Clodoaldo, Pele, Gerson, Rivelino, Jairzinho and Alberto - before the captain hammered home to seal the World Cup.

Clodoaldo even had time to jink inside and outside of four Italians before continuing the move.

Alberto's finish followed a magnificent ball down the right-hand side from Pele after Tostao pointed out that Alberto was advancing at some speed. Simply unbelievable.

JACK WILSHERE (ARSENAL vs Norwich City, Premier League 2013/14)

This goal wowed Arsenal fans and neutrals alike last season as the Gunners cut through the Norwich City defence before Wilshere finished exquisitely.

The intricate passing and fancy flicks between Santi Cazorla, Olivier Giroud and England midfielder Wilshere were simply sublime to watch.

I implore you to watch this goal and not gasp if you have not seen it before, such is the beauty and precision of the move.

The outrageous move sliced apart a Norwich defence who just watched in awe as Arsenal showed what their neat passing can actually achieve at its very best.

Wilshere then calmly slotted home to cap off a magnificent team goal.

MARK DAVIES (BOLTON  vs Blackpool, Premier League 2010/11)

Unfortunately this is not the sort of goal you would associate with Bolton nowadays, but at the time under Owen Coyle they were flying high and sat fifth in the Premier League.

The confidence was clearly flowing through the veins as they faced Blackpool in this match.

Despite going two goals down, Wanderers were not to be denied and, having already pulled one back, the team put together a brilliant move to force an equaliser.

With just a minute remaining, Kevin Davies slotted the ball through to Johan Elmander who was running away from goal.

The big striker then backheeled the ball to Ivan Klasnic, who helped it on into the path of Mark Davies to hit home. Lovely.

ANDRES INIESTA (BARCELONA vs Celtic, Champions League Group Stage 2012/13)

There is an almost endless list of Barcelona goals which you could choose from but we had to narrow it down to just one from the tiki-taka masters.

But this goal, finished off by Spaniard Iniesta, is sublime and shows everything that Barcelona are about when they are at their very best.

The Catalan giants were 1-0 down at the Nou Camp approaching half-time against Celtic but produced one of their most-exquisite passing triangles on the edge of the box.

Having kept possession for more than 20 seconds, suddenly the ball found its way to Lionel Messi who surged across the edge of the box at pace.

He fed Iniesta who, in order to complete Barca's holy trio, played in Xavi. His pass-master team-mate then returned the ball to Iniesta before the latter finished into the bottom corner. Simply breathtaking.
