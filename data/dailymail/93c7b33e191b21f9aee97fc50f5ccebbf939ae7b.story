A contractor cleaning up a foreclosed home got the surprise of a lifetime when he made a shocking discovery - 56 boxes of cremated remains.

Each of the plastic boxes found in the Dayton, Ohio, home on Tuesday each contained the ashes of one person - and they date back as far as 1982.

Authorities said that the remains were the same ones that a state agency found earlier at a now-closed funeral home owned by the same woman who owns the home, Scherrie McLin.

Discovery: A contractor cleaning up the foreclosed home located at 2121 Philadelphia Street found the 56 boxes of cremated remains in a closet on Tuesday

The house, located at 2121 Philadelphia Street, was purchased several days ago after it had fallen into foreclosure.

The contractor who was hired by the buyer to clean up the place, found the boxes in a closet, labeled with the names and dates of deceased individuals.

Montgomery County Coroner's Office director Ken Betz told MailOnline that the information has helped them in the next step of the investigation - notifying next of kin.

He said that in one case, a body was cremated, but the family was not given the remains because they owed money to the funeral home.

Investigation: The cremated remains were in the same 56 boxes that were found by authorities at the McLin funeral home last year

In another, there appeared to be confusion over which family member had the remains, when they had been in the funeral home’s possession the whole time.

Betz said he’s confident that media attention on the case will cause some families to come forward.

He said: 'I anticipate that we’ll have a number of folks calling in to find out if we have their remains.'

The Dayton Daily News reported that McLin’s mortuary license was revoked in January amid accusations that she held a body for ransom.

Mystery: It is not clear when the remains were moved to the residence on Philadelphia Street

Executive director of Ohio's Board of Embalmers and Funeral Directors, Vanessa Kiekamp, said that investigators found the same 56 boxes last October at the McLin Funeral Home. 

Kiekamp said that investigators then notified the county prosecutor, who didn't immediately return calls on Wednesday.

It is not clear when the remains were moved to the residence on Philadelphia Street.

McLin couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday.

She is the half-sister of Dayton’s former Mayor Rhine McLin, who served from 2002 to 2010.
