Thierry Henry has spoken of his love for Arsenal's spiritual home of Highbury as he prepares to face his former club tomorrow.

The Gunners legend, who now plays for MLS franchise New York Red Bulls, will face his former club in Arsene Wenger side's second pre-season clash.

Henry is still idolised by Arsenal fans, and has a statue of himself outside the Emirates Stadium.

But when asked to compare the Emirates with his current home, the Red Bulls Arena, Henry said: 'You forgot my beloved Highbury!

'Hopefully the stadium will be full for the game against Arsenal - it will be what we do on the pitch that will make the stadium vibrate.' 

Saturday's friendly isn't the first time Henry has faced his ex-employers, having played against them in the Emirates Cup 2011.

Mutual respect: Henry was a revelation under Wenger at Arsenal

'I felt emotional when I played against them in the Emirates Cup for the first time, but it's different here in New York, plus I go there every year to train in the off season,' said the Frenchman.

'So it's not the same when as when I went back for the first time for Emirates Cup. This is a friendly game so this is different, my mind is on the league game Salt Lake next week. 

'It's nice because it's against Arsenal, but we don't get three points, it's a friendly.'

He added: 'What was the highlight of my Arsenal career? Wearing the shirt. 

'Wearing the shirt was a privilege, I understood that more when I left. Those seven or eight games I played when I went back on loan in 2012, I realised how important it is to wear the shirt. 

'It was unbelievable, I felt a different man with this shirt.'
