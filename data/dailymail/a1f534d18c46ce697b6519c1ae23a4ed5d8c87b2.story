Islamic State religious police have been filmed beating musicians and destroying their instruments as punishment for playing an 'un-Islamic' keyboard.

The men were pictured being hit across the back and legs with a wooden stick in a public square after ISIS's fanatical Islamic enforcers ruled the electric keyboard was 'offensive to Muslims'.

Another picture shows two keyboards and what appears to be a lute smashed to pieces after raids thought to have taken place in Bujaq, a few miles to the east of Aleppo in  Syria.

Musicians in Syria were given 90 lashes each after they were caught by the Islamic State's religious police playing an electric keyboard, which they deemed 'offensive to Muslims', according to pictures posted online

Pictures show the men being beaten on their backs and legs by tribal elders in a public square believed to be in Bujaq, a town to the north east of Aleppo

According to text posted along with the images on a file-sharing website, the musicians were punished with 90 lashes alongside a man caught impersonating a 'hisbah'.

The Arabic term generally refers to the obligation on Muslim leaders to uphold the law, but in this context likely refers to a local official or tribal elder.

According to the online post, which claims to have come from ISIS's information office in Aleppo, a man caught smuggling cigarettes was also punished with 50 lashes.

Since taking control of large parts of Syria and Iraq last year ISIS claims to have formed a Caliphate in the Middle East, and has taken to enforcing strict Sharia law within its borders.

Thieves are regularly pictured having their hands or arms amputated in public squares amid crowds of onlookers, while adulterers have been executed.

The men were apparently caught playing electronic keyboards, and what appears to be a lute, instruments that were deemed to be 'un-Islamic' by ISIS's fanatical religious police

After the men had been beaten the instruments were destroyed. ISIS has been enforcing a terrifying vision of Sharia law across its so-called Caliphate, including executing people for breeding pigeons

Earlier today, it was reported that at least 15 pigeon breeders in eastern Iraq were rounded up  after ISIS ruled the sport distracted them from praising Allah.

Three of those held by the group in the eastern province of Diyala have reportedly been killed, according to a security official.

Abu Abdullah, a farmer, said a total of six gunmen barged into his home earlier this week and dragged away his 21-year-old son.

Mr Abdullah's son is just one of the 15 young men – all aged between 16 and 22 – who have reportedly been captured in the province for breeding birds.

Yesterday it was reported that 13 youngsters were killed by firing squad in Iraq's second city of Mosul for watching an Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan. 

According to Arabic script posted alongside the pictures, the men were given 90 lashes, along with another man caught impersonating a hisbah - likely referring to a local official or elder

The message, which claims to be from the information office in Aleppo, also said another man was given 50 lashes for helping to smuggle cigarettes into the country

Activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, which operates out of Syria, reported that the teenagers were shot in public and their bodies left there as their parents are too afraid to go and get them.

The boys' 'crime' - breaking religious laws by watching football - was read out on a loudspeaker before their executions.

It came just days after ISIS released a video showing two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay.

A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities.

He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law.

The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their death.

Just a few days ago footage emerged showing men being thrown off the top of a 100ft tower in Raqqa, Syria, after being accused of being gay by ISIS police
