Twin girls who have been on a primary school waiting list for four years could be separated because the school both want to go to refuses to buy an extra chair for a teaching assistant their father has claimed.

Mia and Hannah Hendry, aged seven, have been on the waiting list at the All Saints Church of England school in Carshalton since they were three, due to the huge pressure on primary school places in London.

Mia was recently offered a place at the Sutton School but her parents had to reject it as it was mean separating the two girls, they said.

Sister Hannah was then offered a place at the same school as she was next on its waiting list, but her family had to make the same decision in a bid to keep the twins together.

This evening, the twins' father Phil, a TV producer, said that the school had a policy that meant that pupils sat in tables of six, but with class numbers limited to 35.

Mr Hendry said that the final chair is used by a teaching assistant, and that the school is refusing to buy an extra for the assistant to sit on so the class can be expanded to 36 to cater for the twins.

Mr Hendry added that when he threatened the school with a judicial review at the High Court they claimed they were willing to take the fight there.

He added: 'The school’s unwillingness to find a way to keep our twins together, having known of their existence for the years we’ve sat patiently on the waiting list, is a source of deep and lasting regret that is already turning to bitterness and anger.'

He added: 'I feel I owe it to all parents of twins and multiple birth to highlight what has happened to us and to fight for a proper legal right for twins to be schooled together.'

Reverend Dr John Thewlis, Chairman of Governors at All Saints Carshalton Church of England Primary School said:'The school places issue is not to do with the number of chairs in a class room. It is due to the pressure on places, on physical space, and the fact that the class size is already 35. If the situation could have been solved by purchasing a simple chair, this certainly would have been done.'

Hannah and Mia currently go to school together 
in Lambeth where the family lived before moving to Sutton, and face a 
seven-mile journey to school.

Councillor Kirsty Jerome, executive member for education and schools at Sutton council, said: “We appreciate Mr Hendry’s frustration and wish it were possible to offer both twins a place but Sutton has some of the best schools in the country and this is a very popular school.

'Finding two spaces in one year group at All Saints is very rare so it’s not always possible for parents who move during the school year to get a place at their first choice school.

The twins have been offered separate places at All Saints Church of England Primary School in Carshalton, but cannot attend together

'We’ve invested millions to cope with London’s baby boom and this school is one of the five primary schools we are expanding this year.”

Schools in Sutton are among the most overcrowded, with 26 primary schools full to capacity, teaching 415 more pupils than they should be.  

Elsewhere, Brindishe Lee school in Lewisham has 239 pupils but just 155 official places. Galliard primary in Enfield is 30 per cent over capacity, with 661 pupils for 510 official places.

The Islamia primary school in Brent has 391 students, but officially has 210 places.

Latest figures show that 514 primary schools in London are facing similar problems, and are either full or already over capacity.

The number of children needing a school place in London is expected to grow by 100,000 over the next five years.

Evening Standard research reveals some of the most popular primary schools in the capital are coping with huge demand for places by taking more children than they have capacity for.

New figures show that 428 primary schools are over capacity and are taking an extra 8,000 pupils too many between them. Some are squeezing in 100 extra pupils or more to cope with demand.
