Talk about taking on the Brazilians at their own game. 

Liverpool academy star Adam Phillips showed his class on Sunday by scoring a glorious last-gasp equaliser against the South Americans for England Under 17s.

The 16-year-old midfielder, who travelled with Brendan Rodgers' first-team squad on their United States tour last summer, looped home an exquisite 25-yarder in the eighth minute of injury time to earn 10-man England an unlikely 2-2 draw.

The Under 17s are currently out in Sarasota, Florida competing in the Nike International Tournament along with Brazil, the United States and Australia.

Having lost 3-1 to the States in their first match on Friday, England were staring at a second defeat when they won a corner just as the clock was about to tick past 97 minutes.

But after Sunderland's Daniel Wright played the ball out to him, Phillips curled the ball over a mass of bodies inside the penalty box and watched as it dropped over the despairing dive of Brazil goalkeeper Bruno Bertinato.

The goals sparked wild celebrations, with England's substitutes rushing from the bench onto the pitch to celebrate with Phillips.

'Great moment for me scoring last minute against Brazil!! Great team effort bring on Australia!!!' tweeted an excited Phillips afterwards. He later added: 'What a game football is.'

Phillips is regarded as one of Liverpool's brightest young talents and this was the latest demonstration of his class and ability.

He hails from the Lancashire town of Garstang and joined Liverpool's academy at the age of 11 having spent three years with Blackburn Rovers.

He joined Neil Critchley's Under 18 squad at the club's Kirby Academy in the summer but received a surprise promotion after impressing Rodgers in a pre-season friendly with Brondby on July 16.

Phillips came on for Fabio Borini at half-time and, despite losing the match 2-1, did enough to win himself a place in Liverpool's 33-strong playing squad for the US Tour.

So within a few weeks of finishing his studies at Rainhill School, where many of the club's scholars are educated, he was travelling alongside the likes of Steven Gerrard, Raheem Sterling and Daniel Sturridge.

'Dreams do really come true,' tweeted Phillips at the time.

Critchley told the Liverpool Echo following his call-up: 'Adam came down for the first day two weeks ago when I did an induction meeting with the first years to welcome them aboard and tell them what to expect over the coming year.

'On the following Monday, Adam was called down to train with the first team at Melwood and we haven't seen him since.

'I'm not surprised that the manager is keen to have a good look at him. He's a talented lad who can play in a number of positions. He played wide right against Brondby but he can also play centrally.

'He played No 6, No 8 and No 10 for the U18s last season. He has a great range of passing and he can score goals. He can do a bit of everything.'

His call-up meant Phillips had to wave the chequered flag on his other great passion - cycle speedway.

He had joined Astley and Tyldesley Cycle Speedway club at the age of four and was a three-time British champion.

Phillips played the last five minutes of Liverpool's first tour match against Roma in Boston and gained valuable experience during the trip.

This season, Phillips made his Under 21 debut, scoring twice in the 4-3 defeat to Manchester City and has also played in two UEFA Youth League fixtures.

Internationally, Phillips made two appearances for England Under 16s, scoring the winner against Portugal in the Montaigu Tournament back in April, and was called up by John Peacock for the Florida tournament last month.
