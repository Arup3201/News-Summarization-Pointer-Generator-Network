Manchester City defender Micah Richards, who is currently on loan at Serie A side Fiorentina and is out of contract at the end of the season, has said that the chances of first-team football will be the main factor in deciding his next move. 

Richards told TalkSport on Wednesday, 'It's difficult to say [where I will play] at the moment.' He added, 'Every footballer can go to a bigger club on a free contract but for me, I'm still only 26 and I just want to play every game, that's what's important.'

Richards has recently been linked with a switch to Inter Milan, now manged by his former City boss Roberto Mancini.

The England international, who has 13 caps for his country, graduated from City's academy in 2005 and for a few years commanded a regular starting berth for the Sky Blues.

However, thanks to a mix of injuries, squad rotation and a string of high profile defensive signings sanctioned by the club's wealthy owners, Richards' opportunities at the Etihad Stadium gradually became more limited.  

On a possible return to English football Richards admitted, 'Everyone wants to play in the Premier League, it's still the best league in the world and the most entertaining.' 

And surely when he does become a free agent in the summer, the right-back will not be short of potential suitors both at home and abroad.

When Richards' contract expires, he will undoubtedly have no shortage of potential suitors
