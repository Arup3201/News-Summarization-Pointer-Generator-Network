A mother of conjoined twins who was told her unborn babies wouldn't survive pregnancy has finally welcomed them home.

'We were told that I was going to have a stillbirth,' new mom Michelle Van Horn, from Indiana, Pennsylvania told WPXI.

But after the safe arrival of little Andrew and Garrett, who share a heart and a liver, Ms Van Horn said they are 'doing everything a normal infant would do. That's why 
we see them as our miracle babies'.

'They're breathing good. They're 
crying,' she said.

The babies are conjoined from the chest to the navel and because they share two vital organs, Ms Van Horn and her boyfriend Kyle Stancombe made the decision not to separate them when they were born.

So far, dressing them has proved a challenge, but the new parents are tackling it with glee.

'We basically take two outfits and snap them together,' said Ms Van Horn.

'They'll continue to fight until it's their time. We will love them and cherish them until that moment and continue even after,' said Ms said Van Horn

According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, conjoined twins happen one in every 200,000 births, and their survival is anything but assured.

Approximately 60per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and 
about 35per cent survive only one day. 

That her sons have made it this far is nothing short of a mircale, says Ms Von Horn, but added that it is heartbreaking to care for her sons knowing they might not survive.

'Theyâ€™ll continue to fight until itâ€™s their time. We will love them and cherish them until that moment and continue even after,' said Ms said Van Horn.
