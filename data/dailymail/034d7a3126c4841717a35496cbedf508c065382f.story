For many they are a key part of the World Cup build up, but it has been claimed pupils have been banned from swapping Panini football stickers in their school playground because 'it's annoying for teachers'.

The collectables, featuring stars such as Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, and Neymar, have reportedly been blamed for a number of playground bustups between young football fans.

It has been claimed that teachers at Battyeford
 Primary School in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, became so fed up as their 
pupils' desire for the stickers reached fever pitch that they have 
banned them from the playground.

Craze: Pupils have been banned from swapping Panini football stickers in their school playground because 'it's annoying for teachers', it is claimed

'Pupils were getting into fights and teachers were getting annoyed,' childminder Lisa Davies-Unger, 47, who looks after children at the school, told The Sun.

'It's a distraction so I suppose that led to the ban.'

However, a spokesman at the school said children had not been banned from 
bringing the stickers to school, and were even encouraged to swap the 
stickers as part of a school club.

'There is no ban on children bringing stickers into school,' he said. 

'Children are welcome to bring in their stickers and they are doing so with the blessing of staff. We even have a special club where children can get together and swap them in their free time.'

Panini, which has the exclusive rights 
from FIFA to produce and sell the tournament's official sticker album 
expects this year's edition to be the most popular yet, with billions 
sold before and during this year's competition.

Already 40million of the packets, which sell for around 50p, have been bought - and no doubt swapped - worldwide.

And last week it was reported that a teacher in the Columbian city of Bucaramanga had been accused of confiscating stickers from pupils, and using them to complete his own Panini album.

According to local media a 13-year-old boy reported seeing the teacher in the staff room filling his album with the stickers taken from children.

Last month Panini had to reassure fans in Brazil that there would not be a shortage of stickers after thieves hijacked a van containing 300,000 of them.

Football stickers are popular around the globe

Collectible football cards and stickers have been swapped by young football fans since the late 1880s when they were frequently found inside cigarette packets.

Italian company Panini started selling packets of football stickers in the 1960s and in 1970 produced its first World Cup album to tie in with that year's tournament in Mexico - selling the stickers outside of Italy for the first time.

Football stickers took off in the UK in 1978, when the World Cup was being held in Argentina.

A 1980s market research survey revealed that more than 90 percent of boys aged between nine and 11 had bought at least one packet of football stickers.

And by the 1990s collecting stickers was a full blown phenomenon, with girls and boys alike eagerly trading 'shinys' as they tried to complete the set.

In 1994 multiple re-prints were needed for sticker company Merlin's first official Premier League collection, such was the demand.

Last November, 29-year-old Portsmouth 
fan and comedy writer Adam Carroll-Smith made headlines when he tracked 
down the six players whose faces were missing from his 1996 Merlin 
Premier League Album.

It 
took him six months to trace Keith Curle, Stuart Ripley, Scott Minto, 
Gary Penrice, Philippe Albert and Lars Bohinen, visit them and take 
their pictures to fill in the gaps in his album, documenting his efforts
 in his book Six Stickers: A Journey To Complete An Old Sticker Album.

Every year Panini prints more than a billion stickers, and as well as football stickers also print ranges featuring cartoon characters such as Peppa Pig and bands including One Direction.

In the 2013/14 season Topps, which has owned the rights to Merlin since 1995, celebrated the 20th anniversary of the official Premier League Sticker collection.

Topps also produces Match Attax, a trading card game which also features Premier League stars.
