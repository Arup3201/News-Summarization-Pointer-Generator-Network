Ms de Souza lived in the building that she was killed in with her family - her mother worked with her as a receptionist.

enemies. Now we do not know what it will do, whether to continue living 
there,' he said.

'I hope no one has to go through the pain I'm going 
through.'

It is understood that Ms de Souza worried about her safety and paid a monthly fee to a  security firm

Victoria Fernandes, who was a neighbour of the dentist and patient, but was not in office at the time of the crime, spoke about the professional.

'She was a very good, very simple, did not charge consultation, just the treatment that was going to do, and depending on the treatment, nor charged,' he said.
