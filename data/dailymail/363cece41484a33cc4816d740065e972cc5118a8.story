They’ve been spotted at the beach, by the back yard BBQ and cruising down main streets.

Once a rare species, brush turkeys have made a remarkably bold comeback with their population increasing 700 per cent in the last 20 years in Brisbane, Queensland, alone.

Now one top scientist has warned the red-necked game birds - also commonly known as bush and scrub turkeys - are heading for the expensive gardens of Sydney.

Behavioural ecologist Professor Darryl Jones told the ABC there is nothing to stop the protected species which have taken over Brisbane and are now making their way south.

In Byron Bay, this brush turkey came over to investigate one beach goer's belongings 

This turkey was spotted making a mess by one Instagram user, who wrote: 'That's a nice path. It'd be a shame if someone kicked mulch all over it'

‘I'm constantly getting reports from down in Sydney about “what the hell are we going to do about these big birds - they're destroying our gardens”, which we've known about for 30 years,’ he said.

Professor Jones said despite the fact that they aren’t very smart, the birds are tough.

‘Sydney can expect an avalanche in the next 20 years of more and more brush turkeys because they love it – somehow or other they survive.’

The bird, which has a mainly black body plumage, bare red head, yellow throat wattle, has been spotted along eastern Australia, from Cape York Peninsula, Queensland, south to the northern suburbs of Sydney and the Illawarra region of New South Wales.

Bemused members of the public and bird lovers have shared their bizarre brush turkey sightings on social media.

And as their population continues to expand, with female brush turkeys laying 20 to 30 eggs a year, experts have suggested those who want to avoid their garden being inhabited by the bird temporarily lay down chicken wire on their lawn if they spot one starting to dig.
