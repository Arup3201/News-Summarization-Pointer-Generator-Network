Andreea (left and right, with her identity obscured) and Bogdan were engaged to each other by their parents while they were children as is common in Roma communities

The couple were engaged to each other as children by their parents, and while their families have never released Andreea's exact age, this latest announcement means she will be turning 18 soon.

It is anticipated that the wedding will take place in the Transylvanian city of Sibiu in central Romania sometime in the autumn.

The ceremony will likely be timed mark the one year anniversary of the death of the former 'King of Gipsies' Florin Cioaba, who is Bogdan's grandfather.

Florin, who proclaimed himself 'King of Roma Everywhere', died on 18 August 2013 of cardiac arrest at the Akdeniz University in Antalya in Turkey.

It is expected that his two great-grandchildren, Bogdan and Andreea's twins, will also be officially baptised at the autumn ceremony.

A spokesman for the family confirmed: 'She is still under 18, and therefore we want to protect her privacy until after the wedding.

'When the wedding happens then all the questions of the curious will be answered.'

The spokesman also confirmed that all of Bogdan's family had fallen in love with Andreea as she was 'beautiful and kind' but also an 'obedient and dutiful daughter-in-law'.

The marriage will make the couple's two twin children the next in line to the Roma crown.

Roma have often clashed with officials in Romania over their beliefs, especially the controversial tradition of marrying their children off young.

Many engagements in Roma communities are arranged by parents when the youngsters are still under ten years old.

Confirmation ceremonies, which are held to formalise the union, have been known to take place with children as young as eight.

Although the Gipsy King's family have stated in the past that they are not in favour of under-aged marriages, Dorin's sister Ana Maria Cioab was at the centre of an international row after she was married aged 12.

The huge and highly controversial public ceremony saw her married to 15-year-old Mihai Birita.

The affair caused outcry, and was even raised in the European Parliament after Romania came under fire for not taking action against the Roma.

Dorin's father Florin eventually apologised for the decision and agreed to work with Romanian officials to make sure the age of consent was raised within Roma communities.
