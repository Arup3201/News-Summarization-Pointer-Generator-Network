Olympic hero: Mark Lenzi, who won the gold medal for diving in 1992, has died suddenly at the age of 43

The last American diver to win gold at the Olympics has died suddenly at the age of 43.

Mark Lenzi won gold when he switched from wrestling to diving in the mid-1980s.

Over the next decade, he became the 1992 Olympic three-meter springboard champion, earned a bronze medal four years later in Atlanta and became the first diver to score 100 points on a single dive.

Lenzi passed away in Greenville, North Carolina on Monday.

Lenzi is survived by his wife Dorothy, his mother, two brothers, one sister and grandmother Mary Cochran.

His alma mater, Indiana University, posted the announcement on its website but did not provide a cause of death.

His
mother Ellie told the family's hometown newspaper, The Free 
Lance-Star in Fredricksburg, Virginia that her son had been 
hospitalized the past two weeks because of fainting spells that were 
caused by low blood pressure.

Former
Olympic teammate and current Texas diving coach Matt Scoggin told USA 
Diving: 'Mark came from a wrestling background and the goal of any 
wrestler is to pin you.

'When
Mark got into a contest, he was going to pin you. I remember before his
first World Cup, he was going to win 1-meter, I thought there was no 
way â€“ it was my third World Cup and I was still trying to get on the 
podium.

'He won. He was a very confident competitor.'

Married life: Mark Lenzi with his wife Dorothy taken late last year

Lenzi wrestled in high school when he
was captivated by diver Greg Louganis' remarkable Olympics performance 
in 1984 and immediately changed discipline.

In
1989, he swept the Big Ten college titles in the one-meter, three-meter
and platform competitions, then went on to win the first of his 
back-to-back one-meter national championships in 1989. Lenzi was selected the National Collegiate Athletic Association's diver of the year in 1989 and 1990.

Words of condolences poured in for Olympian Mark Lenzi:

Mark and I spoke just a few weeks ago, my heart goes out to you. There
are no words to express how heartfelt a loss this is.

Greg Louganis, Olympic gold medalist diver

As an Olympic gold medalist, Mark was one of our country's greatest divers, and he will be missed tremendously.

USA Diving Chairman Bob Rydze

So sad. He was my '92 teammate.Thinking of his wife&family.

Summer Sanders, former Olympic swimmer

I remember when I missed making '96 Olympic Trials, Mark Lenzi sat down with me & told me to let it light a fire inside. He believed in me.

Laura Wilkinson, Olympic champion diver

He was just beginning to emerge on the international stage.

His victory on the three-meter board at the Barcelona Olympics gave the Americans their third straight title in that event.

Four years later, following a brief retirement, Lenzi earned an Olympic bronze medal.

No American male diver has won an Olympic diving medal since Lenzi in 1996.

His teammate Mr Scoggin added: 'Mark 
grabbed onto a dream.

'He wasn't going to believe anything was 
impossible. It was amazing how rapidly he became an Olympic champion.'

Lenzi's
impressive resume includes 18 international springboard championships.

He was the first diver to score more than 700 points in an 11-dive 
competition on the three-meter board and was the first American to 
successfully complete a forward, 4 1/2 somersault in competition.

'As
an Olympic gold and bronze medalist, Mark was one of our country's 
greatest divers, and he will be missed tremendously,' USA Diving 
chairman Bob Rydze said.

After
his diving career ended, Lenzi went into coaching.

He helped four 
divers win national age-group titles with Indiana's junior diving team 
and coached men's and women's divers at East Carolina from 2009-11.

His funeral and viewing will be held today at Wilkerson Funeral Home in Greensville from 6 to 8pm.

His hero Greg Louganis wrote on the USA Diving website:
'Mark and I spoke just a few weeks ago, my heart goes out to you. There
are no words to express how heartfelt a loss this is. Healing hugs, 
Greg.'
