The Disney film from which the hit song is taken has been described as a ‘musical epidemic sweeping the nation’.

And one best man who noticed its popularity  decided to surprise the bride and groom at a wedding with a version of Let It Go from Frozen.

The version by Joey Boyes, 27, of Saltburn-by-the-Sea, North Yorkshire, was written for his best friend Dominic Clark's wedding to Rebecca.

The remake - titled Best Man Joe - is the result of six months of writing, learning and annoying his friends and family with constant practising.

Lines from the song included: ‘After years of dating mingers, he's finally found a queen.

'Best man Joe, says hello, to the couple with the brightest spark. Best man Joe, says hello, to the brand new Mrs Clark.’

Mr Boyes said afterwards: ‘I've known Dom all my life and I wanted to do something special. We both did theatre when we were younger and Becky loves Disney so this seemed perfect.

‘It went down much better than I expected. I started writing it six months ago and I've been singing it constantly right up until their big day - even on the one-and-a-half hour drive to pick him up.'

Mr and Mrs Clark, both 28, tied the knot
 last Saturday after being together for seven years, and now live in 
Leeds, West Yorkshire.

'Musical epidemic sweeping the nation': Let It Go is from Frozen, Disney's biggest grossing movie ever

Mr Boyes said: ‘Our parents were friends before we were born. Dom was there at my first birthday party so I dropped a little line in about that.’

After the video went viral, he tweeted yesterday: 'Well not in a million years did I expect this sort of reaction! Thanks to everyone that shared. #BestManJoe'

Frozen is Disney’s biggest grossing movie ever. It was described by Mail columnist Lorraine Candy as ‘relentlessly gathering up every child under 16, male or female, in its cult-like grip’.

Its soundtrack album knocked Beyonce off the top of the U.S. Billboard chart, and remained at number one for a record nine weeks.

I have known him since we were very smallYou attended my first birthday, and my 17th bar brawlShe said I do, but she had chance to really think this throughIt's now too late to run away, I'd say,

I know your dad is smiling up there on his cloudAnd on behalf of him, I want to tell you he's so proudApart from that time you got mouthy with the copsI hope that sleepover taught you to shut your chops.
