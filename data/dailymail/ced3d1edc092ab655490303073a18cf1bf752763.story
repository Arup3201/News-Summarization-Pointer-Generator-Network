A plan to open a Kung Fu centre in a derelict hotel using £1.6million of public funds has been scrapped.

The proposed martial arts retreat in Llangollen, North Wales, was today described in a report into the failed project as a waste of money.

The Welsh Government bought the River Lodge Hotel in 2007 with the intention of leasing it back to community group Powys Fadog.

But delays led the building to become an unusable ruin, forcing the decision to abandon the centre.

Today a government committee described the purchase as a 'troubling' waste of public funds.

It had been the brainchild of martial arts expert Pol Wong who wanted to create the first Shaolin centre outside China.

Failure: The Welsh Government spent £1.6million on the River Lodge Hotel to turn it into a martial arts centre but it has never opened

He said: 'It's just a wreck and that for me is heartbreaking. That was
a dream that we'd achieved.

Dreams: Pol Wong, head of the Powys Fadog community group, had hoped to set up the first Shaolin temple outside of China

'We got permission from the Shaolin temple 
in China - these things don't come easy.

'To stop it like that is heartbreaking. It's been almost like a bereavement.'

Mr Wong, a monk, 
claims constant delays and obstacles created by the Assembly led to the 
building deteriorating to the point where it was unusable.

He claims to have invested £90,000 in the centre which he said would have generated 30 jobs.

He added: 'I am stunned and so depressed after we have worked so hard and spent so much money on the project.

'It's five years that have been wasted when we could have been employing people and bringing health and fitness to people.'

A report released last year said the 
purchase was 'flawed' and said evidence suggested the Welsh Government 
probably paid more than the property was worth.

It has since incurred costs of around £200,000 for maintenance and repairs of the building.

The Welsh Audit Office found that by June 2011, Powys Fadog had failed to provide evidence that it
had secured enough funding to undertake the necessary repairs and improvements to the building,  or to pay the rents 
due under the lease. 

The report also highlighted a 'significant' conflict of interest with a Welsh Government official involved with the project.

The Welsh Government's Public Accounts Committee made has now made 21 recommendations for improvements following the blunder.

Committee chair Darren Millar said: 'This inquiry has been one of the most illuminating and troubling ever undertaken by the committee.

'The fact that over £1m of public money has been wasted as a result of the various decisions taken in the course of this troubled project is concerning enough in itself.

'But it is the flaws in civil service systems and processes which this inquiry has exposed. It left us deeply uneasy.'

The Welsh Government said they would carefully consider the report.

A spokesman said: 'We recognise that there were shortcomings in the way in which the acquisition and disposal were dealt with.

'We will carefully consider the public accounts committee's report and respond formally to them.'
