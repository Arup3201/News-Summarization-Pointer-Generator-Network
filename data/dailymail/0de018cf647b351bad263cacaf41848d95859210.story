A female judge has said a man who took hundreds of photos up ladies' skirts at the Lincoln Memorial because she believes he did not violate their privacy.

Christopher Hunt Cleveland from Springfield, Virginia, was arrested in July 2013 after police officers caught him taking 'upskirt' shots of women sitting above him on the steps of the monument in Washington D.C.

He was then charged with voyeurism after officers reportedly found inappropriate images taken over more than a year on the camera's memory card, which he had tried to removed as he walked away.

However D.C. Superior Judge Juliet McKenna drop the case at the end of last month, suggesting women should have no expectation of privacy in a public place.

Case dropped: A judge ruled that Christopher Cleveland, who took hundreds of 'upskirt' photos of women at the Lincoln Memorial, did not violate their privacy and was not guilty of voyeurism (file picture) 

In her judgement, she wrote: 'This Court finds that no individual clothed and positioned in such a manner in a public area in broad daylight in the presence of countless other individuals could have a reasonable expectation of privacy.'

In her statement, she added: 'The images captured were not 'incidental glimpses' and in fact were images that were exposed to the public without requiring any extraordinary lengths whatsoever, to view.

'The photographs recovered from Mr Cleveland's camera memory card depict a variety of images ranging from long shots of the Washington Monument and Reflecting Pool and groups of people sitting on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, to close up photos of individual women seated or standing in the area.

'As Defendant's Response acknowledges some of these women are seated in such a way that their private areas, including the upper inches of their buttocks, are clearly visible.

'However, all of these images were similarly available to other passer-by in the area.' 

The court documents added that there was no evidence Mr. Cleveland positioned his camera in any waym or employed any photographic techniques , so as to capture images that were not already on public display.

Exposure: D.C. Superior Judge Juliet McKenna said women should have no expectation of privacy in a public place and that any person could have taken the photos he did

But she did question his behavior, saying: 'The fact that the Defendant was intentionally photographing publicly exposed areas of women's clothed and unclothed bodies…is repellent and disturbing.' 

After Cleveland was arrested, police also reportedly searched his car and found and found a laptop containing at least 150 PowerPoint slide presentations, each containing 30 or more upskirt images or images leading up to the shots. 

Park Police said the Lincoln Memorial steps are 'commonly used by individuals engaged in voyeuristic activity', but Cleveland avoided prosecution.

Some areas are however taking to steps to make sure it is against the law. 

In March, after a Massachusetts court ruled that upskirt photos were legal in the state, the legislature quickly pushed through a bill criminalizing it. 

In appropriate shots in the Bay State are now punishable by as many as five years in jail or fines up to $5,000. 

Texas also recently passed a law against photographs taken 'with the intent to arouse or gratify' sexual desire, though that wason First Amendment grounds.
