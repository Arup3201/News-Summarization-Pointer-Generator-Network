Scientists have long wondered why the U.S. and Europe are so culturally different to China and other countries in Eastern Asia.

Now one study claims the answer lies in an unexpected area: the different farming methods used by people living in the East and West.

While Westerners are known for their individualism and analytical thinking, eastern culture tends to be interdependent and holistic, the study claims.

Paddy rice in the East (right) cannot be grown without ample supplies of water, forcing neighbours to work together. It is also highly labour-intensive, requiring twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat. Western wheat farmers (left), in contrast, can rely on the rain and operate much more independently

Theories explaining the differences have included wealth and education fuelling individualism in the West, and high rates of infectious disease in the East causing people to be wary of outsiders.

But the real reason may simply be the way people at both ends of the world cultivate rice and wheat, say the scientists.

Paddy rice cannot be grown without ample supplies of water, forcing neighbours to work together to irrigate their crops.

It is also highly labour-intensive, requiring about twice the number of hours from planting to harvest as does wheat.

Scientists assessed known measures of individualism and collectivism in 1,000 people from different regions of China where rice and wheat are grown. The results, published in the journal Science, showed distinct psychological differences that mirrored those between the East and West

To test their theory, the scientists assessed known measures of individualism and collectivism in 1,000 people from different regions of China where rice and wheat are grown.

The results, published in the journal Science, showed distinct psychological differences that mirrored those between the East and West.

‘It’s easy to think of China as a single culture,’ said lead researcher Thomas Talhelm, from the University of Virginia.

‘But we found that China has very distinct northern and southern psychological cultures and that southern China’s history of rice farming can explain why people in southern China are more interdependent than people in the wheat-growing north.

‘The data suggests that legacies of farming are continuing to affect people in the modern world.’

The East Coast prefers Bud Light, and 
those near the coast are more likely to prefer wine over beer, a new 
study of America's drinking habits has revealed.

Researchers analysed a million tweets to find out which each region prefers.

They
 found tweet preferences for Bud Light were found mainly in the Eastern 
half of the U.S, while preferences for Coors Light originate in the 
Western half, particularly near Colorado and surrounding states.

Other beer spaces included Miller 
Lite preferences in the Midwest and Great Plains, and brands like Corona
 and Dos Equis in the Southern border regions of the U.S. 

Most wine-related tweets were sent from the wine-growing regions of Washington, Oregon, and northern and central California.

Overall,
 residents of the eastern and western US coastal regions were more 
partial to wine (or at least were more likely to tweet about it), while 
people from several Midwestern states and into Kansas, Oklahoma and 
Texas were more apt to tweet about beer.

It puts this down to fact that rice farming in the East requires teamwork
