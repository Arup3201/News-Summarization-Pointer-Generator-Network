A Victorian truck diver kidnapped two prostitutes and forced them into his live-in bus where he kept a homemade 'raping machine', a court has heard.

Serial sex offender Dennis William Newall is in jail for raping a backpacker in WA about four years ago, and was also sentenced to eight years prison in 2002 for raping a Melbourne sex worker.

The 56-year-old pleaded guilty on Thursday to kidnapping and raping two more St Kilda prostitutes on separate occasions in November and December 2001.

Both women thought they were going to die after Newall enticed them into his car, covered their heads and took them to his converted bus at Brooklyn, the Victorian County Court heard.

Newall kept a wooden cross-like structure on the bus and told one woman it was a 'sex machine' and he was planning to add a mechanical arm to it.

He asked one of his victims to 'rate his performance' after raping her, and later requested her phone number.

The court heard Newall forced his son, then 17, to help carry out one of the kidnappings.

His teenage son got in the boot of Newall's car and leapt out to place a pillowcase over the woman's head while she was in the back seat.

An unknown man was involved in the other kidnapping.

The women, who were aged 20 and 27 at the time, did not go to police about the attacks until recently.

Newall told one victim 'no one would believe a junkie whore' like her, she told the court.

Both women said they remained traumatised by what he had done.

One referred to his wooden, cross-like structure as a 'raping machine'.

'I couldn't wrap my head around the sadism and depravity needed to build such a machine,' she told the court.

All three Melbourne-based attacks took place within about a month, crown prosecutor John Livitsanos told the court.

Defence barrister Shaun Ginsbourg said Newall had developed remorse over his behaviour.

He will be sentenced at a later date.
