Fernando Alonso has been given the final green light to return to Formula One action in this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.

For the first time since his accident in pre-season testing in Barcelona in mid-February, Alonso will step back into his McLaren for Friday practice at the Sepang International Circuit.

The double world champion sustained concussion from the crash at the Circuit de Catalunya which forced him out of the final test, as well as the season-opening race in Australia 11 days ago.

But following a considerable amount of speculation over his future, and numerous tests, the Spaniard has cleared the final hurdle via an FIA medical inspection in Sepang.

An FIA statement read: 'In accordance with normal procedures, McLaren-Honda driver Fernando Alonso was this morning (Thursday) examined by the FIA medical delegate and chief medical officer at the Sepang circuit medical centre.

'During the examination the driver passed all mandatory fitness tests and has thus been declared fit to race in this weekend's Malaysian Grand Prix.'

A happy Alonso later tweeted: 'Green light to race. Thanks to @fia and @McLarenF1 for the work, professionalism and help on this last month. #ready.'

Williams driver Valtteri Bottas has also been passed fit to drive in Malaysia after undergoing his own medical checks by the FIA.

Bottas was forced to sit out Melbourne after sustaining a back injury during qualifying but following rest and rehabilitation, the Finn has been cleared to race.

A Williams statement read: 'Following the injury Valtteri sustained to his lower back during qualifying for the Australian GP, he has been with a leading physiotherapist who has been working with Valtteri and his trainer to make sure he received the best treatment possible ahead of this weekend's race.

'The team has always been fully supportive of Valtteri and his determination to return to the cockpit.

'Following final approval by the FIA medical team in Malaysia today (Thursday), we are pleased to confirm Valtteri will be back in the FW37 this weekend for the Malaysian Grand Prix.'

Soon after Bottas tweeted: 'Passed the medical tests and I've been given green light from @fia to race this weekend! Lets do it! #WeAreRacing #MalaysianGP #77.'
