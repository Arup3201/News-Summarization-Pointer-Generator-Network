The postage stamp-sized block went under the hammer for $6.34 million in the exclusive waterside Sydney suburb of Darling Point.

The narrow four-level property set on a small sandy beach between historic Carthona and Neidpath was sold to Dicker Data co-founder, Fiona Brown. 

The harbourside property, previously purchased by Melbourne-based landscaper Jack Merlo $6.15 million in 2009, came with $7.5 million plus hopes mid-last year but with no success.

It was then re-listed earlier this year through Pillinger Real Estate, inconjunction with Sothebys International, Property Obeserver reports.

The 207 square metre site dates back to the early 1980s when built by veteran property developer Bill Shipton.

The property is best known as the former home of Lady Susan Renouf, who sold it in 1997 for $2.9 million to Melbourne socialite Dianne Allen through the Double Bay agents Marcia Resch and Jane Ashton.

The house lay vacant when owned by absentee investor in the late 1980s, and nearby The Swifts' resident, Carl Spies - other than to be used by wealthy squatters for weekend raves.

The home was then elaborately restored by stylist Barry Byrne under the patronage of landlady Dorothy Spry who paid $2.4 million for the lavish  pad.

No waterfront property is ever complete without an inviting pristine swimming pool alongside the stunning view
