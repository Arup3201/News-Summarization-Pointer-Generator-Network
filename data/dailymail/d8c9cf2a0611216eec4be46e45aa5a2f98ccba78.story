A man armed with a 6in kitchen knife who was rugby-tackled to the ground by police outside Buckingham Palace after he attempted to see the Queen has painted many pictures of the Royal Family.

David Belmar, of Haringey, north London, admitted trespass and possession of a bladed article after he tried to run through the palace’s north centre gate just before 11.30am on Monday, a court heard yesterday.

When police searched Belmar after bringing him to the ground, they found the kitchen knife wrapped in a plastic bag in his jacket pocket.

The 44-year-old has posted a gallery of paintings, including portraits of the Queen, Kate Middleton, Prince Charles and Princess Anne.

Portraits of  the Duchess of Cambridge painted by Buckingham Palace intruder David Belmar

Belmar, who said he wanted to talk to the Queen about his benefits, painted her portrait and posted it online

David Belmar painted a series of portraits, including a pencil drawing of himself. He also painted the Mona Lisa and Piccadilly Circus

He has also included portraits of Piccadilly Circus, the Mona Lisa, Jesus Christ and self-portraits in his Facebook gallery, and posted a photograph of himself wearing a -shirt that says 'artist'. 

His simple paintings and pencil drawings also depict Barack Obama, Arnold Schwarzenegger and his mother.

The artist wanted to discuss his benefits with the Queen, a court heard.

Yesterday, Edward Aydin, prosecuting, told 
Westminster Magistrates’ Court in Central London: ‘In police custody, he
 said to police “I wanted to see the Queen. I’m not happy about my 
benefits”.’

David Belmar painted this picture of Jesus and a picture of himself. He also painted pictures of various celebrities and iconic landmarks

He added that 
Belmar, who has mental health issues, has a fixation with the Queen and 
received a caution in 1989 for lighting fireworks and throwing them into
 the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

The
 Queen was not in the building at the time of the incident, Buckingham 
Palace said. District Judge Quentin Purdy adjourned sentencing so that 
pre-sentence reports could be carried out.

He remanded Belmar in custody until he is sentenced at Southwark Crown Court at a date to be set.

Belmar,
 who appeared in court wearing a black jumper with an Umbro logo and 
blue jeans, went to the front of Buckingham Palace at 11.29am, Mr Aydin 
said.

He told the court Mr Belmar was seen to suddenly break into a run.

Arrest: The intruder sprinted in via its north gate (pictured guarded by police), which is open for cars, at around 11.30am

‘He
 then turned into the grounds of the palace and jumped over the vehicle 
barrier by putting his foot on that barrier,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘Two police
 officers, armed, one of them shouted: “Stop!” - he continued to run.

‘As
 you can see he’s quite a large man. He was rugby tackled to the ground 
because he wouldn’t stop. Police called out on two occasions.’

He
 added that other officers rushed to help apprehend Belmar. A number of 
children were at the gates of the palace watching while the incident was
 unfolding, the court heard.

‘Armed
 guards had to stop him,’ said Mr Aydin. ‘He could have been fired upon.
 Other people could have been hurt. And there was a risk of some form of
 disorder there outside the palace.’

Belmar
 was under the care of mental health services from 2002 to 2010 and 
lives with his father and brother, both of whom sat in the court’s 
public gallery for today’s hearing.

Mr Aydin said Belmar was a man with a long history of mental illness who is a danger to himself.

He
 added: ‘His behaviour that morning, yesterday, was unpredictable. He is
 a danger to the public, carrying a knife in central London, and he is a
 danger to the Queen.’

Robert Katz, defending, denied Belmar has a fixation with the Queen or Buckingham Palace, as it was claimed.

He
 said his client had been on incapacity benefit for the past 10 years 
but that it was stopped after he was assessed in September.

Mr Katz said: ‘He became very upset by that decision and he didn’t know how he was going to cope.’

He
 added that Belmar did not brandish the knife and was not going to use 
it, but that he had ‘wanted to draw publicity to what had happened to 
him’.

Belmar, who admitted 
trespass on a protected site and possession of a bladed or pointed 
article, has a number of previous convictions, including for actual 
bodily harm and criminal damage.

Mr Aydin told the court that Belmar becomes violent when taking some of his medication for mental health problems.

District Judge Purdy said the case was too serious to be dealt with in the magistrates’ court, given his past convictions.

Making
 his decision to remand Belmar in custody, he accepted he was living in 
the community on prescription medication but added: ‘Something has 
clearly gone wrong.

‘If it 
could go wrong yesterday, being granted bail there is a real risk, until
 he is properly assessed and perhaps further medication prescribed. He 
is a danger not just to himself but to others.’

Last
 month, a separate security incident was sparked at the palace when a 
suspected burglar got into the building by scaling a fence.

He
 was found at around 10.30pm on September 2 in a room that was open to 
the public during the day. A second man was arrested outside the palace 
on suspicion of conspiracy to commit burglary.

Less
 than 48 hours later, amid heightened security, two police officers 
confronted the Duke of York in the palace gardens demanding to know who 
he was.

Scotland Yard later 
issued a public apology to the Duke, and in response he issued a 
statement saying protection officers have ‘a difficult job’ and he was 
grateful that the force had apologised.
