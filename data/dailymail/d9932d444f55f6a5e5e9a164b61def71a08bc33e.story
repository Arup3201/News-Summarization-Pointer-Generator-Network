A devoted dog has proved its unfailing love for its master after it raced after an ambulance which was taking him to hospital.

Desperate not to lose sight of the vehicle, the pet was  filmed bounding along in the middle of the road in the driver's wing mirror by an astounded paramedic in Goiana, Brazil.

The recording, released on the weekend, then switches to the passenger's side and captures the adorable creature bounding beside the vehicle for several minutes in its determination to keep up.

Man's best friend: Astounded paramedics filmed this devoted dog keeping up with its owner - as he was taken to hospital at high speed in an ambulance. Eventually the crew in Goiana, Brazil, let him aboard

Exhausted: At one stage the dog crossed  to the pavement, beginning to fall behind as it ran out of breath

At one stage the dog starts to fall behind as it begins to run out of breath, but keeping close to the side of the ambulance, the pet looks up appealingly at the crew as if pleading for help.

Realising the long journey to the general hospital will be too much for the animal, the ambulance crew eventually decide to stop the vehicle and let the 'man's best friend' climb on board.

Paramedic Celiomar Ferreira do Couto, 42, who made the video, said the whole service team was touched by the love shown by the dog for its owner, a homeless man.

'I've been doing this job for 19 years and I've never seen anything like it,' said Mr Couto.

'Sometimes we arrive at the scene of an emergency and there are pets around but they are too shy for us to get close to and they often run way. I have never seen this reaction in all my career.'

Reinvigorated: The dog ran alongside the ambulance between it and the pavement, to the crew's amazement

Commenting in the video, Mr Couto says to his colleague as he watches the dog chase the ambulance – 'doesn't he get tired?'

Then to the dog he shouts – 'Go home. Go and have a rest, give up.'  

On board, the faithful companion won praise for its good behaviour. The crew allowed it to sit next to the owner in the ambulance all the way to the hospital.

'We couldn't believe how well-behaved the dog was,' he added. 'It just sat quietly and patiently beside its owner. It didn't even bark.

'The man was in and out of consciousness but he could see his companion was right there with him on the way'.

Once at the hospital, the owner, who had suffered an epileptic seizure, was placed on a stretcher. 

Let me on board! The pet looks imploringly up at the ambulance's crew, one of whom filmed the scene

Faithful: The dog next to its owner on a stretcher in hospital. The outcome of his treatment is unknown

The affectionate pet was again filmed hovering close by, eventually settling down patiently to stay beside the bedside.

The hospital has not been able to comment on the outcome of the man's hospital stay and whether he recovered to leave with his pet.

'Unfortunately, I wasn't able to find out what happened to the pet and its owner, but it has certainly given me faith in the loyalty and love that exists between owners and their dogs,' said Mr Couto.
