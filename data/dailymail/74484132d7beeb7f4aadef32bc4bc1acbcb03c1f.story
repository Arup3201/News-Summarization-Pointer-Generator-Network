A woman, her children, and her mother were returning from a family gathering when their car veered off a Long Island highway, crashed into a tree and burst into flames, killing all of them, authorities said Sunday.

Myriam Lebrun, 37, was en route to Brooklyn and traveling on the Southern State Parkway just before 11 p.m. Saturday when her Honda Accord left the westbound lanes near Exit 38 in Babylon, state police told the Associated Press.

'There was a heavy fire condition to the front of the vehicle and (to) the passengerâ€™s side,' Robert Cabano, North Babylon's First Assistant Fire Chief, told The New York Daily News.

Cabano told the newspaper the incident was 'absolutely tragic.'

State police told the Associated Press it was unclear why the car veered off the road. The cause of the crash remains under investigation.

The crash shut down the area of the road for several hours.
