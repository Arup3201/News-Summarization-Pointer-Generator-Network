An orphaned sea otter found all alone on a California beach four weeks ago has finally found a new home.

The pup was discovered on Coastways Beach in central California by a jogger four weeks ago, and immediately taken to the Monterey Bay Aquarium for care.

The southern sea otter was  severely underweight and had been abandoned by her mother at least 16 hours prior to being discovered workers there said, so it was immediately a rush to get her fed and healthy.

Workers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium spent four weeks getting the pup healthy again

Now, after four weeks of intensive care and stabilization in Monterey Bay's Sea Otter Program, the now 5-week-old pup, whose name is currently Pup 681, is ready to head to its new home - in Chicago. 

Monterey Bay Aquarium reached out to aquariums ain search of a facility that could provide necessary care for the pup, and the Shedd Aquarium in the Windy City answered their call.

'It truly takes a village to rehabilitate a young sea otter,' Tim Binder, the aquarium's vice president, told the Chicago Tribune.

'Our animal care team is teaching the pup how to be an otter.'

She spends her days swimming, playing with felt and drinking formula filled with minced clams

And Pup 681 seems to love her new surroundings, swimming around, playing with felt and enjoying meals of formula with minced clams.

She is also learning how to feed and bathe herself.

Best of all however, staff at the aquarium is hard at work picking out a name for the new lady in their lives.
