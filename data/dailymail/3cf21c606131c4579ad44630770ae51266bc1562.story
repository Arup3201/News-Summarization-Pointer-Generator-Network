Wading through mountains of cans, bottles, televisions and computers, these are the migrant labourers forced to live and work in a Chinese rubbish tip.

As the country's population boom shows no sign of abating and its rampant consumerism continues unchecked, China has established itself as the world's biggest generator of solid waste. 

Much of the rubbish created in Beijing is transported to the rubbish tip in Dong Xiao Kou, near Beijing, where a large community lives and thrives on salvaging what they can from the vast amount of waste.

At Dong Xiao Kou, also known as China's 'scrap village', labourers have become a critical part of the waste management system.

Mostly consisting of migrant families, the labouring crews have flocked to the village from the surrounding provinces where they earn a living sorting through the waste and recycled goods.

The work is often dirty and dangerous. Electronic waste, such as televisions, cameras, computers and cellphones carry unique hazards for those handling them.

They contain metals and various chemical compounds - such as mercury, cadmium and chromium - that can pose a serious risk to people who come into repeated contact with them.

While some chance their luck with electronics, other members of the community have branched out to specialise in recycling wood, cardboard or plastics.

The village is mostly made up of poor migrant workers from the surrounding provinces. Pictured are dozens of televisions and computers

China is the world's biggest generator of solid waste and labourers who salvage the goods have become a crucial part of the country's waste management system. Here, a man poses for a photo on the back of a truck loaded with discarded fridges and washing machines

There are believed to be tens of thousands of scrap sorters working at various rubbish tips throughout China
