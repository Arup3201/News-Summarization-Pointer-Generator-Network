The girlfriend of a 22-year-old man who died after being hit by a train following a fight at a railway station has described him as her 'best friend and soulmate'.

Ryan Harrison, who was with a male friend at the time, is believed to have been involved in a confrontation with a group of men at Guildford station in Surrey on March 30.

Shortly afterwards, he was fatally injured when he fell into the gap between a train and the platform as the train began to pull away.

Three 19-year-old men, two from Guildford and a third from Cranleigh, were arrested on suspicion of murder and released on bail.

Mr
Harrison's girlfriend, Jaime-Leigh Egerton, 20, from Mayford, said in a
statement released through British Transport Police: 'I haven't just 
lost my beloved boyfriend, I've lost my best friend and my soulmate.

'Ryan was a unique man with so many special qualities, you just couldn't help but love the person he was.

'He made every day together a blessing, he inspired me to do better and to be better.

'He had the biggest, kindest heart with the cheekiest smile.

'We were destined for each other and taught each other about true love.

'I will never stop loving you, baby. I'm just so sorry we couldn't have done everything we planned to do together.

'You will forever keep living in my heart until the day it stops beating.

'Thank you so much for everything and loving me for me. Forever yours. I love you.'

Earlier this month, Mr Harrison’s family said: 'Ryan was the biggest, brightest ray of sunshine for us. He loved life, his family and his friends.'

'He was a brother, son and boyfriend - we were so lucky to have him in our lives.

'He always looked so smart and gorgeous. He was ambitious in life and loved to party. He was a true sun worshipper and always had to have a tan.

'His family have been totally devastated by his loss, and we ask to be left in peace and given time to grieve.

'We would like to thank everyone for their kind words and tributes - we take strength from seeing how much he was loved by everyone that knew him.

'He had the biggest, kindest heart, and a bright light has been turned off in all of us that knew and loved him.

'Rest in peace Ryan, sleep tight our darling.'

Officers are continuing to investigate the circumstances surrounding the death and are examining CCTV footage.

A family friend said Mr Harrison, of 
Woking, Surrey, had moved with his father to Spain to start a business 
but came back in September last year.

Daloney Carlton, partner of Mr 
Harrison’s father Tony, said: ‘He came back in September because he 
missed his friends and moved in with his girlfriend.

‘I don’t know what happened but I think he was with his girlfriend at the station.

‘He was a lovely lad and his father is in pieces. He is flying back in a couple of days but can’t even talk at the moment.’

British Transport Police are looking for witnesses to the crime

Friends posted tributes on social networking sites as news of the tragedy spread.

Ryan's pal Adam Wicks wrote on Facebook: 'Words cant even explain what you ment to me Ryan Harrison i'll miss you so much, truly lost a brother. nothing will even be the same now. love you and sleep tight xxxx'.Daniel Cooper added: 'Heart goes to the family an close friends of Ryan Harrison. Taken at such a young age. R.I.P my man. xx'.

Others laid floral tributes and touching handwritten notes at the station where Ryan died.

One note, signed by 'Charlie', said: "Ryan, I can't get my head around that you've gone.

'I keep thinking you'll call any minute and come out with something stupid like you usually do!

'You have been an amazing best friend to me and I will miss you dearly.

'We are all trying to stick together and help one another through.

'I promise to look after your little 'flee' [sic] Jaime Leigh. You were a brother to me.

'I've had to say goodbye to you so many times when you've gone to Zante, Spain etc.

'But what did we say instead to stop me crying? "This isn't goodbye, it's I'll see you soon."

'So for now, my darling, sleep tight and I will see you soon.

'Love you forever and always, your little Charlie xxxxxxx'.

Detective Chief Inspector Iain Miller,
senior investigating officer, said: 'Our thoughts remain with Ryan’s 
family as they try to come to terms with what happened. This is clearly a
very painful and difficult time for them.

'The station was cordoned off until 
the early hours of Sunday morning while forensic officers conducted a 
thorough search and my team of detectives are working to establish the 
full circumstances surrounding Ryan’s death, which we are currently 
treating as suspicious.

'Ryan’s family will have many 
questions about the circumstances leading up to his death. We are 
working to piece together the full picture of events and will do 
everything we can to establish exactly what took place on Saturday 
night.

'We’re making local inquiries, 
including speaking to people in the area and trawling through hours of 
CCTV footage, but we also know there were a number of other people at 
the station at the time.

'If you were there and haven’t yet come forward, please get in touch.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
