Jenson Button is bracing himself for an emotional farewell at the McLaren factory if he eventually learns the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was his last race in Formula One.

Button finished his 15th campaign in Formula One on a relative high with a fifth-place finish at the Yas Marina circuit.

Post-race, though, Button experienced a range of bizarre feelings as McLaren Group chief executive Ron Dennis has still yet to make a call as to who will partner Fernando Alonso on the Spaniard's return in 2015.

No decision is to be made until early December, leaving Button in limbo for potentially up to another fortnight.

If Dennis does call time on his 266-race career, Button knows he will have to make one last trip to Woking to sign off in fitting fashion.

'Yes, I will definitely go back,' said Button.

'It will be quite emotional, but definitely it will be the right thing to do.

'They have been my racing family for the past five years and it would be wrong to just walk away from that.'

Conceding to ups and downs throughout his time in F1, with the peak winning the 2009 world title, Button has again reiterated he has no desire to leave just yet.

'You could say it's been a pretty good 15 years,' added Button.

'I think any driver would be happy to retire now, but you can see on the circuit what makes championships and careers and I'm totally not ready to walk away.

'I've always given 100 per cent, and sometimes it doesn't work out for you.

'But I'm not interested in getting in any type of racing car and risking my life and not giving 100 per cent.'
