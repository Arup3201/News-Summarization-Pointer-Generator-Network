A trainee lawyer has racked up £350,000 in legal bills pursuing damages after being injured by a sun lounger on a luxury cruise ship.

Now Shantelle Taylor, 22, is pleading with senior judges to save her from financial ruin after her eight-year battle with P&O.

She was aged 14 during the £20,000 Caribbean cruise on the liner Aurora when she claimed a sun lounger was caught by a gust of wind and flew into her.

Miss Taylor sued the company after returning home from the trip with her grandparents and mother Nichola, 40.

At first it was thought she had 
escaped with only a soft tissue injury but her family claims that her 
life has been blighted since by crippling chronic pain syndrome.

Earlier in the court saga that has lasted since 2004, P&O admitted liability and offered her £2,000 to settle the claim.

Miss Taylor, of Droylesden, Manchester, turned this down and went on to seek substantial damages.

Her fortunes reversed in 2008 when a 
judge allowed P&O to withdraw its admission after fresh evidence 
about weather conditions on the day of the accident.

The judge ruled that her damages claim had ‘no reasonable prospect of success’ after the testimony of a wind speed expert.

Miss Taylor has run out of funds to 
pay lawyers but fought on with the help of her grandfather Derek Wilde, 
74, and his wife Christine, 65.

Despite having no legal training, Mr Wilde appeared at the Appeal Court in London to plead her case.

He asked Mr Justice Peter Smith to resurrect Miss Taylor’s claim and spare her the mammoth costs bill.

The judge warned Mr Wilde: ‘If you 
lose this case, they’ll probably make your granddaughter bankrupt. You 
are out of your depth.’

Mr Wilde continued, telling him: ‘It 
is important we win for Shantelle because she is studying to become a 
solicitor and we don’t want her to have a black mark against her.’

He asked the judge to send his 
granddaughter’s damages claim back for re-hearing and to look again at 
the huge bill for legal costs.

Mr Wilde pleaded: ‘It is so unfair when it is not her fault.’

He told how the family set off on 
their dream holiday for three weeks over Christmas 2003 and New Year 
2004, taking in 18 countries.

The accident with the 
sun lounger happened on the 12th or 13th deck of the liner as it lay off 
the coast of Tortola in the British Virgin Islands in early 2004, said 
Mr Wilde.

The judge ruled that Miss Taylor’s damages claim could not be 
revived but he did grant an adjournment.

He said this would allow Mr Wilde to seek legal advice and obtain documents relating to the costs, £7,500 of which falls on him.

The judge said: ‘It is  important that Mr Wilde has a fair chance to prove his case on behalf of his granddaughter.’

Outside court, Mrs Wilde said the cruise should have been ‘the holiday of a lifetime’.

She said her granddaughter had been 
left in ‘excruciating pain’ but added: ‘She is studying to be a 
solicitor and she’s doing very well.’

A P&O Cruises spokesman said: 'Mr Wilde, on behalf of his granddaughter, has pursued this spurious case over many years despite warnings that he would be liable for his costs when he lost. 

'The Court of Appeal decided that the evidence showed that the accident could not possibly have occurred in any of the various ways alleged.  The Court therefore refused Mr Wilde permission to continue with the case to trial. 

'P&O Cruises has incurred over £200,000 in lawyers costs defending this claim, which the Court found Mr Wilde and Shantelle Taylor were liable to pay.  P&O Cruises can confirm it has not threatened to make Miss Taylor bankrupt.'
