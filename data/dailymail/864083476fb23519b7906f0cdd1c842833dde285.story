American children aren't the fattest in the world any longer - that distinction belongs to Greece and Italy.

A new report from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development ranks kids in the United States fifth - after the two Mediterranean countries, New Zealand and Slovenia.

About 30percent of American children age 5 to 17 are overweight or obese, compared with 44percent of boys and 38percent of girls in Greece. In Italy, the rate is 36percent for boys and 34percent for girls.

Greece in the lead: The United States has the fourth-most obese children in the world - not the first - according to a new OECD report

The United States is still well ahead of the pack in terms of childhood obesity. The average rate for the 34 nations in the OECD is 23percent for boys and 21percent for girls.

England is below-average for boys, 22percent, but above average for girls, 26percent.

The new OECD report blames the rise in childhood obesity in Italy, Greece and Slovenia Europe's financial crisis.

All three nations were forced to reign in government spending - which led household budgets to fall. With less money for groceries, families opted for less healthy foods - more pre-packaged meals and fewer fruits and vegetables.

During the 2008-2009 economic downturn, families in Britain, for example, decreased their food spending by 8.5percent, which increased their caloric intake by 4.5percent - adding more sugars and saturated fat to their diets.

Still the biggest of the bunch: The USA still has the highest obesity rate in the world - though the rate has stopped increasing in recent years

For overall obesity rates, however, Americans are still the biggest of the bunch. In 2012, 35percent of US citizens were obese - nearly twice the OECD average of 18.4percent.

The United Kingdom came in eighth with 24.7percent. The adult obesity rates for Greece and Italy are much lower - 19.6percent and 10.4percent, respectively.

Overall, obesity rates in the U.S. has stopped growing in recent years, a small consolation for the fattest country in the world.

Between 2008 and 2012, the obesity rate actually decreased slightly after skyrocketing since the 1970s.
