Watford are lining up Chris Hughton as their next manager following Giuseppe Sannino’s resignation.

Former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia is the favourite for Watford job but Sportsmail understands the Hornets have identified Hughton as their top target to succeed the Sannino, who called time on his nine-month spell at Vicarage Road on Sunday night.

Former Newcastle boss Hughton has been out of work since parting company with Norwich in April after a poor run of results that eventually saw the Canaries relegated from the Premier League.

In the frame: Chris Hughton has been linked with the vacant managerial position at Watford 

On the way out: Giuseppe Sannino tendered his resignation despite Watford's excellent start to the season

But now Watford see the 55-year-old as the man to continue their strong start in the Championship that has seen them pick up 12 points from their opening five matches.

And the new manager could be in place at Vicarage Road in time for Saturday’s trip to Watford.

Hughton had been linked with the Crystal Palace job in recent weeks but eventually lost out to returning boss Neil Warnock while Fulham have also been linked as potential suitors if Felix Magath loses his job.
