British company Rolls-Royce has been accused of being involved in a multi-billion-dollar bribery scheme engulfing Brazil's state-owned oil producer.

The engineering firm, a supplier of gas turbines for Petrobras oil platforms, allegedly paid bribes via an agent in exchange for a $100million (£65m) contract.

Rolls-Royce said it had not received details of the allegations from the authorities, but added that it 'did not tolerate improper business conduct'.

Allegations: British company Rolls-Royce has been accused of being involved in a multi-billion-dollar bribery scheme that is engulfing Brazil's state-owned oil producer Petrobras

Claims: The engineering firm, a supplier of gas turbines for Petrobras oil platforms like the one pictured, allegedly paid bribes in exchange for a $100million (£65m) contract

The company was named in court documents by former Petrobras executive Pedro Barusco who told police he personally received $200,000 (£135,000) from Rolls-Royce.

He claims bribes were also paid to a ring of politicians and other bosses at the oil giant, it was reported by the Financial Times, which cited documents released by Brazil's federal court system.

Petrobras is engulfed in a widening corruption scandal, in which billions of dollars were allegedly paid by companies in bribes to win contracts from the Brazilian firm. 

A spokesman for Rolls-Royce told MailOnline: 'We have not received details of the allegations made in recent press reports, nor have we been approached by the authorities in Brazil.

'We have always been clear that we will not tolerate improper business conduct of any sort and will take all necessary action to ensure compliance, including co-operating with authorities in any country.' 

Rolls-Royce responded to the allegations by saying that it did not tolerate improper business conduct

Shares in Rolls-Royce were down 1.1 per cent at 934.8 pence by 9.12am GMT, lagging Britain's bluechip index which was down 0.1 per cent. 

The company, the world's second-largest maker of aircraft engines, is also under investigation by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) into concerns of possible bribery and corruption in China and Indonesia, in a probe which dates back to 2012. 

Meanwhile, mounting allegations that Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff's party received hundreds of millions of dollars in the  scandal engulfing Petrobras have sent her poll ratings tumbling.

Rousseff only embarked on a second term in office last month, having succeeded popular Workers Party (PT) predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 2011.
