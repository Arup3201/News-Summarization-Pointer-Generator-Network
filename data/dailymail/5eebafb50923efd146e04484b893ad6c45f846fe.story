A council that spent £26,000 pounds on concrete flower pots plans to remove them after drunk locals used them as urinals and ash trays.

Portsmouth City Council is being forced to re-think its decision to put the seven planters in the pedestrianised zone in Southsea, Hampshire, in light of the anti-social behavior.

But local residents who branded them a 'waste of money' that should never have been put in place are happy to see the flower pots go.

The flower pots on Palmerston Road cost the council £26,000 but have been used by drunk revellers as urinals and ash trays

Linda Symes, whose anti-pedestrianisation petition attracted 1,400 signatures, said: 'The concrete planters are being used as a receptacle for cigarette ends and are being used by people to go to the toilet and be sick in.

'The council could have put trees there instead and that would have given the place a nicer feel.

'We are having to close things down and reduce services in the city, yet money can be thrown away like this all because the council didn’t think to do its homework.

'If it had, it would have realised putting planters in there would have been a terrible error.'

Another resident complained that the council's latest proposals are having a negative effect on local business.

Marion Wren, owner of Preloved Portsmouth clothes shop 
said: 'I want the high street opened up.

'The planters could be replaced 
with some parking spaces.

Local business owners would be happy to see the flower pots go, with some suggesting they should be replaced with trees or parking spaces

The road used to be buzzing but it’s now a ghost town.'

The removal of the plant pots comes after £9,000 was spent building bollards on a nearby road to stop lorries from using it.

But,
three months later, the bungling council was forced to tear them down 
when the local fire service warned their engines could not get past.

Portsmouth South MP, Mike Hancock says it was more important that the council got things right, adding any plans for the flower pots to be used to improve another road in the city should be reconsidered.

 'It seems we have to rethink the whole idea of what we are going to do.

'If we have done something and we genuinely appreciate that it’s a mistake, that problems are being caused, and the quality of the setting is being affected, then the best way forward would be to take the planters out.

'People thought the planters would improve Palmerston Road, but they have turned out to be a focal point for problems.

'We have to make sure the same mistake isn’t made in Osborne Road.'
