Joe Preston died from a suspected ecstasy overdose after he collapsed following a night out with friend

A former grammar school pupil died from a suspected ecstasy overdose after he collapsed following a night out with friends.

Joe Preston, 17, had been celebrating his friend's 18th birthday at a dance music event in Leeds, West Yorkshire before he collapsed at the home of a fellow reveller.

His friends called 999 and attempted CPR on the carpentry student, and although he was rushed to hospital he died shortly after his arrival at Bradford Royal infirmary - just before his worried family arrived to see him.

Police believe Joe, from Ilkley, Yorkshire, became ill after consuming alcohol and ecstasy during his night out on Saturday.

Joe's family were told of his collapse by the hospital at 8.30am on Sunday, but by the time they arrived 30 minutes later he had died.

Today, Joe's parents and brothers described him as a quiet, shy boy who was passionate about pursuing a career as a joiner, but tragically paid the ultimate price for taking drugs.

Speaking at the family home, grieving father Ed said lessons should be learned from his youngest son's death.

'It’s not about just getting the message across to kids but also about getting the message across to parents,' said the design engineer

'As parents we are all concerned. The message is that parents need to set up some early warning network for anything new they hear about.

'It’s all well setting up these education programmes for kids like "just say no", but saying no to a 16 or 17-year-old is like a red rag to a bull.

'They need to be informed what these drugs are, what the different strengths are and what is coming in.

'Joe had his whole life ahead of him and was lucky in that he would have had the support to fulfil his ambitions, but all that’s gone now.

'Joe’s gone now, we can’t bring him back. I just hope it’s a lesson for his friends.'

The 54-year-old called for more detailed drugs information to be freely available for both children and parents.

'Lots of kids do it and he was just unlucky. He made a mistake and he’s paid for it,' said Mr Preston.

'We talked to Joe, but there’s only so much you can say and that they’ll listen to.

'They’ll more likely listen to their friends, but nobody made Joe take it - it was his choice and he’s paid the price.'

Joe's mother Viv, 50, said: 'Don’t think it can’t happen to you.

'We want to hide away from it but we can’t because we have to go on somehow.

'It’s more important to try and get the message you want out, you can’t bury your head in the sand.'

Joe, a former pupil at Ilkley Grammar School, was in his second year of a college course in carpentry and joinery. It was a course he loved and one he hoped would lead to a career.

'He was doing really well. It was all coming together,' said Mrs Preston.

'He seemed happy.

'It only takes one dodgy pill, one chemical in it, they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it’s bad'

James Preston, Joe's brother

'His friends were everything to him. He was a really loyal, caring friend - he’d put his friends first all the time.

'He was a quiet lad with a wicked sense of humour, like his dad.'

Mrs Preston, an administration worker at Airedale Hospital, said she hoped other teenagers would think about what her family was going through following Joe's death.

Joe lived on a leafy street in the Ben Rhydding area of Ilkley with his parents and his brother Ollie, 19. His other brother James, 21, lives in Manchester.

James said: 'People could do it all the time but it only takes one dodgy pill, one chemical in it, they could take it hundreds of times and then it would be that one time it’s bad.'

Ollie added: 'People should be given realistic advice. People just don’t know, they see a pill that has a picture on it or is a certain colour and they think they know what they are getting.'

'This is a small community and the people he knows will likely take more notice. If it means they think or stop and not take drugs, that will be a positive thing.

'If people can just stop and try to imagine what we’re going through now - a kid won’t want their parents to go through what we’re going through. The message is simple, just think.'

Police said a post-mortem examination proved to be inconclusive and further tests will now be carried out to establish the cause of Joe's death.

Two 18-year-old men, who were arrested on suspicion of supplying controlled drugs, have been released on bail.

An inquest into Joe’s death is expected to open later this week.
