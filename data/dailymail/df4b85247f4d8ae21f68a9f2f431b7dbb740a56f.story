A teenager charged with stabbing 20 students and a security guard at his high school was motivated by the Columbine massacre, according to an expert witness today.

Psychologist Bruce Chambers, who was hired by the defense team, testified on Friday that 16-year-old Alex Hribal  planned the stabbing for April 20, the 15th anniversary of the massacre, but school was out that day.

Instead, Chambers said, the youth brought two 8-inch kitchen knives to Franklin Regional High School in Pennsylvania on April 9, the birthday of Eric Harris, one of the two Columbine shooters.

Alex Hribal was led out by sheriffs after being placed under arrest for going on a stabbing spree at his Pennsylvania high school on April 9 - a day he allegedly picked as an homage to Columbine shooter Eric Harris as it was his birthday

The hearing will determine whether Hribal will be moved from a juvenile detention center to a mental health facility.

His lawyer has acknowledged Hribal committed the crimes but said questions remain about his ability to recognize the seriousness and wrongfulness of his actions.

The attack occurred minutes before the start of classes at Franklin Regional High School on April 9.

Hribal is charged with 21 counts of attempted homicide and aggravated assault and one count of possessing weapons on school property. 

Students at Franklin Regional High School were evacuated after the stabbing on April 9 which left 20 students and security guard injured

His attorney, Patrick Thomassey, doesn't dispute that Hribal brought two eight-inch kitchen knives from his home and attacked others before classes began that morning.

But Thomassey maintains the boy has deep-seated mental health issues that would be better addressed in juvenile court.

Thomassey has said he plans to ask a judge to move the case from Common Pleas to juvenile court, where the judge would be able to incarcerate or supervise Hribal only until he's 21.

If he's convicted as an adult, he would likely face decades in prison. Prosecutors are expected to argue that Hribal should continue to be treated as an adult.

Hribal's trial had been scheduled to begin October 6, but was postponed indefinitely to resolve some legal issues. 

During the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, Dylan Klebold and fellow senior student Eric Harris killed 12 students and one teacher and injured 26 others  before taking their own lives.

The large-scale attack also involved a fire bomb used to distract fire fighters. 

At the time, it was the worst school shooting in the country's history before in 2012, shooter Adam Lanzo killed 20 students and six teaching staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut.

Because school was out that day, he then picked April 9 'because it was the birthday of Columbine shooter Eric Harris'
