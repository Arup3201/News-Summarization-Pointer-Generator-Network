A British holidaymaker claims he 'could have been killed' after a mechanical error while he was riding one of the world's tallest waterslides.

Jamie Norman, 27, was left with his severe injuries to his face, legs and arms, alleging that the 60mph VertiGo slide in Aqualandia, Benidorm, Spain, malfunctioned.

Thrill-seekers stand in a capsule 110ft in the air - then a trapdoor opens and they plummet down a steep slide into the water.

But the trapdoor failed to open all the way on Jamie's third go, causing agonising injuries to his legs, arms and face as he dropped.

Father-of-two Jamie, an electrician, said: 'I could have been killed. If I'd been knocked unconscious I could have lost control and fallen and drowned in the pool. I took an almighty crack on my face.'

He claims the pool below 'full of blood'.

The father-of-two told the Sunday Mirror: 'As I fell, I felt it scrape all down my legs and arms and then smack into my face.'

He said despite being 'quite distressed', he was told by the park's staff, 'We'll sew you up', and was treated by an on-site doctor - 'they didn't bother calling an ambulance'.

Jamie claims the waterslide was reopened 10 minutes later even though he told them it wasn't safe to ride.

And he says he was offered free tickets to the zoo by way of an apology as he was 'ushered to the exit'.

A spokesman for Aqualandia said 'exhaustive daily checks' are made on the park's equipment

Jamie added: 'It seemed like they were more interested in getting us out of the place so we didn’t cause too much of a fuss, I was in such a daze I went along with it.'

Recovering back home in Radcliffe, Jamie added: 'I'm still in a lot of pain. I should be at home resting with my feet up but I have a family and a mortgage to pay so I'm having to go back to work.'

'Now I want to warn people these places aren’t safe.'

He is now suing the owners of the water park, Aqualandia.

A spokesman for Aqualandia said: 'We make exhaustive checks on all our equipment daily. We would never open – or reopen – a ride that wasn’t safe.'
