South Yorkshire Police, Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield City Council and the Football Association could all be charged with manslaughter, 24 years after the Hillsborough tragedy happened.

All four organisation are being investigated for possible for possible gross negligence manslaughter over the disaster at the stadium in Sheffield on April 15 1989.

The disclosure was made by Jon Stoddart, former chief constable of the Durham force, who is leading the new investigation called 'Operation Resolve' into the tragedy.

Horror: Fans try to get away from the crush of the crowd as they pour into the ground

Fans were badly injured in the 1989 match, and one was carried on an advertising board used as a stretcher. The disaster is now at the centre of the biggest ever inquiry into police conduct in the UK

He told the Guardian newspaper: 'We are exploring all 
liability, both public and individual. We are looking at unlawful 
killing; who is responsible for the deaths.'

He said more was being looked at than command and control of the crowd, including an investigation into the logistics and planning around the game beforehand.

He said: 'It
is about the safety of the stadium, certification, the planning and 
preparation, the engineering and design that went into the Leppings Lane
end (where the people died),' the Guardian reported.

Sheffield Wednesday football club offered to host the match despite serial breaches of the Home 
Office guide to ground safety and a safety certificate 10 years out of 
date, the newspaper reported.

Sheffield city council was statutorily responsible 
for licensing the stadium as safe, and the FA commissioned the ground 
for the FA Cup semi final despite Hillsborough's safety breaches and 
previous crushes at semi finals there in 1981, 1987 and 1988.

Supporters were crushed against the barrier in the disastrous match. four organisations are being investigated for possible gross negligence manslaughter

A FA spokesman said: 'The FA maintains their stance that since the inquiry was announced it will co-operate fully with the investigation.'

A Sheffield City Council spokesman said: 'Sheffield City Council is committed to fully cooperating with the Stoddart enquiry.

'It would be inappropriate to comment about the likelihood or otherwise of prosecution at this stage.

'We are trusting to the processes (including the new inquests) and are fully engaged with them.'

Sheffield Wednesday Football Club declined to comment and South Yorkshire Police has been contacted by the Mail Online for a response.

Meanwhile,
it has emerged that more than 90 police pocket notebooks that could 
contain crucial new information about the disaster have been recovered 
by investigators.

The 
Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), which revealed last 
month that it was looking for the notebooks, said 90 had been handed in 
to South Yorkshire Police by retired and serving officers.

The
force has also found boxes of notebooks and other documents that cover 
the period of the disaster, which could contain vital details.

Deputy
chairwoman of the IPCC, Deborah Glass said: 'This is an ongoing 
criminal investigation the like of which has never been seen before in 
this country. Already we are uncovering more about the disaster and its 
aftermath.

'Hillsborough has
had a history of inquiries by the police and others, many completed 
quickly, coming to flawed conclusions. Our investigations need to 
deliver the last, definitive account.'

Last
month the IPCC revealed that at least at one officer made a note of 
what happened that day, against instructions, and that none of the 
previous inquiries into the tragedy had recovered any such notebooks.

The disaster is now at the centre of the biggest ever inquiry into police conduct in the UK.

The
IPCC said it has uncovered evidence to suggest that the statements of 
74 more officers might have been changed, and that fans' witness 
accounts could also have been altered.

Investigators
are set to appeal for witnesses next week in relation to how West 
Midlands Police ran their inquiry into the handling of the disaster by 
South Yorkshire Police.

Around 12,000 people spoke to West Midlands Police during the inquiry.
