With his ID in hand, the cherub-faced Matt Fitzpatrick will bid farewell to the amateur ranks at the 114th United States Open at Pinehurst this week and join the hard-nosed world of the professional game.

No wonder they say looks can deceive. Standing next to the defending champion Justin Rose and the much-decorated Phil Mickelson on Thursday, it would be easy to think he is about to get eaten alive.

But it’s less than two months since the Sheffield teenager finished in the top 25 at a PGA Tour event and that’s more than Tiger Woods managed at the same age. At the season’s first major, he sucked up a chastening double bogey at the first hole and missed out on the weekend at the Masters by a single stroke.

It was after those events that Fitzpatrick, 19, came to his life-changing decision. ‘At the Heritage tournament on Hilton Head Island I should have been at least six shots lower and that was down to experience,’ he said.

‘I know every player thinks they should score better but  everyone around me watching was thinking the same thing, that I really should have been a lot closer to the lead.’ 

Six shots lower and Fitzpatrick would have been joint second alongside Luke Donald. ‘That  experience and the Masters told me what many of the pros had been telling me — that I was ready to join them,’ he said. ‘Until then I wasn’t sure. But, without sounding big-headed, what’s left for me to achieve in the amateur world? My game is ready. I just need that experience.’

So to Pinehurst and Fitzpatrick knows the words that will greet him as he prepares to enter the locker room: ‘ID, please.’ It was that way at The Open at Muirfield last year when he won the silver medal for low amateur and has remained that way since.

‘I’ve just got used to showing my ID every time I turn up for a tournament,’ he says, smiling. ‘You watch Rory (McIlroy) head towards the locker room and the other players and they have that presence and get waved through without any questions asked. But I definitely don’t have that.’

He will acquire it quickly enough, of course, if all goes to plan following his professional debut at the Irish Open next week.

Not that his friends would ever allow him to get carried away. ‘They start yelling BBT (Becoming Big Time) if someone asks for an autograph,’ he said. ‘How would I cope with fame? I’d definitely stay grounded with the mates I’ve got, and my dad in particular. If you look at the likes of Adam Scott, who is probably the nicest golfer I’ve met at any level of the game and he’s the world No 1, it shows it can be done.’

Scott showed his class at Augusta when he walked from the first green to the second tee with  Fitzpatrick after that ugly six for openers.  ‘He was a big help and so were other players like G-Mac (Graeme McDowell) and Lee (Westwood),’ says Fitzpatrick.

‘I’m excited about what lies ahead. It’s my first proper job and it’s a massive step up from babysitting my brother and getting £20!’

Fitzpatrick need only look over at one of his playing partners at Pinehurst to know there are no guarantees. Rose, of course, went from finishing fourth at The Open as a 17-year-old amateur to missing 21 halfway cuts in a row.

All change: Fitzpatrick's only previous job was as a babysitter for his younger brother

‘I played a practice round with him at Augusta and we talked about that,’ said Fitzpatrick. ‘It just shows it’s a big jump from the amateur game and the standard is dauntingly high. So my goal is just to try to make the cut in each event I’m playing and take it from there.’

‘If I wasn’t excited I should be thinking about another career. I want to play in majors and in front of big crowds. The Open last year and the Masters were fantastic experiences and I think I showed I can play.’

Making the cut and earning one final silver medal for low amateur would wrap up the first phase of his career nicely. Then it’s on to the real world, where Fitzpatrick is ready to grow up quickly.

Even if he does look like he should still be babysitting.
