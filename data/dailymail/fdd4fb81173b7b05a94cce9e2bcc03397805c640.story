Following Portugal's dramatic 2-2 with USA on Monday night, both teams must win their final group game to stand any chance of progressing to the last 16 of the World Cup.

Media from both nations have focused on the enthralling tie in which Portugal equalised in the fifth minute of injury time to give themselves a lifeline and damage the hopes of the U.S.

Diario de Noticias have gone with an image of star man Cristiano Ronaldo with his hand on his head after the draw leaves the Portuguese of crashing out of the tournament at the group stage phase.

Journal de Noticias also use Ronaldo sat on the pitch looking dejected at the full-time whistle and accompany the image with the headline: 'Do the maths' as Portugal are now relying on other results to go their way.

Meanwhile, New York's 'Hometown Newspaper' Daily News used an image of Silvestre Varela's late goal as goalkeeper Tim Howard looks on as the headline reads: 'Heartbreak header!' following the last-gasp leveller.

Finally, Correio da manha showed Portugal winger Nani celebrating his opener against the US.

However, after eventually drawing the game the Portuguese publication's headlien reads: 'In the hands of the Germans.'

Ronaldo and Co will be hoping Germany v USA ends with one winner rather than a draw while Portugal must beat Ghana by enough goals to overturn their negative goal difference.
