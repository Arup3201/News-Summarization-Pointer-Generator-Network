Clubs in the Sky Bet Championship have agreed new Financial Fair Play rules in line with those currently used by the Premier League.

The regulations, which come into force at the start of the 2016-17 campaign, will see clubs have their financial performance monitored over three seasons rather than one, the same time frame as top-flight clubs.

The current maximum permitted loss of £8million per season has been increased to an aggregate of £39million over the three seasons before a club would face sanctions.

In the meantime the existing Championship FFP framework will remain in place for the current season and next term, while any punishments due for breaching the rules for last season will still be imposed in December.

The new set of rules, agreed at an EGM at Derby's iPro Stadium on Thursday morning, will in future be known as the 'Profitability and Sustainability' regulations.

Meanwhile, a vote between clubs in Leagues One and Two over the introduction of artificial pitches was tied, meaning the proposals have not been approved.

In what the League called an 'unprecedented' result, 34 clubs voted in favour and 34 against, with four abstentions.

Football League chief executive, Shaun Harvey, said: 'This vote is reflective of the fact that this issue divides opinion amongst clubs as much as it does across the football public.

'While the outcome is different to previous indicative votes, it demonstrates that there is still a desire amongst clubs to find out more about artificial playing surfaces before taking such a significant step.'
