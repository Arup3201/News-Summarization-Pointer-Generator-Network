Two gangsters who 'orchestrated' a dramatic escape from a security van escorting them to court have been handed lengthy jail sentences.

Stevie McMullen, 32, has been jailed for 25 years and Ryan MacDonald, 21, should serve 20 years.

They were being sentenced today along with 11 other members of a Salford gang at Minshull Crown Court in Greater Manchester.

Stevie McMullen, 32, has been jailed for 25 years and Ryan MacDonald, 21, were sprung from a security van escorting them to court. The dramatic escape was caught on CCTV

The prison van was carrying Ryan 
MacDonald, 21, and Stevie McMullen, 32, to Manchester Crown Court from 
Britain's first privately financed prison HMP Altcourse in Merseyside

Jailed: Ryan MacDonald, 20, left, and and Stevie
 McMullen, 32, right, were both convicted of conspiracy to possess an 
imitation firearm at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester. Both 
pleaded guilty to conspiracy to escape at earlier hearings

The pair were sprung at gun-point by an armed gang as the pair were being transported through Salford a year ago.

Shocked
 rush-hour motorists were threatened with an axe and told to back off 
while the front windscreen of the van was smashed before a terrified 
security guard was ordered to open the cells.

MacDonald
 fled as a pillion passenger on board a stolen Yamaha R1 motorcycle 
while McMullen and other gang members fled in a Saab.

McMullen was taken to a safehouse in Bolton and later fled to Spain.

Police
 later released dramatic CCTV footage of the attack on the prison van as
 part of a huge manhunt. McMullen was eventually arrested in Spain a 
year later.

The escape plot 
started to unravel when police found the jacket and mobile phone of the 
man who had ridden the Yamaha motorbike away from Salford. Analysis of 
the phone led police to identify the biker and ten other gang members.

A gang of masked men tracked the prison van before blocking it with a green Saab car in the middle of the street in Salford, Manchester

While
 in prison cocaine-addict McMullen, a father, and McDonald had access to
 'a variety of Sim cards and mobile phone handsets', a court heard.

Police established that one handset was used as 'the escape phone' and analysis of calls led them to other gang members.

Before
 he was sprung, McMullen had been due at Manchester Crown Court charged 
with conspiracy to rob while MacDonald was due to be sentenced for 
unconnected offences of conspiracy to commit robbery.

Ainsley MacDonald, 21, was found guilty of contacting Ryan McDonald on a contraband mobile phone while he was in prison

Crown prosecutor Kim Whittlestone said: 'This
 was a well-organised sophisticated conspiracy orchestrated from inside 
prison with the use of illegally held mobile phones.

'The
 conspiracy was organised by both Stevie McMullen and Ryan MacDonald. 
They each recruited their close criminal associates to put into action 
their plan to escape.'

The pair were sprung from the van as it made its way along Regent Road in Salford from HMP Altcourse, Merseyside, on April 30.

The gang was armed with a pistol, a shotgun, a sledgehammer, crowbar, hatchet and hammer.

McMullen,
 of no fixed abode, was convicted of conspiracy to escape, conspiracy to
 possess an imitation firearm, conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to kidnap 
and arson.

MacDonald, also 
of no fixed abode, was convicted of conspiracy to escape and conspiracy 
to possess an imitation firearm. While he was on the run he was jailed 
for seven years and ten months for a series of robberies.

The sentencing continues.
