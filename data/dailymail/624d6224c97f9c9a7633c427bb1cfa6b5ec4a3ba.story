The Archbishop of Canterbury is due to withdraw his membership at one of London's most exclusive gentlemen's clubs after it decided not to allow women to join.

Justin Welby's decision to quit the Travellers Club in Pall Mall comes just days after the Church of England voted in favour of women becoming bishops.

Earlier this year, 60 per cent of members rejected a move to allow women to join the gentlemen's club.

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby is due to resign from the exclusive gentlemen's Travellers Club in Pall Mall, which does not allow women to join as members

According to the Independent, a Lambeth Palace spokesman confirmed Mr Welby - who she said would have voted for the inclusion of women - intended to resign.

She told the
 paper: 'He can’t remember the vote, which is usually done via correspondence, but would have voted for the inclusion of women.'

The club - whose patron is the Duke of Edinburgh - was founded in 1819 for
 gentlemen who travelled 500 miles out of Britain. It has many foreign 
ambassadors and high commissioners in London among its members.

The Archbishop reportedly used the club as a base when he was Bishop of Durham and Dean of Liverpool.

The club on Pall Mall, London, of which the Duke of Edinburgh is patron, rejected plans earlier this year to welcome women as members

Women are currently allowed in the club as guests but remain banned from the smoking room and cocktail bar, which are reserved for members and their male guests.

The survey which asked members to vote on further inclusion was carried out by club chairman Anthony Layden, a former UK ambassador to Morocco and Libya.

After it was rejected, Mr Layden concluded that 'no further steps should be taken 
towards admitting lady members for the time being'.

Speaking of Mr Welby's resignation, Hilary Cotton, from the organisation Women and the Church, added: 'It sounds like he has made a sensible decision here. It is mainly thanks to him that we will finally have women bishops.'

The Lambeth Palace spokesman said Mr Welby hardly used the club as he now has accommodation in London.
