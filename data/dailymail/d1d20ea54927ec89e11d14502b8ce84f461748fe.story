She gave hope to millions of women everywhere when she appeared outside hospital with her new baby, Prince George, sporting a noticeable baby bump.

But just five weeks later, the Duchess of Cambridge has managed to sensationally snap back into shape  - and is even sporting her pre-pregnancy skinny jeans.

Arriving at her first official engagement since having her son on July 22, Kate looked radiant - without the slightest sign of baby fatigue - in a green tweed hacking jacket, loose geometric-patterned top and a pair of J Brand jeans.

The Duchess of Cambridge undertook her first public engagement following the birth of her baby this morning

A source told MailOnline: 'Initially the Duchess
 wasn't going to attend but she was also keen for the chance to thank 
the people of Anglesey herself for the warmth and hospitality they have 
shown her and the Duke.'

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge got a fit of the giggles as they officially started the Ultra Marathon at the Breakwater Country Park in Holyhead

Happy: Kate and William looked relaxed and radiant as they arrived to start the Anglesey ultra marathon

Despite the uneven surfaces in the Holyhead Breakwater Country Park she also sported her favourite black wedges.

Kate has always been a sporty young woman and kept fit throughout her pregnancy by walking her dog, Lupo, and taking part in regular ante-natal yoga classes.

Yoga not only helps mothers stay healthy before the birth but is also believed to help them regain their figure afterwards by ‘training’ their muscles.

Sarah Barrett, Managing Editor of pregnancy and parenting website BabyCentre UK said: ‘Antenatal yoga is an excellent choice for pregnant women. It’s different from traditional yoga and is a great way to stay in shape both during pregnancy and to help new mums get back into shape after pregnancy.

‘Practicing yoga is also an excellent way to prepare you for labour and the birth of your baby. Kate obviously looks fantastic – and we wouldn’t be surprised if a little yoga was part of her secret.’

Although Prince William recently revealed that his wife was bearing the brunt of baby George’s night feeds - and that their son was proving to be quite a nocturnal little fellow - the Duchess appeared remarkably bright-eyed as she chatted with well-wishers at the start of a gruelling marathon race her husband had agreed to officially start.

The Duchess revealed that her mother, Carole, - or granny as she called her - had come up to babysit.

'He's doing very well. He's with granny at the moment. He's sleeping well but I know these things suddenly change,' she told fellow mother Sarah Bingham, 38.

Mrs Bingham, from Twickenham, south west London, whose second baby is due in just three weeks time, said: 'She looked just wonderful.'

The Duchess revealed that her mother, Carole, - or granny as she called her - had come up to babysit.

'He's doing very well. He's with granny at the moment. He's sleeping well but I know these things change at a minute's notice,' she told fellow mother Sarah Bingham, 38.

Mrs Bingham, from Twickenham, south west London, whose second baby is due in just three weeks time, said: 'She looked just wonderful. I think it is fantastic she has come here today.'

She also told Lauren Hindcliffe, 11: 'George has been very good and sleeping well.'

Stacey Blake, 24, had William in stitches when she handed him a bag of wet-wipes, 'We are getting through a lot of these I can tell you,' he laughed.

'But we could always do with some more.'

Miss Blake from Holyhead said: 'They seem down to earth, you know. I thought they might find it fun.'

The prince himself had the crowds laughing when a baby cried loudly as he walked past.

'We're hearing a bit of that at the moment,' he joked as he cupped his hand to his ear.

His wife added; 'He (George) is sleeping at the moment for now - fingers' crossed!'

At one point the Duchess seemed rather thrown when she encountered George Bailey, nine, from Manchester who had been cycling in the area with his family while on holiday.

As she bent down to chat, George told her matter of factly: 'I don't see the point of a royal family.'

'Oh, well, oh' Kate stuttered.

Fortunately he then added: 'Until today.'

appearance since the birth of her son

The Duke of Cambridge spoke to well wishers at Breakwater Country Park at the start of the race

The Duchess told some well wishers fans how fast George was growing. 'We were talking about the joy she was having from George, and how quickly he was changing. She couldn¿t quite believe how fast he was changing. He was getting quite huge,' said one

The Duchess also said she was keen to get 'back into shape' following George's birth.

Will Stewart, park warden at Holyhead Breakwater Country Park where William rang a bell to start the Ring O’Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon, said the Duchess told him she was “genuinely interested” in doing some more walking around the area – “especially after the baby'.

He said: 'She said she wants to get back into shape. I said, ‘You don’t need to worry about that.’ She looked great.'

Marian Wyn Jones, the High Sheriff of Gwynedd, said the Duchess told her how fast George was growing. 'We were talking about the joy she was having from George, and how quickly he was changing. She couldn’t quite believe how fast he was changing. He was getting quite huge.'

Mrs Jones also spoke to William about his attempts to master the Welsh language, most recently witnessed when he made a speech in Welsh at the Anglesey County Show earlier this month. “He asked what the reception had been to his venture into the Welsh language. It was very well received.'

Not by all, however. “He mentioned that a couple of girls at [RAF] Valley had been critical of a few points.'

He fared less well with Annwen Mary Jones, a 49-year-old hairdresser. “I said to him, ‘Prynhawn Da, William’ – Good afternoon. He said, ‘Bora Da’ – Good morning. I said, ‘No, good afternoon!’

'But he is doing all right. Fair play to him. It is a difficult language to learn.'

The prince himself had the crowds laughing when a baby cried loudly as he walked past. 'We're hearing a bit of that at the moment,' he joked as he cupped his hand to his ear

Jazmine Tomblin, aged six, her sister Hollie, aged nine and their friend Megan Emery-Jones, aged seven, handed a posy of flowers to Kate and a home-made card with a picture of a butterfly made especially for Prince George.

Holly said: 'She said, ‘Where do you live?’ and said ‘We will be coming back soon to visit.’

'We made a butterfly for him with loads of glitter on. She said George really likes bright colours. She's pretty.'

Megan's mother, Louise Emery-Jones, 38, from Menai Bridge, Anglesey, said locals would miss the royal couple, who have been seen living a normal life and during their time on the Island.

'She's been seen shopping in Waitrose, out and about and on the beach at Rhosneigr.

'They have done wonders for the tourist industry. I think it’s been a lovely life for them here. It's a shame they can't live here.

'They've been allowed to just get on with their lives, but obviously things have changed.'  

Ring O' Fire is an annual 135 mile coastal ultra marathon circumnavigating the Isle of Anglesey, North Wales

Kate joined husband Prince William as he officially started the island marathon on Anglesey

Kate and William looked the picture of happiness when they left the Lindo Wing the day after George's birth

The
 Duchess's next official engagement will be on September 12 when she 
attends the inaugural Tusk Conservation Awards with her husband in 
London.

Today's event is 
the prince's last official engagement on the island before leaving to 
take up a new military posting next month.

He has lived in a rented farmhouse in North Wales for just over three years, the last two with wife Kate.

After
 George's birth the couple went to live with Kate's parents, Michael and
 Carole Middleton, at their £4.8 million mansion in Bucklebury, 
Berkshire.

William returned
 to his job as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley two weeks later  
following the end of his statutory paternity leave.

Kate and his son then joined him a a fortnight ago.

The Ring O’ Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon is a gruelling annual 135 mile coastal marathon circumnavigating the entire island.

At the start of the race, William will meet a number of the runners and their families as well as a selection of volunteers involved in organising it.

Over three days runners will follow the island's coastal path, much of which is designated an 'Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty'.

Kate's decision to attend suggests that 'little rascal' George may be sleeping more at night

Competitors encounter a wide variety of terrain, including estuaries sandy beaches, cliff top paths, sand dunes, fields, forest and road. 

The 135 mile distance and 13,695 feet of vertical ascent make the Ring O’ Fire one of the most extreme ultra marathons in the United Kingdom.

Race Directors, Quentin Brooksbank and James Bingham started the gruelling event as an 'inspirational challenge' that attracts international runners to the island that they grew up on.

In a statement Kensington Palace said: 'The Duchess of Cambridge will now attend the Ring O’ Fire Anglesey Coastal Ultra Marathon with The Duke of Cambridge this afternoon.

'The Duchess will join The Duke in meeting a number of the runners and their families and a selection of volunteers involved in the administration of the race before The Duke officially starts the Ultra Marathon. ‬ 'The Duke and Duchess will not take Prince George to the event.'

At the moment the couple have no maternity nurse or nanny.
