Peter Zervas, pictured in 2009, had half of his nose bitten off in an attack at his Leichhardt home on Tuesday

A former Hells Angels bikie was on the 'straight and narrow' before he had his nose bitten off in a horrific attack at his home, a friend says.

Peter Zervas, 38, had to pick his nose up off the ground, drive himself to hospital and have it surgically reattached after he was assaulted at his unit in Leichhardt in Sydney's inner-west at 5pm on Tuesday.

The friend of 'Pete' Zervas, who did not wish to be named, said the recently-married businessman had turned his life around.

'He has had his Hells Angels tattoos and things removed,' he told the ABC.

'He is married now, he has a good business and he has been on the straight and narrow now for about three years.'

Blood splattered on the front steps of the Norton Street unit complex was cleaned off on Wednesday and detectives were at the scene talking to nearby business owners.

Mr Zervas's brother Anthony Zervas was killed in a brawl between rival bikie gangs at Sydney Airport in 2009.

A week after the brawl Peter Zervas was shot more than six times while getting out of his car in front of his Lakemba home in southwest Sydney, but he survived the attack.

The news of Tuesday's attack comes as former Comanchero bikie boss Mahmoud 'Mick' Hawi, who was jailed over the fatal bashing of Anthony Zervas, is due to be released after he was granted conditional bail on Monday.

Hawi applied for release under the controversial new bail act last month after his 2009 conviction for the murder of Anthony Zervas was quashed earlier this year. He is awaiting a retrial.

Mr Zervas, 29, died after being bashed with a bollard when members of the two bikie gangs began brawling at Sydney Airport.

On Wednesday Inspector Clive Ainley from Leichhardt Local Area Command said police were looking for CCTV footage to help identify the offender.

Inspector Ainley told MailOnline it was still not known whether the victim knew the attacker, but he said the 38-year-old let the man into his home.

'The victim opened the door and then he was attacked,' he said.

Inspector Ainley said the man was in a stable condition.

'He hasn't said much at this stage,' he said.

'With his nose half bitten off you can't be going into a long interview.'

Inspector Ainley said the victim would be formally interviewed later today when he was feeling better.

Police are looking for CCTV footage to help identify the man who attacked the 38-year-old. The offender was last seen fleeing along the Parramatta Road end of Norton Street (pictured)
