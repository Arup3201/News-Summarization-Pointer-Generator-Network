Judging by these photographs, racing car enthusiast Edmund Burgess is lucky to be alive after crashing his £250,000 vintage Bugatti. 

The 56-year-old, from Lavenham, Suffolk, was competing in the Prescott Speed Hill Climb, in Winchcombe, Gloucestershire, on Sunday, when the brakes on his 1924 classic Bugatti failed.

The car began to tilt as it went around a hairpin bend before it crashed into the side of a wall crushing Mr Burgess inside.

Astonishingly, despite the extensive damage, he managed to climb out of the wreckage alive, dust himself down and went to a nearby bar for a beer.

He said: 'It happened very suddenly. I was approaching a hairpin bend and I was going a little faster than usual, maybe 30mph, when I tried to brake. 

'Before I knew it, I'd lost control and the car toppled over.

'When I saw how damaged the car was, I was amazed I could pull myself out and walk away. I was very lucky.'

Mr Burgess, who is director of the Bugatti Owners' Club, hopes to be back in the driving seat in eight weeks time after he has repaired the car.

Incredibly Mr Burgess got out of the upside down car and dusted himself off before paramedics arrived

Lucky escape: Thankfully the driver's helmet must have hit the barrier saving his life

The front wheel, bonnet and scuttle were all damaged in the smash. 

He said: 'My helmet must have hit the barrier, but otherwise I was OK. I decided to sit the rest of the event out in the bar with a beer.

'I'm just irritated more than anything because it means I can't compete again until this one is repaired.'

Automobiles Ettore Bugatti was a French car manufacturer of high-performance automobiles founded in 1909 by Italian-born Ettore Bugatti.

They were known for their design and beauty as well as their many racing victories. 

The Type 35 started out in 1924 as a 2-liter race car that won many races in different categories and under various sets of regulations until 1931.

The last version of this model was a 2.3-liter car with compressor, known as T35 TC or T35B.

The T35 was the only automobile of its time that could be driven both on the road and in races.
