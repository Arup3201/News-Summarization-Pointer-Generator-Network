Immigrants are being granted permission to settle in Britain despite having ‘zero income and no employment’, a government inspector warned last night.

The failure to carry out full background checks on the migrants undermines a key Home Office policy that applicants should be able to support themselves and their families without relying on the State.

Foreign nationals who want to remain in the UK permanently are supposed to undergo strict checks by officials into their financial background.

The chief inspector of immigration John Vine found potentially tens of thousands of applicants were approved without face-to-face interviews.

As a minimum, they require enough money to pay for housing, plus a disposable income of more than £100 a week.

But the chief inspector of immigration, John Vine, found potentially tens of thousands were having their applications rubber-stamped without either a face-to-face interview or HMRC investigation.

An estimated one million migrants apply for permission to stay in the UK each year.

But, incredibly, HMRC is willing to do only 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency – just 250 every month. Such checks would establish if a migrant who claimed to be able to support themselves was telling the truth about their income or even having a job.

As a result of the HMRC policy, officials are letting migrants stay without having had access to wages slips, P60 forms and other crucial data.

Mr Vine, who carried out spot checks on a small sample of cases, said officials had granted permission to settle here despite the applicant having ‘zero income and no employment’.

He said the number of HMRC checks was ‘insufficient’ and must be urgently increased.

Of 49 cases he looked at where 
migrants were asking to stay on the grounds of marriage, not a single 
person was interviewed. This is despite huge concern over sham 
marriages.

In other cases, 
the application was decided while the husband or wife was still 
overseas. Mr Vine said in one in every ten of such cases the decision 
reached by immigration officials was ‘unreasonable’, mainly due to 
insufficient evidence the migrant could afford to support themselves.

The inspector raised his concerns in a report which focused on how UKBA handles cases involving marriage and civil partnerships.

In
 it, he also said there are currently more than 16,000 migrants waiting 
to hear from border officials whether they can stay in Britain in yet 
another ‘unacceptable’ UKBA backlog.

Some
 14,000 applicants, growing at a rate of 700 a month, have already been 
refused the right to stay but are pleading with officials to reconsider.

An
 additional 2,100 cases – shipped in a box from a UKBA office in Croydon
 to Sheffield – are still waiting for an initial decision, some dating 
back a decade.

Mr Vine said: ‘This is completely unacceptable and I 
expect the Agency to deal with both types of case as a matter of 
urgency.

Ferry passengers caught entering Britain with cocaine in their luggage are being let off with just a small fine.

Instead
 of arresting and prosecuting, border officials are routinely 
confiscating the drugs, allowing passengers to pay around £100 and then 
letting them carry on their journey.

John
 Vine, chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, said the approach was
 unlawful and anyone caught with Class A drugs should be put before a 
court.

His report into 
border controls found two occasions where a small amount of cocaine was 
discovered on a passenger or in their luggage coming into Dover via 
Calais.

Both cases involved less than 1g of the drug. 

Under
 customs laws, passengers caught with small amounts of Class B and C 
drugs can pay a ‘compound settlement’, have the drugs confiscated and 
escape prosecution.

But 
that law does not extend to Class A drugs. Anyone caught entering with 
even small amounts of heroin, cocaine or ecstasy must be arrested and 
can face a lengthy prison sentence.

The
 report said: ‘Although the amount was small, we were concerned that in 
one case investigators advised a compound settlement for the offence, 
given that this was contrary to Border Force’s own guidance.

‘Border
 Force subsequently informed us that they had revised their guidance to 
reiterate that class A drugs fall outside the scope of compounding.’

‘Delays also mean 
enforcement action is likely to be more difficult in the event the case 
is ultimately refused. This is because the individual will have been in 
the UK for a number of years and may have developed a family or private 
life.’

He also said the 
percentage of successful appeals in marriage cases was too high, at 53 
per cent from April 2011 to February last year.

Mr Vine told Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'Work is being transferred but missed or lost. The organisation should know what its own backlog and workload is, then it can prioritise.

'I was concerned at the high rate of appeal.'

He admitted that 13 per cent of cases remained unresolved.

Mark Harper, Minister of State for Immigration, told the show that the 14,000 outstanding appeals had not been done through the proper channels.

'We went and just allowed people to say, "can you just go through it again?" They should have given a clear message.

'We inherited an agency with a lot of problems.'

Sir Andrew Green, of 
Migration Watch, said: ‘This is yet further evidence of the chaos in the
 immigration system.’

UKBA
 said last night: ‘We are working with HMRC to increase the number of 
searches we can do against their systems. Since this report we have 
brought in strict new rules on proving income levels to make sure that 
those bringing in family members are able to support them.’
