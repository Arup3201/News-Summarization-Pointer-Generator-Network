A picturesque village immortalised in the paintings of John Constable is at the centre of a middle-class crime mystery following the introduction of controversial parking charges.

Dedham - which lies on the Essex and Suffolk border - had all the coin slots in its parking meters filled will glue in an apparent angry reaction to the local council's bid to bring in charges.

The village - which featured in a number of Constable's most famous paintings and has been declared an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty - has long been free to park in.

The village's attractive main street is lined with Georgian-fronted houses, old inns and a large art centre

The River Stour, which flows through the village, is hugely popular with tourists during the Easter and summer breaks

But many feel tourist numbers will plummet due to new parking charges introduced by the local council

But 
council bosses recently voted to end the free scheme in favour of an
 unpopular policy of charging people on the busiest roads.

The
 changes, introduced last month, led to an outpouring of opposition from
 local traders, who fear charges of up to £4 for parking will lead to a 
significant fall in visitor numbers.

It
 now appears that someone has taken action into their own hands after, 
following the Easter weekend, all the payment slots on the new parking 
meters were mysteriously filled with foaming glue, making them 
impossible to use.

Dedham's
 traders have denied they are responsible, suggesting instead that irate
 tourists who have enjoyed years of free parking may have committed the 
crime.

One resident, who asked not to be named, said: 'It is not exactly the Poll Tax riots but people are angry about the introduction of the parking charges.

Visitors have enjoyed free parking in the area for years, making it a popular getaway destination at weekends

Traders fear the number of visitors to the area will fall next year after visitors to the area learn of the charges this summer

'Tourists 
do flock to Dedham and the money they bring is worth millions every year
 so I think that is why there is so much concern.

'It is fair to say it was a very middle class piece of vandalism but people are not used to committing crime here.'

Ian
 Wicks, development manager for the Essex Federation of Small 
Businesses, said: 'The people who have done this have done a right job 
on the meters by the looks of it.

'Clearly we would not condone this sort of behaviour. However, it does represent a feeling around the charges being introduced.'

Jenny Pearmain, landlady of the village's Marlborough Head Inn, said that since the charges were introduced on April 1, customers were now more likely to question how long their food would take to arrive.

However, she does not believe it is an angry trader who is responsible for parking meter vandalism.

She
 said: 'Dedham businesses do not behave like that. I am sure it is an 
irate tourist who has been coming to Dedham for years and has now found 
they have to pay.'

Mrs 
Pearmain fears the impact of the changes will only be truly felt next 
year as tourists may be put off returning once they are aware that free 
parking has ended.

The
 new regime gives one hour of free parking before charges of £1 for up 
to two hours and £2 for up to four hours kick in, with parking for the 
entire day now costing £4.

Profits are being shared between Colchester Borough Council and Dedham Parish Council, with the cash raised earmarked for improvements to the village's car parks.

The nearby countryside is frequently voted on the best lowland landscapes and is famous for its water meadows

It inspired some of Constable's most famous works. Pictured is a view of the Stour, dated 1822

The vandalised machines have since been fixed and are operational again, but Essex Police are investigating and have called for witnesses to contact them.

Martin Hunt, Colchester borough councillor for street services, said: 'This is clearly not an attempt at theft.

'It is a wanton and repeated act of vandalism, intended to stop the council from carrying out a legitimate policy.

'This policy has been agreed by the parish authority and will produce both better car park and local community facilities.

'I fully support Essex Police in their aim to to catch and prosecute someone who clearly believes he, or she, is above the law.
