A bankrupt company boss is attempting to make legal history by claiming he is unable to pay maintenance to his ex-wife because he has no money.

If Alexander McRoberts gets his £350,000 claim written off, it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges the High Court heard.

Mr McRoberts , 54 of Datchet, Berkshire, is asking the court to rule his matrimonial debt did not ‘survive’ his declaration of bankruptcy in 2006.

Legal history: If Alexander McRoberts (right) gets his claim that he is unable to pay maintenance to his ex-wife Mandy McRoberts (left) because he is bankrupt, it could open the flood gates to similar legal challenges

He was once the head of a multi-million pound company who separated from his wife Mandy McRoberts in 2003. Under their divorce agreement, she was given their marital house and Mr McRoberts agreed to pay her more than £500,000 in instalments.

Mrs McRoberts, who lives in a £500,000 house in Newton Court, Old Windsor, had received £211,000 of that money before her ex-husband fell on hard times and declared himself bankrupt.

Mrs McRoberts, who is a director of a chauffeur-driven car hire company, now wants the remaining £349,000 he still owes her from the divorce settlement but this is ‘impossible’ for Mr McRoberts now, the court heard.

His bankruptcy was discharged in September 2007 and Mr McRoberts later re-established himself as CEO of an international baggage handling firm, although his barrister, Simon Calhaem, said ‘the curtain has come down’ on that venture.

His ex-wife was registered as a creditor in his bankruptcy and Mr Calhaem said that Mr McRoberts feared he will be again bankrupted if his debt to Mrs McRoberts is not expunged. 

Acknowledging that the case raises a ‘novel point’ of potentially huge significance, Mr Calhaem told the judge: ‘Mr McRoberts' financial position is such as to make any chance of a payment of £349,000 impossible now, or in the foreseeable future.

‘Mrs McRoberts' financial circumstances, as is clear, are far more comfortable than her ex-husband's.’

‘Neither Mr or Mrs McRoberts have had any real contact with each other or any knowledge of each other’s dealings since 2003.’

Although
Mrs McRoberts ‘challenges the veracity of her ex-husband's financial 
status,’ Mr Calhaem insisted that ‘a full scale change in his financial 
circumstances’ had taken place.

'Further reflection': Justice Robert Hildyard said at the High Court (pictured) that the case 'raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction'

Byron James, representing Mrs McRoberts, warned the judge that a ruling in Mr McRoberts’ favour could create a legal loophole for exploitation by unscrupulous spouses.

It would be ‘opening the door to all the bankrupts out there who don't want to pay their lumps sums in family proceedings,’ Mr James said.

Mr Justice Hildyard said: ‘I don't want to do anything that suggests that so long as you go into bankruptcy that is the gateway to avoiding the family court's orders. There are lots and lots of husbands and wives who are company directors. 

‘The default position is that, although the bankrupt gets a new start in life, he still has round his neck orders made in family proceedings for lump sums and costs.’

‘If the on-going order was made as a crystal ball assessment of the parties' needs, it may well be that the bankruptcy court can take those changing needs into account.’

Mr Justice Hildyard said the case ‘raised some curiosity as to the relationship between the bankruptcy jurisdiction and the family jurisdiction’ and that ‘there is a point which possibly needs some further reflection’.

The decision on the case was reserved until a later date.

Neither Mr McRoberts nor Mrs McRoberts made any comment outside court.
