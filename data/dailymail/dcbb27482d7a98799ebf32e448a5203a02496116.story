She's a scream: Ariana Richards is a respected portrait artist now

During a break in the filming of epic dinosaur movie Jurassic Park, director Steven Spielberg introduced its 12-year-old star, Ariana Richards, to his special on-set visitor that day, veteran actress Fay Wray.

The beautiful heroine of movie classics such as 1933’s King Kong, Wray was known as the ‘Scream Queen’ for her ability to issue blood-curdling cries at the drop of a hat.

‘So Steven brought her right to me  on set and said: “From one great screamer to another,” ’ says Ariana. ‘I think he even dedicated one of my screams to Fay.’

As Lex Murphy, one of the unlucky visitors to Jurassic Park, Ariana’s on-screen howling could shred lettuce.

She yelled her head off most memorably when she came face to face with an enormous Tyrannosaurus Rex.

‘I remember Steven saying: “Ariana, what on earth are you drawing from when you’re screaming? Were you frightened by a clown when you were really young?” So I guess I must have been doing something right.’

The scene where Lex and her on-screen brother Tim (Joseph Mazzello) have to fend off the advances of a very hungry  T-Rex while trapped in a Jeep is one of the most unforgettable in a film that broke box office records at the time.

Released in 1993, Jurassic Park took more than £750 million in ticket sales and, along with two sequels, went on to make almost £2 billion.

A Blu-ray version of the Jurassic trilogy has been released — 18 years later, the film has lost none of its ability to scare and entertain.

The premise — based on a Michael Crichton novel — was startlingly simple: what would happen if genetically recreated dinosaurs could roam the Earth with humans? And as the story unfolds, we soon get our answer: they’d have us for breakfast.

‘Steven told us that as a child he had a deep longing to live alongside dinosaurs, though obviously without being eaten alive,’ says Ariana. ‘Joseph and I got to live his dream on set.’

Fright night: Ariana, aged 12, in the film

It’s bizarre seeing her today – a woman of 32 and a respected portrait artist – when she’s etched so indelibly in our minds as the shrieking granddaughter of Jon Hammond (Richard Attenborough), a billionaire whose plan to keep live dinosaurs in the Jurassic Park theme park goes so spectacularly awry.

Ariana and Lord Attenborough formed a special bond. ‘The warmth he has on screen is exactly what he was like in person,’ she says. ‘He was perfectly cast as the grandfather.’

The film marked Lord Attenborough’s return to acting after a 15-year break, during which he directed acclaimed films such as Gandhi and Cry Freedom.

When he won the 1983 Best Director Oscar for Gandhi, he insisted it should have gone to Spielberg for E.T. The two men became friends and Attenborough was persuaded to get back in front of the camera at the age of 69.

When Spielberg asked if he would be able to perform a particularly challenging scene,  ‘Richard just said: “Steven, I lived through the Blitz. Don’t you worry about me,” ’ says Ariana.

‘He always had a twinkle in his eye. I knew more about his brother David from The Trials Of Life on TV. Not that I told  Richard that.

‘I just wish I’d had more scenes with him and had kept in touch with him after filming. I did keep in touch with Steven. He never failed to send me a birthday or Christmas gift every year.’

The film also featured Sam Neill, who took the role of paleontologist Dr Alan Grant after Harrison Ford and William Hurt turned it down. Laura Dern played his girlfriend and Jeff Goldblum was Dr Ian Malcolm.

Yet the real stars of the movie were the dinosaurs. Though today’s cinema-goers are used to the wonders of CGI, the beasts in Jurassic Park were a blend of computer wizardry and animatronics. 

‘That scene where I’m looking terrified as the car is attacked wasn’t that hard because the entire T-Rex head was in my face,’ says Ariana.

‘People assume I was looking at a tennis ball on a stick, but they built this huge model. I could see its eyes moving and its body breathing. It was pretty scary.’ 

Groundbreaking: A scene from the 1993 film Jurassic Park, which broke box office records when it was it was released 18 years ago

The T-Rex was 24ft long, weighed four tonnes and was considered ground-breaking stuff. At the other end of the scale, in the scene where a Velociraptor opens the kitchen door, a glove puppet was used. 

When Jurassic Park premiered in Britain in July 1993, Princess Diana was the guest of honour and Spielberg asked Ariana to present her with a bouquet.

‘I was sitting behind her in the cinema and could see her getting lower and lower in her chair. It really was a pretty scary film.’

Ariana also starred in the sequel, The Lost World. With dinosaurs getting a new lease of life in the TV series Terra Nova (executive produced by Spielberg), there’s talk of a fourth Jurassic film.

‘I think it would be great to bring back Jurassic Park,’ says Ariana. ‘I had no inkling at the time how big the movie was going to be. Even 20 years later, people still say: “Hey, you’re that girl who could really scream!” ’
