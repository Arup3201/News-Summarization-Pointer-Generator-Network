Ofcom is to ban mobile phone firms from charging customers who call 0800 numbers.

Currently, mobile users pay up to 40p a minute to dial the numbers, which are free to call from a landline and are used by many public bodies, including councils and the NHS.

The regulator is due to ban the practice within weeks and introduce rules to clarify other charges for so-called non-geographic numbers beginning with 08 or 09.

Such changes will help reveal the true cost of taking part in phone votes for reality TV shows such as Britain’s Got Talent.

Phone companies will be required to inform customers of the standard cost of calling an 09 premium number, while TV companies running the polls will have to show additional charges on-screen.

Ofcom is also planning to clear up the confusion surrounding the cost of using 118 directory enquiry services. 

Scandals involving such services 
include one customer receiving a bill for £350 after he was connected to
 the number he wanted, while another was charged £62 after being put 
through to NHS Direct for medical advice.

As
 with 09 numbers, phone companies will be required to spell out the 
standard charge for calling a 118 service under Ofcom’s proposals.

Directory enquiry firms will also have to advertise what charges they apply on top of this figure.

The plans were first outlined at the end of 2010. Following a consultation, Ofcom is set to announce its decisions imminently.

The regulator’s chief executive, Ed Richards, has highlighted the need for change, saying: ‘There is clear evidence of widespread uncertainty and confusion about the cost of calling these numbers.

‘Consumers need to have far more transparency about the price they are going to pay for calls so that they can make more informed choices and so competition can work more effectively.

‘Making 0800 free from a mobile and giving people clarity about what they are paying for 118 directory enquiry services will improve transparency, improve competition and enhance trust in these important services.’
