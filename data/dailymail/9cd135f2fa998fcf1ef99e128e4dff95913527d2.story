Jon Hiles, 18, was with friends partying on the Greek island of Zante when he died after he was allegedly hit in the face

A young British tourist died after being punched in a nightclub on the first day of a Greek holiday - and his killer has still not been brought to justice almost six years later, an inquest has heard.

Jon Hiles, 18, was with friends partying on the Greek island of Zante when he was allegedly hit in the face.

Hockey player Mr Hiles fell from a stage - hitting his head on the club's crowded dance floor.

The inquest heard he was airlifted to hospital in Athens but died the day before his 19th birthday.

But the mystery attacker who threw a punch at Mr Hiles has never been convicted almost six years after his death.

Fellow British holidaymaker Andrew Symeou, 25, was arrested and tried in Greece but was cleared of any wrong doing.

He was in court yesterday alongside Mr Hiles's friends and family for the young hockey star's inquest.

Heartbroken father Denzil, 62, told the hearing: 'Jon was my son and also my friend, his mother and I cared for him dearly.

'But his life was tragically stolen from him while he was on holiday with friends in Zante. I was with Jon holding his hand when his monitor showed a flat line and he passed away.'

Mr Hiles had gone on holiday to celebrate his 19th birthday when he died.

His father said: 'His passion was ice and roller hockey - it all started when he saw the film Mighty Ducks. Although hockey is a contact sport and fights break out during games Jon was not a fighter.

'All he would be concerned with was protecting his face - he was a good looking, a popular lad, he always found it difficult to walk past a mirror.'

Sports science student Mr Hiles travelled from his home in Llandaff, Cardiff, to the Greek party island with a group of friends.

On the night Mr Hiles suffered his injuries, the friends had been at a club called 'Rescue' (pictured) when they were involved in an altercation

The Cardiff inquest heard how the pals had been at a club called 'Rescue' when they were involved in an altercation.

The friends were dancing on a 'chest-high' stage in the nightclub when another reveller urinated on them.

When Mr Hiles confronted him, the man allegedly punch him in the face causing him to fall from the stage and bang his head.

Mr Hiles was desrcribed as a 'good looking' and 'popular lad' by his father during the inquest

Home Office pathologist Andrew Davidson said Mr Hiles, who was not under the influence of drink or drugs, died of a head injury.

He said: 'I found evidence of blunt force trauma to the back of the head.

'There was also evidence of three fractures emanating from the back of the middle of his head.'

The inquest continues.
