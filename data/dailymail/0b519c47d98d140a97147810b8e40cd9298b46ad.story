A new graphic video has been made public showing the brutal September biker attack on a motorist in New York City.

The grainy 51-second footage was obtained by ABC Eyewitness News. According to the station, police have seen the clip and used it to identify the nine motorcyclists accused of assaulting driver Alexian Lien.

The shaky footage shot September 29 on the Henry Hudson Parkway begins with a large group of bikers surrounding Lien's black Range Rover.

New evidence: The grainy 51-second footage of the September 29 biker attack was obtained by ABC Eyewitness News

Marks of violence: The Range Rover's rear right tire is flat, and there is a in the rear windshield

Ganging up: The shaky video shows a group of bikers converging on the driver of the SUV and dragging him out of the vehicle

The vehicle seen in the video exhibits clear signs of violence: its rear right tire is flat, and there is a gaping hole in the rear windshield.

Just seconds later, several motorcyclists could be seen approaching the driver's side of the vehicle and pulling Lien out of the car.

The graphic footage then depicts men in helmets surrounding Lien lying on the ground and proceeding to kick and stomp him.

In the next frame, the young married father could be seen lying motionless with his face down. 

The 33-year-odl man needed stitches after the beat-down that took place after he ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his SUV while trying to escape from the scrum of motorcyclists. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralyzed.

Investigators reportedly used this 51-second video to identify the alleged assailants, among them several police officers, and arrest them.

A ninth biker, 40-year-old Jason Brown, was taken into custody Monday night in Brooklyn in connection with the Lien assault.

He is charged with gang assault, assault and criminal mischief. 

Meanwhile, an undercover police detective arrested in a motorcyclist-SUV melee no longer plans to testify before a grand jury, his lawyer said Monday.

Attorney John Arlia initially indicated that Detective Wojciech Braszczok wanted to speak to the Manhattan grand jury that's considering indicting him. But Arlia said Monday he's advised Braszczok not to do so ‘because the evidence speaks for him.’

‘My client has complete confidence and faith this grand jury will determine that he in no way intended to injure, nor act in any way to injure’ an SUV driver who was beaten by several other bikers, the attorney said. Video and other evidence will show Braszczok didn't come close to contact with the driver, Arlia said.

The Manhattan district attorney's office has said Braszczok nonetheless actively participated in the attack by shattering the SUV's back window and kicking its passenger side, and he has been charged with gang assault. The DA's office declined to comment Monday on his decision not to testify.

Many defendants ultimately choose not to testify before grand juries, for various reasons. It's not uncommon for defendants to give notice that they want to appear and then change their minds.

Suspect: Biker Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn, was arrested last week in connection with the road rage attack

Claims: Clint Caldwell, 32, alleges that Alexian Lien, 33, ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway last month

Braszczok was off-duty when he participated in a Sept. 29 motorcycle rally that took a violent turn. He's one of several riders who have since been arrested.’

After the SUV driver bumped a bike that had slowed in front of it, motorcyclists surrounded and converged on the Range Rover SUV; its driver fled in fear for the loved ones riding with him and ran over a biker, and motorcyclists chased him, pulled him from the vehicle and attacked him, police and prosecutors say.

The encounters were partly caught on a helmet-camera video posted online.

The SUV driver, Alexian Lien, hasn't been charged with any crime.

Braszczok did nothing to stop the assault or summon help, didn't report having been there to his superiors for a few days, and wasn't straightforward when he did, prosecutors said.

The detective was stripped of his gun and badge after internal affairs investigators discovered he saw at least part of the confrontation. He initially told authorities and his union that he didn't intervene in the attack partly because he works undercover.

Arlia has said that the window Braszczok is accused of breaking already had a sizeable hole in it. The detective didn't know other participants in the rally, which was organized online, and he pursued Lien only to prevent his flight after the SUV ran down and seriously injured motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr., Arlia said.

‘The facts cannot be changed to lump him into an attack he was not a part of. We owe him and his family at least that much,’ Arlia said by phone Monday.

Braszczok has been a police officer for a decade. It's unclear when the grand jury might vote on whether to indict him.

Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn was charged last week with gang assault and assault with intent to cause serious injury for his involvement,

Bikers Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright made court appearances last week on October 11.
