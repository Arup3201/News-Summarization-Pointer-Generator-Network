There is no doubt the perfect baby name is hard to pick, but a unique one is even harder to come by.

Reddit user thebdizzle spawned a viral thread by asking: 'What are people naming their children that they really shouldn't be?', after a Facebook friend announced that they had named their child 'Dude Lorenzo'.

And it seems thebdizzle was not alone in his shock over the newborn's name - which could be a tip of the hat to actor Jeff Bridges' character named 'The Dude' in cult hit, The Big Lebowski or a reference to the Ashton Kutcher movie, Dude Where's My Car?.

Some parents have drawn inspiration from popular book and TV series Game of Thrones, by naming their child Khaleesi (played by Emilia Clarke, pictured)

'Well, its only 6am and I found my story of the day that makes me question my faith in humanity, thanks,' Slikrick98 wrote.

While theschizophreniac agreed: 'Poor kid. I can only imagine the hilarity of his teachers referring to him as dude.'

While it seems some parents took inspiration from literature - including Game of Thrones and The Hunger Games - others left Redditors scratching their heads.

User technicolours also came across parents who gave the royal monikers Your Highness and Your Majesty, a new twist.

Redditors have also heard of parents calling their children, Katniss, from The Hunger Games book and TV series

A Reddit thread was started after it emerged a baby was named Dude, which could be a nod to Jeff Bridges' (pictured) character The Dude in The Big Lebowski

'I did a clinical rotation at a pediatric facility, and I had two patients named YrHyness & YrMagesty. It's really hard not to laugh when you're asking a 3 year old, "Does your tummy hurt YrHyness?"' they said.

While Exodia101 claimed to know someone named 'iMajesty' to which Animalgeologist replied: 'Is he a new Apple product?'

Other baby names included Susej (pronounced 'Suzy'), Starblanket, Cviiitlyn (a version of Caitlin), Jew'lrii ('jewellery'), Yoonik ('eunuch'), Sharkeisha, Iysabeyl (a take on Isabel), Cevyn ('seven'), Ziggy, Sincerely Yours, Macaroni and Spaghetti.

Meanwhile others took inspiration from fiction and made it there own form of reality with names like Katniss from The Hunger Games, Aragorn and Elrond from The Lord of the Rings, Khaleesi from Game of Thrones and Holden from The Catcher in the Rye.

Of The Hunger Games reference, bastocrat said: 'You just know that all the other kids will call her "catp***".'

And nfriel had a bone to pick with the nod to Game of Thrones: '"Khaleesi" is the worst. It's not even the character's name! It's a title in a made-up fantasy language.'

The latest celebrity to jump on board with the unique baby names trend is former British glamour model, Katie Price.

She hit back at critics last week after she was mocked for naming her newborn daughter, Bunny. 

The new mum wrote in her column for Now magazine: 'Bunny is an old-fashioned name and I love it. Some may ridicule our choice and some will love it - I really don't care to be honest.' 

Price said the name suits the tiny tot because she embodies all things a bunny rabbit represents - 'soft, cute, cuddly, unique...fun'.

Other names mentioned in the thread included Starblanket, Jew'lrii, Yoonik, Sharkeisha and Iysabeyl
