Renowned children's author Roald Dahl may have famously written that it took 501 seagulls to help James fly the Giant Peach - but a scientific study has concluded that the actual figure would need to be significantly higher.

Calculations by a group of University of Leicester physics students show a total of 2,425,907 birds would be needed to lift the peach - the size of a small house in Dahl's story - into the air.

The undergraduates were inspired to use the childhood tale, which has delighted youngsters across the world since it was first published in the 1960s, as the basis for a scientific paper.

James and the giant peach saw a young boy traveling in a large peach held by 501 seagulls. However, researchers now say it would have taken 2.5m to lift the huge fruit.

The group first calculated the 
weight of the peach, using measurements described in the book.

By multiplying its density by its 
volume, and using Newton's famous second law of motion, they arrived at a
 figure of 4,890,579 Newtons - the amount of force it would take to move
 the peach.

Next, they worked out how much weight
 each seagull could lift

They calculated this at just over two Newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach.

In the book, a young boy named James 
embarks on a journey across the Atlantic Ocean on a magical peach, 
enlisting seagulls to carry it.

One
 of the students, Emily Jane Watkinson, said: 'Our degree encourages us 
to learn and apply real principles of physics to new and imaginative 
topics, and as all of us knew the story and I particularly loved it, we 
thought it would be a great idea to use it for our paper.

'Earlier in our degree, we studied the physics of aircraft and specifically what it takes to get them into the air.

'We thought it would be fantastic to apply that knowledge to the giant peach.'

The group first calculated the potential weight of the peach, using measurements based on the size of a small house, as described in the book.

By multiplying its density by its volume, and using Newton's famous second law of motion, they arrived at a figure of 4,890,579 Newtons - the amount of force it would take to move the peach.

Next, they worked out how much weight each seagull could lift based on its wingspan, the density of air around it and the speed it would travel.

Written
 in 1961 by Roald Dahl,Â  James and the Giant Peach tells the story of a 
young English orphan boy, Henry Trotter.

He enters a gigantic, magical 
peach leading to a series of strange adventures with six insects
 he meets.

Originally titled James and the Giant 
Cherry, Dahl changed it to James and the Giant Peach because a peach is 
'prettier, bigger and squishier' than a cherry.

According to the book, the stone at the centre of the peach becomes a New York apartment where James lives.

It was adapted into a film of the same name in 1996.

They calculated this at just over two Newtons - allowing them to work out how many it would take to lift the peach.

Emily-Jane added: 'It showed us that 501 seagulls would be nowhere near enough to lift the peach, and that it would take much more - nearly 2.5 million seagulls to do this.

'We've all had a brilliant time working on this project.

'It's been lots of fun, and it's been great using Roald Dahl's story as inspiration.

'It's also helped show us how to write a proper scientific paper.'

Course leader Dr Mervyn Roy, a lecturer at the university's department of physics and astronomy, said: 'A lot of the papers we published are on subjects that are amusing, topical, or a bit off-the-wall. Our students are nothing if not creative.

'But, to be a research physicist you need to show some imagination, and this is something that the module allows our students to practice.'
