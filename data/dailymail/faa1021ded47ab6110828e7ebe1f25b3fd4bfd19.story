David Cameron's spin doctor helped his celebrity wife run an 'avoidance' scheme that may have diverted thousands away from the tax man, it was claimed today.

Craig Oliver's partner, BBC news presenter Joanna Gosling, could have pocketed an extra £22,000 a year by being paid through a private company the pair set up, according to newspaper reports.

It comes just days after the Prime Minister declared comedian Jimmy Carr 'morally wrong' for putting millions in an offshore tax dodging scheme.

But it appears one of his closest aides helped his wife to run a company for several years that may have reduced the tax she paid on her estimated £150,000-a-year earnings.

Claims: The Daily Mirror has said a business set up to handle BBC presenter Joanna Gosling's pay was an 'avoidance' scheme

'It is total hypocrisy and Craig Oliver should stay out of Downing Street until it is sorted out,' Labour MP John Mann told the Mirror last night.

'The Jimmy Carr publicity stunt has clearly come back to haunt the Prime Minister.'

Mr Oliver, who is a former senior BBC executive, ran Paya Limited with Ms Gosling to handle her earnings. He was paid £2,999.97 to be secretary.

The TV presenter hit the headlines herself recently after wearing a short skirt to work on the BBC Breakfast sofa.

Classed as a 'TV and journalism' company, they were helped by accountant Nicholas Ridge, who says he helps TV producers 'make sure their tax bills are kept as low as possible'.

Figures from Companies House seen by MailOnline show that around £150,000 a year was funnelled into Paya.

If Ms Gosling had earned the cash via PAYE she would have paid around £52,000 a year in income tax and national insurance, according to the Mirror.

But paying herself via a company would have allowed her to cut this to as little as £29,800, making a tax saving of up to £22,000 a year, the paper claims.

These are based on figures to 2008, when the company changed the type of return it sent to Companies House.

Last year Mr Oliver quit as Paya's secretary after details of the company emerged, not long after Mr Cameron's previous spin doctor and former News of the World editor Andy Coulson resigned over the hacking scandal.

Mr Oliver was also in the news last 
month after he was filmed giving BBC political correspondent Norman 
Smith a dressing down over his coverage of the Leveson Inquiry.

A source close to Mr Oliver told MailOnline today: ‘There was never any tax saving motive. It was a condition of employment by the BBC.

‘Joanna does not have a staff job and
as a freelance presenter you are told to make this arrangement. 
Freelance presenters do not got maternity pay or pension benefits or 
sick pay.

‘Claims about the benefits have been wildly exaggerated.’

The
BBC was last month under intense pressure to reveal how many of its 
stars are channelling their pay through private companies.

MPs
accused the corporation of paying senior figures ‘off-payroll’ – 
meaning they can potentially cut their tax bills by thousands of pounds a
year.

Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed that more than 2,400 civil servants have been paid through a private company.

This means they can pay the corporation tax rate of 21 per cent, rather than higher rates of income tax.

But, to the fury of MPs, he said he was unable to provide similar information about public servants who work for local councils and the BBC, because they are not controlled by central government.

The corporation has said it pays ‘up to 3,000’ actors, editors, make-up artists and other ‘craft staff’ through service companies. Of these, 36 earn more than £100,000.

But it refused to reveal how many top presenters and other talent are paid this way.

In the past it has been reported that household names including Newsnight presenters Jeremy Paxman, Emily Maitlis and Gavin Esler as well as BBC News stars Sophie Raworth and Fiona Bruce have set up companies to channel their earnings, because they are on freelance contracts.

This allows some high profile presenters to off-set expenses against tax, therefore dramatically boosting their net income. The corporation flatly refuses to give concrete numbers of those paid in this way, saying it was ‘commercially sensitive’ and would breach data protection laws.

Mr Alexander told MPs: ‘The review could not include either local government or the BBC, who are not under the direct control of central government.'

Mr Oliver is away in Mexico with the PM and declined to comment but a source close to him said his wife had not made huge savings from the company.

A BBC spokesman said: 'There is no fixed rule that requires presenters to be self-employed. It wil depend on her role. But if they are then the BBC requires them to do this through a service company. This is in order to ensure they are responsible for their tax affairs. It is not done to avoid tax.'
