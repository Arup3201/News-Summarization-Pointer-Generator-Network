The Iraqi man who was shot dead in Dallas while photographing his first ever snowfall had arrived just three weeks prior after saving up for a year, his devastated family has revealed.

Ahmed Al-Jumaili, 36, was fatally shot as he played in the snow with his wife and brother-in-law at their apartment complex last Wednesday. Police have not yet arrested any suspects.

Al-Jumaili had married his wife Zahraa Altaie just a month before she left Iraq for Texas and Al-Jumaili had saved for more than a year to be able to afford to join her, CBS News reported.

Fearful of terrorist activity in their country, he worked hard providing Internet connections to Iraqi homes so he could head to America, according to his father-in-law Mohammed Altaae.

Devastated: His father-in-law Mohammed Altaae wept as he described how the young couple had just wanted to start building their life together after more than a year apart and have children together

His wife had moved to the Dallas area to be near family members and her husband joined her just 20 days before he was murdered. He had a car and was looking for a job, his father-in-law said.

'For a young man and a young woman, oh God, so many dreams together,' Altaae told CBS. 'They wanted to have children and educate them well. It was the dreams of young people.

'We're looking for safe place... What he got was a bullet in his heart.' 

Authorities have released surveillance footage showing four men in their 20s walking from the complex on Wednesday but so far no arrests have been made.

Police do not yet know if Al-Jumaili was targeted or was the victim of random gunfire.

Dallas police Major Jeff Cotner said two of the four wanted men were armed and, without exchanging any words with the group, fired bullets across the complex.

Alia Salem, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) in the Dallas and Fort Worth area, explained in an account on Facebook that Al-Jumaili had taken cover behind a pickup truck when the men opened fire - but a bullet pierced the truck and struck him. 

Al-Jumaili was shot in the chest and rushed to hospital, where he passed away the following day. 

'There was nothing said to Ahmed or his wife and her brother by the perpetrators in advance of the shots,' Salem wrote. 'Including no verbal insults or derogatory slurs.' 

In security footage that captured the men, one appears to be carrying a firearm by his side. 

They are seen running separately through the snow. 

Cotner told CBS that while it does not appear the shooting was a hate crime, it is a possibility they are investigating, among others. 

Look familiar? Police in Dallas have released this security footage of potential suspects in the shooting

Possible involved: Witnesses previously reported seeing four male suspects aged in their 20s enter the gates of the Walnut Bend Apartments complex. Men fitting the description were captured on nearby cameras

A LaunchGood fundraising page explains Al-Jumaili and Zahara married just 16 months ago, and planned to move to the U.S., seeking refuge from the Islamic State.

The neighborhood where Al-Jumaili was killed has a large immigration population and northern Dallas is home to a large number of Iraqi refugees. 

The fundraiser has raised more than $29,000 toward Al-Jumaili's memorial and family fund. 

North Texas Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of $5,000 for information leading to an arrest or indictment.

Salem said the Council on American-Islamic Relations has raised an additional $7,000 reward for information to help in the investigation into the killing.
