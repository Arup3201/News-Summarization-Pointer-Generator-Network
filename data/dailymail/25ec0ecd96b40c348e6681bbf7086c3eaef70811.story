A baby has been pulled alive from the wreckage of a five storey building that collapsed in India's financial capital of Mumbai this morning.

Hundreds of onlookers cheered as rescuers brought the tiny child out of a tunnel in the rubble.

Rescue workers are still trying to reach dozens of people who could be trapped in the debris of the residential building - some of whom can reportedly be heard calling for help.

Up to 90 people are feared dead - with the bodies of three people having been recovered already.

Twenty five people have been pulled alive from the rubble so far.

The building, which is reportedly owned by Mumbai's municipal authority, is believed to home up to 22 families. It crumbled just after 6am near Dockyard Road in the city's south-east.

Crowds have gathered near the rubble of the flattened building - with many people desperately waiting to hear news of loved ones.

Dozens of firefighters and other emergency personnel have been on scene, with ambulances waiting to take survivors to hospital.

'Approximately 80 to 90 people are believed to be left behind in the building and trapped,' said Alok Awasthi, local commander of the National Disaster Response Force.

It is the latest of several Mumbai building collapses this year - with such incidents becoming relatively common across India.

Huge demand for housing around India's fast-growing cities combined with 
pervasive corruption is believed to have resulted in builders cutting corners by using 
substandard materials or adding unauthorized floors.

In April, at least 72 people died when an illegally constructed building fell down on the outskirts of the city.Â

And two months later, at least 10 people, including five children, died in when a three-story building collapsed in the city.

The second most deadly structural failure in 
modern times after 9/11 remains to be the collapse of Rana Plaza factory building in Bangladesh in April - which claimed the lives of 1,129 people.

Thousands of workers were inside the eight-storey building, which housed five garment factories, when it collapsed into rubble near the capital of Dhaka.

It was later reported that survivors were forced to have their limbs amputated without anaesthetic by amateur first-aiders so they could be pulled from the rubble.

In the wake of the Rana Plaza disaster, the country has been under extreme pressure from Western brands to improve safety.

Bangladesh's government and garment manufacturers are campaigning to close dangerous factories and to make safety a priority for the country's most valuable export industry.
