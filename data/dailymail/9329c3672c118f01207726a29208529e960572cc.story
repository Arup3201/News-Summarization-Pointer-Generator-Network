If you’re seriously concerned about the world ending on Friday, then this could be just the ticket.

Ron Hubbard has built a luxurious underground bomb-proof shelter in Montebello, California, with a leather sofa, plasma TV and wooden flooring - just in case the Mayans’ predictions come true.

The civilisation’s Long Count calendar which began 5,125 years ago in 3113 B.C. ends on December 21, 2012 - sparking fears among a small group of people that a major catastrophe could happen.

Bomb-proof: Children test out the bunk beds in the underground survival shelter in Montebello, California

Going underground: The luxurious bomb, nuclear and chemical weapon-proof bunkers are kitted out with beds, kitchens, flushing toilets and even fireplaces - and sell for an average price of £46,000 based on fittings

Handle: A young girl stands in the bunker, which has a leather sofa, plasma TV and wooden flooring

Mr Hubbard manufactures hi-tech 
underground ‘recreational bomb shelters’ - and 
has seen his business boom from selling one a month to one a day in the 
past year.

Inscriptions in Mexico refer to Bolon Yokte - a god associated with war and the underworld - 'descending from the sky' at the end of a 13th period of 400 years on December 21 2012.

But many Mayan experts believe the ‘apocalypse’ concept is a false interpretation of their 5,125-year Long Count cycle as Friday simply marks the start of a new calendar.

The luxurious bomb, nuclear and 
chemical weapon-proof bunkers are kitted out with beds, kitchens, 
flushing toilets and even fireplaces - and sell for an average price of 
£46,000.

Mr Hubbard revealed that he is 
currently rushing the instalment of two shelters - one in New York and 
another in Indiana - in time for the potential Doomsday anticipated by 
some people this Friday.

He said: ‘I will be heading into my 
shelter on December 21 just because I have one and if any of the 
astrophysicists are right, I would feel really stupid.

Tidy: The 500 sq ft cylindrical shelters - produced in California - each measure 10ft in diameter and 50ft long

Home comforts: A bed is prepared in the shelter with the Texas flag on the pillows and duvet cover

Practical: The bunkers have escape tunnels with one sided hatches which can only open from the inside, as well as sealed contamination rooms between the entrance and living areas

‘I've sold shelters to astrophysicists
 who believe there is a possibility that we could be hit with a strong 
solar flare or large amounts of radiation.

'I will be heading into my shelter on December 21 just because I have one and if any of the astrophysicists are right, I would feel really stupid'

‘I'll spend three days underground in 
the shelter just to be safe. If you have a shelter you might as well go 
in it. I don't think anything will happen but you never know.’

The 500 sq ft cylindrical shelters - produced at Mr Hubbard’s based in California - each measure 10ft in diameter and 50ft long.

They have escape tunnels with one 
sided hatches which can only open from the inside, as well as sealed 
contamination rooms between the entrance and living areas.

But they have proved popular not just with those preparing for armageddon, but hunters too.

Installation: The chambers are mean to be installed 20 feet underground - offering comfort as the world falls apart around you

Relax in comfort: A leather sofa and basins can be found inside the Doomsday underground bunker

Space optimization: There are a range of shelters for sale- this one being cheaper than the luxury edition

Mr Hubbard said: ‘I started making 
them because I wanted one for myself, but didn't want to pay $1million (£600,000) to $2million (£1.2million) for them.

'I'll spend three days underground in the shelter just to be safe. If you have a shelter you might as well go in it. I don't think anything will happen but you never know'

Ron Hubbard, shelter manufacturer

‘We get a lot of people who buy the 
shelters as a form of insurance for the worst case scenario. Just like 
someone would buy fire insurance in case their home suffers a fire.

‘We have gone from selling one a month to one a day in the past year since Obama's re-election.

‘Many people are afraid of economic meltdown, others simply want to have one just in case something catastrophic does happen.

‘People love them. They make a very 
nice hunting cabin or weekend retreat, so they don't just have to sit 
there waiting for a catastrophe.’

Creature comforts: The small dining area with an ornament on the side is reminiscent of a table at a diner

Home made: There is a mini fridge and microwave in the shelter but little other space for food preparation

Tight quarters: Visitors likened the California shelter to a studio apartment when they looked around

CCTV with a view of the world upstairs: Add a few trinkets and posters and you have a home from home
