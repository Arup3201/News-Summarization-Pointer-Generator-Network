Battlelines have been drawn for the only major TV debate of the election campaign, when seven party leaders will go head-to-head in a two-hour marathon.

Tory leader David Cameron, Labour's Ed Miliband and Lib Dem Nick Clegg will share a platform with Ukip's Nigel Farage, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, the Green Party's Natalie Bennett and Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood.

Strict rules released by broadcaster ITV for Thursday's night's event spell out in minute detail who will speak when, and for how long, with host Julie Etchingham trying to keep order.

From left to right the line up will be: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative).

Lots have been drawn to decide the order in which each leader will speak, including the opening and closing statements and giving one-minute answers to the four studio audience questions

Lots have been drawn to agree where each of the leaders will stand and when they get to speak.

The agreed line up behind the podiums will be, from left to right: Natalie Bennett (Green), Nick Clegg (Lib Dem), Nigel Farage (Ukip), Ed Miliband (Labour), Leanne Wood (Plaid Cymru), Nicola Sturgeon (SNP) and David Cameron (Conservative).

Names drawn out of a hat also helped to decide who will get to speak first, with Ms Bennett opening proceedings and Mr Cameron having the final word by giving the last closing remarks.  

The two-hour live debate will be be screened from 8pm to 10pm on Thursday night.

Each leader will give an opening statement to a studio audience of around 200 people.

They will then be allowed to deliver an uninterrupted one-minute answer to each question, before 18 minutes of debate on each question. There will be just four 'substantial election questions' covered during the night. 

Each leader will then give a closing statement to the cameras, before the programme ends at 10pm.

The seven-way debate is a long way from the 2010 contest, when Mr Clegg and Mr Cameron went up against Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown

Mr Cameron will speak last, enabling him to have the last word. He is likely to repeat his refrain that a vote for anything other than a Tory majority will mean 'chaos'.

Producers insist that the leaders will not see the questions in advance and an 'experienced editorial panel' will select them.

Polling company ICM has chosen the 'politically-balanced' audience, with around 20 per cent said to be undecided voters.

During the entire two-hour programme there will be just one advert break, a highly unusual move for Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster.

The live programme is the only debate involving all of the main leaders scheduled for the campaign, after months of protracted negotiations between broadcasters and the parties.

Mr Clegg, who emerged as the surprise winner of the 2010 debates, today said he was spending less time preparing for the contest this time.

'I'm not spending nearly as much time trying to think through every twist and turn, I'm not preparing nearly quite as methodically as last time,' he told reporters on his bright yellow battlebus.

'The longer I've been in politics the more I think you can over-think these things. And it will be very different - there'll be seven of us.

'The last time nobody knew who I was, so I had nothing to lose. In a sense this time I dont have much to lose either, as everyone appears to have their mind made up one way or the other.

'I'm not going to triumph in these debates - that's just self-evident. What I learnt about the debates with Farage is you might marshal the best arguments but if there are people who play better to the gallery they are going to do well.

'I've been in politics long enough to know its not a beauty contest and it tends to be the case that newcomers or people not well known to the public tend to do best, so I enter with quite sober realistic expectations. But I intend to enjoy it.

'I'm not disillusioned, I think you just have to keep what debates can and cant do in perspective.'

Mr Farage said he was disappointed to be placed near the middle of the line-up for the debates, rather than near Mr Cameron.

Speaking on a visit to the Coastguard pub, close to the White Cliffs of Dover, Mr Farage said: 'I'm disappointed that Mr Cameron is so far away from me but we'll make the best of it.' 

In the run-up to the 2010 election there were three debates, in which Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg took on Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown.

However, other parties including Ukip and the Greens demanded a slot, while Mr Cameron refused to take part in several debates once the campaign got underway.

Labour have accused the Tory leader of being 'chicken' for refusing to go up against Mr Miliband.

On April 16 the BBC will host a 'challengers debate' with only the leaders of opposition parties including Labour, Ukip, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru.

Then on April 30 there will be a special of BBC's Question Time, with Mr Cameron, Mr Miliband and Mr Clegg appearing separately to answer questions from a studio audience.
