When Fusilier Lee Rigby was murdered, Emma Kirkwood offered his grieving widow Rebecca a shoulder to cry on.

But she claims 31-year-old  Mrs Rigby has repaid her kindness by running off with her  soldier husband.

David George, 23, who played the Last Post at Fusilier Rigby’s funeral and wept as he told how badly he would miss his comrade, walked out on their marriage and into the arms of Mrs Rigby.

Lee Rigby's widow Rebecca (right) is now in a relationship with Dummer David George a colleague of Lee's who played Last Post at his funeral

Now Miss Kirkwood, 26, who uses her 
maiden name, has lambasted both her estranged husband and his new 
girlfriend for their betrayal. She has been married to Mr George for two
 years and has a 15-month-old daughter, Lilly-Mae, with him.

She
 said: ‘Rebecca was devastated about what happened to Lee. They were 
apart and he was engaged to someone else, but he was the father of her 
son. I felt a huge sympathy towards her.

‘I
 am hurt and angry. Having been left to raise Jack on her own, I 
wouldn’t have expected her to place me – someone who had been kind to 
her – in a similar position.’ Fusilier Rigby, 25, was murdered in the 
street close to his barracks in Woolwich, South London, last May by 
Islamic fanatics Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale who are 
awaiting sentence.

Miss 
Kirkwood said she had offered sympathy and support when Mrs Rigby 
visited her and her husband in Cyprus. ‘Around three months after Lee’s 
murder, Rebecca came to Cyprus where David and I were based,’ she told 
the Sunday Mirror.

‘One evening she arrived at our house with a friend. Rebecca broke down and poured her heart out.

However David was already married to Rebecca's friend Emma Kirkwood. He has now left her and their 15-month-old daughter Lilly Mae in order to start his new life

David (centre) - who appeared weeping on TV after Lee's killing - abandoned another of his wives in order to start a relationship with Emma in 2009

‘She
 said she loved Lee and that they had been about to get back together. I
 had no idea whether that was true, but I tried to comfort her as best I
 could. To start a relationship with my husband within weeks of that 
night is devastating.’ On their return to the UK Mr George moved out and
 stopped answering his phone and emails.

Miss
 Kirkwood heard rumours he had been seeing Mrs Rigby and confronted him 
during a meeting in London. She said: ‘I looked at him as he held our 
daughter and asked if he was seeing Rebecca.

‘He
 looked me in the eye and swore on Lilly-Mae’s life that he hadn’t seen 
her for weeks. I knew he was lying. That’s the last either of us has 
seen of him.’

Miss Kirkwood 
said she also confronted Mrs Rigby who flatly denied an affair. But her 
fears were confirmed last week when the couple were pictured together 
shopping in Halifax.

Lee was murdered in a street in Woolwich in May last year by Michael Adobolajo, 28 (left) and Michael Adebowale, 22 (right), who will be sentenced later this month

She 
said that when she first got together with Mr George he had claimed to 
be single, but was actually married with a son. Miss Kirkwood added: 
‘His first wife will be laughing at me now, thinking I deserve this, but
 if I’d known he was married in the first place he’d never have got near
 me.

‘At 23, he’s left two 
wives and two of his own children behind. As well as thinking about what
 they’re doing to my family, Rebecca might want to think about his track
 record for her own sake and her son’s.’

No one was in to comment at Mrs Rigby’s home in Halifax.
