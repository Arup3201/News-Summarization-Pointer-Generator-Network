The music mogul decided to make the donation to end a legal battle with the charity over an all-girl act which appeared on the X-Factor.

Mr Cowell - the show's executive producer was involved in a dispute with the charity Rhythmix after one of the girl groups on the show took the same name.

The Brighton-based charity, which has been operating in Kent, Surrey and Sussex for 10 years, helps disabled and vulnerable young people through music.

The charity had protested when its name was copied by the all-girl group on the ITV programme.

The actual sum of the donation remains a secret but it is understood that it will be more than the £20,000 legal costs the charity has incurred in a legal fight to protect its trademark according to the Independent on Sunday. 

The charity took legal action against Mr Cowell's company, SyCo after he made an attempt to trademark the name for the group.

A host of celebrities including Stephen Fry, Armando Iannucci and Alistair McGowan backed the charity's cause.

SyCo withdrew the application to trademark the name earlier this month but the charity was still faced with huge legal costs.

The agreement was reached on Friday between Rhythmix's chief executive, Mark Davyd, and Cowell's company SyCo, through the PR agent Max Clifford.

The girl group was also renamed Little Mix.

The charity's chief executive Mark Davyd told The Independent on Sunday: 'We are very pleased this has been brought to an amicable conclusion.

'These are difficult times for charities, and we are very pleased that we have been able to reach an agreement with SyCo to put this matter behind us.'

Fry praised the deal on Twitter yesterday, saying: 'Hurrah. Simon Cowell's company did the decent thing and came to a satisfactory arrangement with the charity Rhythmix about their name.'

The charity is now preparing to go into an other battle - this time with the Education Secretary over plans for music provision in schools.

The Independent on Sunday reported that publication of the Government's national music plan has been delayed amid a row over ring-fencing funding.

Campaigners want music education to remain protected and are pressing for greater support for children with special educational needs and those described as gifted.

Mr Davyd said that ministers must acknowledge the link between this summer's riots and the closure of youth centres when planning music provision.
