The world's most expensive footballer has pulled a pair of pants over his £85million head to join a legion of celebrities backing a campaign to find a bone marrow donor for an eight-year-old-girl.

Real Madrid star Gareth Bale smiled, white boxers on his head, in a bid to help a schoolgirl desperately in need of a life-changing transplant.

Hollie Clark was diagnosed with the rare condition, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) two months ago, leaving her reliant on regular blood transfusions.

To help find a suitable donor her family, who live in Cardiff, launched a social 
media campaign calling on people to take a picture with their pants on
 their head, posting the photo alongisde the hashtag #pantsonyourhead.

Hollie Clark, 8, (pictured with her uncle Matthew) has been diagnosed with a rare bone marrow syndrome. Her family has launched a social media campaign to help find Hollie a bone marrow donor

The campaign, started by Hollie's parents Laura and Stephen, pictured with Hollie and her brother Sam, was inspired by her uncle Matthew. He put his underwear on his head to make his niece laugh while she was in hospital prompting the idea to raise money for the Anthony Nolan Trust

Yesterday, Bale, 24, became the most famous face to join the search for a donor.

A
 host of stars, including Russell Howard, Welsh rugby player Sam 
Warburton and rugby commentator Jonathan Davies have all posted selfies 
to ask people to sign up to become bone marrow donors.

Bale
 posted a picture of himself on Twitter sporting a pair of white pants 
on his head with the ‘register@anthonynolan.org’ message stitched into 
the elasticated waist.

The Welsh striker tweeted: ‘Hollie is in need of a bone marrow transplant, please RT! £pantsonyourhead @HelpHollie @HolliesParents.’

The campaign was launched earlier this 
month by Hollie’s family and her mother, Laura, said there has been a 
2,580 per cent increase in the number of donors signing up in the weeks 
since the appeal began.

Hollie was diagnosed with MDS – a blood disorder which causes a drop in the number of healthy blood cells in the body - in April this year after developing unusual bruising. 

Her mother took her to their doctor who ran tests and sent Hollie straight to hospital, where she was diagnosed.

'It was an absolute shock, it is literally the worst thing as a parent you could be told,' said Mrs Clark, a GP.

'It was hard to believe because she’d been so active at the time - she loves swimming and cycling and playing with her friends, and she’d been doing all these things without us even knowing that her haemoglobin levels were dangerously low.'

Hollie relies on regular blood transfusions until a suitable bone marrow donor can be found and it is hoped that the social media campaign will help find a suitable donor. Cyclist Geraint Thomas shows his support

2,580 per cent increase in the number of donors signing up in the weeks 
since the appeal began. Rugby player Shane Williams (pictured left) and TV presenter Gethin Jones (right) have lent support to the campaign

The family came up with the idea for the #pantsonyourhead campaign while Hollie was in a hospital bed following her first treatment.

‘At the time the only way some of our family could communicate with her was by using FaceTime videos on their phones,’ Mrs Clark said.

'It has been absolutely amazing. We have not got a match yet, but right from the start we said it was about finding a match and raising awareness, and we have definitely done that'

‘Her uncle, Matthew put his underwear on his head to make her laugh while he was talking to her on FaceTime and it sparked an idea for a way we could raise awareness about Anthony Nolan in a way that's fun and personal to Hollie.

‘We are reaching out, and every single person in the public can help.

'If they are too old to donate bone marrow they can still donate blood.

‘It has been absolutely amazing. We 
have not got a match yet, but right from the start we said it was about 
finding a match and about raising awareness and we have definitely done 
that.

‘We would love to personally thank everyone.’

Hollie was diagnosed with a rare bone marrow failure syndrome two months ago and needs a transplant. The social media campign to find her a donor is supported by Welsh sporting stars, including Sam Warburton - and his dog Ledley

Hollie's family have asked people aged from 16 to 30 years of age to register with the Anthony Nolan trust and stars including Fresh Meat actress Kimberley Nixon (pictured left) and rugby commentator Jonathan Davies (right) have joined in on Twitter

Hollie's family has asked people aged from 16 to and 30 to register with Anthony Nolan.

Karen Archer, Regional Register Development Manager at Anthony Nolan said: ‘The “pants on your head selfie” idea has really taken off and is making a big difference in terms of the numbers joining the register.

‘The support of sportspeople like Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton is particularly invaluable in helping us reach young men - which is really important as they are most likely to be chosen to donate but only represent 14 per cent of the register.’
