Twitter dug its heels in yesterday after French prosecutors demanded the details of users who have posted racist or anti-Semitic comments.

In what could prove a significant test case for the micro-blogging site, lawyer Alexandre Neri argued that the company is only subject to US law and only a judge in America could force it to release the information.

In October, Jewish student bodies asked 
Twitter to remove a number of messages which appeared under the hashtag 
#unbonjuif (#agoodjew), with some users posting examples such as: ‘#agoodjew is a
 dead Jew.’

Offensive: A French court has ordered Twitter to hand over the identities of racist and anti-Semitic users after the hashtag #unbonjuif (#agoodjew) went viral in France last year

The hashtag became the third most popular in France, with 
thousands attacking the religion.

France has a number of strict laws aimed at combating hate crimes.

The Union of Jewish Students of France 
(UEJF) and three other similar groups took Twitter to a French court asking them to hand over the 
names of all those responsible so they can be prosecuted.

'Because it does not take the necessary measures to identify where the tweets come from, Twitter is offering a platform to racism and anti-Semitism,' said Jonathan Hayoun, the president of the Union of French Jewish Students (UEJF), in a statement on Monday.

But Mr Neri told the Tribunal de Grande Instance in Paris that Twitter 
‘data is collected and stored in the United States’ – namely in San 
Francisco, where the site is based.

‘Should I submit myself to the law of a different country to where I work?' he asked.

He added that the differences between French and US laws on freedom of speech have created a ‘huge void, a question mark’.

Stephane Lilti, counsel for the Jewish groups, suggested Twitter had  a ‘commercial interest’ in protecting the anonymity of its users.

‘Twitter is playing a commercial game by raising a number of legal hurdles to not having to comply with its legal obligations,’ he told the court.

Judge Anne-Marie Sauteraud will hand down a verdict on January 24.

French ministers Fleur Pellerin and Najat Vallaud-Belkacem have said they will speak to Twitter executives about the controversy by phone this week.

Last year Twitter shut down an account run by a German neo-Nazi group based in Hanover, following a request by German police. Facebook and YouTube complied with similar requests.

A spokesman for Twitter said it always suspends accounts when they are illegal, or in breach of its rules, but would not hand over details of account holders unless ordered by a judge.
