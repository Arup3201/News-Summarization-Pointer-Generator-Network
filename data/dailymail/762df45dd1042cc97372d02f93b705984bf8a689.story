Croatia striker Andrej Kramaric's move to Leicester City has moved a step closer after the Football Association backed his work permit application.

The 23-year-old, understood to have cost City £9.5million from Rijeka, has agreed personal terms on a three-and-a-half-year deal that can only be signed once the permit has been granted.

Kramaric's lack of international experience, with only four caps to his name, meant a permit was not automatically granted.

But having played for Croatia from under-14 through to under-21 level and recently broken into the senior squad and scored goals, victory on appeal is likely - especially with the FA's backing.

A club statement read: 'Leicester City Football Club has today (Monday) received a Governing Body Endorsement from the Football Association to support the work permit application of Andrej Kramaric.

'The FA endorsement allows the club to apply for clearance from the UK Border Agency. Once a work permit is granted, Andrej's move to Leicester City from Croatian side HNK Rijeka will be made official.'
