The mother of a British jihadist who was jailed for 12 years for going to Syria to join a group linked to Al-Qaeda says she was betrayed by the police and courts over her son's long prison sentence.

Yusuf Sarwar, a student from Birmingham, left a note telling his mother he had gone to Syria  fight against 'Allah's enemies' in May last year.

His mother Majida Sarwar showed the note to the police, and her son, who travelled to the war zone to join Islamic extremists with former postal worker Mohammed Ahmed, was arrested on his return this January.

At her son's court case, a judge praised 'brave' Ms Sarwar for telling the authorities about his plans, but now she says she was betrayed by the legal system.

Speaking to the Observer, Ms Sarwar said: 'This is not justice. They said I was doing the right thing, that when my son came back they would try to help, but this terrible sentence – all they have done was to set me against my son.

'The police say "mothers come forward", you can trust us, we will help. But now they will see what happened to my son. What kind of person would go to the police if they think their son will get 12 years in prison? Nobody wants to do that. I did not want that.

'My husband just sits silently most of the time, crying a lot.' 

The family were told that the 22-year-old, whose grandfather served with the British Army, might expect a two-year sentence, they said.

Ms Sawar said her son wanted to come home and that she would have met him in Turkey but was warned not to by the Foreign Office and the police.

'My son is not a terrorist, he didn’t make bombs, he didn’t kill anyone, he tried to help. He did a stupid thing and when he realised this he wanted to come home,' she said. 

Sarwar left a scribbled letter for his mother when he fled for Syria, but she went to the police who intercepted him and his friend Ahmed when they flew back to Britain eight months later.

It read: 'Make sure you don't get any authority involved its (sic) a kuffar (infidel) government.

'I will try to intercede for you but don't rely on my intercession for if Allah allows me to intercede make sure to perfect yourselfs (sic).

'Make sure to keep me in your dua (prayers) as I am doing the best deed in Allahs eyes in'shaa' Allah.

'I will be going to Sumya (Syria) Ash sham which I will help the oppressed and fight Allahs enemies there.

'Taliban, Al Quada (sic) etc are not bad the West portrays them as bad.

'The group I will be joining is Kataib Al Muhajireen which is part of Al Nusra. In 'shaa' Allah

'WE WOULD STAND UP AND NEVER WOULD LET ALLAHS RELIGION BE DEMONISED'

On Friday, Woolwich Crown Court heard the pair ordered books Islam For Dummies, The Koran For Dummies and Arabic For Dummies from Amazon ahead of their trip.

Ahmed also told his childhood friend Sarwar: 'I cannot tell anyone I'm going to do jihad. Lol. I'll get arrested' just before they left Birmingham and joined rebels in Aleppo. 

The men were arrested on their return to the UK and pleaded guilty to one count of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorism acts contrary to Section 5 of the Terrorism Act. 

Judge Michael Topolski QC said: 'They willingly, enthusiastically and with a great deal of purpose, persistence and determination embarked on a course intended to commit acts of terrorism.'

After eight months fighting in Syria, they were arrested on at Heathrow Airport in January because their worried families  tipped off counter-terrorism detectives. 

The judge said they believed in 'violent Islamist extremism' and praised the 'extraordinarily brave' mother who reported her  son to the police.

Prosecutor Brian Altman QC said: 'Without the mother's actions, the police would not have been in a position to be waiting for the men on their return.' 

The judge said they had made a careful plan 'to join the ranks of the Islamist forces', adding 'before travelling, you both went to some trouble to fabricate cover-stories'.

The judge said both men 'intended to be martyred on the battlefield in Syria' and plotted 'to attack Assad's forces, with the obvious risk that these intended attacks may have resulted in both military and civilian losses'.

He also discussed a note written from Sarwar to his mother, which hailed the Taliban.

'Its contents provide an insight into the true purpose of your journey.

'This was not a spontaneous response to travel to a humanitarian crisis. Without any doubt, it shows you were travelling to Syria intent on jihad'.

He said the sentences were designed to 'punish, deter and incapacitate' and 'both of these defendants are fundamentalists who became interested in and then deeply committed to violent extremism'.

He said he could not be sure the defendants planned to launch attacks in Britain, but noted 'the retention of the disk, containing detailed instructions of how to make an IED, is a deeply disturbing feature'. 

He handed both men a jail term of 12 years and 8 months, to be followed by five years on extended license. They will be also be subject to counter-terror notification requirements for 30 years. 

The court heard the men fled to Syria claiming it was a university trip elsewhere but after returning to Britain they told officers they had been doing humanitarian work but a camera containing 'thousands' of images, including some of them posing with guns on the front line, was found in their luggage.

Traces of 'military-grade explosives', including TNT and nitro-glycerine were on the men's clothes and trainers.

Sarwar's family reported him missing to police in May last year after they found a hand-written letter from him in which said he had left to join a terrorist group called Kataib al Muhajireen (KaM) - later renamed Kateeba al-Kawthar - 'to do jihad'.

Officers also found social media and email conversations between the pair and Islamic extremists.

Over Skype, Ahmed talked to a Swedish national who was fighting with KaM.

He told the fighter: 'I come to join KaM,' to which the Swede replies: 'Inshallah (God willing)'.

Ahmed later asked a Danish Islamic extremist: 'Would the brothers in Yemen accept me?' 

The families of both men had put pressure on them to return to the UK once they discovered where they were. 

Days earlier he had told his family he was travelling to Turkey as part of a two-week trip organised by Birmingham City University, where he was a part-time computer science student.

It prompted a search of the men's homes, which revealed an online conversation between Ahmed and a Swedish national fighting with the KaM, during which Ahmed said he wanted to join the terrorist group.

West Midlands Police said the men showed the mind-set to go and join the jihad in Syria, before carrying out research, buying equipment, and finally travelling their via Turkey.

Ahmed, who was born in Bangladesh, moved to Britain as a child, while Sarwar, who is of Pakistani descent, was born in Britain.

An initial search of their homes revealed images of Islamic propaganda on both of their computers, including images of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isis) flags, shaheed (martyr) literature and several texts which are linked to the jihadi mindset.
