President Barack Obama is 'the most racist president' in U.S. history, according to Ferris Bueller's Day Off actor Ben Stein.

The actor and economist, famous for his scene in the 1986 movie in which he monotonously repeats the name 'Bueller' during a painfully dull economics class, said President Obama was 'racist' because of White House attempts to 'racialize' voting.

His attack on President Obama was launched during a discussion on the importance of the issue of the U.S. economy for midterm voters.

He told Fox News: 'This president is the most racist president there has ever been in America, he is purposely trying to use race to divide Americans.

'What the White House is doing is trying to racialize class politics.

'And they're especially trying to tell the African American voter that the GOP is against letting them have a chance at a good life in this economy, and that is just a complete lie.'

Meanwhile, results show the Democrats received a shellacking in the midterms, with Republicans consolidating their power on Capitol Hill by picking up more seats than needed to gain control of the U.S. Senate.

Their victories included key wins in Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, North Carolina and Iowa - all seats controlled by Democrats when the day began.

The Republican National Committee (RNC) took a massive victory lap after the North Carolina race's outcome was no longer in doubt.

'The American people have put their trust in the Republican Party, sending a GOP majority to the U.S. Senate,' said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus.

'Our party's principles and message resonated with voters across the country. This was a rejection of President Obama's failed polices and Harry Reid's dysfunctional Senate.'

'Republicans have been given the opportunity to lead the country in a better direction, and the Republican House and Senate are ready to listen to the American people. We hope President Obama will too.'

'It's time to get to work on creating jobs, expanding American energy development, pursuing real healthcare reform, reducing spending, reining in the federal government, and keeping America safe.'
