The embattled mayor of Toronto has admitted to getting 'professional help' for his emotional problems, but still insists he isn't an addict and doesn't need drug treatment.

Rob Ford made a very public appearance today at a Canadian Football League playoff game to cheer on the Toronto Argonauts - despite the CFL commissioner's pleas that he stay away from the game.

The Toronto city council voted Friday to strip the mayor of some of his powers. That effort will continue Monday when the council moves to deny Ford most of his remaining powers, including his office budget. It would also appoint the deputy mayor to lead his executive committee.

Ford went on Fox News to again apologize for smoking crack cocaine and having 'outbursts.'

'I have admitted to using illegal drugs in the last year, OK? I’ve admitted to drinking too much, OK? so I’m dealing with it. I am training every day. I’m in the gym for two hours every day. I’m seeking professional help,' he said.

'I’m not an alcoholic. I’m not a drug addict.'

Ford has remained defiant despite an increasingly-embarrassing list of public statements and admissions about bad behavior.

Most recently, he made crude comments about his sex life with his wife - while she was standing with him. He was attempting to dismiss allegations that he had propositioned a female staffer for oral sex.

He was wearing a jersey for his beloved Toronto Argonauts at the time - a custom shirt that reads 'Major Ford' on the back.

That prompted Argonauts CEO Chris Rudge to call Ford's ongoing calamities 'an unfortunate situation for the city.' CFL Commissioner Mark Cohon asked that Ford to stay away from Sunday's Eastern 
Conference final between the Toronto Argonauts and Hamilton Tiger-Cats.

He ignored the calls and Sunday afternoon, shortly after halftime, he took a seat a seat about 20 rows back from the field.

His arrival caused a stir in Section 129 of the Rogers Centre, with fans clogging the aisle as they snapped photos and exchanged handshakes with the mayor who recently has acknowledged smoking crack cocaine and drinking excessively.

Wearing a dark blue Argonauts jersey with 'Mayor Ford' and the number 12 across the back, Ford laughed and drew cheers as he held aloft a crudely constructed replica of the Grey Cup, Canadian football's championship trophy.

Outside the downtown stadium before kickoff, fans of both teams said Ford should stay away from the game.

'He needs to take some time off and get help,' said Bob Walker, dressed in an Argonauts baseball cap and jacket.

'It's definitely a distraction... He means well, he's done well for the city. It's just, it's enough, you know? We need to get on with the city and take his business somewhere else for a bit.'

Hamilton fan Shawn Kowalyshyn, wearing a Tiger-Cats jersey, said the mayor has 'embarrassed' himself and his family.

'Unfortunately, I'd like to support him and his policies, but he's just gone too far over the top. ... It's gotten too ridiculous,' Kowalyshyn said.

Brothers Kyle and Matt O'Connor of Hamilton held up a hand-lettered sign reading 'Our Mayor Doesn't Smoke Crack!!' as they lined up to wait for stadium gates to open.

Earlier Sunday, the 44-year-old Ford was spotted outside the downtown studios of the tabloid Sun News Network, where he and brother Doug, a Toronto city councilor, were taping the first episode of their new current events television show, 'Ford Nation,' which is to air Monday night.

Recently released court documents show Ford became the subject of a police investigation after news reports surfaced in May that he had been caught on video smoking crack cocaine. In interviews with police, former staffers accused the mayor of frequently drinking, driving while intoxicated and making sexual advances toward a female staffer.

Ford's erratic behavior was parodied in the opening segment of the U.S. comedy show 'Saturday Night Live,' with cast member Bobby Moynihan portraying the mayor who at one point ducks behind the lectern at a press conference to do a drug deal, exclaiming, 'Wow, that's a lot of crack.'

Ford finally decides he needs to go on a TV show which would believe him, and then is shown being interviewed by CBS '60 Minutes' correspondent Lara Logan (Kate McKinnon) who accepts his denials that he did crack, smoked marijuana and used alcohol.

Logan recently had to apologize on-air for a '60 Minutes' story about the deadly 2012 attack on a U.S. mission in Benghazi, Libya, saying the network could no longer trust the testimony of a former security contractor who had claimed he was present during the attack.
