Hillary Clinton doubts she will ever run for office again - and would love to ‘get a good night’s sleep for a week or two,’ her husband has claimed.

Former U.S. president Bill Clinton said his wife of 36 years - the Secretary of State - is tired from her tough job and really needs some time off.

He also said on a chat show yesterday that he was ‘surprised’ when his daughter Chelsea Clinton was revealed as an NBC News correspondent.

Former president: Bill Clinton told ABC'S 'The View' that his wife of 36 years - the U.S. Secretary of State - is tired from her job and really needs some time off

'(Hillary) wants to stay in one place for two or three days,’ he told ABC’s ‘The View’. ‘She wants to get a good night's sleep for a week or two.’

‘Since we were in law school, she's shied away from politics and putting herself on the line and then she does and she gets committed.'

He said she did not want to run as a Democratic presidential candidate against Barack Obama in 2008 and has no eye on the White House.

'She's tired, she needs some time off,’ he told ABC. ‘I don't know what the future holds. She doesn't think she will ever run for office again.’

He said his wife would like to be doing ‘a lot of this work like I do - except focussed on women and girls’ and he is struggling to keep up with her.

Mr Clinton, 65, also talked about economics and his new book: ‘Back to Work: Why We Need Smart Government for a Strong Economy’.

But he spoke in addition about his daughter Chelsea starting her new job as an NBC correspondent, ahead of her debut next Monday.

'I was surprised but I knew she was thinking about it,’ he told ABC, saying Chelsea is also involved with both Columbia and New York University.

Mrs Clinton has said she only intended to be Secretary of State for a single term, which heightened speculation she might run for president.
