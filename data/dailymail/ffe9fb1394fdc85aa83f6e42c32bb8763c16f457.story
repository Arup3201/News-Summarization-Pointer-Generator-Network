If you're a little squeamish you may not want to watch the video accompanying this column.

It features the most persistently savage treatment I have ever seen a footballer receive on a pitch.

You may hear more of the name Harry Beautyman in the future, but only sheer luck has allowed him to get a move into the Football League and a step up to League One level as he chases his dream of making it in the professional game.

Harry Beautyman has joined League One Peterborough on loan from Conference side Welling United

The 22-year-old technically gifted talent was rejected by Leyton Orient and has had to make his way through non-League football to earn another shot at the big time.

On Monday he made a loan switch from Welling to League One Peterborough United, with the deal set to be made permanent when the transfer window opens in January.

He's a lucky boy – not because he's getting a shot in the League, his performances have earned him that chance with 45 goals in 130 Conference games from midfield.

He's lucky because he was sliced to pieces by brutal, Neanderthal players in Saturday's Conference game, which Welling won 2-1 against Halifax.

When you see the succession of vicious challenges aimed at Beautyman you wonder how he survived without breaking any limbs.

In almost 40 years of watching football at all levels of the game I have never seen a player receive such horrendous treatment. Maybe I am naive, but I didn't think this sort of nasty thuggery still happened on the pitch.

Halifax No 5 Matty Pearson, who was eventually red carded for stamping on Beautyman, actually played for England C – the non-League international side - last month in Turkey. Will the Football Association do anything about his behaviour? He committed most of the fouls shown in the video, which was put together by www.footballcameraman.uk.

Pearson's main aim is clearly to take Beautyman out, he has very little interest in the ball. It's disgusting to watch. The first one sees Pearson's studs aimed at Beautyman's knees. Incredibly the referee didn't even give him a yellow card.

The foul by the corner flag – the third foul on the video - is sickening. A delicious piece of skill sees Beautyman, flying down the right wing, drag the ball back while at full pace. But the defender, Scott McManus, is already sliding in and recklessly takes out Beautyman's standing leg. It's amazing he doesn't break his leg.

McManus, who was convicted of assaulting his girlfriend three years ago - hours after being sent off in an FA Cup tie for violent conduct - appears to lean over the victim as he lies on the ground and say something to him. It's clearly not a question about whether he is feeling OK.

McManus tweeted after the game that he thought it was a fair challenge, and he defended his view by pointing out that the referee didn't even award a free-kick. But for me McManus has no control over his body as he flies full force into Beautyman. He shows no care towards his fellow player.

I think it's a horrible challenge, a potential leg-breaker, and the referee got it badly wrong. But you take a look and decide.

Remarkably Beautyman ends up being booked by clueless referee Adam Bromley for having his own shirt pulled.

I cannot believe this happened this weekend in the fifth tier of English football. Halifax Town, the referee, and in particular Halifax's England C international Pearson should all face consequences for what happened to Beautyman.

Good luck to him in his career, if there is any football justice, his skills will be rewarded with success, not injuries.

As for Halifax, shame on the Shaymen. They were called 'brave' after their narrow FA Cup defeat to Bradford earlier this month. I only saw cowards in Halfiax Town shirts at Welling at the weekend.
