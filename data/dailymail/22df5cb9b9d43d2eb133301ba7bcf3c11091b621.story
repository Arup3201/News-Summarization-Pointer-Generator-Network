Gaby Scanlon drank two shots of Jagermeister laced with liquid nitrogen when she fell ill

A wine bar is being prosecuted after it served a freezing liquid nitrogen cocktail to a teenager who was celebrating her 18th birthday and left her needing her stomach removed.

Gaby Scanlon, from Heysham in Lancashire, drank two shots of the liqueur Jagermeister, which had been laced with the chemical, with friends at Oscar's Wine Bar in Lancaster in October 2012.

But soon after the drink she was doubled over in pain and her friends drove her straight to Lancaster Royal Infirmary where a CT scan found a large perforation. 

The student spent three weeks in hospital as doctors removed her stomach and connected her oesophagus directly to her small bowel.

During a four hour emergency operation they found the extremely low temperature of the liquid nitrogen had burned a hole in her stomach and completely destroyed the stomach lining.

The super-cold chemical creates a dramatic dry-ice effect as it evaporates at room temperature. As a gas it is harmless, but the much colder liquid freezes objects on contact in seconds. 

Today Lancaster City Council announced that court proceedings will take place against the George Street wine bar, one of its directors and an employee.

In a statement the council said: 'Andrew Dunn, of Yorkshire, has been summoned to court to answer charges under sections 3(1), 33(1)(a) and 37 of the Health and Safety at Work Act etc 1974 in relation to his role as a director of Oscar's Wine Bar.

'Matthew George Harding, of Lancaster, has also been summoned to court to answer charges under and breaches of sections 7 and 33(1)(a) of the Health and Safety at Work Act etc 1974 in relation to his role as an employee of Oscar's Wine Bar
