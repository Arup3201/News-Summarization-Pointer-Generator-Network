Climate change scientists warned 
yesterday that the Earth is set for more heatwaves, floods, droughts and
 rising sea levels that could swamp coasts and low-lying islands as 
greenhouse gases build up in the atmosphere.

But
 despite these dire predictions, they admitted global warming is likely 
to be more gradual than they previously thought and that world 
temperatures have barely changed in the past 15 years.

In
 its first report for six years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate 
Change states that global warming is ‘unequivocal’ – and it is ‘95 per 
cent certain’ that human activity is the ‘dominant’ cause.

The IPPC reported revealed that it is 'extremely likely' that human activity is the dominant cause for global warming. It claims a rise in temperature in the Northern Hemisphere (right) will cause snow cover to decrease by 25 per cent by the end of the 21st century. But the report failed to conclusively explain why the rise in global average surface temperatures had largely 'paused' over the past two decades (left)

and subtropical dry regions, mean precipitation will likely decrease from the 1986-2005 period (left)

UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said: ‘The heat is on. Now we must act.’

But
 others questioned the credibility of the predictions, pointing out that
 the IPCC’s research had signally failed to predict the ongoing ‘pause’ 
in rising world temperatures.

Dr Benny Peiser, of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, said: ‘The IPCC has taken a huge gamble.

‘Unless
 global temperatures begin to rise in the next few years, the IPCC is 
very likely going to suffer an existential blow to its credibility.’

The
 36-page summary of the report was released yesterday after four days of
 intense negotiations between officials from 110 countries and 
scientists behind closed doors in Stockholm. It states that each of the 
past three decades has been progressively warmer than any preceding 
decade since 1850 and, in the Northern Hemisphere, 1983 to 2012 is 
likely to have been the warmest 30-year period in the past 1,400 years. 

CO2 concentrations have
increased by 40 per cent since pre-industrial times, primarily from fossil fuel emissions, claims the IPCC. The ocean has absorbed about 30 per cent of the emitted
anthropogenic carbon dioxide, causing ocean acidification

Ocean acidification is determined by a decreases in pH. The pH of ocean surface water has decreased by 0.1 since the beginning of the industrial era, according to the report

It
 also claims that it is ‘extremely likely’ that man is responsible for 
‘more than 50 per cent’ of the temperature rises seen since 1951. But 
the report summary offered little detailed evidence to back up that 
claim.

The most 
controversial part of the 2,000-page report, which will be released in 
full on Monday, is the one that addresses why the rise in global average
 surface temperature has ‘paused’.

The
 report acknowledges that temperature rises have dropped from 0.12c per 
decade since 1951 to just 0.05c per decade since 1998 – despite record 
amounts of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere.

Critics
 say this shows that carbon dioxide is not as damaging as had been 
claimed and several governments called for references to the slowdown to
 be amended or even removed from the report.

In
 fact, the slowdown is acknowledged more prominently than it was in 
draft versions, with the IPCC saying that much of the ‘missing’ heat is 
stored deep beneath the sea, preventing it from contributing to 
temperatures at surface level.

Volcanic eruptions and changes in the sun’s activity are also thought to have contributed.

Scientists
 say they are confident in the computer programs they use to model the 
effects of carbon dioxide on the planet – they just can’t predict random
 events such as volcanic eruptions. They say that such pauses in warming
 occur regularly through history, the slowdown is only temporary and 
climate change remains a pressing threat.

For
 the first time, the IPCC also makes a short-term forecast, saying that 
temperatures will rise between 0.2c and 0.6c between now and 2035.

By
 the end of the century, the global average temperature could rise by 
4.8c.

This is lower than the previous worst case scenario of 6.4c but 
scientists stress it is still enough to have an ‘enormous’ impact on the
 planet.

The lowest 
predicted temperature increase has also been scaled down from 1.1c, to 
0.3c – however, they claim achieving this would require rapid and 
drastic cuts in emissions.

Melting
 ice and an expansion of water as it warms could drive sea levels up by 
up to 32 inches by the end of the century – 40 per cent more than 
previously predicted.

The 
IPCC also says it is ‘very likely’ that the Gulf Stream, which brings 
heat north from the tropics and keeps Britain warmer than it would be 
otherwise, will slow down.

This could stop the temperature rising for 
ten or 20 years in Britain but would be unlikely to make the country 
much colder.

The IPCC has 
revised down its estimate of how sensitive the climate is to carbon 
dioxide, saying that a doubling of levels in the atmosphere would raise 
temperatures long-term by between 1.5c and 4.5c. The previous lower 
limit was 2c.

The report 
says it is ‘extremely likely’ – or at least 95 per cent certain – that 
the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation are the main cause of 
rising temperatures since the Fifties.

That level of certainty is up from 90 per cent in the report in 2007 and 66 per cent in 2001.

The
 world’s biggest environmental charities, including Greenpeace and 
Friends of the Earth, called for immediate action to cut greenhouse gas 
emissions.

David MacKay, of
 the Department of Energy & Climate Change, said reducing the amount
 of carbon dioxide we pump into the atmosphere is unlikely to be enough.

Instead, it is ‘very likely’ we will need to embrace new technologies 
such as artificial trees that actively suck carbon out of the 
atmosphere.

The findings of the report and two that will follow will 
feed into treaty talks in Paris in 2015.

Energy
 Secretary Ed Davey said: ‘This strengthens the case for international 
leaders to work for an ambitious, legally binding global agreement in 
2015 to cut carbon emissions.’

David
 Bull, of Unicef, said: ‘Scientists are more certain than ever that 
climate change is real. How we choose to act now will make a vital 
difference to the lives of today’s children and of future generations.

‘If we fail, our children will carry the devastating burden of our inaction.’

Scientists claim that global average sea levels will continue to rise during the 21st century under all temperature scenarios presented in the report. They say it will 'very likely' exceed that observed during 1971-2010 due to increased ocean warming and loss of mass from glaciers and ice sheets

During the longest period calculated (1901-2012), almost the entire globe experienced surface warming. The report said that warming of the climate system is 'unequivocal'. However, the report conceded that world temperatures have barely risen in the past 15 years

The authors of the latest IPCC report have clearly been stung by the barrage of criticism over the past few years.

For while they are more confident than ever that mankind is changing the climate, several of the gloomier predictions from the previous 2007 analysis are toned down.

Some of the changes reflect the science and growing sophistication of computer models. But other parts of the report appear to have been written in direct response to climate change sceptics. This follows huge embarrassment when claims that most Himalayan glaciers would vanish within 25 years were exposed as nonsense.

Himalayan glaciers: Scientists have already withdrawn claims that they would vanish in 25 years

IPCC chairman Rajendra Pachauri said that ‘human failing’ led to the predicted date being brought forward by 300 years. In fact, the claim had been lifted from a report by the WWF. The latest report simply says that the world’s glaciers will shrink by between 15 and 85 per cent by the end of the century.

One of the biggest differences between yesterday’s report and the 2007 version comes in a key figure, used to work out how much temperatures will respond to the extra greenhouse gases pumped into the air by factories, farming and cars. Six years ago, the IPCC estimated that a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase temperatures between 2c and 4.5c.

The latest update tones down that effect, known as the ‘equilibrium climate sensitivity’. Now the same increase in CO2 will lead to a rise of between 1.5c and 4.5c, the IPCC says. In 2007, the IPCC gave a range of estimates for temperature increases by the end of the century – from 1.1c above the 1850 levels to a whopping 6.4c hike.

The new report is more measured, predicting increases between 0.3c and 1.7c if carbon emissions are halted almost immediately, and 2.6-4.8c if they are unchecked.There are other changes.

In 2007, the authors of the report predicted that tropical storms would be more intense and frequent under a climate change future.

Today, they are far less confident – and say there is only a ‘more likely than not’ chance of more intense tropical storms in North America and the Western North Pacific.

As was widely anticipated, the report acknowledges that global warming has slowed down since the exceptionally hot year of 1998 – but adds that 15 years is not long enough to make any firm conclusions about this apparent pause.

There is also a reference to the Medieval warm period – a time between 950 and 1250 when temperatures were similar to the late 20th century. However, the authors say this warming did not take place as coherently across seasons and regions as the current phase of global warming. 

Many of the predictions and measurements are more gloomy. Sea levels are now predicted to rise more quickly and carbon dioxide concentrations in the air are now the highest they have been for 800,000 years. In 2007, the levels were at a 650,000-year high.

Six years ago, the scientists said it was ‘very likely’ that human behaviour was changing the climate, but they now believe it is ‘extremely likely’.
