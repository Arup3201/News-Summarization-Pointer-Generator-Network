A body found near a river south of Seattle, Washington is that of missing actress Misty Upham, who disappeared nearly two weeks ago after telling authorities she was suicidal, according to police.

Upham, 32, a Native American actress who earned wide praise for her roles in movies including August: Osage County, Frozen River and Django Unchained, was last seen on October 5 near a relative's home in Auburn, Washington.

The actress had returned to the Seattle-area to help care for her father, Charles Upham, who suffered a stroke last year. 

It was Misty's father Charles Upham who identified the lifeless body as his own daughter and told the authorities, reports US Weekly.

Tragedy: The dead body of Misty Upham, 32, who was missing since October 5, was found on Thursday

Shortly after her disappearance, Upham told KIRO-FM that his daughter was upset and erratic and had stopped taking medication for anxiety and bipolar disorder.

Auburn police had responded to a suicide call at Misty Upham's residence in the days before she was last seen, authorities said.

Her father previously said he did not believe she was suicidal.

The identity of the body discovered Thursday near the White River, about 30 miles south of downtown Seattle, is confirmed as Misty Upham but the cause of death is still unknown.

It took just over five hours to identify the body.

The Hollywood Reporter spoke with Seattle-based filmmaker Tracy Rector who said that Misty Upham's uncle, Robert Upham, organized a search party to look for the missing actress three days ago. 

'We waited at the site where the team found the body,' Rector told The Hollywood Reporter.

'It took about five-and-a-half hours to confirm. Then we gathered around her body to say prayers and now we're all gathered at the church.'

Mr Upham told the MailOnline late Wednesday that he was frantic to find his daughter and felt that media attention had focused on her glamorous days on the red carpet and not her as a 'normal person.'

He said the actress, a member of the Blackfoot tribe, had cut off her long locks before she went missing.

He denied his daughter would ever go through with a suicide. 

He told KIRO-FM that Misty was in a 'psychotic' state when she left her house with only the clothes on her back and without her medication.

'It wasn't like she just decided to take time off,' he said.

He added: 'She has said suicidal things in the past but never followed through,' he said. 'She doesn't believe in killing herself. She believes that is a sin and she would never do that.'

Where is Misty? Upham's parents had been canvassing their town and hanging 'missing' posters

Speaking to HollywoodLife.com, Mona Upham, Misty's mother, accused the Seattle area police of not doing enough to find her daughter. 

She attributed it to her Native-American background. 'I think if Misty was different-looking they would be doing a lot more to help find her,' she said.

This was not the first time Upham has reportedly left her home without notice, and it is also not the first time police have responded to suicide calls at her residence.

People magazine reported that in the last year, police have responded to Upham's apartment four times following suicide calls.

Upham may have been under a lot of stress prior to her death. 

A source reportedly told People that Upham was struggling financially and sometimes had trouble paying her rent.

Police received a suicide call on October 5, but when officers arrived, she was no longer at her father's house. 

A day later, her father went to the police asking that his daughter be listed as a 'missing and endangered person.'

The police did not comply, saying that Upham's case did not meet the criteria because her disappearance was not 'unexplainable, involuntary or suspicious,' according to USA Today.

Therefore, the Upham family took to Facebook and local media to alert the public about their missing daughter and to enlist the public's help in finding her.

In a Facebook post on Upham's page, the family stated: 'We have been consumed by chasing down leads and doing ground searches in the area she was last seen. It is only her family searching right now, hanging posters, checking with shelters, hospitals, and asking people in the area if she has been seen.

Upham is best known for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River,' for which she received an Independent Spirit Award nomination. She recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County.' Her next onscreen role will be in 'Cake' with Jennifer Aniston and Anna Kendrick.

Movies: Upham recently played a house keeper in 'August: Osage County' which starred Meryl Streep and Julia Roberts. But she had won an award for her role in the 2008 independent film 'Frozen River'
