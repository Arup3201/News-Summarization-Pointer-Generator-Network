I was the man who had everything. I made a fortune, married a beautiful wife, had five children, and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition. 

Ever since my school days I wanted to be a politician. My election to represent my Essex constituency of Braintree in 2005 was one of the proudest moments of my life. So too was joining the Government as Minister for Civil Society.

Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. Many will regard me as a failure.

Tory MP Brooks Newmark said he has 'traumatised' his family after it emerged he sent explicit pictures to two women, pictured with his wife Lucy 

And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk.

Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them.

Late at night, I began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media. Deep inside, I knew I was playing with fire. Now it has consumed me and my family.

When a newspaper exposed one of these episodes – involving a male freelance reporter using stolen pictures to impersonate a young female Conservative Party activist – I stood down as a Minister.

Now, in response to what seems to be a new text-and-tell story, I am standing down as an MP at the next Election.

I want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me, I hope, a better husband and father, and giving me a chance to contribute in some way to the country in future.

True, I made big sacrifices for my career, leaving a highly paid job in finance to dedicate myself to the day-to-day concerns of my constituents in Braintree. Many of my counterparts from Harvard and Oxford days mocked me for this.

I tried to explain to them that I wanted to give back: using my privilege and education to help people solve their daily problems – helping them navigate the bureaucratic maze on issues such as welfare and housing, and ensuring that Braintree had its own community hospital. What is the point of making millions when you can change the lives of thousands?

But a far greater price was paid by my family. All too often I was an absent dad, arriving home late at night when the children were in bed. I missed family meals, holidays and vital moments in their lives. I will never get those back.

Worse, I was emotionally absent, seeking the buzz of achievement when I should have been dealing with the concerns of those nearest and dearest to me: my wife above all. The illusion of success in the Westminster bubble blinded me to reality. Exchanging flirty pictures online is no substitute for the love and companionship that a real marriage offers.

I still look back with pride on my campaign to reduce youth unemployment, setting up an education charity in Rwanda and my efforts to encourage women into public life.

Amid the wreckage of my political career, it is some comfort to know that this work was not in vain. These causes will remain close to my heart and I will do what I can to further them even when I am no longer in Parliament.

I will continue to represent my constituents until the General Election in May. But I am seeking help now. I will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family.

I would like to use this terrible moment in my life to appeal to others who are ashamed of their mental ill-health to seek help before it is too late.

I have long argued in Parliament against the stigma which we too often attach to mental illness. But I did not practise what I preached. I talked about my anorexia as a teenager, yet I was never brave enough to admit first that I was suffering from depression, or that I was lapsing into episodes of behaviour that any normal person would regard as bizarre and abhorrent. I realise now – too late – that I need treatment.

Many of my friends have advised me to ‘tough this out’. After all, they say, I have not broken any law. I have not stolen any money. Many other politicians have done far worse things to their families – and their careers have survived and even flourished. I have received countless messages of support – from all political quarters and none – along these lines in recent days, and I am profoundly grateful for them.

But for me that is not the point. I do not want to be a battle-scarred veteran of Westminster politics. I want to be a person who brings happiness to those around me – and thus to myself. That can come only if I change.

I do not blame the media for my downfall. It is for others to judge their behaviour and their ethics.

The fault is mine alone. If I had sought help earlier, none of this would have happened.

But I do hope that the media will leave me and my family alone as we try to rebuild our lives.
