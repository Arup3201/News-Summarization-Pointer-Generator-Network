According to Chandu's relatives he was allegedly slapped by his teacher after arriving late to school. He is then thought to have hit his head on a nail poking out of a wall.

The teacher involved has been named as Sumathi.

Chandu's relatives yesterday held his body outside the schools main gates and refused to leave until the teacher and the school's principal were arrested.

The boy's parents, are also believed to have sought compensation from the school and the government.   

Senior police officials were sent to the school to help deal with the unrest, but it is understood the protest ended later that afternoon after the boy's parents came to an understanding with school officials. 

Child Rights Protection Committee president Anuradha Rao said the teacher involved 'deserves nothing less than life imprisonment'.

Chandu's body has now been sent for a post mortem.
