Wannabe explorers are being offered the chance to navigate outer space in an experience previously only available to NASA astronauts.

For $395 participants get to don a pressurised space suit, take off in a spacecraft and navigate a custom built simulator on Earth, Mars or the Moon, as part of a Space Suit Experience.

Before getting suited-up, those involved are lectured on what to expect, then get to fly above the moon in a simulator.

After successfully completing the mission, participants are given a t-shirt, a mission patch and celebrate with a shot of vodka.

The experience was created by Ted Southern and Nik Moiseev, who founded specialist design firm Final Frontier Design in 2010, and was launched in New York last month.

Mr Southern, 36, said the company had put 'all sorts of people into our space suits' over the last four years and decided it 'might be nice' to offer the experience to members of the public.

He said the company has taken several bookings since its public launch and plan to offer the experience at larger tourist attractions like the Intrepid in New York and the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.

Mr Southern said the company had big plans for their space suit: 'We want to enable humans to travel safer, cheaper, and faster to space and other planets. We envision our suit walking on Mars in our lifetime.'
