Impeccably-bred Ol’ Man River has been handed quotes of 20-1 for both the 2015 2,000 Guineas and Derby by Coral after justifying a tall reputation on his Curragh debut on Sunday.

The Aidan O’Brien-trained 11-10 favourite, who cost his Coolmore Stud owners 2.85million euros, is a son of the late 1999 Arc winner Montjeu, who sired 2008 Derby winner Pour Moi, while his dam is Finsceal Beo, winner of the 2007 English and Irish 1,000 Guineas when trained by Jim Bolger.

Ol’ Man River beat Aared three-quarters of a length in the one-mile Irish Stallion Farms EBF Maiden under Joseph O’Brien.

While the initial success was inevitably the catalyst to a confetti distribution of bookmaker quotes, Ol’ Man River can be credited with travelling smoothly throughout in a manner that demands he will be tested in a higher level.

How soon that will be is as yet unknown.

The colt holds a clutch of Group One entries but O’Brien said he would be in no rush to get Ol’ Man River back on the track.

The trainer added: ‘It looked a good solid race and he travelled very strongly. He had to get tired going that gallop first time, but he cruised into the lead.

‘We’ll take our time with him and won’t be in any panic. We’d rather go gentle and see what’s going to happen.

‘The good thing about him is he’s a strong traveller and seems to have plenty of pace. Looking at today he wouldn’t mind going back to seven furlongs.’

Inevitably, given the strength of stock in his Ballydoyle stable in Co Tipperary and his success in the last three runnings of the race, O’Brien-trained colts dominate the embryonic 2015 Investec Derby market.

Coral have the Irish trainer Glorious Goodwood winner Highland Reel and Curragh maiden winner John F Kennedy sharing favouritism at 10-1 while Ol’ Man River is bracketed with unraced Sir Isaac Newton, a son of Galileo which cost 3.6million guineas as a yearling when sold at Tattersalls in October.

Meanwhile, it was also a significant day at the Curragh for jockey Andrea Atzeni, who won the Group Three Round Tower Stakes on Ger Lyon-trained Cappella Sansevero.

It was a first win for Atzeni in the colours of Qatar Racing since it was revealed that he will be replacing the retiring Jamie Spencer as No 1 jockey to the organisation of Sheik Fahad Al Thani and his brothers in 2015.

Trainer Richard Hannon, who won the Group Three Prix de Meautry at Deauville with OIivier Peslier-ridden Coulsty, plans to return his 2,000 Guineas winner Night of Thunder in the Group One Prix du Moulin at Longchamp on September 14.

Return: Night of Thunder (r) could be back for the Prix du Mouln at Longchamp in his first race since July

The colt, which hasn’t run since failing to stay a mile and a quarter in the Group One Eclipse Stakes at Sandown in July, will be joined by stablemate Toronado in the mile race providing the ground doesn’t get soft.
