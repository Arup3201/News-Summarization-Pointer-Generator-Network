It is a country known for ABBA, meatballs and flat-pack furniture - and Sweden is hoping its latest export will be just as easy to recognise.

The Swedish government has launched a national typeface based on 'Scandinavian minimalism' that it hopes will give its posters, signs and websites a cohesive look.

Sweden Sans, which designers describe as a 'basic sans serif font with a modern twist', will now replace the various typefaces used by different national agencies.

Modern twist: The Swedish government hopes Sweden Sans, pictured above, will give its posters, signs and websites representing Sweden a cohesive look. The idea of a national font could now go global

The aim is to create a single 'visual brand' to be used when representing Sweden internationally. 

And designers behind the font are now working on similar briefs for other countries. 

The team at Stockholm design agency Söderhavet, who worked on the government brief, said that they were inspired by the national flag and vintage Swedish signs.

Font designer Stefan Hattenbach, who collaborated with the agency on the six-month project, said that Sweden Sans is a 'modern' but edgy typeface.

He told the Guardian: 'Aesthetics are very important in Sweden and we have a long tradition of great architecture, furniture and design – so this was the natural next step.' 

'It was a big responsibility to be representing our country, but we were really proud to be asked.' 

Inspiration: The Stockholm-based designers took Sweden's national flag, pictured, as their starting point. A government website said that it is 'a classic and timeless typeface'

He added that he wanted people to appreciate the look as a whole and not notice the typeface specifically. 

And Mr Hattenbach said that the idea of a national font could go global.

He said: 'We can't name names as projects are still in their first phases, but we're currently in discussion to do much more nation branding in the future. 

The font will now be rolled out across all government ministries and agencies. 

There is a website dedicated to ensure that all aspects of design - from colours to typography - remain consistent across all aspects of published material.

According to the website, called Identitytool,  Sweden Sans is 'a classic and timeless typeface that can be used in both digital and analogue formats'. 

'Sweden Sans is a long-term choice of typeface; it has an unassuming character and fits well with a broad spectrum of other typefaces.'

It then urges visitors to the site to 'always use it when communicating the image of Sweden'. 

A new font could help make reading easier for dyslexics. 

'Dyslexie' has been designed in a way that makes it harder for individual letters to be confused - a common problem experienced by those with dyslexia. 

Dutch designer Christian Boer, who developed the font, said they often unconsciously switch, rotate and mirror letters in their mind.

He told the Guardian: 'Traditional typefaces make this worse, because they base some letter designs on others, inadvertently creating ‘twin letters’ for people with dyslexia.'

Mr Boer has weighted his letters more heavily at the bottom and has made subtle distinctions between letters like 'b' 'd' and 'p' - which can often look similar in traditional fonts - to help stop the confusion.

Other similar letters are given different heights and their proportions slightly deformed. 

There is also greater space between Dyslexie letters than those in a traditional font - helping to stop letter crowding that can cause problems for dyslexics. 

Studies from researchers at the University of Amsterdam and the University of Twente have revealed that 84 per cent of readers could read text in the Dyslexie font faster than a standard typeface, while 77 per cent reported fewer mistakes.
