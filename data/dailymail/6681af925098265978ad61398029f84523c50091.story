The father of a five-year-old Australian boy who died in the family's litter-covered home said he allowed his children to live in squalor for fear his mentally ill wife would take them from him.

The boy was illiterate, couldn't walk weighed just 42lbs when he died in 2012, after cutting his foot on a tin of cat food discarded in the filthy house, which was littered with rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture.

The father, who is in his 40s, said he allowed his two boys to live in squalor while he went to work a $160,000 (£88,104) because he feared they would be taken away, a Melbourne court has heard. 

The five-year-old boy died in 2012 after cutting his foot on an open tin of cat food that was buried beneath piles of rubbish on the floor in the Melbourne home

The Melbourne house was in such a terrible state at the time of the boy's death a judge said he couldn't see how anybody could perform basic tasks in it without having to suppress a gag. 

The father allowed his two boys to live in squalor because he feared they would be taken away, a Melbourne court has heard.

He left the child-rearing to the boys' mother - a self-described 'deadbeat' - who suffered from severe mental health problems and threatened to remove them if he tried to get help, according to the man's lawyer.

Victorian County Court Judge Michael Rozenes said the boy's father must have shut off his senses when he entered the house.

'There isn't a single square inch of that house where anyone can do that (perform daily tasks) without having to suppress a gag,' Judge Rozenes said at a plea hearing on Wednesday.

The house has been described as being in a state of extreme squalor, littered with rotting and spoilt food, mould, faeces and broken furniture 

The boy weighed 42lbs at the time of his death and had never been taken to a doctor, nor been registered at birth.

The cause of death could not be determined but Crown Prosecutor Susan Borg told the court it could have been tetanus or botulism.

'Toxic gas produced by rotting food also could have been a factor,' Ms Borg said.

'He made a decision that it was perhaps easier not to go head to head with the mother.'

'The father went out into the real world to work, where he earned $160,000 per year, then returned to the filthy conditions but did nothing.'

'He did nothing to help those children,' she said.

Ms Borg said he told police he did not feel responsible following the death and he and his wife had dedicated 'a big chunk of their lives' both financially and emotionally to their sons. 

Defence lawyer Hilary Bonney said the mother and father, who both pleaded guilty to two charges each of reckless conduct endangering their two sons, suffered from mental health issues.

She said the mother was 'mad' and the father was scared to stand up to her.

'If he mentioned getting help out of the family she would threaten him and say she would take the boys away,' Ms Bonney said.

The mother told the court 'deadbeat' when asked about her profession. The prosecutor says there faeces and rotting food were found at the home

The mother, who died of organ failure earlier this month, in particular was delusional and suffered from alcoholism,' she said.

A court appearance in July had to be rescheduled after the mother collapsed in the dock, prompting calls for medical help. 

The father told police he believed the five-year-old attended kindergarten and his other son, now 10, went to school.'

Neither attended school nor kindergarten and the youngest, who was born in the house, was never taken to a doctor and his birth was not registered, the court heard.

'He felt he couldn't combat her,' Ms Bonney said.

'(He) was desperately holding on to his wife and his children.'

Psychologist Elizabeth Warren told the court both parents had mental health problems. 

Crown Prosecutor Ms Borg said she did not believe it was necessary to impose an immediate jail term on the man, while the defence asked for a suspended sentence.

She said the man has not seen his oldest son since the five-year-old's death and losing the boys was punishment in itself.

The man, who broke down during the court hearing, will remain on bail until he is sentenced on November 27.
