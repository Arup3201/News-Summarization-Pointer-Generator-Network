He left the field to an ovation fit for a hero. Radamel Falcao had his first goal for Manchester United and it proved to be decisive in clinching victory over Everton at Old Trafford.

It also obscured the fact that a player who could end up costing United in excess of £50million had squandered a number of opportunities to get off the mark earlier in the game.

Alongside him, Robin van Persie posed even less of a threat. Neither striker, it has to be said, is living up to his reputation at the moment.

Falcao and Robin van Persie have a good statistical record up front together but never seemed to click

The statistics will show that either Falcao and Van Persie have been on the scoresheet in all three games they have started together. 

Indeed, Van Persie’s first of the season at Leicester was presented to him on a plate by Falcao’s far post cross.

Unfortunately for United, it ended there. Since then, this has looked less like a strike partnership and more like two forwards struggling side by side for top form; proof that the fantasy football approach of throwing together two big-name players does not guarantee instant success.

There is no clever interplay, no obvious understanding, and no running off one another. Thank goodness United have Angel di Maria to pull it altogether.

Falcao has still not completed 90 minutes for United since joining on loan on transfer deadline day

In fairness to Falcao and Van Persie, both are working their way back from knee injuries. In Falcao’s case, he has yet to complete a full 90 minutes since rupturing the ACL in his left knee playing for Monaco in a French Cup tie in January, forcing him to miss the World Cup.

Van Persie made it to Brazil with Holland after suffering a knee injury playing for United against Olympiacos last season, but he has not looked like the same player since.

He had just one chance of note against Everton, latching onto to Di Maria’s first-time flick early in the game but steered the ball high over Tim Howard’s goal.

Falcao, on the other hand, could have had a hat-trick.

Falcao was barely involved in United's build-up play but did his most important work in the Everton box

Robin van Persie spent more time on the ball for Manchester United but in less dangerous positions

Falcao contributed little aside from goals, but his strike proved to be the all-important winner

Inside the opening 20 minutes alone, he met Luke Shaw’s excellent cross with a diving header which failed to beat Howard, and then volleyed well wide after being played in by Di Maria’s flick.

The former FC Porto and Atletico Madrid striker then met Di Maria’s corner on the full just before half-time and succeeded only in volleying it high into the Stretford End. It was the attempt of a player increasingly desperate to break his duck.

He had two more half chances within two minutes of the restart and then snatched at another close-range effort when Shaw picked him out in the box again.

But a player with Falcao’s remarkable goalscoring record will always be a threat. ‘A proper centre-forward,’ said Paul Scholes on television.  

Van Persie was in the game more throughout but less likely to arrive on the end of a move than his partner

When Di Maria for once mis-hit a shot in the 62nd minute, his teammate had dropped off his markers and was lurking to stab the ball past Howard from 10 yards.

The relief on Falcao’s face was clear to see. Instead of making a rather awkward exit 11 minutes later, Old Trafford gave him a rousing ovation when he was replaced by James Wilson.

‘He needed that goal,’ said Louis van Gaal afterwards. ‘I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal. 

Falcao was beginning to look frustrated as he failed to take his chances before he finally found the net

Falcao may be more used to his role in the opponent's area, but he performed a crucial role on his own line

It was clear how much Falcao's goal meant, both to the player himself and the United fans

‘He’s a player who will normally make a goal every match and he has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.’

United must hope their manager is right. Continuing to play Falcao and Van Persie together will mean dropping Wayne Rooney into his less preferred midfield role and fewer opportunities for Juan Mata.

The two stars leading the line must produce, both individually and as a partnership, to make it all worthwhile.
