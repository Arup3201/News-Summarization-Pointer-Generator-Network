Matthew Tvrdon pleaded guilty to killing Karina Menzies but denies her murder

A van driver has today admitted running down and killing a mother-of-three during a hit and run rampage that injured more than 12 others.

Matthew Tvrdon mowed down parents and young children during the spree in Cardiff in October last year in which Karina Menzies was hit and killed.

He pleaded not guilty to her murder today but admitted her manslaughter with diminished responsibility.

Tvrdon appeared via videolink at Cardiff Crown Court from Ashworth high security psychiatric hospital in Maghull, Merseyside.

The court heard he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the attack.

Seven children were among more than a dozen people hurt in the hit and run spree.

He admitted seven charges of attempted murder, two of grievous bodily harm with intent and two of attempted grievous bodily harm with intent. 

Tvrdon also admitted four charges of causing actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving.

But the court heard he denied murder of Karina.

A decision on whether he will go to trial will be made before a hearing next month.

Prosecutor Ian Murphy said: 'At the time the defendant was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia.

'He has admitted some serious charges - one of manslaughter and seven of attempted murder as well as lesser charges including assault with a Crooklock.

'We have not had a chance to involve the victims and their families and are requesting an adjournment in order to do this.'

Tvrdon appeared relaxed and calm in the video link to court, dressed in a black top and trousers and wearing glasses.

He was originally charged with one count of murder, 13 counts of attempted murder, four counts of actual bodily harm and one of dangerous driving.

Karina died at the scene and 13 others were treated in hospital - two were in a critical but stable condition.

Her daughter Tiana, three, suffered a fractured pelvis and broken legs while sister Ellie, eight, had a head injury. Both have made a full recovery.

Mourners placed flowers next to where Karina died in October

Karina was killed outside Ely Fire Station - one of five scenes in Ely and Leckwith in Cardiff where people were struck by the white Iveco van.

The mother-of-three managed
to throw her daughters to safety but friends said at the time that she 
could not run away from the vehicle because she suffered from a 
progressive nerve condition.

They said her legs had been weakened by  Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease that damages nerves outside the brain and spine. 

She was described as a 'hero' by her brother Craig, who paid tribute to her after the October attack.

He said: 'She’s got [the children] 
out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the 
van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her.

‘She would have done this 
instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the 
bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe 
she’s gone.’

The guilty pleas today follow a series of behind-the-scenes conferences between the prosecution and defence lawyers.

The case was adjourned until June 5.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
