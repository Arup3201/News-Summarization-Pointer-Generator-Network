He started life sharing a tent in the Australian outback with his 10 siblings but today Richard Farleigh is one of the best-paid investors in the world.

Mr Farleigh, who was able to retire at just 34 years of age, admits to saving 'like a squirrel' when he started out as a banker in his twenties because he was sure his success wouldn't last.

The 53-year-old, who started without a cent after being born into a poor family in the country town of Kyabram, 200km northwest of Melbourne, said he just managed to learn how money worked along the way.

Mr Farleigh and his siblings were taken into care when he was three because his father was a violent alcoholic - he was placed into a foster home in Peakhurst, southwest of Sydney, in the 1960s.

'After coming through the foster system… luckily, I won a scholarship to study economics and maths at (the University of NSW), which changed my life. My knowledge of how money works increased along the way,' Mr Farleigh told the UK's Telegraph.

When he accepted a job at the leading investment bank at the time, Bankers Trust Australia, Mr Farleigh told of how his boss said 'if he makes a buck for the bank, I'll walk backwards to Bourke'.

'And Bourke is a long way from Sydney. As a child I was shy. Even by the time I became an investment banker in my early 20s I didn't have a positive personality – I wasn't very dynamic. We have a laugh about it now, as I ended up being the highest earner for the bank,' he said.

Mr Farleigh retired from the finance world when he was 'probably one of the highest-paid hedge fund managers in the world' – just 20 years after he made his first dollar hustling chess at Sydney's Hyde Park when he was 14.

He moved to Monaco to start his retirement but was back in the business world just two years later when he decided to move to London.

In London Mr Farleigh stepped up his investments, including ownership of a private members club in the 90s, Home House, which was frequented by the likes of Madonna

It was in London that he stepped up his investments, including ownership of a private members club in the 90s, Home House, which was frequented by the likes of Madonna.

He decided to increase his investments when he appeared on the business-related game show, Dragons' Den, in 2006. Mr Farleigh invested in a company called Levi Roots' Reggae Reggae Sauce on the show and sold his stake for ten-times return 12 months later.

Mr Farleigh continues to invest and he said his foster parents were still bewildered by his success today.

'I think they were a bit bemused by it because they and my school thought I was backward when I was young,' he said.
