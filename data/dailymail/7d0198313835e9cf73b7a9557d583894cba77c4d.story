Devastated by the worst nuclear disaster in history, Chernobyl is now a barren ghost town slowly being forgotten.

These astonishing aerial photographs of the former power plant and the neighbouring city of Pripyat show how they are becoming hidden from view as the surrounding forest closes in.

Following the disaster - which occurred during a systems test on April 26, 1986   -  the Ukrainian government evacuated 350,000 residents from Chernobyl and Pripyat.

Swamped: These astonishing new photographs show how Chernobyl - the site of the world's worst nuclear accident - and surrounding city of Pripyat are being reclaimed by the surrounding forest

Ghost town: This image shows Pripyat, which was founded in 1970. Its 50,000 residents were evacuated a few days after the 1986 disaster

Open: This file picture taken in the '90s shows how Prypiat looked before the forest completely closed in around it

Bare: This 1986 picture shows Prypiat following the mass evacuation. It housed 47,000 inhabitants, including 17,000 children before the disaster

An exclusion zone  covering an area of more than 1,000sq miles around the abandoned 
plant was created to protect people from the effects of any lingering radiation.

These pictures of the zone - taken from a height of 10,000 metres, show how after 27 years of remaining largely uninhabitable, the surrounding Red Forest is slowly reclaiming the plant and the city. 

Pripyat was founded in 1970 for the Chernobyl Nuclear 
Power Plant and grew to a population of 49,360 before it was evacuated a few days after
 the disaster. The pictures, as reported by EnglishRussia.com, show its residential buildings spurting out from the thick woodland below.

The secret Duga-1 complex can also be seen among the dense woodland. The 
radar system could detect launches of a potential enemy in North America. But despite its hi-tech capabilities, it is now left to ruin.

Forgotten: The Chernobyl power plant is now a scar on the otherwise large swathe of woodland

Different: This file picture of Chernobyl nuclear power plant shows just how much it has changed since the disaster, with the forest now completely enveloping it

Hidden: Following the disaster in 1986, a  Exclusion Zone was set up around the site which has now been swamped by the Red Forest

Surrounded: This image shows 'Chernobyl-2' which at the time of the disaster was completely secret. It was a radar system which could detect launches of a potential enemy in North America

The accident on April  26,1986, created a huge explosion and fire which released large quantities of radioactive particles
 into the atmosphere, spreading over western USSR and 
Europe.

Although tens of 
thousands of people evacuated the area, a few residents refused to 
leave. A handful of older residents moved back to be close to family 
graves.

Tourists may obtain 
day passes, and some workers who are rebuilding parts of the site are 
allowed in for limited hours only each month.  Scientists say the area will 
not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years.

Efforts
 to contain the contamination and prevent a greater catastrophe involved
 more than 500,000 workers and cost 18 billion rubles.

The
 official casualty count of 31 deaths has been disputed and there have 
also been numerous long-term effects such as cancers and deformities.

Dangerous: Scientists say the area will not be safe to live in for another 20,000 years

Panoramic: This shows the photographer's view as the plane flies over the Ukraine

Tough job: A worker patrols Prypyat on Sunday as dismantling work continues at the scene of the world's worst nuclear accident

Important: Workers need to constantly  help protect against any possible future radiation leaks
