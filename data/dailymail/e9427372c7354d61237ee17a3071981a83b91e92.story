A man injured in Anders Behring Breivik's devastating Oslo bomb blast today described the terrifying aftermath as blood pumped out of his arm and panic started to set in.

Eivind Dahl Thoresen, 26, was hit by falling debris on the street outside the Norwegian government building in the July 22 explosion that killed eight.

Face to face with Breivik at the latter's trial he said he only realised he was in trouble when, rushing to help another victim, he was told: 'Are you going to help me? Look at yourself.'

Killer: Breivik has admitted killing 77 people in the July 22 slaughter, but insists it was 'self-defence'

With blood soaking through his jeans and T-shirt, he cried for help until two people arrived to bandage his wounds with clothes he was carrying in a bag.

He said: 'I felt alternately cold and warm. At that point I was sure I would die.'

Thoresen, who was hospitalised for three weeks after the blast so doctors could surgically remove shards from his arms and legs, still needs crutches to walk.

His lawyer showed the court pictures of the grim scene.

Following Thoresen's testimony, Breivik slammed a psychiatric report that declared him insane, insisting it was based on 'evil fabrications' meant to portray him as irrational and unintelligent.

He said: 'It is not me who is described in that report'.

A second psychiatric examination found that Breivik was sane. The five-judge panel trying Breivik on terror charges for the attacks will consider both reports.

Breivik's mental state is the key issue that remains unresolved in the trial, since he has admitted to a bombing in Oslo's government district that killed eight people.

He also confessed to a subsequent shooting massacre at a Labour Party youth camp that left 69 people dead, most of them teenagers.

But he claims the attacks were 'necessary' and that the victims had betrayed Norway by embracing immigration.

If found guilty and sane, Breivik would face 21 years in prison, though he can be held longer if deemed a danger to society. If declared insane, he would be committed to compulsory psychiatric care.

He said: 'To a political activist, the worst thing that can happen is to end up in a mental hospital. That would de-legitimise everything you stand for.'

Breivik showed no remorse today as he listened to testimony describing the horrific injuries of the bombing victims, declaring instead if anyone should apologise it was the governing Labour Party.

He said he had hoped they would change Norway's policy on immigration after his attacks.

He added: 'But instead they continue in the same direction, so the grounds for struggle are unfortunately even more relevant now than before July 22.'

Sounding irritated, the 33-year-old accused the two psychiatrists who declared him psychotic of deciding on the diagnosis prematurely, saying their judgment was clouded by their emotional response to the attacks.

He said: 'They lack expertise in evaluating violent political activists.'

He also criticised the second report on his mental health, by two other psychiatrists who found him 'narcissistic' and 'dissocial' but not criminally insane.

Breivik claims to belong to an anti-Muslim militant group inspired by medieval crusaders and working with two other cells in Norway.

Investigators have said they don't believe the group exists, and prosecutor Svein Holden noted that the second psychiatric report described it as a 'fantasy'.

'It is a real network,' Breivik insisted, saying that police cannot conclude that the group doesn't exist just because they haven't found it.

'If you use that logic, then I didn't exist either before July 22,' Breivik said. 'I wouldn't want to be the police spokesman when the next attack happens in Norway. Because it will happen.'

Fears were also raised again today that Breivik's trial is giving a public platform to a mass-murderer and could spawn copycat crimes by others who share his hatred of Muslims.

'There is a contagion effect that one has to take into consideration,' said Brigitte Nacos, a Columbia University professor who studies terrorism and the mass media.

Col. Zbigniew Muszynski, the head of Poland's Counterterrorism Centre, said security experts believe there have already been violent acts inspired by Breivik, including an Italian extremist's killing of two African immigrants in Florence late last year.

He said: 'There is always the potential danger that someone who hasn't been exposed to extremist propaganda could become interested in it and could undertake activity that is in violation of the law.'

Describing the confusion following the blast, police chief Thor Langli said yesterday initial reports he received suggested there were two suspects, and two other bombs about to explode.

When he heard about the Utoya shooting, he started thinking the bomb and the massacre were the actions of the same person.

'I thought there was a connection. But I didn't have any evidence for that,' Langli said. Turning to Breivik, he added: 'I could not imagine there being two people with so many crazy ideas.'

The self-described militant nationalist testified last week that he had expected to be shot by police after the bombing.

But no one stopped him as he walked to a getaway car parked near the bomb site, and he drove to Utoya.

'I estimated the chances of survival as less than 5 per cent,' Breivik said last Thursday. The trial is scheduled to go on until the end of June.
