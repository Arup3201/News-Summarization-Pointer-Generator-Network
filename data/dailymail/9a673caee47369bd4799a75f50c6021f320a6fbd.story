Sir Stuffington is said to be a cat pirate. And his eye-patch? It's starting a trend.

The one-eyed kitten, about six weeks old, was found by Oregon’s Multnomah County Animal Services on September 13, homeless and roaming Portland’s streets with two other kittens, believed to be his brothers.

Mangy, filthy and flea-infested, he was suffering from an upper respiratory infection when he was found, and he had a heart murmur.

The cat additionally had a possible jaw fracture that has since healed.

He also, strangely, has a permanently curled upper lip, possibly due to the jaw fracture.

Animal rescue workers gave him a flea and de-wormer treatment and started him on antibiotics.

A woman from Portland, Blazer Schaffer, took the three kittens in and created a Facebook fan page for Sir Stuffington.

According to the site, Schaffer says she wants 'to bring awareness to the world about the importance of your local animal shelter & the lives they save every day!'

The fan page describes Sir Stuffington 'an incredibly handsome boy'.

The one-eye cat is now fast becoming a viral ‘pirate’ legend with 15,590 likes on his fan page in just one week.

One fan has posted on his fan page saying, 'Mr Stuffington has started a new genre of Cosplay – Cosplay for Cats, my cat Nunnie what's to be like him!'

Schaffer is urging people to buy professional pictures taken of Sir Stuffington, as all the proceeds go to Multnomah County Animal Services.
