Kamara James, 29, who battled schizophrenia for years, was found dead in her California apartment

An Olympic fencer who battled schizophrenia for years has been found dead in her California apartment.

Kamara James, 29, from Queens, New York, represented the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.

She was found September 20 at an apartment in Modesto where she lived alone. 

A spokesperson for the coroner said her death is still under investigation -  it does not appear suspicious, and suicide is not believed to be the cause.

James battled the mental health condition since her senior year at Princeton, but was thought to be doing well recently.

James, who was born in Kingston, Jamaica, and raised by her mother in Queens, began fencing aged nine after being introduced by a charity. 

'It was difficult,' she once told the New York Daily News. 

'But fencing helped me break out of my shell. I was always over-thinking things. Then I found a way to challenge myself physically and mentally.' 

By her teenage years she was a world junior bronze medalist, earning herself a scholarship spot at a prestigious New York City private school and later to Princeton.  

Even though she did not have the financial backing, according to USA Fencing, James developed a business plan.

An internship at Morgan Stanley led to a $50,000 grant from the firm to support her Olympic expenses where she competed aged 19 and got a bronze medal.

But behind the scenes her family was fractured - she refused to name her father who lived in Jamaica, although she got on well with her stepfather who died of a brain tumor in 1996, saying it was a 'different experience to have a male figure in my home life.'

Her relationship with her mother was poor - they were estranged before she died - and James told the New York Daily News in 2004: 'She's not a big part of my life.'

'Of course, I'd love to have a good relationship with my parents, but it's not detrimental to me or my goals.

Eric Rosenberg told Fencing.net: 'At the beginning of her senior year at Princeton, Kamara had herself admitted to a psychiatric hospital and received a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 

'After only three months of treatment, she was released and returned to school. 

'In a single semester, she managed to complete one year's worth of credits in addition to a 120 page senior thesis and graduate on time. 

'Subsequently, Harvard University admitted her to a Master's program in comparative religion.

On her graduation she opened a fencing club in Greenwich, Connecticut, but then had a second breakdown which was 'a slow, long ride,' according to Rosenberg. 

After her graduation James went in and out of treatment and was occasionally homeless.

'She was beaten up. She lacked a lot of the energy she had,' Rosenberg told PEOPLE magazine. 

'She was emaciated, unkempt, wearing filthy clothes.' 

'Kamara was a survivor; of abuse, of neglect, of poverty and of homelessness. I will not recount the sordid details of all that she endured,' he said on fencing.net.

'All her life, she refused to be defined by her suffering, but rather by her successes.

'Unfortunately, mental illness proved Kamara's most unrelenting adversary. 

'Still, just prior to her death, she had resumed a stable drug regimen, was living comfortably and had begun thinking about the future.'

USA Fencing president Don Anthony issued a statement on her death.

'Kamara James was one of the brightest, precocious, self-assured young people I have ever met,' Mr. Anthony's statement read.

'From her time as a very young fencer at the Peter Westbrook Foundation to her years at Princeton as an accomplished Olympian she remained warm, caring and confident. 

Kamara's untimely passing leaves our fencing community very saddened and her spirit, charm and wit will dearly be missed.' 

Keeth Smart, a 2009 Olympic silver medalist who trained alongside her for more than ten years when they studied together at the Peter Westbrook Foundation said in statement James was 'one of the smartest people' he knew.
