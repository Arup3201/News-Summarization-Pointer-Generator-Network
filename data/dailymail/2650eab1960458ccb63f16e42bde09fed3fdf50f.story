Six different 
nationalities are represented on this year’s Man Booker Prize shortlist,
described as ‘most striking for its global range’.

The six authors in the running for the £50,000 prize were announced yesterday.

Despite
the list’s multi-cultural feel, the bookies’ favourite is British 
author Jim Crace for Harvest, which he has said will be his final novel.

Swansong: Writer Jim Crace, who has been shortlisted for the £50,000 Man Booker Prize with his novel Harvest, has announced it will be his last 'to avoid the inevitable bitterness'

Robert
Macfarlane, chairman of the judges, said the shortlist – of four women 
and  two men – reflected an ‘increasingly globalised world’.

Two
of the nominees raised eyebrows as they have American backgrounds – the
contest, founded in 1969, is open only to writers from the 
Commonwealth, Ireland and Zimbabwe.

But the judges brushed off 
speculation they would open up the competition to the US in the future.

One
of the American authors is Ruth Ozeki, 57, a Buddhist priest with a 
Canadian passport. She was born in New Haven, Connecticut in the United 
States.

The other is Jhumpa
Lahiri, 46, shortlisted for her novel The Lowland.

Born in London and 
of Indian origin, she was raised in Rhode Island and now lives in New 
York.

The shortlist was announced yesterday at the Man Group 
headquarters in central London. 

Crace,
67, was shortlisted for the Booker in 1997 for Quarantine. At 5/2, he 
is the bookies’ favourite to win.

Broadcaster Martha Kearney, one of the
judges, said his book showed the ‘harsh realities of rural life’ and 
the ‘destruction of an English village and a long settled way of life’.

Mr
Macfarlane said of the final six: ‘It is a shortlist that shows the 
English language novel to be a form of world literature.

'This is a 
shortlist that crosses continents, that joins countries and spans 
centuries; Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and Australasia, all are 
written about here.

'The six authors are of six different nationalities.’

He
said the longlist of 13 books was ‘unmistakably the most diverse 
longlist in Man Booker prize history’ and the shortlist of six ‘is most 
striking for its global range’.

Double winner: Author Hilary Mantel won last year's Man Booker Prize with her novel Bring Up The Bodies

The
longlist was notable for its obscurity, after mostly unknown authors 
made the nominations and a number of big-name authors were overlooked, 
including JM Coetzee, Roddy Doyle and Margaret Atwood.

The
other three nominees are 58-year-old Irish novelist Colm Toibin, for 
his novel The Testament of Mary, 31-year-old NoViolet Bulawayo, from 
Zimbabwe, for We Need New Names, and New Zealander Eleanor Catton, for 
her novel The Luminaries.

At 28, she would be the youngest-ever recipient of the prize.

Asked
whether the competition would be opened up to America, Ion Trewin, 
literary director of the Booker Prize Foundation, said: ‘It is one of 
these subjects that is always being discussed; at the moment we are 
concentrating on this year. We have got no plans of announcing any major
change.’

The prize will be awarded on October 15. Last year’s winner was Hilary Mantel, the first woman to win the Booker twice.
