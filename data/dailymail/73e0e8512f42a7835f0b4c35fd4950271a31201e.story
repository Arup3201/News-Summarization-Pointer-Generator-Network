This record-breaking feat is sure to get Blackpool residents – and tourists – pumped up.

The iconic seaside town in Lancashire set a new Guinness World Record today for the world's biggest beach ball.

The gigantic orange and white ball was inflated near Central Pier on Blackpool Beach, weighing a staggering 880 pounds and standing as tall as the White House in Washington, DC, when it was fully inflated. 

Pumped up: Visit Blackpool says it has set a new Guinness Word Record with a gigantic beach ball that has a diameter of 59 ft

Hold on tight: Blackpool's new record was validated on the spot by independent adjudicators, although it still awaits an official declaration

With a diameter of 59 ft, the custom-made orb is three times the size of a standard house and weighs about the same as an adult horse.

It was inflated as part of a Visit Blackpool publicity stunt aimed at attracting tourists and giving the town's reputation a boost. 

Iain Hawkins, spokesman for the tourism board's #BlackpoolsBack campaign, said: 'We wanted to create something special, something unique that illustrates both Blackpool's legendary sense of fun and the fact that there has never been a better time for families to visit the most iconic seaside resort in the UK.

'The giant #BlackpoolsBack beach-ball, the biggest ever made in the world, does all of that and more.' 

It took almost an entire fortnight to manufacture the beach ball and transport it to Blackpool Beach, where it was inflated near Central Pier

Life's a beach: The record-setting beach ball is capable of holding 3,766,313 pints of water or almost 60,000 standard beach balls

Councillor Graham Cain, Blackpool Council's cabinet member for tourism and leisure, said: 'We've gone through years of regeneration and we're now at a point where we can be very proud of the holiday area we have to offer.'

It took an entire fortnight to manufacture and transport the ball, which is capable of holding 3,766,313 pints of water or almost 60,000 standard beach balls.

Had it been inflated by mouth, it would have taken 32 days to blow up.

Once it was inflated, Blackpool's new record was validated on the spot by independent adjudicators, the tourism board said.

Polish supermarket chain Real was the previous record holder.

The grocer inflated a beach ball with a diameter of 51 ft in May 2012.

Tourism officials say the publicity stunt was an attempt to illustrate Blackpool's legendary sense of fun and history as a fun-filled destination for families

When it is fully inflated, the beach ball stands as tall as America's White House and is three times the size of a standard house in the UK
