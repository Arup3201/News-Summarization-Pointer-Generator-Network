Once envisioned as a tourist attraction, it has laid abandoned for decades.   

But now, Johnsonville in Connecticut could be headed for a new life - after a buyer purchased the ghostly village for $1.9million.

The price - a huge $1.1million more than its $800,000 opening bid - will see the owner inherit an array of Victorian buildings over 62 acres of land.

These include an old post office, a schoolhouse, a general store, the original homestead of the mill owners, and even an abandoned church.

The old twin mill town, nestled in the Moodus section of East Haddam, was the unfulfilled vision of an 'eccentric' aerospace engineering executive.

It was snapped up on Auction.com yesterday - just one day before Halloween, Eat Haddam First Selectman, Mark Walter, told NBC Connecticut. 

Mr Walter said the buyer of the property is yet to be identified, but added: 'We're excited. Hopefully now it will come back to life.' 

Johnsonville started in the 19th century as a mill town built around an active twine mill operation on the Moodus River.

Origins: Johnsonville started in the 19th century as a mill town built around an active twine mill operation on the Moodus River. Above, this photo, posted to the town's Facebook page, shows the original Neptune mill in 1832. It was struck by lightning in 1972 and burned

Location: Johnsonville is situated in the Moodus section of East Haddamin. It includes 62 acres of land and numerous buildings

In 1972, Raymond Schmitt, the 'very eccentric' owner of aerospace part firm AGC Inc, bought the property after a lightning strike destroyed the mill.

Schmitt decided to create a Victorian-era tourist attraction, so traveled around the northeast, buying up entire buildings and shipping them to the town.

In addition to the vast array of properties he purchased, he also bought a paddleboat from the World's Fair in the 1960s.

Not as hoped: Schmitt decided to create a Victorian-era tourist attraction, so traveled around the northeast, buying up entire buildings and shipping them to the town. But the town never became a bustling hub for tourists. Above, visitors explore Johnsonville in the 1970s

Empty for decades: Jim Kelly, of brokerage firm RM Bradley, said he had planned the auction to fall around Halloween to play up the more mysterious aspects of the town. Above, one of the properties in the village, which has been closed to visitors for decades

An unusual creation: This photo, posted on Facebook, shows a wooden-covered bridge at the eastern side of the Johnson Millpond.  Schmitt engaged designer Thomas Kronenberger to build the bridge to commemorate the American Bicentennial in 1976

He later transported it to Johnsonville, where he hoped to use it to ferry passengers around the lake in the middle of the property.

But although Schmitt allowed visitors onto the grounds, and weddings were occasionally held at the Swiss chalet-styled restaurant, the town never truly became a bustling hub for tourists and the owner died in 1998. Even the paddleboat began sinking into the lake.

For the past few decades, 'No Trespassing signs' have hung off properties, warning curious travelers to stay away.

Desolate: Mr Kelly said the buyer's plans for the property can not yet be disclosed. Above, Gilbert Clock Co. Livery Stable in Johnsonville

Earlier this month, Damned Connecticut called the grounds 'a weird dead spot' in an otherwise populated town.

Jim Kelly, of brokerage firm RM Bradley, said he had planned the auction to fall around Halloween to play up the more mysterious aspects of the town. 

He added that the property had been auctioned off by sellers William Meyer, of West Palm Beach, and Richard Jabara, of Ridgefield - who bought the village for $2.5million in 2001 - after languishing on the real estate market for several years at an asking price of $2.9million.

The buyer's plans for the village have not yet been disclosed.
