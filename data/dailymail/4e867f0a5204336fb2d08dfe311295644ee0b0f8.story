Liverpool and Manchester City have it all to do in their final group matches if they are to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.

The two Premier League sides know they need to pick up positive results to reach the last 16, although games elsewhere can affect their progression.

With that in mind, Sportsmail explains what City and Liverpool must do to make it through and the positions of the two other English sides in the Champions League, Chelsea and Arsenal, who have both already sealed their places in the knockout rounds.

LIVERPOOL (vs Basle at Anfield, Tuesday December 9)

Only a win against Basle  on Tuesday will do. Brendan Rodgers' side are currently on four points but another three at Anfield will move them above their Swiss opponents, who have six at present.

Ludogorets can also get to seven points with an unlikely win away at group winners Real Madrid, but Liverpool would still go through by virtue of the head-to-head rule after beating the Bulgarian side on home soil and drawing away last month.

MANCHESTER CITY (vs Roma at Stadio Olimpico, Wednesday December 10)

If CSKA Moscow draw away to Bayern Munich, City will qualify by beating Roma in the Italian capital. Or, if Moscow lose to Bayern, a score draw will do for Manuel Pellegrini's men.

If the Russian side somehow manage to win in Munich, City are out no matter what their result.

ARSENAL (vs Galatasaray at Turk Telekom Arena, Tuesday December 9)

Arsenal guaranteed their place in the round of 16 with a win against group leaders Borussia Dortmund last time out. 

They will finish second in Group D unless they beat Galatasaray and Dortmund lose to Anderlecht (or, more unlikely, the German side draw — and Arsenal win by seven).

CHELSEA (vs Sporting Lisbon at Stamford Bridge, Wednesday December 10)

Chelsea sealed top spot in Group G with a 5-0 win away at Schalke in their last group game. The Portuguese side know a point in London will guarantee qualification, although they will definitely go through if Schalke fail to beat Maribor.
