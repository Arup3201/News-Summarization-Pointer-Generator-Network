Eight women badminton players have been thrown out of the Olympics in disgrace for deliberately trying to lose their games.

Yesterday’s mass disqualification is unprecedented at an Olympic Games and followed uproar among 16,000 spectators, who booed their disgust at the players in the Wembley Arena on Tuesday night.

Four pairs – two from South Korea and one each from China and Indonesia – went to extraordinary lengths to avoid winning.

The players had all qualified for the 
quarter-finals of the women’s doubles and were accused of trying to 
manipulate the draw by losing so they would be matched with easier 
opposition in the next round or avoid playing their teammates.

Amid shameful and embarrassing scenes,
 players were deliberately serving into the net or hitting the 
shuttlecock over the court’s lines. The longest rally in one set lasted 
just four shots.

As a furious backlash grew, Lord Coe, head of London 2012, described the players’ actions as ‘depressing and unacceptable’.

The spotlight will be on the Chinese, who dominate world badminton but have been accused of manipulation before.

Petya Nedelcheva, a Bulgarian player 
who was on an adjacent court at the time of the first match, said 
Chinese players routinely tried to avoid playing each other.

She said: ‘China control everything. I
 don’t know who controlled the match to lose but if it is China again, 
they did it so many times last year – they didn’t play against each 
other in 20 matches. They do what they want.’

The Wembley fiasco began when Chinese
 top seeds Wang Xiaoli and Yu Yang started to show little interest in 
beating Koreans Jung Kyung-eun and Kim Ha-na to finish top of Group A.

Coming second would have meant avoiding compatriots and second seeds Tian Qing and Zhao Yunlei until the final.

The Koreans responded to China’s antics by copying them.

Referee Torsten Berg warned all the 
players and produced a black card, meaning they would be disqualified. 
After protests, this was rescinded.

The match restarted and the Koreans went on to win 21-14, 21-11.

Pugh's wry take on the badminton scandal

The matter did not end there as a 
second Korean pair, third seeds Ha Jung-eun and Kim Min-jung, attempted 
to engineer defeat in their match against Indonesia’s Meiliana Jauhari 
and Greysia Polii.

Their motive was apparent retaliation 
to avoid Xiaoli and Yang in the quarter-finals, an outcome they failed 
to achieve as they won 18-21, 21-14, 21-12.

The Indonesians were not bystanders in the affair as they responded to the Koreans by trying to lose themselves.

Gail Emms, the former British 
badminton star and Olympic silver medallist, said: ‘You cannot do this 
in an Olympic Games, this is something that is not acceptable . . . it 
was just disgraceful.’

Miss Emms said the potential for 
match-fixing was raised in a managers’ meeting on Monday but the referee
 had dismissed concerns.

She added: ‘All the managers got 
together with the referee and said, “look, this has happened; in Group D
 you will find some very dodgy matches going on in the evening because 
of it” and the referee laughed and said “don’t be silly”.

‘The managers said “we know the game, we know the players and we know the teams and we know this is going to happen”.’

Korea’s coach Sung Han-kook laid the 
blame squarely at the feet of China. He said: ‘The Chinese started this.
 They did it first. They didn’t want to meet each other in the 
semi-final.’

The Badminton World Federation 
yesterday disqualified the players. Their places will be taken by the 
teams who finished third and fourth in their qualifying groups concerned
 – Canada, Australia, Russia and South Africa.

Locog said fans would not be given any
 refunds, even though some paid up to £80 to see the world’s best 
players. Chief executive Paul Deighton said: ‘You get in to all sorts of
 strange precedents if people aren’t satisfied with what they see – it 
is very grey and dangerous territory.’
