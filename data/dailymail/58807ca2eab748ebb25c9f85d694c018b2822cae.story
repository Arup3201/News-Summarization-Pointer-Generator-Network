Crews are continuing their frantic search for dozens of victims still missing after Saturday's landslide in Washington - but authorities say they may have to leave some bodies buried.

Search crews using dogs, bulldozers 
and their bare hands are slogging through the mess of broken wood and 
mud, looking for more bodies or anyone who might still 
be alive nearly five days after a wall of fast-moving earth destroyed a 
small rural community.

Authorities have said that recovering every corpse would be impractical and dangerous - and now families are being forced to accept that their loved ones might never be found.

The
 debris field is about a square mile and 30 to 40 feet deep in places, 
with a moon-like surface that includes quicksand-like muck, 
rain-slickened mud and ice. The terrain is difficult to navigate on foot
 and makes it treacherous or impossible to bring in heavy equipment.

To
 make matters worse, the pile is laced with other hazards that include 
fallen trees, propane and septic tanks, twisted vehicles and countless 
shards of shattered homes.

'We
 have to get on with our lives at some point,' said Becky Bach, who has spent 
the past several days in the area in hopes that searchers would find her
 brother, his wife, her 20-year-old great niece and the young girl's 
fiance.

Sixteen bodies have 
been recovered, but authorities believe at least 24 people were killed. 
Scores of others are still unaccounted for, although many of those 
names were believed to be duplicates.

 Massingale is among those waiting for word about his 4-month-old 
granddaughter. Searchers were able to identify carpet from the infant's 
bedroom, but a log jam stood in the way of a more thorough effort to 
find little Sanoah Huestis, known as 'Snowy'.

'It
 just generates so many questions if they don't find them,' Bach said. 
'I've never known anybody to die in a natural disaster. Do they issue 
death certificates?'

'Realistically...I honestly don't think 
they're going to find them alive. But as a family, we're trying to 
figure out what to do if they find no bodies.'

Bach
 spoke via phone about a wedding the family had planned for summer at 
the rural home that was destroyed. And how, she wondered, do you plan a 
funeral without a body?

'We'll probably just have a memorial, and if they find the bodies eventually, then we'll deal with that then,' she said.

In previous mudslides, many victims 
were left where they perished. Mudslides killed thousands in Venezuela 
in 1999, and about 1,500 bodies were found. But the death toll was 
estimated at 5,000 to 30,000, so the government declared entire 
neighborhoods 'memorial grounds'.

As families grieved, officials were 
questioned again Wednesday about warnings from years ago that showed the
 potential for catastrophic landslides in the area.

A
 1999 report by geomorphologist Daniel Miller raised questions about why
 residents were allowed to build homes in the area and whether officials
 had taken proper precautions.

Snohomish
 County Emergency Management Director John Pennington said authorities 
took steps to mitigate risks after a 2006 landslide and told residents 
about potential hazards. But the sheer size of this disaster was 
overwhelming.

'It haunts 
me,' a sometimes-emotional Pennington told reporters. 'I think we did 
what we could do. Sometimes large slides happen.'

Remembering: Jammi Parris, a waitress at the Blue Bird Cafe in downtown Arlington, paints a yellow ribbon and the words 'Hold on to Hope' on the window of the cafe in tribute to the victims

He
 said the landslide risk has been high this winter, and the Department 
of Natural Resources put out warnings on a routine basis.

Officials will try to learn from this tragedy, he said.

Meanwhile, hundreds of rescuers kept slogging through the muck, following search dogs over the unstable surface of the immense pile.

For the last three days, 'the most effective tool has been dogs and just our bare hands and shovels uncovering people,' Snohomish County District 21 Fire Chief Travis Hots said.

'But the dogs are the ones that are pinpointing a particular area to look, and we're looking and that's how we're finding people.'

Massingale said he's grateful that his daughter, Natasha Huestis, survived the slide. She had gone to Arlington that morning and left her baby with her mother, Christina Jefferds. Her husband Seth, a volunteer firefighter, was also away at the time.

'She didn't suffer,' Massingale said after he was told about Christina's death.

Massingale said he would miss his first grandchild, a sweet, pretty and smiley child.

'It's stressful to think about,' he said. 'A little baby that hasn't gotten a start yet in life. It's too much.'
