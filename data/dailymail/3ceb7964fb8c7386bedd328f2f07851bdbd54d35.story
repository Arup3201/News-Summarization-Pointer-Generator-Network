Last year it was all about the ramen burger. But one month into 2015 and New York already has a new It sandwich.

M. Wells Dinette, the French-Canadian restaurant at MoMA's PS1 outpost in Long Island City, has been selling up to 100 of its $13 spaghetti sandwiches per day since it was listed on the menu a week ago.

The dish sees spaghetti in a tomato-garlic sauce take the place of a patty. The noodles are mixed with pecorino cheese then coated in egg and baked in a blini pan to hold them together.

The new ramen burger? M. Wells Dinette, in New York's Long Island City, has been selling up to 100 of its $13 spaghetti sandwiches per day since it was listed on the menu a week ago

'The result is crispy on the outside, and very juicy on the inside,' chef Aidan O'Neal told the New York Post. 'We serve it on a toasted onion roll with extremely delicious garlic butter and a layer of chopped Caesar salad with red pepper flakes.'

Of course, this is no diet food. Carb-loading aside, the spaghetti sandwich packs a punch in terms of calories too. A member of staff at the restaurant told us that they try to fit as much  between the bread as possible. This equates to around an appetizer-sized portion of pasta (420 calories according to Calorieking.com) and the same of salad (204 calories). Add the bun (150 calories), pecorino (20 calories) a generous lick of garlic butter (102 calories) and a side of potato chips (160 calories) and the total calories are a shade over 1,000.

The concept of the spaghetti sandwich is not actually a new one. The brainchild of restaurant owner Hugue Dufour, it was originally listed on the menu four years ago - much to the chefs' disdain.

'We cooks all kind of scoffed at the idea,' Mr O'Neal told the Post. 'But he was right; it's very, very good.'

The spaghetti sandwich fell off the menu a year ago after the restaurant decided to focus more on seasonal ingredients, but following a surge of complaints from regulars, it was reinstated last month.

And the demand has been unprecedented, Mr O'Neal says: 'It's been insane. We'll get get a ticket to fire up seven at a time for one table, and then another will come in, and another.'

In the interests of research, the Femail team took a trip to Long Island City in order to put the sandwich to the test.

A little wary of the heavy carb-on-carb action, we figured one sandwich between two would suffice. In fact, it turned out to be carb-on-carb-on-carb as the sandwich was served with homemade potato chips.

But one bite in and we were both sold. The combination of textures made perfect sense in reality, if not in concept.

'It was so much tastier than I was expecting,' said Charlie Lankston, Femail's U.S. Assistant Editor. 'And it wasn't anywhere near as "carby" as I thought it would be either. The tomato sauce was delicious, and the tangy Caesar dressing really helped to cut through the carbs while adding an extra flavor dimension to the overall taste.'

Daters beware though - the spaghetti sandwich is is not a first date dish. 

'Maybe save it for the third?' Charlie suggested. 'It was incredibly messy to eat, but well worth the tomato stains on my cheeks - and something I would actually eat again.'
