Expensive holiday: Georgia Harris' phone was stolen in Barcelona and while she was in the air on her way back to Britain the thieves racked up a £21,000 bill

A recruitment worker whose phone was stolen while she was on holiday is facing a £21,000 bill.

Georgia Harris racked up the huge bill after her mobile was taken and then used to make premium rate international calls.

The 23-year-old realised her phone had been taken when she arrived back in Britain after a trip to Barcelona.

She lost her phone in the morning and the thief only took a few hours while she was in the air to rack up the staggering bill.

As soon as Miss Harris realised her Samsung Galaxy had been stolen, she immediately called police and her phone company to report the theft and visited a store a few hours later to pick up a replacement.

She discovered the thief’s abuse of her account when Vodafone staff informed her that it had been suspended for ‘suspicious activity’.

They revealed her service had been stopped when the bill totalled £21,183.82.

Records show the thief had used the phone for several conference calls to premium rate international numbers from 7.52am on the day it was lost.

Miss Harris, from Worthing, West Sussex, arrived at Gatwick Airport a few hours later, following a holiday in Barcelona to celebrate a friend's birthday, at around 1pm, reporting the theft shortly after.

She said: ‘I went into the store to pick up my replacement phone and the customer assistant told me that the phone had been locked.

‘He looked at the account further and his mouth dropped open. I thought that someone might have used the phone and racked up a bill of hundreds of pounds.

‘But then he said it was £21,000. I just couldn't believe it. I phoned Vodafone and they kept saying that I was liable to the point when I reported it stolen.

‘I didn't realise it was stolen until I reached Gatwick. They kept talking about payment plans. It is such a lot of money.

‘I didn't think it was possible to run up such a huge bill. It is the size of a house deposit.’

Miss Harris was shocked when Vodafone customer services insisted that she was responsible for the bill, saying the company should have suspended the account earlier.

‘A couple of hundreds of pounds maybe, or a thousand, but £21,000 is crazy.

‘I just can't believe they didn't suspend the account when it began running into thousands of pounds.

‘Vodafone said that because I was abroad, it didn't show up on my bill for 24 hours. I find it hard that a global company in an age where everything is instant can say that.

‘I shouldn't have to pay for their computer system not updating.’

Vodafone initially offered to reduce Miss Harris' bill by £1,500 as a ‘goodwill gesture’ - leaving her to pay more than £19,500, but after investigation a the company said that all fees to her account will be waived.

A spokesman  said: ‘This is a very unusual case. Normally, the customer is liable for any charges up to the point they report their phone lost or stolen.

‘However, this phone seems to have been used as part of a deliberate and organised crime which we will be investigating.

‘In this case, we will waive all of the charges raised by this fraud.

‘It's worth remembering how important it is to keep your phone safe, and get in touch with us as soon as you suspect it's missing.’
