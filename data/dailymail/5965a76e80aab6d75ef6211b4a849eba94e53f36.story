Arsenal legend Thierry Henry gave fans at Anfield a glimpse of his very, very best after nailing a cheeky pass to Ryan Babel during an All-Stars game between a Steven Gerrard XI and a Jamie Carragher XI.

The former Arsenal man hung up his boots in December, but there was no sign of rustiness as the 37-year-old former France international pulled off the audacious move.

Henry, who had been playing for MLS side New York Red Bulls before calling it a day, looked set to pull the trigger after picking up the ball on the edge of the box, only to dummy a shot with his right and play a pass with his left.

Babel was the man to benefit from the pass as it rolled perfectly to his feet, but the Dutchman dragged his effort wide in a manner Liverpool fans had become fully accustomed to during his time on Merseyside.

The first goal of the game had been scored by Mario Balotelli and a cracker it was too, the Italian whipping a 25-yard drive that fizzed into the corner of The Kop net on nine minutes. He wasn’t put under great pressure but the finish still smacked of class.

At one stage it looked as if Carragher’s side, managed by Roy Evans, would saunter to victory but Gerrard has made comebacks a fixture of his Liverpool career and he ensured this match did not end in defeat.

A second penalty of the afternoon followed for Gerrard and he duly converted that one too to level the scores at Anfield Stadium

He scored two penalties, one in the 36th minute after Martin Kelly had adjudged to trip Jerome Sinclair and another just after the hour when Carragher quite clearly barged Luis Suarez over. Some would say the Sportsmail columnist was lucky not to make it into Lee Probert’s book.

The icing on the cake would have been a goal for either Torres or Suarez but, despite the best efforts of the Uruguayan in particular, it never arrived. No matter. A draw was an appropriate end to a memorable day. The smiles on the faces as a lap of honour was completed confirmed that.

Afterwards Gerrard told LFC TV: 'It has been absolute brilliant, more than anything the charities have done well with a full house.

'The hairs on my neck were standing up. There were times I didn't know who to pass to. People have gone out of their way to come here.

'It has been absolutely magical. Every player who was asked to come here did, whether they had to drive for an hour or get three flights.'
