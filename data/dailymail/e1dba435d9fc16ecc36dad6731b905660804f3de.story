Lawrence O'Donnell, host of NBC's The Last Word returns to TV today two months after surviving a car crash.

O'Donnell who is now in Los Angeles joined Alex Wagner of NBC to discuss his return which she quipped is 'more bearded than ever.'

When asked about his experience during his two month leave, O'Donnell said he suffered some difficult times but that overall it was 'a pretty great two months.'

'As you know I am not a workaholic,' he joked.

'I am not the first one in the building every morning,' he added.

He also called his time away a 'real clearing of the head,' and said that he knows 'no news,' except for information about The Tony Awards.

He told Alex that in the past hour before his appearance he had 'retained no news,' to which she responded he was the 'Rip Van Winkle' of the news world to whom all news would be eye-opening.

Alex noted how the lighting of the Los Angeles studio made him look better than ever.

He then joked that the lighting was 'better than plastic surgery.'

His studio is in Universal City at The Universal Studios lot where 'movie making' happens.

Even though he's spending time in L.A., O'Donnell said that he would be in New York often.

Before saying goodbye, Alex asked O'Donnell what the one thing he's missed the last two months would be.

Thinking she asked him what he would miss about being away he responded, 'Painkillers work.'

'That would be the one thing.'

Lawrence O'Donnell sported a more clean-cut and serious look before the crash

After a month away in a hospital following a car accident, MSNBC host Lawrence O’Donnell called into his show The Last Word Wednesday on May 14 to reveal that he suffered a broken hip.

When O'Donnell and his brother, Michael, were traveling abroad they got into an accident while riding in a taxi April 15.

After flying home to the U.S., Lawrence O'Donnell, 62, has been getting treatment in New York and Michael has been hospitalized in their native Boston.

The veteran TV presenter's colleague Alex took over 'The Last Word' on Tuesdays and Ari Melber has been filing in Wednesdays and Thursdays.

On Wednesday May 14, Melber got a surprise on the air when his injured co-worker called into the show to offer viewers an update on his condition.

The 3-minute exchange with Melber was punctuated with quips and sarcastic jabs, proving that while O'Donnell may have fractured his hip, his sense of humor remained intact.

‘One thing I want everybody to know is that Carl Rove's rumor that I’ve had brain damage… that is completely untrue, so make sure that goes away,’ O’Donnell told Melber, poking fun at the Republican strategist over his recent comments about Hillary Clinton’s health.

After a few seconds of friendly banter, O'Donnell promised to provide additional information on his eminent comeback next week after he meets with his surgeon.

The 62-year-old political analyst shed light on his physical state, saying that the taxi collision left him with a fractured hip and injuries to his legs that required surgery for the first time in his life.

After trading a few friendly jabs with Melber, whom O’Donnell jokingly called out for being more concerned with his vacation time than with his colleague's health, The Last Word host revealed that he is expected to be back on air in June. 

‘That would be great because then I could make vacation plans,’ Melber quipped.

‘Of course, this of course is really all about you. Never mind that I was the one who was in the car crash,’ O’Donnell retorted in jest.

O’Donnell added that now that he is feeling more energetic, he will continue calling into the show and may even join Skype so that his viewers could see him on screen-which they did today in a professional studio.

Get well gifts: O'Donnell shared a photo of these flowers (left) sent to the hospital by the team from Morning Joe, and he joked that Bill O'Reilly's book Killing Jesus (right) is just what he needs to fall asleep 

‘And remember: I have access to the control room, so any time, when you least expect it - like right now - I could end up being your next guest,’ O’Donnell warned. 

O’Donnell finished the chat by asking viewers to stay with MSNBC ‘for more of The Last Word with the hardest working man in cable news, Ari Melber.’

‘This is so great to get back in the saddle this way,’ O’Donnell gushed about doing the tease.

While the host has been away from the small screen for the past two months, he has remained active on Twitter, answering viewers’ questions about his recovery and commenting on the news of the day.

In response to a fan's query on Twitter in May, Mr O'Donnell said that his brother is recovering on schedule, and that he was discharged from the hospital the day before.

On May 5, he tweeted that he was learning how to walk with crutches after spending weeks getting around in a wheelchair and then with the help of a walker.

O’Donnell followed up three days later with a message thanking his 'heroic' nurses and a 'brilliant' physical therapist.

O’Donnell also revealed to his 241,000 followers that he is now sporting a full beard since he has not shaved since the accident. 

Lawrence O'Donnell has hosted the 10pm news analysis show since 2010. He is married and has a daughter.

It is unclear where the O'Donnells were when the accident took place, and the left-leaning host did not leave any clues about his trip on his Twitter feed.
