New Yorkers with musophobia - the fear of rats - should look away now.

The irrational fear of rats, in New York City where there are an estimated two times as many rats are there are people, may not seem so crazy after a look at the New York City Health Department's Rat Information Portal, or RIP.

The dense human population means rats thrive in New York, roaming city streets by night, hanging out in subway tunnels and feasting on curbside garbage.

Ratted out: New Yorkers can check the rat infestation of any part of the city with RIP

In the red: This area around East Houston Street has some rodent issues

To discover the extent to which any neighborhood or building is infested, residents and businesses can look at raw data gathered by the city's Health Department.

Rat Indexing is an inspection process carried out by the Health Department as a part of the Rat Initiative.

Inspectors look at all the properties in a given area for active rat signs and conditions conducive to rats.

Rat rank: Around lower Manhattan is relatively slim pickings for rats

Midtown: The area between 31st Street and 38th Street is a sea of yellow - indicating it passed inspection

Once the information is collated, the Department generates maps of neighborhoods to identify rat hot spots.

Residents can check their neighborhood's infestation level by plugging their address into the RIP.

The rat-phobic will want to stay away from blocks and buildings marked in red, which indicate active rat signs.

Clicking on an area of the map will then reveal inspection dates, actions and results.

The interactive heat map of rat inspection data can be used to look up the rat history, going back to 2009, of any address within the five boroughs.

Overrun: New York's rats have been known to overtake restaurants at night

Humans and rats have been living side-by-side for thousands of years in a kind of uneasy truce, but Animal Planet has named New York City the worst rat city in the world.

Rats in New York have been known to overrun restaurants after hours, crawl up sewer pipes and enter apartments through toilets. They have also attacked homeless people, eaten cadavers in the city morgue, and bitten infants to get food off their faces, according to author Robert Sullivan.

For those interested in rat management, the Health Department's Rodent Academy offers two courses in rat control - a half day class and the three-day course.
