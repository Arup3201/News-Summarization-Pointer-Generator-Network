WhatsApp first hinted it would let users make free calls to each other early last year.

Now Android users can make voice calls and the feature will come to iOS soon.

The latest version of the popular messaging app also has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts, chats and calls.

The latest version of WhatsApp has a cleaner layout with three tabs for contacts, chats and calls. Users simply have to click on the ‘Calls’ tab and choose a contact to phone a friend at no cost.

However this only works between WhatsApp users and it relies on an internet connection.

The update hasn’t yet been confirmed by the Mountain View, California-based company, but users of the app have taken to Twitter to confirm its appearance on their Android handsets.

Bertie C in London, said: ‘Whatsapp have calls now this is just too much #wificalling #WhatsAppCalls,’ while Dhanesh Nair tweeted: ‘Finally whatsapp call activated..#WhatsAppCalls’

Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) lets people make free, or low cost, telephone calls over the web.

Popular VoIP services include Viber and Skype.

VoIP can be used anywhere in the world and can call landline and mobile numbers.

However, some people say they cannot see the update, which is available from the Google Play Store or WhatsApp’s site, indicating that it may not have rolled out everywhere yet.

And some users aren’t that impressed.

Fahida Khan tweeted: ‘#WhatsAppCalls why??? Everyone has unlimited mins these days,’ while another user said: ‘Tried #WhatsAppCalls it’s good only if u have good internet speed.'

The 'Calls' feature requires an internet connection and works in a similar way to how Skype connects web-based calls - a service known as 'voice over internet protocol' or VoIP.

Other messaging apps, including Viber, already offer free voice and video calls to users, and it's believed WhatsApp's update is designed to rival such services.

The feature is expected to be available for iPhone users ‘in a couple of weeks,’ The Verge reported.

WhatsApp rolled out the feature to selected users in January and a screenshot revealed how the service would look on a Nexus 5 handset, in February.

The image showed the new ‘Calls’ tab and is incredibly similar to the newly updated version.

In December, Dutch site AndroidWorld uncovered clues about the feature while studying the app's test code. It then extracted layout files from the raw code to create mock-up screenshots (pictured). The new tool was only available to select users, but if someone with the feature called someone without it, it forced the update

Skype was one of the first firms to make VoIP a mainstream technology, and last year it launched a translator. 

The beta version of its live translation tool lets people speak to others in another language - even if they don’t know what they’re saying. 

The tool then translates speech instantly, providing both text and spoken translations. 

The public version launched with English and Spanish translations, but the Microsoft-owned firm is looking to add more than 40 languages to the service. 

Google also recently added a live translation tool to is Google Translate app and this could be the next step for messaging apps such as Viber and Whatsapp. 

Last year, WhatsApp updated its service to make it harder to avoid messages. The Facebook-owned app displays two blue ticks in the bottom right-hand corner of an individual message to show it has been read. 

WhatsApp has overtaken traditional mobile phone texts for the first time as users send 30 billion messages every day.

The app allows people to send instant messages and photographs via the internet rather without incurring charges from their network provider.

Its growing popularity saw people send 30 billion WhatsApp messages a day last year, compared to 20 billion SMS text messages, according to research by The Economist.

Messaging apps have exploded in popularity over the last few years thanks to the growth of smartphones and 3G and 4G allowing fast internet connection.

But the move is predicted to hit telecoms firms hard.

Research company Ovum found that the decline in the use of traditional text messages in favour of messaging apps was estimated to cost mobile network providers $54 billion by 2016.

Last year, WhatsApp, which was only founded in 2009, was bought by Facebook for $19 billion - the most ever paid for a venture-capital-backed company. It was the social networking giant's biggest acquisition to date.

In a statement announcing the deal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg described WhatsApp's services as 'incredibly valuable'.

WhatsApp has more than 450 million monthly users and claims it is currently registering one million new users a day.

It makes money by charging users a subscription fee of $1 per year, although it offers a free model as well.
