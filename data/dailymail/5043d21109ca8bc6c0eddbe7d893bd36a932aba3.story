A New Jersey dental assistant is filing a $5million lawsuit against the Gansevoort Hotel and a Belgian tourist after she was stabbed in the leg with a stiletto while partying at the ritzy hotel this past summer.

Amanda Keisoglu was celebrating a cousin's bachelorette party with a group of 12 friends at the hotel's rooftop bar Plunge when intoxicated tourist Marie Thys of Belgium got into a fight with  someone near their bottle-service table.

The 26-year-old told the New York Post that she didn't know Thys 'whatsoever' but that didn't stop the woman from bringing her into the fight.

Heel! Marie Thys of Belgium allegedly lodged her stiletto heel into Amanda Keisoglu’s thigh while drunk at the Gansevoort Hotel’s rooftop bar this past August

'I felt my wrist get pulled, and it forced me to turn around,' Keisoglu said. 'Then she kicked my inner thigh.' 

And that stiletto stayed jammed into her left leg until someone pulled Thys off of her. 

That's when her leg started spurting blood and she had to plug up the wound with her own finger. 

Lawsuit: Keisoglu is now suing the Gansevoort hotel (pictured) and Thys for $5million

A friend helped her to the restroom and she was eventually taken to the hospital where she received intravenous antibiotics for her injury. 

The wound was too deep for stitches and she remained hospitalized for three to four days after the run-in. 

Keisoglu says she still attends physical therapy for the injury and is now suing both Thys and the hotel for not adequately preventing the fight. 

She says Thys was 'was visibly intoxicated for several hours prior to the attack' but the bar at the Plunge continued to keep serving her even though she was 'belligerent and violent against other patrons for some time prior to the attack,' the suit filed in Manhattan Supreme Court reads.

'I thought I’d be safe there,' she said. 'I feel like this could have been prevented.'
