you can't all be like me: Christine Lagarde said that anybody attempting to balance motherhood and a career should accept there would be 'failures'

She is a mother of two and one of the most powerful women in the world.

But Christine Lagarde has said that women cannot have it all when it comes to juggling career and family life.

The head of the International Monetary Fund – the first woman to hold the post – said that anybody attempting to balance motherhood and a career should accept there would be ‘failures’.

She also admitted that despite her position men still talk to her in a patronising way, and that she is forced to 'grit her teeth' and get on with it.

Lagarde's comments are surprising as if there is one woman among world leaders who has apparently had it all - and with ease - it would be her.

As head of the IMF the 56-year-old is in charge of negotiations to save the Euro and bailout Greece.

But she is also famous for her life outside of work and has been profiled in Vogue magazine and sat in the front row for Paris fashion shows.

Before heading the IMF Lagarde was Minister of Finance in France and rose to become chairman of Chicago law firm Baker & McKenzie, one of the biggest legal companies in America.

Speaking to US TV network NBC Lagarde said: 'I think you cannot have it at the same time.

Not easy: She also admitted that despite her position men still talk to her in a patronising way, and that she is forced to 'grit her teeth' and get on with it

'I think you can in a way have it all as long as you can afford to be patient. But you cannot have it all at the same time.

'You must accept there will be failures.'

The only casualty along Lagarde's path to success appears to have been her marriage - she is divorced but is living with her new partner in Washington.

She still however plays an active role in the lives of her sons Pierre-Henri, 26, and Thomas, 24, who have not followed her into politics.

Lagarde first became a mother aged 30 when she was still trying to climb the ladder at Baker & McKenzie.

Colleagues told her that she was too young to become a partner in the firm but she persisted anyway.

She is currently ranked eighth most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in first place.

A former synchronised swimmer, silver-haired Lagarde is still slim and 6ft tall and credits being in good physical health for managing her hectic life.

In the interview she was asked that, despite her power, were there men who treat her in patronising way.

Lagarde said: 'Oh yeah, of course.

'I don't want to embarrass them (by naming them).

'The best defence when that happens is a very good and solid sense of humour. At the end of the day, they are human beings as well.

'They have wives, they have daughters.'

Lagarde added that she often fell back on the mantra repeated to her by her synchronised swimming coach: 'When it's tough, grit your teeth and smile'.
