Want to eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper? Well now London's Ritz Hotel can make two of the three come true and nobody really wants the last one anyway.

This is a hotel stay like no other.

The famous venue is offering a two-night package, which includes kingly breakfasts and also an exclusive trip to Highgrove House, the private
 residence of The Prince of Wales and the Duchess
 of Cornwall.

At Highgrove guests will be treated to a private tour and lunch, so really can eat like Prince Charles himself.

Highgrove House is opening its doors as part of an exclusive package at The Ritz

The price for this one-off experience? A mere snip at £2,660 for two. But hurry as there's a maximum of 40 spaces available.

And the 'Hightail it to Highgrove' package, which runs from August 3-6, is only open for booking until June 6.

Although the Prince and Camilla aren't scheduled to be home in Gloucestershire, but you never know when they might pop along to their country estate for a moment of peace and quiet.

And who knows what goes on behind closed doors at the royal residence but if you are one of the few lucky visitors, just remember, what happens at Highgrove, stays at Highgrove.

But, even if your visit isn't wild, it will certainly be picturesque.

The private
 residence of Their Royal Highnesses The Prince of Wales and the Duchess
 of Cornwall is famed for its beautiful gardens.

Of
 course, they are manicured to perfection using only sustainable 
gardening methods.

It's no surprise that Prince Charles has coupled up with The Ritz
 for this exclusive experience as the the alliance goes back a long way.

The Ritz was the first hotel in the world to be awarded the royal warrant by His Royal Highness over a decade ago in 2002, and it's the second year in a row that The Ritz and the Royals have teamed up on the 'Hightail to Highgrove' package.

It may be pricey but it's also priceless. Who's in?
