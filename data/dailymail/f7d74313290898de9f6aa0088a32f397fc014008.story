The Prince of Wales today wore his army fatigues to watch soldiers of the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland in action

As Prince William hangs up his uniform to spend more time with his family, Prince Charles today put his back on for a visit to the 7th Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland.

Acting in his role as Royal Colonel of the regiment, the Prince watched soldiers compete in a falling plate competition before awarding a trophy to the winning team.

The Prince, who has served in both the Navy and the Air Force, then met with soldiers of the 7th Battalion at Barry Buddon Training Centre in Carnoustie, Scotland.

An Army spokesman said: 'When a Royal Colonel visits a unit it's always very much appreciated that they wear their uniform, especially when the regiment is practising their skills out in the field.

'It's always good for Royal Colonels to see the soldiers in training.'

It was just a drop-in visit though as the Prince then had to travel to Cardiff to lead the congregation at an emotional service for fallen police officers to mark National Police Memorial Day.

Charles, patron of the event, attended the 10th annual service and joined a reception for families and colleagues of officers at St David's Hall in Cardiff in Wales.

National Police Memorial Day is an annual remembrance event to honour all officers killed in the line of duty since modern policing began in 1792.

A mounted police honour guard greeted Charles when he arrived in Cardiff, along with members of the public who had gathered around the hall.

Charles, accompanied by the Lord Lieutenant Dr Peter Beck and Chief Constable Peter Vaughan of South Wales Police, then attended the memorial service in the Concert Hall.

The service was also attended by representatives from the Home Offices of all four UK countries, including Home Secretary Theresa May and First Minister Carwyn Jones, who both delivered readings.

Among those remembered was Metropolitan Police officer Pc Andrew Duncan, 47, who was killed in a suspected hit-and-run collision last week.

Greater Manchester Police Constables Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone, brutally murdered in a gun and grenade attack last September, were also honoured.

In a statement, Charles said: 'The tragic deaths of Ian Dibell, Nicola Hughes and Fiona Bone last year have reinforced just how dangerous the Police Service can be.

'Our courageous policemen and women routinely endure hazardous environments in order to defend us and protect all our freedoms.

'But there is nothing routine about the courage they display.

'Indeed, to all those who keep us safe, and to their families, we owe a debt of gratitude that we can never repay.

'They will never be forgotten and their proud legacy inspires us and will always live on.'

During the service Ms Hughes' stepmother, Natalie Hughes, read a prayer.

Sgt Joe Holness, founder of the National Police Memorial Day, said it was 'crucial' for Charles to mark the day with bereaved colleagues and family.

He said: 'It is significant that the Prince of Wales overturned a moratorium in 2000 which was placed there after the Queen Mother died, meaning he was banned from taking on any other organisations as a patron.

'In 2006 I made an approach to him and he agreed to be patron because of the unique service the police provides.

'I think the fact that the nation is stopping and remembering the commitment of the fallen officers means a great deal to their families, friends and colleagues.

'It doesn't bring back the officers they have lost but it gives some small comfort and recognition of what that family has given."

Sgt Holness said around 4,000 police officers had given their lives in the line of duty since modern policing records began in 1792.

'There are between ten and 15 fallen officers every year,' he said. 'It is not too much to ask for one day a year to be set aside to remember their commitment to the public.'

Charles became Patron of the National Police Memorial Day in 2006 and last attended the annual memorial service in Glasgow in Scotland in 2011.

Sgt Holness, a serving officer with Kent Police, initiated plans for the Memorial Day in May 2001, following the brutal death of colleague Constable Jon Odell.

Pc Odell was killed when he was struck by a car in Margate in December 2000.

The inaugural Memorial Day was held at St Paul's Cathedral on Sunday October 3 2004.

Services have since been held across the UK each year, on the nearest Sunday to Saint Michael's Day, the patron saint of police. The service was last held in Cardiff in 2009.

Steve Williams, Chairman, Police Federation of England and Wales, said it was important to recognise the sacrifice made by officers.

Mr Williams said: 'Policing can sometimes be very dangerous. When people go to work you expect them to come home at the end of the day. Sometimes in the policing world, this is not the case.

'It is right that the public are reminded of the dedication to duty.

'I am so proud to be here today, as a Welshman. It is being held in Wales, we have the Prince of Wales here - it means a great deal.'
