Luis Suarez has been told August 8 is the confirmed date when he will learn his fate over the four month ban imposed by FIFA.

The Uruguayan, who bit the Italian defender during the World Cup group stage last month, signed for Barcelona from Liverpool after the incident, but is banned until the end of October.

The tribunal has been called for this date by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne, and will represent Suarez's last chance to reduce the ban.

Under the conditions of the ban, Suarez cannot partake in any footballing activity for another three months, including training and being unveiled as Barcelona's record signing.

Suarez, his lawyers and Barcelona will hope the £75million star can see his ban reduced and return to action as soon as possible, particularly to allow for a formal presentation at the Nou Camp.

Suarez has hired a personal trainer in order for him to retain his fitness ahead of his return to action.
