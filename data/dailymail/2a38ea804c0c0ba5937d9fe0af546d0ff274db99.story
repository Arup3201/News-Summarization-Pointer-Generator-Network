The Quadrantid meteor shower is due overnight in the U.S. - and forecasters expect night owls could be treated to a spectacular display in the hours just before dawn, weather permitting.

The waxing moon will stop sky watchers seeing too much until the hours after 3am local time in the East - but from then until dawn, meteors should be visible. Skywatchers on the West coast might be able to catch a less intense shower, again just before dawn.

Quadrantid Meteor Shower pictured over Bow Valley, Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada in 2009: Although the shower is often spectacular, it's very brief - and many often miss the shower of up to 200 meteors per hour, which can be visible to the naked eye

The Quadrantid shower is one of the 
year's most spectacular, but also the shower that most astronomers miss -
 it's very brief and intense.

Skywatchers on the East coast can expect to see between 50 and 100 meteors per hour.

On the West, the shower will have begun to dwindle by the time the moon sets, so the rate of meteors will have slowed to between 25 and 50.

Nasa says, 'Peaking in the wee morning hours, the Quadrantids have a maximum rate of about 100 per hour, varying between 60-200.'

'The waxing gibbous moon will set around 3 a.m. local time, leaving about two hours of excellent meteor observing before dawn. It's a good thing, too, because unlike the more famous Perseid and Geminid meteor showers, the Quadrantids only last a few hours -- it's the morning of January 4th, or nothing.'Like the Geminids, the Quadrantids originate from an asteroid, called 2003 EH1.

Dynamical studies suggest that this body could very well be a piece of a comet which broke apart several centuries ago, and that the meteors you will see before dawn are the debris from this fragmentation.

After hundreds of years orbiting the sun, they will enter our atmosphere at 90,000 mph, burning up 50 miles above Earth's surface.
