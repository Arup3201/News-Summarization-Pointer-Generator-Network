Tony Poole, famously cleared of murder after serving 13 years in prison, has been convicted of killing another man

A man famously cleared of murder after serving 13 years in prison has been found guilty of killing another man.

Tony Poole, 52, was released in June 2003 when Appeal Court judges quashed his conviction for murdering Hensley Wiltshire in January 1989.

But a jury at Bristol Crown Court today acquitted him of murdering his friend Martin Stokes, 30, at a flat in Gloucester in January this year.

Many members of the jury wept as they convicted Poole of Mr Stokes' manslaughter and unlawfully wounding another friend, Ben Clark, 47.

Poole claimed self-defence, stating he only armed himself with two knives and lashed out kung-fu style - stabbing Mr Stokes in the eye - after fearing he would be attacked himself.

During the three-week trial, the cocaine user told jurors: 'In the world I live in you can stab people if they are going to stab you.'

As Mr Stokes attempted to evade Poole, he fell from the window of the ground floor flat and plummeted into the basement stairwell below.

Poole then stabbed Mr Clark once in the chest before fleeing the property in  Gloucester, taking the weapons with him.

Witnesses described seeing a bare-chested man with his fists clenched and arms stretched out 'like a gorilla' leaving the scene shouting: 'If I go down for it, I go down for it'.

Members of the public who rushed to Mr Stokes' aid saw he was heavily blood-stained and had suffered a serious eye injury.

By the time Mr Stokes arrived at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital he was already unconscious and unresponsive. He died eight days later on January 21.

Poole, of Gloucester, denied charges of murdering Mr Stokes and wounding Mr Clark with intent.

He refused to attend court to hear the jury's majority verdict of manslaughter and unlawful wounding, delivered after nine hours and 43 minutes of deliberations.

'It was three against one. I picked up two knives from the kitchen side to arm myself against these three,' Poole told the court.

CCTV footage showed a bare chested Poole leaving the scene of the crime on January 13

Speaking after the case, Detective Chief Inspector Ruth Mather, who led the investigation, said Poole had shown 'no remorse' for his actions.

'He has shown absolutely no remorse since and has only ever seemed concerned about himself,' Mrs Mather said.

'While in custody for this offence he wanted to control things and, despite telling us that Martin Stokes was his best friend, he showed no remorse for killing him.

'As an individual he is somebody, who even among his friends, there is a danger.'

Mr Stokes’ mother, Tania Simmonds, said his children would miss his 'love and affection'.

'The only way I can cope with the dreadful way in which he died is to block the images of his horrific injuries and suffering out of my head,' she said.

Mr Stokes’ stepmother, Annie Stokes, paid tribute to him, adding: 'Our lives will never be the same'.

'Martin was good company and fun to be with,' she said. 'He found it difficult to be still, and would be animated, entertaining us with his antics.

'The impact of losing Martin on me and the family has been huge. My mental health and that of his sisters has been adversely affected.'

Poole said: 'They mocked me, Ben primarily: "What are you going to do with that?" Martin was saying: "Go on then, stab me". That's when he said he had been stabbed before.

'He was moving around saying "Go on, f****** kill me" and he took a step towards me with the knife and I lashed out and obviously stabbed him with what I call a hammer fist blow.

'As soon as I delivered the blow Mr Clark stepped up towards me so I stabbed him in the shoulder. I remember him saying "You're proper f***** now".

'It happened so fast. I said to Ben "Come at me again and I'll stab you again". I was very frightened. I looked into Martin's eyes and (what) I could see was fear, he was frightened.'

Despite admitting his actions, Poole said he never intended injury or death and claimed the two were his friends

Asked how he felt about the double stabbing, Poole replied: 'Devastated that this had happened. They were my friends. It just got out of hand, I just couldn't believe it that they would really start on me.

'I reacted how I knew I had to. I never intended any injury or death.'

The court heard that Poole's compensation money was running out and he was looking to sell his house, having spent it indulging his lifestyle, including 'sex parties' involving cocaine and women.

CCTV shows Poole walking through Gloucester city centre bare chested and he later repeatedly demonstrated to police how he lashed out at Mr Stokes.

Poole was originally jailed with co-defendant Gary Mills for the murder of Mr Wiltshire during a fight at a flat in  Tredworth, Gloucester.

Mr Mills, who died in 2012 aged 53, maintained he had always acted in self-defence after being attacked by Mr Wiltshire while Poole said he never took part in the fight.

They always protested their innocence but refused the chance to be released on licence after serving their minimum 10-year tariffs until their case was re-examined by the courts.

Family and friends launched the Set up For Life campaign to fight for the men’s release and were successful in June 2003 when the Court of Appeal ruled the convictions were unsafe.

Their case had been referred to the Appeal Court by the Criminal Cases Review Commission, which investigates possible miscarriages of justice.

Lord Justice Auld, Mr Justice Keith and Mr Justice Simon allowed their appeals on two grounds relating to non-disclosure of material and a document wrongly put before the jury which was 'unfairly prejudicial' to the defence of both men.

Although there had been 'misconduct' by a senior officer in the case, the judges ruled that there was no evidence of any 'systemic' dishonesty in the investigation 'such as to undermine the integrity of the prosecution as a whole'.

After being released, Poole said: 'From what I can see, the judgment doesn’t really go nearly in depth as it should in damning the police.

'There is some criticism there but it falls short. I’m not overly happy - it’s not enough.'
