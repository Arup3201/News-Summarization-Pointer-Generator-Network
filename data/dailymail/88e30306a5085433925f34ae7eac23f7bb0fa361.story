An Arizona court has heard the voicemails that a former socialite left for her ex-boyfriend after she allegedly hired him to kill her ex-husband so that she could cash out on his $2million life insurance policy.

Pamela Phillips is on trial for the murder of her ex-husband Gary Triano who was killed in 1996 after a pipe bomb exploded when he got into his car at a Tucson country club.

State prosecutors have accused Phillips, now 56, of hiring her ex-boyfriend Ron Young to kill Triano. Young has already been found guilty and is serving two life sentences in jail but jurors were instructed not to consider that during Phillips' case.

Her turn: After two weeks of listening to the prosecution, Pamela Phillips' defense team will be given the chance to explain why they believe she is not guilty for arranging the pipe bomb that killed her ex husband

She has pled not guilty to the charges, but the prosecutors ended the first two weeks of the trial by playing recordings that Young secretly taped of their conversations.

'I wanted to tell you thank you because you're a great friend...The other thing is... is it looks like the money is gone,' she says in one tape.

Upset: On Thursday, the Arizona court heard recordings that Phillips' ex boyfriend Ron Young (pictured) made when he was calling her about payments for the bombing

'I'm not able to send you more money, I mean, there's, you know we need to talk about this.'

Even though Phillips and Triano, a real estate developer, were already divorced at the time of his death, she was still listed as the beneficiary of his life insurance policy so she was awarded $2million after the bombing.

By that time, Phillips had moved to Aspen and was indulging in expensive trips so the prosecution alleges that she was not able to keep up with her monthly payments to her reported hit man.

He became upset and began recording their phone conversations. In one recording that the court heard on Thursday, he tries to get her to admit her role but she brushes it off.

'You know what I'm just aggravated. Would you just leave me alone? Just leave me alone,' she is heard saying.

'Am I bothering you?' Young responds.

'Right now, you are. I've gotta go I've got kids down at the pool. I've got company at four-'

'Well you bothered me for some help so you could get rich, so,' he says.

'Will you leave me alone? Goodbye.'

At no point in the recordings does she confess to having a role in the bombing.

Her defense team revealed during the opening statements that they plan to show that she did not need to kill her husband because she had little to gain from the death of the father of her two children.

Prosecutors presented a wildly 
different theory of a woman who grew accustomed to the high life and 
found herself struggling financially with an easy way out.

Scene: The prosecution contends that while Phillips was not at the Tucson-area country club when her ex husband Gary Triano was killed in 1996, she paid Young to plant the bomb

'There
 is one reason that Gary Triano was murdered. One reason. He was 
murdered because his death benefited Pamela Phillips in a big way - 
$2million is a hell of a motive,' prosecutor Nicol Green said.

On Monday, the trial will turn to her defense team and they are expected to take up to a month- double the amount of time that the prosecution needed- to make their case.

Her attorneys have submitted a list of more than 100 possible witnesses who may be called to testify on her behalf.

One of those witnesses is Ed Kinnear, the diplomat father of actor Greg Kinnear.

Triano was a developer who made 
millions investing in Indian bingo halls and slot-machine parlors in 
Arizona and California before Congress authorized tribes to open 
full-blown casinos.

But after the real estate market declined and he lost control of his gambling interests, Triano went broke.

That's around the time Phillips filed for divorce, prosecutors say, because Triano could no longer support her expensive tastes.

Back in the day: The prosecution has painted Phillips, seen left in an undated photo, as a gold digger who left her real estate developer husband Gary Triano (right) after he lost much of his fortune

In court: Phillips was arrested in Austria in 2009 and extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was mentally unfit to stand trial at the time (pictured on February 19)

'All of a sudden, the lifestyle that this defendant insisted on and expected was no longer there,' Green said.

She
 eventually moved to Aspen and worked in real estate before meeting 
Young. The two would soon hatch a plan to kill Triano and collect on the
 policy, Green said.

'They were talking about it for years,' Green said.

Young later left Aspen while being investigated by police for fraud, and turned up in Tucson briefly in the summer of 1996.

'The reason he comes to Tucson was that he and Pamela Phillips had already agreed to kill Gary Triano,' Green said.

After
 the killing, Young was on the run from a warrant for his arrest in 
Colorado on fraud charges while Phillips was sending him money for the 
hit, eventually adding up to $400,000, Green told jurors.

The
 investigation into Triano's killing stalled until Young's arrest in 
2005. Authorities say he kept detailed records of his financial 
transactions with Phillips, including recorded telephone conversations 
and invoices.

Police also found divorce records pertaining to
 Phillips and Triano in a van rented by Young. That's when Young and 
Phillips became the key suspects.

She was arrested in Austria in 2009 and 
extradited to Tucson. Her case was delayed after a judge ruled she was 
mentally unfit to stand trial at the time.
