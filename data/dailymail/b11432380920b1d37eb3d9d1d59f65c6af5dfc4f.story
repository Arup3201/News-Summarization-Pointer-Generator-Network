Scientists have found a rare, 600-year-old Chinese coin on the Kenyan island of Manda that rewrites the history books on international trading.

Researchers say the copper coin, which has a square hole in the center so it could be worn on a belt, proves trade existed between China and eastern Africa decades before European explorers set sail.

Scientists say it was issued by Emperor Yongle of China who reigned from 1403-1425 during the Ming Dynasty, and his name is written on the coin.

The coin is made of copper and silver and has a square hole in the center so it could be worn on a belt. Scientists say it was issued by Emperor Yongle of China who reigned from 1403-1425 during the Ming Dynasty

The island of Manda, off the 
northern coast of Kenya (marked with a red dot, below), was home to an advanced civilization from about
200AD to 1430AD, when it was abandoned and never inhabited again.

Trade
played an important role in the development of Manda, and this coin may
show trade’s importance on the island dating back to much earlier than 
previously thought.

A joint expedition of scientists led by 
Chapurukha Kusimba of The Field Museum and Sloan Williams of the 
University of Illinois at Chicago found the  600-year-old Chinese coin 
on the Kenyan island of Manda.

Scientists from Kenya, Pennsylvania and Ohio also participated in the expedition. They also found human remains and other artifacts predating the coin.

Emperor Yongle, who started construction
of China’s Forbidden City, was interested in political and trade 
missions to the lands that ring the Indian Ocean and sent Admiral Zheng 
He, also known as Cheng Ho, to explore those shores.

'Zheng He was, in many ways, the 
Christopher Columbus of China,' said Dr. Kusimba, Curator of African 
Anthropology at The Field Museum.

'It’s wonderful to have a coin that may ultimately prove he came to Kenya,' he added.

'This finding is significant.

'We know
Africa has always been connected to the rest of the world, but this 
coin opens a discussion about the relationship between China and Indian 
Ocean nations.'

That
relationship stopped soon after Emperor Yongle’s death when later 
Chinese rulers banned foreign expeditions, allowing European explorers 
to dominate the Age of Discovery and expand their countries’ empires, 
the researchers say.

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to explore the region of current-day Kenya, Vasco da Gama having visited Mombasa in 1498.

The coast of East Africa was a valuable foothold in the eastern trade routes, and Mombasa was a key port for ivory.

Modern European exploration of Kenya wasn’t initiated until 1844 when two German missionaries, Johan Ludwig Krapf and Joahnnes Rebmann ventured into the interior from Mombasa in an attempt to introduce Christianity.

Manda in Kenya, now a popular holiday destination, was home to an advanced civilization from about 200AD to 1430AD, when it was abandoned and never inhabited again
