Apple changed the way they paid their CEO Tim Cook this year, and he lost $4 million by his own choice.

The board at Apple decided to pay the CEO based on the company's performance. They decided that if the company's stocks in the S&P stock index did better than other stocks, than Cook could take home more money.

If the stock performed less, than Cook would take on the financial burden and take home less yearly income.

Apple CEO Tim Cook chose to give up $4 million to set a strong 'leadership example' for the company

CNN reports that Apple's Proxy Report filed on Sunday implicated Cook would be taking a significant pay cut.

Initially Apple didn't want Cook to give up half his stock grants. Instead they only wanted to take a sum less than half. Cook decided to risk more in order to help the company.

In the proxy filing Apple said Cook had a, 'strong desire to set a leadership example in the area of CEO compensation and governance.'

The 50 per cent Cook forked over added up to $4 million dollars. While the amount may sound high, Cook is not filing for  bankruptcy any time soon.

CNN reports that the $4 million less he made this year represents only 10 per cent of what the CEO made last year.

A year ago he got $36.4 million in stock grants, $1.4 million in salary, and a $2.8 million cash bonus.

The reason Cook lost money this year is because Apple stock performed terribly in August. It fell 26 per cent between 2012 and 2013--therefore Cook lost all the 50 per cent of stock share he put at steak.

Those holding Apple shares shouldn't be too alarmed, however. Lately, Apple Stock has been surpassing the S&P 500 since August and will most likely keep all 40,000 shares worth  $22.4 million in August of 2014. 

Cook took over Apple in 2011 following CEO and founder Steve Job's untimely death and has done his best to fill Jobs' shoes.
