According to the Sun, the new Red Devils boss is keen for the Desso Grass-Master system to be installed ready for when he takes charge after managing Holland in this summer's World Cup finals.

However, the high-tech surface is already used by the club for the Old Trafford pitch and has also been installed on a number of rival Premier League pitches.

Ordinary turf is reinforced by the artificial fibers which makes it much harder wearing.

The 62-year-old, who has previously managed Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Ajax, also want floodlights installed for afternoon winter training which will set the club back almost Â£4million.

Meanwhile, Van Gaal and his Holland squad arrived in Brazil on Friday morning ahead of their World Cup opener against champions Spain next week.

Oranje will also play Australia and Chile in Group B.
