It's usually invisible to the naked eye, but Nasa’s latest ultra-high-resolution computer model shows plumes of carbon dioxide swirling and shifting across the globe.

The visualisation provides a fascinating look at how gases in the atmosphere build up, and travel over the course of a year.

In the video, a year of data is compressed into just over three minutes, revealing concentrations dipping during the spring, and peaking when winter hits.

The visualisation (pictured) was created by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. It shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres. Colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide, from dark blue to pink

It was produced by a model called GEOS-5, created by scientists at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre’s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office.

The simulation also shows the differences between carbon dioxide levels in the northern and southern hemispheres, plus distinct swings in global carbon dioxide concentrations as plants and trees grow and change with the seasons.

The visualisation was created using a simulation called a Nature Run.

The Nature Run uses data on atmospheric conditions and the emission of greenhouse gases, from both natural and man-made sources.

They may only be tiny, and live for just three months, but ants could be the key to solving climate change.

Rough harvester ants have been found to ‘weather’ minerals in sand to produce calcium carbonate, also known as limestone.

When the ants make this limestone, the process traps carbon dioxide in the rock, ultimately removing it from the atmosphere.

It is unsure how the minerals are converted, however, and theories range from ants licking the sand, to excreting the substance.

The discovery was made by Professor Ronald Dorn from the University of Arizona Tempe. 

The model is then left to run on its own and simulate the natural behaviour of the Earth’s atmosphere.

This particular Nature Run simulates January 2006 to December 2006.

Goddard scientists have been working with a beta version of the Nature Run for several years, but recently released an updated, improved version for the first time.

The colours represent the concentration of carbon dioxide, from dark blue to pink - ranging from 377 to 395 parts per million.

Red represents around 385 parts per million, and plumes shown on the greyscale are carbon monoxide emissions.

The video is narrated by Nasa climate scientists Bill Putman.

‘Carbon dioxide is the most important greenhouse gas affected by human activity,’ explained Mr Putman.

‘About half of the carbon dioxide emitted by fuel combustion remains in the atmosphere, while the other half is absorbed by natural land and ocean reservoirs.

‘In the northern hemisphere, we see the highest concentrations are focused around emission sources over Northern America, Europe and Asia.

In the northern hemisphere, the highest concentrations of gas are focused around emission sources over Northern America, Europe and Asia. During spring and summer, plants absorb carbon dioxide. This removes some of the gas, and the model changes from red and purple to green and yellow (pictured)

‘Notice how the gas doesn’t stay in one place, the dispersion of carbon dioxide is controlled by the large-scale weather patterns within the global circulation.’

During spring and summer in the northern hemisphere, plants absorb a substantial amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis.

This removes some of the gas from the atmosphere, and the model is seen changing from red and purple to green, yellow and blue.

During this time, carbon monoxide (pictured in grey) is released in the southern hemisphere, and during the summer, plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in Africa and Australia. These emissions are moved around the globe by the wind. As plants die during autumn, carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again

Meanwhile,carbon monoxide is seen being released in the southern hemisphere, and during the summer, plumes of the harmful gas are released from fires in Africa and Australia.

These emissions are then moved around the globe by the wind.

As plants die during autumn and winter, carbon dioxide levels begin to rise again.

‘Although this change is expected, we’re seeing higher levels of carbon dioxide accumulate in the atmosphere each year.

‘This is contributing to the long-term trend of rising global temperatures,’ concluded Mr Putman.
