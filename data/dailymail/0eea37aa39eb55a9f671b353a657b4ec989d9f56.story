The family of an alleged Facebook fraudster who faces up to 40 years in prison have gone missing days after he went on the run, police say.

Paul Ceglia, 41, of Wellsville, New York, sued the social media founder, Mark Zuckerberg, in 2010, claiming he had been promised a 50 per cent share in the business in exchange for start-up money.

But federal prosecutors said he fabricated and destroyed evidence to falsely support his case and he was due to go on trial on May 4.

However, this week it was reported that, while under house arrest, he ditched his ankle monitoring bracelet and assumed fugitive status ahead of the hearing.

Now authorities say family members are concerned over the whereabouts of his wife, 36-year-old Iasia M. Ceglia, 36, and their two young sons, Leeman, ten, and Joseffinn, 11 (children seen here)

Now authorities are concerned over the whereabouts of his wife, 36-year-old Iasia M. Ceglia, and their two young sons, Leeman, 10, and Joseffinn, 11.

The family and their dog apparently have not been seen at home since March 10.

Two childhood friends of Mrs Ceglia told WGRZ News that they believe it's possible her husband coerced her to flee with him.

Neither had been able to contact her by telephone, which they said was 'unusual'.

Police are currently appealing for anyone for information on the Ceglia family's location to come forward.

Ceglia faces  trial on a charge he fraudulently claimed ownership in Facebook. His civil lawsuit against founder Zuckerberg was thrown out after he was accused of doctoring a software development contract he signed with Zuckerberg in 2003.

Authorities say he made it appear Zuckerberg promised him half ownership in return for $1,000 in start-up money.

Ceglia was criminally charged in 2012 and went on to plead not guilty to fraud charges. He was due to go on trial in May.

However, it emerged this week that Ceglia had one missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet.

'I don’t know where he is,' his attorney, Robert Fogg, admitted. 'I haven’t got a clue.'

Speaking to Reuters, Fogg said Ceglia's tracking device had been found at his home, in New York's rural Allegany County, after the U.S. Marshals Service was dispatched to check on him on Sunday.

He said he has not heard from Ceglia, adding that U.S. District Judge Vernon Broderick has now scheduled a court hearing for Tuesday that was 'most definitely spawned by the recent event'.

Last April, Buffalo federal judge Richard Arcara officially closed the book on Mr Ceglia's multibillion-dollar lawsuit claiming half-ownership of Facebook, granting Mr Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss it

The ruling affirmed a magistrate judge's recommendation from a year earlier, saying the suit should be thrown out because the 2003 software development contract Ceglia had based it on was faked.

Ceglia had claimed that he and Zuckerberg had signed a contract, 'The Face Book', that included a provision entitling him to half-ownership of Facebook in exchange for start-up money for the firm.

At the time, Zuckerberg was a freshman at Harvard University. 

Although Facebook's lawyers agreed the pair had a contract, they said references to the social network were slipped in for the lawsuit.

Claims: Ceglia - who claimed he had been promised a 50 per cent share in Facebook (pictured) - was due to go on trial on May 4. However, he is now missing from his home after somehow removing his ankle bracelet

Zuckerberg had previously done some programming work for Ceglia's company, StreetFax.com. 

The lawyers argued that  the only valid contract between the pair related to that company.

At the time of Ceglia's arrest, Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said the suspect - who also provided allegedly falsified emails - was seeking a 'quick payday based on a blatant forgery.'

'The contract is a cut-and-paste job, the emails are complete fabrications and this entire lawsuit is a fraud,' attorneys for Mr Zuckerberg and his Palo Alto, California-based company added.

'Zuckerberg has now declared under oath that he did not sign the contract attached to Ceglia's complaint and that he did not write or receive any of the purported emails.'

On Monday, Fogg said that Ceglia - who has pleaded not guilty - has 'always been concerned with justice'.

 'He has always been concerned about if he'd get a fair trial,' the attorney added.

Ceglia has twice tried to get the charges dropped. He is also appealing against the 2014 ruling. 

November 22, 2003 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia

'I have recently met with a couple of upperclassmen here at Harvard that are planning to launch a site very similar to ours. If we don’t make a move soon, I think we will lose the advantage we would have if we release before them.

'I’ve stalled them for the time being and with a break if you could send another $1000 for the facebook (sic) project it would allow me to pay my roommate or Jeff to help integrate the search code and get the site live before them. Please give me a call so that we can talk more about this.'

January 1, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia

'I think it is unnecessary at this point, with all of the extra work I have done for you, to be held to the original completion date. I should not be penalized for delays that were out of my control, namely that there have been so many unspecified requests from the Streetfax project that you wanted to be placed as a priority, thereby delaying my start on our second project.

'Thus, I am requesting a written waiver on your part exempting me from the obligation to give you additional ownership in the project that is outlined in our original contract.'

January 5 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg

'It is well past January 1 and to my knowledge you don't have a single thing done for the site... You know perfectly well that you can't just take a person's investment and then spend it on women and beer or whatever you do up there in Harvard.

'I've been stalled long enough on this thing and if I don't see something soon I'll no choice but to contact the school and perhaps your parents in Dobbs Ferry and let them know what's going on.'

February 2, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia

'Paul, I have a rather serious issue to discuss with you, according to our contract I owe you over 30% more of the business in late penalties which would give you over 80% of the company.

'First I want to say that I think that is completely unfair because I did so much extra work for you on your site that caused those delays in the first place and second I don’t even think it is legal to charge such a huge penalty.

'Mostly though I just won’t even bother putting the site live if you are going to insist on such a large percentage. I’d like to suggest that you drop the penalty completely and that we officially return to 50/50 ownership.'

February 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia

'Sorry it’s taken me a few days to respond, (sic) Now that the sites (sic) live I feel I must take creative control and I just can not risk injuring my sites (sic) reputation by cheapening it with your idea of selling college junk, nor do I wish to spend my time shipping out coffee mugs to rich alumni. The site is cool as it is and I don’t care about making any money on it right now, I just want to see if people will use it.'

February 7, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg

'Mark, all I can think is your parents have handed you everything your entire life and after all this time and energy and MONEY that you think in your head that an ok way to act is to just say - oh I’ve changed my mind I don’t think it’s cool to make money and that that should be that.'

April 6, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia

'Paul, I have become too busy to deal with the site and no one wants to pay for it, so I am thinking of just taking the server down. My parents have a fund that I can tap into for my college expenses and I would just like to give you your two thousand dollars back and call it even on the rest of the money you owe me for the extra work. At this point I won’t even really be able to work on the facebook until Summer.'

April 6, 2004 - Mr Ceglia to Mr Zuckerberg

'Grow up, take a f***ing ethics class, choke yourself with that silver spoon of yours.'

July 22, 2004 - Mr Zuckerberg to Mr Ceglia (A week before Facebook was incorporated)

'Paul, I am guessing that you don’t want to talk to me but I wanted to say happy birthday and that I hope to resolve our differences. I see that what I did was wrong and I am really sorry that I behaved as I did. Please give me your address and I will mail you back the $2000 for your trouble, more if it will repair our business relationship.

'Another summer is here and I still don’t have any time to build our site, I understand that I promised I would, but other things have come up and I am out in California working during break. I just don’t want the obligation of having to answer to you for not following through and I won’t be able to. Best, Mark'
