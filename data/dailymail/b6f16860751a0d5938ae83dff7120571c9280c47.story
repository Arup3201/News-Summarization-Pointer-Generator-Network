A single mom in Utah proved that one man's trash really is another man's treasure.

Brooke Stewart from Salt Lake City was dumpster diving for scrap metal when she discovered envelopes with two seven-year-old diamonds worth $8,000.

The mother-of-one, who was shocked at what she found, said she could have used the money, but chose  to track down the owner to return them.

Stewart usually spends time collecting recyclable metal like copper from dumpsters to help pay her bills, but this time she was going through a dumpster in Millcreek  when she found white envelopes.

The first one was empty, but she later found two more envelopes where there was a diamond in each that were nearly one carat, according to KUTV.

As she was shocked at the discovery, she immediately called her mom and friend to tell them she had just found diamonds.

'I really am broke and would have enjoyed that much money,' said Stewart.

The two diamonds were worth between $4,000 and $8,000 according to an appraiser

The envelopes contained the name of an appraiser who Stewart contacted to find out if the diamonds were real.

Lynn Van Wagenen researched the diamonds and realized they were seven years old and worth up to $8,000.

He said that Stewart could have thrown away the appraisals and taken the diamonds to a pawn shop where she would have collected between $4,000 and $8,000.

Van Wagenen reached out to the shocked owner who believes the diamonds and some of his other items were stolen seven years ago. The owner has not been identified.

He found the discovery and good deed by Stewart 'remarkable'.

The owner met with her at the same dumpster where she found his diamonds, and she returned them, as the pair shook hands and he thanked her.

Stewart was given a cash reward for her kindness. 

Stewart, who frequently dumpster dives for scrap metal, said she is 'broke' and would have 'enjoyed' the money if she had kept the diamonds but instead chose to do a good deed (above she wrote on Facebook that she dumpster dives to make money)
