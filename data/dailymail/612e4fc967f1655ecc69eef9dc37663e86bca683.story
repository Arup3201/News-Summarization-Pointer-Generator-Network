Sunderland are targeting a move for Jack Rodwell as the Manchester City midfielder goes in search of first team football.

The 23-year-old has spent two seasons at the club, but he's failed to make much of an impact under two managers at the Etihad, making just 26 appearances in all competitions and scoring twice in the process.

Rodwell was bought from Everton by Roberto Mancini for an initial fee of £12million in 2012, but was held back by a series of injuries and managed just 11 Premier League appearances.

And his fortunes did not improve at all last season, with Manuel Pellegrini giving him just 10 games in all competitions.

Rodwell also has three caps for England, but only one of them has come whilst he has been in Manchester - a substitute cameo during a 2-2 draw against Brazil at the Maracana last June.

He is now being chased by Sunderland, who are attempting to add to their squad following their dramatic Premier League survival last season.
