Rory McIlroy took to the streets of Liverpool on Sunday night to celebrate his Open victory.

The 25-year-old won the Claret Jug at Hoylake in the afternoon, before being seen out a few hours later with his mum and fellow professional Justin Rose as they headed to The Empire Club in Liverpool.

And it also appeared as though he was with Irish model Nadia Forde, who he is rumoured to be dating just eight weeks after breaking off his engagement with tennis star Caroline Wozniacki.

McIlroy secured his first ever Open win after leading from the first round on Thursday to win by two shots.

He adds the success to his 2011 US Open victory, and 2012 USPGA triumph, to become only the third man after Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods in history to win three of the four majors by the age of 25.

He is also the first European golfer to win three different majors and now needs to secure a Masters title for a Career Grand Slam.
