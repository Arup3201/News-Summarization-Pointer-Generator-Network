Dr Richard Holmes, who committed suicide after quitting his job at the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory in Porton Down

A weapons expert who worked with Dr David Kelly at the Government’s secret chemical warfare laboratory took his own life after leaving his job while under investigation for bullying, an inquest heard today.

Dr Richard Holmes, a married father of one, resigned from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL) in Porton Down, Wiltshire the day before he was due to face a disciplinary hearing for gross misconduct in February last year.

Dr Holmes had been suspended from his role at the laboratory in November 2011 after a contractor he was working with on the Typhoon-Joint Strike Fighter project complained about bullying.

On leaving his position Dr Holmes planned to take his former employer to an employment tribunal, and started to explore opportunities with US-based firms.

But the inquest heard that on the day he disappeared, he had also found out that an application for a job as a cleaner at Salisbury District Hospital had been unsuccessful.

In the 1990s Dr Homes worked with Dr David Kelly, the government scientist who killed himself in 2003 after being named as a source of controversial claims about the government's 'dodgy dossier' on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.

Dr Holmes' body was discovered by 
police on April 13 last year in a field in the village of Laverstock, 
close to his Salisbury home, two days after he had last been seen by his
wife and teenage daughter.

His
wife has reported him missing on April 12 and a missing person inquiry 
was launched. An examination of a computer found that Dr Holmes had 
researched methods of suicide in the days before he died.

A post mortem examination was carried out on Dr Holmes' body, and found that he had taken a poison, the court heard how he had been prescribed anti-depressants by a GP after being diagnosed with moderate to severe depression.

A handwritten note was also found in his pocket the inquest was told.

Police said that they were satisfied that no one else was involved in the scientist's death, and that it was not suspicious.

Although
it is not clear if Dr Holmes and Dr Kelly were close, one source told The 
Mail on Sunday that they were friendly when they worked at Porton Down 
in the Nineties.

At the 
time, Dr Holmes ran a project organising the installation of chemical 
protection equipment in RAF Sentinel spy planes, while Dr Kelly was head
of microbiology and frequently toured the former Soviet Union as a 
weapons inspector.

Dr Kelly's suicide in 2003 followed his naming as the source of the journalist Andrew Gilligan's BBC report about the government's 'dodgy dossier' on Iraqi WMD, which claimed that the government knew its claim that Iraq could attack British targets within 45 minutes was not substantiated. His death triggered the Hutton inquiry.

The inquest into Dr Holmes' death also heard from his widow, Susan Holmes, who also works at DSTL.

She told how her husband was very committed to his job, working 50 to 60 hour weeks and expected the same from colleagues.

She
said: 'He lived and breathed his work. In some ways he always had 
difficulties at work because if you were not as committed in delivering 
the work, or had it in the forefront of your mind he didn't really have a
lot of time for you.'

'He gave 110 percent and expected everyone else to. He felt strongly that as public servants spending tax payers' money you should make sure you were getting the best value for tax payers' money.

'Richard had quite strong views about the role of contractors and felt they were more committed to the company they worked for than the public purse.'

She also told how her husband was shocked to be suspended and did not understand what he had done wrong.

Although it is not clear if Dr Holmes and Dr Kelly were close, one source told The Mail on Sunday that they were friendly when they worked at Porton Down in the Nineties.

At the time, Dr Holmes ran a project organising the installation of chemical protection equipment in RAF Sentinel spy planes, while Dr Kelly was head of microbiology and frequently toured the former Soviet Union as a weapons inspector.

After the first Gulf War, Dr Holmes is also thought to have worked on the production of chemical protection suits for troops.

In 1991 he was the joint author of a scientific paper about an RAF chemical and biological protection system.

Mrs Holmes added: ' When he received the letter of complaint he was shocked because he thought they had quite a good relationship.'

During the hearing Mrs Holmes  was asked whether her husband's character could be that of someone diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum, and admitted that her husband was single-minded and did not always pick up on how other people would be feeling.

She also told how her husband had difficulty sleeping, but this had got worse following his suspension.

Although he hoped to eventually take up work with one of the American contractors that DSTL dealt with, Mrs Holmes spoke of how her husband applied for a cleaning job to 'get out of the house'.

She said: 'He had an email saying he had been unsuccessful, which I warned him he would because he was dramatically overqualified.

'He was cross. He said a couple of times' don't worry, I'm not going to do anything silly.'"

On the day that Dr Holmes disappeared the inquest heard how he went up to see his daughter Laura, who was in bed.

He told her not to leave the house because he was going for a walk and not taking his keys with him.

'He kissed her teddy bear, which was not very normal, but in retrospect he was saying goodbye,' Mrs Holmes said.

She added: 'He was just broken-hearted about not being part of the MoD - it had been so much a part of his life.'

The inquest also heard from Nick Stokes, a trade union representative who had been supporting Dr Holmes through the disciplinary process.

Mr Stokes agreed with a question from the coroner about improving measures to deal with employees at the laboratory who may be showing signs of autism.

Wiltshire and Swindon Coroner David Ridley recorded a conclusion that: 'Dr Holmes took his own life while suffering from depression.'

He also said that he would be writing a letter to the Ministry of Defence expressing his concerns about the welfare procedures in place to deal with an employee who may be displaying signs of autism.
