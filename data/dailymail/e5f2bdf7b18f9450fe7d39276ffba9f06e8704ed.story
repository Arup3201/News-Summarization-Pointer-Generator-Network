The murder trial into the killing of a Russian tycoon once dubbed Princess Michael of Kent's 'toyboy' is rapidly descending into farce after key evidence has gone missing, and witnesses have refused to testify because of 'threats', it emerged today.

Furniture magnate Mikhail Kravchenko, 46, was shot dead driving his Mercedes near Moscow in 2012, but the truth behind his death appears no closer to being revealed.

There are even claims that the suspected killer has 'escaped'.

The suave businessman caused a royal scandal six years earlier when he was photographed walking hand in hand with the princess - who will be 70 next month - in Venice during a four day holiday during which they allegedly enjoyed a gondola trip and shared a suite in Venice's Cipriani Hotel.

Police arrested three suspects - including a former business partner of Kravchenko who had alleged gangland ties - in the aftermath of the killing.

But now - following a dozen court sessions - a major Kremlin-friendly newspaper, Moskovsky Komsomolets, has concluded bluntly: 'We should not expect a fair trial.'

There are even fears the case could be aborted.

A source in the Investigative Committee, equivalent of the FBI, said: 'Witnesses are receiving letters with threats. They are hiding and do not want to speak in court.'

One was approached in the street and told not to testify or 'things will get much worse'.

State investigators 'have lost important physical evidence on the case', according to court sources, including an unspecified item 'even more important for establishing guilt than the actual weapon'.

The newspaper stated: 'It became known that the evidence was missing about three weeks ago. But so far it does not affect the trial because the judge has not started studying the evidence yet.'

Framed? Pronin, a former security aide to Kravchenko is an alleged member of the 'Elephants' mafia ring. Kravchenko's friends have expressed doubts that he ordered the shooting, suggesting he was set up

The trial is going ahead regardless despite the absence of the suspected killer. Named as Sergei Filippov, he 'managed to escape from police and investigators after the crime', according to Interfax news agency.

On trial are Alexei Pronin, a former security aide to Kravchenko who is an alleged member of the 'Elephants' mafia ring, and two associates Mikhail Ischenko and Vitaliy Antishin, who both work for a small Moscow security agency.

Royal scandal: Kravchenko was photographed walking hand-in-hand with the princess. She said they were just good friends and that she was a 'tactile person, I do it all the time'

People from Kravchenko's circle have expressed doubts that Pronin ordered the shooting, suggesting he was framed. Pronin denies any part in his murder.

The princess maintained that she and Kravchenko were just good friends, famously adding when asked why they were holding hands: 'I'm a very tactile person, I do it all the time.'

Yet there were also claims that she was 'mesmerised' by Kravchenko, while a loyal aide to the Russian tycoon, Marina Sherstyuk, said: 'Mikhail had charisma of such magnitude that no woman, or indeed man, could stay indifferent to him.'

Sherstyuk had no idea whether their relationship became physical. 'How can you be 100 per cent sure?'

Yet in the aftermath of the Venice scandal, the princess, this time with her husband Prince Michael, went on a Volga River boat trip with Kravchenko.

After his death, a spokesman said Prince Michael and his wife were 'very distressed to hear of this tragedy'.

Theories abounded as to why Kravchenko was murdered. 

There was even speculation from conspiracy theorists that it could have been a state-instigated assassination to strike at the British Establishment, linked to the close friendship between Prince Michael and his financial backer, exiled businessman Boris Berezovsky, who died in mysterious circumstances in Berkshire less than a year later.

Berezovsky was seen as Vladimir Putin's sworn enemy.

Some people close to Kravchenko fear he was killed in a bid by major business interests to grab control of his 'March 8' furniture empire.

Another theory was that the murder could have been a case of mistaken identity.

The official version is that he was killed over a small-scale property ownership dispute in Ryazan region but one source who knew Kravchenko well claimed this was 'contrived and implausible'.

The blunders over the trial show 'someone is trying to muddy the waters and stop the truth getting out'.
