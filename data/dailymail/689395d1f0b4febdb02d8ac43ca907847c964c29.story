An erotic novelist has told of the moment she visited a church to research her next book ... only to discover a bundle of blue Ikea bags brimming with human bones.

Kicki Karlén popped down to her local chapel in Kläckeberga, southern Sweden, to find inspiration for an original plot-line, when she was confronted with one she could scarcely have made up.

And the author - whose last book was 'Eroticism under the Full Moon' - was so inspired by the macabre mystery that she now plans to use it in her next story.

Grim find: The bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access

'I was thinking the book could be set in the Viking ages... the Viking history is strong in this part of the country - a perfect setting for some kind of love triangle,' she told The Local.

But that's when she came across the collection of shopping bags containing dozens of remains that appeared long forgotten and left to gather dust.

'There were around 80 skeletons,' she added. 'And it made me very angry about how they were just sitting there. Some people at the parish told me the bones had been there since 2009.'

She went on: 'It's not fair that people are just left behind like that, so disrespectfully. For me, it doesn't matter whether you're alive or dead, a life is a precious and meaningful thing. Too many people forget that nowadays.'

The bags were covered by a tarpaulin sheet and have been sitting there since parts of the church were dug up and rebuilt to allow wheelchair access.

Archaeologist Ludvig Papmehl-Dufay, who was part of the team which conducted the dig, told The Local that the bones may have been up to 500 years old.

'Our mission was to document and rebury the bones,' he said. 'But the reburial was delayed and I have no idea why. The plan was to rebury them as soon as possible, but that's up to the church. The county board said they couldn't leave church ground, and it became complicated.'

While Papmehl-Dufay denied putting the bones in the Ikea bags himself, he admitted that it sounded like an efficient storage technique.

'It's not standard practice, definitely not for archaeologists, but the Ikea bags aren't actually that bad,' he added. 'They'd be great for stopping the moulding process. But it can't be that good to have them in the basement for so long.'

Meanwhile, Ms Karlén says the bones could prove useful in her next erotic novel. 

'You know, I just might put them in,' she said. 'I have to say I'm tempted.'
