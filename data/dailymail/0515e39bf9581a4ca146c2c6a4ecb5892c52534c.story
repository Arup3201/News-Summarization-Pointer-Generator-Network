He limped into the dock with a large bandage on his right hand.

Amid tight security, Michael Adebowale appeared in court yesterday accused of the murder of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich last week.

With his wrists cuffed in front of him, the 22-year-old sat between two plain-clothes police officers behind a bullet-proof screen as he was accused of killing the soldier in broad daylight on a London street. Outside, up to 40 officers patrolled the streets.

Wearing a grey long-sleeved 
sweatshirt and baggy white trousers, Adebowale stared blankly from the 
dock throughout most of the short hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ 
Court.

The former Greenwich University 
student, who was also charged with possession of a revolver with intent 
to cause others to believe that violence would be used, spoke in mumbled
 tones to confirm his name and date of birth.

At one point he nodded 
when Chief Magistrate Howard Riddle told him: ‘There’s no need to stand,
 Mr Adebowale. I understand you have been injured.’

The defendant is believed to have lost several fingers during the incident in Woolwich last week. He was also shot by police.

Bethan David, a specialist prosecutor
 with the Crown Prosecution Service counter-terrorism division, said 
Adebowale will appear before the Old Bailey on June 28 when he may enter
 a plea to the two charges.

Another hearing to bring the case 
under the terrorism protocol, which governs how terrorism prosecutions 
are heard in court, is due to take place on Monday, she added.

At the 
end of the 18-minute hearing, he walked out through the jailer’s door. 
He appeared to be holding up his white cotton trousers with his cuffed 
hands.

Adebowale was released from hospital 
on Tuesday night and questioned by detectives for more than 24 hours 
before he was charged late on Wednesday night.

He was represented by Abbas Lakha, 
QC, who has acted for defendants in at least five UK terror trials over 
the past 12 years, including a case involving a plot to spread the 
deadly poison ricin on the streets of Britain.

Michael Adebolajo, the second suspect in the Woolwich case, remains in hospital and is too ill to be questioned.

A post-mortem examination has  
confirmed that Drummer Rigby, a  25-year-old father of one, died of 
multiple stab wounds. An inquest into his death will open at Southwark 
Coroner’s Court tomorrow.
