Lille's Europa League game with Everton on Thursday night proved to be rather uneventful as the Blues secured a well-earned 0-0 draw in France to keep them top of Group H ahead of Wolfsburg.

However, unfortunately scenes off the pitch marred the Toffees' trip, with trouble first erupting on Wednesday in Lille's main square as up to 100 hooded hooligans attacked visiting supporters, before there was more unprovoked violence on Thursday.

Here Sportsmail's Ashley Clements talks you through his version of events as the shocking violence erupted near him in the main square. 

I was standing to the side of Lille’s main square with Everton fans. We were enjoying each other’s company and a football was being kicked around the centre.

The first sign of trouble came when several bottles started to be thrown and a blue flare was released by the visiting fans.

People started to realise something was happening towards a corner of the square and a group of fans started to run towards where the trouble seemed to be brewing.

A large bang echoed through the area before riot police, shields raised, marched towards the area of chaos. One Everton fan, seemingly minding his own business, was knocked to the ground as the police marched through. Fans began to run away from the area (left), some sneezing and rubbing their eyes.

One fan shouted that the police were using rubber bullets.

Standing slightly behind the riot police, I then saw a number of bottles being thrown their way as they retreated before the area calmed.

'The club has been made aware of an isolated incident in a bar in Lille on Wednesday evening in which a number of Evertonians were attacked by a group of around 50 local men.

'The club understands that two Everton fans suffered minor facial injuries and were taken to the local hospital, and that this was the only incident in what was otherwise a good-natured evening in the city centre.

'The club are in continual contact with Merseyside police officers, who are in Lille today (Thursday), and the city's police representatives. Supporters travelling to tonight's match are advised to utilise the travel information provided on the official website where updates on any safety matters will also be provided.'
