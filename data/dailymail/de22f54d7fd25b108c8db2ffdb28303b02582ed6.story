Mia Love has made history in Utah after becoming the first black Republican woman to be elected to United States Congress.

The former Mayor of Saratoga Springs defeated her Democratic opponent Doug Owens in the race to represent Utah's 4th congressional district late last night.

During her victory speech, Love said 'there is great cause for confidence' as she runs with Utahns towards the 'challenges of our time'.

Owens tweeted at 11:25 p.m. that he had called Love to concede the race.

His campaign manager told Fox 13 News  that Love won the race  by a margin of 50 per cent to 46 per cent.

'Thank you for the trust you have placed in me,' Love said in a statement. 'I will work every day to be deserving of it. 

'Regardless of who you voted for today, I hope you know that I am going to Washington to represent everyone in the district and invite you to engage with me in finding real solutions to the challenges we face as a country.'

The Republican also pledged to 'work every day to keep the federal government out of your lives, out of your pockets, and out of your way so you can run toward your own American Dream'.

Democrat Doug Owens said he felt 'at peace' with the result and was proud of his staff's efforts, but added that he felt in the end low voter turn out might have made the difference

She said: 'Many people have reminded me that tonight is not the end of the race; it is just the end of the beginning,' 

'As your representative, I am not going to ask you to trust Washington - I am going to convince Washington to trust you.

'As Utahns, we know best how to spend our hard earned money, raise our families, educate our children, keep the promises made to our seniors, and help those in need.'

Love, a Haitian-American, failed in her first attempt to win a congressional seat in 2012, losing to a Democratic incumbent by just 768 votes out of more than 245 cast.

Owens told KUER that he felt 'at peace' with the result and was proud of his staff's efforts, but added that he felt in the end  low voter turn out might have made the difference.

'I had a good feeling going in and obviously I would rather the outcome have been different, but I feel at peace about it. I feel good about it. We'll be back. We're not done yet,' he said

Love was riding a wave of GOP victory that saw Republicans consolidate their power on Capitol Hill, picking up more seats than they needed to gain control of the US Senate.

Their triumphs included key wins in Arkansas, West Virginia, Montana, South Dakota, Colorado, North Carolina and Iowa, all seats controlled by Democrats when the day began. 

'The American people have put their trust in the Republican Party, sending a GOP majority to the U.S. Senate,' said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus.

'Our party's principles and message resonated with voters across the country. This was a rejection of President Obama's failed polices and Harry Reid's dysfunctional Senate.'

'Republicans have been given the opportunity to lead the country in a better direction, and the Republican House and Senate are ready to listen to the American people. We hope President Obama will too.'

Love said 'there is great cause for confidence' as she runs with Utahns towards the 'challenges of our time'

Democrat candidate Doug Owens tweeted at 11:25 p.m. that he had called Love to concede the race

'It's time to get to work on creating jobs, expanding American energy development, pursuing real healthcare reform, reducing spending, reining in the federal government, and keeping America safe.' 

Love told her supporters that she was proud to be a part of a surge of Republican support, KUER reported. 

'This election is historic because it has raised Utah's voice and we have boldly told congress that the status quo will not work. Above all, this election is about remembering our history, reclaiming our freedom and reshaping our future,' she said.
