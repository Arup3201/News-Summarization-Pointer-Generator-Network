They battled their way into the Top Ten after wowing an Army of fans on The X Factor last year.

Now boyband Union J have joined the fight to raise £80million a year to support military personnel and their families.

The four-piece - known for their boyish looks and ability to drive girls crazy during their stint on the TV talent show - have starred in a video for the Royal British Legion which is taking the internet by storm.

Starring role: Members of the boyband Union J have appeared in a video for the Royal British Legion to help launch Poppy Picnics, which is the charity's newest summer fundraising initiative

They appeared in the comedy clip alongside Royal Marines and Royal Navy commandos to launch 'Poppy Picnics', the charity's newest summer fundraising initiative.

Dressed in full military combat kit, the 'Carry You' sensations fast roped from a Royal Navy helicopter before hitting the ground and rushing into action.

Having descended from the chopper, the Union J boys then race to their 'target' - and gatecrash a picnic.

The tongue-in-cheek video has proved a massive hit on YouTube and the band have added to their Forces supporter credentials by confirming they will perform at a special concert for troops later in the year. 

The group - George Shelley, 19, Josh Cuthbert, 21, Jaymi Hensley, 23, and JJ Hamblett, 25 - won new fans by giving up a full day of their hectic touring schedule to film the video at RAF Northolt in north-west London.

The band caused a stir at the airbase by walking into military premises dressed in full combat gear - but still sporting trademark designer hairstyles.

'Are those earrings regulation uniform?', one quizzical officer asked as the boyband sprinted past.

While the video was fun there was a serious part for the band, who reached number three in the charts with their debut single: Both George and Josh have relatives serving in the military.

George - the group's youngest member - said: 'My brother is currently in the Royal Marines so this is a cause especially close to my heart.

'It was incredible hearing some of their stories. They work they do is amazing.'

'The Royal British Legion are there for the entire Armed Forces community, both serving and veterans.

'We had a great day shooting the video and a really fun Poppy Picnic with some of the families stationed at RAF Northolt.

'It was incredible hearing some of their stories. They work they do is amazing.'

Charles Byrne, the Royal British Legion's fundraising director, said: 'Union J are fantastic supporters.

'The guys really get what the Legion does and value the work we do in supporting the Armed Forces and their families.

'Hosting a Poppy Picnic is a fun and simple way to get together with friends and family and help raise the much-needed money required so we can deliver vitally important welfare work.'
