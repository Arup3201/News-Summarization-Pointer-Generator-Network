Astronauts on the International Space Station have discovered that it has a leak of ammonia coolant in its power system.

The outpost's commander has described the situation as serious, but not life-threatening and the problem is being investigated, officials said.

On Thursday the six-member crew noticed white flakes of ammonia leaking out of the station.

Chilled liquid ammonia runs through multiple radiator loops to cool the station's power system on its eight giant solar array panels.

NASA said the leak is increasing from one previously leaking loop that can be bypassed if needed. 

A minor leak of this ammonia was first noticed in 2007, and NASA has been studying the issue ever since.

In November 2012 two astronauts took a spacewalk to fix the problem, rewiring some coolant lines and installing a spare radiator due to fears the original radiator was damaged by a micrometeorite impact.

Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada has tweeted that the problem, while serious, has been stabilized

‘It is in the same area, but we don't know whether it's the same leak,’ NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries of the Johnson Space Center in Houston told Space.com.

NASA spokesman Bob Jacobs said engineers are working on rerouting electronics just in case the loop shuts down. The Earth-orbiting station has backup systems.

Space station Commander Chris Hadfield of Canada tweeted that the problem, while serious, was stabilized. Officials will know more Friday.

The space station always has enough emergency escape ships for the crew, but there are no plans to use them.
