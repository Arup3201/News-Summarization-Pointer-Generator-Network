The gunslingers are long gone and tumbleweeds have taken over at this abandoned American Wild West theme park, which hasn't seen a cowboy, not even one in fancy dress, for years.

The saloon bar doors last swung open in 2009, since when the Yellow Rose Hotel, the County Jail, and the lawyer's office, along with the rest of the Spirit Of The West park’s buildings, have been left untouched.

Eerie photographs showing long-gone visitors dressed in cowboy costumes are still pinned to the wooden walls, while dust gathers on the bottles of bourbon still standing on bar-room tables at the tourist attraction at Winnard's Perch, near St Columb Major in Cornwall.

A photographer, who uses the name Urbex-SW and took these pictures, said: 'What was once a happy, bustling and buzzing location has been left to ruin.

'I’ve seen some amazing places, but this was something so different from all the rest.

'What was most interesting was the pictures of the families who visited the park when it was open as they capture the happiness and excitement of the children.'
