Most young couples could only dream of buying a luxury four-bedroom apartment in the center of Manhattan.

But Chelsea Clinton, 33, and husband Marc Mezvinsky, 35, are about to swap their $4 million pad for a huge new $10.5 million one nearby.

The former first daughter and Mr Mezvinksy - who married in 2010 - are believed to have spotted the 5,000 sq ft property while out walking in the area.

Couple: Chelsea Clinton and her husband Marc Mezvinsky, seen here last November, have bought a luxury $10.5 million penthouse in Manhattan

The apartment is located in The Whitman building next to Madison Square Park, one of the most desirable corners of Manhattan's Flatiron District.

They signed a contract for the property, which has stunning views of the park, last month, according to the New York Post.

Her father, former US President Bill Clinton and mother - ex-Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton - are understood to have run their eyes over the couple's home during a visit last week.

Her famous parents even agreed to pose for photographs with tradesmen who were carrying out work there, the Post reports.

The building, which is being marketed by Douglas Elliman Real Estate, has one apartment on each floor and boasts various security features, including a key operated lift.

Luxury: Overlooking Madison Square Park the couple's new home is beautifully finished and boasts state-of-the-art appliances

Beauty: The apartment features high ceilings and elegantly decorated rooms. Built in the new-Georgian style in 1924, the property has been completely renovated

Comfort: The building has been fitted with a top-of-the-range kitchen complete with the latest high quality appliances

Space: There is plenty of room for the couple's toothbrushes in the apartment's huge bathroom, which is fitted out in Italian marble

Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky's level has four bedrooms, six and a half bathrooms, a home office and a den. It also has a 252 sq ft planting terrace and a private storage unit is included with the property.

The five-story building also boasts 'top-of-the-line' amenities, including a full time doorman, residents' only gym and a refrigerated package room.

The couple's apartment has a massive living area with timber floors and is flooded with natural light thanks to floor to ceiling windows.

The property's kitchen would be any amateur cook's dream, with a glass splash-back, a large marble worktop and state-of-the-art appliances.

The spacious bedrooms in decadent New York home are equally doused in natural light with large windows overlooking the street. And the bathrooms, covered in grey marble tiles, are roomy and ultra modern.

Ms Clinton married Mr Mezvinsky in Rhinebeck, 
New York at a ceremony attended by many of America's most powerful 
figures.

She was first reported to be in a relationship with Mr Mezvinsky in 2005, and became engaged to him over Thanksgiving weekend in 2009.

The couple's current flat on Fifth Avenue is far from shabby either - boasting three bedrooms, two bathrooms as well as a gym and doorman.

The 1,922 sq ft condo is in the Grand Madison - a building that has been dubbed 'the most elegant and historical building downtown.'

They will presumably sell the $4 million home, which boasts 'unforgettable views' over downtown Manhattan including Madison Square Park, the Flatiron Building and the Clock Tower - an extraordinary domed white marble building on 25th Street at Madison.

According to a Douglas Ellisman listing, the couple's 'starter pad' has a powder room, an open chef's kitchen with beautiful Bluestone countertops, oak floors, Italian marble bathrooms, huge windows, 10' ceilings and scores of luxury finishes.

But their already hefty mortgage payments - around $18,460 a month if they paid a 20 per cent downpayment - are set to skyrocket.

Assuming Ms Clinton and Mr Mezvinsky put down a $2.1 million deposit on the their new $10.5 million home, their monthly mortgage bill will be in the region of $52,000 and closer to $60,000 if the couple also handed over a 10 per cent downpayment.

Position: The apartment block is in East 26th Street, one of New York's most exclusive addresses, and boasts views over Madison Square Park

Connections: The couple pose with Ms Clinton's parents, Bill Clinton and Hilary Rodham Clinton at their wedding in 2010
