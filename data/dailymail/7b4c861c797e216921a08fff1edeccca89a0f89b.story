Police were called to a Church of England primary school after parents allegedly threatened to stab each other in front of young children.

The group of mothers and father were seen screaming at each other in the brawl at St John's C of E primary school in Dorking, Surrey. 

They were then heard to make the alleged death threats by a mother who was dropping off her terrified children.

Police were called toSt Johns C of E primary school in Dorking,Surrey after parents threatened to stab each other in front of young children

One mother, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, said: 'They were shouting and screaming at each other, with bad language and threatening to stab and kill each other.'

Surrey Police confirmed it had received reports of 'an altercation' at the school just before 9am on Wednesday.

A spokesman said today: 'Officers attended and the matter is being investigated. No arrests have been made at this stage.'

But the witness, who was not involved in the fracas,  said it's not the first time police have been called  to the school over parents' fighting.

'It's disgusting....it's a primary school, this should not be going on,' the mother added.

'I don't want to send my kid there in that environment, and I am not the only parent that has complained, but I can't get him in any other school as they are all full.

'I don't want him subjected to it. But if I take him out we will be done for absences.

'Sooner or later someone is going to get hurt. It's beyond unbelievable what happens. 

Surrey Police confirmed it had received reports of 'an altercation' at the school just before 9am on Wednesday.

'The police will soon have to start being there for morning drop-offs. Enough is enough, kids are picking up bad behaviour.

'It's not the school's fault, but it is their fault for not acting. It's not them, it's parents, but it's going on in school premises in front of children.

'These parents were threatening to kill each other in front of their kids and other people's children.' 

St Johns C of E has denied violence involving parents is a regular occurrence, and claims 'only one other incident in the past few months has involved police'.

A spokesman said Wednesday morning's incident happened outside the school gates, not in the playground, and was 'a private matter'. 

He added 'It is completely unacceptable behaviour by parents, and I am concerned that other parents and children witnessed it. 

'This incident is being dealt with by the police, because the issues over which the argument took place were private issues, happening outside the school.

'We are liaising with the police, and assisting them where possible to make sure that this does not happen again.

'I am very sorry that this has happened, and I am also very keen to make sure that the school environment is kept safe for everyone, particularly the children.' 

The school was put into special measures in February 2013 and became an academy in November 2013, sponsored by the Guildford Diocese. 

St John's has 164 children on roll and last month it received a 'satisfactory' report following its Statutory Inspection of Anglican and Methodist Schools report.
