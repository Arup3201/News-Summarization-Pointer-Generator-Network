Leicester City director of football Terry Robinson has been sacked following the club's alarming slide down table.

Robinson was informed of the decision by chief executive Susan Whelan, with the Foxes having gone 11 games without a Premier League victory.

Leicester are rock-bottom of the Barclays Premier League following a run of eight defeats in nine games and Robinson has paid the price for that poor form.

Sportsmail understands the decision to axe Robinson is based purely on footballing reasons and nothing to do with allegations that he made a racist remark to a member of staff earlier this year.

He survived inquiries by both his club and the FA over the alleged incident - as revealed by Sportsmail in September.

It was claimed Robinson, a former FA international committee member and Sheffield United chairman, described a Leicester employee as a ‘darkie’ while in a group conversation at the training ground.

There was enough concern around the club, including among some of the players when they found out about it, for the FA to be informed by a third party.

The FA took the claim seriously enough to conduct a thorough inquiry.

However, it was found there was no case to answer because none of those involved had made a complaint.

Leicester conducted their own probe following the FA’s verdict and came to the same conclusion.

Sportsmail understands that Nigel Pearson's job is not under threat with belief at the club that not enough players were signed in the summer. 

A Leicester statement read: 'Leicester City Football Club has terminated the contract of its Director of Football, Terry Robinson. He departs with immediate effect and with the best wishes of everyone at the Football Club.

'Current Academy Director Jon Rudkin will assume the responsibilities of Director of Football.

'Jon has been with Leicester City Football Club for 16 years, has headed the Club’s Academy - recently awarded the Elite Player Performance Plan’s Category One status - since 2003 and has an excellent understanding of the Club's footballing philosophy and values.

'The owners, directors, management and staff at Leicester City would like to place on record our collective thanks to Terry for his work and contribution, and wish him well in future.'
