The bodies of the mother and father along with their three young children were found in the Saco, Maine apartment after the murder-suicide

They were found by a person affiliated with the management company that runs the apartment building where they lived, after a family friend expressed concern about their well-being.

After finding the bodies at Riverview Apartments - located at 35 Water St - the person contacted police.

Authorities have since said it is a self-contained crime scene and that they do not suspect any outside involvement, suggesting the scene was a murder suicide.

Police also said the public do not have anything to worry about.
