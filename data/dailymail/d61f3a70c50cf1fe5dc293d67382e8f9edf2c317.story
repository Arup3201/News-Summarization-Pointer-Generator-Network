A family has been left devastated after a father and son both battling terminal illnesses died within days of each other.

Sam Claridge, 24, had a serious lung condition but died from a sudden heart attack at his mother's house.

Just six days later his heartbroken father Martin Claridge, 54, passed away after losing a long battle with cancer.

The deaths have left the Claridge family, including Martin's mother Ivy, brothers Peter and Derek and sister Peggy, devastated.

'Sam was a cheerful young man and he was very popular with lots of friends,' a statement from the family said.

'Sam's parents divorced when he was quite young but he still had a lot of contact with his father while he was growing up and continued to have contact with both parents after setting up home on his own.

'Several fund raising events were held, to help Sam's mother with the cost of his funeral, all of which were well supported.'

Sam, of Fishponds, Bristol, had known he was terminally ill for five years but was expected to live into his 30s.

He died on September 10, shortly after leaving Frenchay Hospital in Bristol where he was an outpatient for his lung problem.

His father Martin, who had worked as a self-employed builder in Bristol for more than 30 years, died on September 16.

Martin, of Stapleton, Bristol, had been fighting pancreatic cancer for 15 months which had spread to other parts of his body.

The family statement added: 'Martin took a lot of pride in his work and enjoyed smaller projects where he could remodel the inside of a property and make it look like new.

'He was a well-travelled man and liked to have holidays abroad whenever he could to places such as Spain, Cyprus, Tobago, Thailand, France and Italy as well as travelling around the UK.'

Both funerals, to be held in Bristol, will take place this week.
