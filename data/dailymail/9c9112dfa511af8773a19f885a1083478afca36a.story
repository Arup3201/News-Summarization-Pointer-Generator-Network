A friend of the disgraced PR executive who became globally notorious following a tasteless tweet about AIDs has offered a defense of her - of sorts.

Jeff Bercovici said that Justine Sacco clearly made a mistake when she posted a Tweet saying that she hoped she didn't get AIDs during a trip to South Africa, but she was 'still figuring out' Twitter.

Bercovici called the move 'a failure of judgment and a poor attempt at expression' in a column for Forbes.com.

Justine Sacco has no idea her offensive tweet made the news because she is on a flight to Africa

Jeff Bercovici, a friend of fired PR woman Justine Sacco says her tweet was simply an attempt at making a job - albeit a shocking poor one

Sacco posted the offensive Tweet just before getting on a 12-hour flight from London to Cape Town.

It caught the attention of reporters during the flight and her company put out a statement before she landed saying that she would no longer be working for IAC.

She was on her way to South Africa to visit relatives as her family had lived in the country until 1994 when her father moved them to the United States, which he said- in an ironic twist- to avoid the racism he felt in Cape Town.

'I interpreted it as a self-deprecating joke about white guilt and Western privilege — about the sheepish feeling of being physically close to tragedy while remaining safe in an economic and cultural bubble,' Mr Berkovici wrote.

Before being fired, Sacco was the head of corporate communications and had clients that included Match.com, College Humor and About.com.

Much of her position at the company involved her dealing directly with reporters. Berkovici writes that she straddled the line of being approachable while professional in her work.

Career suicide: IAC says that they will take 'appropriate action' against the tweet sent by Justine Sacco (pictured above in shots from her Facebook account) with the high powered executive likely to lose her job

Before she took down all of her social
 media footprints following the firestorm when she landed in South 
Africa, Buzzfeed collected a series of her other offensive tweets, 
proving that she was having trouble understanding the potential 
backlash.

'Although she'd been using the service for several years, Justine was still figuring out its nuances,' Mr Berkovici said.

'One thing she'd notice was that people seemed to like the tweets that were a little bit risque or outrageous.'

One such tweet came on January 30, when she wrote: 'I can't be fired for things I say while intoxicated right?'

Another
 came more recently, on October 8: 'As I sit and eat a bagel with lox, i
 would like to send love to my jews who are all starving themselves 
right now. #hungryhungryhebrews'.

You most certainly can: This tweet Sacco wrote in January may have been a self fulfilling prophecy

What a mess: Sacco will have some explaining to do for her sloppy behavior on twitter

Sacco,
 who is a South African native, issued an apology but not before her own
 father greeted her at the airport and said that she was a 'f****** 
idiot'.

She said she was 
sorry 'for being insensitive to this crisis -- which does not 
discriminate by race, gender or sexual orientation, but which terrifies 
us all uniformly -- and to the millions of people living with the virus,
 I am ashamed.'

'Unfortunately, it is terribly easy to be cavalier about an epidemic that one has never witnessed firsthand.'

‘This is my father's country, and I 
was born here. I cherish my ties to South Africa and my frequent visits,
 but I am in anguish knowing that my remarks have caused pain to so many
 people here; my family, friends and fellow South Africans. I am very 
sorry for the pain I caused.’
