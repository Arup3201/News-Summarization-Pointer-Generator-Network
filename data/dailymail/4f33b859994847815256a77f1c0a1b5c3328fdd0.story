Move over Baloo, there's another bear with an itch to scratch.

This is the hilarious moment a bear was seen mimicking the famous character from Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book.

Just like Baloo, this grizzly bear wasn't shy about scratching in front of others and happily rubbed his back to find the sweet spot.

Stretching out tall with one hind leg kicked-out, this is the moment a grizzy bear mimicked Jungle Book character Baloo by using a wall at Rostov-on-Dov Zoo in Russia to satisfy an itch

Oh that feels bear-y nice; the grizzy has a satisfied look after fully extending against the wall to scratch an out of reach spot, as one member of the crowd shouted out 'Baloo', much to the amusement of other bear lovers

The bear sauntered up to the wall, according to onlookers, before stretching out in itch scratching ecstasy

Spotted by photographer, Grigor 
Khangeldyan, 52, at Rostov-on-Dov Zoo in Russia, the bear slowly 
approached the wall before leaning back in a rather extravagant manner.

The amusing moment entertained spectators with one member of the crowd even shouting the word 'Baloo' as the large mammal scratched, sending the crowd into fits of laughter.

A regular visitor to the zoo, Grigor often heads straight towards the bear enclosure as it is his favourite animal to photograph.

Grigor said: 'The bear sauntered over to the wall, stood up on his hinds and began scratching his back.

'Everyone was giggling but then someone shouted 'Baloo' from the crowd which made everyone laugh.

'I got a great picture of it leaning up against the wall holding its hand in the air, I was very pleased looking back at the photograph as it is very amusing.

'It really did remind me of the moment Baloo-the-bear uses a tree to scratch it's back in Disney's version of The Jungle Book.'
