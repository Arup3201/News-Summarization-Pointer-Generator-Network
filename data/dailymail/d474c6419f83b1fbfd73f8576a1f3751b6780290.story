Tottenham are ready to join Sunderland in the race for Valencia midfielder Ever Banega.

Black Cats boss Gus Poyet looks to be pole position to land the Argentina man ahead of next season.

But new Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino, a compatriot of Banega, is also a fan and is keen to explore a move for the 25-year-old.

Out of favour: Banega (left) was sent out on loan last season and could be available for just £5.5million

New man: Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is keen on bringing his compatriot Banega to White Hart Lane

Banega was left out of Argentina's World Cup squad and will now concentrate on securing his next move.

He was sent out on loan to Newell's Old Boys last season and is likely to be available for around £5.5million this summer.

Pochettino has prioritised a new left-back and central-defender this summer.

Swansea's Ben Davies os an option at left-back, while Southampton centre-back Dejan Lovren could follow Pochettino to White Hart Lane.
