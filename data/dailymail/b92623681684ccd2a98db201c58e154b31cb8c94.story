For Europe's Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley, choosing his three wild card selections for the match at Gleneagles later this month proved an exercise in the three Rs.

There was romance in opting for Stephen Gallacher to make his cup debut at a venue just 30 or so miles from his home in Linlithgow. There was Ian Poulter, the racing certainty. Then came cold reality, and the agonising decision of having to choose between Luke Donald and Lee Westwood.

McGinley was standing next to him as his foursomes partner when Donald almost died of stage fright on his debut at Oakland Hills in 2004. 'He was just besotted with nerves for the first six holes,' he said.

Since 2000, European captains' picks have a hugely impressive Ryder Cup record:

Wins - 25

Losses - 11

Halves - 7

Europe have won five Ryder Cups out of six in that period.

The Dubliner has been there every step of the way, watching the Englishman grow into one of the finest Ryder Cup players of all time. But still he felt he couldn't pick him.

'It was the shortest of short heads between Lee and Luke,' confirmed McGinley. 'But in August at the Bridgestone Invitational and the USPGA Championship we saw a little flourish of form from Lee that Luke was not able to show. There were no green shoots of form from him and that proved the difference.'

Sometimes you shake your head in amazement on these occasions but McGinley is such a clear thinker that even if you disagreed with any of his choices you had to respect the sound logic.

Forget the red herring that he would be hidebound by statistics. 'These selections were primarily about a captain's instincts,' he said, which is as it should be.

At the press conference at Wentworth, the excitement felt by Gallacher, even down a crackly phone line, was plain. 'I've been dreaming about playing in the Ryder Cup all my days,' said the 39-year-old Scot, and given the identity of his uncle Bernard — eight times a player, thrice captain — it might almost literally be true.

VIDEO Ian Poulter's incredible story 

For:

Gallacher's last five strokeplay results at Gleneagles are: 2nd (2013), 6th (2012), 6th (2011), 14th (2010), 10th (2008).

Against:

The Scot has never won a singles match in seven attempts at a major event. 

He has played in the World Golf Championship matchplay event, the Royal Trophy, the Seve Trophy, Volvo Match Play and the Eurasia Cup.

It was vital for the health of European golf that a player who went out to the Italian Open last week and came so close to the top two finish he needed to make the team automatically — he finished third — received his due. Imagine if he had been overlooked? What sort of message would that have sent out, going forward, to all those who loyally support the European Tour?

After qualifying for the team in similar circumstances in 2004, McGinley (below) recognised that more than anyone.

'Picking Stephen was an easy one,' he said. 'He showed me last week he deserved a place on this team. It wasn't just the 65 he shot on Sunday, the second best round of anyone on the day. On Friday he stood 14 shots off the lead at one point but came home in 30 and showed exactly how much he wanted it.

'Let's be clear. I haven't done Stephen a favour by picking him. His performances demanded he be picked.'

The other easy one was Poulter, currently on a wondrous run of seven successive victories in Ryder Cup matches. 'He's always up for the Ryder Cup challenge, isn't he?' said McGinley, smiling, and the Englishman was only too willing to concur.

'I made 24 birdies in the tournament last week and the encouraging thing for me is that I am starting to hole some putts again,' said Poulter. 'I've got three weeks now and I can guarantee I will be ready.'

Then came the difficult bit. The pick that left a knot in McGinley's stomach. The first call he made after making his mind up was to Donald, to get the worst bit out of the way.

'He was desperately disappointed and I know the next time I see him in person it is going to be a very difficult conversation,' said McGinley.

'Let's not get it out of perspective. There are much harder things to take in life than the Ryder Cup. But in sporting terms it was the hardest phone call I have ever had to make.'

The other thing that swung it Westwood's way was his influence in the locker room, a fact recognised by the player himself.

'I think I've got more experience than most captains and if Paul wants me to practise with the rookies or talk to them or help in any way, almost like a playing vice-captain if you like, I'm very happy to do that,' he said.

This will be Westwood's ninth Ryder Cup — only Sir Nick Faldo (11), Christy O'Connor and Bernhard Langer (both 10) have played more — and the pride he feels is obvious.

This is only the second time he has been picked, and he recognised he will be under more pressure. But the man who admitted he lost his spark in July is sounding a lot more like his old, formidable self. The Ryder Cup can do that for a man.

'The spark is definitely back, I'm swinging the club a lot better and I'm more focused,' said Westwood, who will add this week's Wales Open to his schedule before the Ryder Cup to make sure he is acclimatised.

The three selections complete a strong European team, led by current major winners Rory McIlroy and Martin Kaymer. It won't be as easy at Gleneagles as many think — the Americans are better than advertised — but the home side will deservedly start as clear favourites.
