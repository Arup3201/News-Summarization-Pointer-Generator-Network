Two kittens have been saved after they were covered in yellow paint and abandoned in a cardboard box at the side of the road in China.

The animals were only discovered when a nearby resident heard them crying and went to investigate. 

Animal rights campaigners today blasted whoever left them there, labelling the act 'terribly cruel'.

Yue You Meng, from Guangzhou, said she was walking down the road when she realised the noise was coming from a battered cardboard box.

She said: 'When I opened it up I saw the two kittens inside covered in sticky yellow paint.

'It had almost dried and their legs were stuck together, they were stuck together, and even their eyes had been closed by the paint. 

'They were really in a pitiful state so I picked the box up and took them home where I tried to clean off some of the paint.'

But the 27-year-old was unable to remove the paint and took the animals to a vet who had to cut off their fur.

A vet painstakingly cut the paint-covered fur off both the kittens, which took several hours. They were then wrapped in tiny blankets

A spokesman for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said: 'Slapping paint on animals is terribly cruel and could cause allergic reactions, blood poisoning and other life-threatening complications, including suffocation. 

'Unfortunately, this type of abuse is legal in China, where there are no penalties for abusing animals. 

'PETA Asia regularly communicates with municipal governments in China in an effort to implement better animal welfare legislation, including dispelling myths about rabies and assisting with other animal control issues.'

Miss Yue added: 'The kittens are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears.

'But they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut-off.

The 27-year-old said: 'They are better now and can walk around and do not seem to have suffered any permanent damage to their eyes or ears. But they still look really poorly because they had so much fur cut-off'

'They are very resilient and despite the bad start in life they are already starting to play around with each other like ordinary kittens.' 

It is unclear whether the kittens were accidentally covered in paint and abandoned or deliberately targeted before being dumped. 

Police are not investigating.
