Eight families who lost loved ones in the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 disaster when it was shot out of the sky in rebel-controlled eastern Ukraine are preparing to sue Russia, Ukraine and Malaysia.

The Boeing 777 was travelling from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17 when it was downed, killing all 298 people on board, including 38 Australian citizens and residents.

It is not known which of the families are suing, however News.com.au reports they are from five different states across Australia and will also take action against Malaysia Airlines.

Aviation lawyer Jerry Skinner, who is based in Alaska, has taken up their case and is preparing to lodge it at the European Court of Human Rights.

Flowers laid out on the wreckage of MH17 in eastern Ukraine after the tragic disaster in July

Back in July the lawyer first told the Sydney Morning Herald that he could potentially achieve million dollar payouts for the MH17 victims’ families, like he had obtained from Libya for the families of the 1988 Lockerbie disaster.

'Something creative is going to have to be done here because this is too big and too complicated for the judicial system to handle on its own and it involves people who will not yield to the judicial system, such as the Russians and the Ukrainians,' he said.

‘What happened in Lockerbie was that politics got involved and sanctions got involved and we said to the Libyans, if you want to settle this, it doesn't matter what the individuals did [for a living].

‘The parties that are the main participants here are probably the Russians and their allies and also Malaysia Airlines. Both of them bear a lot of responsibility for this.’

Now, Mr Skinner has said he will file a ‘very broad’ claim against Russia, Ukraine, Malaysia and Malaysia Airlines as soon as he gets some final information from the Dutch Safety Board.

The airline has already promised to pay compensation out to the victims’ families and is liable to pay about $180,000 for each person killed.

Amongst the Australian victims of MH17 were the three Maslin children, whose bodies finally arrived back on Australian soil in October.

The bodies of Mo, 12, Evie, 10 and Otis, 8, were returned to their loved ones in Perth after arriving on board an RAAF Globemaster transport plane in Melbourne.

They are believed to have arrived alongside a number of other victims of the tragedy.

Families of the deceased were seen waiting at Melbourne airport as the plane arrived and watched as the coffins were removed from the plane.

In July, the parents of the three Maslin children released a statement addressed to 'the soldiers in the Ukraine, the politicians, the media, our friends and family'.

Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris wrote: 'Our pain is intense and relentless. We live in a hell beyond hell.

'Our babies are not here with us – we need to live with this act of horror, every day and every moment for the rest of our lives.

'No one deserves what we are going through. Not even the people who shot our whole family out of the sky.'

Sons, daughters, couples, parents and grandparents were all among the people who never made it home to Australia after the tragic disaster.

Emma Bell, who was in her 20s, worked with Aboriginal children in a remote Northern Territory community and was spending the school holidays in Europe before boarding MH17 in Amsterdam. She was returning to the Northern Territory for the new term. 

A 25-year-old, Sydney man named Jack O’Brien, was flying back home after enjoying a 'fantastic seven-week holiday in Europe'. 

And just one of the couples on board was Queenslanders Howard Horder and his wife Susan, both 63, of Albany Creek. They were returning from a trip to Europe after retiring. 

In Germany, a mother of a passenger who died in the MH17 crash is already suing the Ukrainian authorities for 'negligent homicide' and £650,000 in the European Court of Human Rights. 

The German woman, whose daughter - named as 'Olga L' - was killed when the Malaysia Airlines plane, began legal proceedings in the past week. 

She is seeking compensation from the authorities after Ukraine failed to close its airspace to civil air traffic because of fighting with pro-Russian separatists, it has been reported. 

Ukraine’s President Petro Poroshenko is visiting Australia next week and is expected to discuss the security situation in eastern Ukraine and its impact on international relations, as well as the links between Australia and his country.
