A U.S. judge has rejected Apple's demand for a hike to the $1.05billion damages owed to it by South Korean smartphone rival Samsung in the two firms ongoing patent war.

District Judge Lucy Koh also rejected demands from both firms for another trial over claims Samsung unfairly used Apple's iPhone and iPad technology in knock-off products.

She also upheld the validity of the Apple patents at the centre of the dispute.

Head-to-head: Samsung's Galaxy smartphone, left, and Apple's iPhone, right. A U.S. judge yesterday slapped down Apple's demand for an increase to the $1billion damages owed by arch-rival Samsung

A jury last August found that Samsung 
'infringed' six Apple patents to create and market 26 models of 
smartphones and computer tablets and ordered the $1.05billion award.

The jury found several other older Samsung products did not infringe any Apple patents.

Earlier, Judge Koh refused to block 
sales of the infringing products in the U.S. after she said Apple failed
to show demand for the Samsung devices was driven by the purloined 
technology, including the 'pinch-to-zoom' function.

Apple is appealing against that decision.

Samsung contends that only three of the 26 older-generation products are still offered for sale in the U.S.

Apple has filed a new lawsuit 
contending that Samsung's current products are also using Apple 
technology. Judge Koh scheduled a trial for that matter in 2014.

In a series of four orders early today, the judge painstakingly considered each side's myriad claims that the nine-member jury wrongly considered evidence and misread complex patent law.

Since Apple first took Samsung to the court in early 2011, Apple has been more successful in its U.S. litigation campaign, winning the $1.05 billion damage award and a pre-trial sales ban on some Samsung products.

Samsung has since fought back and scored some favourable rulings, including yesterday's ruling that prevents any higher damages.

The ruling also comes as investors worry Apple is losing its dominance in consumer electronics after it missed Wall Street revenue forecasts for the third consecutive quarter last week on weaker-than-expected iPhone sales.

By comparison, Samsung, once seen as quick to copy the ideas of others, now sets the pace in innovation and widened its lead over Apple on the back of aggressive marketing of its wide product range last year.

Shares in Samsung, the world's top smartphone maker by units shipped, closed up 2.2 perc ent on Wednesday in Seoul, beating a 0.4 per cent gain in the wider market.

With a few minor exceptions, the judge concluded that the jurors were right as far as the law goes.

'Accordingly, the trial was fairly conducted, with uniform time limits and rules of evidence applied to both sides,' the judge said.

'A new trial would be contrary to the interests of justice.'

The judge is still considering Samsung's demands to reduce the $1.05billion award. The jurors had filled out a verdict form listing damages Samsung owed Apple for each of the 26 products it ruled used infringing technology.

Samsung argues that many of the line-item calculations were done incorrectly and that it was due a big reduction in the award.

Apple spokeswoman Kristin Huguet declined to comment and a Samsung spokesman did not respond to emails.

At a hearing in December, the judge seemed inclined to rework at least a few of the jury's damages calculations, but gave no indication by what amount.

The world's top two smartphone makers, Apple and Samsung and are locked in a no-holds-barred, global battle for supremacy of a market worth $346billion a year.

Lawyers for both sides have appeared in courts around the globe accusing each other of stealing technology and trade infractions.

International Data released a report on Friday showing smartphone shipments soared 36 per cent worldwide in the fourth quarter as the sleek devices supplanted personal computers and other gadgets on holiday shopping lists.

Samsung Electronics retained its bragging rights as the smartphone leader, shipping nearly 64million devices for a 29 per cent share of the global market.

Apple ranked second with nearly 48million iPhones shipped during the fourth quarter, translating into a market share of 22 per cent.
