A New Zealand café has been slammed and boycotted for printing a distasteful joke about Oscar Pistorius on their receipts.

A picture of the Wellington café's joke was published on social media by one of its outraged customers.

'Oscar Pistorius was super keen to get a new bathroom door, but his girlfriend was dead against it,' the joke read on Scorch-O-Rama's receipt.

Wellington café Scorch-O-Rama has been slammed for a distasteful joke that was printed on their receipts 

The joke (left) refereed to Oscar Pistorious who was found guilty of manslaughter earlier this year after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead through the bathroom door (right)

Pistorious was found guilty of manslaughter earlier this year after shooting his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp dead through the bathroom door.

Since the picture was shared, the café has received a chain of complaints on its Facebook page from customers who are outraged at the venue's light approach on domestic violence.

'How could anyone think that a case of domestic violence that ends in a woman's death is funny? You disgust me,' Carrie Bee wrote. 

Another Facebook user, Jull Southen, added: 'You obviously did not watch any of the Pistorious trial or you would have seen the distress caused to many people. I don't know how you could think this sad incident was funny... get real!'

The complaints are largely concerned by the venue's light approach on domestic violence.

Café owner Keith Morrison has since publicly apologised for the joke and donated $1000 to a Women's Refuge.

'Sometimes our brains are the last thing to engage, when they should be the first,' Mr Morrison wrote on his business' Facebook page, according to TVNZ.

'We truly are sorry and removed it as soon as we had that vital moment of awareness,' he wrote. 

'The comment was in bad taste and has been removed. We apologise again for any hurt or distress we caused people - it was absolutely never our intention.'

A former employee, James Blake, also took to social media to defend his former boss

A former employee, James Blake, also took to social media to defend his former boss saying: 'Although he overstepped the mark this time, you wouldn't meet a more caring and sensitive guy. 

'He acknowledges his mistake. I can testify to his character and his remorse is sincere.

'His humour and wit was one of the best parts of working at the cafe but this time it seems it has gotten the better of him. I'm sad for him and hope people give him a second chance as all people make mistakes.'
