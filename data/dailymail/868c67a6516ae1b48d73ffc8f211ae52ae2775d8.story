Some vulnerable elderly people are sent a different carer every week to look after their most personal needs, a think-tank claimed yesterday.

In some cases, it said, frail pensioners must allow 50 people a year into their homes to help them with vital everyday care such as dressing and washing.

The problem has resulted from a high turnover of care workers, according to an inquiry commission headed by former Care Minister Paul Burstow.

‘Some care recipients have reported having 50 different care workers in their home over a year,’ it said.

The claim follows deepening concern at the 15-minute visit system that many care workers funded by local councils have to work under. These strict time-tables leave them no more than a quarter of an hour with each elderly person they are helping.

Vulnerable residents can be given different carers each week in areas where the firms that supply care services are unable to recruit enough staff, said the commission.

It examined a diary kept by an anonymous care worker in the North East, saying: ‘Although she is familiar with most of the people she sees and can provide continuity of care, some of her time is spent covering areas where the company she works for is short-staffed.

‘This means that she is unlikely to have seen these people before and may never see them again.

‘She becomes part of the parade of unfamiliar workers who may come into someone’s bedroom and bathroom and take care of their intimate personal care needs.’

Staff turnover at care provider firms is running at 20 per cent a year, twice the average for firms in all sectors of the economy, said the inquiry led by the former Liberal Democrat minister. One reason for discontent, it said, is that 220,000 out of 685,000 carers are paid only for the time they spend inside people’s homes. Travel from one home to another is not included.

‘This means that where there is significant travel time between appointments, particularly in relation to the amount of paid- for contact time, care workers’ effective wage can be less than the minimum wage,’ said the commission.

Former care and support minister Paul Burstow's damning report says that the service – designed to free up beds by keeping people out of hospital – is ‘not working’

‘This is illegal. To make matters worse, it is also common practice for compassionate care workers to give a little extra time to their clients when care slots seem inadequate.

‘While this is the kind of person we would want to look after an aged parent, this puts their effective hourly wage further at risk.’

Pay is depressed further as zero-hours contracts are used for six in ten care workers, the report said. It called for councils to pay more so staff receive the ‘living wage’ of £9.15 an hour in London and £7.85 outside.

This means local authorities would have to pay £21.33 an hour to firms employing carers in the capital and £18.59 elsewhere, said the report.

Thousands of dementia patients living in their own homes are not getting enough help from carers or their GP, another report has warned.

Almost half do not feel they are supported by their family doctor – or offered regular check-ups. A fifth are not given enough help with basic tasks at home such as cooking and washing and the same proportion feel they have no control over their lives.

Dementia Action Alliance – an umbrella group of charities behind the report – is calling for an overhaul of dementia care.

Issued by the Local Government Information Unit think-tank, it added that care workers should be better trained and their jobs held in higher regard.

It also called for them to be given ‘key worker’ status to help them find housing. The Local Government Association, which represents councils, said: ‘We rely on care workers to keep our social care system running and support people who can often have complex needs.

‘It is important they are paid a fair wage and have the best possible training and local authorities understand and take account of the cost of providing this.

‘The backdrop of 40 per cent cuts to local government funding during the current Parliament and increasing pressure from Government to drive down the costs of care have forced councils to ask providers to run services on tighter margins.’

The call for care workers to be paid the living wage comes at a time when even employers sympathetic to higher pay are finding difficulties putting this into practice. Last year, the Church of England admitted that it employed 70 workers on less than the living wage in its sheltered housing scheme for retired clergy.
