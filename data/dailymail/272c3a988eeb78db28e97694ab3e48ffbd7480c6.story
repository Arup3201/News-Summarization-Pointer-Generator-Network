The 2011 killing of an unarmed black man by a small-town police chief in South Carolina was a senseless act of violence and the officer must be convicted of murder because everyone should be treated the same under the law, a prosecutor said Wednesday.

But a defense lawyer said former Eutawville Police Chief Richard Combs was trying to serve a lawfully obtained arrest warrant and the legal system would not work if people could just leave instead of being taken into custody.

Opening arguments started Wednesday in Combs' murder trial. He faces 30 years to life in prison if convicted.

'Senseless': Solicitor David Pascoe said in opening statements Tuesday that Bernard Bailey was 'gunned down in an absolutely senseless act of violence' by Eutawville police chief David Pascoe in 2011

Unarmed: Bernard Bailey was shot and killed by new police chief Richard Combs outside the Eutawville town hall in May 2011

Combs was indicted shortly after grand juries produced no indictments against white officers in the deaths of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and in New York. He was the third white officer indicted in 2014 in a shooting of an unarmed black man in South Carolina.

Both sides agree Combs shot Bernard Bailey outside Eutawville Town Hall in May 2011 after an argument over a ticket for a broken taillight the chief gave to Bailey's daughter a few days earlier.

Combs' lawyer, John O'Leary, said the chief had a warrant to arrest Bailey on an obstruction of justice charge after the argument over the ticket and people can't just leave when they are being arrested. As a small-town police chief, he didn't have a stun gun or pepper spray, so he had no choice but to fire his gun as Bailey tried to back away with Combs in the truck.

Solicitor David Pascoe said Bailey was 'gunned down in an absolutely senseless act of violence,' shot three times as he simply backed out to escape an escalating situation. Pascoe told jurors Combs must follow the law, even if he is a police officer.

'Whether he wears a badge or not, the law must treat everyone equal,' Pascoe said.

A jury of seven blacks and five whites was seated Tuesday evening.

Combs' attorneys had asked to move the trial to another county, but later withdrew their request. 

The shooting happened in May 2011. Bailey's daughter received a traffic ticket from the chief for a broken taillight and called her father to the scene. Bailey and Combs argued, but eventually went their separate ways. The police chief got an arrest warrant for Bailey for obstruction. A few days later, Bailey went to Town Hall to argue about his daughter's ticket. When he showed up, the chief tried to arrest Bailey, a 6-foot-6 former prison guard.

Prosecutors said Bailey marched back to his truck, and Combs tried to get inside to turn off the ignition. The two briefly fought, and Combs shot Bailey, 54, twice in the chest.

Combs said he was tangled in Bailey's steering wheel and feared for his life if Bailey drove away. Last month, a judge threw out his self-defense claim and ruled Combs should have let Bailey leave.

In March 2013, the Justice Department cleared Combs. Pascoe announced he would begin his own investigation and in August of that year, a grand jury indicted Combs on the misconduct charge.

David S. Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami, said that was an unusual way to handle the case. Pascoe wouldn't talk about the grand jury proceedings. 

Combs' bail was set at $150,000. He is unemployed. He was placed on leave after the shooting, and the town let him go six months later.

In August 2014, Bailey's family reached a $400,000 wrongful death settlement with Eutawville, which is 50 miles southeast of Columbia.

They said they don't think this case should be compared with Ferguson and New York because everyone in Eutawville knows everyone.

'That is comparing oranges and apples,' said Bailey's widow, Doris Bailey.

Eutawville has about 300 residents, one-third of them black. Its Main Street has a hardware store, a pharmacy and medical supply store, and a number of empty storefronts.

One of Bailey's cousins remembered him as a kind person.

'He wasn't the type of person to harm anybody. I don't know why someone would shoot him or take his life from his family. He was good people,' said Betty Williams, 57. 

How it began: The shooting happened in May 2011 after Bailey's daughter received a traffic ticket from the chief for a broken taillight and called her father to the scene. Bailey and Combs argued, but eventually went their separate ways

Shot dead: Days later, Bailey went to Town Hall to argue about his daughter's ticket. The chief tried to arrest Bailey, a 6-foot-6 former prison guard. Bailey marched back to his truck, and Combs tried to get inside to turn off the ignition. The two briefly fought, and Combs shot Bailey, 54, twice in the chest

Detrick Jenkins Sr., a neighbor of Bailey's who worked with him at a state prison, said he didn't fear riots like in Missouri or the massive protests that happened nationwide after grand juries declined to indict Ferguson officer Darren Wilson and New York officer Daniel Pantaleo. That could change if Combs is found not guilty, Jenkins said.

'People probably won't like it and will have a more aggressive attitude,' said Jenkins, who is black.

Combs worked as a deputy for the Orangeburg County Sheriff's Office for six years before being fired in 2007 for 'unsatisfactory performance,' according to documents from the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy obtained by The Post and Courier of Charleston for a 2011 story. 

Combs completed police chief's training in Eutawville just four days before the fatal shooting, the newspaper reported.

Thomas Bilton, a white Eutawville resident who was friends with Bailey, said the police chief should have let him leave Town Hall that day.

'The whole thing has been kind of crazy,' he said. 'It's taken a long time and I think some of the recent events across the country might have contributed to a final verdict to charge him with murder.' 

'Oranges and apples': In August 2014, Bailey's family reached a $400,000 wrongful death settlement with Eutawville. They said they don't think this case should be compared with Ferguson and New York because everyone in Eutawville knows everyone

Everyone knows everyone: Eutawville is a town of just 300 residents outside Columbia, one-third of them black. Its Main Street has a hardware store, a pharmacy and medical supply store, and a number of empty storefronts
