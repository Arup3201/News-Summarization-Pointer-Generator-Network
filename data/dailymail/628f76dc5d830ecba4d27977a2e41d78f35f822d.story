More than 4,000 nurseries are failing to provide a good standard of care and education - and must improve within two years or face closure.

One in six nurseries and pre-schools - catering for about 150,000 babies and toddlers - need to make improvements, according to education watchdog Ofsted.

Concerns range from poor standards of early education to unsafe premises, gaps in first aid training and staff smoking on the premises.

Following an overhaul of inspections, all childcare providers on ‘non-domestic premises’ – such as nurseries and pre-schools – are expected to achieve a ‘good’ rating from Ofsted.

Those falling short of the benchmark will be given up to two years to shape up or face being labelled as ‘inadequate’, raising the prospect of being de-registered or closed.

It was originally proposed that under-performing providers would be given four years to improve, but the turnaround period was halved amid claims the plan was too lenient.

The new inspection regime – which came into force in autumn last year - also scrutinises standards of early education more closely as well as the progress made by children and their readiness for starting school at four.

Figures released by Ofsted yesterday show that 17 per cent of 23,551 nurseries and other non-domestic providers are currently falling below the ‘good’ benchmark.

Among childminders, the figure is higher, at 23 per cent, although a separate system is used for inspecting and monitoring childminders who require improvement.

Many of the country’s 65,704 registered early years providers were checked under previous inspection blueprints.

Of those visited over the three-month period from April to June this year – the most recent inspection period to incorporate the tough new standards – 28 per cent of nurseries and 23 per cent of childminders were judged to require improvement.

Of 4,177 providers inspected, 423 were ordered to make improvements to early education programmes.

Some 52 were found to be operating in unsafe premises while 105 needed to improve their safeguarding practices.

A total of 47 were censured over first aid training for staff and two for staff smoking rules.

Twenty-six per cent overall were found to require improvement but early years leaders hailed a big improvement on the previous quarter, when 32 per cent were judged to be substandard.

Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said: ‘We are pleased to see such a significant increase in the number of ‘good’ and ‘outstanding’ providers.

‘These figures clearly demonstrate that, despite ongoing funding shortfalls and diminished local authority support, the vast majority of early years providers continue to deliver consistently high-quality learning opportunities to the children in their care.’

But he added: ‘We continue to receive concerns from providers about the conduct of early years inspectors, and the serious questions that have been asked about the fairness and consistency of the inspection process have yet to be adequately answered.’

Last year the then Education Minister Liz Truss warned that some ‘chaotic’ pre-schools allow children to do what they want for most of the day, leaving them unable to sit still and listen by the time they get to primary school.

She said some nurseries were filled with young children ‘running around with no sense of purpose’.

An Ofsted spokesman said yesterday: ‘It is now almost a year since we raised standards for nurseries and other early years providers. So it is heartening that these statistics show that almost three-quarters of our inspections found a good or outstanding service for young children.

‘Parents can be assured that young children at those provisions are in an environment where they can learn and develop.

‘However, there are still too many early years provisions which do not help young children be ready to learn when they start school. In coming months Ofsted will be working with the providers which need to improve.’
