The Duchess of Cambridge's brother has been forced to turn to his family for financial help after his cake business made a loss of £17,000 last year.

James Middleton's family have secured an overdraft after the loss made by his company Nice Group, which sells bread, cakes, flour and sugar confectionery, was revealed in new figures.

He owes creditors £32,575 and the accounts state: 'The bank overdraft is secured by a member of the director's family.'

His parents, Carole and Michael Middleton, run the hugely successful Party Pieces website which has earned the family millions.

But the midas touch has not so far been passed down to son James, 25.

The accounts, signed by Mr Middleton, show the company has stocks of £3,320 and is owed £5,151 by debtors.

But the amount owed to creditors mean the firm is in debt in its first full year of trading to April 30, 2012.

The 25-year-old former public schoolboy dropped out of the University of Edinburgh in 2006 after a year to go into business.

His first venture was the Cake Kit Company. Mr Middleton also runs Nice Cakes Ltd and Nice Wine Ltd, which has filed dormant accounts.

The businessman caused a stir and embarrassed the royal family when a range of 'rude' products were launched last year.

They included a cake called a Stud Muffin featuring a picture of a man with the caption: 'A willy that wriggles and gives me the giggles.'

James Middleton told MailOnline: 'Nice Group is a start-up company and as you can imagine there are overheads needed to start a company.

'I made the decision to finance the business myself along with a loan rather than go to investors.

'This has its pros and cons, it does mean things don’t move as quickly as I would like but it does mean I keep complete ownership and control over my company.

'Further down the line I may look to open the doors for investors but I will see how things go.

'It is not uncommon for start-up 
companies to make a loss in the early stages of development and it is 
not something I am concerned about right now.

'On the contrary I am very excited as 
after running a pilot over 2012, Nice Cakes will be officially launching
 later this year with a brand new website and range of products which I 
am very excited about.'

The accounts are more bad news for the Duchess of Cambridge's siblings.

Pippa
 Middleton's book on entertaining called Celebrate sold just over 2,000 
copies in its first week. She has now replaced Delia Smith as a 
columnist for Waitrose magazine.
