You might not be able to match his sublime tennis skills but you can now replicate the look of number one player Novak Djokovic.

His sponsors Uniqlo are selling replicas of his kit online and in their High Street stores. And you don't need to have a salary like the tennis ace in order to afford it as prices start at £7.90 for a pair of socks or £29.90 for a polo shirt.

Uniqlo have designed different kits for each of the grand slams the Serbian star has played in the last year. Each of the outfits is tailored to the traditions of the tournament or to reflect the values or flag of the country he's competing in.

For example, according to Uniqlo, his kit for January's Australian Open - where he won the title against Andy Murray - featured green stripes 'to highlight awareness for ecological and environmental causes.'

The Japanese brand reveal how Djokovic has a creative influence over the kit he wears as 'the initial design featured stripes all over the T-shirt, but as per Djokovic's request, they were just used on the sleeves.'

As he takes to centre court at Wimbledon today on his quest to win another grand slam, he will of course have to adhere to the rule of the tournament of wearing white.

But the brand's website states that their design director Naoki Takizawa 'opted for a classic white to emphasise Novak's strong physique'.

The kit includes some subtle colouring with a line of brown stitching on one side and the red Uniqlo logo.

Replicas of the white polo shirt with a zip and matching shorts can be purchased for £29.90 each.

When the player was able to wear a colourful kit at last month's French Open, he opted for a light green shade that the brand stated was chosen to make him stand out against the red clay of the Roland Garros courts.

They add it was 'also specifically chosen to represent Djokovic's 'strength and energy - as well as his passion for the French Open.'

Djokovic, who is the 5/4 favourite to lift the men's singles trophy at Wimbledon, will play world number 34 Florian Mayer in his first round match this afternoon.

Sponsorship deals have helped tennis players become some of the world's most wealthiest sports players. Djokovic became a brand ambassador for Uniqlo in May 2012, leaving his previous clothing sponsor, Sergio Tacchini International, because he said he had 'outgrown' their brand.

The Uniqlo collections of his grand slam kits were launched in the stores last month.

The company state that the player had a personal input throughout the design process as 'Takizawa worked extremely closely with Djokovic to develop tennis apparel that matches his uncompromising standards of performance excellence.'

The collections that are on sale include replica's of the kit he competes in as well as his warm up gear and off court casual wear. 

Sports brand Nike have been keen to snap up the world's top players from Roger Federer and Rafal Nadal to Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. But to ensure the players maintain their own individuality and don't appear to be wearing a uniform, they have created distinctive styles and logos for each player. The sale of replica kit and novelty T-shirts is also a clever marketing ploy so tennis fans can declare if they're 'Team Nadal' or 'Team Federer' etc by their choice of clothing.

Individuality: Spain's Rafael Nadal's logo is of a Spanish bull but the T-shit made in his honour, right, turned out to be too true given he won at the French Open on clay but crashed out on Wimbledon's grass in the first round
