Urszula Nowozeniuk arrives at court to give evidence in the trial of her husband, masseur Daniel Pytlarz

The wife of a masseur accused of sexually assaulting 18 women yesterday said she didn’t have the ‘smallest concern’ about her husband’s behaviour.

Urszula Nowozeniuk, 32, was sitting in the reception of the upmarket spa that she owns with Daniel Pytlarz as he allegedly groped his clients in a nearby room.

But giving evidence for his defence, she told Southwark Crown Court: ‘I have never had any doubts in his professionalism or his work.

‘I’ve never, never seen anything that gave me even the smallest concern that something wasn’t right.

'I still regard myself as in a relationship with him. I still regard myself as married to him. I still feel the same way about him.’

Pytlarz was arrested last year after being accused of intimately touching women at the spa, including a former employee of Sir Paul McCartney who received a free massage at the Violet Clinic Body and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, north-west London.

Miss Nowozeniuk, who has been married to Pytlarz for nearly two years, said that she chatted with her after her massage finished and that she ate some of the ginger cookies that she had just baked.

She said: ‘We had a small talk. I asked her if she knew someone from a PR agency as we were thinking to promote the salon and try and get more celebrity clients. She said she would give me a number. She seemed completely normal.’

That evening she got a call from Sir 
Paul’s daughter, Mary McCartney, who is also a client of Pytlarz, 
cancelling the singer’s massage because their plane had got stuck in 
snow in Switzerland.

Pytlarz, 35, had several other celebrity clients including Nancy Dell’olio and members of the Saudi royal family, the court has heard.

His wife said: 'It’s always important for every business to have celebrity clients and people in the media.

'But they all came by recommendation. We haven’t called anyone.’

She
told of the struggle to build up their joint-owned Violet Clinic Body 
and Skincare Spa in St John’s Wood, north west London often working long
hours for seven days a week.

But Miss Nowozeniuk who has been with Pytlarz for eight years and married to him for nearly two, said she was standing by her husband because she believed in him, not because she had to.

She said: 'I can always go home and my parents always welcome me in the family business.

'I could find a job as a beauty therapist all over the world. We had a good relationship. We really supported each other.'

One of Sir Paul McCartney's former employees, who has accused Pytlarz of sexual assault, received a free massage from him the day before Pytlarz was due to give the Beatle and his partner Nancy (pictured) a massage at their London home

As she left the witness stand, she smiled at her smartly dressed husband, who blew her a kiss from behind the glass fronted dock.

Pytlarz earlier told the court he would have been 'insane' to have me sexually abused women in his clinic as his wife was waiting next door.

He said: 'I have got beautiful wife, I’m happily married and we wanted to have a child together.

'I’ve built a business, I’ve got myself up on my feet, why would I do anything to destroy that?’

Pytlaz, from St John’s Wood, denies 21 counts of sexual abuse.

The trial continues.
