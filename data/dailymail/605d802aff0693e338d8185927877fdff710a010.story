Conrad Hilton was driving at 200mph when he hit two cars and crashed on a highway near Palm Springs last month, witnesses claim.

Paris Hilton's 19-year-old brother had to be pulled from his wrecked BMW by the jaws of life after changing lanes, hitting a Volkswagen, and colliding with a tractor trailer on Saturday August 23.

Incredibly, the teenager escaped without a major injury.

'Speeding': Police are investigating claims that Paris Hilton's 18-year-old brother Conrad, pictured in May at LAX, was driving at 200mph when he was involved in a major car crash in Palm Springs last month

Today, it has emerged numerous motorists pulled over to call 911 with reports that Hilton was driving at 200mph, according to TMZ.

Police confirmed they received multiple reports of a reckless driver at the time of the incident, which was also witnessed by a California Highway Patrol helicopter. 

Firefighters then used the jaws of life to pull Hilton from his vehicle before he was taken  to Desert Regional Medical Center. 

According to TMZ, Hilton reportedly skimmed the back of another car when he tried to change lanes, which caused him to hit the back of a tractor trailer before he came to a stop at the side of the road. 

Police determined that alcohol or drugs were not factors in the collision.

MailOnline has contacted Hilton's representative for comment.  

This isn't Hilton's first brush with the law. In 2011, he crashed into two parked cars in Los Angeles after a night out in West Hollywood.

The following year, he was arrested after testing positive for marijuana, which was reportedly a violation of the terms of his probation for a previous marijuana arrest.
