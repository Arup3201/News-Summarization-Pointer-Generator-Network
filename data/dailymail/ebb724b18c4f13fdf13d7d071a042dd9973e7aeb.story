The parents whose two young children were murdered in their New York apartment last year announced the birth of their son today.Â 

Marina and Kevin Krim shared the happy news on a Facebook page  set up in the memory of their two children, two-year-old Leo and six-year-old Lulu who were allegedly stabbed to death by a nanny in their Upper West Side apartment in 2012.

The message, posted on Friday to the Lulu & Leo page, reads: 'From Marina and Kevin Krim -

'We are very excited to share with you that Felix Harrison Krim, all 8 pounds, 10 ounces, and 21.5 inches of him, arrived today. Marina, Felix and all of us are healthy and happy.

'Thank you all so much for your support!'

Marina and Kevin Krim, whose son and daughter were stabbed to death last year, held a fundraiser on Wednesday for the charity set up in honor of their children

Joy: The message from Marina and Kevin Krim was posted to Facebook on Friday, October 12

Baby Felix joins the Krims' 
surviving daughter, four-year-old Nessie, and was born just two weeks before the first anniversary of the horrific murders.

The Facebook announcement has already received more than 5,000 'likes'.

Leo and Lulu, whose full name was Lucia, were murdered at the family's Upper West Side home on October 26, 2012 in a crime that shocked the country.

Mrs Krim arrived home at the family apartment to find two of her two children dead in the bath-tub next to nanny Yoselyn Ortega who had slit her own throat in an alleged suicide attempt.

Nessie escaped injury as she was with her mother at the time.

In January, Mr Krim, an executive at 
America's CNBC television station, said that they are drawing strength 
from their remaining child.

Loss: Two-year-old Leo and his big sister Lulu, six, were found in a pool of blood in the family's home

Victims: Only Nessie, whose picture has been pixelated, escaped harm as she was with her mother

He said: 'Marina and I couldn't be more proud of her - she is very smart, beautiful and tough.

'And she's grown so much over the past two months. She saves us every day.'

The Krim's nanny Yoseyln Ortega, 50, is due to stand trial for the first-degree murder of the two children after being deemed mentally fit.

She has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

When questioned by police after awaking from the coma, the nanny attempted to paint Mrs Krim in a bad light, shifting part of the blame for the tragedy on her.

Ortega, who had told neighbors and family that she was short of money, revealed she resented her employers because they kept telling her what to do and asked her to do the housework, it was reported after the murders.
