Introducing Mango who is a very caring ginger cat who absolutely loves to take care of the family kittens in Louisville, Kentucky, USA and who treats some baby rabbits as if they are his offspring.

Mango, who is a male cat, licks the faces of the three baby rabbits affectionately  during the video and keeps a close eye on them during the footage.

Mango was found under the decking of the owner's house shortly after he was born and despite giving away four of his fellow siblings the pet owner decided to keep Mango and his sister, Chloe. 

The owner says Mango has a long history of caring for foster kittens. 

She says, 'Before I could get his mom fixed, she had a litter of five. When they were old enough to bring inside from their mom, Mango cared for them. I have since fostered around six other feral kittens and once they are out of quarantine, Mango is in there grooming and playing with them.

She added, 'Also, I bred Holland Lop bunnies and it was my first litters that Mango jumped into their exercise pen while they were out of their cages.' 

During the video Mango licks the first white baby rabbit and is also very affectionate towards a second brown baby rabbit that approaches him.
