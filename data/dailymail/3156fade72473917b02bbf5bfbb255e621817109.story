She might only be five, but finger painting is clearly child's play to young artist Aelita Andre.

The little girl, from Melbourne in Australia, has been described as the 'world's youngest professional artist' after earning more than £100,000 from her paintings.

Her work has already featured in two exhibitions and it is about to be displayed in a third, at a gallery in New York next month.

Young Picasso: Aelita Andre has earned more from her paintings at the age of five than most professional artists do in a lifetime

Global success: Aelita's work has already featured in two exhibitions and it is about to be displayed in a third, at a gallery in New York, next month

Painting since the tender age of two,
Aelita's cheapest works are selling for more than £3,000 each and it is
estimated she has already made more than £100,000 from her art - more 
money than most professional artists earn in a lifetime.

The money she earned so far has been 
put into a trust fund by her parents, Russian-born mother Nikka 
Kalashnikova and Australian father Michael Andre.

Nikka said she quickly realised her daughter's approach and technique was different to other children play painting.

She told Sky News: 'Her composition, her use of colour, her concentration span.

'Sometimes
even as a little kid she was painting for about one hour, 
one-and-a-half hours, she would walk off, then come back again, it is 
just her concentration.

'Usually kids paint for two or three minutes and they have had enough, they run off, but not Aelita.'

The youngster had her first solo show last year and next month her work will be exhibited again at the Agora Gallery in New York.

Some cynics have suggested the little girl's work is influenced by her parents. However, to counter those claims, Aelita's father Michael filmed his daughter painting a canvas from beginning to end and posted it on Youtube.

The Melbourne prodigy's paintings have already been compared to modern art greats like Jackson Pollock and Pablo Picasso.

The five-year-old's proud dad said last year: 'She chooses the colours herself. She's so determined, and forceful, and decisive, and she'll actually get angry if you attempt to suggest a colour.'

Aelita began painting before she could walk at 11-months old and now has her own space to create her artworks, mainly using acrylics on canvas.

Once her parents saw that she had a talent, they submitted her work to a local gallery, prompting the owner to arrange a special exhibition for her, unaware of her tender age - then only two years old.

While most of her paintings now retail for between around $5,000 and $10,000 it was a picture of the Russian Mir space station that set her record price of $24,000 in Hong Kong.

Her parents have insisted they do not force her to paint and that her work should be judged on its artistic merits and not her age. They also hope her success paves the way for other talented children.

Michael added: 'Aelita had a very, very difficult run. When her work was initially judged, it was purely on the painting itself. Nikka deliberately withheld her age just to see what the reaction was.'
