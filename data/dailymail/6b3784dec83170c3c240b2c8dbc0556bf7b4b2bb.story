Luis Suarez was mobbed by fans as he took a stroll through Barcelona with wife Sofia Balbi on Saturday.

The frontman, who joined the Catalan giants from Liverpool in a £75million deal, had a smile on his face as kids and grown-ups alike attempted to get photos with the Uruguay international.

The former Reds star was pictured signing one supporter's Lionel Messi shirt - Suarez will partner the Argentine talisman in attack at the Nou Camp next season.

While a number of Barcelona fans got a close look at their new signing, Suarez cannot be officially unveiled by his new club under the terms of his four-month ban from all football activity following his bite on Italy's Giorgio Chiellini during Uruguay's final World Cup group game in Brazil.

However Suarez is not short of admirers in the Spanish city as he adjusts to life in Barcelona before making his debut for the Catalan giants at the end of October.

Having lost out on the Premier League title with Liverpool late last season, Suarez will hope his move to Spain will bring success.

Brendan Rodgers' side looked set for their first title in 24 years but were pipped to the top of the table by Manchester City who finished two points above the Merseysiders.
