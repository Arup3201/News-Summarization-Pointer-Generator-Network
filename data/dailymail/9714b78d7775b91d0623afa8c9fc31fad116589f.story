It’s every girl’s dream to look beautiful on her wedding day.

But a botched nose job left one woman feeling ‘more like a boxer than a bride’ - and considering cancelling her big day entirely.

Clare Morgan, 34, from Liverpool, nicknamed 'Big Bird' by school bullies had her first nose job at the age of 25.

But when the operation went wrong, she was left with a nose that she said looked 'worse than before'. 

After being bullied for her nose (left) Clare Morgan, 34, from Liverpool underwent four nose jobs to achieve the look she wanted for her wedding day (right) 

A non-surgical nose filler treatment she found online 16 weeks before her wedding day finally restored her confidence and allowed her to walk down the aisle to marry her partner, Ryan, with pride 

Two correction surgeries  failed, leaving her nose too weak for further operations.

But when her boyfriend Ryan proposed, and the couple set a date for their wedding, Mrs Morgan's anxieties took over.

She contemplated banning cameras, or cancelling their big day altogether. 

After researching treatments on the internet, Mrs Morgan discovered a non-surgical nose job 16 weeks before her wedding day. 

It restored the shape she wanted and gave her the confidence to walk down the aisle.

Mrs Morgan said: ‘There was no way I could have married with my nose the way it was. It looked awful and I was far too self-conscious about it. 

‘I felt I looked like a boxer with an odd shaped nose after too many fights. 

‘At one point I thought I would have to cancel the wedding but thank goodness the new surgery worked and my nose looked normal again just in time. 

‘It’s taken four procedures but I’m finally happy with the way it looks.’ 

Mrs Morgan’s confidence was left left shattered after years of childhood bullying, her peers targeting her nose.

Nicknamed ‘Big Bird’ after the character in Sesame Street, she avoided being pictured side on and longed for the day she could afford cosmetic surgery. 

Before her first nose job, a surgeon showed Mrs Morgan a photoshopped image of what her nose would look like after the operation (left) - but the reality was so different it left her wanting to cancel her wedding (right)

A month after her first nose job, Mrs Morgan was not happy with the result and underwent a further two corrective surgeries and eventually a non-surgical filler treatment

When she was 25 she gained access to some inheritance held in trust since she was eight.

At £3,500 it was just enough for a nose job. 

In March 2005, she met a surgeon who agreed to straighten the nose and remove the bump.

She was shown a Photoshopped image of how she would look post-surgery and loved the result. 

She underwent the procedure in May 2005 but it was another two weeks before she got to see her new nose.

Mrs Morgan said that after her first nose job and two failed corrective procedures her nose looked like a 'plastic comedy one'

But when she finally looked in a mirror, it was a shock.

Despite hating what she saw, her surgeon assured her it would settle in time. However, a month later Mrs Morgan noticed the bridge of her nose was getting wider.

By March 2006, her surgeon confirmed that the bone down the centre of her nose hadn’t fused properly and was in fact separating. 

He offered to perform corrective surgery, but once again Mrs Morgan was left feeling disappointed with the results.

Her nose looked worse than before, despite the corrective surgery.

She said: ‘I couldn’t see any improvement to the bridge and the tip and nostrils looked strangely pointed. 

‘I knew it looked worse than it had before and my confidence plummeted.’

To make herself feel better she agreed to a holiday with friends.

It was there she met her future husband Ryan. 

She said: ‘I immediately told him I’d had surgery that had gone wrong and wanted to get it sorted. He told me I looked great but I knew I wouldn’t be happy unless it was fixed.’

After returning, her surgeon agreed to break and resent her nose for a second time. Two weeks later she was horrified to see the bridge now appeared too small for the tip.

Furious, she parted ways with the surgeon and instead went to her GP, but after three failed operations he warned her it was unlikely she would find anyone willing to operate. 

Mrs Morgan then had no choice but to resort to using make up techniques to try and disguise her nose. 

She said: ‘I tried to focus on my future and forget about it but it still affected my confidence every day and I avoided cameras as much as I could.’ 

In 2010, her partner proposed and soon after the couple had their first baby, a son James. 

After James’ birth the couple decided to set a date for the wedding, and decided on the August 12, 2012.

Initially Mrs Morgan was excited.

But that excitement turned to dread when she started thinking about the photographs, and all the guests seeing the nose that she hated. 

She said: ‘It was only after I had booked a venue and paid the deposit that I started thinking about wedding photography. 

‘I started to panic about my nose and trying to think of ways around the problem.’ 

She even considered banning cameras from the wedding. 

She said: ‘I thought if we could just have the professional photographer than then there was no risk of anyone taking a side profile picture of me. 

‘I knew I’d sound awful and ridiculous though. I even considered photo-shopping all the wedding pictures or cancelling it all together.’ 

But while researching botched nose jobs online she stumbled across a new treatment that reshaped noses using fillers – without needing surgery. 

There was one problem, the clinic was in LA. So Mrs Morgan started searching for a clinic in the UK and found a company that offered the treatment. 

With just 16 weeks before her big day she contacted Transform, and saw a consultant. 

He agreed her nose job was the worst he had ever seen, but was confident that he could use an injectable solution to restore the shape before the wedding. 

Despite anxieties about her nose leading her to consider cancelling her big day,  Mrs Morgan said she felt 'amazing' in her dress and actually enjoyed being photographed on her wedding day

After the first round of fillers she burst into tears of joy.

‘I finally looked like I had a normal nose. It was how I wanted to look after the first operation all those years back.’ she said. 

Two weeks later, after another procedure, she was ready for her big day.

For the first time in years, she enjoyed being photographed.

She said: ‘I felt amazing in my dress. As the photographer clicked away I enjoyed every minute. 

‘I felt like a real bride and not a boxer.’ 

Mrs Morgan is now due to have another round of fillers and has decided to share her story to make others aware this type of non-surgical treatment is available.

She said: ‘If only I’d known about it before I wouldn’t have wasted so many years hating my appearance.’
