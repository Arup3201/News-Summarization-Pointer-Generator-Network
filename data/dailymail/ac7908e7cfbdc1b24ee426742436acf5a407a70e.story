A crazy golf course has sparked controversy by featuring a model Adolf Hitler which gives a Nazi salute whenever a player hits a shot on target.

Visitors to the Grundy art gallery in Blackpool have been left stunned at the brown-shirted statue which raises its right arm and shrieks 'No, No, No,' every time a ball passes underneath.

The Hitler obstacle, which was created by visual artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, is part of a playable nine-hole crazy golf installation with each hole designed by a different artist.

It was unveiled to the public on Saturday and a spokesman for the Gallery said it has received a great reception.

He said: 'Everyone who has seen it has thought it was great fun and has enjoyed playing on it.

'When we were thinking about installing it we contacted the local ex-servicemen's committee because we were concerned about causing any offence.

'They said they were happy if we went ahead with it and we haven't received any complaints.'

The installation aims to show off various parts of Britain's political history and culture. One hole features a builder's bum while another depicts a library.

Among the other obstacles is a statue of Saddam Hussein which topples over when a ball drops into the hole.     

One visitor, six-year-old Kai Nouteboom, was given a fright when the Hitler statue yelled at him.

He told the Sun newspaper: 'It frightened me. I didn’t expect that to happen.'
