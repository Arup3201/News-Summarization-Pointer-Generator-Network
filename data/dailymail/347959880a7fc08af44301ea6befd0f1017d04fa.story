Alex Song retired from international duty this month but there was a Cameroonian feel to his choice of footwear, as he paid homage to cousin and former Cameroon star, Rigobert Song. 

Alex wore a pair of limited edition Puma King boots, one red and one yellow, just like Rigobert at the 1998 World Cup in France. There is another link between them too — Rigobert played for West Ham between 2000-2002.

West Ham were wearing their limited edition purple, gold and black third kit. ‘It has already proven a huge hit with supporters and you’ll need to act quickly to get your hands on one — with only around 2,000 of 4,000 still available to buy,’ was the warning in the match programme. The £49.99 replica strip went on sale in the summer and the first half have taken six months to sell.

Romelu Lukaku has enjoyed himself against West Ham in the past and his rich vein of form continued against Sam Allardyce’s side on Tuesday evening. 

Ahead of kick-off the Everton striker had scored in all four of his matches against West Ham, including the equaliser in the last match at Goodison Park to force the replay. And he made it five from five with a close-range finish to put Everton 2-1 up in extra-time before Carlton Cole’s late goal.

Roy Hodgson was at Upton Park and there were plenty of England internationals and potential call-ups on display. 

Seven of West Ham’s starting XI were English and five of Everton’s. The Hammers trio of Carl Jenkinson, Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll have all played for the national team under Hodgson, as have Everton’s Phil Jagielka, John Stones, Leighton Baines and Ross Barkley
