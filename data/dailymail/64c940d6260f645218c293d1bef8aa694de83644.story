Nicky Henderson believes Sprinter Sacre’s comeback second behind Dodging Bullets at Ascot on Saturday has left the gelding with a ‘realistic’ chance of winning back his Queen Mother Champion Chase crown at the Cheltenham Festival on March 11.

The Lambourn trainer, who felt the exacting pace in the Clarence House Chase set by eventual fourth Somersby ultimately took its toll on a gelding racing for the first time in 13 months, also insists he is not unduly concerned by the ‘low level bleed’ detected from the nine-year-old’s nostrils under veterinary examination while being routinely tested in the immediate aftermath of the race.

Henderson said: ‘We could do without it but it is something we can live with. If you looked at him this morning you would not see anything or know it had happened.

‘There was no mucus, which was important.’

Sprinter Sacre, who has recuperated from a heart problem, now heads straight to the Festival as 3-1 joint favourite for the Champion Chase with sponsors Betway, bracketed with recuperating reigning champion Sire De Grugy who is due to make his return to action in the Game Spirit Chase at Newbury on February 7.

Henderson added: ‘If you look at the time of the race it confirms AP (McCoy on Somersby) went a really good gallop. There was no hiding place and no chance of having a breather even for a few strides.

Nicky Henderson is confident Sprinter Sacre has nearly fully recovered from heart problem

‘There was that moment turning in when you just thought a miracle was going to happen but his legs turned to jelly. He's had a fairly intense build-up, which is why he was more than 80 per cent fit. He was probably nearer 90 per cent. I think it's realistic for him to regain his crown at Cheltenham.’

Meanwhile, Henderson’s 2011 Cheltenham Gold Cup winner Long Run has been ruled out for the season after injuries sustained in the spring.

Trainer Willie Mullins blamed a ‘little muscle problem’ for the defeat of Vautour at Christmas as the Supreme Novices’ Hurdle winner got back on the successful chasing trail with a bloodless victory at Leopardstown.

Ted Walsh-trained Boylesport Chase winner Foxrock could return to the track for the Irish Hennessy Gold Cup on February 8 while the feature Boylesport Hurdle was won by Katie T, trained by Kevin Prendergast and ridden by British-based Brian Hughes.
