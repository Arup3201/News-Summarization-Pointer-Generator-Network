Among the 250 ball people working at this year’s U.S. Open, one stands out from the rest.

Though Ryan McIntosh, a 23-year-old Afghan war veteran, volleys tennis balls like his compatriots, there is a conspicuous difference.

The young father had his leg blown off in combat, and now relies on a carbon-fibre prosthesis to dash across the courts.

Speaking with the New York Daily News, the former Army soldier said he didn’t want to be treated any differently. 

‘I don’t look at myself as being disabled or handicapped or anything else,’ adding: ‘I want to experience everything and live life to the fullest.’

Mr McIntosh was serving in Afghanistan in 2010 when he stepped on a landmine outside of Kandahar.

His right foot was immediately blown off, and was flown to a medical base, where he lost the rest of his leg up to his knee.

Later, the soldier was fitted with his prosthesis, not unlike those used by Olympic sprinter Oscar Pistorius.

He told the News that athletics were always part of his life. Mr McIntosh grew up outside of Aspen, Colorado, and had plans of playing sports in college.

Instead, he joined the Army, and was deployed to Afghanistan in October of 2010. 

Throughout the ordeal, he has learned to take things in stride. ‘It’s upsetting that I lost my leg,’ he told the News, ‘but I try to look it as a door opening, because it’s given me opportunities that I wouldn’t have had.’

Mr McIntosh has larger inspirations. For one, he hopes to meet Pistorius. For another, he wants to compete in the 2016 Paraolympics in Brazil. 

He lives with his wife Hannah and their 16-month-old son Kaden in Ft. Sam Houston, Texas. They’re expecting a second child.
