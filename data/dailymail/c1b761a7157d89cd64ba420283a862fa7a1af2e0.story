It's not often that football can dominate the sport headlines in the United States, but it's even rarer for it to take over the front pages.

For a country that is often more fixated on basketball and American football, it was 'soccer' that captured the nation - and USA's thrilling opening game World Cup victory over Ghana on Monday.

The New York Post dedicated their whole 
front page to the Group G victory, showing two fans who watched the 
action in Brazil and claiming how the win sparked celebration.

The Chicago Sun-Times led a similar fan tribute, focused on local residents who watched the game in Grant Park.

Clint Dempsey's first minute opener was the lead picture in the Boston Metro, who revelled on US pouncing late on to steal three points, and the former Fulham and Tottenham forward's opener also made the front page of the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

It was John Brooks who scored the winner
 and the celebrations after his header four minutes from time helped 
lead the front page on the Washington Times and USA Today.

USA's win over Ghana gives them real hope of progressing from Group G, with their match against Portugal on Sunday holding the key as to whether they can book an unlikely spot in the last 16 over Cristiano Ronaldo and Co.
