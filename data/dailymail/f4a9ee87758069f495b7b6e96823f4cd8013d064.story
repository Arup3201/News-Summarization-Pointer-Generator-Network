Jon Flanagan has revealed he is in negotiations over signing a new contract at Liverpool.

The 21-year-old established himself in the Reds defence last season but has missed this campaign's opening games with a problem of fluid on his knee. 

'There have been some talks and I should be signing a new contract soon,' Flanagan told the Liverpool ECHO.

'It would be reward for all the hard work I've put in. It would be great for me and great for my family as well.

'All I've ever wanted is to play for Liverpool and I want to stay here for as long as I possibly can.'

The local defender, whose current deal expires at the end of the season,is expected to return to fitness for the home game against Aston Villa following the international break.

He returned home from the club's pre-season tour of the United States - along with Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana -  after suffering problems with his knee. 

'I've been struggling with fluid in my left knee,' he explained.

'I just felt it during the tour and it's been a bit inflamed.

'It's just something we have to be careful with.

On the mend: The 21-year-old has not played this campaign after suffering a knee problem in pre-season

'I want to be back out there but I can't rush it. I need to make sure that when I do come back I'm 100%.

'I don't think I'll be back for this weekend but I'm hoping to be fit for the Villa game.

'The next couple of weeks should give me the chance to get back into full training and build up my fitness.'
