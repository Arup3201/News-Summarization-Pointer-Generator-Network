Jermain Defoe admits he will be judged on his goals return after signing for Sunderland in time to make his debut at former club Spurs on Saturday.

The 32-year-old has penned a three-and-a-half-year deal at the Stadium of Light having been convinced to head to the north-east by former Tottenham coach Gus Poyet, who he played under at White Hart Lane.

Sunderland are the Premier League’s second-lowest scorers with just 18, and there is pressure on Defoe to hit the ground running given their struggles in front of goal.

Defoe will want to continue his record of scoring a goal on debut for each of his Premier League clubs 

The striker has signed on a three-year deal from Toronto with Jozy Altidore moving in the other direction

‘As a forward, you get judged on scoring goals,’ said the ex-England striker.

‘When you have set high standards of scoring goals over your career, people expect goals. Hopefully I can play as many games as I can and get the chances, and I believe if I get the chances I will score goals.’

Defoe, who has quit the MLS after one season with Toronto FC, added: ‘I’m happy to be here. I’m delighted. I’m just looking forward to the challenge. I remember a few years back, at some stage, I thought something was going to happen.

‘It’s a great club and I’ve always enjoyed coming up here and playing against Sunderland because of the stadium and the fans. It’s a great place to play football. I’m looking forward to it.’

He went on: ‘It was good over in Toronto, I enjoyed it. But for me, the Premier League is the best league in the world and when you step away from it, you realise how good it is. To be honest, I just missed it. I wanted to come back and be back in the Premier League scoring goals.’

As part of Defoe's deal  Jozy Altidore - who failed to score a goal this season - will move in the opposite direction. 

Poyet said: 'I am thrilled that Jermain is a Sunderland player. I know all about his attributes and his qualities first-hand and his exceptional goal-scoring record speaks for itself. He has something different, something special.

'We know each other very well - he was very young when we played together and I was coming to the end of my career, so I know him from inside the pitch.

'When I returned to Spurs as a coach, it was a great experience for me to work with him, so I am really looking forward to having him as my player now and for him to be part of our team.

'I would also like to thank Jozy as his begins his career at his new club. It is a fresh start for him and we wish him well.'

The Black Cats managed to beat off competition from a series of Barclays Premier League rivals, including Crystal Palace and QPR, to acquire Defoe's services, and sporting director Lee Congerton was thrilled to see his hard work finally come to fruition.

Congerton said: 'Jermain is a player who has proven his quality in the Premier League. Naturally, with a player of his calibre, there was a lot of interest in him, not only in England but across Europe, so we are delighted that he has chosen to come to Sunderland.'

Altidore, who joined the club from AZ Alkmaar during the summer of 2013, managed just three goals in 52 appearances in all competitions, and only one in 42 in the league.
