With their silver hair and kind smiles, Christine Smith, Sheila Henderson and June Senior look like three normal grandmothers, enjoying a quiet drink and a chat.

But their innocent looks bely a wilder reality and when the trio, who are aged between 61 and 64, travel abroad on one of their regular grannies’ trips, all thoughts of a quiet life are left behind.

Instead of enjoying quiet days out with their grandchildren, fancy dress, colourful cocktails and Spanish party spots are the order of the day for the three Barnsley pensioners.

Dressing up: Fancy dress is a favourite with all three grannies who often dress as pop stars

Indeed, June, a former barmaid, has been dubbed 'the tearaway' by her friends thanks to her penchant for zipping between bars, cleavage proudly on show, on her mobility scooter.

Now the trio are to appear on a new documentary called OAPs Behaving Badly, a Channel 5 series that follows the nation’s craziest pensioners.

The trio's party plans swung into action as soon as they retired, with Christine and Sheila joining June in Tenerife for a huge party to mark her retirement.

The riotous trip to the Spanish holiday island included nights out wearing comedy wigs and boobs, plastic penis noses, and flirtations with much younger male holidaymakers.

'On holiday no man is ever safe because I can guarantee I always feel somebody’s bottom or something else,' explained Christine, a grandmother of three.

;My behaviour is a bit erotic sometimes. If I’ve had a drink especially.'

But husband Tony, 67, doesn’t mind being left behind or his wife’s flirty behaviour and indulges in several solo weeks in Spain himself.

According to Christine, ‘What happens in Tenerife, stay in Tenerife’, with all three ladies happy to make the most of their time abroad.

'When I went to Tenerife for my son’s 40th I got dressed up as a hooker,' reveals Christine, admitting she got into trouble with a local woman, who thought she was a rival escort invading her patch. 

Leading the charge: Christine is the ringleader and says 'no man is safe' when she is out and about

Propping up the bar: The trio have long been fans of wild all-night parties

Apologies: June says the trio often have to apologise when they return to bars following a booze-fuelled night

Just as excitable is June who rides a mobility scooter as a result of having had 10 leg operations. Not that she has any plans to slow down.

'When she gets on that scooter, you’ve got to watch out because you’re never safe,' says Christine. 'She can be a tearaway when she gets speeding on that scooter.'

But despite her tearaway nickname, June says Christine is the wildest of the group. 'Once we’ve been somewhere, we’re never forgotten. 

'We go back for the second time and we have to apologise for what Christine’s done the first time.'
