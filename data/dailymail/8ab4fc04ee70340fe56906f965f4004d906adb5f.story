If you're a teenager who really can’t wait until you hit the age of 17 to start driving, this could be just the ticket - but let's just hope your parents have got deep pockets.

The Aixam Coupe S looks like a compact city car but is in fact a ‘light quadricycle’ which can be driven with a moped licence from the age of 16 - and it comes with a hefty price tag of £9,999.

The insurance on the two-seater vehicle will also cost the average 16-year-old £2,200 per year, based on an average mileage of 5,000 miles and no accidents or convictions.

The vehicle, which is powered by a Kubota 400cc diesel engine and comes with 12 months of free road tax, has alloy wheels and many typical features found in a car - including a CD player.

To qualify as a quadricycle, the vehicle, which has two white stripes on the bonnet, had to weigh less than 350kg and have a power output not exceeding 4kw - with a maximum speed of 30mph.

Engineers fitted the Coupe S, which has a top speed of 28mph, with a diesel engine that is capable of 79.4 miles per gallon while emitting 77 grams per kilometre of carbon dioxide.

The vehicle, which is being billed as a safer alternative to a moped, will be launched in the UK at the Motorcycle Live event from November 24 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham.

Aixam, a French manufacturer based in Aix-les-Bains, Savoie, plans to sell the vehicle at motorcycle dealerships in the UK after it was launched at the Paris Motor Show in September and October.

Justin Bond, Aixam’s UK manager, said: ‘We believe that the young rider market for scooters and mopeds has been contracting lately due to the difficulty in convincing parents of the safety issues surrounding mopeds and scooters. This will offer a safer method of transport to this demographic.’

A spokesman for specialist insurance broker Bikesure gave the average figure of £2,200 for 16-year-olds to insure the car, which he said was ‘in the same ballpark to a 17-year-old driving a small standard car’.

But the vehicle is even more expensive than the 2013 version of the UK's most popular car, the Ford Fiesta, which is coming to the market at £9,795.
