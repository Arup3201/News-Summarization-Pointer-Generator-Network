Dead: Alberto Morales, 42, pictured, was killed around 12:25 a.m. Saturday near Grapevine Lake in North Texas after police responded to a burglary call and found the man hiding in woods nearby

A Florida fugitive who escaped custody after he stabbed a police officer in the neck with his glasses was shot dead today.

Alberto Morales, 42, was killed around 12:25 a.m. near Grapevine in North Texas after police responded to a burglary call and found the man hiding in woods nearby.

A Grapevine Police officer and two US Marshalls Fugitive Task Force Members shot Morales as they tried to arrest him.

'With the use of the helicopter and the infrared capability of the helicopter, they were able to identify someone in the woods not far from where the house was burglarized,' Sergeant Robert Eberling, told NBC News.

'Officers and members of the US Marshalls Fugitive Task Force responded to that area. They encountered Mr. Morales. He was shot and he is now deceased.'

Erbling didn't say whether Morales' actions provoked the officers to open fire. He said the matter was being investigated.

The Southlake DPS Facebook page first tweeted the information shortly after 1 a.m. By 3:25 a.m., police had not moved Morales' body, NBC reported.

On Thursday, federal agents went door-to-door in the neighborhoods near the Grapevine Wal-Mart, where Morales made his brazen escape.

They talked to homeowners and searched barns and sheds in the area, warning that the man, who had been convicted of sexual assault, was armed and dangerous.

He is believed to have stolen men's 
clothing and jewelery from the home on Friday night. Morales was still 
wearing part of his prison-issued jumpsuit as well as jogging pants, 
according to CBS News.

The fugitive's escape from custody sparked a widespread five-day manhunt in North Texas.

The
prisoner, who was convicted in two violent sexual assaults, stabbed one
of two police escorts and escaped in the Dallas area as he was being 
transferred from Florida to Nevada, police said on Tuesday.

Morales
stabbed one of the officers once in the neck and three times in the 
back with a sharp part of his eyeglasses on Monday night outside a 
Wal-Mart in Grapevine.  

Miami-Dade Police Detective Jaime 
Pardinas, a 54-year-old who has been on the force for 28 years, is in 
serious but stable condition, authorities said.

He
is being treated at a Dallas hospital for deep stab wounds to the neck,
shoulder and back and a collapsed lung. It's not clear when he would be
released.

Pardinas
and Detective David Carrero were scheduled to fly to Nevada with 
Morales so he could serve two life sentences there for aggravated sexual
assault. But the officers and Morales weren't allowed to get back on 
the plane during a layover in Texas because of the inmate's erratic 
behavior, authorities said.

During the first leg of the flight, Morales was 'bumping his head against a passenger seat in front of him, so he was doing a lot of crazy, unusual things that just disrupted the entire flight,' said Miami-Dade Police Director J.D. Patterson Jr.

The detectives were then forced to rent a vehicle at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport with the intention of driving the nearly 1,200 miles to their destination. Miami Police said there are clear policies about transporting inmates across state lines, but didn't discuss details other than to say two officers must be present.

The officers stopped to use the restroom at the store late on Monday night and were waiting for a third officer to meet them and assist with the rest of the trip. While Carrero was inside the store, Morales got hold of the broken pair of eyeglasses, stabbed Pardinas and fled, authorities said.

'He was handcuffed. We don't know how he got the handcuffs free,' Patterson said. 

It's unclear if Morales' hands were cuffed in front or behind him or if he was shackled. Miami police also declined to speculate on how Cuban-born Morales obtained the object he used to stab the officer.

Morales was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December in Miami after pleading guilty to sexual battery with a deadly weapon, burglary with assault and kidnapping stemming from a 2003 crime. He was being taken to Nevada to serve out life sentences on a separate sexual assault conviction in that state. 

Authorities frequently fly inmates across the country and said they are occasionally forced off the plane by an inmate's behavior.

'The airlines are picky,' said Miami-Dade Police Deputy Director Juan Perez, who noted airlines will ask officers escorting inmates to leave for minor things because they are worried about liability issues.
