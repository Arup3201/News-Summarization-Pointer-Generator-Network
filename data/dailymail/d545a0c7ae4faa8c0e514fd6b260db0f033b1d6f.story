Victim: Kalinka Bamberski is seen in this undated family photo. Dieter Krombach, a German doctor and the stepfather of Kalinka, has been jailed for 15 years for killing her

A German doctor has been sentenced to
15 years in prison for killing his teenage stepdaughter after he was 
kidnapped and smuggled into France to face justice.

Dieter
Krombach, 76, was found guilty by a French court on Saturday for 
unintentionally killing Kalinka Bamberski in Bavaria in 1982.

It
followed a three-week trial which only came about after the victim's 
natural father, Andre Bamberski, hired a team of Russian kidnappers to 
take Krombach from Germany to France to face a court.

The bizarre case has divided French and German investigators. 

In 1995, Krombach, a cardiologist, was found guilty of manslaughter by a French court in absentia while living in Bavaria.

German
investigators had ruled in 1987 that there was insufficient evidence to
charge Krombach and extradition to France was refused.

Krombach thought he would be safe in his home in Germany.

But
Mr Bamberski, 74, waged a relentless campaign to bring the ageing 
suspect before a French court and went to extreme lengths by hiring a 
team of professional Russian kidnappers.

Two years ago the medic was bundled into the back of a blacked-out limousine car, bound and gagged, and driven to France.

After
being hauled out of the back of a limousine by the Russian kidnappers, 
Mr Krombach was found tied and gagged next to a court building in 
Mulhouse, the French city on the German border.

French law allowed him to be retried before a judge.

Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, Mr Bamberski told how he was delighted with the verdict.

'My
first thought is for Kalinka,' he said. 'What I promised her, what I 
wanted was a complete and fair trial. Now that goal has been reached. 
Justice has been done in her memory and now I will be able to mourn for 
her.'

Mr Bamberski, who is French, now faces kidnapping charges for Krombach's abduction.

The
retired accountant has admitted organising the abduction of his 
daughter's killer but denies paying any money to abductors. He says it 
was justified because Krombach would otherwise have escaped justice.

His daughter died in 1982 aged 14 while on holiday with her mother near Lake Constance in southern Germany.

Prosecution
counsel Pierre Kramer said Krombach raped the French teenager after 
drugging her, inadvertently causing her death when she suffocated in her
sleep.

Krombach claimed he had given her an iron injection to help improve her suntan.

An initial autopsy report pointed to signs of injury to her genitals, but subsequent tests were rendered inconclusive.

Suspicious white and red fluids were also found on Kalinka's underwear and legs. 

According
to the Daily Telegraph, Kalinka's mother Danielle Gonnin, told the 
court that she had found her daughter lifeless in bed.

'I
immediately thought of the injection, but Dieter Krombach told me: "No,
there's never been any problem with these injections.'

The court in Paris said on Saturday that Krombach was guilty of 'wilful violence leading to death without intent'.

In
1997 - in a completely separate case - he was convicted of drugging and
raping a 16-year-old patient and received a two-year suspended prison 
sentence.          

Krombach's
attorneys had said the French trial was illegal and argued the case 
should be heard by the European Court of Human Rights. They said they 
would appeal against the latest court decision.

A
legal observer from Germany went to the Paris trial.

The country has 
made it clear that it disapproves of both the kidnapping and retrial.
