Eric Pickles yesterday defended the intelligence services over the Woolwich terror attack, saying it is impossible to control everyone all the time.

The Communities Secretary said: ‘We need to be realistic that a free and open society is always vulnerable.’

However, he made clear that David Cameron is demanding to know ‘what went wrong’ after it emerged that the two suspected terrorists were known to MI5.

Questions: Police and security services have faced criticism over what they knew about the suspected killers of Drummer Lee Rigby

Balance: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said there were limits to intelligence controls in a free society while Richard Barrett, ex-head of counter-terrorism at MI6, said preventing attacks was incredibly hard

Government sources have revealed both suspects – Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale – appeared on lists of interest to the security services.

Mr Pickles told the BBC: ‘Peers and MPs will do a thorough investigation in terms of what the security forces knew but I’ve seen experts on security explaining how difficult it is in a free society to be able to control everyone.’

He added: ‘The Prime Minister is very clear he wants to see an investigation about what went right and what went wrong.

‘It’s very important to stress these investigation are still going on.’

Victim: Lee Rigby, 25, was yesterday named as the victim of the Woolwich knife attack

Mr Pickles did not rule out new government action to demand tougher laws to combat terrorism.

But he stopped short of backing a reintroduction of the so-called 
Snooper’s Charter, which would give the security services the right to 
access to data relating to citizens internet, email and phone traffic.

The Bill was dropped from the Queen’s Speech following opposition from the Liberal Democrats.

Mr Pickles said: ‘I know of nothing that would suggest that provisions that were in that bill would have made any difference in this case or would have saved the life of the young member of the armed forces.

‘I think it’s probably too soon to assess the powers we need but once the investigation is through, both aspects of the security services and aspects of the policing of these two individuals will be thoroughly investigated and no doubt recommendations will come out of that.’
