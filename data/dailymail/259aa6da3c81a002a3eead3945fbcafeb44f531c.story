The issue of how best to balance a film's accuracy with its entertainment value has long vexed Hollywood executives.

And  it now appears to have ruffled feathers at the British Museum after the latest Ben Stiller film shot on site featured a number of scenes curators are concerned could mislead  visitors.

British Museum staff treated to an advanced screening of Night at the Museum 3: The Secret of the Tomb were aghast when a scene showed its characters fleeing from lava during the eruption of Pompeii.

The audience let out an audible gasp, with one woman screeching: 'There was no lava at Pompeii - Vesuvius erupted with a pyroclastic flow', The Times reported.

The ancient Roman town was buried in the deadly explosion not by lava, but ash and pumice.

British Museum staff have now provided an information guide to rectify some points the film portrays for the purposes of entertainment, but which have little basis in reality.

Sian Toogood, the musesum's broadcast manager, told The Times curators instinctively disliked inaccuracies, but she was hoping the film would draw in new visitors despite a few liberties being taken.

She said: 'We don't have a model of Pompeii at all, so it's kind of moot what kind of eruption it has. We're really hoping that it will encourage people who might not normally come to the museum.

'But if they want dinosaurs they should go to the Natural History Museum.'

While much of the film does portray real exhibits - albeit ones which come to life - other inaccuracies include an impressive but entirely fictional triceratops skeleton.

Filmmakers were obviously building on the popularity of the previous films' tyrannosaurus rex character when they added it into the script.

In reality, the British Museum holds no dinosaur skeletons - they are all located at the Natural History Museum.

Not planning to adhere to the strict rules of accuracy like that of its subject matter, Night at the Museum 3: Secret of the Tomb has taken a few liberties which may mislead those planning a visit to the British Museum.

The museum doesn't hold a triceratops skeleton. In fact, it contains no dinosaur skeletons as complete or impressive as the foreboding monster Ben Stiller's character faces.

In the film, two beautifully glazed porcelain ornaments, known as the Kakiemon elephants from 17th Century Japan, are portrayed as the size of real elephants. In reality, they are only 14inches tall.

Although the museum boasts an incredible 120 human mummies, it does not hold the Egyptian pharaoh Ahkmenrah's tomb  as scenes from the film would suggest.

British Museum directors have also been forced to remind visitors that it does not hold a 'nine-headed demon snake cast in bronze'. The monster was a feature of Chinese mythology but the museum hold such object.

Medieval period enthusiasts will be disappointed to hear that the museum holds nothing that could be attributed to Sir Lancelot - who the curators gently remind is a fictional character - after he makes an appearance in the film.

Nor does it have a 'medieval gallery' through which Ben Stiller's character is chased by the museum's fictional triceratops.
