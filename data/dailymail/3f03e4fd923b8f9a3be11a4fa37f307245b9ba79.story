The monthly cost of a run-of-the-mill affair is $444, according to a new survey, and if it runs for the average lifespan of six months, that's $2,664 by the time it fizzles out.

VoucherCloud's study polled 2,645 American married couples over the age of 25, and calculated the cost by assessing the hotel bills, dinner tabs and gifts associated with the illicit affairs reported.

Of those questioned, nearly a quarter admitted to having cheated on their spouses; with affairs generally unfolding two years into the marriage. And only a third of those cheaters said their spouses had noticed a shift in the family's finances as a result of their pricey trysts.

The most pricey extravagance on the list
 was the dinner and drinks tabs, averaging about $162 a month, followed by 
hotel bills, at $123 a month. Date activities, including cinema tickets 
for example, cost $69 a month, and gifts accounted for $54. 
Miscellaneous expenses added up to $36, rounding out the total monthly cost of $444.

Of course, expenses can run a lot higher. Ramani Durvasula, a licensed clinical psychologist based in Santa Monica, California, told Today.com: 'Secret cell phones, airline tickets, secret credit cards, hotel rooms -  the costs can be astronomical.'

Iconic model Christie Brinkley, now 60, was one cheating-victim who learned this the hard way. In 2008, it was revealed that her then-husband Peter Cook, an architect, was conducting an affair with an 18-year-old store-clerk, Diana Bianchi.

Mr Cook was busted for showering Miss Bianchi with gifts; including a $2,000 watch, lingerie from Victoria’s Secret, a $15,000 down payment for a car, and an ultimately fruitless fee of $300,000 to keep quiet about the affair.

Amid the world of mortals, sociologists have long been grappling with estimates for how common extra-marital affairs truly are, with results from various surveys indicating anywhere from 25per cent to 75per cent of married people admitting to being unfaithful. Admitting it being the key of course.

Dinner and drinks tabs: $162

Hotel bills: $123

Date activities, such as movie tickets: $69

Gifts: $54

Miscellaneous: $36

Total: $444

It is certainly much easier to cheat in today's world than it once was, with many experts pointing to the rise of social media and password-protected communication gadgets as culprits.

Then there are portals such as AshleyMadison.com, the world's largest cheating website, and the second large dating site overall after Match.com; boasting 26 million members worldwide.

AshleyMadison's slogan is 'Life is short. Have an affair,' and its members can log in to actively seek out cheating partners with whom to have affairs with.

Still, however expensive an affair may be, Psycholost Ms Durvasula says it can never match up to its emotional costs.

'The betrayal of trust is the largest cost of having an affair,' she said. 'The guilt, the loss of self-esteem, the loss of self-worth - good luck putting dollars and cents on that.'
