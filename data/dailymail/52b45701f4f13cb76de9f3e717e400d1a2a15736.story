An unlicensed driver who mowed down four cyclists, killing two, in New Hampshire has been sentenced to up to 40 years in prison for manslaughter and assault. 

Darriean Hess, 20, was high was on the powerful prescription painkiller fentanyl when she cross the center life and smashed into a cyclists on a charity bike ride in Seabrook, New Hampshire, in 2013. 

The wreck killed 60-year-old Pamela Wells and 52-year-old Elise Bouchard just after the start of the Granite State Wheelmen Tri-State Seacoast Century ride.

She barely spoke in court and stared down at the table as her victims' families - and one of the surviving cyclists - gave emotional testimony about the horror of her crime.

'You changed my world. The whole universe changed. Two of the kindest, most wonderful women were taken from all of us. The world is a darker place today,' Margo Heigh told Darriean Hess, according to WMUR-TV.

Wells left behind a husband and two teenage children. Bouchard was married. Her widower attended the sentencing on Monday.

Hess was a troubled teenager before smashing into the cyclists on a New Hampshire highway

Hess was a troubled 19-year-old when she smashed into the cyclists in September 2013. Her mother had recently tragically died and she dropped out of college to take care of her younger siblings before moving to Alaska and then back to New Hampshire. 

She was pulled out and given a speeding ticket just eight hours before the crash - but still took to the road despite not having a valid license.

The court room in Brentwood, New Hampshire, was packed with friends and family members of the victims - as well as Hess' family members.

Hess was sentenced to 15 to 40 years in prison - with seven to 14 years suspended. 

Some of the victims' relatives had advocated for a longer sentence because of the recklessness of the crime. 

Others said Hess should receive leniency and a second chance.
