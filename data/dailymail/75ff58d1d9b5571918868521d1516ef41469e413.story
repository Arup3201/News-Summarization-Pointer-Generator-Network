One in four children who try to get around parental controls on internet use are looking for pornography, research reveals.

The data lays bare the scale of the problem of freely available pornography, as campaigners call for a greater understanding of the damage it can have on children.

Web security firm Kaspersky said 23 per cent of searches its software blocked in the UK in the first five months of this year were for pornography.

The parent-installed software sends data to the company each time it blocks access to a malicious site if the customer has not opted out of supplying such information.

Of nearly 30,000 blocked searches, 23.3 per cent were for porn sites, 19.6 per cent for online stores and 16.1 per cent for social networking sites.

It also blocked online gaming sites (5.9 per cent), gambling sites (3.0 per cent) and information about weapons (2.9 per cent).

The research, also carried out by Kaspersky on its international customer base, recorded more than 25million attempts to access online porn globally in the last month alone.

Other subjects blocked included online gaming sites, gambling sites and information about weapons

The Mail is campaigning for internet providers to automatically block access to porn, with an optional opt-in, rather than parents having to rely on software such as Kaspersky to limit access.

At a debate organised by think tank the Policy Exchange in London yesterday, politicians and medical professionals discussed the increasing harm unbridled access to porn is having on teenagers.

John Woods, a consultant psychotherapist at the NHS Portman Clinic in London who treats young men and women addicted to porn, told the audience about a 16-year-old patient who sexually assaulted his younger next-door neighbour after becoming addicted to porn.

‘All day he was thinking about the imagery,’ he said. ‘He felt he was losing touch with reality. The relief only came when he switched his computer back on again.’

Gail Dines, professor of sociology and women’s studies at Wheelock College in Boston, said: ‘Asking a family to deal with the porn use of their child is like telling a mother that their children should not breathe in pollution.’
