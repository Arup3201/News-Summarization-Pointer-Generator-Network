A burglar begging a judge to send him to prison must be a rare sight in any court.

And in the case of housebreaker Kierran Batchelor, the reason  was equally unusual – his 10am meetings with his probation officer were wrecking his sleep patterns.

The 21-year-old had originally been handed a suspended 40-week sentence and supervision order after he burgled two houses in February.

The judge was prepared to give Kierran Batchelor a second chance, but he turned it down

But weeks after walking free from court he was back before a judge after missing his daily meetings with his probation officer.

Batchelor told the judge he failed to attend the meetings because they were too early in the day – despite being at 10am.

Recorder David Herbert told Batchelor he was willing to give him a second chance when he appeared at Coventry Crown Court on Friday.

But astonishingly, Batchelor was jailed after he asked to be sent to prison so he could catch up on his sleep.

Batchelor, who represented himself, was working 10pm-6am in a warehouse. He told Recorder Herbert: ‘I was not finishing work until 6am and had to be at probation at 10am. It wrecked my sleep pattern. It was getting too much. I’d rather go to jail and get it out the way, come out and get a fresh start, and not have to do probation and things like that.’

Mr Herbert asked Batchelor: ‘Have you given up on the order?’ He replied: ‘Yes.’

Matthew Barnes, prosecuting, told the court: ‘He has told me that he has insufficient motivation to attempt to comply with the order. He is resigned to the suspended sentence being imposed.’

Sentencing him to 40 weeks in prison, Recorder Herbert told Batchelor: ‘You have failed to co-operate with the requirements of the order. In those circumstances I am going to activate the 40-week sentence. You were given a chance and you have not taken it.’

Grinning Batchelor, from Coventry, even thanked the judge as he was being led away.

He was originally sentenced on April 20 after committing two burglaries in Coventry in February.

As well as the suspended sentence he was given six months of drug rehabilitation and 18 months’ supervision.

He later tested positive for cannabis and failed to attend any appointments after May 18.

The 39 days Batchelor spent on remand in March and April will count towards his sentence.

Kierran Batchelor took to Facebook to share his excitement at being released from remand after his initial sentencing on April 20. But he later told a judge that daily probation meetings were 'too much' and asked for prison instead
