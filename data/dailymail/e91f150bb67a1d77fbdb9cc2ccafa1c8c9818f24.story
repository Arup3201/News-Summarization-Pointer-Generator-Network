In a city famed for its beautiful people, you might think they would blend right in.

But when the world’s most beautiful women descended on Miami on Monday ahead the 2014 Miss Universe pageant, even the most hardened heads in Florida’s party capital were turning to have a look.

Nearly 90 contestants from around the world have landed in the little-known town of Dorel to compete in this year's competition.

The Miss Universe contestants are touring, filming, rehearsing and preparing to compete for the Miss Universe 2014 crown to be decided on 25 January 2015 in Miami. Here, Miss Universe India 2014, Noyonita Lodh, has her hair done by a stylist backstage

The preliminary competition, which includes evening gown, swimsuit and the interview rounds, will take place on Wednesday 21 January - but that doesn't mean the preparations haven't begun.

Women from dozens of countries - including Albania, El Salvador, Great Britain and Haiti - have been preparing backstage for the biggest week of their lives.

The event's official photographer followed the women, who are touring, filming, rehearsing and preparing to compete, and captured the lengthy preparation processes, from getting their haired coiffed to having dresses fitted.

In the photo series, the likes of Miss Hungary 2014, Henrietta Kelemen, can be seen getting her hair done while Miss Universe India 2014, Noyonita Lodh, slips into a dazzling sequin embellished dress.

Following on from the preliminary round, the top 15 women will be chosen and they will go straight into the National Costume round the same night.

The finals will be held at the FIU Arena on Sunday 25 January, when Venezuelan Miss Universe 2013, Gabriela Isler, will hand over her crown.

Donald J. Trump and Paula M. Shugart, president of the Miss Universe Organization, recently revealed that Today show host Natalie Morales and MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts will host the 63rd pageant, a three-hour show that airs on NBC. 

It has also been rumoured that Filipino boxer, Manny Pacquioa, will be a judge, although he is yet to confirm his place on the panel.

Among the notable contestants is Miss Great Britian, Grace Levy, an events executive from London. 

Grace, who studied psychology  in Bristol, worked as an event manager of her own annual charity event and starred on popular British dating show, Take Me Out.

Tegan, who is studying for a Bachelor of Nutritional Medicine, has hopes of raising awareness of mental health in youth. She is also part of a youth mentoring program helping schoolgirls struggling with confidence.

Miss USA, 24-year-old Nia Sanchez, is half Hispanic, and has travelled across the world on countless mission trips. 

After working as a full-time model for the past seven years, she landed a face character role at Hong Kong Disney World.

The popular contest was established in 1952 as a local 'bathing beauty' competition spearheaded by Catalina Swimwear in Long Beach, California. 

Speaking about the pageant, a spokesperson for the event said: 'These women are savvy, goal-oriented and aware. The delegates who become part of the Miss Universe Organization display those characteristics in their everyday lives, both as individuals, who compete with hope of advancing their careers, personal and humanitarian goals, and as women who seek to improve the lives of others.'

This year's event hasn't come without controversy; tensions are rife in the event's city of Doral, who pledged $2.5million from its reserves to support Trump’s beauty pageant, according to the Miami Herald.

Grace Levy, Miss Great Britain, recently revealed heR 'patriotic' national costume on her Facebook page

Alongside the image, she wrote: 'My national costume is the epitome of Great Britain, and mostly London where I live. 

'My costume portrays a sense of how I feel about being a modern day woman in my city; passionate, strong and empowered, whilst at the same time giving me the the opportunity to represent something which people immediately know as British.

'It also reflects the protection of the monarchy and how patriotic I feel towards them. 

'I spent days exploring my city to find inspiration and I discovered that London is a city which is completely dedicated to them; hence why I finally decided to base my national costume on the Royal Guards of Buckingham Palace. 

'My costume was designed by myself and handmade using the same textiles and embellishments from the same factory that make all official regalia for the royal family and their guards. 

'This has made my costume that little bit more special. The factory also happens to make the costumes for smash hit British TV series Game of Thrones. 

'I can't wait to represent the greatness of Britain on stage in Miami! To the people of GB..... This is for YOU.'

Fashion writer Simon Glazin (theverysimong.com) said: 'This, she says, shows how she feels about the Monarchy. Not a great deal, by the looks of it!

'How she thinks it is OK to parade on stage representing Great Britain, or in her words "the people of GB", in this get up is beyond me. It's sending up completely the wrong message.

'It looks more like a cheap, tacky tribute to Cheryl Cole with a dead animal on her head.

'There is nothing here that will protect the Monarchy. In fact, if I was the Queen, I'd make sure she's ousted from the country immediately.'
