Arsenal are due to watch Aleksandar Dragovic, the Austria international centre-back, play in a friendly for his club Dinamo Moscow during their warm weather training break in Marbella this week.

Dragovic is valued at £15m and seen as a potential back-up option to Gabriel Paulista should Arsenal fail to gain a work permit for the Villarreal defender. Manchester United and West Ham have also checked on 23-year-old Dragovic.

Brazilian Gabriel was left out of Villarreal's squad to face Levante on Saturday and said his farewells to teammates prior to the clubs agreeing a £15m deal.

Arsenal have included Joel Campbell on loan as part of the deal and will receive a £750,000 fee. Real Sociedad had also asked to take the Costa Rica striker. 

Villarreal confirmed the transfer news on Paulista and Campbell on their official Twitter account saying: 'The principle of agreement for the transfer of Gabriel with @Arsenal has been completed. He will say his goodbyes today before the party. good luck!

'Welcome @joel_campbell12 to Villarreal as Arsenal agree to loan the player until the end of the season!'

Work permit rules may yet prove to be an issue in the deal as Paulista is yet to play international football. But as Sportsmail revealed on Wednesday, Arsenal will appeal any decision not to give Paulista a permit this month in an attempt to land him now.
