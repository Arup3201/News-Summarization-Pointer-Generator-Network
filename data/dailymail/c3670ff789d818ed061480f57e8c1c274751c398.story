With BBQ season on the horizon, bell peppers are set to come into their own.

But slicing and dicing the colorful fruit for kebabs or salads can sometimes prove troublesome with hundreds of tiny seeds to wrestle with.

However, thanks to a new 'life hack' video from YouTube user Rumble Viral, a pepper is opened up in a matter of seconds without disrupting any of the pips.

First the pepper's top and bottoms are sliced off before the remaining body is cut through on one side.

So that no piece is wasted, the green stalk  is popped out of the top of the pepper with the chef pushing it through with his fingers.

To finish, the body of the pepper is cut into strips then the batons are turned the other way and diced into squares. 

The top and bottom parts of the pepper are chopped in a similar fashion. 

The whole process takes just under one minute.
