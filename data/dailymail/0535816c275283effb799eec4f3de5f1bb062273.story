A traffic warden has been sacked after he was caught using visitor permits to avoid a parking fine. 

Nicholas Brzezinski, 64, used the permits on his Nissan Primera while working as a parking warden in Portsmouth.

He was investigated  when Portsmouth City Council were tipped off that staff were abusing parking rules, and enforcement officers were sent to the LA North parking zone in Southsea to investigate.

Flouting the rules: Nicholas Brzezinski, 64, used visitor permits on his Nissan Primera while working as a parking warden in Portsmouth so he didn't get a parking ticket

Used his inside knowledge: Brzezinski was investigated when Portsmouth City Council were tipped off that staff were abusing parking rules, and enforcement officers were sent to investigate

When they arrived,they saw Brzezinski’s Nissan Primera parked there 
displaying a visitor permit, Portsmouth Magistrates’ Court, Hampshire, 
heard.

It
 was later discovered that on several occasions, he was dishonestly 
using a visitors parking permit when tasked with working as a parking 
warden.

When asked why he had flouted parking rules in Portsmouth, Hampshire, he said: 'So I wouldn’t get a parking ticket.'

Victoria Putnam, prosecuting, said: 'The defendant was a fully-trained, experienced civil enforcement officer who undoubtedly used his knowledge to take advantage of the parking restrictions.'

Brzezinski admitted four counts of using a device with intent to deceive between November last year and February.

Caught: Brzezinkski was caught out when enforcement officers were sent to the LA North parking zone in Southsea (one of the streets is pictured) to see if staff were parking their cars there

He admitted one count of possessing an item for use in connection with fraud.

Marie de Redman, defending, said: 'He knew he was breaching the terms of the permits.

'But he wasn’t trying to do so in such a way that he was trying to cheat anybody out of any money or gain anything for himself.'

The court heard the permits were lawfully obtained and that Brzezinski, from Portsmouth, had used them lawfully previously.

Brzezinkski, who was in the Merchant Navy and had been due to retire in February next year, has been dismissed from his job at the city council.

He is appealing the decision.

He was ordered to do 80 hours of unpaid work in the next year and told to pay £529.70 costs and a £60 victim surcharge.
