When your team is playing such stylish football, it's important to look the part too.

And Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp certainly did on Tuesday night as his side beat Arsenal 2-0 in the Champions League.

The popular coach wore a club-branded grey hoodie and black t-shirt on the sidelines as his side eased past the Gunners courtesy of goals either side of half-time from Ciro Immobile and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.

Arsene Wenger, by contrast, opted for the more traditional suit and club tie for the occasion

His casual attire was a stark contrast from that of Arsene Wenger, who was squirming in his dark suit and red tie as Arsenal struggled to compete.

But you'll need deep pockets if you want to copy Klopp's style.

The hoodie, which features the club slogan 'Borusse!' on the front and the club logo on the sleeve, is available on Dortmund's official online shop for £52.

The Puma t-shirt bearing the same logo will set you back £25 while the black and yellow jogging bottoms are £40.

Klopp usually completes his matchday outfit with a baseball cap though this was missing on this occasions. They cost between £16 and £24 in the store.

But it's surely a small price to pay to look so trendy...
