Celtic have kicked out a £3million move for defender Efe Ambrose from Greek giants Olympiacos.

Sportsmail understands the Greek league leaders enquired over the Nigerian’s availability with a view to concluding a deal before the close of the transfer window.

Scouring Europe for central defensive reinforcements, new Olympiacos coach Vitor Pereira has already tried for Portuguese defender Bruno Alves and West Brom’s Joleen Lescott.

And he faces further disappointment with Ambrose after Parkhead coach Ronny Deila resolved to keep hold of his first-team regulars in the current window.

The stopper had been linked with West Ham and Crystal Palace during Celtic’s winter trip to Gran Canaria, but the Norwegian shot down suggestions of an exit then when he said: ‘Efe is going to stay. That’s not true.’

Faced with a League Cup semi-final against Rangers and a Europa League last-32 clash with Inter Milan, Deila has set his sights on a domestic clean sweep and has asked the Celtic board to repel all moves for his top players.

Fellow defender Virgil van Dijk is also wanted by Sunderland and Southampton, while Leeds have been eyeing a move for striker Anthony Stokes.

Despite dropping out of the starting XI since Belgian Jason Denayer’s return from injury, however, Ambrose insists he is happy in Glasgow, saying earlier this month: ‘I am still a Celtic player and I will respect my contract. If an offer comes and Celtic accepts, fine. But otherwise, I will keep doing my best for Celtic and hopefully we will win the league again.’

Bolton have ended their interest in Celtic playmaker Kris Commons, who isn't for sale

Celtic are expected to make a last-gasp bid to land Dundee United's Gary Mackay-Steven

Intent on reinforcing their squad, Celtic are expected to make a last ditch bid to secure Gary Mackay-Steven this month, rather than waiting until the summer.

The champions are also weighing up a bid for his Dundee United team-mate Stuart Armstrong before the close of the window next Monday, with the Tayside club’s valuation of £3m the obstacle to a deal.

Former Celtic boss Neil Lennon ruled out a January move for Parkhead playmaker Kris Commons, who is out of contract at the end of the season.

The Bolton manager said: ‘Celtic have come out publicly and said he’s not for sale, he won’t be leaving and we haven’t pursued that any further.

‘I’ve got a great relationship with Celtic, a great relationship with Peter [Lawwell] and I don’t want to damage that.’
