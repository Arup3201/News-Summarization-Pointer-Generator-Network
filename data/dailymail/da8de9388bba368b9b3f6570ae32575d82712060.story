A professional boxer laundered money for rogue builders as he prepared to fight for the British title, a court has heard.

Welterweight Lee Purdy, 27, is accused of cashing cheques on behalf of his father Van  Purdy and his friend Jim Brown in 2011.

He and his stepmother, Rachel Poole, are alleged to have passed cheques, which had been paid to a gang of rogue builders, through their bank accounts. 

Purdy told a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court that he was being paid around £25,000 a match at the time of the alleged offences.

The jury heard he was arrested two years after the alleged offences and chose not to  have a solicitor when interviewed by police because he had 'done nothing wrong'

When asked about paying in the cheques he said: 'I didn't place a great significance on doing it for my dad. I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.'

He said there was no reason not to do what his father had asked him to do.

Purdy, 27, from Colchester, told the jury when he was in training, he would be at his gym in Romford for up to six hours a day.

'It's a lifestyle, it's what I do day in and day out,' he said. Anticipating a title fight was the most important thing in his mindset', he added. 

Well paid: Purdy said he earned around £25,000 a fight and denied that he was laundering money

He won the British title in April 2011 after knocking out his opponent but lost it 2013.

The court was told his career is now on hold after he suffered a detached retina at a match in December 2013

Purdy said he was blind in that eye and had undergone five operations this year. It is hoped he might regain some sight.

Poole, a 48-year-old nurse and care agency manager from The Nursery, Bromley Road, Ardleigh, told the court she had no reason to doubt her partner Jim Brown when he asked her to pay in some cheques.

The prosecution has alleged Poole used her bank account to launder a total of £11,650 while Purdy's alleged involvement amounted to £12,140.

Both deny the charges. The trial continues.
