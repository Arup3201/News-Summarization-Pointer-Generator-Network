The Prince of Wales was celebrating his 66th birthday today but chose to spend it working, with a visit to the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon.

But he did get a birthday present in the shape of a 62-gun Royal salute from members of Honourable Artillery Company in London, a second from the Royal Artillery and third from Scottish Gunners of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery in Scotland.

Charles, however, was not in London or Edinburgh to witness the display, as he had travelled to Warwickshire to visit the Royal Shakespeare Company of which he is patron.

Happy Birthday Prince Charles: The heir to the throne celebrated his 66th birthday today

Boom! Members of the Honourable Artillery Company unleash a 62-gun salute outside the Tower of London

And again! Scottish Gunners of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery fire a 21-gun salute at Edinburgh Castle

The visit, which was to present long service awards to members of the company, also saw him attend its AGM.

The Prince of Wales is one of only three members of the Royal Family whose birthday is marked with a cannon salute, the others being the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh.

Royal salutes are fired by members of the Honourable Artillery Company and the Royal Horse Artillery in London, with the latter going first and firing their cannons in Hyde Park.

A basic Royal salute involves 21 rounds but an extra 20 are added in Hyde Park because of its royal status.

A further 20 are added at the Tower of London, again because of its royal connections, and another 21 for the City of London.

Gallop: Soldiers from the King's Troop Royal Artillery gallop into position in Hyde Park

Charge! The ceremony is performed for the birthdays of Charles, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh

Quick march! The 19th Regiment Royal Artillery march into Edinburgh Castle to fire the Royal Salute

Fire! The men of the King's Troop Royal Artillery perform a 41-gun salute in Prince Charles' honour

And again! A second round is fired in Hyde Park, which gets 20 extra shots because of its royal status

As a result, the Tower holds the record for the most guns fired in a single salute, which takes place on the 10th June when the Queen's official birthday coincides with the Duke of Edinburgh's real one.

In total, 124 shots are fired by the King's Troop, Royal Artillery from their perch beside the Thames in the Tower grounds.

But London isn't the only place in the UK to resound with the sound of cannon fire on royal birthdays and anniversaries.

As the soldiers of the 19th Regiment Royal Artillery demonstrated, Edinburgh Castle, Cardiff and Hillsborough Castle in County Down in Northern Ireland also host military salutes. 

Other anniversaries marked by cannon salutes include Accession Day, Coronation Day and the State Opening of Parliament.

The moment a visiting head of state meets the Queen at Windsor, in London or Edinburgh is also marked with cannon fire.

Next! The Honourable Artillery Company performed the second royal salute of the day

Busy: The Company fires the biggest salute - 124 shots for the Queen and Prince Philip on 10th June

Royal salute: Today's royal salute involved 62 shots, including 20 for the Tower of London

Bang! A cannon roars into life from its perch on the battlements of Edinburgh Castle

Birthday: As in London, Edinburgh's guns fire on the birthdays of Charles, the Queen and Prince Philip
