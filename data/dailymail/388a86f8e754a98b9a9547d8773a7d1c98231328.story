Paul Cummins, the Derbyshire artist who created dozens of ceramic poppies for the Tower of London installation has received death threats because proceeds will be donated to military charities

The artist who created the sea of ceramic poppies at the Tower of London has revealed he received death threats over the project.

Paul Cummins created 888,246 poppies to be placed outside the Tower of London to remember all those who died in World War One for the Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red installation. 

But despite the success of the project, which saw thousands of people visit, Mr Cummins said he has received threatening phone calls and letters after it was announced that some of the proceeds from selling poppies would go to armed forces charities.

Around £10million has been raised for six military charities - including Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion - from the sale of the poppies, for around £31 each. 

But it appeared news of the fundraising angered some people and Mr Cummins, of Derbyshire, has received threats by email, letter and phone. 

'Even the police got involved,' he told the Sunday Times. 

'I suppose, because they felt that the money was going to charities which in some way were involved in the war.' 

Mr Cummins was made an MBE in the new years honours list for his role making the ceramic poppies for the installation. 

It was designed by Tom Piper, at his Derbyshire workshop.

The Tower of London installation earned Mr Cummins such acclaim he has been approached about other similar projects around the world.

He revealed his next project will involve not poppies but tulips and will be installed in Britain. But Mr Cummins has remained tight lipped about the precise location, which will be announced next month. 

The artist will be involved in another project with flowers in Europe in 2017 and then another in 2018 in a 'very distant country.' 

The 888,246 ceramic poppies almost filled the moat at the Tower of London for the WW1 installation 

Organisers warned people not to visit the installation after millions of people queued for hours to see it 

Around 150,000 people are still waiting for to receive their ceramic poppies from the installation and Mr Cummins has offered to replace those flowers that were delivered cracked. 

The poppies were hand-made in a painstaking operation by a small team and twice fired in Mr Cummins’ studio in Derbyshire. 

It then took around four months for them to be installed and the ceramic flowers almost filled the tower's 16-acre moat. 

Mr Cummins said the popularity of the installation was boosted by Royal visits, including from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry who visited in the early days of the project 

The ceramic poppies were sold for £31 each, including packing and posting, and some are still being sent

Mr Cummins said the success of the poppy installation surprised him, but he believes royal visits by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry early on helped to increase its popularity. 

The Queen and Prince Phillip visited the installation later in October.  

The artist opposed proposals by Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, for the poppies to remain at the Tower for a number of months because he said he did not want the work to become a strange tourist attraction.
