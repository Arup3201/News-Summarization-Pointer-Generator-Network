Controversial: Sally Mason has apologized for making a comment that implied that she felt sexual assaults were inevitable because of 'human nature'

The University of Iowa president has been forced to apologize after saying that sexual assaults were a result of 'human nature'.

Sally Mason made the controversial remark as part of a monthly interview with the campus newspaper and has faced an immediate backlash from student protestors who took her comments to mean that she thinks rape is inevitable.

'The goal would be to end that, to never have another sexual assault. That’s probably not a realistic goal just given human nature, and that’s unfortunate, but the more we understand about it, the better we are at trying to handle it and help people get through these difficult situations,' she said in the interview with The Daily Iowan.

Sexual assault has been a problem at the school in recent months with eight reported assaults on and near campus over the course of this academic year.

Now Mason, 63, has said that she is 'very, very sorry for any pain that my words might have caused'.

She also scheduled a 'listening post' this afternoon for students to air their grievances.

Bring the problem to the forefront: Protestors interrupted an event on Sunday where Mason spoke

Problem: Eight sexual assaults have been reported on or near the University of Iowa campus over this academic year

That didn't stop students from 
interrupting a speech in protest, as a line of current and former 
University of Iowa students stood in front of her during a lecture on 
Sunday.

Holding posters and with some of their mouths symbolically taped shut, they interrupted her opening remarks, forcing her to address her previous statement.

'She doesn't stand with victims... Sally Mason is part of the problem at this campus... Rape is not in human nature,' the protesters said.

Mason was determined to continue with the event- but briefly addressed their concerns before moving on.

'We will make more progress on this issue, I promise you,' she said to the protestors.

'They are absolutely right and I very much appreciate their point of view. Clearly we are dealing in our society today with some serious issues and this is one of those very serious issues. I applaud our students for the activism they show on this particular issue. I think it's a very important one.'
