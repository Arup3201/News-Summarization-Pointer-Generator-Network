Two fossilised footprints made around 105 million years ago are believed to be the oldest known bird tracks in Australia.

Scientists believe the prints found in a place called Dinosaur Cove were likely made by birds during the Early Cretaceous period.

The journal Palaeontology reports that much of the rocky coastal strata of Dinosaur Cove in southern Victoria were formed in river valleys in a polar climate during the Early Cretaceous.

The Cretaceous bird tracks were found on a slab of sandstone. Scientists believe the prints found in a place called Dinosaur Cove were likely made by birds during the Early Cretaceous period

A great rift valley formed as the ancient supercontinent Gondwana broke up and Australia separated from Antarctica.

‘These tracks are evidence that we had sizeable, flying birds living alongside other kinds of dinosaurs on these polar, river floodplains, about 105 million years ago,’ said Dr Anthony Martin, a paleontologist at Emory University in Atlanta.

Dr Martin added that the thin-toed tracks in fluvial sandstone were likely made by two individual birds that were about the size of a great egret or a small hero.

Great egrets measure between 80 to 104 cm (31 to 41 in) in length.

Rear-pointing toes helped distinguish the tracks as avian, as opposed to a third nearby fossil track that was discovered at the same time, made by a non-avian theropod.

A long drag mark on one of the two bird tracks particularly interested Dr Martin who said: ‘I immediately knew what it was - a flight landing track - because I’ve seen many similar tracks made by egrets and herons on the sandy beaches of Georgia.’

Dinosaur Cove has yielded a rich trove of non-avian dinosaur bones from dozens of species, but only one skeletal piece of a bird – a fossilised wishbone – has been found in the Cretaceous rocks of Victoria.

Dr Martin spotted the first known dinosaur trackway of Victoria in 2010 and a few other tracks have been discovered since then.

The tracks were made on the moist sand of a river bank, perhaps following a polar winter, after spring and summer flood waters had subsided.

‘The biggest question for me,’ said Dr Martin, ‘is whether the birds that made these tracks lived at the site during the polar winter, or migrated there during the spring and summer.’

One of the best records of the dinosaur-bird connection has come from discoveries in Liaoning province of Northeastern China, including fossils of non-avian dinosaurs with feathers.

Samples of amber have also been found in Liaoning, containing preserved feathers from both birds and non-avian dinosaurs going back to the Cretaceous.

‘In contrast, the picture of early bird evolution in the Southern Hemisphere is mostly incomplete,’ said Dr Martin. ‘but with these tracks, it just got a little better.’
