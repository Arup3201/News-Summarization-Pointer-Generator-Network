A woman police sergeant was found hanged today by stunned colleagues who had been searching for her since she vanished four days ago.

Sgt Louise Gibson, 43, had been at the centre of a huge manhunt by police, who discovered her body around 4pm.

The married mother-of-three originally from Macclesfield, who served with Thames Valley Police Force for more than 10 years, has not been seen since 5.30pm on Thursday, when she left her parents’ house in Buckinghamshire.

Tragic: The body of WPS Louise Gibson, 43, was found dead today, four days after going missing from her parents' home in Buckinghamshire

ACC Chris Shead said: “It is with great sadness that we can confirm a body, believed to be our missing colleague Louise Gibson, was found in Little Kingshill, Buckinghamshire, this afternoon.

'Louise’s family, friends and colleagues have been informed and are being supported. I would ask that their privacy is respected.

'This is a very sad time for her family and everyone at Thames Valley Police. We have a fine tradition of pulling together in times of adversity and I am confident we will continue to pull together and support each other.

'I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the public and the search teams for their tireless efforts in the search for Louise.'

She was found in a wooded area of the leafy village of Great Kingshill today after a nationwide missing person’s appeal failed to reveal any trace of her whereabouts.

The blonde mother’s worried relatives had spread news of her disappearance online in a bid to bring her back home.

However, her policeman husband and children received the news today that police involved in the search had found her dead body.

The death is currently being treated as unexplained although it is believed that she had committed suicide.

The policewoman’s eldest daughter, Beth Pettit, 25, gave an interview just hours before her mother was found.

She said: ‘Mum is a wonderful person and we are desperate to get her back home.

‘We have no idea what happened and that makes it really difficult to deal with. There were no mental health issues and this is completely out of character.

‘Mum always put everyone first. She was really well respected in her job and a great leader. She planned to take her inspector’s exam soon.’

Sgt Gibson, who was married once before, had two children, Beth and Robert, with her first husband Tony Cook.

After they divorced, she married policeman John Gibson. Both were based at High Wycombe Police Station.

The circumstances that led to her death were set to be probed by the Buckinghamshire coroner, who will open an inquest later this week.
