It may take more than a campaign to stop Chelsea this season.

Jose Mourinho has been charged by the FA for insinuating that referees were being influenced by the media and therefore not giving his team the benefit of the doubt in key decisions. And he was given further ‘evidence’ for his dossier when referee Roger East failed to give them a penalty for a Fabrico Coloccini handball.

But whatever the FA rule, it will prove largely irrelevant in the long run. For Chelsea look to be the team most likely to take advantage of opponents’ weaknesses and forge ahead in the title race.

They were not scintillating, though Eden Hazard’s chipped pass and Oscar’s flick for Diego Costa’s goal will bear multiple replays. At times, however, Newcastle stretched them and even bettered them.

Yet while Manchester City were dropping points against Everton, Chelsea were ruthlessly exploiting mistakes. Sterner tests lie ahead but this is a Newcastle team who beat them a month ago, so this victory was an important step on the way to proving their resilience.

Mourinho was again not speaking publicly, his FA charge given as the reason, so it was left to his assistant Steve Holland to explain how the improvement had been obtained at half time. ‘Jose was very clear to the players what he wanted from them to improve and the players did that, they responded very well,’ he said.

‘Jose wanted the team to press further up the pitch and to be mentally more aggressive and assertive with or without the ball and to play at a quicker tempo and they did that.’

This may be John Carver’s last match in charge — a draw and two defeats hardly represents compelling credentials since Alan Pardew’s departure — with Remi Garde in discussion with the club, but at least his side went down fighting after the debacle of last Saturday’s FA Cup defeat when they were booed by their own fans.

And if Garde is to be installed he will at least find a compatriot who finally appears up for the fight. Remy Cabella had made 21 appearances for Newcastle prior to this game and, for £12million, he has produced zero goals thus far. And yet, in the first half, he was unrecognisable.

John Terry suffered but so too did Cesar Azipilicueta, with two of the most consistent defenders so far this season made to look ordinary. The Spaniard was withdrawn in the 37th minute because of a groin injury but Cabella had already made it a sufficiently miserable afternoon for the left back to be grateful for small mercies.

Cabella had slalomed his way past three players in the 20th minute with a burst of pace unseen so far and Terry deflected his shot wide; later he would skip past Terry and only a fine save from Petr Cech prevented him opening the scoring.

‘He has been a little bit frustrating but I think he showed his value today,’ said Carver. ‘He was outstanding in possession and every time he tried to break, someone was clipping him to stop his momentum. He added the other side of the game, which was hard work.

‘He has now set a standard and I told him in front of everybody, “It’s no good you just doing that on a one-off. If you’re not prepared to do it every week, you’ll be sitting with me and Stoney [Steve Stone] on the bench”. But if he performs like that he could get our fans on the edge of the seat —because he had me on the edge of mine today.’

Cabella even survived a strong arm in the face from Nemanja Matic in the 71st minute, which saw a yellow card for the Serbian but which might have been red.

And it was not just Cabella. Cech, deputising for Thibaut Courtois, who has an injured thumb but was deemed fit enough for the bench, had to save smartly from Yoan Gouffran’s 22nd-minute free-kick, while Moussa Sissoko cut inside with Terry again exposed and hit a shot that struck the post

So it was all the more galling for Carver’s team when Chelsea, having threatened very little, were presented with a chance to take the lead. Willian was the opportunist, taking a quick short corner which out-witted Coloccini and found Branislav Ivanovic. With Newcastle unprepared, it was a relatively easy task for the Bulgarian to find Oscar at the far post for a simple finish in the 43rd minute.

‘It was very frustrating — just before half-time we switched off, like we did against Leicester,’ said Carver. ‘I made a big point of it and it happened again.’

It was enough to give Chelsea the foundation they needed. They started the second half with an intent and incisiveness which had been missing in the opening 45 minutes. And for those who enjoy the conspiracy theory, there was fuel to fire Mourinho’s talk of a campaign when Costa crossed the ball 10 minutes into the restart only for Coloccini’s out-stretched hand to prevent it reaching danger. It was a penalty and Costa and Cesc Fabregas protested furiously.

There was no lingering sense of injustice, however, as within four minutes Chelsea had extended their lead. Hazard had Newcastle mesmerised as he chipped a ball in for Oscar. The Brazilian executed an exquisite flick back to Costa, who cut inside to score his 15th goal of the season. ‘That was much more like the Chelsea the supporters would be used to,’ said Holland.

Costa might have made it 3-0 in the 79th minute, beating each member of Newcastle’s back four before allowing his wayward shot to be deflected wide by Coloccini.

Chelsea may not invincible this season, as Newcastle proved but a month ago. But give them a break and you are unlikely to recover.
