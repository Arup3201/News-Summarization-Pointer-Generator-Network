British holidaymakers take nearly five days to get fully into 'holiday mode' and forget about work, a new study has found.

Just one in 10 workers - or 12 per cent - are fully relaxed just one day into their break.

18 per cent of us now find it so 
difficult to disconnect from work we confess to never completely 
relaxing or switching off from our job.

Holiday mode: It takes the average Briton nearly five days to fully relax while on vacation, a study has found

The average Briton now takes four days, eight hours and 24 minutes to fully unwind, the study found.

The researchers found 28 per cent of people need at least five days to get into holiday mode and 40 per cent manage to unwind four days in.

Administrator Hannah Smith, 28, agrees it takes her a couple of days to properly relax when she goes away.

Miss Smith, from Lincoln, said: 'I really look forward to the holiday time I've booked off, but then end up feeling tired when it swings around.

'You still have work issues whirring 
around in your head and it's hard to leave it all behind and not worry 
about how your colleagues are getting on.

'Now
I make sure I have at least one day at home to deal with chores and 
chill out before jetting off somewhere nice, so I will enjoy it to the 
full.'

Michael Gentle, head 
of consumer marketing at Monster.co.uk, said: 'The fact it is taking so 
long for workers to unwind on holiday is indicative of the 'always 
switched on' culture we now live in.

'In the past we used to be able to go on holiday and disappear from the "working world".

'Now most of us go away armed with our mobiles and tablets, and don't think anything of checking our work emails from our Mediterranean villa.

'While the British work ethic should be applauded, holidays provide an important opportunity to refresh and recharge the batteries, ready for the challenges ahead.

'By not relaxing fully, workers are putting themselves at risk of burn out, which will be detrimental to them and their employer in the long run.

'So remember to switch off, enjoy the break and leave work to your capable colleagues back home.'
