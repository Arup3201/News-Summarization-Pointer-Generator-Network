The idea of holding a hot hairdryer over your brand new trainers might sound bizarre.

But for those looking for the perfect fit (and trying to avoid the agonising ritual of breaking in new trainers), this is exactly what Reebok suggests you do.

The sports brand has brought out the new U-form+ trainer, literally the hottest running shoe on the market, designed to shrink-to-fit using heat from your hairdryer.

The new Reebok U-Form+ is designed to 'shrink to fit' and mould exactly to the individual foot

The hair dryer should be held about 10cm away from the shoes for two minutes

As anyone who has worn ill-fitting trainers knows, there is nothing like a blister or a twisted angle to sabotage even the most dedicated runner, ad these hi-tech new shoes aim to put an end to these annoyances.

They look like normal high-end sneakers, but they come with instructions about how to put them under the hair dryer before hitting the treadmill.

Exclusive to InterSport, the Reebok U-Form+ are different from the original Reebok U-Form, which needed to be put into the oven for three minutes.

The unique U-Form+ material is inside the shoe, starting in the mid-foot and wrapping around the heel.

You hold a hair dryer about 10cm away from the shoes, off your feet, for 2 minutes to heat them up, before putting them on and lacing them up tightly.

The material is secured around the foot by the lacing system, so when it's laced it locks down around your foot and heel.

It then 'fits' round your foot, supposedly giving a perfect fit and improving running performance.

A button on the heel of the shoes turns bright red when the trainers are at the correct temperature

As the trainers cool down they fit to your foot, which is meant to improve performance and reduce the likelihood of injury

The original U-Form trainers go into a preheated oven at 93 degrees Celsius for three minutes, until the 'U-Form' tab turns red.

Assuming you haven't over-cooked your trainers, they should be warm but not too hot to put on.

You then lace them up to your preferred tightness and wear them, while seated, for eight minutes.

As they cool they shrink round your feet, and in the sitting position they should give optimal support to your feet, ankles and leg muscles.

Available in both men and women's sizes, the U-form trainers cost £100, and while some amateurs might balk at spending that on something you might accidentally set on fire, running enthusiasts seem to be willing to go to any length to get the perfect fit.
