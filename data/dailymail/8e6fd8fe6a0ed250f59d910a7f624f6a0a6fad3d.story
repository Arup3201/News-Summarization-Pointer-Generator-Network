A hotel owner doubled the price of wedding receptions at the last minute - and then branded couples who could not afford the hike 'chavs'.

Alice Tarry, 49, left dozens of brides-to-be devastated after she drastically raised the cost of hiring the posh Walton Hotel in Nottingham.

In some cases, the price had more than doubled - with one bill seeing the cost of restaurant hire soar from £250 to £1,000.

Ms Tarry, who took over the three-star hotel in February, gave engaged couples the choice of paying the revised rates or cancelling their bookings.

Many were forced to cancel the venue just weeks before their big day, while others had to scrap their honeymoons too because of the short notice.

Ms Tarry later took to Facebook to answer complaints about the price hike - and called couples who could not afford it 'chavs'.

Some of the price hikes at the Walton Hotel in Nottingham include: Restaurant hire: £250 to £1,000.Ten bottles of Prosecco: £199.50 to £299.50.Evening barbecue buffet: £1,196 to £1,600.Service charge: £150 to £507.08.

The new owner, who is married to David Shelton, the millionaire boss of UK car supermarket Motorpoint, wrote: 'Really need your support. Please 
check and befriend the Walton Hotel, Nottingham.

'Would you please checkout the backlash from the wedding chavs. I need a thumbs up on my comment as support.'

Heather Sulley, 26, was planning to hold her wedding reception at the hotel on August 16 when she received an email saying the cost had risen from £5,190 to £7,751.

Now, she and her fiancé Darren Smith, 31, have been forced to cancel their plans - and may also have to scrap their honeymoon to Mexico.

Ms Sulley, from Carlton, Nottingham, said: 'When I got the email my heart sank. The new owner said that she had taken over and that the price had gone up and the rooms had also gone up to between £110 and £160, even though we had agreed £70.

'I emailed back asking her to call me and she never did. It would have been easier to speak to the Queen than the owner.

'I was eventually sent a new inventory last Friday night and I broke down in tears because everything had gone up by £2,500.

'My mum found the Facebook comment and made us aware. It really upset her. We felt her [Ms Tarry] and her friends were laughing at us.

'We have managed to secure another place but we've had to find extra money which is jeopardising our honeymoon. We don't think we can afford it.'

Other customers claimed Ms Tarry had failed to give an explanation as to why the the fees had been increased at such short notice.

Web designer Christopher Dowson and his bride-to-be Clare Gunning were asked to pay an extra £1,500 for their reception, which was due to take place next Saturday.

The 33-year-old, of Netherfield, Nottingham, said: 'It took us several weeks to track down the new price and when we did we saw that everything was much more expensive.

'We had agreed on £3,000 and that went up to £4,500 - I do not know how they can justify this behaviour.'

Ms Tarry married Mr Shelton at the luxury four-star Rushton Hall in Northamptonshire in front of 100 guests in December 2012, before going on a honeymoon in Thailand.

The couple now live in a sprawling Grade II-listed farmhouse, worth £1million, in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire.

The hotel owner has refused to apologise for the price hike, which came into effect last week, but has admitted her Facebook post was 'inappropriate'.

'I'd like to personally apologise for any distress and inconvenience this has caused. It has been a difficult situation for all concerned,' she said.

'As new owners of The Walton, we are passionate about ensuring it remains one of Nottingham city centre's best-loved independent hotels, and, in order to do this, we have had make some changes so it can be a sustainable and successful business in the future.

'This means we have had to discuss some previously agreed rates with some customers. We have offered a full refund or new rates to the couples affected in line with the terms and conditions of their agreements, and have personally discussed their options with them.

'We're sorry if some of the couples no longer wish to hold their weddings with us, and wish them all the very best for the future.

She added: 'Regarding the Facebook post, I'm sorry for any offence caused by comments I made on my personal social network site. They were meant to be private, but were inappropriate and were made in a moment of frustration, for which I apologise.'

Under law, a new company has no legal obligation in relation to agreements made by previous owners.

Trading Standards manager Jane Bailey said: 'We have had a complaint about the change in terms of a contract, but we are not currently investigating the hotel.'
