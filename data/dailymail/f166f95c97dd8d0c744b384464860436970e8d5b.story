One of the most glaring errors in Jurassic Park - if you move past the minor technicality that various species of dinosaurs were brought back from extinction - is that the mosquito caught inside the famous amber sample is a fraud.

In the film, blood contained in the gut of the mosquito is extracted by Richard Attenborough's character John Hammond and spliced with frog DNA to kick off the dinosaur cloning process.

However, entomologists have now claimed that the particular mosquito used in the film is the only species that doesn't suck blood at all - making the extraction of the dino DNA impossible. 

In the film Jurassic Park, blood is extracted from a prehistoric mosquito encased in a preserved piece of amber by Richard Attenborough, pictured. This one action sets up the entire film, but experts have now claimed this to be impossible - mainly because the mosquito used is the only species that doesn't suck blood at all

Toxorhynchites are also known as 'elephant mosquitos.

They the largest known species of mosquito.

They also make up the only species that do not suck blood.

Instead, adult T. rutiluss feed from honeydew, sap, nectar and fruit.

Most species live in forests.

Retired entomologist Joe Conlon told Business Insider that mosquitoes were around during the time of the dinosaurs, dating back 170 million years, and would have ultimately fed on their blood.

Yet, not the one Steven Spielberg used in the 1993 film.

Conlon said: 'Unfortunately, the species portrayed in Jurassic Park - Toxorhynchites rutilus - doesn't feed on blood. It's actually the only type of mosquito that doesn't.'

The mosquito in the film is also shown with a hairy antennae, suggesting it is a male T. rutilus.

This further boosts Conlon's claims.

Only females of blood-sucking mosquito species sucks blood.

Thirdly, the movie shows the mosquito being found in the Dominican Republic, yet that region has never produced fossils dating back that far.

Spielberg is believed to have chosen the T. rutilus because it is the largest species of mosquito known to man - so big it has been dubbed 'elephant mosquito' - and this would have made it easier to film.

This doesn't mean the concept of a real-life Jurassic Park should be completely disregarded, though.

Scientists spliced the blood extracted from the mosquito with frog DNA to clone the dinosaurs seen in all three Jurassic Park films. Lead character Dr Alan Grant, played by Sam Neil, is pictured in a scene from Jurassic Park III (2001)

Last year, perfectly preserved cells from a woolly mammoth were found in Siberia, bringing closer the prospect of a cloned comeback for the iconic tusked creature.

An international team of researchers discovered the unique material in a permafrost mammoth graveyard in remote Yakutia, in the east of Russia.

The find included ''soft, fatty tissue, hair, bone marrow of the mammoth', said the Semyon Grigoryev, Director of the Mammoth Museum at the North-Eastern Federal University in Yakutsk, who led the expedition.

The sample is now on display in Tokyo, and scientists are looking at ways in which they could bring the animal back from extinction.
