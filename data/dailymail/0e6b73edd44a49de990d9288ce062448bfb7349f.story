More than 600,000 people have fled villages in the Philippines as the country braces itself for Typhoon Haiyan - which is only hours away from the country's eastern coast.

The military has gone on full alert today as the powerful storm, named Hagupit which means 'smash' in Filipino, is expected to hit later this afternoon.

The area is still haunted by Typhoon Haiyan's massive devastation in November 2013, which claimed the lives of more than 7,000 people.

While it is not expected to reach Haiyan's unprecedented strengths, forecasters said its maximum sustained winds of 109mph and gusts of 130 mph were strong enough to set off deadly storm surges and landslides and cause heavy damage to communities and agriculture.

'We're on red alert, so the entire armed forces is being mobilized for this typhoon,' Gen. Gregorio Pio Catapang, head of the Philippines' 120,000-strong military, told a news conference after discussing last-minute preparations.

Army troops deployed to supermarkets and major roads in provinces in the typhoon's path to prevent looting and chaos and clear debris, all of which slowed the government's response last year, Catapang said. 

With a whirling band of rain clouds spanning 373 miles, Hagupit has gained speed and was moving westward at 10mph, according to forecasters.

In the central city of Tacloban, where Haiyan's storm surges killed thousands of people and leveled villages, news of the approaching typhoon rekindled painful memories.

Many residents fled to storm shelters, a sports stadium and churches even before authorities urged them to evacuate.

Social welfare secretary Corazon Soliman said: 'Over 100,000 families are already in evacuation centers. Multiply it by five (people a family), that's 500,000.'

Mayor of Manila Joseph Estrada added: 'We have alerted the people of Manila and we're ready. These typhoons change direction all the time.' 

More than 2,000 people were left stranded in the city as ports closed across the nation. Some Philippine Airlines and Cebu Pacific flights in the south of the nation were shut as the storm closed in. 

'I'm scared,' said Haiyan survivor Jojo Moro. 'I'm praying to God not to let another disaster strike us again. We haven't recovered from the first.'

The 42-year-old businessman, who lost his wife, daughter and mother last year in Tacloban, said he stocked up on sardines, instant noodles, eggs and water.

A U.N. humanitarian agency spokesman, Denis McClean, said in Geneva that it was one of the largest peacetime evacuations in Philippine history. It also was reminiscent of the evacuation of 1 million people along India's coastline before Cyclone Phailin hit in October 2013.

Nearly 100 domestic flights have been canceled and inter-island ferry services suspended, stranding thousands of people.

'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated,' regional disaster-response director Blanche Gobenciong said. 'Their trauma is still so fresh.' 

In Tacloban, residents stacked sandbags to block floodwaters. One McDonald's restaurant was closed and boarded up to prevent a repetition of Haiyan's deluge, which shattered glass panes and doors of business establishments, allowing looting to take place.

Disaster preparations widened after two agencies tracking the typhoon closely — the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center in Hawaii and the Philippine weather agency — predicted different directions for Hagupit.

The U.S. agency said Hagupit may veer northwest after coming inland and sweep past the southern edge of Manila, the capital city of more than 12 million people. The Philippine agency, known by its acronym PAGASA, projected a more southern path. 

Forecasts show the typhoon is expected to travel across central Philippines, with some suggesting it could veer north towards Manila

Dr Steven Godby, expert in natural hazards at Nottingham Trent University, said: 'No other country is struck by as many tropical cyclones each year as the Philippines.

'For these storms to form, warm sea surface temperatures of at least 26C are needed and these conditions are found in the western parts of the main ocean basins, away from cold water currents.  

'Isolated island groups like the Philippines are particularly vulnerable to tropical cyclones.'

Hundreds of people still living in tents following Haiyan, known as Yolanda in the Philippines, were among the first to be relocated to safe zones in Tacloban, which has run out of hotel rooms as wealthier families booked ahead for the weekend.  

Rita Villadolid, a 39-year-old taking refuge inside a stadium, said: 'We've learned our lesson from Yolanda. Everyone here is gripped with fear.'

Disaster response official Blanche Gobenciong said nearly 12,000 residents in Tacloban, where entire settlements were wiped out by the storm, have so far been moved from high-risk villages to emergency shelters.

She said: 'We've not heard of villagers resisting to be evacuated. Their trauma is still so fresh. 

'We have a zero-casualty target. Just one loss of life will really sadden us all and make us wonder what went wrong.'

International relief teams are already positioned in the Philippines, ready for the worst.

Kevin Noone, executive director of International Medical Corps UK, which has workers on the ground prepared for the storm, said: 'Coming just one year after Typhoon Haiyan, this storm has the potential to cause widespread damage and human suffering. Our teams are on the ground and prepared for whatever the next 48 hours has in store for the people of the Philippines.'

The typhoon was downgraded to a category 4 today, a level below a 'super typhoon', with hopes it may weaken to winds of around 108mph by the time it strikes tomorrow.
