An online fundraising campaign has raised nearly $9,000 in just a day for the family of the two young girls who were killed when a tree fell on their car in Pennsylvania on Monday.

Ryleigh Freiwald, eight, and 
Macayla Freiwald, six, died when the car driven by their stepfather Jason 
Hinebaugh, 36, was crushed by a rotted tree as they drove along a road in Conemaugh Township.

The girls' mother, eight-month pregnant Ashley Lichty, 26, and their sister, Ciara, five, and Lillie, three, were also in the car, which lost control and slammed into a utility pole.

Witnesses to the harrowing 
crash recounted how their mother burst out of the passenger side of the car 
screaming: 'My babies, my babies.'

After the tragedy, a friend launched a fundraising page in an attempt to raise $10,000 to cover the girls' funeral costs.

But
 in just one day, the page nearly reached the target as well-wishers 
flocked to the page to pass on their condolences to the devastated 
family.

Both Lichty and Hinebaugh are now in 
intensive care at Conemaugh Memoiral Medical Center, but both are 
expected to recover. The younger girls suffered minor injuries.

The family friend who created the page, Katrina Marie, updated donors on the page on Wednesday.

'I got to see the little ones today,' she wrote. 'They are in good spirits and know that their big sisters are in heaven watching over them. Ashley had been moved and doing well.'

Lichty, who is eight months pregnant, has not lost her child, according to Conemaugh Township Police chief Louis Barclay.

'She got out of the vehicle,' he said to WPXI. 'The driver was unconscious behind the wheel.'

Paramedic Adma Trabold of Conemaugh Township EMS described the harrowing scene in the aftermath of the accident.

'After I arrived on the scene, it was uncontrolled chaos,' Trabold said.

'We were trying to get everything done. Once you get more resources, you're able to focus on one patient at a time. I tried to treat each patient as my family member.'

Terry Ruparcic, who manages the EMS station said the accident was a '9 out of 10' on the scale of traumatic accidents he has seen.

The paramedics were given the opportunity to talk to mental health counselors after the accident.

Hinebaugh has been dating Lichty for about 18 months and is about eight months pregnant with his child, said a friend to WPXI.

Devastating: This is the wreckage of the family car that led to the deaths of two of the four children in the backseat

Police say the male driver, a pregnant woman and the other two children were injured and taken to Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center.

Witness Sandy Seth lives along the street from the accident and heard the crash happen in the middle of Monday afternoon.

'This was pure mother nature at its worst,' said Sandy to WTAJ. 'I saw a lady get out of the passenger seat screaming, 'My babies, my babies'.

'We
 heard the thump, we didn't come out right away. We watched the 
emergency services cut the doors off and cut the roof off and get the 
driver out of the car.

'I am glad we didn't come out when we first heard the thump otherwise we wouldn't have been able to sleep for days.'

Freak accident: The car can be seen in the distance and the tree in the fore front of the screen shot

Severe: The four surviving members of the family were taken to hospital after the accident

Erosion: This is the stump of the tree that authorities believe had rotted away before the accident on Monday

Chief Louis Barclay of the Conemaugh Township Police said heâ€™s shocked at the freak nature of the accident.

'In my 23-years here I have never had anything like this,' said Chief Louis Barclay. 'To have two young children die in the same family it must be horrendous on the parents, I can't even imagine.'

Authorities said the tree was rotten at the base but they don't know what caused the tree to fall.
