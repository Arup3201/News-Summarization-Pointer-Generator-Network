A five-year-old told she would never walk unaided has undergone pioneering surgery and now been offered a place at Britain's top ballet school.

Matilda Duncan was born with cerebral palsy but had an operation paid for by a fundraising campaign launched by her best friend Casey Burke - who also has the debilitating condition.

Now, just 13 weeks later, she is well on the road to recovery, and has been offered a place at the prestigious English National Ballet School.

Her 
Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure - an operation that improves mobility by cutting nerves in the lower spine - was funded by a campaign started by
 her best pal Casey, five, who suffers from a form of cerebral palsy 
that cannot be fixed by the operation.

The
 procedure, which was carried out on May 23 at Great Ormond Street 
Hospital, is not currently fully available on the NHS, so Casey, with a 
little help from her mum, launched a campaign to get 25,000 people to 
each donate £1 to cover the cost of the pre and post-op care.

Matilda, who is also known as Tilly, said: 'I always wanted to grow up to be a dancer or a footballer, and now I can. I can't wait to start dancing, and I can play with my brother now too.

'I have Casey to thank for this. She'll be my best friend forever.'

The girls, who became best friends when they met at nursery, were both born prematurely, and both have perfectly healthy twins.

Matilda has an able-bodied twin brother Matthew, who is now delighted he has somebody to play football with in the family's back garden, in Hayes, west London.

Mum Rachel Knowles, 41, said the difference was 'astonishing'.

'To be told your child is never going to be able to walk unaided is something no parent should ever have to be told.

'But now that Tilly has had this operation, everything in our lives has improved.

'She's happier than ever, and so is Matthew too.

'They're forever playing out in the garden now. Tilly doesn't get as tired, and neither do I.

'She still gets a bit stuck sometimes and struggles, but she's improving all the time and it's nowhere near as bad as it was.

'We've been told that in about two years, it'll be like she never had any mobility issues.

'And for her to be offered a place at a ballet school is just amazing. If anybody had done that this time last year, I would have thought they were making fun of us.

'But now Tilly's the one making her own fun, and it's brilliant.'

The NHS pay for the operation itself but Great Ormond Street Hospital require parents to fund the expensive rehabilitation.

But the 'Walking Matilda' campaign went viral, and raised £40,000 in a little over two days, meaning Matilda's family have been able to pay for her operation, and donate the rest towards another little child's operation.

Matilda's shop-worker mother has been with her project manager partner Matthew Duncan, 41, for 18 years.

Matilda's family discovered she was eligible for the revolutionary Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy procedure just before Christmas.

Her mother said: 'I'm so happy. When we first found out that Matilda could have the operation, and were told it would cost us £25,648, it was bittersweet.

'We never thought we'd be able to afford it. It was heartbreaking. We never would have been able to pay for the operation without Casey, her mum, and all the wonderful and generous people who donated.

'If I could kiss each and every one of them, I would. I can't thank people enough, it's changed all of our lives for the better.

'Now when I cry it's through happiness rather than tears of sadness.'

Casey, who cannot have the operation, uses a wheelchair and a walker, and lives with her parents Suzanne and Mike, in Flitwick, Bedfordshire.

The English National Ballet School, based in Fulham, south west London, offers a range of classes and courses for children of all ages, and have offered Matilda a place in their juniors class which starts in October.

She is now raising money for Tree of Hope, a charity which helps families in similar situations fund the same procedure.
