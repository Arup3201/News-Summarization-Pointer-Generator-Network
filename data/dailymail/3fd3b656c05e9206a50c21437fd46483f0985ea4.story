A father-of-two was killed in a 
horrifying accident when a giant inflatable ball in which he and another
 man were rolling down a mountain plunged off a cliff at a ski-resort in
 southern Russia.

Denis Burakov, 27, married with two young daughters, broke his neck and spine in the zorbing accident, say reports.

His companion Vladimir Shcherbov, 33, 
was hospitalised with concussion and multiple lacerations to the head 
and body, but miraculously was later released.

Denis Burakov, 27, was killed in a horrifying accident when a giant inflatable ball in which he and another man were rolling down a mountain plunged off a cliff.  Pictured: Mr  Burakov with his two daughters and his wife

Tragic accident: One of the zorbing operators holds the sphere securely as the path it is meant to travel down stretches out ahead

The so-called 'orb' was supposed to 
come to a halt at the bottom of a gentle snowy piste, designed for the sport, which originates in New Zealand.

But in a terrifying accident filmed by the victim's friends, it lurched first to the right and then to the left.

As he got into the giant ball, an 
unnamed friend - who filmed the horror - is heard saying: 'Denis, you'll 
be like Jackie Chan in the Armour of God movie!'

Unknown to come: The pair set off on their journey as they are rolled down the slope by the operators

Bouncing ride: The giant sphere bounces down the path as the pair spin around while harnessed into place

An instructor is asked how far the 
'orb' can go, replying 'not that far' and explaining there was a man 
lower down the mountain ready to catch it if it went off track. 

But as it is pushed down the slope, a man's voice is heard saying: 'Oh f***, it's gone in the wrong direction again.'

Suddenly the male voice screams:  'Hold it, hold it! Hold!'  Then he says: 'Ah well, it's OK, it'll stop by itself.'

The ball crashes through rocks and teeters on the edge of ravine - before disappearing from view, over the cliff.

Uncontrollable: The ball rolls to the bottom of the hill where people are waiting, but then suddenly veers off to left

Panic: As the massive sphere rolls across the path a figure can be seen desperately chasing after it

Desperate: When the ball rolls over the side of the slope it starts to gather momentum and turns

The friend filming the death ride plunge asks: 'What's going on there?'

The voice replies: 'Nothing.' But then calmly adds: 'A catastrophe.'  At this the footage stops. 

At terrifying speed, the ball had 
plunged down Ganachhirskiy Gorge in the Dombai resort complex in 
Russia's North Caucasus mountain range.

Falling steeply and battered by rocks, it was pulled down relentlessly by gravity.

'The orb went on for about one and a 
half kilometres, jumping on the rocks and hitting them,' said anaide to 
local police commander Sergei Shuvayev .

It came to rest on a frozen lake called Peacock's Eye.

Surrounded by thick woodland it took 
rescuers an agonising long time to reach the stricken men, and drag the 
orb onto firm ground.

When they got there, Mr Burakov from 
Pyatigorsk,  was still alive but he died on the way to hospital on the 
day of the incident, 3 January.

Speed: Although the ball slows at a bump - it is not clear from the video which it is - it then tips over and speeds up

Fatal: In the final shot of the terrifying video the ball can be seen spinning out of control down a steep incline

His companion survived.  'He was extremely lucky to get away so lightly,' said a local report.

'As for whatever they felt falling 
down the slope it is hard even to imagine. Some compare the pressure to 
what cosmonauts feel,' said the Stavropol edition of Komsomolskaya 
Pravda newspaper.

A probe has been opened into criminal negligence causing death on the part of the extreme sports organisers.

The maximum penalty is ten years in prison.

Astonishingly there were no barriers to prevent the out of control orb rolling relentlessly down the mountain.

Friends said that he had gone on a ski-ing holiday following the New Year.

'He became intrigued about the orb 
and the man said the trips were only 300 roubles - and that it was great
 fun,' said an onlooker.

'Denis was known to love extreme adventures,' said a friend.

He enjoyed visiting the mountains in winter and summer.

It was not immediately clear if his wife, Ekaterina, and his young daughters were with him in Dombai.
