If it is still true that a strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England then Alastair Cook can look forward to a golden era, with the White Rose at the forefront of both the international game and the chase for domestic honours.

Yorkshire’s march towards the county championship title, which can be confirmed if they avoid defeat against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge this week, could be the start of something big at Headingley and beyond.

Not only are Yorkshire on the verge of clinching the greatest prize in the domestic game but they are doing it with a squad crammed with potential England players and an academy bulging with many more top prospects. 

Champions elect: Jason Gillespie's Yorkshire could clinch the title this week 

At the forefront of Yorkshire’s rise towards their first title in 13 years is an ex-Australian Test bowler who has made it his mission to provide the old enemy with as many aspiring internationals as possible.

What’s more, Jason Gillespie is making sure that a county once known for their divisive internal politics have a smile on their face as they march forward with young players very much to the fore.

‘Since I’ve been at the club all I’ve done is tell the lads to back themselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play,’ said Gillespie ahead of Tuesday’s showdown with their biggest rivals for the county title. ‘Be positive, go out with a smile and enjoy the game.

‘I coach because I love cricket and I love helping lads achieve their dreams. And spectators come and watch because they love the game too. For me it’s all about enjoyment. If you’re not enjoying it why are you doing it?’ 

Homegrown: Sheffield-born Joe Root has gone on to be a key player for England 

All-rounder: Gary Ballance is another player from the county to break into the international set-up 

It is an ethos that has seen Yorkshire achieve that elusive balance of competing for trophies while recognising their duty to give opportunities to young English players.

Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett, rejuvenated after his move from Durham, have all played for England this season while openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees and leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid head the queue of those who could join them.

Jonathan Bairstow, meanwhile, has recovered from a nightmare winter in Australia to provide hope that he too could once again represent his country. And this summer’s England Under 19 team included five Yorkshiremen.

‘We’re always keen to give our young lads a crack as often as possible,’ said Gillespie, who is quick to credit the role of director of cricket Martyn Moxon and his support staff for Yorkshire’s rise. ‘I’m a big believer in if they’re good enough they’re old enough. I like to drip feed the young lads into first-team cricket. 

Prospect: Opener Adam Lyth has become a key player for Yorkshire 

‘As a county we do have a duty to produce as many players for England as we can. At the same time this county is ambitious and wants to win trophies, absolutely. So it’s finding that balance. All counties want to win but we all have to look at the bigger picture.’

The bigger picture for Gillespie is trying to ensure that the likes of Lyth, Rashid and Lees, considered by England to be the best prospect of the lot, join Root and Ballance in competing for the Ashes next summer.

Surely that would provide divided loyalties? ‘No question I’d be proud if these guys line up against the Aussies next year,’ said a man who took 259 Test wickets for Australia and hit a Test double hundred. ‘First and foremost I’m the coach of Yorkshire and part of my job is to help my players represent England. I’ll be absolutely chuffed if they are there and I’ll be supporting them.

‘Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and that will never change. Last time in the Ashes there were a few Yorkies playing and I was really hoping they’d do well as well as wanting my country to do well. It can be a tough one but my priority is seeing Yorkshire players succeed.’ 

Front foot: Youngster Alex Lees has piled on the runs in 2014 

Comeback: Spin king Adil Rashid could return to the England set-up for the first time in five years 

Yorkshire’s biggest problem may be keeping hold of their 39-year-old coach. Gillespie has already been sounded out by Darren Lehmann for a role within Australia’s set-up, without success, while Michael Vaughan, for one, believes he could be the next England coach.

For now Gillespie is very happy as an adopted Yorkshireman and his wife and four children are settled in Leeds. ‘It’s a fantastic job, a dream job, at a big club with lots of challenges,’ he said. ‘I like to think I’ve got a good rapport with everyone I work with and I love working with this group of lads.

‘I’ll never quite get the accent but my kids are all talking like Yorkshiremen. My four-year-old boy just sounds like one and my older two have both got the twang. There’s no hope of my two-year-old daughter having an Aussie accent whatsoever!

‘Look, we’re very happy here and I feel I owe the club. They took a bit of a punt on me. I’d done some coaching in Zimbabwe but my CV wasn’t strong and I’m thankful for the opportunity to repay their faith. I just want to help them achieve their goals.’

Victory over Notts this week would be the perfect start.
