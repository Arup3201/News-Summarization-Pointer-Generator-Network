The most popular boys' name in England and Wales last year was Muhammad, according to an ONS poll released earlier today.

The research officially lists Oliver as the most popular boys name, with 6,949 counts, but the way the names are organised means each different spelling of Muhammad is listed separately.

When all the variations are added together, including Muhammad, Mohammed and Mohammad, the name comes out top with 7,445 counts.

Oliver replaced Harry as the second most popular name given to baby boys, while George jumped up to tenth place.
