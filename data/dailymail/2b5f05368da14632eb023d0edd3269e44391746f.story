An ageing mobster who first gained notoriety for helping steal a 45-carat diamond in 1980 has been convicted of being part of  planned robberies.

Arthur 'The Brain' Rachel, 73, of Chicago, Illinois, grimaced as he was found guilty in a bench trial on three of four racketeering counts.

He was known for being in a notorious gang 32 years ago who stole the Marlborough Diamond from the posh Graff jewellery store in London.

In court: The Chicago trial, which was not connected to the jewellery theft, attracted attention partly because of the defendants' advanced ages

Co-defendants and fellow Chicago mobsters Joseph ‘The Monk' Scalise, 74, and Robert Pullia, 70, pleaded guilty in court last week.

Scalise was an accomplice with Rachel in the daring daytime theft of the Marlborough Diamond in London, which was never recovered.

The Chicago trial, which was not connected to the jewellery theft, attracted attention partly because of the defendants' advanced ages.

But prosecutor Amarjeet Bhachu told reporters after Thursday's verdict that the men were far from harmless, elderly goofs.

'You don't need to be a weightlifter to pull the trigger on a firearm,’ he said. 'These men were dedicated to hurting other people.

‘The fact that they were old wasn't a barrier to the crimes.' Rachel, who was acquitted on a lone weapons charge, said nothing outside court.

The judge set a sentencing date of May 30 for Rachel and he is expected to get a prison term of 10 years.

The would-be robbers allegedly intended to use a stepladder in the 2010 burglary at the home of late Chicago mobster Angelo 'The Hook' LaPietra.

Sparkling: They robbed $3.6million worth of goods, including the Marlborough Diamond, pictured, and began serving 15-year prison terms in 1984

Authorities arrested the senior citizens, dressed in black, outside the house. They had also planned to rob an armoured car, prosecutors said.

Scalise and Rachel were convicted in Britain of using a hand grenade as a threat in 1980 to rob London's posh Graff Jewelers.

They robbed $3.6million worth of goods, including the diamond, and began serving 15-year prison terms in 1984. They were released in 1993.

The FBI said Scalise was a technical adviser on the film 'Public Enemies' about Depression Era gangster John Dillinger, filmed in Chicago in 2008.

Last week he was asked if the Marlborough Diamond will ever be located. ‘If Lloyd's wanted to pay enough money, maybe they could,’ Scalise said.
