Harlequins star Danny Care has revealed his disappointment at being left out of the England squad for wins against Samoa and Australia, despite sharing a laugh with head coach Stuart Lancaster.

The scrum-half was told by Lancaster that he would be making some changes for the clash against Samoa before England lost 31-28 to South Africa.

Care won his 50th cap in that defeat but was then sent back to his club as Richard Wigglesworth was drafted in.

The 27-year-old is now fighting for his international place, although he did manage to see the funny side of things after becoming a casualty of Lancaster's shake-up.

Speaking to The Sun, Care said: 'I thought "fair enough", but I didn't expect to go from No 1 to No 3 overnight.

'When Richard Wigglesworth arrived, I was dispatched back to my club - and yes I was disappointed.

'But I also remember talking to Stuart when he announced his plans for scrum-half, laughing out loud.

'When he asked me what I found amusing, I suggested that if we beat Samoa, as we did, he'd find it difficult to change the team again and would not bring me back.

'Stuart and I then both began laughing because the logic was there and he wasn't going to dispute it.'
