A football fan 'bent it like Beckham' when he ran onto the pitch and took a free kick during West Ham United against Tottenham Hotspur earlier this month, according to the judge in the case.

Jordan Dunn, 22, from Dover in Kent, became an internet sensation after he kicked the ball towards the goal West Ham were defending at Upton Park against Tottenham last month.

His shot was saved by West Ham's Spanish goalkeeper Adrian San Miguel del Castillo while the fan was chased by a steward amid cheers from the crowd on August 16.

Charge: Jordan Dunn arrives at court before being charged under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act

On Tuesday 
he apologised for a 'moment of madness' as he pleaded guilty to a charge
 under Section 4 of the Football Offences Act 1991, which states that it
 is an offence to go on to the playing area without lawful authority or 
excuse.

He was fined a total of £305 but spared a ban from attending future matches.

Passing
 sentence at Thames Magistrates' Court in East London, District Judge 
Gareth Branston said: 'On the afternoon of August 16 about 35,000 
football fans sat down at Upton Park to watch 22 men in shorts and 
football boots kick a football around for 90 minutes.

'Those 22 men were paid for that, to entertain.

'Some time into that game a young man ... ran onto the pitch. That was you. You weren't paid to do that.'

The
 judge said he proceeded to run 'some 70 yards' across the pitch, chased
 by stewards - one of whom fell over - before arriving at the spot where
 Tottenham were lining up a free kick.

The judge said: 'You took it for them. To be frank you were probably a little tired by the time you got to the ball.

'It was a longer run than was strictly necessary.

'You had consumed alcohol and your stride pattern was a bit out of kilter but to borrow a phrase you did bend it like Beckham.

'Regrettably it was about 30mph slower than Beckham.'

The
 judge said the effort was 'easily' saved by the West Ham goalkeeper but
 referred to Christian Eriksen's subsequent effort after play restarted,
 saying: 'I understand that the professional footballer who followed you
 did not do any better.'

Judge Branston said the shot drew 'the cheers of the crowd' before he was tackled 'in the customary manner' by stewards.

He also said it was a 'small mercy' that Dunn had 'decided to remain fully clothed'.

Dunn,
 who smiled as the judge compared his effort to the former England 
captain, told police it had been a dream of his to play at the home of 
his favourite team West Ham from a young age.

The
 judge said: 'You told the police and you tell this court that having 
achieved your childhood ambition you won't be doing it again.

'Others
 need to be deterred from attempting to do what you did otherwise 
football matches would become very tedious affairs if everyone was 
allowed to run onto the pitch.'

The
 judge said a greater risk was that 'drunken hooligans' may invade the 
pitch and attack players though he said he accepted that Dunn had 'no 
violent motivation'.

He said he could not condone the offence but must also put it into perspective.

The
 judge declined to impose a football banning order called for by the 
prosecution, saying he was taking into account Dunn's previous good 
character, his 'motivations' on the day, the remorse he expressed and 
the fact that 'you will not want disappoint your young son' by repeating
 the stunt.

Dunn
 told police in interview he had been a West Ham fan since he was a 
little boy and it had always been one of his dreams to 'run on the pitch
 and kick the ball', the court heard.

Ben
 Edwards, prosecuting, added: 'Now he could say he had done it. He also 
said now he had done what he wanted to do he is not going to do it 
again.'

Earlier
 Dunn told the judge he was 'sorry' for committing the offence and 
admitted he had drunk around six beers before the match but denied being
 a 'hooligan', 'thug' or 'yob'.

Asked
 what was going through his mind, Dunn said: 'Nothing really - it was 
just a moment of madness. It was a spur of the moment thing. I just 
went.'

The judge said he had seen footage of the incident on YouTube and asked: 'Were you intending to take the free kick?'

Dunn
 replied: 'No. All I was going to do was run and as I was running I just
 saw the ball there so I thought I would just kick it.'

Dunn, who works as a receptionist at a hotel, said he has a ten-month old little boy.

Referring
 to the prospect of a banning order, he said: 'I was a bit concerned 
that when my little boy grows up I want to take him to watch the 
football.'

The judge asked if his mother had 'expressed disapproval'.

Dunn,
 who represented himself, said: 'At first she was concerned because she 
didn't know the consequences but when she saw the YouTube video she saw 
the funny side but she has had a go at me, as a mother would.'

He declined to comment after the hearing.

The
 pitch invasion provoked amusement on social media, with one fan saying 
the effort was better than Spurs star Eriksen's free kick once play had 
resumed.

He
 wrote on Twitter: 'Fair play to that pitch invader at West Ham v 
Spurs.. He got the Free kick on target when Eriksen couldn't.'
