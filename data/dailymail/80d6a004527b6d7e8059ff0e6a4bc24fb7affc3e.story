Santi Cazorla is used to controlling games from midfield for Arsenal with his tenacious passing, sublime touches and an eye for a goal.

But it appears that the Spain international does not enjoy having things any other way, judging by a post on his Instagram account.

An image of the Arsenal attacking midfielder having his hair cut with the amusing caption 'I'm NOT managing this situation!' appeared on Thursday.

Cazorla played the full 90 minutes in Arsenal's 2-1 victory against Queens Park Rangers on Wednesday, as Arsene Wenger's side battled hard for three points that keeps their Champions League ambitions on course. 

Next up for the Gunners is the FA Cup quarter-final tie against Manchester United at Old Trafford on Monday.

Their Premier League campaign resumes the following weekend, on March 14, against West Ham United at the Emirates.
