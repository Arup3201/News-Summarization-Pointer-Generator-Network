Real Madrid have been warned to not expect an easy ride when they compete in this month's Club World Cup, by 1978  World Cup-winning Argentina coach Cesar Luis Menotti.

The Spanish giants are the heavy tournament favourites, with the Champions League holders currently on a 19-game winning streak in all competitions.

Real, who also won the Copa del Rey this calender year, are five matches short of the world record of 24 successive victories, set by Brazilian side Coritiba in 2011.

Despite boasting an array of talent, including current Ballon d'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo, Menotti believes Carlo Ancelotti's squad shouldn't expect to stroll their way through to silverware at the Club World Cup - which will be held in Morocco.

'Real Madrid cannot afford to think of the Club World Cup as a joke,' he wrote in his column for DPA.

'There has been a history of surprises in the tournament, so I do not think it's going to be a walkover for them against the other teams.'

The reigning European champions will face either North American representatives Cruz Azul or Asian entrants Western Sydney Wanderers in the semi-finals on December 16.

The victor of that clash will face either Oceanic side Auckland City, CAF champions ES Setif or Copa Libertadores winners San Lorenzo in the tournament decider four days later.

Traditionally European sides have been successful in the tournament with Bayern Munich winning the competition last season, although Chelsea suffered a shock 1-0 defeat to Corinthians in the showpiece event 12 months prior.
