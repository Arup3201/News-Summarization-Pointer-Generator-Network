A high-interest loan company came under fire today after openly displaying sensitive customer data to people passing by their office windows.

Dozens of staff were photographed sat with their backs to the frontage of the Amigo Loans office in Bournemouth, Dorset, reviewing customer information on computer screens that face a busy street.

On view at the premises were customers’ names, addresses, contact details and the amount left on their loans - and outraged customers have slammed Amigo Loans for being 'disrespectful’.

Displayed: On view at the premises were customers' names, addresses, contact details and the amount left on their loans - and outraged customers have slammed Amigo Loans for being 'disrespectful' to people

The company, which lends up to £5,000 at 49.9 per cent interest, said it had just moved to the office and was in the process of having its front windows frosted.

A concerned passer-by raised the alarm fearing a breach of data protection laws after spotting the sensitive information on clear view from the pavement.

She said: ‘Their windows are floor to ceiling and they have made no effort to disguise the data with privacy screens or blinds. I think this is an obvious breach of the Data Protection Act.

‘And (it) is an unbelievable act of disrespect to the people’s data. The situation is worse during the evening dark hours. If they just removed or turned that row of computers to face the other way, it would be fine.’

Amigo Loans, a company providing guarantor-backed credit, was set up in Bournemouth in 2005 by entrepreneur James Benamor and has since lent money to 100,000 customers.

Passer-by

Mr Benamor featured on Channel 4’s Secret Millionaire programme in 2008 and is said to be worth £220million. Amigo Loans’ website says it does not judge customers on their credit score, instead relying on friends or family to guarantee loan repayments.

The company employs 280 staff and recently took out a 14-year lease on the office, the former site of a C&A shop.

The office boasts a coffee shop, a restaurant, on-site masseurs and hairdressers plus ‘sleep pods’ where staff are encouraged to take a 20-minute nap.

A spokesman for the company said: ‘We’ve 
just moved in to the building and a lot of work is still going on as we 
continue to make it the best place to work Bournemouth.

'Some of the windows have already been frosted, with more being done next week. We’re a very open company and passers-by can see us at work'

Amigo Loans spokesman

‘Some of the windows have already been frosted, with more being done next week. We’re a very open company and passers-by can see us at work. Some computers can be seen from the window.

‘But no sensitive information can be seen by the naked eye and we’re keeping vigil for anyone with paparazzi-style telescopic lenses until all our windows are finished.

'We welcome any visitors interested in what we do. We’re keen to make finance more social which fits with our old-fashioned values.’

The Data Protection Act says companies must take appropriate measures to protect personal information.
