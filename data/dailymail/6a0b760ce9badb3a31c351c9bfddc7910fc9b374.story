Sure, it's been a positive few days with England effectively securing their place at the 2016 European Championships thanks to that exciting win in Switzerland.

But really the international breaks serve only to highlight how brilliant the Premier League is and how much we miss it when it isn't there.

Here's 10 reasons why Sportsmail can't wait for top flight club football to return this weekend.

1. Saturday summit meeting

There will be no easing back into the Premier League action on Saturday as Arsenal and Manchester City meet in an early clash of the title contenders.

These are the kind of mouth-watering, high-stakes encounters that a Euro 2016 qualifying campaign simply can't offer.

Arsene Wenger will likely hand £16m signing Danny Welbeck his Gunners debut, no doubt encouraged by the two goals he scored for England out in Basel on Monday.

Man City also have a point to prove after their surprise home defeat to Stoke City last time out and will have all guns blazing at the Emirates.

2. First glimpse of the Gaal-acticos

The international pause came at the wrong moment for Man United fans, who are drooling at the prospect of seeing expensive new boys Angel di Maria and Radamel Falcao on the pitch.

They'll get their chance at Old Trafford on Sunday and QPR must be fearing a drubbing despite United's lacklustre start to the campaign.

In addition to  £6m loanee Falcao, we could see debuts for Daley Blind, Luke Shaw and Marcos Rojo on Sunday as Louis van Gaal tries to inject life into United's campaign.

And trying to contain them all in the QPR defence will be Rio Ferdinand, who is sure to get a nice reception on his Old Trafford return.

3. Clash of the in-form sides

Everyone expected Chelsea to make a bright start to the season but few could have predicted their home match with Swansea would be a top-of-the-table affair.

The Welsh side have started impressively, with the wins over Man United, Burnley and West Brom constituting their best winning run in the Premier League.

Chelsea were at their free-scoring best in the 6-3 win at Everton and Diego Costa has adapted to life in England effortlessly.

He is an injury doubt for the Swansea match, however, so we could see a Chelsea debut for deadline day signing Loic Remy.

Predator: Diego Costa may be in the line to start up front for Chelsea but the striker remains an injury doubt

Be prepared: We could see a Chelsea debut for deadline day signing Loic Remy if Costa is on the sidelines

4. Balotelli's Anfield bow

Liverpool fans have already taken Mario Balotelli to their hearts and he'll make his home debut against Aston Villa on Saturday evening.

The madcap Italian has pledged to score a load of goals to carry Liverpool to a long-overdue Premier League title and the team showed their capabilities in a 3-0 win at Tottenham last time.

Adam Lallana, who at £25m was Liverpool's most expensive summer acquisition, may also make his debut after recovering from a knee injury suffered in pre-season.

But Villa, who have started the season unbeaten, will certainly not be cowed as they aim to push on.

5. Spurs with a point to prove

They started the Mauricio Pochettino era in superb style, winning London derbies against West Ham and QPR.

But Spurs were left questioning their top four credentials after Liverpool smashed them 3-0.

Having stewed over that result for a fortnight, they finally have the chance to make amends up at Sunderland on Saturday, who are still searching for their first win.

6. A legend at Leicester

Newly-promoted Leicester certainly raised a few eyebrows with their pursuit of Argentine legend Esteban Cambiasso over the summer.

And the former Real Madrid and Inter Milan midfielder may make his debut in Saturday's match away to Stoke.

Leicester were a match for Arsenal in their last fixture, while Stoke were shock winners away to Man City, so both enter in a good frame of mind.

Fighters: Leicester proved a good match for Arsenal in their last fixture and will hope for more of the same

7. Basement battle

It's a little too soon to be talking about six-pointers, but Saturday's meeting of the bottom two - Crystal Palace and Burnley - has that 'must-win' feel for both.

Palace twice surrendered the lead against Newcastle before Wilfried Zaha earned a point in Neil Warnock's first game in charge and the new boss will return to the Selhurst Park touchline on Saturday.

Burnley, who gained their first point against Man United last time out, were busy on deadline day and we could see debuts for £3m striker George Boyd as well as young loanees Nathaniel Chalobah and Michael Keane.

8. Life goes on for Saints

Many feared for them after the summer exodus of their best players but Southampton have started encouragingly and will be looking for more gains when they host Newcastle on Saturday.

The Saints picked up their first Premier League win of the Ronald Koeman era when they beat West Ham 3-1, with new boy Graziano Pelle opening his account.

Newcastle, who are still waiting for their first three points, are hopeful 'ginger Pirlo' Jack Colback will be back from the injury that denied him a senior England debut.

They certainly will be aiming to do better than the 4-0 drubbing they were dealt in this fixture back in March.

Fit? Newcastle await their first three points and hope 'ginger Pirlo' Jack Colback will be back from the injury

9. Toffees hoping to kick-start season

Watching Everton has certainly not been dull so far this season, with 17 goals scored in their three matches so far. Unfortunately, the majority have gone against them.

But with Steven Naismith in brilliant form and Samuel Eto'o opening his account against former club Chelsea last time out, there have been some positives for Roberto Martinez.

They will chase a first league win at West Brom on Saturday, who have an identical record so far.

Alan Irvine is optimistic that some of his new signings will feature at The Hawthorns, including striker Georgios Samaras.

Revenge: Samuel Eto'o's header caused Chelsea problems at Goodison Park and it opened his account

Deal: Everton boss Roberto Martinez is chasing his first  win and hopes Eto'o will help against West Brom

10. Tigers' new boys set to roar

Steve Bruce proclaimed Hull's deadline day business as 'fantastic' and now fans will get the chance to see the new boys in action - albeit having waited until Monday night.

The Tigers took Newcastle's Hatem Ben Arfa on loan and smashed their club record to sign £10m Abel Hernandez.

Mohamed Diame, another newcomer, will see plenty of familiar faces when they welcome West Ham, while ex-Southampton man Gaston Ramirez could also feature.

West Ham will likely include Barcelona loanee Alex Song in their line-up, likewise new signing from Marseille Morgan Amalfitano.

Glad to escape: Hatem Ben Arfa could get his chance to pull on the Hull shirt against West Ham at home
