Liverpool are on the brink of concluding a £20million deal to make Dejan Lovren the most expensive defender in their history.

Brendan Rodgers has been pursuing the Croatia international all summer and though Southampton - who have already sold Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert to Liverpool - were reluctant to do business there has been resolution; the transfer will take Liverpool’s summer spending past £80m.

And the Anfield club are set to further boost their ranks - by concluding the £8.5m signing of striker Loic Remy over the weekend.

Glen Johnson - £18million (from Portsmouth)

Tiago Ilroi - £8million (from Sporting Lisbon)

Andrea Dossena - £8million (from Udinese)

Martin Skrtel - £6million (from Zenit) 

Liverpool have refused to comment about 
where they stand on Lovren but it is expected he will complete a medical
 on Saturday, which will most likely be staged on Merseyside.

He is unlikely to join up with his new team-mates on their tour of the United States.

Lovren’s fee will outstrip the £18million paid for Mamadou Sakho (2013) and Glen Johnson (2009) but, more than anything, it will give Rodgers the commanding central defender he has been looking for since Liverpool conceded 51 goals in the Barclays Premier League last season.

The defender played all three matches for Croatia during the World Cup group stages.

He made 32 appearances for Southampton last season, scoring three goals. 

Loic Remy’s protracted £8.5million move from Queens Park Rangers should also be finally made official over the weekend.

The Frenchman completed his medical in Boston but the announcement has been delayed owing to administrative issues.

Red alert! The Croatia defender represented his nation in Brazil during the 2014 World Cup

Moving on: Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana are two of the players to have left Southampton so far
