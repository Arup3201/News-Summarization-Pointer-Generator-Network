Manchester United youngster RoShaun Williams has broken a 25-year-old school sprinting record set by Olympic gold medallist Darren Campbell.

Williams, just 15, ran the 100m in 10.99 seconds, breaking Campbell's Ashton-on-Mersey School record of 11.13 seconds, which was set way back in 1989.

Campbell went on to win gold for Great Britain in the 4x100m relay at the 2004 Olympics in Athens and Williams has aspirations of being a professional sportsman himself.

He has been on United's books since the age of nine and wants to force his way into the first team - and represent England too.

Speaking about his record run, Williams told the Manchester Evening News: 'I didn't know I had beaten the record until the next day at school when my teacher told me.

'It was just a school sports day so we all had to run.'

After seeing his 25-year-old record smashed, Campbell said: 'I've always said anyone who can run under 11 seconds has got a lot of natural speed, it shows that he's got massive ability. I wish him all the best.'

Despite his sprinting prowess, Williams is fully focused on carving a career for himself in the professional game - especially after watching seeing Ryan Giggs become caretaker manager at the end of last season.

He added: 'Ryan Giggs is my hero I suppose because he has stayed with the club, and when he was acting manager he gave young players a chance.'

Dreams: Williams is aiming to become a regular for Manchester United and England

Hero: Williams is a huge fan of United assistant manager and former player Ryan Giggs
