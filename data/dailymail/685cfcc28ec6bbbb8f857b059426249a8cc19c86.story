Tax inspectors were last night accused of ‘turning a blind eye’ to controversial payroll practices at the BBC .

MPs on all sides called for a crackdown following revelations that thousands of the broadcaster’s staff – including dozens of well-known presenters – are employed through personal service companies.

The arrangement allows them to minimise their tax bills and potentially saves the BBC millions in national insurance contributions.

But MPs said it was immoral for a publicly funded organisation to encourage practices designed to minimise tax.

Tory David Mowat, whose freedom of information request revealed that more than 3,000 BBC staff were paid in this way, said a Government crackdown on similar arrangements in the public sector should be extended to the corporation.

MPs heard this week that 148 of the BBC’s 467 presenters were paid ‘off the books’. The list is thought to include Jeremy Paxman and Fiona Bruce.

Mr Mowat said: ‘The BBC is our national broadcaster and, as such, should be particularly diligent in not pushing the boundaries on this sort of thing. We have to assume that these arrangements are legal, but they are certainly not acceptable.’

HM Revenue and Customs was facing questions after figures revealed it had all but abandoned enforcement of laws designed to prevent the misuse of personal service companies.

Last year tax inspectors launched 23 investigations into breaches of the rules, down from more than 1,000 a year a decade ago.

Reacting to the furore, HMRC last night said it planned a tenfold increase in enforcement of laws governing ‘disguised employment’ in the coming year.

But Margaret Hodge, Labour chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, said the figures suggested a ‘worrying lack of vigilance’.

Stephen Barclay, a Tory member of the committee, said HMRC appeared to have been ‘turning a blind eye’.

He also questioned why the BBC was refusing to name the stars involved. ‘It is quite remarkable that people who are the face of the BBC, and who have been working there for years, are not employed by the corporation,’ he said.

‘If it is all legitimate, as we are told it is, then why all the secrecy? Why are people embarrassed about it if it is the right thing to do?’

The row follows an explosive hearing at the public accounts committee on Monday when the BBC’s finance chief Zarin Patel was grilled by MPs over the corporation’s employment practices.

Miss Patel insisted the arrangements were standard industry practice. But Mrs Hodge said a whistleblower had told the committee that the BBC was now forcing some freelance staff to set up personal service companies, telling them they were unlikely to be investigated by HMRC, a suggestion rejected by Miss Patel.

Yesterday the BBC said it was ‘satisfied’ its payment arrangements were ‘appropriate and in line with HMRC guidelines’, adding: ‘However, in view of the select committee’s interest in this area, we will undertake a review of the detail of these arrangements and report back to the committee.’
