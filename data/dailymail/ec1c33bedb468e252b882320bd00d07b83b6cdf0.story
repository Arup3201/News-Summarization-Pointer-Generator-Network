A 13-year-old boy collapsed and died after a suspected asthma attack in his classroom, following a rugby game on his second day at a new school.

Hannan Ahmed, of Batley, West Yorkshire, suffered the attack in lessons at Mirfield Free Grammar School, where he only started the day before.

The year-nine pupil was taken to Dewsbury and District Hospital and put on a life support machine, but he died in the early hours of last Thursday.

Hannan, who had previously studied at Batley Business and Enterprise College, was playing rugby before the suspected attack last Wednesday.

Lorraine Baker, Hannan’s headteacher at his new school in Mirfield, said staff had done ‘everything we could until the paramedics arrived’.

She added: ‘He was not alone. I express my sincere condolences and the school’s extreme sadness about such an unexpected death.’

His former headmaster Ian Dutton said that Hannan loved playing football and was a ‘real pleasure to be with’.

Mr Dutton added: ‘We will always remember Hannan with his wide smile, his engaging conversation and his passion for enjoying life.’

Hannan had studied at the Madressah Hira mosque in nearby Staincliffe since the age of five and staff there described him as ‘a bubbly child’.

'He was a child who respected everybody. He was always there for everybody so it’s a big loss. He was like one of our own children here'
