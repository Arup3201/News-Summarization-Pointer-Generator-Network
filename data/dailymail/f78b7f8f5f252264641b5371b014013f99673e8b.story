An island believed to be of the world's most haunted locations has been sold at auction for more than £400,000.

Poveglia Island, in the Venetian Lagoon, Italy, is surrounded by a number of spine-chilling legends and is described by locals as the 'most haunted place on Earth.'

The 18-acre plot of land was once a quarantine station for people with infectious disease and a mass burial ground for plague victims who were sent there to be burned.

According to historical estimates as many as 150,000 people died on the island

Later, in the 1920s, a mental hospital opened on the island where local legend has it a crazy doctor conducted experiments on patients residing there, before later jumping out of the asylum's bell tower.

An Italian businessman, Luigi Brugnaro, won the auction, which will allow him to lease the picturesque location for 99 years.

Brugarno's spokesman said he has not yet decided what he will do with the island but wants it to have some form of public use.

It is estimated the restoration of the island's derelict buildings will cost around £16.25 million.

Cash-strapped Italy is selling off the land, which has also been dubbed the real-life Shutter Island, as well as four other pieces of prime real estate

Cash-strapped
 Italy is selling off the land, which has also been dubbed the real-life
 Shutter Island, as well as four other pieces of prime real estate.

The state agency, who are handling the auction, now have 30 days to either accept or turn down the highest offer.

Very
 few people have set foot on the island since the 1960s, but 
photographer Mike Deere, from Reading, Berks, paid a local fishing 
captain a fee to take him there.

The
 captain refused to set foot on the island and said he would not wait 
for Mike - instead promising that to return a few hours later.

This
 gave Mr Deere enough time to quickly snap the haunted island, where 
according to historical estimates, as many as 150,000 people died.

He
 said: 'The locals are very hesitant, almost surprised, when you mention
 Poveglia to them - it took several days to track down someone who would
 be willing to take us to there, and not for a cheap price.

'Beyond the initial landing point, the natural decay has an unrivalled purity to it that I've never seen anywhere else. 'I'm not going to forget the soil composition of the burning grounds in a hurry,' said Mr Deere

'It's history aside, the overwhelming feeling I experienced during my time there was actually one of peace and serenity - it was a very quiet place,' said Mr Deere

'When we reached the island our captain refused to set foot on Poveglia, instead opting to leave and then return in a few hours' time to pick us up. 'Venetians describe it as the most haunted place on Earth.

'I've been to a lot of derelict buildings, somewhere approaching the 500 mark, but Poveglia struck me for a couple of reasons.

'Beyond the initial landing point, the natural decay has an unrivalled purity to it that I've never seen anywhere else.

'I'm not going to forget the soil composition of the burning grounds in a hurry.

'But its history aside, the overwhelming feeling I experienced during my time there was actually one of peace and serenity - it was a very quiet place..'
