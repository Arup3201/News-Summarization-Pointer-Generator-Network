Forty per cent of Republicans in Iowa agree with potential presidential candidate Mike Huckabee's claims that singer Beyonce's music is 'mental poison'- according to a poll.

The former host of the eponymous Fox News Channel show Huckabee had criticized the Single Ladies singer in his latest book - God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.

He described Beyonce's music as 'obnoxious and toxic mental poison in the form of song lyrics' and her dance moves as 'best left for the privacy of her bedroom.'

After watching her performance of Drunk in Love with husband Jay Z on the Grammys, the potential presidential candidate added that the rapper was 'arguably crossing the line from husband to pimp by exploiting his wife as a sex object'.

And it appears he's not alone in his controversial views. 

A new poll by Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register Iowa found that 40 per cent of Iowa Republican caucus-goers - a conservative branch of the party - agreed with his characterization as 'mental poison'. While 38 per cent said Huckabee went too far and 22 per cent were unsure.

There was also a gender divide in responses with Republican men  more likely to side with Huckabee as  45 per cent agreed to the statement compared with 32 per cent of  women agreed.

In an interview with People magazine published in January, Huckabee went on to criticize the Obamas for allowing their daughters to listen to the singer.

'I don't understand how on one hand they can be such doting parents and so careful about the intake of everything—how much broccoli they eat and where they go to school…and yet they don't see anything that might not be suitable,' he told the magazine.

But this time, the poll results suggested Huckabee, who served as the 44th Governor of Arkansas, had crossed a line by suggesting President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama were bad parents.

More than 60 per cent of Republican caucus-goers and a whopping 95 percent of likely Democratic caucus-goers said Huckabee, 'went too far' in his comments, with just 23 percent of Republicans and 2 percent of Democrats agreeing he was 'mostly right.' The rest were unsure. 

Huckabee even went on criticize the Obamas for allowing their daughters to listen to the singer
