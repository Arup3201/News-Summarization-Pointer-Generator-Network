It's one of the most prestigious addresses in the world, but in the 1890s, living on Pennsylvania Avenue meant a whole different type of neighbor was expected.

This extraordinary map, held by the Library of Congress, shows the 50 'saloons' and 108 'bawdy-houses' (or brothels) within sight of the White House, in the so-called Murder Bay neighborhood.

It is taken from a newspaper clipping from the 1890s, Presidents Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland and William McKinley were in the Oval Office, without a known author or publisher, The Slate reported.

The area was known as the Hooker's Division, where the Civil War soldiers responsible for the defense of Washington under the command of General Joseph Hooker once sought R&R in their off-duty hours.

Decades later the area still hadn't shaken its bad reputation.

Within sight of the White House: The section of Washington, D.C., known as 'Hooker's Division', which contains 50 saloons and 109 bawdy-houses--list of 61 places where liquor is sold with government but without city licenses

The unknown author anotates the map with an explanation of how 109 houses of prostitution were allowed to thrive so near the White House.

He says: 'Grover Cleveland can sit in his bedroom window at the White house and survey the entire territory. He is within sight and gunshot of each of these 109 dens which defy the law which he is supposed to execute through his commisssioners.'

The author then gives a list of 61 people he accuses of selling liquor in them without paying the $400 "High-License".

The mapmaker takes special care to mention legitimate businesses newspapers, theaters, churches, hotels around the neighborhood. On the map, each of these has a number, while saloons and 'bagnios' (an archaic term for 'brothel') are dark gray and gray, respectively.

Through showing the close proximity of these establishments, the author shames those respectable Washingtonians who, like President Grover Cleveland, ignored the presence of sinners in their midst.
