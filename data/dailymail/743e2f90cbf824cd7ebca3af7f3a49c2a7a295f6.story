The stars were out in force for the launch of Vivienne Westwood's new collection in London last night.

But this catwalk show reached new heights of fashion - involving her new uniform designs for Virgin Atlantic.

The British icon has unveiled her red hot pieces for the Sir Richard Branson-owned airline, in the company of Mark Ronson, Matt Smith and Bond girl Naomi Harris.

The
 designer was also out to showcase her new collection, wearing a trademark quirky outfit matched with black lipstick and her pixie hairdo.

The designer, who announced her partnership with Virgin last year, 
joined Sir Richard on stage to present the updated uniforms which were made using a polyester made 
from recycled plastic bottles and took inspiration from some of her most
 iconic pieces.

The re-imagined red jacket is inspired by the 'Bettina' jacket designed in the early 90s with a matching red pencil skirt, which has a cheeky dart to the rear.

The hand drawn wing designs are a recurring theme across all members of the team while a new addition of bags for ground staff has also been introduced by the Ethical Fashion Initiative in Nairobi in collaboration with the International Trade Centre, United Nations.

 Jacket with nipped in waist and high collar detail creates an elegant, feminine silhouette. Inspired by the Vivienne Westwood ‘Bettina.’

Dramatic asymmetric frill front blouse in tonal ‘wings’ design jacquard fabric.

Pencil skirt with hemline that slopes towards clever back pleat.

Updated red shoe incorporating the iconic Vivienne Westwood hourglass heel. Three heel heights depending on the wearer’s role or service phase.

Double breasted ‘drape coat’ gathers at the waist with an oversized collar to create a feminine silhouette. Worn fastened or open.

Perfectly proportioned red leather bag features classic Vivienne Westwood diamond shape handles.

Westwood’s design references her enduring interest in 40s French couture cutting, with a double breasted ‘drape coat’ for women, and updating the classic red shoe with Westwood’s iconic hourglass heel.

Male crew will be stylish in the skies with a sharp Saville Row inspired three piece suit with a contemporary twist in a deep burgundy Oxford weave wool.

Over 7,500 staff including cabin crew, pilots, Clubhouse staff and Virgin Holidays employees will receive the new uniform consisting of 22 pieces in total, which has been trialled across airports and on board over the past year.

Speaking about the collaboration, Virgin Atlantic said: 'She was the natural choice to redesign the uniform across all areas of our business. Firstly because original design and sustainability are vital to both Virgin Atlantic and Vivienne Westwood.

'And this long term partnership brings those ideals together in an exciting and innovative collaboration.'

The airline added: 'Vivienne was also the original ‘punk’ designer, sharing the  pioneering, maverick spirit that Virgin Atlantic is famous for. And most importantly, along with her team, she  creates intelligently cut, beautiful tailoring that makes both men and women feel confident and at their best.'

The new uniform will take to the skies from September 1.
