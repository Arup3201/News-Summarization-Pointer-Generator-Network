'Rethinking': Philip Hammond has revealed UK forces could be withdrawn more quickly from Afghanistan

Philip Hammond has revealed plans to bring back more British troops from Afghanistan as early as next year, well ahead of the existing 2014 timetable.

The Defence Secretary said there was a 'a bit of rethinking' about soldier numbers after military commanders reported that Afghan forces were taking on the 'lion's share' of the combat role.

British forces have shut down 52 of their bases and checkpoints in Helmand over he past six months, leaving just 34 still operating, he said.

Downing Street today backed Mr Hammond, saying David Cameron had already made clear that he wants more troops home in 2013.

But a No 10 spokesman insisted no final decisions have yet been taken.

'The Prime Minister said in July that he was confident that he would be able to reduce troop numbers further next year, following conversations with commanders on the ground,' the spokesman added.

The PM has stressed the need to avoid a 'cliff-edge' on troop withdrawal in 2014, the date when all UK combat troops are due to be out.

But he has insisted the decision should be based on progress by the Afghan security forces.

Mr Hammond admitted British officers had been privately pushing 'for keeping force levels as high as possible for as long as possible' earlier this year.

But military commanders had since been 'surprised by the extent to which they have been able to draw back and leave the Afghans to take the lion's share of the combat role', he added.

In an interview with the Guardian in Camp Bastion, Helmand, he said: 'I think there is a bit of a rethinking going on about how many troops we do actually need...

'There may be some scope for a little bit more flexibility on the way we draw down, and that is something commanders on the ground are looking at very actively.'

Around 500 British troops are due to return home by the end of this year, leaving a further 9,000 to return by the end of 2014.

Mr Hammond added: 'I think that the message I am getting clearly from the military is that it might be possible to draw down further troops in 2013.

'Whereas six months ago the message coming from them was that we really need to hold on to everything we have got for as long as we possibly can. I think they are seeing potentially more flexibility in the situation.

'Talking to senior commanders you get a clear sense that their view of force levels is evolving in light of their experiences.'

The Defence Secretary insisted Britain would not be 'spooked' by the run of 'green on blue' attacks - when Afghans turn on international troops.

He added: 'We have to be clear why we came here in the first place. I believe very clearly that if we are going to ask British troops to put themselves in the firing line, we can only do that to protect UK vital national security interests.

'We can ask troops who are here to help build a better Afghanistan, but we cannot ask them to expose themselves to risk for those tasks.

'We can only ask them to expose themselves to risk for Britain's national security, which is what they signed up to do.'

In order for their to be resolution to the conflict, Britons would have accept that 'Northern Ireland-style' negotiations would have to be made with at least moderate elements within the Afghan insurgency, he said.

But he said that the Afghan government's diplomatic efforts with insurgents were lagging behind successes in the military campaign.

Mr Hammond also raised concerns about the potential for the unrest that sparked the murder of the U.S. ambassador in Libya to spread to Afghanistan and revealed extra steps had been taken to strengthen security around British bases.
