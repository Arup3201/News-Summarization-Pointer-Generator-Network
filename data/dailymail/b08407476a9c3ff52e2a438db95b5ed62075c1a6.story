Four years ago, Wayne Rooney scored one of the best goals of his career, an overhead kick against Manchester City. For some time afterwards, City captain Vincent Kompany admitted the image of Rooney mid-air was burned on to his retina.

United won the Barclays Premier League that season. Rooney’s return of 16 club goals was modest for him but many of them were important. He scored against Liverpool, Chelsea (twice), Arsenal and in a Champions League semi-final and final against Schalke and Barcelona respectively.

Now, Rooney – the captain of his club and his country – is having to adjust to drastically changed circumstances at Old Trafford and one wonders just how long England’s most celebrated modern centre forward will allow it to last.

Rooney scored 16 goals during the 2010-11 season to help United win the Premier League title

13 - The 29-year-old has just 13 shots on target in 21 league appearances this season. Last season he registered 43 shots on target in 29 appearances.

84.38 - His pass accuracy has increased this season playing in a deeper role.

4 - But only four of his 1,210 passes have set up team-mates for league goals. He has created 30 chances in 21 games, compared to 56 in 29 last season.

The statistics of Rooney’s season are remarkable. He is in the middle of his worst scoring run since 2006 – having scored in just one of his last 11 United games – and has not managed to have a single shot on goal since the turn of the calendar year.

That last statistic is so startling, Rooney himself was stunned to learn of it. But when he looks back at his latest 90 minutes, against Burnley on Wednesday, he will certainly begin to understand it.

Rooney has not always played as a traditional number nine at United. Far from it. He has played left and right and he has played in the fashionable ten position. He has always been a selfless and versatile footballer.

In Louis van Gaal’s team, however, Rooney has been asked to perform a conventional midfield role. On Wednesday – after an injury to Daley Blind – he spent an hour playing in front of his own back four.

It was a staggering and unedifying sight as United’s most potent forward player scuffled about in the cheap seats simply because Van Gaal – by his own subsequent admission – had no one else in his squad he could trust to do it.

In the second half he was booked. Those of us who have watched Rooney over the years recognised the pattern. As his frustration built, he began to niggle at opponents, snipe at the officials. He was eventually cautioned for persistent offending. Classic Rooney.

As always, he did his utmost to drag his team through the game. Up ahead of him, though, the glamour pairing of Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao lumbered through the night like a couple on a rather uncomfortable first date.

They were wooden and inhibited and Van Gaal eventually called time early by hauling Falcao from the field.

Publicly, Rooney has said nothing about his current role. He admires Van Gaal, is impressed by his CV and his thoroughness and clarity.

Be under no illusion, though, this will be irritating the hell out him. Eventually we can expect the dam to burst and if that happens Van Gaal will have a problem to deal with.

Still only 29, Rooney remains ambitious and, more importantly, he still sees himself as a centre forward. He is by all accounts proving to be a much better captain than some at Old Trafford expected, especially away from the field.

Nevertheless, Rooney still has a desperate hunger for goals and glory, both collective and individual.

The longer he remains stuck 25 goals behind Sir Bobby Charlton’s club record of 249 and the longer United remain muddled and detached from genuine league title contention, the greater the risk of disenfranchising the player Van Gaal’s team really should be built around.

The days of English clubs playing two centre forwards – the Toshack/Keegan days - are all but gone. In some ways, coaches have become too sophisticated for their own good.

Rooney understands this but is also self-aware enough to always have one eye on his own future.

After all, when he signed his big new contract in February 2014, he did not do so thinking that only a year later he would be spending his time doing a less than convincing impression of Michael Carrick.
