A cat-crazy couple wanted to ensure that their new kitten felt welcome when they brought him home.

So Mike and Megan, from Michigan, built an assault course-style installation including ropes and a bridge for their new pet, who ended up playing on it constantly.

Little did they realise that this would lead them to open their very own online cat furniture shop, aptly called CatostophiCreations. And their two cats Ickle and Heisenberg quality control all their creations.

When preparing for their first kitten's arrival, the couple wanted to build a 'cat wall' or place where he could feel safe and hang out.

'We were trying to design a cat wall for him to climb and couldn't figure out how to bridge the gap where our hallway was. Then it hit me! We needed a bridge.'

Mike explains that when they could not seem to find one anywhere they decided to build one for themselves.

'Since we were bringing home a kitten, we decided that it was safest to add ropes along the length of it and thus we created the Indiana Jones Cat Bridge.

'Little did we know that Ickle would completely fall in love with his bridge and would be sleeping on it almost every night.'

Mike and his partner started to think about whether other cats would also enjoy using a bridge.

His mother, who has her own shop on Etsy, suggested that they should start up a shop on their own.

'We started adding shelves to match our collection and it just grew from there. Before we built our bridge, we bought several cat trees for our cats to climb on. 

'To us they all looked very similar. People's living rooms don't all look the same, so it seemed silly for them to have cat furniture that all looks the same.'

When they first started the couple built everything in their apartment, and did all of the woodwork and sanding by hand. 

'We have now teamed up with Matt Kindall, a carpenter with over 20 years of wood working experience. Matt helped us make changes to all our items to ensure we were creating quality, safe cat furniture.'

Mike explains that they really want their furniture to stand out and be different, along with being better looking and more functional than other cat furniture.

Their shop offers a water fountain, shelves and even a bridge, and all items are fully customisable

Their online shop offers a range of innovative platforms for cats to sleep, play and relax on, including a 
water fountain, shelves and even a bridge.

All of their items are fully customisable.

'We get so many people coming to us with custom furniture ideas that they have envisioned for their house. Sometimes the ideas are a little too farfetched, but a lot of the time we go ahead and make the pieces.

'We've been lucky enough to have two very cute cats, Ickle and Heisenberg, who are very active and eager to test out our new ideas. When we build a new piece of furniture, they help us decide how fun or functional the piece is. They definitely let us know what does and doesn't work.

'We really couldn't be happier doing anything else, and by no means did we think that we would be where we are now just a little over a year after starting the shop.'
