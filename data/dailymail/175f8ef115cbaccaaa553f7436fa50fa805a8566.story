The long track of a rectangular, tumbling boulder has on Mars has been captured in incredible detail by a space probe.

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) discovered the trail left behind after a SUV-sized rock rolling down a Martian hill.

Analysis of the rock's shadow suggests that the boulder is about 20ft tall (6 metres) and 11.5ft wide (3.5 metres).

The boulder's trail down the slope is about one-third of a mile (about 500 metres) long. The trail has an odd repeating pattern, suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape, according to Nasa

The giant boulder, captured using MRO's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment, ended its roll pointed upright.

Nasa doesn't yet know what dislodged the boulder, but recent speculation suggests it may have been due to a meteor striking one of the larger craters.

'The boulder's trail down the slope is about one-third of a mile (about 500 metres) long,' the space agency said.

'The trail has an odd repeating pattern, suggesting the boulder could not roll straight due to its shape.'

The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter launched in 2005 on a search for evidence that water persisted on the surface of red planet for a long period of time.

In its survey of the red planet, MRO has increased tenfold the number of spots surveyed close-up. 

One of the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's cameras is the largest ever flown on a planetary mission.  While previous cameras on other Mars orbiters could identify objects no smaller than a bus, this camera will be able to spot something as small as a dinner table.

 In October, MRO have a close Mars' close encounters with a comet set to fly by the red planet, giving it a rare opportunity to take images of the space rock.

Comet Siding Spring will pass by Mars only 82,000 miles (132,000 km) which would be the equivalent of a comet passing about a third of the distance between Earth and the moon.

The nucleus of the comet won't hit Mars, but there could be a different kind of collision.

'We hope to witness two atmospheres colliding,' explains David Brain of the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP). 'This is a once in a lifetime event.'
