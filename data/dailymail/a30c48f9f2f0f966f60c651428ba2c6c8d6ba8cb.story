A couple fear they could have been killed when a 1.5 stone slab of frozen human waste fell from a passing plane and plunged into their garden.

Farmer Peter Grey, 72, from Midgham, Berkshire and his wife Barbara says the giant ice block made a nine inch hole in their lawn and landed just 25 yards away from their house, cars and barn.

The couple have lived at the property for 35 years and are positive the unexpected missile came off an aeroplane.

'There is no other feasible explanation. We are west of Heathrow and aircraft do fly over us, from time to time, but not frequently,' said Mr Grey.

'My wife Barbara and I count ourselves so lucky it did not land on our roof or barn. No doubt, this could have killed one of us if we were out in the garden in the wrong place at the wrong time.

'We didn't know what it was at first but it was a big shock. You wonder how many times this must happen.'

A spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority admitted that the ice was probably the result of a 'leak' from a plane - and possibly from the lavatories.

'The ice can also be the result of a leak on the plane either from the toilet facilities, the air conditioning or running water,' said the spokesman.

'These incidents are very rare but they do happen occasionally.

'In comparison to the 2.5 million flights a year in UK airspace, approximately 25 ice falls per year are reported to the CAA. 

'Some of these instances may occur because ice which has naturally formed on an aircraft at higher altitudes breaks off as it descends into warmer air.' 

Over the past 40 years there have been five recorded cases of people being hit by 'waste' ice from plane toilets. 

In May 2013 Caroline Guy, 52, had the roof of her caravan wrecked when a block of ice fell through the ceiling in Pattingham, Staffs.

And in 2009, David Gammon, 76, suffered bruising when a lump of ice the size of a grapefruit landed in his lap as he sat in his garden in Bristol.
