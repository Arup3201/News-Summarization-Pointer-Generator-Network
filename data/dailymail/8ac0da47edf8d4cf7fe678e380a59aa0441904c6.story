A New South Wales company has been forced to settle a tab of more than $10,000 with the ACCC, after it advertised '100 per cent Aussie' beer that was actually made in China. 

The Independent Liquor Group was hit with an infringement notice by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, and had to pay the fine of $10,200 after its green and gold clad beer was falsely advertised. 

Independent Liquor Group was fined for advertising this Chinese brewed beer as 'Aussie beer'

'Aussie Beer' labelling from March 2014 to August 2014 featured a map of Australia with '100 per cent owned' inside it, and the statement 'Australia's finest malt'. 

However, contrary to what its packaging suggested, the beer is made in China.

The ACCC dished out the penalty in accordance with the Australian Consumer Law. 

'Country of origin representations, particularly those designed to grab the eye of the consumer by using well known symbols, colours, or slogans, must be truthful,' ACCC Chairman Rod Sims said.

The ACCC fined the New South Wales company $10,200, in accordance with Australian Consumer Law

'Consumers will often place a premium on the provenance of a product, but are unable to check the accuracy of those claims. This is particularly the case with Australian made products which encourage consumers to support local industries. 

'Consumers are entitled to expect that prominent representations made on packaging are accurate without having to check for disclosures in the fine print.'
