Married BBC presenter Paul Ross has confessed to a gay affair with a man he met at a dogging spot after becoming hooked on the drug meow meow which he snorted off the man's face.

The 57-year-old, who is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross and a father-of-five, has admitted to cheating on his wife of 10 years with former English teacher Barry Olivier.

But despite the affair, Jackie, who married the presenter in 2004, says she is sticking by him, saying she is not ending a 14 year relationship over a 'six months of madness'.

Ross, who is best-known as the breakfast presenter on BBC Radio London and his appearances on ITV's This Morning said he was looking for an escape after facing financial ruin, which led him to look for casual sex on the Internet.

After visiting a dogging site near to the Thicket roundabout in Maidenhead, he then met Mr Olivier, a father-of-four and began an affair, with them regularly meeting up at his flat in the Berkshire town and continuing to take the drug, also known as meow meow.

Paul Ross was born in Leytonstone, east London in 1958 and is best-known as a TV and radio presenter. 

His onscreen break came on current affairs show Eyewitness before appearing on Channel 4's the Big Breakfast.

He has also appeared as a contestant on reality TV shows such as Celebrity Fit Club and celebrity diving show Splash!

Ross is the current co-host of BBC Radio London's breakfast show and appears regularly on ITV's This Morning.

He is the older brother of chat show host Jonathan Ross, who has enjoyed more high profile success and fortunes than his sibling.

He hosted Friday Night With Jonathan Ross on the BBC before joining ITV, where he now presents chat show The Jonathan Ross show.

The older Ross has said he was too proud to ask for help during his financial troubles from his wealthy brother.

Their mother is actress and radio presenter Martha Ross, who worked as an extra on EastEnders.

But her contract was terminated in 2006, when she is said to have told Paul one of the show's Christmas storylines, which leaked on one of his radio shows.

He also has three other brothers and a sister.

Ross told the Sun on Sunday about the first time he tried the drug saying: 'We went back to his . There was some white powder on his kitchen top with some strawa and then he took a couple of hits of this stuff.

'I was on telly in the Eighties and drugs were all around and I never tried them. Anyway, so I tried this stuff and then we had sex and it was just incredibly intense. It was all about the drugs.'

Mr Olivier claims that the presenter, with who he used the pet names Puck and Pea, would often drive to his flat to snort mephedrone and have sex before starting his radio show.

However, Ross has strongly denied taking drugs before presenting the show.

Mrs Ross found out about her husband's affair after tracking down his phone using an app on her iPad and went round to the flat but nobody answered. 

The star then confessed to his wife about his drug used but it was only ten days ago that Mr Olivier got in touch to reveal the full extent of the affair.

But Mrs Ross also told the newspaper: 'I know 90 per cent of Paul is a good man. He's a good dad. I feel the sex was part of the mephedrone package, I don't see it as a gay relationship, I see it as part of the drugs.'

Ross, who co-hosts the BBC Radio London breakfast with Penny Smith, has previously spoken about how his fortunes, which have been rather more mixed than his younger brother Jonathan, which in the most part has been dictated by his relationships.

He has two divorces behind him and five children by his two former wives.

The financial fortunes of Ross, have been rather more mixed than his younger brother, chat show host Jonathan 

In 2011, he spoke about selling his 600-year-old timber-framed property in the village of Bisham, near Marlow, Buckinghamshire, for £579,950

He said at the time: 'We're under no pressure to sell – the next house will probably be our last move so it's got to be right.

'We no longer need so many bedrooms as the girls don't tend to stay all at once any more,' said the presenter, who grew up in Leytonstone, east London, with his five younger siblings, who all work in the media.

The BBC has announced that Ross will not be presenting his show tomorrow morning to 'deal with his issues' and is expected to be off air most of next month.

A spokesman for the BBC said: 'Paul has spoken about his personal problems at length. He will be taking some time off to deal with those issues and won't be on air on Monday.'
