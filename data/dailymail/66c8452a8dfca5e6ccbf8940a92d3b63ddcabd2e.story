Smart phones are so much more than making calls or taking the odd picture.

But if you are one of those who use your mobile to send emails, watch TV and read the news-paper online every day, you’ll find that the battery can run down perilously quickly.

Considering how much we rely on our smartphones these days, it would be handy to have an equally portable way of charging them. Alice Smellie and Tony Dennis have put some to the test 

What might help is a charger that’s as mobile as your phone. So here, Alice Smellie and mobile phone expert Tony Dennis, editor of gomonews.com rate the new portable chargers — from wind-up to solar-powered...

WHAT A WIND UP

Wind-up phone charger, £24.99

Wind-up phone charger, £24.99, windup-products.com

USP: This is a sleek hand-held box, with a fold-out handle for winding. For each minute wound, it gives up to two minutes of battery. If your phone powers down in the wild, just it in to this and frantically twirl the handle.

TEST: It’s hard to charge the entire phone this way, but this is unbelievably useful to have in your car’s glove-box.

TONY SAYS: I’d very much recommend this if you’re out and about, but if you have a power-hungry phone it won’t keep it going for long. Only useful in the short-term.

TIME IN THE SUN

Groov-e, £19.99

Groov-e, £19.99, mymemory.co.uk

USP: This is either solar-powered or you can shine a lamp on it to automatically charge it. This functional-looking black charger is around the size of a smart phone and has enough battery for about two-and-a-half times the charge of an iPhone.

TEST: It’s idiot proof — it is obvious how to use it and I can see how much power it has left via a row of four lights. Not only did it charge my phone, but it also boosted the charge over the next four days.

TONY SAYS: A solar-powered phone is environmentally friendly, but most of these don’t come with the right phone lead, so you’ll need one.

LET THERE BE LIGHT

Audio powerbank, £20

Audio powerbank, £20, tesco.com

USP: This is both a torch and a charger. Slightly bigger than a lipstick, this will charge an iPhone one-and-a-half times before you need to recharge it — but it does suit many electrical devices including Samsung and Blackberry. Charge it up by plugging it into a laptop or USB port with the lead provided. Check you have your own lead to charge from charger to phone.

TEST: During last winter’s storms where I live in the West Country, I found myself in the pitch black with no phone battery. I intend to keep this fully charged by my bedside table for emergencies, and it’s great for your car, too.

TONY SAYS: One of the iPhone features which uses up the most battery is the flashlight. This torch will save masses of juice.

9/10

WALLET-SIZED WONDER

Hypercharger, £39.99

Hypercharger, £39.99, firebox.com

USP: A sexy, slender credit card-sized charger with enough charge for to get an iPhone to half power. It’s compatible with the iPhone 5.

TEST: By far the coolest looking charger, it is put through its paces in rural Dorset where one of my sons is playing hockey. I forget to charge my phone and by the time I reach the match it is almost dead. When I plug this in using the tiny attached lead, a slim white light flashes on the front. I delightedly watch my phone takes on just enough juice to get me through the afternoon.

TONY SAYS: Excellent, but only as a back-up.

8/10

LOTS OF TALK TIME

Innergie Pocket Cell, £69.99

Innergie Pocket Cell, £69.99, amazon.co.uk

USP: Gives up to 25 hours extra talk time on a mobile phone. Looks like a large cigarette lighter, but this gives a good two phones charge.

TEST: Plug this into your phone using a lead. It charges all USB powered devices — phones, mp3 players and tablets — adding four-and-a-half hours to an iPad. I use it on a day in London without a charged phone. It is dark and freezing cold, but I plug this in and within a couple of minutes I am connected.

TONY SAYS: Remember the days when you could carry around a spare battery and swap it into your phone? This is the closest thing. It is pricey, however

9/10

EVERY GIRL’S BEST FRIEND

Mirror Power, MIPOW, £49.99

Mirror Power, MIPOW, £49.99, cleverkit.com

USP: Touch up your make-up with a back-lit mirror while charging your phone. A slim iPhone-shaped mirror with enough charge to fill a phone up to two times.

TEST: I’m irritated by a female-targeted device. But I try this while waiting for my sons to finish school. It not only helps me do my make-up, it charges my phone in double-quick time.

TONY SAYS: The mirror element makes it bulkier than needed, but I suppose women will like it.

Smartphones have so much to offer now, it's not surprising the batteries drain so quickly
