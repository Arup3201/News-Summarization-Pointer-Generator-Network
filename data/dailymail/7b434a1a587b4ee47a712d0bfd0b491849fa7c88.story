A mother-of-three fell victim to a rare flesh-eating bug twice, leaving her fighting for her life after giving birth to two of her children three years apart.

In December, shortly after giving birth to her daughter Krystal, Maggie Ashe fell into a coma.

The bacterial infection Necrotising fasciitis (NF) was ravaging the 33-year-old's body, eating away at her body.

'The bug ate away at the fat and muscle in my stomach and hip,' she said. 'It looked like a shark bite.'

It is the second time the mother-of-three has developed the life-threatening disease, which can be triggered by minor ailments including chicken pox.

Ms Ashe’s first pregnancy passed without incident.

But in September 2010, while 34 weeks pregnant with her second baby, she developed a pea-sized lump on her thigh.

'I didn’t know what it was,' she said. 'But two days on it was dark and was the size of a melon.

'I was taken to hospital and was so delirious I asked doctors to chop my leg off.

Ms Ashe, a full-time mum, was given painkillers and antibiotics but slipped into unconsciousness.

She woke up 10 days later to find a huge area of infected flesh had been removed from her thigh.

Her baby, Lucas had been delivered by emergency caesarean – though she was initially so delirious that thought he had died.

It was another three days before Ms Ashe was allowed to see her baby - as doctors warned she was still infectious.

And even then she was unable to hold her son.

She said: 'I just said, "hello my baby boy" and stared at him.'

Lucas' traumatic arrival meant it took some time for Ms Ashe to bond with her son.

The ordeal left her needing a 12-inch skin graft to repair the crater left in her leg.

Having recovered, the 33-year-old thought everything had gone smoothly when she gave birth to her youngest child, Krystal, in December.

But just days after her birth, Ms Ashe's stomach began to blister and she was rushed to the Blackpool Victoria Hospital.

'It looked like something from a horror film,' she said. 'I don’t remember anything else – I fell into a coma.'

Following further surgery, Ms Ashe was discharged from hospital at the end of January and is now recovering at home in Blackpool, Lancashire.

She said the whole experience has left her fearing the extensive cosmetic surgery she needs to repair her badly damaged skin.

Doctors say they are baffled as to why she developed the disease twice.

Public Health England said: 'Necrotising
 fasciitis (NF) is a bacterial infection that affects the soft tissue 
and fascia (a sheet or band of fibrous connective tissue separating or 
binding together muscles and organs).

Ms Ashe first developed the infection after giving birth to her son Lucas in 2010. At 34 weeks pregnant she noticed a pea-sized lump on her thigh, which spread to the size of a melon within two days. She fell into a coma, waking 10 days later thinking her baby had died

'It can occur following a cut or some other opportunity for the bacteria to enter the body, such as surgery.

'The bacteria can also enter through weakened skin, like a blister. Sometimes there is no obvious entry point

'NF is a rare but serious condition.  

'One of the early signs is intense and severe pain which may seem out of proportion to any external signs of infection on the skin.

'There may be a small cut or scratch on the skin, for example, but the pain will be very bad.

'As it progresses, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting can develop, with the person eventually falling unconscious as the infection overcomes them.'

'The bug ate away at the fat and muscle in my stomach and hip,' MS Ashe said. 'It looked like a shark bite.'
