Lazing on the beach in the perfect Spanish sunshine and partying into the night in Ibiza is fine, but that was before tourists had the chance to play their own version of Total Wipeout at sea. 

Ocean Mania is inspired by the stunt TV franchise, for which the UK version is hosted by Top Gear's Richard Hammond, and just like the show daredevils get the chance to throw themselves about on a range of wacky obstacles.

Also in keeping with the show, failures on said challenges aren't be met with a thud but a splash and the amusement of others.  

The floating fun park, Ocean Mania, floats off Ocean Beach Ibiza in San Antonio

A total of 100 people can use the park at any one time and everyone has to wear a life jacket

The inflatable amusement opens on May 1 in Ibiza and was inspired by TV's Total Wipeout

The 7,000 square feet park includes a range of obstacles and challenges to play on

The supersized jungle gym is floating 165 feet out from Ibiza's Ocean Beach in San Antonio and a prerequisite for its use is the ability to swim out to it. 

There are no age restrictions for the attraction, which costs €25 for a day pass or €10 for an hour, but you must be over 1m or 3ft 3in to play on it. 

Once out there, slides, floating catapults, rope swings, trampolines and balance beams seemingly conspire to put users off balance and into the drink - all in the name of fun - await.

To get to Ocean Mania you must be able to swim the 50m (165 feet) into the Mediterranean to get there

Ocean Mania costs €25 for a day pass or €10 an hour - each hour block has different coloured life jackets 

A maximum of 100 people can take on the course, which covers 7,000 square feet of ocean, at any one time and everyone has to wear a lifejacket. 

Ocean Mania opens from May 1.
