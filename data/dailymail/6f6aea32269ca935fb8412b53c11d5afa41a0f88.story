Last chance: Silvio Berlusconi faces the end of his political career if his appeal against corruption charges is not upheld by Italy's highest court

Silvio Berlusconi's lawyers made their final arguments in front of Italy's highest court, seeking the reversal of a conviction that halt to the three-time former premier's 20-year political career.

The highly anticipated decision could catastrophically weaken the fragile coalition government of Enrico Letta, which is struggling to pass measures to help Italy out of recession.

A decision could come later today or tomorrow.

Berlusconi has urged supporters not to let the decision interfere with the government, but analysts warn that the situation is volatile.

Centre-right lawmakers have already slowed work in Parliament to protest the high court's decision to take the case in July instead of the autumn.

Without the support of those MPs the country's coalition will not have the votes to carry out its legislative agenda, a situation that could cause the country to face fresh elections.

Berlusconi and three others were convicted in October of tax fraud in the purchase of television rights for Berlusconi's Mediaset network.

Berlusconi was sentenced to four years in prison with a five-year ban on public office, which was confirmed on appeal.

If also confirmed by Italy's highest court, Berlusconi would lose his Senate seat and be banned from running in elections for the duration of any public office ban.

The state prosecutor on Tuesday 
recommended shortening the public office ban to three years - which 
Berlusconi defence lawyer Franco Coppi told reporters indicates a 
'blatant error' in the sentencing.

Police stand guard outside the Court of Cassation in Rome, as a gaggle of journalists gather to await the decision in Berlusconi's appeal. If found guilty, his supporters in parliament could seek to bring down the government

Berlusconi's defense team, long-time defender Niccolo Ghedini and Mr Coppi, an appellate expert, began what was expected to be several hours of arguments late this afternoon.

Earlier, defence lawyers for the other three defendants made their case.

At one point, chief justice Antonio Esposito grew impatient with the exhaustive arguments, telling a lawyer for one of the defendants: 'We have read everything.'
