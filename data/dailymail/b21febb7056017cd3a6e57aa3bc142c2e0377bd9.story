Maria Sharapova has incurred the wrath of Indian cricket fans after claiming she was unaware of legendary batsman Sachin Tendulkar.

Passionate Tendulkar fans have taken to Sharapova’s Facebook in their droves to make sure she becomes familiar with their idol.

The Russian’s every post has been littered with comments – some abusive – referring to Sachin, with many simply posting the former Indian batsman’s phenomenal run-scoring statistics.

Before long ‘Who is Maria Sharapova?’ was trending on Twitter as Sachin’s adoring fans hit back.

The little master was in the Royal Box on Saturday alongside David Beckham watching Sharapova’s third-round win over American Alison Riske.

When the French Open champion was asked if she was aware the cricket icon had watched her play, she said she had met Beckham on several occasions but didn’t know who Tendulkar was.

Sharapova was asked: 'Sachin Tendulkar was the other person who came in at the same time as David. Do you know who Sachin is?'

The five-time Grand Slam winner replied 'I don’t.' The Russia spoke glowingly of Beckham, however.

'I’ve actually met him a couple of times at events in L.A and in London. He is a great guy. Besides being an incredible football player, he has done so much in his career, having a family, maintaining so many things off court.'

Sharapova, Wimbledon champion aged just 17, was dumped out of this year’s tournament in the fourth round by German Angelique Kerber on Tuesday and sparking the fury of millions of Indian cricket fans won’t be helping one bit.
