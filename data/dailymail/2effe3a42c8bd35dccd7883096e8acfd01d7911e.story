A Barcelona director had sensationally claimed that Manchester United midfielder Angel di Maria was sold by Real Madrid last summer because he is 'too ugly'.

Di Maria, who has been struggling for form in recent United games, left the Bernabeu for £59.7m having guided Carlo Ancelotti’s side to the Champions League last season.

Carles Rexach says Di Maria was only allowed to leave as his image doesn’t fit the Galacticos brand that current club president Florentino Perez is trying to assemble at the La Liga giants.

Rexach says recent Real Madrid signings Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez prove his point and fit the image Perez is busy creating.

Barcelona's assistant director of football also brought up former Los Blancos boss Vicente del Bosque, who was sacked in 2003, despite winning two Champions League titles and domestic trophies.

Rexach told Spanish media outlet Regio7: ‘(Vicente) Del Bosque and Di Maria are too ugly for Real Madrid. They are different from Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez.

‘Florentino Perez looks at the world market and wants a team of Galacticos for everyone to admire.

‘(Cristiano) Ronaldo is the flagship of the club. Perez is selling an international brand.’
