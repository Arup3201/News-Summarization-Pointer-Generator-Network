Labour does not understand or appreciate the importance of family life, according to a former guru of Ed Miliband.

In a highly critical interview, Maurice Glasman also said it was no surprise that religious people would be sceptical about the party’s policies.

The academic claimed Labour had been ‘captured’ by an ‘aggressive public sector morality’ interested only in the individual and the collective.

The comments will give fuel to pro-family groups who have attacked Labour for opposing measures designed to help families, such as the married couple’s tax allowance. Lord Glasman’s comments came in an interview with the Catholic Herald newspaper.

He was asked why the faithful should listen to Labour, given that the party offended many traditionalists by forcing Catholic adoption agencies to arrange adoptions for gay couples. He said: ‘That’s a completely legitimate concern. I understand the scepticism from Catholics, from all faithful people. There’s a lack of understanding and a lack of appreciation for family.

‘The first thing is to acknowledge that Labour has been captured by a kind of aggressive public sector morality which is concerned with the individual and the collective but doesn’t understand relationships.’

Lord Glasman was given a peerage by Mr Miliband, has written speeches for the Labour leader and was seen as a close adviser. In 2009, he coined the term ‘Blue Labour’ arguing that the party should return to its working-class roots and embrace community values and volunteering.

At one point party insiders dubbed him Mr Miliband’s ‘de facto chief of staff’.

The 53-year-old has called for Labour to take a tougher line on immigration and focus more on helping the working classes. But he fell out of favour and he has since criticised Labour policy on a number of issues.

In the interview, Lord Glasman said he would want a Labour government to reward couples who stay together.

‘I’d like to see us redistribute resources to people who care – for each other, for children – so that couples can have a night out on a little date. I would have a weekend away for five years of marriage.

‘A week’s holiday for ten years of marriage. Maybe a cruise for 25 years. Just a present, an acknowledgement that this is not easy – to stay together, to care for others, to be faithful and to forgive and rebuild.

‘The whole direction of society is to reward freedom and so some generosity for people who make it work and do their duty – that’s what I mean when I say “rewarding virtue”.’

Lord Glasman is a senior lecturer in political theory at London Metropolitan University, and director of its faith and citizenship programme.

He has argued that Britain should renegotiate free movement rules that have allowed millions of EU migrants to come to this country.

He has also criticised Labour for being ‘hostile to the English working class’ and for drawing its leadership from too narrow a group of Oxbridge graduates.

Three years ago, the peer criticised Labour for ‘lying’ about the scale of immigration, and claimed that the previous Labour government had used mass immigration to control wages.

A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Maurice’s views do not represent the Labour Party.’

At one stage, Lord Glasman was acknowledged as Ed Miliband's 'de facto chief of staff'
