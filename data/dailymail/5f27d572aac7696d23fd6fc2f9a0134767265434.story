Celebrity: Stoned Fox may be a badly stuffed piece of taxidermy but that hasn't stopped him finding fame

This dazed-looking fox has a huge fan base in Russia, where the badly-stuffed creature became a surprise internet smash after he was spotted for sale on eBay.

The animal - dubbed Stoned Fox thanks to his bemused expression - proved such a hit his British creator has taken him all the way to St Petersburg for locals to get a closer look.

But it seems Russians are not universally fond of Stoned Fox, after local politicians in the city labelled the comical creature 'vile' and 'Russophobic'.

A statement from the local branch of the Communist Party described Stoned Fox's British creator, Adele Morse, as an 'unfriendly emissary from England' and demanded that her exhibition be shut down, according to a report in the Daily Telegraph.

Their suggestion that the artist 'had allowed herself to mock a great people and its history' comes after she was quoted as saying fans had told her they liked Stoned Fox because he 'looks a bit sad and drunk and that's how Russians feel'.

Ms Morse, who is based in Dalston, East London, has said she was misquoted.

The Welsh artist is in Russia to give a series of seminars on Stoned Fox and the thousands of internet memes he inspired.

Ms Morse was inundated with pictures showing the creature pasted into a host of unlikely scenarios; from inside the Oval Office with Barack Obama, to lounging on a park bench with Hollywood actor Keanu Reeves.

Ms Morse had experimented with stuffing the fox, which died of natural causes, and put the finished item on eBay.

Ms Morse is also due to meet journalists and fans to tell them about how Stoned Fox came to exist.

The eBay auction which sparked the craze started bidding at £12.

Ms Morse described the item as: 'a young Red Fox made to look as though it is a human.

'I usually practice traditional taxidermy but I decided to try something a little different.

'He is not perfect but he does have a lot of character.

'He can sit on a cabinet, chair, shelf, or plinth.'

The promise of 'character' and his versatility in positioning obviously sparked something in the minds of internet users.

A bidding war ensued after DJ Space Dimension Controller posted the link on his Facebook page.

He said: 'If someone can be bothered to keep 
bidding on this, and win it, i will personally turn up to your house and
play a live set and send you a signed copy of the album, with a picture
of me and this fox totally vibin' out.'

A music promoter from Manchester, Mike Boorman, beat other bidders to the taxidermied creature with a final bid of £330.

The
DJ, real name Jack Hamill, kept his word and did a set in the 
presence of the fox and Mr Boorman at Dance Tunnel in Dalston last month.

Shortly
after Mr Boorman claimed his prize, Ms Morse began to receive messages 
via eBay telling her that the stuffed animal was gaining quite a 
following in Russia.

By the end of 2012, Stoned Fox was declared 'the winner of the internet' by Russia's Metro Newspaper - quite a feat in the same year that Gangnam Style dominated the net.

Ms Morse told WalesOnline: 'I asked what it was about the fox that they liked and he told me that the fox looks a bit sad and drunk and that’s how Russians feel.

'His plastic eyes give him a glazed look and they identify with it, they think it symbolises the nation.'

The fox's stance apparently lends itself well to Photoshop-meddling, left, while Anna Veduta, press secretary to Russian activist Alexei Navalny, sported him on a T-shirt
