He was a child actor with a promising future, winning plaudits 12 years ago for his portrayal of an emotionally disturbed boy whose destructive behaviour tormented his family.

But Eric Byrne is today beginning a jail sentence for burglary and theft after his life took a similar path to that of the character he played on television.

Byrne appeared alongside stars including Ross Kemp, Lee Evans and Kathy Burke but sank into debt after becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol.

The 24-year-old, who starred in television dramas Holby City and Kid in the Corner as well as movie The Martins, was jailed for 15 months by a judge at Bristol Crown Court.

Judge Carol Hagen heard how Byrne had squandered a promising talent, eventually stealing from friends and burgling a house in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, to pay for his addictions.

One of his victims was a woman who had helped find him a flat to live in.

Byrne came to prominence in 1999 when he starred in Kid in the Corner, a Channel 4 drama which received award nominations.

He played Danny Letts, an emotionally disturbed boy who was given therapy and prescription drugs in an attempt to combat his destructive behaviour.

Byrne's on-screen sister was played by former EastEnders star Brooke Kinsella, who has become a prominent anti-knife campaigner since the murder of her half-brother Ben in 2008.

In 2000 Byrne played a villager in comedy Garage: A Rock Saga, starring former Cheers actor George Wendt, and appeared in made-for-television movie The Sleeper.

He also starred in the television version of A Christmas Carol, with ex-soap actor Ross Kemp.

Byrne played a dysfunctional child in The Martins, a comedy with a cast led by Kathy Burke and Lee Evans.

He next appeared alongside veteran British actor George Cole, the star of popular television series Minder, in TV railway film 'Station Jim'.

His final performance on television came in 2002 when he appeared as character Glen Hale in an episode of medical drama Holby City.

Actresses Tina Hobley and Luisa Bradshaw-White also appeared in the programme.

Trouble began when Byrne left acting and a once-promising football career, which involved training with West Ham United's youth academy, petered out.

In December last year, Byrne stole £300 from friend Ben Tarr after he stayed with him following a night out.

Troubled: The court heard that Byrne, pictured in Kid in the Corner broke up with his circus worker girlfriend and his life spiralled out of control

Robert Reed, prosecuting, told the court Mr Tarr had slept with his wallet under his pillow, but recalled being woken during the night by Byrne, who was heading out again.

'Only the following morning did the victim realise what had happened,' Mr Reed said. 'The wallet had been removed along with £300 in cash.'

Byrne later agreed to pay the money back by New Year's Eve.

Mr Reed told the court that Byrne called Mr Tarr that night and told him he had left four televisions in his van to replace the money.

But the televisions were linked to a burglary at the home of Natalie Days - who had previously helped Byrne find accommodation in a flat below hers.

Jewellery, watches and clothes were also stolen in the raid. Ms Days's insurance company paid out £20,000 but many items are still missing.

Byrne fled to Hertfordshire, where he was arrested on May 14 after handing himself in to police.

Nicholas Fridd, defending, told the court that Byrne's life had spiralled after he broke up with his girlfriend, a circus worker.

He said: 'That's when things went wrong for Byrne with drink and drugs.

'He is ashamed of what he did as he breached trust and friendship to steal.'

The judge told Byrne his actions had been 'particularly mean' as he had breached the trust of a woman who had helped him.

'It was a burglary that not only involved valuable property but with a sentimental value too,' she said

The judge added: 'I hope when you are released from this you can make a fresh start - free from drugs and alcohol.'
