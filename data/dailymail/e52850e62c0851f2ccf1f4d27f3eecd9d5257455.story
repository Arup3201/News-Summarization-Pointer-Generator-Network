Men, if you thought a handshake was a simple case of grip, shake and release, you are very mistaken.

The humble handshake is in fact a weapon of seduction in disguise, with hanging on to her hand for as long as possible being the key element to finding love... apparently.

According to website Attraction Methods, which specialises in showing men how to win the women of their dreams, a clingy handshake is just one of many ways to win a woman over.

Holding on for as long as possible is the key to making it special, he enthuses as the model grins manically

The latest video tutorial explains that as well as continuing to hold onto a woman’s hand while you speak to her, how you let go is important.

‘Magic’, the instructor who runs Attraction Methods, suggests rather than just releasing the hand, a man should gently stroke along the palm as he slides his hand away.

We're not sure how many women out there will agree.

Attraction Methods claims to teach men how to ‘meet, attract, and date women using proven, easy-to-learn tactics.’ 

Women, according to another one of the website's short videos, simply need to be led ‘inch by inch’ to the place where ‘they don’t want to be but men want them to be.’

As well as cringe-making pulling tutorials the website sells full DVD kits whose contents should make single women shudder.

The $197 (£120) Same Night Lay DVD Set teaches ‘strategies to approach women and seduce them to go home with you the same night’, and the Social Circle Dating DVD Set, also $197, ‘will teach you techniques to build an impeccable social circle, then sleep with women within this circle.’

Attraction Methods is a global operation offering a dating coach service and a full on ‘pick up artist boot camp' in London.

‘Parts of London such as Kensington and Chelsea have 2 single females for every male but the men better have deep pockets or superb attraction skills because the women here are wealthy and attractive,’ the dating coach page informs men.

‘The rules of dating have also changed drastically with women getting higher education and better jobs.

‘Making women fall in love in London is not as easy as it used to be.

‘Sure there are lot of Eastern European women who are still feminine but there is a huge number of men competing for a small number of European women,’ it continues.
