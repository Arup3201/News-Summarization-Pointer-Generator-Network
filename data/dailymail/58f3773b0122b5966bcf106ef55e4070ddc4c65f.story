Bruce Jenner has been spotted getting into a tiny Ford Fiesta just two days after he crashed his Cadillac Escalade in a four-car pileup that left a 69-year-old woman dead. 

The former Olympian took the $14,000 compact car out for a spin today after a weekend under the public glare for his driving. He was pictured this morning going on his usual Starbucks coffee run.

Detectives in Malibu have opened a vehicular homicide investigation in the crash Saturday afternoon on the Pacific Coast Highway, CNN reports. If any of the drivers in the crash if found criminally negligent, felony charges could be filed - which carry a sentence of up to six years in prison.

On Monday, detectives said they are planning to ask Jenner to turn over his cell phone records to show whether he was texting while driving at the time of the crash - an activity that could net a vehicular manslaughter charge under California law, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians' reality star has vehemently denied he was texting and driving and said he would gladly offer up his cell phone records to move it. 

Jenner allegedly smashed into the back of a Lexus driven by Kim Howe - forcing it into the oncoming lane, where she was hit head-on by a Hummer H3 and killed.  

At the time he was driving a $76,000 Escalade ESV, which was hauling a dune buggy. 

It was revealed on Monday the Mrs Howe, a widow who owned a house in the same gated Calabasas community where Kim Kardashian lives, did not have a valid driver's license. And has not had one since 2007, the Times reports.  

Jenner, who is in the midst of transitioning from a man to a woman, told police that he was taking a 'very low dosage of hormones that his doctor had prescribed,' a family source told Radar Online.

The very next day, he was spotted out in his Porsche 911 GT3 RS - a 500hp supercar that costs about $185,000. 

Pictures from the outing published by the New York Post show Jenner speeding. He was driving at least 56mph in a 50mph zone, according to a digital speed limit sign on the road. 

It is unknown why Jenner opted to dramatically downgrade his set of wheels.

One possibility is that he was hoping to go incognito in a low-profile car. The crash comes at a time when Jenner was already at the height of his post-Olympic fame as he prepares to publicly reveal that he is transgender and is becoming a woman. 

He reportedly claimed after the crash that it was the result of him being followed by aggressive paparazzi photographers. 

Investigators said that the paparazzi were not creating a danger and likely not a factor in the crash. 

It could be, too, that Jenner suspected that a less flashy care would attract less attention following two days in the spotlight for his habits on the road. 

On Sunday, Jenner released a statement that said: 'My heartfelt and deepest sympathies go out to the family and loved ones, and to all of those who were involved or injured in this terrible accident. 

'It is a devastating tragedy, and I cannot pretend to imagine what this family is going through at this time. I am praying for them. I will continue to cooperate in every way possible.'
