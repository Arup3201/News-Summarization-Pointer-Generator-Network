Isis militants threatened to give anyone caught watching last Sunday's Real Madrid versus Barcelona football match 80 lashes.

The  group has imposed a strict ban against any entertainment including music and football which it considers a 'product of the decadent West.'

Clerics issued the edict across all the Isis-held territories in Syria and Northern Iraq including the city of Mosul which has been governed as per the strict dictates of Sharia since it was taken under Isis control in June.

It is not yet known if anyone was caught watching the match where Barcelona secured a 2.1 win over Real Madrid with Luis Suarez's second-half winner.

A Kudistan Democratic Party source told The Sun: 'IS prohibits watching and playing any sport, particularly football as it seen as a product of the decadent West.'

In January, Isis militants  executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week.

The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State.

The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently reports.

It noted that 'the bodies of the dead boys were left in the open', as ISIS had warned anyone from touching their bodies.

Last month the militant group imposed a curfew in the city of Tel Abiad North of Raqqa province, according to Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently - a small activist collective which secretly documents the shocking violence and oppression ISIS has brought to their home city.

The curfew, from eleven at night until six in the morning, prevented civilians from exiting their houses under any circumstances.
