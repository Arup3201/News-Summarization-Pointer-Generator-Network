These may look like normal takeaway fish and crispy chips wrapped up in brown paper, but put them in your mouth and you're likely to get a rather sweet surprise.

The upside-down meal created by student Belinda Lo is actually made entirely of cake and biscuits.

Lo wanted to recreate the classic meal for guests to enjoy at her 
birthday celebrations, and decided to turn the savoury dish into a sweet 
treat.

Fish and chips... made entirely out of cake and biscuits by student Belinda Lo

She split cookie dough into two fish-shaped sections before 
baking them in the oven for half an hour, and then coating in white 
chocolate.

She then rolled the biscuits in crumbled cornflakes and toasted shredded coconut to give the impression of breadcrumbs.

Belinda made chips by sprinkling sugar and salt over long strips of the cookie mix and then baking for 20 minutes.

She assembled the 'ingredients' over a custard sponge muffin and wrapped the whole thing in brown paper to look authentic.

Belinda served her masterpiece in brown paper with a lemon wedge and sachets of ketchup to make it look more authentic

Winter Club Sandwich, Andaz Hotel

Food designer Linda Monique, a 
finalist in Australia's first MasterChef series, created the WInter Club Sandwich for the Andaz Hotel in London.

Rather than the savoury fillings one might expect, the sandwich was made entirely of sweet ingredients.

The
bread is sponge cake, while other ingredients in the sandwich 
include spiced poached pears, slow roasted Braeburn apples, caramel 
curd, Earl Grey tea mayonnaise and a lemon 'fried egg'.

Trompe
l'oeil treat: The club sandwich is a combination of sponge cake and 
sweet fruit fillings created by food designer Linda Monique for Andaz 
hotel

The very realistic fries are 
actually long, thin doughnuts (no healthier than the real thing, then!), 
the ketchup is fruit jam, the 'mayonnaise' is cream flavoured with the 
delicate bergamot and citrus flavours of Earl Grey tea.

Monique
collaborated with the Andaz Liverpool Street's pastry chef, Joseph 
Wagenaar, to develop the Winter Club Sandwich in March this year using seasonal flavours 
to conjure up what they called 'comforting flavours reminiscent of 
winter'.

Clever: The fries are actually long thin doughnuts sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon and served with Earl Grey cream and fruit jam

Pret-a-Portea, Berkeley Hotel

This
sweet tea will never grow old - mainly because the innovative and 
clearly fashion forward pastry chefs are constantly updating the 
delicacies - from handbags and shoes to millinery-inspired creations - 
to roll with the changing season.

Couture cakes: The Berkeley's Pret-a-Portea has become an institution for fashionistas who love to do tea

Previous season's offerings 
have included Mulberry bag biscuits and a profiterole version of 
Princess Beatrice's Philip Treacy wedding hat - and all served on fine-bone china by Paul Smith for Thomas Goode.
