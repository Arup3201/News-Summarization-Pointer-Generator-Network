If the infamous It’s a Royal Knockout show is becoming a faded memory, here’s why... Prince Edward turns 50 today.

To mark the occasion Buckingham Palace have issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn.

Taken in in the panelled dining room in their Berkshire home, Bagshot Park, by photographer Millie Pilkington, who also took the private photographs at the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding, it is a particularly relaxed family portrait.

To mark Prince Edward's 50th birthday, Buckingham Palace have issued a charming new portrait of the Earl of Wessex, the title he was granted on his marriage, his wife, Sophie, the Countess of Wessex and their two children The Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and James, Viscount Severn

Edward,
 dressed in a lilac shirt unbuttoned at the neck to display a hint of 
hairy chest, and bottle green trousers sits holding his giggling son, 
six, on the arm of his chair.

His
 daughter, ten, wearing a grey pinafore and white jumper clutches his 
arm affectionately, while his wife of almost 15 years, Sophie, smiles 
broadly as she crouches behind.

Aside
 from the release of the official portrait, the prince has determinedly 
refused to make a big deal of out his landmark birthday, granting a 
single interview to a children’s news programme.

He
 will, however, conduct two public engagements with his wife in support 
of the Wessex Youth Trust, the charity the couple set up shortly before 
their marriage in 1999.

The couple will then accompany the Queen and other senior royals to the Commonwealth Observance Service at Westminster Abbey.

In
 recent years Edward, often cited as the Queen’s favoured son, has 
become something of the quiet man of the British monarchy, conducting 
258 engagements last year with little fanfare.

He
 is also considered the successor to his father’s Duke of Edinburgh 
Awards scheme and been handed the plum role of International Trustee and
 Chairman of the International Council.

This has resulted in him becoming one of the most well-travelled members of the royal family last year.

In
 2013 he conducted 87 engagement overseas, bettered only by his wife - 
who carried out 95 - and Prince Charles, who also clocked up 95 jobs but
 undertook two lengthy foreign tours on behalf of the British 
government. The couple were in Barbados and Jamaica only last week.

It is, perhaps, seen as a reward for years of quiet service after being forced to give up his chosen career.

After leaving university, Edward famously joined the Royal Marines but dropped out of training within months.

He
 decided to pursue a career in entertainment, starting off as a 
production assistant for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Really Useful Theatre 
Company but also produced the ill-fate It’s A Royal Knockout in 1987.

In
 1993 he formed his own company, Ardent Productions, but was accused of 
profiting out of his position by making a series of royal documentaries

The
 company made a series of losses until, in 2001, one of his own film 
crews invaded his nephew, Prince William’s privacy, while he was 
studying in Scotland by secretly filming him, causing a public – and 
private – furore.

The 
following year it was announced that he and his wife, whose own PR 
business had been similarly dogged by controversy, would give up their 
business interests to concentrate on their royal duties.

Friends,
 however, say Edward, who is now eighth-in-line to the throne, is happy 
and relaxed in his new role as a dutiful son and now father.

Bagshot Park, Surrey, the home of the Earl and Countess of Wessex

Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex, turns 50 tomorrow and celebrations are being held today at his home

Prince Edward and wife Sophie, Countess of Wessex, were on tour in Barbados last week

He and his wife tried for several years to start a family and suffered the devastating loss of an ectopic pregnancy.

One
 friend said: ‘It really is lovely to see Edward and Sophie sitting down
 on the floor playing with their children. They are such hand-on parents
 and totally unstuffy. Louise and James were much longed-for children 
and are the centre of their world.’

Earlier
 this year it was revealed that Louise, the Queen’s youngest 
grand-daughter, had undergone surgery to correct a severe squint she had
 since birth.

This latest portrait shows the surgery appears to have been successful.
