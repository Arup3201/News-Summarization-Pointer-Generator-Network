Bankers are set to be awarded £5billion in bonuses, including £2.2billion for staff at scandal-hit HSBC.

The vast sum is expected to be paid out to bankers at HSBC despite it being embroiled in a tax dodging row.

And Royal Bank of Scotland, bailed out by the taxpayer after the financial crash, is likely to hand its staff £500million in bonuses.

Bankers are set to be awarded £5billion in bonuses, including nearly £900million for staff at bailed out Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds

Lloyds, which was also bailed out by the Government to the tune of nearly £20billion, is expected to pay its bankers £375million in bonuses, the Mirror reported.

Meanwhile Barclays is expected to pay its staff around £2billion, taking the estimated total in bonuses at the Big Four banks to almost £5billion, despite the banking industry being mired in scandal.

It is claimed that HSBC's Swiss arm helped wealthy customers evade tax, while its Geneva offices were raided earlier this week as part of an 'aggravated money laundering' investigation.

John O'Connell, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'The cost of the bank bailouts is still hitting the country's finances hard and huge bonuses will just rub salt in the wound.

'The government has got to get the cost of funding these banks off the backs of taxpayers and into the private sector where they belong.' 

RBS was saved from collapse by taxpayers after a £45billion bail-out kept them afloat in 2008. The Government still owns the majority - 79 per cent - of the bank.

HSBC is expected to pay out £2.2billion in bonuses to its staff despite claims the bank helped wealthy customers dodge tax

The vast bonuses, set to be less than the £576million paid out in 2013, could be announced next week when the bank reveals its annual results.

Meanwhile Lloyds' bonuses are also expected to be down from last year, falling from £395million. 

The claims that HSBC's Swiss arm helped thousands of customers dodge tax comes seven years after its former IT worker Herve Falciani fled Geneva with details of thousands of clients suspected of avoiding tax in their home countries, including 6,000 Britons. 

Files including the names of 30,000 account holders including celebrities, were leaked. They claimed huge sums were channelled through HSBC as customers dodged taxes or laundered proceeds of crime.

Last week, a leaked memo revealed that HSBC was willing to help a ‘blood diamond’ trader even though he was being investigated for tax evasion. The term refers to uncut gems smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund brutal civil wars.

HSBC said its private banking operation has been overhauled and accounts of suspect clients closed.

A spokesman said: ‘We have co-operated continuously with the Swiss authorities since first becoming aware of the data theft in 2008.’

HSBC were willing to help a 'blood diamond' smuggler even though they knew that he was being investigated over tax evasion, according to a leaked memo. 

The bank aided Emmanuel Shallop before he was convicted for his part in an illegal trade that fuelled war in Africa.

According to one memo seen by the Guardian, one banker said: 'The client is currently being very careful because he is under pressure from the Belgian tax authorities who are investigating his activities in the field of diamond tax evasion.' 

HSBC bankers also helped him open a bank account in Dubai.

Blood diamonds were rough, uncut gemstones, smuggled out of Africa and sold to fund civil wars.

The main countries involved were Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, The Democratic Republic of Congo and the Ivory Coast.

Emmanuel Shallop used his company Shallop Diamonds to trade conflict diamonds for Revolutionary United Front (RUF) leaders in Sierra Leone.
