An internationally renowned preacher was among nine people killed last night when a private jet crashed into a ship-yard crane and exploded  as it came in to land on the island of Grand Bahama.

Dr Myles Munroe, 56, and wife Ruth were travelling to a religious convention that he had organised in Freeport when their Lear 36 Executive Jet ploughed into the steel structure and burst into a ball of flame at around 5pm yesterday.

They had taken off from Bahamian capital Nassau 45 minutes earlier.  

‘The Department of Civil Aviation has been advised unofficially that the aircraft was destroyed and that there were no survivors,’ the country's Ministry of Transport and Aviation.

Two of the dead have been named as Dr Myles Munroe, the leader of Bahamas Faith Ministries, and his wife Ruth

Known for his work as a 'lecturer, teacher, life coach, government consultant, and leadership mentor', Dr Munroe - who was awarded the OBE in 1998 for his 'spiritual and social contributions to the national development of the Bahamas' - was the leader of Bahamas Faith Ministries (BFM).

The passengers were on their way to the Global Leadership Forum hosted by the BFM, an organization that Munroe, 60, founded.

The identities of the other people on board have not yet been confirmed.

The plane reportedly struck a crane at the Grand Bahama Ship Yard, exploding on impact and crashing into the ground near a junkyard area.

There had been heavy rain across the region which may have caused the plane to hit the crane.

The plane departed Lynden Pindling International Airport (LPIA) at 4.07pm and crashed while making an approach for landing at Grand Bahama International Airport at 5.10pm, the Department of Civil Aviation said. 

The ministry said authorities were on scene and a full investigation would begin at daylight on Monday. Grand Bahama is about 70 miles east of Florida.

The nine passengers killed in Sunday's crash were on their way to a Global Leadership Forum hosted by the Dr. Munroe's Bahamas Faith Ministries organization. Above a photo of a different Munroe event in October
