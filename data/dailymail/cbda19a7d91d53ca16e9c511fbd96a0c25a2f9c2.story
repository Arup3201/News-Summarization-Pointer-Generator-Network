Tragic: Freya James, 8, was taken ill after the incident at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, last Thursday and died in hospital

An eight-year-old girl has died after apparently falling over in the playground at school.

Freya James was taken ill at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, Middlesex, last Thursday and later died in a London hospital. Her death is being treated as non-suspicious.

Her parents released an emotional statement, saying Freya was 'loved by everybody who had contact with her' and their 'hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly' following her death.

They said: 'Freya was an Angel and was loved by everybody who had contact with her.

'She was a bundle of energy from the time she woke up to the time she went to bed. She was so strong and determined in everything she did and always tried to help those that struggled.

'Our princess has gone but we know her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been absolutely shattered. Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly and we are left with scars that will never heal.'

The school is linked with five others in
the area, and a governor at a neighbouring school said health and 
safety procedures were looked into at all those linked to Trafalgar 
following the death.

The governor said: ‘As far as we can tell at the moment it looks like everything has been done by the book. There is nothing to suggest that anyone was a fault.’

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that police are investigating the death of a child following an incident at a school in Twickenham at about 1.15pm on Thursday, February 14.

‘Paramedics attended. Next of kin are aware and we await formal identification to take place.’

A London Ambulance Service spokesman said: ‘We were called at 1.25pm on February 14, to reports of a patient taken unwell at Trafalgar Junior School, Twickenham.

‘We sent one ambulance and a single responder in a car to the scene. Our staff treated one patient, a girl believed to be eight years old, who was taken as a priority to West Middlesex Hospital.’

'Our princess has gone but we know her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been absolutely shattered. Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly and we are left with scars that will never heal'

Family of Freya James, aged eight

Paramedics were at the school in just over four minutes after receiving a call. Metropolitan Police officers in Twickenham and the Health and Safety Executive are now investigating.

A post-mortem examination was due to take place today at Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in Lambeth, central London, but was postponed until tomorrow.

Nick Whitfield, director of education and children's services at Richmond Council, said: ‘Our sincere thoughts are with the parents and family of the pupil at this very sad time.

‘The council is offering full support to them, her teachers and fellow pupils. We are also working with the school and the Health and Safety Executive to carry out a full investigation looking at how this tragic accident happened.’
