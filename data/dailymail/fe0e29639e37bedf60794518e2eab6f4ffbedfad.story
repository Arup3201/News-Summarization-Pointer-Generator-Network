A white Milwaukee police officer who was fired after he fatally shot a mentally ill black man in a downtown park in April won't face criminal charges, the county's top prosecutor said Monday.

Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm said in an emailed press release that Christopher Manney won't be charged because he shot Dontre Hamilton in self-defense.

Manney is at least the third white police officer to avoid charges in the past month after a confrontation that led to a black man's death.

'This was a tragic incident for the Hamilton family and for the community,' Chisholm said in a statement. 'But, based on all the evidence and analysis presented in this report, I come to the conclusion that Officer Manney's use of force in this incident was justified self-defense and that defense cannot be reasonably overcome to establish a basis to charge Officer Manney with a crime.' 

After waiting eight months for the decision, Hamilton's family reacted with disappointment and anger. At a chaotic news conference on the steps of the federal courthouse, family attorneys said they had asked the U.S. attorney in Milwaukee to seek a federal investigation.

They also urged that protests be peaceful 'so as not to dishonor Dontre's name and the Hamilton family name.'

But Hamilton's brother Nate spoke bitterly, saying the family had "cried too long" and "we don't have to be the voice of reason."

'We need to take our communities back. We need to protect each other. We need to stop the violence in our communities so we can get rid of these pigs that kill us,' he said to shouts and applause. 'Because that's what they are. They feed, they feed off of us. And we can't let them do that no more.'

His remarks came just two days after two New York City police officers were ambushed in their patrol car.

Police said that attack was carried out by a man who posted online about putting 'wings on pigs.'

Jon Safran, a Hamilton family attorney, later said that Nate Hamilton doesn't condone 'any type of violence.'

'Obviously the family is dealing with great anxiety and frustration right now,' he said. 'They believe they were not provided the justice they hoped they were going to get.'

Manney's attorney did not return a message seeking comment.

Chisholm announced that there would be no charges against former police office Christopher Manney in the fatal shooting of Dontre Hamilton

Chisholm consulted with experts on the use of force by police officers, who concluded Manney's conduct was justified.

Emanuel Kapelsohn of the Peregrine Corp. said all the shots were discharged in 3 or 4 seconds and there was no evidence that Manney continued firing after Hamilton hit the ground.

Manney suffered minor injuries, including a bite to his right thumb, a neck strain and neck contusion, the report said.

He was treated for post-concussion syndromes, a mild traumatic brain injury and had physical therapy for bicep and rotator cuff injuries, the report said.

Police Chief Edward Flynn fired Manney in October. He said at the time that Manney correctly identified Hamilton as mentally ill, but ignored department policy and treated him as a criminal by frisking him.

Manney shot 31-year-old Hamilton on April 30 after responding to a call for a welfare check on a man sleeping in the park. Manney said Hamilton resisted when he tried to frisk him.

The two exchanged punches before Hamilton got a hold of Manney's baton and hit him on the neck with it, the former officer has said. Manney then opened fire, hitting Hamilton 14 time - including in the back. 

Hamilton's family said he suffered from schizophrenia and had recently stopped taking his medication.

The chief said Manney correctly identified Hamilton as mentally ill but ignored his training and department policy, and treated him as a criminal.

'You don't go hands-on and start frisking somebody only because they appear to be mentally ill,' Flynn said when he announced Manney had been dismissed.

Hamilton's death preceded those of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York City, but the case hasn't attracted as much attention despite frequent, mostly peaceful protests. Hamilton's family has used the protests to try to raise awareness about mental illness.

Others said his death underlined race concerns, chanting "people of color are people, too," and carrying signs that read "black lives matter."

The Milwaukee Police Association condemned Manney's firing as a political move, and members voted no confidence in Flynn soon after the firing.

Manney has appealed his firing and applied for disability, saying the shootings in Milwaukee and Ferguson have cost him sleep and made it difficult for him to think clearly. He also has said he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.

The Wisconsin National Guard started calling up members over the weekend and are in position to respond rapidly if needed, said Maj. Paul Rickert. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke Jr. requested the Guard's assistance after 74 protesters were arrested for blocking rush hour traffic Friday night on Interstate 43.

On Monday, the state Department of Military Affairs activated its emergency operations center to monitor the situation in Milwaukee and coordinate activities between any affected state agencies.

Raymond Dall'Osto, a former Milwaukee public defender and former legal director of the ACLU's Wisconsin chapter, said before Chisholm's announcement that it was a difficult case.

He said some people are employed in professions that run a greater risk of personal injury or death, 'but that doesn't give you a greater right to take someone else's life.'

Milwaukee police announced in December they would accelerate training that equips officers for dealing with crises, including encounters with the mentally ill.

Only about 20 per cent of the force's roughly 1,800 officers have had the training 

Sputnik news is already worrying the situation could spark public outcry similar to the Ferguson case with 74 arrested Friday in a mass protest that caused a three-mile traffic jam.

The Wisconsin’s Attorney General, JB Van Hollen, told Fox 6 Now he had kept himself at a 'deliberate distance' from the case.

In the past, he fought against legislation that required an outside agency investigate officer involved deaths. 

'We didn't have an example of how the prior system was broken. The way these were being investigated, people may not have liked the outcomes, but I didn't see any cases where changing the outcomes of the investigations would have changed the outcomes,' he said.
