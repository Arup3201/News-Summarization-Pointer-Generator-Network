A driver travelling the wrong way on a road crashed head-on into a car carrying five students going away for spring break, killing herself, three of the students and leaving two other students injured.

The three Bowling Green State University sorority sisters heading out of town were killed in the accident this morning at 2:30am on Interstate 75 south of Toledo, Ohio, just miles from the campus.

It happened at a crest in the highway and the northbound student who was driving, Christina Goyett, had no warning, police said. The woman, Winifred Lein, 69, of Perrysburg, Ohio, was travelling alone.

All dead: Christina Goyett, Sarah Hammond and Rebekah Blakkolb (left-to-right) seen in their school photos

Tragedy: Three sisters were killed in this car after it crashed head-on into another car driving the wrong way

The students killed were Rebekah 
Blakkolb, 20, a junior from Aurora, Ohio; Miss Goyett, 19, a sophomore 
from Bay City, Michigan; and Sarah Hammond, 21, a junior from Yellow 
Springs, Ohio.

'I don't think the college girls ever saw it coming. Nothing they could have done to avoid the crash'

Wood County Sheriff Mark Wasylyshyn

The injured were freshman Angelica
 Mormile, 19, from Garfield Heights, Ohio; and Kayla Somoles, 19, a 
sophomore from Cleveland, Ohio. There were 16 of them going to a 
Dominican Republic resort.

‘I
 don't think the college girls ever saw it coming,’ Wood County Sheriff 
Mark Wasylyshyn said. ‘Nothing they could have done to avoid the crash.’

‘The
 college girls apparently did nothing wrong. They were just driving 
northbound and a woman driving in the opposite direction in the wrong 
way on the roadway hit them head-on.’

Wreckage: The students were driving a 2004 Pontiac Grand Prix, and three of them were killed by the crash

Destroyed: Ms Lein, 69, was in a 1999 Plymouth Breeze which burst into flames following the crash

The university said the students were 
members of Alpha Xi Delta sorority. The school's president Mary Ellen 
Mazey said on Facebook that the two students were hospitalised with 
serious injuries.

The students were driving a 2004 
Pontiac Grand Prix while Ms Lein was in a 1999 Plymouth Breeze which 
burst into flames following the crash, police told student newspaper BG News.

Christina was driving the vehicle and
 Angelica was in the front passenger seat. Kayla was in the right rear 
seat, Rebekah was in the rear middle and Sarah was in the rear left.

Rebekah
 was taken to hospital and later died there, but Christina and Sarah 
died at the scene - as well as Ms Lein. Christina and Angelica were 
wearing seatbelts, but Rebekah and Kayla were not.

Dead: Two of the students killed in the accident on Interstate 75 south 
of Toledo, Ohio, were Rebekah Blakkolb, left, 20, a junior from Aurora, 
Ohio; and Sarah Hammond, right, 21, a junior from Yellow Springs, Ohio

Tragic: Christina Goyett, left and right, 19, a sophomore from Bay City, Michigan, was also killed on Friday

In hospital: Two other students were injured - Angelica Mormile, 19, left, and Kayla Somoles, 19, right

Ms Lein was wearing a seatbelt but it's unknown if Sarah had one on, reported the BG News.

Four drivers called 911 
after 2:10am to report a car going south in the northbound lanes of the 
road - and another car of students in convoy with Christina's vehicle
 was almost hit too.

Court records show Ms Lein had been previously cited locally for a 
lane change violation. She pleaded guilty in September 2002 to the 
traffic violation and was told to pay $61 court costs.

Christina's family friend Dee Bishop 
said she had left with friends planning to be at Detroit airport by 2am 
on Friday in preparation for a 5:30am flight.

More than 250 people went to St Thomas More University Parish at the university for a lunchtime mass

Grief: The mass was held by Father Mike Dandurand in remembrance of the students who have died

Mourning: Students gather outside the Alpha Xi Delta sorority house on Friday after three members died

The university's spring break begins tomorrow.

Ms Bishop called Goyett a wonderful, 
happy positive person who loved animals and children, who was was 
studying English but thought she might become a special education 
teacher.

FOUR KILLED

TWO INJURED

More
 than 250 people gathered at St Thomas More University Parish at the 
university for a lunchtime mass held by Father Mike Dandurand in 
remembrance of the students who have died.

It
 was the second school tragedy in five days in Ohio. On Monday, three 
students were fatally shot and two others wounded at Chardon High 
School. T.J. Lane, 17, was charged.

Ten
 years ago six Bowling Green students, all aged 19, were killed 
returning home from a spring break trip to Panama City, Florida, in 
March 2002, when their minivan slid into oncoming traffic and was 
struck.

Authorities said 
severe winds and heavy rain may have contributed to that crash in 2002, 
which happened on Interstate 71 near Verona, Kentucky, about 25 miles 
south of Cincinnati, Ohio.

Sadness: People embrace near the Alpha Xi Delta sorority on Friday on the campus of Bowling Green State University in Bowling Green, Ohio, as news filtered through of the students' deaths in the early morning

Wreckage: The accident occurred at a crest in the highway and the student who was driving had no warning

Bowling Green State University, which has a $300million
 operating budget and costs up to $25,604 a year to attend, was founded
