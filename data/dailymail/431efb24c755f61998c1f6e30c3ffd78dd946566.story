Usher's 11-year-old stepson 'has been declared brain dead by doctors' following a jet ski accident yesterday.

TMZ reports that Kyle Glover, the son of Usher's ex-wife Tameka 'has not experienced any brain activity' since he was admitted to hospital.

accident

Critical: The child was taken to the Children's Healthcare unit at Egelston Hospital in Atlanta

Usher is reported to have arrived at the hospital last night to join his former wife at her son's bedside.

Tameka has spoken to Radaronline since the accident, telling the website that her son is not doing well.

'He’s bad,' she said.

The mother-of-five also posted a message on her Facebook page thanking friends and fans for their support.

'Kyle, You are strong.. You'll be saved I know it. I love you my baby. I need all #Prayers for my son! thanks you everybody!' she wrote.

Scene of tragedy: Kyle was enjoying himself at Lake Lanier in Georgia, his father Ryan lives in Atlanta

The schoolboy was struck in the head by a 38-year-old man riding a jet ski as he rode an inner tube towed by a speedboat on Lake Lanier in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was unresponsive when he was rescued from the water.

A 15-year-old female companion is also reported to have been struck.

The accident is now being investigated, with the Department of Natural Resource in Atlanta launching an inquiry.

They plan to recreate the incident to help determine what happened.

The
Wildlife Resources Division department's Critical Incident Response 
Team will use special computer programs to help them determine how fast 
the boats were going at the time of the accident.

Robin
Hill, a representative for the organisation confirmed that rangers have
been in touch with the driver of the jet ski and remain in contact with
him.

They will hand their recommendation over to the district attorney who can then decide whether or not to file charges, once the department has completed their investigation. 

Usher, 33, split from Tameka back in 2009 with their divorce finalised later that year.

The superstar singer is said to have chartered a plane for Tameka, who was out of town, to be at her son's bedside at the Children's Healthcare at Egelston Hospital yesterday.

Tameka, who has two children by the singer, Usher Raymond VI, four and three-year-old Naviyd Ely Raymond, was reported by TMZ sources to be 'extremely thankful' for the gesture and 'rushed immediately to be with her son.'

Kyle is one of two sons Tameka had by Atlanta clothier Ryan Glover. She gave birth to her first son as a teenager.
