Fernando Torres is aiming high as he looks to rebuild his reputation as a world class striker at AC Milan after securing a two-year loan deal from Chelsea.

Torres appears on the front page of Italy's La Gazzetta dello Sport saying he wants his work in the No 9 shirt at Milan to rank alongside some of the club's legends. 'My shirt to rank alongside [Marco] van Basten, [George] Weah and [Filippo] Inzaghi,' the headline reads.

The Spaniard appears alongside fellow striker Stephan El Shaarawy who, much like Torres, is determined to show his worth at the club after a lean 2013-14 campaign. 'It wasn't Balotelli's fault I lost my form,' the Italy international said of the now Liverpool striker who was ahead of him in the pecking order before his departure.

Another Spanish forward, Alvaro Morata, is making vows to his new club after joining Juventus from Real Madrid in a £15.8million deal. 'I'm ready and I won't disappoint, this is a personal battle,' he said in Corriere dello Sport.

Also the paper says Antonio Conte is likely to favour youth in his first match in charge of Italy with El Shaarawy and Simone Zaza set to feature against Holland and Torres says he'll be 'reborn' at Milan.

Despite Roma looking a better prospect than last season Juve are favourites to defend the Scudetto, says Tuttosport. 'Roma have improved strongly, but the non-sale of [Arturo] Vidal and [Paul] Pogba can make the difference.'

Spain's sports media are of course reporting the latest blow to Carlo Ancelotti who while keeping Sami Khedira on his books in the transfer window has lost the midfielder for a number of weeks - Marca says six while AS says he could be out for eight weeks.  

In AS, Sergio Ramos has shown Real Madrid team-mates 'who is boss' with the leadership figure telling star Cristiano Ronaldo that 'we must obey the laws of Madrid' after the striker's recent comments about his side's transfer activity. 

Real president Florentino Perez says he's hurt by Ronaldo's criticism of Real losing Xabi Alonso to Barcelona and Angel di Maria to Manchester United, reports Mundo Deportivo. 

The front page however is a smiling Luis Suarez with a child fighting cancer at the Hospital Sant Joan de Deu Barcelona.
