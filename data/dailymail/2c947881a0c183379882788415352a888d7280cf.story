Bob Willis ponders the punditry style that has seen him consistently ruffle the feathers of the cricket establishment ever since he retired 30 years ago.

‘I’ve never been a fence sitter,’ he says with considerable under-statement. ‘It has got me into hot water at times over the years but I am always looking for an angle that will make people sit up and take notice.

‘It’s easy to describe what has happened but the way I like to come at it is trying to get inside the way people are thinking. So much of international sport is played between the ears and if I’m critical it’s because I’m questioning whether a particular player has the mental grit and strength to rise to the challenge.’

It is a method that has made Willis, at 65, something of a cult figure of Sky’s comprehensive cricket coverage in a niche role that perfectly suits his talents.

He is one of the best fast bowlers England have ever produced but to a whole generation of younger fans he is instead Charles Colvile’s outspoken sidekick on the verdict programmes that follow each day of international cricket.

They have become a formidable partnership. Colvile will set things up and Willis, taking a deep breath and invariably starting with the words ‘Well Charles,’ soon comes steaming in off his long run, knees metaphorically pumping in the inimitable style that earned him legendary status at Headingley in 1981.

‘The verdict has captured people’s imaginations,’ says a man who has proved far more effective in the studio, fixing the viewer with a stare and providing thought-provoking analysis, than in his years in the commentary box.

‘It seems to have struck a cord with people and they can react to it. The format has evolved. It used to be mostly highlights and then a rushed chat but now we have four people dissecting decisions and techniques in far more detail.

‘We often have current players joining us and Charles will always try to eke out the odd dressing room secret while they will do their utmost not to give anything away. He usually gets something out of them.

‘I think it will be very popular during the World Cup because not too many people can sit up all night to watch a whole game. And we will be in an all singing and dancing studio, complete with bells and whistles.’

The last line is delivered dead-pan but with a hint of a smile. Willis is a far more engaging man than many realise, with a dry sense of humour and a warm personality that does not always shine through on screen. But his trenchant, forward thinking, sometimes radical, views have long challenged those in power.

‘I’ve always been a bit of a hot-head and I’ve tried to revolutionise the game from time to time since I retired as a player,’ says Willis. ‘I never got very far sitting on committees because I was just too impatient. They would always want to set up a working party whereas I would want to try to get things done.

‘I do think there is something of a revolution around the corner, or at least an evolution. The success of the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash means that England will have to think very strongly again about franchises for Twenty20 cricket. There is ongoing change at the ECB and the mood for progress will prove irresistible. We might well see an English Premier League before too long.’

It is something he would welcome. ‘England came up with Twenty20 cricket but we have clearly fallen well behind,’ says Willis. ‘How well it has worked in India and Australia is clear for all to see but if we are to adopt something like that here then something will have to give.

Willis also predicts something of an evolution in cricket following the success of the Big Bash 

With ongoing change in Indian and Australian cricket Willis believes the English game has fallen behind

‘We have county captains in Marcus Trescothick and Rob Key in our studio and we talk about how their teams have to play in three different formats of the game in the space of seven or eight days. It can seriously stifle the development of young players. I’ve always been a fan of fewer but more meaningful championship matches with each game having a sense of occasion.’

It is the incredible rise of Twenty20 cricket that Willis believes has had a dramatic effect on the 50-over game and will define the World Cup that begins in exactly a month’s time in Australia and New Zealand.

‘For a while England had a good run in one-day internationals and got to the top of the world rankings a couple of years ago with Alastair Cook and Jonathan Trott to the fore but the game has moved on a pace since then,’ he says.

Willis believes England have failed to move on from their one-day international success  

‘Indian players are getting individual scores of 200 plus in one-day games now and there are light years between them and the way England play.

‘The limited-overs game has changed beyond all recognition. The adage used to be that you would get to 30 overs and then try to double your score in the last 20. But now, because of Twenty20, you must look to score at least a hundred in the last 10 overs and life is pretty tough for bowlers these days.

‘The old fogies in the commentary box will ask why aren’t more yorkers being bowled at the death but just look at what happens now if they get them fractionally wrong. They go out of the ground.’

Conversely, Willis offers hope when asked about England’s World Cup prospects. ‘They will be rank outsiders but every cricket fan will be willing them to do well because of the fresh look about the squad and the new faces who are prepared to take risks. England will have to be fearless but it is an exciting squad in many ways and the key could be how the middle order reacts under pressure.

‘I have sympathy for the selectors in many ways because clearly Paul Downton, Peter Moores and James Whitaker believe Cook is the natural leader of this group and they gave him every chance but it got to the stage where they had to make a change. The ambience under Eoin Morgan will be notably different.

England’s fortunes Down Under will be dissected forensically by Willis, who has been with Sky virtually since their inception but remains as enthusiastic and passionate about English cricket as ever.

‘Sky have worked wonders with broadcasting this game,’ he says. ‘You hear people talking about cricket on free to air television but I’m not sure it’ s realistic for terrestrial channels to cover everything from international to county, women’s and Under 19 cricket. And we will have our own channel for the World Cup. I’m obviously biased but I think Sky are incomparable.

‘I’m not sure the younger generation know much about what Botham and Willis did now and I think we will soon be filed away alongside WG Grace in the dim and distant past. But I think I bring something fresh to the coverage and I’ d like to do it for as long as I can. Long may it continue!’

Well Charles, Bob Willis might be coming off his long run for some time yet.
