A popular British couple who were pillars of their local community have been killed in a horrific crash on holiday in the United States.

Paddy Heazell, 77, and his wife, Julyan, 74, died when their rental van careered off the road and smashed into a tree on Sunday afternoon.

The tragedy happened after the devoted parents and grandparents - married for 51 years - had been hiking in stunning Mount Washington Valley in New Hampshire, New England.

The Heazells were travelling with Paddy’s brother Gareth, 62, who is believed to have been driving the van, and his wife, Pamela, also 62.

They are understood to be recovering in hospital from injuries not thought to be life-threatening but have been left deeply shocked by the crash.

Heartfelt tributes have been pouring in for Mr and Mrs Heazell, of Snape, near Aldeburgh, Suffolk.

The well-known, well-liked couple regularly volunteered to help prestigious local organisation Aldeburgh Music and were passionate supporters of both RSPB Minsmere and Suffolk Wildlife Trust (SWT).

Mr and Mrs Heazell’s three grown-up children were too distraught to comment last night as they tried to come to terms with the devastating accident.

But they released a message through the Rev Canon Nigel Hartley, vicar of Aldeburgh Church, where their parents were married back in 1962 and still played a very active role.

Mr and Mrs Heazell, who also had one grandchild, frequently attended services at the church and sang in the choir.

They were also members of Aldeburgh Music Club.

Mr Heazell was treasurer and concert manager of the club for many years until recently.

Canon Hartley, who had known the couple for the last nine years, said: ‘Paddy and Julyan have been very faithful members of our congregation.

‘Paddy carried the cross for us almost every Sunday in recent years. I have learnt a great deal from him in terms of singing. He was a very talented bass singer.

‘They were involved in so many different aspects of the town and will be greatly missed.’

He added: ‘They were prominent members of so many areas of church life and much loved by all who knew them.

‘They will be very sadly missed by so many people in the congregation because they touched so many lives.

‘Their contributions to the town and church are something that will be remembered for many years.’

A close family friend, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘Paddy and Julyan were two of the kindest, most generous people I have ever met and the gap this leaves in the lives of so many will be enormous.’

Mrs Heazell’s parents, Arthur and Muffet Harrison, were personal friends of iconic composer Benjamin Britten.

Muffet was heavily involved in the early years of the area’s famous Aldeburgh Festival.

It was here that Mrs Heazell met her husband-to-be and the couple carried on the tradition, helping out whenever they could.

Harry Young, general manager at Aldeburgh Music, said: ‘I last saw Paddy 10 days ago. He was giving his time by invigilating an exhibition of printmaking in our gallery - a role normally carried out by new volunteers wishing to become concert hall ushers.

‘That Paddy should be doing this after decades of managing the front of house was entirely typical of such a generous man. He had an almost elder statesman-like role within the 150-strong body of ushers.

‘Paddy would always make a speech at the annual eve-of-festival dinner, where he would entertain and rally the volunteers.

‘We will miss them both hugely - kind, giving, cultured people who played a significant role here and who provided a precious link to the earliest days of the Aldeburgh Festival.’

Mr Heazell was headmaster of top London preparatory school, The Hall, from 1976 to 1991.

He also served as president and chairman of the Independent Association of Prep Schools.

Paddy was a keen local historian and writer.

He featured in his local newspaper, the East Anglian Daily Times, last year after writing the well received The Hidden History of Orford Ness, a secret wartime military weapons~ testing site.

Enthusiastic bird-watcher Mrs Heazell volunteered at RSPB Minsmere nature reserve and was also a leading member of Suffolk Wildlife Trust’s Alde and Blyth local group.

Adam Rowlands, senior site manager at Minsmere, said: ‘Julyan was a valued member of the volunteer team for a number of years, welcoming visitors to the site and providing them with information to enhance their visit.

‘Her interest and passion for the natural world was an inspiration. She was well known locally and will be sadly missed.’

Julian Roughton, chief executive of Suffolk Wildlife Trust, said: ‘They were very active, community-minded people.

‘Julyan had been involved with the trust for nearly 25 years. She was a very warm and enthusiastic person who was just a pleasure to have as a supporter.

‘She was very much involved in her local group and was passionate about helping the trust - both in terms of raising funds and increasing its profile.’
