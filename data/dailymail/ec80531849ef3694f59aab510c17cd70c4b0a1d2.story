Victor Wanyama had to be saved from a mob of angry fans after Kenya were eliminated from African Nations Cup qualifying by minnows Lesotho.

Kenyan fans invaded the pitch at full time after a 0-0 draw, with Wanyama's side having already lost the first leg 1-0.

Police stepped in to escort Wanyama to safety after the Southampton midfielder was targeted by fans. Kenya's coach, Adel Amrouche, was sacked immediately after the game.

Lesotho will now join Uganda, Botswana, Sierra Leone, Malawi, Mozambique and another surprise, Rwanda, in the final group stage of the qualifiers.

Rescued: Southampton's Victor Wanyama had to be saved from angry fans by police after Kenya's match

The seven will now compete with seeded teams like Nigeria, Ivory Coast and Ghana for the 15 places in the tournament, to be played in Morocco early next year.

Morocco has already qualified as host.

The Kenyan federation said hours after the second leg against Lesotho in Nairobi that Algerian coach Adel Amrouche and his staff had all been sacked due to Kenya's 'disastrous elimination.'

'They have let the country down and as such they can have no further role to play in the affairs of the national team with immediate effect,' Football Kenya said.

Amrouche had already been banned for a year by the Confederation of African Football for spitting at a match official in a qualifier earlier this year, a punishment the Kenyan federation was appealing.

Lesotho, a southern African nation of around 2 million people, has never qualified for Africa's top tournament. It'll now compete with Burkina Faso, Angola and Gabon for one of two automatic places at the finals from that group.

Transfer: Wanyama signed for Southampton last summer after an impressive spell in Scotland with Celtic 

Rwanda also upstaged bigger opposition by beating the Republic of Congo 2-0 at home on Saturday to take the tie to a penalty shoot-out. Rwanda won the shoot-out 4-3 as goalkeeper Jean Luc Ndayishimiye saved three penalties in Kigali.

Malawi also won on penalties after John Banda's 15th-minute goal at home levelled the aggregate score against Benin 1-1.

Uganda beat Mauritania 3-0 on aggregate, Botswana beat Guinea-Bissau 3-1, and Mozambique edged Tanzania 4-3 over the two legs after midfielder Domingues' goal in the 83rd minute of the second leg.

Sierra Leone qualified without having to play its second leg against Seychelles when the Indian Ocean island chose to forfeit the match rather than allow Sierra Leone's players to travel because of fears over the spread of the deadly Ebola virus. An Ebola outbreak has caused a public health emergency in Sierra Leone.

The decisive group-stage qualifiers for the 2015 Cup of Nations run from September to November.

Winner: Herve Renard has been appointed Ivory Coast manager, Renard won the African Nations Cup in 2012
