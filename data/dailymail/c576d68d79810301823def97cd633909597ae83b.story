Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho is eyeing a decade of Premier League dominance after signing Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Filipe Luis.

Mourinho splashed out around £80million to bring the trio to Stamford Bridge from La Liga, where Fabregas had been deemed surplus to requirements at Barcelona and Filipe Luis and Diego Costa had just led Atletico Madrid to the league title.

‘A team which has been a winning team for ten seasons is changing step by step, we’ve bought new players and we are trying to build for the next decade,’ said Mourinho, in a press conference at Chelsea’s hotel in Velden, Austria, on Tuesday.

‘Last year we reached the semi-finals and it was a transitional season,’ he added. ‘We had a very young team at the time but, even so, we reached the semi-finals and were playing to win the competition.

‘This season we think we are going to be stronger, the younger players are more experienced, they are stable and better adapted to fighting for titles.’

Despite acknowledging the competitiveness of the English top flight, the 51-year-old said he would not be at Stamford Bridge if he did not think Chelsea could win the Premier League next season.

‘If I didn’t think that way I would go home and let somebody else take charge of the team,’ said the Blues boss.

‘People can speak about other leagues but England is the only country where five or six teams can win the title. Football is about competitiveness every weekend and that only happens in the Premier League.

‘When you have the two Manchester clubs, the three clubs from London – Tottenham, Arsenal and ourselves – plus Liverpool, that’s six top teams, where all of them can win the title. That’s why everybody loves the Premier League.

‘At Chelsea, if we didn’t think we could win the league, or didn’t think we had the quality to do it, we wouldn’t be here working so hard.

‘We respect our opponents and their ambitions, because they have the same ambitions as us, but we want to win the Premier League and we are ready for that.’

A number of Europe’s top clubs have spent
 big this summer, with Barcelona splashing £75m on Luis Suarez and Real 
Madrid recruiting World Cup stars Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez for a 
combined fee of £89m.

Domestically, Arsenal have brought in Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona for £30m, while Liverpool have signed Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Lazar Markovic and Emre Can and Manchester United have shelled out more than £50m on Ander Herrera and Luke Shaw.

Mourinho, who believes this spending will make the Champions League as competitive as ever, says he is focusing on just progressing from the group stages of Europe’s premier competition, before the club can even consider replicating last season’s run to the last four – where they were beaten by Atletico Madrid.

‘You look around, to Spain, Germany and elsewhere in England, teams are getting stronger, spending big amounts of money and trying to sign the best possible players.

‘We will go to the Champions League group stage with one objective: to qualify. When you reach the last 16 let’s see what happens.’

Chelsea play the first game of their pre-season tour of Europe on Wednesday against WAC RZ Pellets.

Mourinho has praised the warm reception he and his squad have been given by local residents in Austria.

‘When we decided we wanted to stay in Europe we had to find the right place to come,’ he explained. ‘Here, everything is good; the hotel, the service, the training ground. To have two training pitches together is important for our work and our organisation.

‘The people are very nice and friendly and they always wait until the end of our training session to ask for an autograph. At this moment everything is very nice for us.’
