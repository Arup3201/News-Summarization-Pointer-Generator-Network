Most of us have no idea a glass of seemingly healthy apple juice contains almost as much sugar as three Krispy Kreme donuts or a bar of Dairy Milk, a survey has found.

With almost seven teaspoons of sugar in a single serving, apple juice contains more than the recommended daily amount for adults who want to stay healthy.  

According to the World Health Organisation, this should be six teaspoons of 'added' sugar - i.e. not that found naturally in products such as milk.

A glass of apple juice (left) contains almost seven teaspoons of sugar, and the average fat-free yogurt (right) contains five. The World Health Organisation recommends no more than six teaspoons of sugar a day

Similarly, a fat-free yogurt - a food also often marketed as a natural, healthy choice - contains five teaspoons of sugar - the same as in three scoops of ice cream.

The high levels of sugar found in everyday – often so-called ‘healthy items’ - were revealed as part of a survey by Bupa.

This asked 2,000 mothers if they were aware of the amount of sugar found in foods they may be giving their children.

In the poll, more than 90 per cent admitted they had no idea about the high levels of sugar in apple juice and fat-free yogurt.

Bupa states the average glass of concentrated apple juice contains nearly seven teaspoons on sugar.

One Krispy Kreme Original glazed donut, on the other hand, contains 10g of sugar - which equates to two teaspoons. 

Nearly half of mothers (46 per cent) admitted they were worried their child might be addicted to sugar.

A survey by Bupa found that 90 per cent of mothers don't know about the high levels of sugar in so-called healthy products like apple juice and fat-free yogurt. A fifth confess their child doesn't eat a balanced diet

But despite their concerns, a fifth confessed their child does not eat a balanced diet.

And 60 per cent admitted they do not regularly look at the nutritional information on food.

Too much sugar in a child’s diet can cause permanent damage to their health, including increased risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. It can also cause tooth decay.

Despite this, 40 per cent of mothers said their children have sweets, fizzy drinks or chocolate at least once a day.

Earlier this year, the World Health Organisation published draft guidelines urging adults to eat no more than 12 teaspoons of sugar a day and to aim for six.

The guideline amount slashed was amid fears sugar poses same threat as tobacco. 

The number of obese British adults is expected to double from one in four to one in two by 2050 – at a cost to the economy of £50billion a year. 

The WHO said the crisis was being fuelled by hidden sugar in processed food and drink such as yogurts, muesli, sauces, fizzy drinks, juice and smoothies. 

However, low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative. 

WHO also said children should try for less than six teaspoons and avoid cans of fizzy drink such as Coke, which contains seven spoons.

Instead five or six teaspoons is the ideal figure that people should aim for. 

Doctors say keeping to a maximum of six teaspoons of sugar a day is key to avoiding obesity, heart disease and other serious illnesses because they fear sugar is as dangerous as tobacco. 

Chief medical officer Sally Davies has already said a tax may be put on calorie-laden food and drink to curb soaring levels of obesity.

Until recently, it was thought that ‘bad drinks’  were those such as Coke and Pepsi, and fruit juice was a healthy alternative helping us get our ‘five a day’.

But increasingly experts are warning that fruit juices and are fuelling the obesity epidemic.

Low-fat foods have also come under fire from experts, after it was revealed they often contain more sugar than the full-fat alternative.

Earlier this year a study found manufacturers are making their ‘healthy’ options more palatable by replacing fat with sugar.

While most low-fat supermarket products contain a third fewer calories than their regular fat version, 10 per cent actually have more or the same calories, mainly due to added sugars.

Obesity specialist Dr Matthew Capehorn said weight-conscious shoppers should realise that choosing low-fat products made by brands including Weight Watchers could hamper their efforts to cut calories. 

Nearly a quarter of mothers said they like putting sugary treats in their child’s lunchbox, with the top culprits being cakes, chocolate and fruit juice.

On top of this, nearly a third of mothers think that as they give their children healthy food, sugar isn’t an issue.

The news comes as NICE announce that schools and nurseries should run tooth brushing schemes to improve children’s teeth.

As many as one in eight children now suffer tooth decay by the age of three – although in some parts of England the rates are as high as a third.

Sugar Puffs (pictured in their current form) will be being rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' and will contain less sugar and 20 per cent more honey

Sugar Puffs are being given a makeover in an attempt to address parents' concerns about the amount of sugar in the cereal - and revive plunging sales.

Rebranded as 'Honey Monster Puffs' after the yellow furry character featured in previous adverts, they will be made from a new recipe with less sugar and 20 per cent more honey.

The cereal will also feature traffic light nutritional labelling on the front of the pack, in a move manufacturers Halo Foods said would allow customers to make 'informed decisions' about what they eat for breakfast.

Overall, manufacturers say the sugar content has been reduced by a third in a decade.

Honey Monster Puffs will contain 8.6g of sugar – a cube and a half – in a 30g portion, down from the previous recipe which contained almost two cubes per portion.

However critics say the move is largely a marketing ploy - as once broken down, honey and added sugar become the same thing - glucose. 

Dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline: 'Added sugar and honey are grouped in the same category by the UK Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition.

'Although honey is seen as more "natural" than added sugar, it is still counted as a "free sugar" - i.e. one that has been added to a product rather than say lactose, a sugar found naturally in milk.

'Once broken down in the body, honey will do exactly the same thing as the added sugar would have.'
