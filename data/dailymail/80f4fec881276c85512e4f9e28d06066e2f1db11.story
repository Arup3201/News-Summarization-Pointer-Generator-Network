'Too glamorous': Gabby Logan has spoken out in a
Radio Times interview about the trials she has faced in 
the male-dominated world of sports journalism

Sports presenter Gabby Logan has slammed Sky Sports for using female presenters as 'window dressing'.

She suggested that Sky Sports - where 
she first cut her teeth on TV - played on the looks of female presenters
but failed to give them a 'career path'.

Asked
in a Radio Times interview about how the broadcaster appears to use 
some women as 'window dressing', Miss Logan said: 'The girls are 
basically wearing a leotard while the bloke's in a suit and a tie.

'It's
fine if they're given a career path but there have never been any big 
breakthrough women on Sky. We all have to go to other places.'

In the interview the TV personality claims she was once chided by a superior at the BBC for looking 'too glamorous' after he spotted her sporting a pair of high-heeled boots.

The presenter, who has occasionally faced criticism herself for how she appears on screen, said she does not want to distract people from sport but wants to look her best.

The 40-year-old sports presenter defended
her glossy appearance on screen, saying that viewers want to see 
something 'aspirational' on their television screens.

'A boss at the BBC once told me that I was too glamorous and pointed to my high-heeled boots. I said, 'I've just come from a radio show, it's what I wear',' she said.

'He said, "You don't wear them when you do the dishes, do you?" Does he want me to look like I'm doing the dishes? I'm not here to look like a housewife.

'If I'm at home in my pyjamas I want to see something a bit more aspirational on TV. It's right that people on primetime look after their appearance.'

Ms Logan, one of the BBC's key presenters during last year's Olympics coverage, is soon to be seen in a new BBC1 panel show I Love My Country and wants to broaden her scope into more entertainment programmes.

'The Games showed that sport is a very good grounding. It probably opened doors. I want to try lots of other areas,' she said.

'I'm not saying I want to be the next natural history presenter, but I'm 40 years old. I don't want to get to 58 and think, "Oh, I should have tried that".'

Ms Logan and co-presenter Dominic Holyer on Sky Sports in 1996: She suggested that the broadcaster, where she began her career, played on the looks of female presenters but failed to give them a 'career path'

In response to Ms Logan's comments Sky Sports insisted its presenters are there on merit and that many have built successful careers at the broadcaster.

'While we respect Gabby's opinion and her work, we're surprised by the comments as there are many talented women who have developed successful presenting or reporting careers at Sky Sports,' a spokesman said

'They include trained journalists, passionate and knowledgeable about sport, who work on our most high-profile sports including football, golf, cricket and Formula 1.'

'And there are a huge number of female colleagues working behind the scenes, including 30 per cent of the production team at Sky Sports News.

'It would be disrespectful to those women if we didn't challenge the idea that they are there for any reason other than merit.'
