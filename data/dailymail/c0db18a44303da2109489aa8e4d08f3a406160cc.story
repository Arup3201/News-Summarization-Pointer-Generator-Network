Bayern Munich boss Pep Guardiola has admitted that Manchester United target Toni Kroos could leave the club before Friday's transfer window deadline.

The midfielder reacted angrily after being substituted during his side's dramatic 2-1 comeback win against Stuttgart on Wednesday, fuelling speculation that he will head for the Munich exit.

United boss David Moyes, who was pictured speaking to executive vice chairman - and chief transfer negotiator - Ed Woodward during training on Thursday, is prepared to offer £25million for the Germany star, as revealed by Sportsmail on Tuesday.

Speaking after his side's victory, Guardiola said: 'He (Kroos) is an important player but things can move fast in football.

'Here today, gone tomorrow.'

Kroos threw his gloves to the ground on his walk to the dugout after being replaced by Claudio Pizarro in the 60th minute against Stuttgart.

Pizarro grabbed Bayern's equaliser 16 minutes after coming on, before Thiago Alcantara executed a perfect scissor kick to secure three points in added time.

Moyes watched Kroos in action against Borussia Monchengladbach last Friday night and after the game the midfielder admitted there were no plans for further talks on renewing a 
contract that runs out at the end of next season and he was in the dark 
over his future.

Kroos deal: Manchester United are keen to sign £25million-rated Bayern Munich midfielder Toni Kroos

It was
 thought he was looking for a pay rise that might cause unrest in the 
Bayern dressing room after chief executive Karl-Heinz Rummenigge 
admitted talks were deadlocked and ruefully added that it was ‘always 
about money in these negotiations.’

But Sportsmail understands the figure presented to Allianz Arena bosses is around £150,000 a week, half the weekly £300,000 dangled before Wayne Rooney to extend his Old Trafford stay.

Kroos evidently believes he is well worth a salary that would edge him nearer top earners like Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Franck Ribery and is prepared to stick to his guns.

Though talks have ground to a halt, Bayern are reluctant to sell and will ask for at least £25million, should they sense there is a danger of Kroos running down his current deal.

With United’s midfield still in need of strengthening, even after the arrival of Juan Mata, Moyes is unlikely to be deterred and will surely be encouraged by a clear signal he would have little difficulty keeping Kroos happy on the pay front.

Sportsmail exclusively revealed on Saturday that Moyes, and assistants Steve Round and Phil Neville, had been met outside Monchengladbach’s ground on Friday night by one of Kroos’ advisers, Sascha Breese, who escorted them inside and sat with them throughout the game against Bayern.

Sports Total, for whom Breese works, have since tried to play down claims that Kroos could be heading for Old Trafford, but Moyes has promised more significant signings before the window closes and has the 24-year old in his sights.
