A teacher has been suspended after reportedly throwing a bucket of water on a couple of teens he caught kissing and hugging in a school corridor.

The unnamed teacher was placed on administrative leave while officials look into the incident at a Nashville High School.

But he appeared unrepentant about his actions in a Facebook posting saying his actions 'seemed to work' and caused the couple to break off their affectionate embrace.

Cold shower: A Nashville teacher is accused of throwing a bucket of cold water on two students showing affection in the school hallway

The teacher wrote:'(I) got in trouble at school today. (I) threw a bucket of water on two kids h*****g in the hallway of the high school where I plan to send my oldest daughter next year.  

‘It seemed to work and they stopped.  Keep me in your prayers peeps.'

But the mother of one of the teens hit out at the water treatment suffered by her 16-year-old son and his 17-year-old girlfriend at John Overton High School in Nashville, Tennessee, WKRN-TV reported.

Maggie Tiefenthal, the mother of the teenage boy who was supposedly doused, said the teacher's actions were inexcusable.

She claimed her son was only hugging his girlfriend and insisted the teacher could have asked her son to leave the corridor rather than drench them with water.

She said: 'They are not dogs.  That is what you do to dogs and they are not animals,' she said, adding, '(My son) was embarrassed.  He was upset. He was raging.'

Admittance: The teacher wrote about the act on his Facebook page and said the tactic seemed to work at separating the two

Ms Tiefenthal said the girl's parents were also angry at the way she had been treated.

The school immediately suspended the teacher and spoke with the parents of both teens.

The bucket water incident was captured on CCTV cameras that are placed in the school's corridor.

Ms Tiefenthal said the school principal had viewed the video but she had yet to see it.

She said: 'The administrator said based on the video, the kids did nothing inappropriate. Nothing. Miss Morton, the assistant principal, she saw it. Yes, they all saw the video'

Ms Tiefenthal said the teacher has made matters worse by posting about the incident on his Facebook page.

'What you did is wrong, but worse, you put it on Facebook and made fun of two teenagers,' she said.

School district spokesperson Olivia Brown said that the school has not had a problem with the teacher in the past.

She told WKRN: 'This teacher is a good teacher in good standing, there are no concerns in the past, apparently he did this while at school and he is on administrative leave, the matter is being investigated by employee relations.'
