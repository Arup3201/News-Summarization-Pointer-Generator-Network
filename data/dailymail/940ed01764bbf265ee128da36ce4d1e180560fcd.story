FIFA president Sepp Blatter is staying away from the United States because he doesn’t want to be questioned by the FBI about World Cup bid corruption, according to a high-ranking football insider.

The astonishing claim comes as America’s national crime investigators are making their own inquiries about the murky process around the awarding of the 2018 and 2022 tournaments to Russia and Qatar respectively.

Globetrotter Blatter has only set foot in the USA once since those controversial World Cup votes in Zurich in December 2010, despite America becoming a rapidly growing marketplace for football in the intervening years.

Blatter’s last brief visit was for the CONCACAF Congress in Miami in May 2011. Before that there was a four-day trip in July 2009, when he watched the Gold Cup final between the USA and Mexico in New York and had an audience with President Obama at the White House.

The FIFA delegation that accompanied Blatter to meet Obama included then CONCACAF president Jack Warner, since exposed as the biggest rogue on the FIFA ExCo. Warner has now resigned all his football positions.

The FBI’s own World Cup probe has involved warning Phaedra Al-Majid, the American former press officer for the Qatar 2022 bid, that she is in danger. Al-Majid, who alleges Qatar’s bid was corrupt, has been offered protection.

Federal agents turned discredited FIFA ExCo member Chuck Blazer, faced with a bill for millions of dollars in unpaid tax, to act as an informant. Blazer reportedly used a key-fob bugging device to record meetings with colleagues at the London 2012 Olympics.

FIFA would not comment about Blatter allegedly wanting to avoid the FBI but said he tended to only visit countries for specific tournaments or football-related activities.

There is understood to be angst inside Liverpool at how diligently their crocked star striker Daniel Sturridge goes about the daily grind of rehab exercises. 

The belief is that Sturridge didn’t give himself the best chance of avoiding another injury — such as the thigh strain he has suffered — when he returned to training six weeks after damaging the same thigh on England duty.

FIFA president Sepp Blatter, in his letter to FA chairman Greg Dyke, cites Swiss law to explain why Zurich-based FIFA would not be able to publish Michael Garcia’s report on World Cup bid corruption in full.

However Brian Cookson, the British president of cycling’s world body UCI — located in Aigle, Switzerland — intends to be totally transparent over his sport’s independent probe into chronic doping problems, due out in February. Cookson wants everything published apart from witness statements where confidentiality was agreed.

Meanwhile, the Olympic reforms to be rubber-stamped in Monaco next month will see Blatter having to step down from the Olympic governing body on reaching 80 in March 2016, when he will be less than a year into a ridiculous fifth term at the FIFA helm.

North Korea, the most reclusive nation on Earth, are bidding to host a World Weightlifting Championships. This follows the communist state finishing top of the medal table at this month’s event in Kazakhstan. The Koreans’ success has sparked allegations of doping but only one of their weightlifters is banned and out-of-competition testers have been allowed into the country.

Peers win touts fight

A cross-party alliance of sporting peers in the House of Lords have shown up the toothless Department for Culture, Media and Sport by defeating the Government over secondary- market ticket touting.

Colin Moynihan, Tanni Grey-Thompson and Rachel Heyhoe-Flint secured the amendment in the Consumer Rights Bill, which will demand far greater transparency over online ticket-selling — if it becomes law.

Ticket-trading websites will have to show the location of the seat, the identity of the seller and the ticket’s terms and conditions — hopefully in time for the Rugby World Cup next autumn.

England Rugby 2015 have been campaigning for this much-needed reform but have been frustrated by a lack of impetus at the DCMS.
