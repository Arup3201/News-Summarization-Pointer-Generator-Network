Australians may be allowed to purchase cars online from overseas dealers  under a radical new plan put forward by the federal government.

The plan, which is expected to draw backlash from local car dealerships, would allow Australians to import their own cars as long as they were aligned with accepted international safety standards.

The Coalition wants to remove current red tape and barriers that restrict people from buying new cars from overseas in a move that would aim to deregulate the automotive market for consumers.

It comes as new car sales figures released on Wednesday showed demand for new cars had dropped 5.5 percent compared with last August.

A discussion paper from the government says a review of the Motor Vehicle Standards Act needs to occur to stay updated with changes to the international automotive market, considering it was last reviewed 14 years ago.

The Motor Vehicle Standards Act delivers national vehicle standards for new motor vehicles and regulates the first supply of used imported vehicles to the Australian market.

'At the moment there are certain schemes for importation, but it is very difficult and complicated and very bureaucratic,' Assistant Infrastructure Minister Jamie Briggs told The Australian. .

Assistant Infrastructure Minister Jamie Briggs said certain schemes for importation were difficult and complicated, with only about 3,000 cars getting imported by individuals each year

There's currently only about 3,000 cars that get imported in Australia by individuals each year - people can't import their own vehicles unless they're given special approval. 

'Why shouldn't consumers have the option to do that if there is no good safety reason why they can’t? There would be an element of buyer beware that people will need to be conscious of; it is a big purchase to buy something sight unseen.'

The government's plan would give consumers access to vehicles at the lowest possible cost, including luxury vehicles, and would be from markets with right-hand drive vehicles like Britain, Japan, Indonesia, Thailand and India.

The discussion paper considers a range of reform options including ideas put forward by the Productivity Commission in its Report on Australia's Automotive Manufacturing Industry.

The Productivity Commission's proposal to reduce restrictions on second-hand imports is canvassed in the paper.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe signed an economic partnership agreement back in July, which would see a reduced cost in Japanese cars.

Australian Automobile Association chief Andrew McKellar said Japan was the largest source of imported vehicles in Australia and made up about 30 per cent of the market.

'We would estimate [the trade deal] would reduce the amount of tax payable on a new car by about $1000 to $2000,' Mr McKellar told Daily Mail Australia.

'For a larger vehicle like a [Toyota] Land Cruiser the saving is probably closer to $3000.'
