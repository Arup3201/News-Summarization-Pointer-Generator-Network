The mayor of Belfast has hit back at a Game of Thrones TV executive who said that the city - where much of the series is filmed - is 'not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half the year'.

HBO, the company behind Game Of Thrones, based on the novels of George RR Martin, works closely with the city to encourage visitors to Northern Ireland.

The filming locations feature prominently on websites promoting Belfast as a travel destination.

HBO's president of programming Michael Lombardo said Belfast, where much of Game of Thrones is filmed, is 'not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half the year'. Belfast Mayor Nichola Mallon defended the city

There is even a Game of Thrones exhibit in the city, where visitors can see props and costumes from the show.

But HBO's president of programming Michael Lombardo told U.S. magazine Vulture that producers Dan B Weiss and David Benioff were struggling to adapt to life there.

He said: 'It's a little bit of a personal challenge I don't think they contemplated when we initially found our location in Belfast, what that meant for them personally... Belfast is not the most cosmopolitan of cities to spend half of the year.'

A key scene involving Stannis Baratheon and his otherworldly advisor Lady Melisandre was filmed on the Londonderry beach

He added: 'I don't think they have a hard time, but the good news is work keeps them busy, let's just say that.'

Belfast's new Lord Mayor Nichola Mallon defended her city, saying it has been transformed and much to offer holidaymakers.

'I don't want to get drawn into attacking HBO, who are doing a lot for Northern Ireland, but I think Belfast is a very vibrant city,' she told the Belfast Telegraph.

'We can see from our visitor numbers that
 it is going from strength to strength. There is a lot about Belfast 
which is there to be showcased and celebrated.'

Many of the scenes portraying Pyke, homeland of the treacherous Theon Greyjoy and sister Yara, were filmed in Northern Ireland

Atmospheric: Ballintoy Harbour was used for the fictional town of Pyke in the second season

Northern Ireland's epic coastline has provided an ideal backdrop for filming the wildly successful series

Filming locations familiar to viewers include Downhill Beach in Londondery, a beautiful stretch of shore that stood in for Dragonstone, seat of the Baratheon family.

It was where Stannis Baratheon, one of the nobles vying for the throne of the Kingdom of Westeros, burned the old gods under the influence of the red priest Melisandre.

Other locales include Ballintoy Harbour in Country Antrim, which was used to show Pyke, home of the fierce Iron Islanders, and Castle Ward in County Down, which acted as Winterfell, home of the Starks.

HBO also has a studio in the city and is gearing up to partially film the next season there.
