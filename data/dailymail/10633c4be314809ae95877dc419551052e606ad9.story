A Sri Lankan asylum seeker has died after suffering what are believed to be 'self-inflicted' burns to 90 per cent of his body.

He was understood to have doused himself in petrol before setting himself alight at a busy Geelong intersection.

The 29-year-old feared being sent back to Sri Lanka, a spokesman for the Tamil Refugee Council told The Age.

Leo Seemanpillai had been living in Australia on a bridging visa since January 2013.

Scared: Leo Seemanpillai had been living in Australia on a bridging visa since January 2013. He died on Saturday night

Immigration Minister Scott Morrison confirmed that the Tamil man, who was living in Geelong, Victoria, died of his injuries on Saturday night.

Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam, who was at Mr Seemanpillai's hospital bedside on Saturday night, said he had known him for 13 months.

'He feared for his life if he was returned to Sri Lanka,' Mr Mylvaganam said.

Both of Mr Seemanpillai's parents lived in a refugee camp in India, where he had also spent time.

They are reported to be in shock over their son's death.

Trevor Grant, a convenor at the Tamil Refugee Council, revealed that Mr Seemanpillai suffered depression after fleeing Sri Lanka about five years ago.

'He knew that if he was sent back he'd face persecution from the military,' Mr Grant explained.

He also said the asylum seeker was on the organ donor register and five people have received his organs after his death on Saturday.

A Victoria Police spokeswoman says officers were called to a unit fire in inner suburban Newtown on Saturday morning following reports a man was on fire in the front yard.

It's believed the injuries were self-inflicted, she said.

'I'm advised by my department that a man believed to be an illegal maritime arrival of Sri Lankan nationality suffered serious burns in an incident in Geelong yesterday morning, I understand he died of his injuries overnight,' Mr Morrison told the ABC.

Emergency services rushed the man to Geelong Hospital after hearing reports a man who was on fire near the intersection of Cairns St and West Fyans St after 10.30am.

Mr Seemanpillai was then flown to The Alfred hospital in a critical condition where he died.

Mr Morrison said the man arrived at Darwin in January 2013 before being granted a bridging visa in May, and again in July.

Ambulance Victoria spokesman John Mullen said bystanders tried to help the man when he ran from the unit.

'He was seen running out into the street on fire. Bystanders have tried to douse the flames with water,' Mr Mullen told AAP on Sunday.

He said Mr Seemanpillai suffered full thickness burns to most of his body.

The minister extended the government's sympathies to the man's friends and overseas-based family.

'The department and its Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme provider are working with the hospital and community, with members of the family also to make funeral arrangements...

'Those who were close to him in the community would be aware of this incident and they are also, to the extent that they are asylum seekers in the community on bridging visas, receiving the necessary support.'

Police are investigating the incident.
