The world's most famous paintings have been recreated using just a torch.

Light artist Michael Bosanko completed his collection of copies of masterpieces last week, with his take on René Magritte's 'The Son of Man'.

Bosanko, from Caerphilly, South Wales, painstakingly drew every brush stoke with a torch, using long exposure to photograph his creations.

Enlightened: Light artist Michael Bosanko has recreated Da Vinci's Vitruvian Man using just a torch and a camera on long exposure

Original: Da Vinci's pen and ink sketch is a careful study of the anatomy of man based on the ideal human proportions described by Ancient Roman scholar Vitruvius

The Scream: Bosanko has recreated Edvard Munch's 1893 masterpiece using the Brecon Beacons as the background for his light image

The artist, who has been creating 
light images since 2004, said: 'The idea behind 'illuminating famous 
artists' was to look at various styles across the centuries, and apply 
what I do in different ways.

'Interpreting famous pieces of art 
from entirely different artists was about as challenging as things could
get. I just had to give it a shot.

'I light paint by using a long 
exposure, and have no visual trace to reference from as I'm 'painting' 
in the dark in a three dimensional space.'

The series was shot entirely in the Brecon Beacons and includes Munch's The Scream, Banksy's The Balloon Girl, Da 
Vinci's Vitruvian Man, Van Gogh's The Starry Night, 
Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa and Magritte's The Son of Man.

The copy of Van Gogh's 1889 oil 
painting was created using the longest exposure, with Bosanko leaving 
the shutter open for more than 20 minutes.

Making waves: The Welsh artist has copied Katsushika Hokusais's The Great Wave off Kangawa using strokes of blue and white light

Masterpiece: The Japanese artist's original image, which is also known simply as The Wave, was a woodblock print created in the 1830s

Tribute: Bosanko used a deserted bridge in the Welsh hills as the setting for his version of Banksy's 2003 graffitti work The Balloon Girl

He added: 'It's difficult to pick a 
favourite because I love them all for different reasons. I think the Van
Gogh interpretation has the slight edge. I love the original, and is 
was a difficult image to complete.

'The overall reaction has been surprisingly phenomenal; quite humbling, actually.'

In the past nine years, Bosanko has 
exhibited and created light art around the world and has been 
commissioned to make pieces for companies like Orange and British 
Airways.

Incredibly Mr Bosanko has to visualise the image he wants to create after observing the setting and then rely on memory to light-paint.

Speaking earlier this year he explained the process. 'In real time, I leave the camera's exposure open,' he said. 'While the camera is exposing for up an hour, I step into the scene and move light sources in a way that is captured on the camera's sensor.

'In real time, the casual viewer will only see me moving lights about in what seems a random fashion. All the while the camera's sensor is picking up the trails of light, and recording real time in one still image.

Night sky: This recreation of Van Gogh's Starry Night was the most complex of the set of images the Welsh artist created and needed the longest exposure, with the camera shutter open for more than 20 minutes

The Starry Night: Vincent Van Gogh's painting shows the night-time view from the window of the sanitorium in Saint-Remy-de-Provence where he was living in 1889

Apple of his eye: Bosanko's version of Rene Magritte's The Son of Man focuses on the apple at the centre of the painting and the stormy clouds above

'I need to rely on memory and spatial
awareness to create the images because while I am in motion. I cannot 
see how the image is going to be until the absolute end.'

'Some people have asked if I have ever
used photo-shop on my work and I have to tell them that it is simply 
created with a torch, a camera and the canvas of the night.'

The 43-year-old first discovered his 
passion for light art after he accidentally knocked over a tripod while 
taking a photo on a holiday in Greece and noticed how the moon had made a
streak through the image.

Ever since, he has been obsessed with 
using light to paint and uses empty urban and rural locations at night 
as the setting for his works.

Speaking about his latest project, 
Bosanko said: 'This has been a shift from my usual style, so I didn't 
know what to expect. I'm happy with what I achieved, and am pleased 
other people are on board with that.'
