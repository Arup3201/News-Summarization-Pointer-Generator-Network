Sam Allardyce appears to have done a U-turn by claiming he wants Ravel Morrison to stay at West Ham - providing his injury problems and wage demands can be managed.

Hammers co-owner David Sullivan had previously said that the mercurial midfielder was not wanted by the manager, telling talkSPORT: 'Sam has said Ravel is not part of his plans but we as a board see him as part of our plans.'

Allardyce now seems to support the club's view after insisting the 21-year-old still has a role to play, especially if he recovers from the hernia problems that plagued him last season.

'He's contracted to West Ham,' Allardyce told reporters.

'I
 think he's had a hernia op. Once that's healed up I hope he becomes a 
better player because he has been playing with it for a while. The 
groins have been causing him a problem for a while.

'If you've 
got pain, I don't think you perform to your best. Hopefully that pain 
will have ended and he'll be a much freer, more active player for us. If
 he could do what he did last season, that would be great because, when 
he broke in to the side early last year, he had a great spell. 
Unfortunately he couldn't sustain it.'

The England Under 21 player made a bright start to his career at Upton Park before fading out and spending the latter half of the season on loan to QPR.

Allardyce is willing to give the talented youngster another chance, but added that Morrison's wage demands would influence his future at the east London club.

'If he continues to do what he did last season then yes [we want to keep him] but that does depend on how much players want, how much they demand. If that demand is far too great then that becomes a difficulty for us.'
