If Harry the spaniel looks less than impressed, it may be because he doesn’t know he’s at the forefront of a revolution in dog grooming.

(Actually, it’s probably because, like most dogs, he hates being washed, but bear with us...)

Harry is pictured in the middle of having a blueberry facial, the latest thing in canine pampering said to be a big hit among celebrities and their pets in – where else? – Los Angeles.

Spruce up your Spaniel: Harry in the middle of his pampering

The £39.95 treatment is offered in Britain at the Pet Spa in Chelsea and features the mutt’s face being smeared in a mixture of blueberries, oatmeal, honey and yoghurt.

If you think that sounds more like a breakfast than a beauty treatment, you’re not alone – Harry was certainly keen to give the concoction a taste.

Salon owner Stephanie Mehanna, 45, said: ‘The biggest trend in LA recently has been the blueberry facial for dogs. It isn’t available over here so we decided to make our own.

‘The facial is made up of oatmeal and blueberries which acts as exfoliation and helps to reduce tear stains on the fur around the eyes.

‘We feel the blueberry facial works best as part of a package, and helps to groom the coat.’

Her spa’s ‘deluxe face and body treatment’ package starts with a milk bath, a solution made up of orange, lavender and dried milk, followed by the blueberry facial, which is applied across the nose and the soft fur under the eyes.

An all-over carrot and banana body mask is then used to work through the fur and on to the skin to help with exfoliation, using the course texture of the carrot and the natural moisturisers in bananas to do this.

Then the coat is glossed over with a rosemary and cider mix which acts like a finishing solution on the fur.

Miss Mehanna’s spa is believed to be the first to offer a ‘Deluxe face and body treatment’ package which includes a Cleopatra orange and lavender milk wash followed by the blueberry facial. A nourishing carrot and banana body mask before finally being treated with a rosemary and cider coat shine.

Add-ons such as a ‘Wash and Fluff’ dog groom which, depending on the size of your breed, will range from £45.99 to £75.99 a session.

All the ingredients used in the cleansing are natural and have been sourced in the UK, they are then mixed in house and made into treatments.

Other treatments at the salon include the first ever ‘Blow Dry Bar’ for owners and their pooches.

Clients can sip on champagne while their much-loved pets have their fur blow-dried and enjoy a mineral water.

Other treatments include the ‘Deluxe paw-dicure’ which allows the paws to be soaked in rose water and then they are coated in olive oil and coconut body butter for £29.95.

Many dog owners, who only want the best for their canine friends, will hire in artistic director and top stylist Dione Spice who will groom and shape their coats for up to £125.95.

Most treatments to prove successful or beneficial have to be repeated every four to six weeks.

They also offer a crèche for the precious pets, from 8:30am until 6pm, which includes a walk and is priced at £650 per month, or £25 per day.
