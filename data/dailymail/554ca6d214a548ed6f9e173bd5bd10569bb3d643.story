Pizza Hut is rolling out a new, pizza-sized chocolate chip cookie Monday in the hopes that the gooey desert will attract more young customers to the national chain.

At almost eight inches in diameter, sliced into eight pieces, the product's official name is the Ultimate Hershey's Chocolate Chip Cookie.

But Pizza Hut insiders have their own name: the 'pizza cookie.'

Restaurant reps say this is the kind of menu item that will bring in the 18 to 34-year-olds. 

'Millennials tell us 
it's what they want,' Carrie Walsh, chief marketing officer at 
Pizza Hut, told USA Today. 'They like to cap off a great pizza with a great dessert."  
Customers who buy it with a pizza get it for $4.99 — solo it goes for 
$5.99. And, of course, they'll be available along with pizza for warm 
delivery.'

Desserts have been big winners for the $39 billion pizza industry in recent years.

Dominos has cinnamon sticks and Papa Johns has apple pies.

Approximately 70 per cent of polled customers said they wanted a post-pizza dessert, Walsh said.

Taking a page from hookah sales, which have also spiked among young consumers, the pizza cookie is an experience that can be shared.

'You never get a pizza for yourself,' said Steve Green, publisher of PMQ Pizza Magazine. 'Now, you 
take a chocolate chip cookie and make it communal — and you've got a 
party.'

Pizza Hut already has some dessert offerings, adding cinnamon sticks to the menu in 2003 and adding Hershey chocolate dunkers (a chocolate-covered dipping stick) in 2008.

If the new addition is a hit, Hershey, which owns Reese's Pieces, may start adding the bite-sized peanut butter candies to future menu items.

All that's left is to make sure every restaurant has milk.

'We have it in some locations now,' Walsh. 'But we may have to go to 100%.'
