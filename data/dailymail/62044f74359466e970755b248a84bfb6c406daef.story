Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance

The first known works by one of Britain's finest composers, Sir Hubert Parry, who wrote the music for Jerusalem, are being sold at auction.

The 70 documents, expected to fetch up to £50,000, represent Parry's earliest surviving work and include pieces written when he was an Eton schoolboy and at Oxford.

Many of the pieces have never been played in public, but a premiere before the Prince of Wales, a champion of Parry's music, is to take place in May. 

Parry is considered one of the country's most influential musicians and a key architect of the 19th Century English Musical Renaissance.

As well as Jersualem, he wrote many famous settings for English hymns, including Repton, a well-known tune for Dear Lord And Father Of Mankind.

Parry's setting of the anthem I Was Glad has been played at the Coronations of every Monarch since Edward VII and was performed at the Westminster Abbey wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana in 1981. 

In a BBC4 documentary about Parry's music, Charles said: 'It gives you tingles up the spine and tears in your eyes.'

Parry's version of The Magnificat And Nunc Dimittis In D, and an anthem entitled O Sing Unto The Lord, are considered the best of the cache and will be sung for the first time by the choir at Gloucester Cathedral.

Leading institutions and potential buyers, including Prince Charles, have been sent details of the auction at Chorley's, Gloucester, on May 19.

It is an appropriate venue because Sir Charles Hubert Hastings Parry (1848-1918) grew up just two miles from Gloucester, where he learned to play the organ.

Adrian Partington, the cathedral's director of music, who examined all the manuscripts and chose the two pieces for the premiere, said: 'The pieces are beautifully well-written for his age and show a talented young composer, but they are not exceptional. I think he was writing stuff for his chums to perform at Eton and Oxford and he did it in a hurry.

'They were probably only performed informally around the piano and I suspect he just forgot about them, which is why they have been gathering dust for all these years.

'But the seeds of a great composition like Jerusalem can be found in this student work. These are beautifully shaped tunes, logical harmony and very exact but imaginative setting of the words.'

Some are incomplete or jottings, but there are some important compositions which until recently were kept in storage by one of Parry's distant relatives.

In later life, Parry went on to teach and later run the Royal College of Music in London, which has an archive of his work.

Dr Peter Horton, a librarian at the college, said: 'The new documents are interesting because they are his early works and one can see from them how Parry's work developed.'
