The barrister who came second to George Clooney's fiancé  in a poll of London's hottest lawyers today revealed her battle with breast cancer.

Marianne Butler, a commercial lawyer, was dealt the devastating blow on September 26 last year, just a month after she was named runner-up to Amal Alamuddin.

The 35-year-old told the Evening Standard she has since endured rounds of chemotherapy and pioneering drug therapy at the Royal Marsden hospital.

She joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer.

A month after being voted London's second hottest barrister, Marianne Butler, was diagnosed with grade III breast cancer

Ms Butler, left before treatment, came second in the Your Barrister Boyfriend poll of hottest female briefs in the capital last summer. She was second only to George Clooney's fiance Amal Alamuddin, right

'I was laughing about it at the time. Generally speaking you either do laugh at dark things or you don't, and I tend to.'

While pictures of Miss Alamuddin out with Clooney appeared on websites, in papers and magazines last Autumn, Ms Butler was in the midst of treatment.

After doctors discovered a 6cm tumour, detecting the disease in Ms Butler's lymph nodes, she was referred on to a groundbreaking trial at the Marsden.

Despite having no family history of the disease, Ms Butler was told her cancer was grade III, with doctors warning she must start chemotherapy just four days later.

She was given the drugs pertuzumab and Herceptin, a combination previously only trialled in the U.S.

The drugs worked to stop the cancer cells from communicating with other cells in the body, preventing it from spreading while treatment worked.

And the treatment, performed by Professor
 Ian Smith, was a success, destroying the disease, allowing Mrs Butler 
to return to work at the Fountain Court Chambers.

Ms Butler joked: 'Number one got George Clooney, number two got breast cancer'

Mrs Butler's husband Tony told MailOnline: 'The key innovation in Marianne’s treatment was the use of pertuzumab straight away.

'Prior
 to her diagnosis it was only given for second occurrences or to people 
with Stage 4 cancer.  Concurrently with Marianne's diagnosis - just a 
few days afterwards - the FDA in the U.S. approved pertuzumab for use as
 a first step to shrink a tumour before the main treatment.

'This was following exceptional results during a trial.

'Professor
 Smith was not only able to get permission to give pertuzumab to 
Marianne for a first occurrence of breast cancer, but persuaded our 
insurance company of the benefits such that they agreed to pay for it.'

He added that Marianne was the first 
person at the Royal Marsden -'and so probably in the country)' - to 
receive herceptin and pertuzumab as a joint attack on a primary breast 
cancer. 

She is still taking both drugs to try and prevent any recurrence, so continues to be monitored for side effects.

Two of the other drugs which Marianne took during the course of her treatment were developed by Professor Smith and his team.

Mrs Butler underwent a new drug regime, which her family believe was key to her recovery

They are currently trialling a new 
monoclonal antibody drug, which is intended to direct the chemotherapy 
drugs to only attack the offending cancer cells, thereby sparing the 
patient the gruelling side effects of chemotherapy.

'It is truly groundbreaking stuff,' added Mr Butler.

To raise money for the Marsden, her husband Tony and brother Julian Post joined by Professor Smith and 30 friends, are preparing to take on a charity cycle ride taking in four of the Tour de France's toughest mountains.

The event, known as Le Cure De France, will take place from September 10 to 14.

Their aim is to collect £100,000 to help other patients benefit from Professor Smith's work.

Ms Butler, who lives in Barnes, said: 'I have been very lucky. This is now about the Marsden and other women. That is what these guys are cycling for.
