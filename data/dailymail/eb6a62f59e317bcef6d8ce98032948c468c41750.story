Sam Williams  scored a last-minute try to guide Catalan Dragons to a shock 24-20 win at Leeds and into the last six of the Super League play-offs.

It was the French side’s first win at Headingley in 10 attempts and Laurent Frayssinous described it as the finest moment of his coaching career.

‘We made history by becoming the first Catalan team to win at Leeds,’ said Frayssinous. ‘To win that type of game, it is pretty special.’

The Dragons’ reward is a trip to Huddersfield in Friday’s preliminary semi-final, with the Giants hoping to bounce back from a 57-4 hammering at Wigan.

‘We will stay humble,’ Frayssinous said. ‘We have never performed at Huddersfield so it will be a tough one again. But we know what we can do now.’

Warrington’s 22-19 play-off win over Widnes was marred by a terrible injury to Matty Russell.

The full-back was carried off on a stretcher in the second half after a sickening collision with Macgraff Leuluai and was taken straight to hospital. The injury looked appalling — Russell was unconscious and had blood pouring from his nose and mouth — yet the player last night said he would be fine.

He tweeted: ‘Been quite lucky scans are all good neck and head. Teeth knocked out n bad lip. Part and parcel of playing.’

Warrington, 18 points down at one stage, were inspired by a hat-trick of tries from Joel Monaghan.
