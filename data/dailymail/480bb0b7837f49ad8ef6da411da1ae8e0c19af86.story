An 18-year-old man was arrested after allegedly threatening that a Connecticut town 'better be ready for the hail of bullets' because he had been bullied for so long.

The threat by University of Connecticut freshman Tyler McKenzie prompted the East Lyme school district to cancel sporting events and plan for additional security measures when classes resume Monday, police said.

McKenzie was arrested Wednesday and charged with first-degree threatening and second-degree breach of peace.

The arrest came about a week after the threatening comment was posted on YikYak, a social media website. 

State, local police and the FBI searched McKenzie's home in East Lyme and recovered evidence, authorities said.

Investigators say McKenzie admitted he wrote the threatening post. They say he acted alone, and they don't anticipate additional arrests. 

Police launched an investigation December 23 when they learned of a threat posted on the social media app Yik Yak.

The message stated: 'East Lyme better get ready for the hail of bullets. I’ve been bullied too long and, after break, I’m going to let all my anger out.’

On New Year's Eve, officers descended on Tyler McKenzie's home on Cubles Drive and executed a search warrant.

When officials questioned McKenzie about the threat, he reportedly admitted to making it but said he had no intention to carry an attack, according to WFSB.

Police said the 18-year-old did not have any guns registered to him and had no prior criminal record.

McKenzie has been released on $25,000 bond. The student has been banned from using social media and the Internet, and ordered to stay away from East Lyme schools.

Police records indicated that McKenzie was a victim of an assault while he was a student at East Lyme High School in March 2012, reported Fox CT. 

He has been placed under house arrest and must undergo mental health evaluations and stay on prescribed medications.

McKenzie will be allowed to return to UConn when classes resume January 20.
