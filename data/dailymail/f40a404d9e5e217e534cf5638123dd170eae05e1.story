Asked in an interview with Sportsmail before the World Cup to name his favourite English defenders, Radamel Falcao struggled initially, and then came up with the names of John Terry and Gary Cahill.

Remembering the hat-trick he scored against Cahill in the 2012 European Super Cup should send a shudder through the ranks of the Premier League's other defenders – if this is what he does against someone he rates, then what will he do to the rest?

Manchester United have acquired the services of the man Diego Simeone called the world's best No 9 when he coached him at Atletico Madrid.

His record in finals played in Europe sums up what a big-occasion player he is.

He got the winner for Porto against Braga in 2011's Europa League final and scored twice against Athletic Bilbao to retain the title. Then came that Chelsea demolition.

At best, United will only be playing one final (the FA Cup) this year but they have acquired the services of a man who has played in three since 2011, scoring six goals and always ending up on the winning side.

The son of Radamel Garcia, a rugged centre back who played most of his career in Venezuela, Falcao was named after Paulo Roberto Falcao, Brazil's No 15 in their 1982 World Cup dream team.

He soon showed himself to be worthy of the name with goals that earned him a move to River Plate aged just 15.

'He was like a rock,' said former Argentina defender Hernan Diaz, impressed at the unflustered nature of the new arrival he tried to intimidate on his first day.

Falcao was already showing a resilience of character that would serve him well in the 27-dorm block of youth team accommodation alongside River Plate's Estadio Monumental, where he boarded a long way from his family in Colombia.

In 2001, River's Under-16s went to Berlin to play in a 32-team tournament and he was all that anyone could talk about, shooting River into the semi-finals where he scored in the last minute against Real Madrid and then headed his team in front against Vitoria de Guimaraes in the final only to lose out 2-1.

Injuries slowed his progress and one torn ankle ligament kept him out for eight months. He kept the faith through the long period of inactivity and 'keeping the faith' in Falcao's case can be taken literally.

He can be seen dedicating goals and trophies to the heavens as a teenage prodigy. This is a player who has not ruled out working for the church when he retires.

The faith was tested again when he tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee in 2006 but again he showed that iron will to come back just as strong. He scored a hat-trick against Botafogo in the South American Cup in 2007 when his team were 2-1 down, playing with 10 men, and needing to win by two clear goals. The feat is still referred to as the 'Unforgettable Night' by fans who celebrated a title a year later with Falcao top scorer and Simeone as manager.

After 72 goals in two seasons at Porto he moved to Atletico Madrid where he linked up again with Simeone. The coach instructed his new players that tactics would revolve around Falcao – their passes would find him, and he would do the rest.

Two years older with another cruciate ligament injury, this time in the left knee, and a sabbatical in Monaco behind him, it remains to be seen whether Falcao is the same player that scored 52 goals in 67 games in La Liga.

The desire from the player is definitely there. 'I like how competitive the Premier League is and how teams who are very direct in terms of looking for the opposition's goal,' he said at the end of last season. 'I want to play in the English league.'
