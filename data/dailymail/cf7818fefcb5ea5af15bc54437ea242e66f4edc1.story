A mother and father have been found dead in an apparent murder suicide after their 20-year-old daughter discovered their bodies in their Layton, Utah home.

Bret Pepper, 39, is believed to have killed his wife, Jill Pepper, 37, while their other two children - aged 10 and 13 - were also in the house in Layton, Utah, US.

Police responded to a 911 call to 580 North Franklin Drive from the couple's oldest daughter at around 1.30am on Sunday morning.

She said she had gone to check on them after she heard fighting and loud bangs, and had found them both covered in blood and with gunshot wounds.

Curtis Salvensen from Layton Police Department said: 'During the course of the argument she heard several loud noises that she described as gunshots.

'At this time it doesn't appear that any of the other family members knew what was going on or witnessed the incident.'

Police said the couple had been fighting late into the night but that to those outside of the family, their lives looked anything but acrimonious.

Unexpected: Though it does not come as a shock that they had guns in the home but the family appeared to be close and spent time together frequently

Aspen posted photos of family trips to national parks, funny dress up sessions where she tried on her mother's old dance costume, and back yard barbeques where she is taking care of her younger siblings.

She is also seen shooting a gun under the watchful- but goofy- eye of her father who playfully put up 'bunny ears' while she smiled and held the handgun.

Other family members are now looking after the children, police said.

Family friend Jon Taylor told Fox 13 News: 'You would never suspect this of this house and this couple.

Home: The couple's three children were in the house for Christmas at the time

Heartbreaking: Friends and neighbours said they would never have expected this to happen

'You never heard of them fighting. They always spoke highly of each other. This is unbelievable.'

Salvensen said police hadn't been called to the home before, and investigators were trying to determine what led to the argument and subsequent deaths.

Salvensen said that stress around Christmas may have played a part, although this was not confirmed.

He said: 'Sometimes people let that stress build up.'
