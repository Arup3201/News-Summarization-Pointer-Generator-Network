A super-strict father prompted an outcry when he made his four-year-old son do press-ups in the snow wearing only his underpants and sail alone on the open ocean.

But now China's 'Eagle Dad' has gone even further.

He and his two children had to be rescued from the slopes of 12,000-foot (3,776-metre) Mount Fuji after embarking on a reckless climb.

Dangerous trip: He Liesheng and his son just had time to unfurl a banner that read, 'The Diaoyu Islands belong to China', before being helped down the mountain by park rangers

Unprepared: Mr Liesheng had only brought a chocolate bar and cup of water as rations, believing there would be shops on the mountainside

'Patriotic effort': He Yede, or Duoduo, was crying and nearly collapsing from altitude sickness by the time his determined father admitted defeat

He Liesheng, who lives in Nanjing in eastern China, flew his son Duoduo and 
older daughter Tiantian to Tokyo, Japan, for the trek.

He arrived at the mountain 
determined to reach the top, despite park rangers' warnings that climbing 
season was over.

Ignoring news of severe weather conditions and gale-force winds, Mr Lieshing hopped over the barrier and began his journey.

The pushy parent had brought only a chocolate bar and a cup of water for rations, thinking there would be shops en route.

He soon realised that, 'unlike a lot of Chinese mountains', Fuji does not have steps, according to Chinese media sources.

Test of endurance: Duoduo was forced to do press-ups in the New York snow wearing just his underpants

Merciless: The boy begged his father to hug him, but his parents insisted he get down on the floor before they gave him any help

He
admitted that he was as terrified as his children on some stretches of 
the climb, when the trio were forced to scale 70-degree slopes.

The
militant father had not brought waterproof clothing, so a sudden 
downpour soaked them to the skin, and most shelters on the mountain were
boarded up.

As temperatures dipped to almost zero
and the air became thinner, his children began crying and Duoduo, whose
real name is He Yede, was nearly collapsing with altitude sickness.

At 3,700 yards (3,400m) up, Mr Liesheng admitted defeat and the group were rescued by park rangers, who gave them warm clothes and medical treatment.

The family had just enough time to pose 
with a banner that read: 'The Diaoyu Islands belong to China' before 
beginning their descent with the help of the rangers.

Super-strict: He Lieshing insists that his extreme challenges will help his son Duoduo, who was born premature, to toughen up

In August, Mr Liesheng left his son to fend for himself on the open seas, to help him 'show his potential'

They were fed hot noodles to warm them up.

Eagle Dad has previously said that because his son was born several months premature he had to make him undergo tough tests of physical and mental endurance to build up his strength.

When the video of the unhappy child shivering in a snowy New York appeared on YouTube at the start of this year, outraged viewers demanded that Duoduo be taken into care.

His mother could also be heard in the footage, encouraging the boy to carry on as he begged for a hug.

By August, Mr Liesheng has his son following a strict training regime to enable him to compete against much older children in sailing competitions.

He said at the time: 'Only by placing him in a situation with strong winds and waves can he show his potential.'
