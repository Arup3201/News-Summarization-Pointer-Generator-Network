Gareth Bale believes more British players should play abroad at some stage in their career.

The 25-year-old winger left the comfort of the Barclays Premier League last summer when he joined Real Madrid from Tottenham for a world-record £85million transfer fee.

Bale's decision to swap the Premier League for La Liga was justified when he helped Real win the Champions League at the end of his first season in Spain.

Garteh Bale said he has loved life in Spain and feels it was important to challenge himself

Few British footballers ply their trade abroad but Bale insists that more should do so.

'I think the most important thing is you feel it's the right move,' he told The Independent ahead of Saturday evening's Madrid derby at the Bernabeu. 'If you feel you're going to play, then I would encourage a British player to go abroad.

'I've enjoyed every minute of it, the new culture, the new life. I felt like I wanted to challenge myself. It's down to the player himself whether he can kick on.'

Bale enjoyed a fine fine first campaign in Spain - he scored 22 goals in 44  appearances last term - but he is not about to rest on his laurels.

'I definitely feel I can keep improving every season, improve my game in training every day,' Bale said. 'We're expected to try to win every trophy. We want to win every trophy. We'll give our best.'

Bale, who scored both goals in Wales' 2-1 win in their opening Euro 2016 qualifier in Andorra on Tuesday, added: 'I feel like I'm improving all the time. I've learned a lot, in terms of possession and making the right decisions, when to attack and when to keep the ball.'
