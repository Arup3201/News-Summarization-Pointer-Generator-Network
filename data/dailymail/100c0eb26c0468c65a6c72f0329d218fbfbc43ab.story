Last August the National Football League — the world’s richest sports administrator — were forced to pay almost £500million to former American Football players suffering from early onset dementia caused by repeated head injuries.

Accused of decades of wilfully denying the long-term neurological damage caused by concussion, the NFL were hit in the only place that hurts: their pocket.

Few British sports fans took notice.

Taking notice: It's been a long time coming but British sports are finally taking concussion seriously

September, 2013 - Breaking news

Mail on Sunday runs the first piece on concussion entitled ‘Rugby’s ticking timebomb’ after evidence in United States links multiple head injuries to early onset dementia. The International Rugby Board and Rugby Football Union both deny there is enough evidence to make such a claim.

Former Wasps scrum half Nic Berry, forced to retire after multiple concussions, reveals his desperate fight to save his career and his wife’s fears for his future.

Sept 22, 2013 - Moody joins the fight

Former England captain Lewis Moody offers to donate his brain to medical research as the Mail on Sunday launches its concussion campaign.

November, 2013 - Football in dock

Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas is branded ‘irresponsible’ and ‘reckless’ for allowing goalkeeper Hugo Lloris to play on after being knocked unconscious.

The IRB admits ‘potential link’ between head injuries and early onset dementia. CEO Brett Gosper tells us there will be no cover up on concussion study research.

A week later, a coroner in Belfast found that Ben Robinson, a 14-year-old schoolboy rugby player with the world at his feet, died from Second Impact Syndrome after being allowed to carry on playing in a school’s cup game despite suffering obvious effects of concussion.

A few British sports fans took notice.

Six weeks later goalkeeper Hugo Lloris remained on the field at White Hart Lane after manager Andre Villas-Boas deemed the fact he had lost consciousness for almost a minute after his head collided with Romalu Lukaku’s knee was no reason to replace him.

Lloris did not play again for a month and Villas-Boas was derided. People were taking notice.

This week, RFU head of discipline Gerard McEvilly indicated to the Mail on Sunday that they will clamp down on any similar such meddling by coaches in this season’s Aviva Premiership. 

There is an appetite within rugby to introduce point deductions, or even fines for those breaching newly updated head injury protocols designed to protect players from themselves, or worse the meddling hand of coaches tempted to risk player’s long-term health for the sake of a league point. The sporting landscape has changed.

‘In just 12 months sports concussion has moved from an almost exclusively American sports issue to one that is now a major issue for global sport,’ said Professor Willie Stewart — a brain injury expert who advises the International Rugby Board.

Feb 28, 2014 - Campaign saluted

Mar 9, 3014 - Poor tests

England and British Lions prop Alex Corbisiero speaks out in the Mail on Sunday, describing current concussion protocols as ‘a joke’.

Mar 13, 2014 campaign success

The RFU and Premier Rugby announce sweeping new concussion measures, including agreeing to carry out independent research, compulsory concussion education for players, coaches and referees and the distribution of educational material to clubs and schools.

Mail on Sunday discovers 10-year study promised in the wake of former England striker Jeff Astle’s death from early on-set dementia in 2002 was never undertaken. 

Stewart, along with men such as Chris Nowinski at Boston University, where hundreds of brains have been examined and evidence of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in former footballers, rugby players and professional wrestlers has been found, are taking the conversation out of the hands of the mega-bucks sporting unions intent on sugar-coating reality in order to protect commercial interests.

Doctors employed by sports governing bodies with a vested interest in playing down the risk of concussion, are finally being challenged to back up with hard, reasoned evidence their claims that head injuries somehow resolve themselves. 

So far that evidence has not been forthcoming. Professor Paul McCrory, the lead author of the Zurich Consensus on Concussion in Sport, steadfastly refuses to speak with the media.

‘The most noticeable change since the start of the Mail on Sunday Concussion Campaign, has been the fact “The Elephant in the Room,” has escaped,’ said Ben Robinson’s father Peter, who has campaigned tirelessly since his son died needlessly in 2011.

‘Concussion is now in the public domain and no longer controlled by sporting bodies. Phrases such as “Concussion can be fatal” and “If in doubt sit them out” can be mentioned without feeling we have to produce a death certificate to justify it.’

August 10, 2014

Jeff Astle’s family meet FA chairman Greg Dyke, who apologises for their failure to deliver research and commits to fund future head injury study.

Sept 3, 2014

RFU say they are considering introducing a formal sanctioning process to prevent clubs flouting concussion protocols.

But while progress has been made, there is still much more to be done. Players still cheat concussion tests, research has still not been carried out, coaches still pressure doctors across professional sport. The relentless commercial imperative to deliver ‘success’ on the pitch routinely overrides concerns about players’ long-term health.

Last November the IRB’s chief executive Brett Gosper promised research into the effects of head injuries would be published. ‘There will be no cover up, we are not a cigarette company,’ said Gosper. Almost 10 months later, the research has still not been published.

Following Jeff Astle’s death in 2002, the FA promised his family they would conduct a 10-year study. Almost 12 years after that promise was made, no research has been published.

PFA chairman Gordon Taylor — reportedly earning more than £1m for a position at the top of the players union — has made no contact with the Astle family since a coroner found that Jeff died from ‘industrial disease’ caused by heading footballs.

‘Since the Mail on Sunday launched its concussion in sports campaign some sports have taken a few steps in the right direction,’ said Labour MP Chris Bryant, who wrote the report ‘Concussion can Kill’.

‘FIFA have said they will do some research. The FA have changed the rules for the professional game so that a medic — not the player, not the coach and definitely not the manager — should now make the decision on whether a player goes back on after a blow to the head. 

'Rugby has started making sensible noises too. But these are still faltering steps. We still don’t have a consistent message about concussion that applies across all sports.’

That message is that ‘concussion can kill’. The NFL denied that fact for decades and has ended up paying millions while a cohort of players have died suffering early onset dementia caused by head injuries which could have been avoided.

A year later, professional sport in Britain is taking notice. If it does not there will be more Ben Robinsons while the prediction of the FA’s head of medicine Ian Beasley of a ‘tsunami’ of compensation claims will come true. Sport has started to take notice. But is it too late?
