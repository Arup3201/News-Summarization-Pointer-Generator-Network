The remains of a woman who disappeared almost three years ago near Denver have been identified.

Amy Ahonen was last seen by her roommate on July 8, 2011, the day before her 38th birthday. Two days later, her black 2005 Jeep Liberty was found abandoned in Clear Creek Canyon near the side of U.S. 6 in Jefferson County.

Despite an extensive search of the area at the time, there has been no trace of the divorcee - until November when a bone linked to the victim was found.

Closure: The remains of Amy Ahonen who vanished nearly three years ago have been found

Vanished: Amy Ahonen was last seen by her roommate on July 8, 2011

Family and friends shared the news on Twitter and Facebook pages dedicated to finding her.

'Today is a sad day, as we are relieved 
to finally have some closure regarding Amy, however it is hard news to 
bear,' a note on the Find Amy Ahonen Facebook page, posted yesterday, said.

'Some
 remains that were found have been confirmed to be those of our beloved 
Amy. That is all the information we have at this time.'

The family also posted the news on Twitter: 'Sad news today. Remains found have been proven to be those of Amy. Please keep her, her family and friends in your thoughts.'

Confirmation: Ahonen's family and friends said the woman's remains were found

Hopeful: Despite an extensive search, Ahonen's family and friends never gave up hope of finding her

Denver Post reported that Jon Cline, an investigator with the Jefferson County Coroner's Office, said Wheat Ridge police gave a human bone found along Clear Creek near Marshall Street in November to the coroner's office.

The bone was then sent to Texas for a DNA test, where it was positively identified as a match to Ahonen, Cline said. He also said a bone fragment which was found was also linked to the missing woman. 

The Denver Police Department yesterday posted on its official Twitter feed that the case was not closed but added that no other information was available 'at this time'.

Search: Investigators searched the area, including a creek, but found no trace of the missing woman

According to Fox 31 Denver, Ahonen's disappearance has never been ruled a homicide. She reportedly moved to Colorado about five years before she vanished with her husband, who she later divorced.

On the night Ahonen disappeared, a passerby saw her Jeep on the side of the highway and called the Colorado State Patrol.

Denver
 Post reported that State Patrol officials indicated that Ahonen called 
911 asking for help with her vehicle, but when a trooper arrived, she 
said she didn't need help.

When
 the interior designer did not show up for work, authorities tracked 
down her Jeep. Her purse, wallet and car keys were still inside.

Investigators originally believed Ahonen may have fallen into the creek, but a search turned up nothing.

Family members also asked investigators to find the man who responded to a roommate ad the victim placed on Craigslist.

Amyâ€™s sister, Andrea Ahonen, said the man 'scared Amy' so much that she immediately took the ad down.

She also believed her sister did not mean to leave her car for long.

'It
 indicates to me she only meant to be away from that car for five 
minutes or less. We're from Detroit. We lock our doors,' she said.

Her family has not yet spoken to the media about the latest development.
