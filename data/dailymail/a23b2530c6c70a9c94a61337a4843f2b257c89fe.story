Jose Mourinho has declared his 'pride' at Chelsea's transfer business as he prepares to unveil Loic Remy as the 'perfect' addition to his attacking trio.

Remy could make his debut against Swansea on Saturday after a £10.5million move from Queens Park Rangers, which was completed once Fernando Torres had joined AC Milan on loan for the final two years of his contract.

The deal was the last step in Mourinho's overhaul of his strike options with Remy, Diego Costa and Didier Drogba replacing Torres, Demba Ba and Samuel Eto'o, who scored just 19 Barclays Premier League goals between them last season.

'Remy has just arrived and it is a new life for him,' said Mourinho. 'For Fernando, it would be the same life he'd had for previous years. His career here was not super successful but in important moments he was there many times and gave an important contribution to this club.

'We like him a lot but Remy was one of the players we had in our objectives. He was one of the players we were ready to try to get if a space opened. The club was ready to give us a striker we like and one perfect to be one of our three.'

The Chelsea boss has no fears about Remy despite reports that he failed a medical at Liverpool. This triggered concerns about a heart condition, first noticed when he joined Marseille from Nice in 2010.

'We don't have Liverpool's report,' said Mourinho. 'In this club, medical responsibilities start with Dr (Paco) Biosca. He did his job, not on his own, surrounded by opinions from top specialists in different areas, and the conclusion was the same as France's medical department had before the World Cup, that the player has no problem.' 

After criticising his strikers last season, the Chelsea manager is pleased with the balance up front.

'We have a guy in Didier who is a penalty-box expert, the best of the three in the air,' he said.

'Remy is fast, attacks spaces and can play from the sides. Diego is a player we were chasing for a year because he is a player for the style we want. We changed three for three and we believe these three give us more.'

Mourinho applauded his club for selling Ba, David Luiz and Romelu Lukaku to fund moves for Costa, Remy, Cesc Fabregas and Filipe Luis, when UEFA are scrutinising balance sheets for Financial Fair Play (FFP).

'We did our job in a good way, something that is fundamental for us,' he said. 'It's not just a legal question. It's also a pride question and that's FFP. It is something Mr Abramovich is proud of. My club did it in a magnificent way with the income and the players we bought.'

Costa, named on Friday as the Premier League's Player of the Month for August, is back in training after a hamstring injury picked up on international duty with Spain but may be given extra time to rest ahead of Wednesday's Champions League opener against Schalke.

Mourinho has not won the Manager of the Month award for nearly eight years but was happy to concede defeat to Garry Monk of Swansea, who will be at Stamford Bridge today.

'I prefer my players to be players of the month,' said the Chelsea boss. 'Last season some of them really deserved it and never got it and, this month, if it wasn't Diego or Fabregas or Matic, I would be more disappointed.

'Finally we have a player of the month, which Diego deserved. The fact the decision went to the Swansea manager for manager of the month is fair.'
