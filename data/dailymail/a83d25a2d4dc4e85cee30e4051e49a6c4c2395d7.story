Striking: Mary Jean Conniff at the Victor de Souza Fashion Show in 2012 at the Bowery Hotel in New York City

A rake-thin model was arrested for trying to steal boxes of fattening Pop-Tarts, a cake and cake mix from a Harlem supermarket.

Six-foot-tall Mary Jean Conniff appeared in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday charged with the May 5 theft where she agreed to a punishment of one day of community service.

Store workers at the Harelm Pathmark said that they felt sorry for the light-fingered model.

'I don’t want to judge her, but maybe she needed it,' said one employee. 'Maybe she was hungry and had a sweet tooth.'

The 
Detroit native previously appeared at the Fall 2012 Victor de Souza fashion show 
and was caught by a security guard stealing the sweet food, according to
 The New York Post.

'He
 observed the defendant  remove one cake, three boxes of Pop-Tarts, two 
boxes of cake mix and several other items from a shelf and conceal the 
items inside the defendant's purse and pockets,' said the cirminal 
complaint.

The
 store security allowed her to leave the Pathmark, after which she was 
grabbed and held until the police arrived to arrest her.

According to The New York Post, Conniff does not seem to have enjoyed much work since the show for Argentine designer De Souza.

He claims clients such as Lady Gaga, Sarah Jessica Parker, Naomi Campbell and Rihanna.

She refused to speak to reporters after her sentence and if she keeps her record clean will see her petit larceny charge reduced to a violation.

Her lawyer, Thomas Kenniff, said the whole arrest was a misunderstanding.

'There was no finding of guilt against my client. There’s no reason to think this was anything more than a misunderstanding. She will go on to live a law-abiding life as she has always done,' he said to The New York Post.
