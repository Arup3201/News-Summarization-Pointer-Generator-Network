A campaign aimed at destroying the Islamic State  in Syria and Iraq could outlast Barack Obama’s presidency, senior officials have warned.

It comes as it was revealed that a three-step strategy is being planned in a bid to overthrow the militants in a campaign that could last up to three years.

The first step is already underway and has involved dozens of airstrikes in the past month as part of moves to protect  U.S. personnel and ethnic minorities and halting ISIS progress in parts of western and northern Iraq.

According to the New York Times, the next phase in the campaign could involve renewed efforts to train up and equip Kurdish fighters and that could even mean training up members of Sunni tribes.

A final phase, which the newspaper suggests would be the 'most politically controversial', could involve tackling the terrorists in Syria in a campaign that Pentagon officials believe may last three years.

In an interview with CNN last week, Obama's deputy national security adviser, Tony Blinken said of the mission: ‘It’s going to take time, and it will probably go beyond even this administration to get to the point of defeat.'

The president is expected to officially unveil the United States’ plan for overthrowing the militants in an address to the nation on Wednesday. 

Obama told NBC in an interview that aired on Sunday morning that he would meet with lawmakers on Tuesday to give them the opportunity to scrutinize his plans before making a formal announcement the following day.

President Barack Obama said in an interview that aired Sunday on Meet the Press that he would unveil his strategy to defeat ISIS in an address on Wednesday

'We are going to be a part of an international coalition, carrying out air strikes in support of work on the ground by Iraqi troops, Kurdish troops,' he said in the interview.

'We are going to systematically degrade their capabilities. We're going to shrink the territory that they control. And ultimately we're going to defeat them.'

In previewing his strategy to Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, Obama acknowledged that there would be a military component to taking down the religious extremists and it would 'require some resources ... above what we are currently doing'.

But the Commander in Chief indicated this would not mean putting troops on the ground in Iraq or Syria.

'I'm preparing the country to make sure that we deal with a threat from ISIL,' he said.

'This is not going to be an announcement on about U. S. ground troops,' he said. 'This is not the equivalent of the Iraq war.'

'The notion that the United States should be putting boots on the ground would be a profound mistake,' Obama told Todd.

The U.S. does not have the resources to 'serially occupy various countries all around the Middle East,' he said. 

Obama ordered air strikes in northern Iraq last month as Kurdish-controlled territory fell to the Islamic State and the capital of Iraqi Kurdistan looked endangered.

Last weekend, U.S. warplanes carried out raids farther south in the province of Saluhuddin to break an Islamic State siege of the Shi'ite Turkmen town of Amerli.

Monday morning Reuters reported that U.S. warplanes had carried out five strikes on Islamic State insurgents around Iraq's Haditha Dam yesterday.

Obama has branded the Islamic State as an acute threat to the West and the Middle East and said that key NATO allies stood ready to back Washington in action against the well-armed sectarian force, which has seized expanses of northern Iraq and eastern Syria.

The strikes were Washington's first reported offensive into Anbar since it started attacks on Islamic State forces in the north of Iraq in August.
