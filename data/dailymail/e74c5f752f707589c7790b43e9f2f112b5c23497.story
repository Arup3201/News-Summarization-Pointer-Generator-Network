Cristiano Ronaldo has hailed Real Madrid team-mate Karim Benzema the top striker in La Liga after scoring twice in Sunday's 5-0 thrashing of Athletic Bilbao.

The Ballon d'Or holder praised Benzema's response after being booed by sections of his own supporters this season.

Ronaldo fired in another hat-trick for Real Madrid on Sunday, taking his tally for Los Blancos to 17 goals already this season, but the Portugal international highlighted the way in which Benzema managed to get the fans back on his side again.

'I'm happy for him,' Ronaldo told AS. 'He is the best striker in the league and one of the world's best.

'Criticisms are part of being a professional footballer and we have to be above such things.

The 5-0 rout over Athletic Bilbao was Madrid's sixth in a row in all competitions since their loss to city rivals Atletico last month but Ronaldo insists there is even more to come from Carlo Ancelotti's improving side.
