Tragedy: Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London's King Edward VII hospital

An inquiry has been launched by Australia’s media watchdog today into a radio station's prank call to the Duchess of Cambridge's hospital, which was followed by the apparent suicide of a nurse.

The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) will examine whether radio station 2Day FM and staff were in breach of
 broadcasting licence conditions.

The station risks being shut down if found to have broken the rules.

ACMA is also expected to ask 2Day FM’s parent company, Southern Cross Austereo, to name those responsible for approving broadcast of the hoax call.

ACMA's chairman, Mr Chris Chapman, said it would be examining ‘whether the licensee has complied with its broadcasting obligations.’

Miss Saldanha was found dead days after receiving a hoax phone call at London’s King Edward VII hospital from Sydney DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian.

She and another nurse in the ward where the Duches of Cambridge was being treated for morning sickness believed they were talking to the Queen and Prince Charles, despite the unimpressive attempts by the DJs to imitate the royals.

Although Austero has repeatedly apologised for the ‘tragic, 
regrettable death’ of the nurse and has committed at least $500,000 
(£326,000) to a memorial fund for her family, the media watchdog has 
shown its determination to dig deeper into the scandal.

The radio show's producers and lawyers on duty at the time of the hoax are expected to be questioned.

Apologetic: Following the death of nurse Saldanha, the two DJs Mel Greig and Michael Christian (pictured) appeared on 
Australian TV and expressed their sorrow for the tragic consequences of 
their hoax call

Following the death of nurse Saldanha, the two DJs appeared on Australian TV and expressed their sorrow for the tragic consequences of their hoax call.

The watchdog will be referring heavily to the radio broadcasting code, particular a part which states that it is a breach to record a person in conversation, and also air it, without their knowledge.

Section 6.1 of the code states that ‘a licensee must not broadcast the words of an identifiable person unless that person has been informed in advance or a reasonable person would be aware that the words may be broadcast.’

The section adds that there must not be a broadcast unless, ‘in the case of words which have been recorded without the knowledge of the person, that person has subsequently, but prior to the broadcast, expressed consent to the broadcast of the word.’

The station’s parent company has said it attempted to contact the hospital five times following the hoax call to discuss it, but had not been able to speak to anyone.

Mother-of-two Jacintha Saldanha, 46, was found hanged at her hospital apartment last Friday morning, just days after the hoax call and left a note for her family.

She
 had not told her husband or children that she was involved in the 
incident, meaning the letter may provide their only clue to what 
prompted the respected nurse to take such a drastic and tragic step.

Austereo has since pledged to donate $500,000 (£326,000) from its advertising profits to her family.

Condolences: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge sent their condolences to the Saldanha family following the death of nurse Saldanha who worked on the ward where the Duchess was being treated for morning sickness

Rhys Holleran,the company's chief executive officer said how sorry they were for what had happened.

'It is a terrible tragedy and our thoughts continue to be with the family.

'We
 hope that by contributing to a memorial fund we can help to provide the
 Saldanha family with the support they need at this very difficult time.

'The
 company reiterates that it is deeply saddened by this tragic and 
unforeseen event and offers its condolences to the family of Jacintha 
Saldanha.'

Austereo also cancelled the 2Day FM's 
Christmas party out of respect for Miss Saldanha, and donate the cash to
 two Australian charities that handle emotional, life threatening 
problems.

As much as £8,000 had been set aside 
to entertain between 200 and 250 of the radio station's staff, before 
executives decided the party would be inappropriate.

Before
 the nurse's death, Mr Christian said he expected the hoax would be the 
highlight of his career, and might have expected jubilant celebration at
 the end of year party.

Instead,
 a company spokesperson said: 'Cancellation of the party was 
entirely out of respect for the nurse, Jacintha Saldanha, and her 
family. This is not a time for celebration at the radio station.'

The
 party was due to be held at a trendy nightclub called the Oxford Art 
Factory on Sydney's popular nightlife strip, Oxford Street.

Lord
 Glenarthur, chairman of the hospital where Miss Saldanha worked, 
welcomed news of Southern Cross Media Group's donation to the family.

He said: 'Jacintha Saldanha was an outstanding nurse who was much loved by everyone at King Edward VII’s Hospital. 

'After
 discussion with her family, we have established the Jacintha Saldanha 
Memorial Fund to benefit her husband and children at this difficult 
time. I am pleased to announce that many donations have already been 
made from around the world. 

'I
 have read that Southern Cross Media Group have pledged to make a 
minimum donation of $500,000 Australian Dollars to an appropriate fund. 
We would certainly welcome such a donation.'

Meanwhile Family spokesman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, said Mrs 
Saldanha's family were demanding answers from the hospital about the 
circumstances that led to her death.

Although bosses at the hospital in 
Marylebone have said they will conduct internal inquiries, the nurse's 
family – husband Ben Barboza, 49, and children Junal, 17, and Lisha, 14 –
 'want to know everything'.

Mr Vaz, who has met hospital chairman 
Lord Glenarthur to demand a full inquiry, said: 'What the chairman of 
the hospital said to me was that there are inquiries going on in the 
hospital.

'That is not sufficient for the family. There are unexplained 
circumstances. The family want to know everything. All the facts, fully 
and clearly.'

Mr Vaz added: 'The hospital needs to 
be more pro-active, a full inquiry is needed and the family need to be 
included in that.

'They are a lovely close-knit family, a Catholic family
 who will be spending their first Christmas without their mother, and 
for Ben, without his wife.'
