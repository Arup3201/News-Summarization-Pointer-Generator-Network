Fernando Torres is ready to accept a loan move from Chelsea to AC Milan but midfielder Marco van Ginkel has opted to stay at Stamford Bridge.

Torres and the two clubs still need to come to an agreement over his wages. 

The 30-year-old has two years left on a Chelsea contract which is worth £9million-a-year to him but Milan’s offer stretches to £7m for what would be one year on loan in Serie A.

Jose Mourinho would love to offload Torres, who cost the club £50m in January 2012, and open space in his squad and recruit a different type of attacker but the board at Stamford Bridge are not prepared to pay the £2m shortfall. 

Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani confirmed his club was in talks over Torres on Tuesday.

He said: 'Our goal is to take a great striker. Fernando Torres? He is a great striker. Let’s see if he comes or someone else. We are actively working.'

Galliani was also confident of signing Van Ginkel but the Dutchman wants to remain in west London.

Chelsea are receptive to allowing the midfielder out on loan as he needs games following his cruciate ligament injury last year.
