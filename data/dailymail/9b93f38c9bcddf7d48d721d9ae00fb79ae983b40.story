This vast white landscape is covered in a blanket of stunning ice sculptures which are creations of nature.

The naturally formed ice blocks, named ice hummocks, have been created due to the extreme weather conditions.

Freezing temperatures and fierce winds causes fresh ice and ice floes to move, resulting in these picturesque blocks.

The ice hummocks, created through a combination of extreme winds and cold temperatures, can reach a height of 15m (50ft)

The ice hummocks can reach a height of 15m (50ft) and photographer Alexey Trofimov was awed by the amazing sights surrounding him.

The snapper took the photos at Lake Baikal in the south of the Russian region of Siberia, where temperatures can plummet to minus 38 degrees Celsius.

The lake itself is a natural wonder. It is at least 25 million years old and is known as one of the largest and deepest lakes in the world.

Lake Baikal also holds one-fifth of the world's fresh water.

Alexey, 42, who lives near Lake Baikal in Bratsk, said: 'Living so close to Lake Baikal it would be silly of me not to take the chance to photograph this beautiful and majestic place.

'There's still a lot of unexplored places in Lake Baikal and my job as a photographer is to show people the miracles of the nature here.

'On Lake Baikal everything is very stunning and unusual, the place does not cease to surprise.

'I am pleased with my photos but I want to go back and take some more interesting and unusual shots.

'I was happy I was able to pull off some amazing shots in this trip, and not only of the hummocks, but the beautiful landscapes too.'

'Miracle of nature': It is easy to see why photographer Alexey Trofimov described Lake Baikal as 'majestic'
