A Vietnam War veteran has received a Purple Heart 45 years after being injured in the war.

James R. Below's truck was blown up by a landmine and he saved the life of a fellow soldier, but his bravery has never been recognised until now.

Yesterday he was presented with the military decoration during a special afternoon ceremony in the Law Library of the Winfield K. Denton Federal Building, in Evansville, Southwestern Indiana.

Four decades: James R. Below, a Vietnam veteran has received a Purple Heart 45 years after being injured in the war

Award: Mr Below was presented with the military decoration during a special afternoon ceremony in the Law Library of the Winfield K. Denton Federal Building, in Evansville, Southwestern Indiana

'It means a lot,'  Mr Below said, but added  
'The real heroes are the ones that are engraved on the Vietnam wall ... 
the real heroes are our POWs.

'This is just a little bit of me trying to 
help my country for my fellow people. Your freedom is not free,' he told the Courier Press.

The terrifying event unfolded on  March 20, 1968 when Mr Below was transporting a truck of  artillery gun tubes between Pleiko and Da Nang in Vietnam.

The vehicle in front set off a delayed landmine and Mr Below and his co-driver were blown up as the truck careered off the road.

Recognition: 'It means a lot,' Mr Below said on receiving the award he¿s awaited over four decades for

Mr Below pulled his fellow soldier out from the burning truck.

Of course that was my main concern to get him out,' he said

But the pair were attacked by mortar and gunfire from the Viet Cong - his partner was hit by a bullet.

The partner was flown by helicopter to be treated for his injuries and Mr Below was taken to a nearby medic unit to be treated for burns to his arms

After treatment in Yokohama, Japan  he was transferred back to the States to Fort Knox, Ky., to finish the remainder of his enlistment.

He continued to serve as an Army Reservist until 1995.

Mr Below did not receive his medal because the paperwork was lost during moves around the country, but last year a co-worker spurred him on to getting the nearly four decades later.

Mr Below was also awarded the Vietnam
Service Medal, with three bronze stars, and the Republic of Vietnam 
Gallantry Unit Citation in front of his family.
