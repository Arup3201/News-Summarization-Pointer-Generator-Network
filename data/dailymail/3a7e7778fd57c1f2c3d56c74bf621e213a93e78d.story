A new weight loss balloon that can be swallowed in a capsule has been launched across the UK.

Unlike other gastric balloon treatments, Obalon does not require invasive surgery. Instead, in a 10-minute procedure, patients swallow a capsule the size of a large vitamin pill which contains a deflated balloon.

The capsule is attached to a hollow tube and, once the capsule arrives in the stomach, the balloon is inflated to the size of an apple. The capsule dissolves and the tube is removed via the mouth.

A new gastric balloon procedure has become available in the UK - it sees patients swallow a capsule (pictured) which contains a deflated balloon and which is attached to a tube. Once in the stomach, the tube is used to inflate the balloon. The tube is then removed and the capsule dissolves

The balloon sits at the top of the stomach, giving patients the sensation of fullness with the hope they then eat less and lose weight.

Patients receive a second balloon 30 days after the first procedure, with the option of a third balloon after around 60 days, based on their weight loss and feelings of fullness.

At the end of the treatment plan, a few months later, the balloons are deflated and removed during an outpatient procedure. 

Patients are not able to retain the balloons for more than 90 days but the hope is that the treatment will help them make lifestyle changes which they will then be able to maintain once the balloons have been removed.

Obalon costs from £2,995 for a two-balloon treatment. It is currently only available privately.

It is aimed at people who are not sufficiently overweight to qualify to weight loss surgery.

Clinical trials in the UK and in the U.S. have shown that patients lose an average of 1st 3lbs in 12 weeks.

One patient, Helene Fleckney, 43, from 
Shenley in Hertfordshire, said: ‘History of heart disease and diabetes 
runs in my family, so I knew I had to take action with my weight gain to
 lower my risk of susceptibility, as well as improving my confidence.

The balloon is about the size of an apple and sits at the top of the stomach to give a feeling of fullness

‘Obalon has proved an easy and quick treatment to help me lose weight. I'm not even fully through the treatment process yet and I've already lost a stone.

‘I'm looking forward to eating more healthily, doing more exercise and ensuring my weight loss struggles are a thing of the past.’

Sally Norton, a specialist keyhole surgeon for weight loss in the NHS and at Spire Hospital, Bristol, said: ‘I've been monitoring Obalon's progress over the last few years as I was very excited about the potential it could offer those patients who do not qualify for weight loss surgery but are struggling to lose weight and improve their health on their own.

‘It has minimal side effects, is quick and easy to place and is really well-tolerated.

‘It gives patients an initial weight-loss boost but also helps to change their eating behaviour - which is needed for long-term, weight-loss.’
