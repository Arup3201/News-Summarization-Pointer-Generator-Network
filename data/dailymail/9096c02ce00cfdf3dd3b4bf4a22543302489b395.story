England face Wales in the RBS Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Friday with Stuart Lancaster’s side seeking a championship title or Grand Slam as a precursor to their challenge at the World Cup.

Here, Sportsmail joins Test captain Chris Robshaw and World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson - who savoured European and global success with England - to discuss the week ahead and the events to follow…

CHRIS FOY: Does it feel like you’re being pitched straight in at the deep end in this Six Nations?

CHRIS ROBSHAW: Very much so. It was the same last year away to France. We fell five minutes short of an 80-minute performance which cost us the game and, potentially, a Grand Slam. Going to Wales, after what happened to us there in 2013 (losing 30-3), we have a core group of players who experienced that and I’m sure we’ll be more prepared this time.

FOY: There has been so much focus on that 2013 game - was that one of your worst days as a Test player and how determined are you to banish those ghosts?

ROBSHAW: It was. To have a loss like that, the biggest loss (by England) against Wales and that place in the history books is not a nice thing to have on your CV. We found ourselves chasing the game, the crowd were on top of us and they had all the momentum, so the floodgates opened. We want to rectify that and we’ll be ready for everything.

FOY: Jonny, did you find Cardiff one of the toughest places to go as an England player?

JONNY WILKINSON: It’s a hell of a place to go. In 2013, England knew Wales would come out firing, but they just couldn’t realise how much. It is impossible to be prepared for how much a community and a country can turn up the pressure. When you have thousands of people sitting together watching rugby, how can it be so different? But it is there. Wales in the Millennium Stadium manages to produce a unique atmosphere.

FOY: What makes the England-Wales rivalry so special and intense?

ROBSHAW: A lot comes down to how well they have done in recent years. They’ve won Grand Slams and we want those honours for ourselves. In 2013 we probably didn’t know quite what it meant, to go into the heartland of Wales to try to win a Grand Slam. Stuart spoke to us about going into the eye of a storm and that’s what it was. That passion we experienced has really built that rivalry among us players.

WILKINSON: What comes to the fore when England play Wales is that they will do anything to defend the pride and honour of their country. That makes it a really physical battle but Wales also have some of that ‘French flair’, too. When we played them in the quarter-final of the World Cup in 2003, I’d never been attacked like that before. They just went for it, and that is what Wales can do to you.

FOY: How relevant is this game to the World Cup pool match later in the year?

35 - Jonny Wilkinson holds the Six Nations record for most points scored in a game. The former England fly-half scored 35 in an 80-23 win over Italy in 2003.

WILKINSON: You could play this game then play each other again the week after and the result could be very different. When you think like that, eight months is a long time so whoever wins this game won’t necessarily win the next. But it is a huge opportunity to become familiar with the intensity that will be required.

ROBSHAW: There is a lot riding on this game, with everything coming up, but eight months is a long time to keep developing - and we will be playing that World Cup game at Twickenham, which is important. I know they kindly offered to stage it in Cardiff but I’m glad it’s going to be here! This trip to the Millennium Stadium will produce a similar amount of pressure as we’ll have to deal with at the World Cup, so this will be useful mental preparation.

FOY: How crucial is it for England to win the Six Nations title or Grand Slam to create momentum?

ROBSHAW: After three second-place finishes of course we want to go one better this time, but a lot of the northern-hemisphere teams went well in the autumn and we all want to finish top of the pile in Europe, to give us that extra confidence going into the World Cup.

WILKINSON: During my career, there were definitely moments when we cleared major psychological barriers. Beating Australia in 2000 - when we won in the last minute - was one and the Grand Slam in 2003 was another. Even if we hadn’t won it, I still think we were on the right track for the World Cup that year. You want to clear those psychological barriers, but England beat New Zealand in 2012 by a hell of a score and nobody thought, “That’s it, we’ve cracked it”.

FOY: A home World Cup will put huge pressure on the England captain. How will you cope with that, Chris?

ROBSHAW: The good thing about it being a home World Cup is that, when you have the occasional day off, you can go home, see loved ones and escape the rugby bubble. We’re not quite sure about the magnitude of it yet, but escaping the pressure is all about surrounding yourself with the right people and switching off when you can. You have to be focused on the job, but it is important from that mental side to have a down day now and again.

FOY: Jonny, how do you assess the progress Chris has made as a player and as England captain?

WILKINSON: When I first came into the England squad, I felt like a rabbit in the headlights but Chris seemed to fit in straightaway. He is full of respect and good values, but when he’s out on the field you give him a job and he does it right every time.

He just gets on with things without making a big song and dance. He has grown and grown, and shown his strength of character so many times.

What you want your captain to do is make good choices, do the right things and lead by example. Chris does all that and he’s a nice bloke, so playing against him must be so difficult. He has respect and his players will see that, which means that they will follow him.

FOY: George Ford has emerged as England’s first-choice fly-half, and Owen Farrell is injured. Jonny, how do you rate the young playmaker who will wear No 10 and the other, who will be missed?

WILKINSON: George Ford is a fabulous player who produces some amazing touches and is a natural in the way he reads the game. He works hard and as a young guy he is happy to take on responsibility and shows he can deal with it.

Owen Farrell is immensely tough mentally and deserves a hell of a lot more credit than he has been getting for what he has done in the last few years.

As a young guy, he has dealt with pressure, kicked goals and stood up in defence. He came in without much experience but just got on with it. England are lucky to have both those guys.

FOY: Chris, which teams are the main threats to your title ambitions in this Six Nations?

ROBSHAW: I don’t think we can look much further than that first game in Wales, but Scotland are also playing well and Ireland were probably the form team coming out of the autumn.

There won’t be any easy games - that’s why it’s a great tournament.
