Former Leeds United managing director David Haigh has filed a counter claim against the club's former owners GFH Capital.

Lawyers acting for Haigh, who has been held in a Dubai jail for five months without trial, have filed a breach of contract against GFHC and Hisham Alrayes, managing director of GFHC and a former Leeds director and CEO of GFH.

The claim, which has been filed in Dubai International Finance Centre (DIFC), alleges that bonus shares due to Haigh from his former employers GFHC were paid at an undervalue.

It also alleges that other parcels of shares agreed between GFHC and Haigh as part of his remuneration while working as the bank's deputy CEO were never paid.

GFHC are claiming £4million from Haigh, alleging he falsified invoices, and have had his assets frozen worldwide.

This claim has been denied by Haigh. In a statement, Haigh said: 'The DIFC claim lodged by my lawyers represents only a tiny fraction of the amounts I shall be claiming from GFHC, who I believe have misused the Dubai legal system to have me incarcerated. They have resisted all attempts by my team to reach out to them through their senior executive officer Jinesh Patel.

'The conditions of my detention have made it impossible to prepare a speedy defence or counter claims to their allegations against me.

'However, my legal team has now almost completed my defence and is now proceeding with my counter claims. I am confident that the defence they will shortly issue on my behalf will completely exonerate me while raising serious questions about my incarceration.'

Stuart Leasor, of Woodstock Leasor Ltd, acting on behalf of GFH, countered: 'It is clear from David Haigh's statement issued today that this is just another desperate attempt to showboat. Whilst GFH Capital maintains its claims of fraud against Mr Haigh in the DIFC Court, Mr Haigh files claims of no substance and negligible value purely to attract media attention. He claims to have no funds and little access to the outside world and yet he seems to be able to bombard the media at will.'
