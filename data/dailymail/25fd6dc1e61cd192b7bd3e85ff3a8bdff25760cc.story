David Moyes has confirmed that Manchester United have made a second bid for Cesc Fabregas and has warned that he is not ready to give up on his pursuit of the Barcelona star.

United manager Moyes said at a press conference at Yokohama’s Nissan Stadium today that chief executive Ed Woodward is still in touch with the Spanish club about Fabregas after submitting a second bid thought to be in excess of £30million, which would be a new club record.

He said: 'My understanding is that Ed's had a response and he's spoken with them [Barcelona] and again we've made a second offer. But Ed's dealing with that, rather than me personally here.'

Manchester United could be forced to break their record transfer fee if they are to lure Cesc Fabregas to Old Trafford. Here's the list of 10 previous records at the club.

Dimitar Berbatov - £30.75m from Fulham, September 2008

Rio Ferdinand - £29.3m from Leeds, July 2002

Juan Sebastian Veron - £28.1m from Lazio, July 2001

Ruud van Nistelrooy - £19m from PSV, June 2001

Dwight Yorke - £12.6m from Aston Villa, August 1998

Jaap Stam - £10.75m from PSV, July 1998

Andy Cole - £7m from Newcastle, January 1995

Roy Keane - £3.75m from Nottingham Forest, July 1993

Gary Pallister - £2.3m from Middlesbrough, August 1989

Mark Hughes - £1.8m from Barcelona, June 1998

Asked if there comes a point when 
United will move on to other targets, Moyes admitted there was but said 
that point hadn’t come yet.

'I think a point does come [when you 
give up on a transfer target] but I think when you are interested in 
good players you want to give it every opportunity to materialise.

'And I'll do that. I'll hope that things can continue to try to move forward.

'At this moment in time I can only 
tell you that Ed Woodward is working hard to make the deals happen and 
we're hoping some of them will fall into place shortly.'

He also added that he could understand the 
anxiety of United fans still waiting for the first big transfer of the 
Moyes era. So far, United have not made any new signings this summer other than Uruguay Under 20 defender Guillermo Varela.

'I can understand that [anxiety], but
there isn't any real update I can give you. But I can understand why 
that might be the feeling.

'But I think everybody had thought 
this might be the summer - with there being quite a few changes - my new
position, other managers at other clubs, and it might be that the 
transfers are later in the month, and I think that was always the 
thought I had when I came into the job.

'And you've got to remember I only 
started the job on July 1 as well, so in truth I've only been in this 
job for three weeks at this moment in time.'

The United squad has been joined in 
Tokyo – the third leg of their tour – by Japan forward Shinji Kagawa and by English duo Ashley Young and Chris Smalling, who have been
injured.

Neither play will figure in United’s game here on Tuesday night but Moyes said: 'They will figure later in the tour.'
