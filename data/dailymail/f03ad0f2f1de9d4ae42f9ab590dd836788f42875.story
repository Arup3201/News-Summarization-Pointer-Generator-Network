A mother-of-three who survived breast cancer has had to have all of her toes amputated after developing a ‘preventable’ infection following reconstructive surgery.

Leanne Parker, 41, is also facing the possibility that her legs might now have to be amputated below the knees.

The community support worker from High Peaks, Derbyshire, would not have developed the infection had she been given the antibiotics she should have had after surgery.

Ms Parker was diagnosed with breast cancer when she was 37.

She went on a healthy-eating diet and lost two bra sizes as a result of which she was able to feel the lump in her breast.

She visited her GP who quickly referred her to hospital where the cancer was diagnosed.

She told ITV’s This Morning: ‘It [was] a surreal moment. It’s one of those that… it’s almost like it will never happen to you.

‘You just can’t start to begin…where do you go from there?

‘There are so many questions, so many feelings, emotions running through you. You don’t know where to begin.’

Ms Parker developed organ failure and nearly died after the operation. As her body fought for life, her blood was channeled towards her vital organs so her extremities were deprived of oxygen meaning they died

Ms Parker, who has a 22-year-old son and two teenage daugthers, had a single mastectomy and four months of chemotherapy.

During her treatment, she learned that her grandmother had died of ovarian cancer – until that point Ms Parker believed she had died of colon cancer.

This raised alarm bells with Ms Parker who feared that this family history meant that she was more likely to see her cancer return in the future.

Therefore, she decided to have her other breast, her ovaries and her fallopian tubes removed as well.

Once she had recovered from these operations, she started to think about reconstructive breast surgery.

Ms Parker says that without her toes she struggles to balance and that she often falls over. She says that it has changed the way she walks meaning that her knees, hips and back are being damaged as well

In February 2011 she was admitted to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester where she had surgery to reconstruct her breasts.

When she woke after the surgery, she was horrified to discover that the surgery had not gone as she expected.

She told This Morning: ‘The first thing you do is to have a look as this is the final stage. This is the end of the road.

‘You have gone through everything and this is the final bit to become normal again, as such.

‘When I looked down I realised that everything was wrong, it was misshaped.

‘It just didn’t look right in any way. I just couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was horrible.’

She added: ‘I was devastated. I can’t tell you – it was heart-breaking. It really was.

‘I
had stayed so strong and positive all the way through. I was really 
trying to keep as strong as possible to prove to my daughters that there
is no fear – because, obviously, their future is now in question as 
well [because of the family history of cancer].’

She told This Morning: 'It's very difficult. Your balance is always affected. You are never stable, never ever stable. There are many times you just go down'

This was far from the end of Ms Parker’s suffering.

The week after her surgery, she became so ill and delirious that she lost control of all of her bodily functions.

Her friends were so concerned that they called an ambulance and she was rushed to hospital.

Here, it was discovered that she had developed an infection that was causing her organs to fail.

She was put in a medically induced coma and given life-saving drugs.

However, the drugs caused more 
complications – Ms Parker explained that because her body was fighting 
to survive, her blood was all being channelled into her brain and torso 
meaning that her fingers and toes were deprived of oxygen.

As a result, they started to turn black.

Ms Parker said: ‘I had never seen anything like it. I was devastated.’

She was told to go home and that the toes would die and fall of naturally.

Ms Parker had one of her breasts removed during her cancer treatment. She then discovered that she had a family history of cancer so decided to have her other breast and her reproductive organs removed as well

However, she developed gangrene and had to return to hospital to have her toes amputated.

She told This Morning: ‘It’s very difficult. Your balance is always affected. You are never stable, never ever stable. There are many times you just go down.

‘The foot also suffers with lots of problems, the knees suffer, the hips suffer, the back suffers.

‘It just goes on and on. The foot starts to collapse slowly. Then you face more amputations.

‘The question is where they have to amputate next. They are questioning having to amputate just below the knee now.’

She added: ‘You’ve got to keep going, if you don’t keep going then you are going to just sit down. It’s a sink or swim question. If you don’t, what will the children do without you?’

Ms Parker’s solicitor, Iona Meeres-Young from Slater and Gordon, said: ‘This is a very straightforward error that could have been prevented.

‘The reason Leanne is faced with the difficulties she now has is because the hospital failed to prescribe antibiotics after the surgery.’

She added: ‘All of the consequences that Leanne is now faced with would have been prevented.’

She went on to explain that Ms Parker should have been given antibiotics after the reconstructive surgery to prevent infection but that the hospital trust has admitted that the doctor failed to prescribe them.

Ms Parker is now agreeing a settlement with University Hospital of South Manchester NHS Foundation Trust.

A spokesperson for the trust said: 'We are very sorry that Ms Parker didn’t receive the level of care she expected at our hospital in February 2011.

'Following an investigation, we identified that our processes fell below the standards we would expect and we could have done more.

'We wrote a letter of apology to Mrs Parker on 28 October 2011, and this case is now with our legal department to agree a settlement.

'This was an extremely rare case, and we have reviewed and improved our processes around patient communication and discharge protocol as a direct result of the investigation into Ms Parker's care.'
