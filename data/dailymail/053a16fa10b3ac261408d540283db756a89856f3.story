An experiment in tapping into the student psyche through one of the most popular television series of the moment has has worked spectacularly for staff in at University of Sydney.

Student marketing and communications team manager David Als and his staff had a timely idea to provide students with some light relief during the exam period, which also coincided with the final episode of this season's Game of Thrones episode on Monday night. 

'The video is a simple and fun way to show that we have similar interests to students,' Mr Als told Daily Mail Australia. 'We've created a bit of light relief and acknowledged that even though exams are looming, we are all here for the same thing - to grow, learn and in the students' case, to graduate.'

Winter comes to Sydney University: Staff recreated the Game of Thrones opening to given students some light relief before their exams

Popular culture: Student marketing and communications team manager David Als said the video had tapped into the student psyche and spoke to them in a language they converse in. Pictured are characters Tyrion Lannister, left and Joffrey Baratheon

The university’s organist and carillonist Amy Johansen plays the theme song to rolling Game of Throne-style text in the video.

'Winter is coming. Winter is here. Semester gathers, and now my studies begin. I am the watcher on the Wentworth Building, I am the keeper of the quad,' it reads.

'For exams are dark and full of terrors, I pledge my mind and slumber to graduation, for this semester and all semesters to come.'

The video was shot about three to four weeks ago using a drone to show off the university's sandstone towers and buildings, quadrangles and lawns and aerial shots of the areas surrounding the campus, including Newtown. Also featured in the video is Ms Johansen playing the theme song.

The video took about 10 hours to put together including some special effects

The release of the viral video coincided with the season finale of Game of Thrones

Mr Als said the university has already played the show's theme song from its bell towers. 'We've put more work in this time, to make this more relevant,' he said.

With his team looking after student relations internally and marketing for prospective students, Mr Als said the video was put together in less than 10 hours, including special effects to give it a winter feel.

But with it quickly going viral, Mr Als said he and his team were 'astonished' at the reaction and he considered it a 'great return on investment.'

The drone was able to capture the university's sandstone towers, depicted in a style similar to that of the smash series' opening

'We posted it on Monday at 10.30am and in 24 hours it had nearly 25,000 hits. The Facebook post had more than 300 likes, 65 shares and 45 comments.'

'We were keen to experiment with news jacking and monitoring it while communicating and talking about the university, he said. 'It's about understanding the current psyche and talking in a language that they wish to converse.'

'Great return on investment': After 24 hours, the video had been watched close to 25,000 times

The video was also a way to show students that the university staff shared similar interests

'We talked about it going viral beforehand, but within an hour it went wild - it just goes to show about tapping into popular culture.'

Mr Als said the video was an ideal medium, which could be used across social channels to engage with the student community. 'We knew Game of Thrones was something the students were interested in,' he said.

The drone also captured sweeping aerial shots of Sydney CBD and Newtown

Mr Als said the project was also a chance share a message about growing, learning and graduating
