McDonald's is testing custom-made burgers with a choice of 20 toppings and sauces.

Customers at the two U.S. restaurants involved in the pilot are able to have their burgers grilled to order through.

They make their order on iPads in the two pilot stores at Laguna Niguel, California, and Romeoville, Illinois.

Business insiders are watching the 
pilot scheme with interest as the custom-made burgers are a departure 
from McDonald's signature fast-food.

Richard Adams, who runs a consulting firm for McDonald's franchisees, said that speed is the bigger issue for the chain.

'They're
 not going to do that with a lot of customization,' he said. 'Their 
growth potential has to be built on speed, not customization.'

Darren
 Tristano, executive vice president at food industry consultancy 
Technomic, told told the Orange County Register that the move is trying 
to appeal to customers who want 'better bugers with quality ingredients'
 when dining out.

The burgers cost $5.79 - more than a Big Mac - and one with bacon is $1 more.

Business experts say the speed of delivering the food is key to McDonald's growth

McDonad's is competing with chains like Chipolte and Five Guys that offer customers more flexibility in their orders

Among
 the various toppings and sauces on offer are chedder cheese, guacamole,
 caramelized onions, grilled mushrooms and garlic sauce.

The burger itself is the same as those used in a Quarter Pounder but are cooked to order.

McDonald's said in a statement: 'With 
these tests, we will have an opportunity to hear directly from our 
customers in real-time on what they expect from McDonald’s in terms of 
the overall restaurant experience and their ability to further customize
 their menu choices.'

The 
world's biggest hamburger chain is trying to compete with more chains 
like Chipolte and Five Guys that offer customers more flexibility in 
their orders.

Its new Dollar Menu and More also features five sandwiches with different sauces and toppings.

Kevin
 Newell, chief brand and strategy officer for the U.S told the company's
 presentation for investors: 'Customization represents another important
 opportunity for our business.

He said the chain is equipping its kitchens with new 'assembly tables' that can accommodate more ingredients.

He
 said the tables will also help improve the speed of service, which has 
become an issue for McDonald's as it has expanded its menu.

The
 remarks came as McDonald's Corp., which has more than 14,000 U.S. 
locations, struggles to boost sales amid heightened competition and 
shifting eating habits.
