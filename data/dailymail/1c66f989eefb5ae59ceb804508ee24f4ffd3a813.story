A schoolgirl has drowned and her boyfriend is missing after the pair went for a  late-night swim following a music festival.

The body of Hayley Holmes, 17, was found washed up on a beach early on Monday morning.

She had spent the previous day at Mathew Street festival in Liverpool with her 21-year-old boyfriend Robbie Crofts, who has not been seen since Sunday night.

Police yesterday revealed they had 
found a pair of girl’s sandals near where Hayley’s body was discovered, 
along with a pair of trainers thought to belong to Mr Crofts.

The search for him continued 
yesterday amid fears that both had come to grief in the choppy waters of
the   Mersey. Meanwhile, Hayley’s devastated friends and relatives 
posted tributes to her on Facebook, while her headmistress praised her 
enthusiasm and ‘zest for life’.

The couple travelled from the Wirral 
to spend Sunday in Liverpool before returning to Mr Crofts’ parents’ 
home in New Brighton and apparently heading for the promenade at about 
8pm.

Hayley’s body was found at 7am the following day by a dog walker, along with the sandals and a pair of Converse trainers.

Yesterday police confirmed they were 
also searching for her boyfriend as a friend said his family were 
‘beside themselves with worry’.

Detective Inspector Rachel Wilson, of
Merseyside Police, said: ‘We are growing increasingly concerned for 
Robbie’s well-being and would appeal for anyone who has seen him to 
urgently get in touch.

‘We now know that Robbie and Hayley 
were together on Sunday night and had spent the day at the Mathew Street
music festival in Liverpool before returning to Robbie’s home in New 
Brighton for a short while. They were not seen by friends or family 
after around 8pm.’

Hayley’s death is officially being 
treated as ‘unexplained’, but a postmortem examination has established  
that she drowned and there are no suspicious circumstances.

Hayley was a sixth form student at 
Upton Hall RC Convent Grammar School. Headmistress Patricia Young said: 
‘Hayley was a bright, beautiful girl with a bubbly personality and so 
much potential to fulfil.

‘Hayley was also a former member of the school council, with a real zest for life and a desire to look after others.

‘She should have been returning to 
school next week to start her final year at Upton and begin applying to 
university. She was looking forward to all the special events planned 
for the year ahead.

‘Her friends and teachers are deeply shocked and our hearts go out to her family who are so very proud of her.’

Nearly 10,000 mourners have joined a 
Facebook tribute page in memory of Hayley. Her younger sister Keeley 
wrote: ‘Seventeen is so young you still had the rest of your life ahead 
of you. Couldn’t have asked for a better sister. I love you millions and
more my princess.’
