He was in the process of moving to Tenerife to live with Miss Middleton, who emigrated to Arona several years ago to run a restaurant.

She moved there with her children, aged 12, five and three, after her mother Elaine Fraser and stepfather relocated to Santa Cruz. 

Miss Middleton’s friend Debbie Murray, who also lives on the island, said locals were shocked and saddened by her death. 

She is still waiting to find out details of the crash and has only heard that Miss Middleton had been driving. Miss Murray, from Belfast, said: ‘She was one of my daughter’s best friends. 

'We were back home when we got the news at the weekend; it was really upsetting. I’m shocked because Lauren knew the roads very well over here. 

'She was the life and soul of the party, she always made everyone laugh. She was always happy and nothing ever brought her down. She was an amazing mother and just lived for her three kids.’

Miss Middleton is believed to have been dating Mr Digby for about a year. He travelled to Tenerife to be with her when he was not working offshore.

Miss Murray said: ‘I got to meet Graeme when they first got together. He is a lovely guy. They were so well-suited. It was the first time I had seen Lauren happy in a while. She was so bubbly and over the moon about her relationship with him.

‘In the long term they were looking to be together here. It was her world because her mum was here and the kids were settled in nursery. It was quite a shock for us to get the phone call about it.’

She added that her friend had been a sociable person who enjoyed going to the gym, saying: ‘She was so energetic and always loved being on the go, meeting up with all her friends and catching up for lunch.’

Yesterday, a relative who lives with Mr Digby in Aberdeen said his father had flown to Tenerife to be with him. She added that the family were devastated over Miss Middleton’s death, saying: ‘She was a lovely girl. We will all miss her.’

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We can confirm the death of a British national on February 28 in Tenerife. We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.’
