It may be perfect for carting the kids around or moving house but women are decidedly unimpressed by an estate car.

New research reveals that estate cars are the least likely type of vehicle to make a lasting impression.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, a third of drivers would opt for a prestige car to make a great first impression, but just one per cent would go for an estate.

Want to impress on your first date? Ditch the estate! Women are turned off by the practicality of the car

Women in particular are put off by the practicality of an estate car, while a Mercedes topped the list for the car to make the best impression with 32 per cent of the vote.

The street-appeal of sports cars and coupes also made them a top choice to impress for more than one in five motorists.

According to the new research, younger motorists are particularly fussy when it comes to driving the right car.

Almost a quarter (23 per cent) of 25-34 year olds said the car someone drives is important when meeting a potential partner.

Reassuringly though, it's not all about the wheels. Almost half (49 per cent) of all respondents admitted that the first thing they usually notice about someone on a first date is their smile.

'Although we make judgements about people every day, this is magnified on a first date' said a spokesperson for Europcar UK Group, who commissioned the research.

'But our research suggests that a winning smile and a prestige car with wow factor could make sure there's a good chance of a second date.'

When it comes to making a lasting impression, more than one in four women prefer the space and celebrity appeal of a limousine, while a quarter of men opt for the thrill of a sports car.

Making a good impression: Almost a quarter of 25-34 year olds said the car someone drives is important when meeting a potential partner

Regionally, it is drivers in the north-east who believe the car someone drives is important to make a good impression on a potential partner at 44 per cent, compared to just 16 per cent of motorists living in the east of the UK.

Londoners (35 per cent), those from the north west (34 per cent) and the south east (32 per cent) also thought the set of wheels was important for making a good first impression.
