A hardline Sydney Islamic preacher has launched an inflammatory Facebook tirade, saying Muslims who preach acceptance 'will never be Australian enough' for 'bigots'.

In a post to supporters Sheikh Abu Adnan, from Sydney's western suburbs, wrote: 'This is an advice to those Muslims who are trying very hard to send out the message of acceptance.

'"I am an Australian too!" is what they a screaming out in their responses to many Facebook articles,' he goes on in the rant.

'Realise that these comments will go unnoticed because to the bigoted Australian, you are not white, not blue eyed and don't carry a white name like John.'

Sheik Abu Adnan is considered to be a prominent lecturer in the Islamic community in Sydney.

The Sheikh continued: 'Don't forget, and if you weren't born yet, ask your migrant parents, that these are the same people who hated their Asian neighbours because they have different eyes and read top-down.

'Their fathers had issues with Greeks and Italians when they immigrated into Australia and invented the derogatory term WOGs for them.'

'Their grandfathers had problems with the Irish-Catholics and their great-grandfathers believed that black people are under-developed sub-humans, who deserved to be killed and their land raped from them.'

'You will never be Australian enough to them.'

'To this bigot, your wife who wears the hjiab is oppressed'.

The Sheikh did not respond to a Daily Mail Australia query about these remarks, but in Facebook comments which followed he said they were not aimed at all Australians, just bigoted community members.

'Obviously there are many who are good, the post aiming on bigots who don't get it,' he wrote.

'I know many Aussies who are not racist'.

But leading Muslim activist Dr Jamal Rifi blasted the post and said it sent the wrong message.

'(Australian Muslims) have the right to feel the right to feel as Australian as anyone else.' he said.

'They shouldn’t feel anything less, regardless of where they are born, regardless of their faith regardless of how funny their name sounds.'

In the post, Sheikh Adnan also labelled unnamed Muslim activists who criticised their own community to win white votes 'house Negros'.

The Sheikh told Daily Mail Australia those comments were not about anyone in particular.

He emailed: 'The comments are general advise, NOT made to this incident in particular or any event in particular nor about any individual in the community.'

Dr Rifi fired back, saying that the real people who are demonising the Islamic community are the likes of Australian militants Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar, who are fighting in the MIddle East.

'I reckon the one who is demonising our community is the Australians fighting overseas and parading severed heads on Facebook. These are the culprit.

'And... everyone else should point the finger at these people overseas who are demonising not just our community, their own family, and their own religion. And that’s why (the Sheikh) is wrong.'

A Twitter account purporting to belong to Khaled Sharrouf posted this horrific image of his son wielding the head of a dead fighter.

Dr Rifi said the Sheikh should take a stand to enlighten and inform his supporters.

'The way we should lead is not to follow the masses but taking a stand that enlightens and informs the masses,' he said.

Last week Sheikh Abu Adnan was one of more than 60 Islamic community members and groups who signed a letter opposing Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s proposed counter-terrorism laws.

The legislation has divided the local Islamic community with some members refusing to meet with the Mr Abbott over the laws.

‘These laws clearly target Muslims and they do so unjustly,’ the petition said.

‘While the language of the law is neutral, it is no secret that in practice these laws specifically target Muslims’.

The debate over the proposed laws continues.

'This is an advice to those Muslims who are trying very hard to send out the message of acceptance. "I am an Australian too!" is what they a screaming out in their responses to many Facebook articles. Realise that these comments will go unnoticed because to the bigoted Australian, you are not white, not blue eyed and don't carry a white name like "John". To this bigot, your wife who wears the hijab is oppressed, You are brown and follow a religion that originated from the far away deserts of the Middle East.''Don't forget, and if you weren't born yet, ask your migrant parents, that these are the same people who hated their Asian neighbours because they have different eyes and read top-down. Their fathers had issues with Greeks and Italians when they immigrated into Australia and invented the derogatory term WOGs for them. Their grandfathers had problems with the Irish-Catholics and their great-grandfathers believed that black people are under-developed sub-humans, who deserved to be killed and their land raped from them. You will never be Australian enough to them.''This is a sincere reminder to some of the Muslim politicians who like to continually demonise their own community thinking that they will win the hearts and minds of these white voters. Stop dancing and embarrassing yourselves, stop being a "house negro"!'
