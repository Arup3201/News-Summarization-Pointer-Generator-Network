Yo-yo dieting mother-of-four Alison Batchelor had tried everything to lose weight, even having her jaw wired shut.

But every slimming technique she used always resulted in her piling back on any weight she had actually lost - in that case, just 3lbs - immediately after.

So now, having lost and regained a total of 70 stone over 45 years, Alison, 62, from Wadebridge in Cornwall, has taken drastic measures and had a gastric band fitted - selling her brand new £10,500 car to pay for the irreversible surgery.

Alison Batchelor - pictured left, now at her 10 stone goal weight, and right, aged 54 and 16 stone - sold her car to pay for gastric band surgery after yo yo dieting for 45 years

Alison now weighs 10 stone, is a size 10/12, and is finally happy with her weight after having had gastric band surgery

The drastic step paid off and she dropped six stone (and kept it off) after her stomach was reduced to the size of a walnut.

Alison, 62, said: 'I tried every diet going and I'd lose the weight but I would just pile it all back on again - and some more. I spent a fortune on it and one day 18 months ago I woke up and just decided enough was enough.'

Alison told her husband Andrew she was selling the car and going to have gastric band surgery.

'People say to me I was brave,' she said, 'but truly I have reached a point where I was mentally exhausted with dieting. I wanted to be fit, I wanted to stop dressing to disguise my body.'

Alison - left, at 14 years old weighing 13 stone, right, aged 19 weighing 11 stone - has been struggling with her weight since she was 10 and suffered a rheumatic fever

Aged 20, weighing 10 stone, the weight she is finally back to following her surgery

Alison first began gaining weight 
during an eight-month hospital stay after she was struck down by 
rheumatic fever when she was just ten years old.

She embarked on her first diet aged 17, when eating only grapefruit for every meal she lost nine pounds in three weeks.

At
one point the desperate dental hygienist even asked a colleague to wire
shut her mouth for three weeks, but lost three pounds after she took to
liquidising chocolate bars and drinking them through a straw.

Alison - left, aged 53 weighing 11 stone, and right, aged 
40, weighing 15 stone - embarked on her first diet aged 17, eating only 
grapefruit for every meal and losing 9lb in three weeks

Over the years Alison tried every diet going, wobbling between ten stone and her highest weight of 16.5 stone.

She
would often lose up to four stone at a time, but a holiday or special 
occasion would see her weight loss halt, and she would give up all 
together.

Between diets she 
would pile on the pounds snacking on cakes and eating meals the same 
size as those served to her teenage sons and husband.

And
whenever she embarked upon a new diet, Alison would gorge her face with
fish and chips in preparation for the deprivation ahead.

At the age of 45 Alison weighed 12 stone, but she still found the rest of the weight tricky to keep off

Alison Batchelor - here aged 54, weighing 16 stone - decided 18 months ago that enough was enough, and told her husband she was selling the car

So 18 months ago, when she finally 
gave up, the disheartened slimmer sold her brand new Ford Fiesta for 
£10,500 - the exact cost of her gastric surgery by the Bariatric Group 
at the Nuffield Health Hospital in Taunton, Somerset.

Surgeons
shortened her small intestine and stapled off most of her stomach to 
create a smaller pouch, so Alison physically cannot eat as much. Her 
stomach is the size of a walnut.

Now a svelte size 10/12, Alison weighs 9st 10lbs and says she is finally happier than ever.

Alison - here aged 50 and weighing 15 stone - says she believes she'll really keep the weight off this time

'For
me the surgery has been the most wonderful thing,' she said. I don't 
have to think about joining diets, I just eat what I want and every 
morning I get up and pull on a size 10 or 12 jeans.

'It's
incredible. I think it has changed my life. It has given me so much 
more confidence. I don’t have to hide under these baggy clothes anymore,
I can wear what I want.

'My husband Andrew says I am much happier... which is good for him.'

Alison, here aged 51 weighing 14 stone, says now that she has reached her ideal weight of 10 stone her husband tells her she is much happier
