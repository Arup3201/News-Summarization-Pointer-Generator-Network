A dashcam video captured the moment a Texas police officer saved a woman from an oncoming train on Sunday.

Officer Ramon Morales of the Richmond Police Department got out of his vehicle shortly after 1am and ran toward the woman as she sat on the tracks, police said in a release. They said a bystander flagged Morales down.

Morales is seen in the video pulling the woman away as track lights flash and the sounds of the oncoming train are heard.

The woman's sobs are audible as Morales manages to drag the woman in front of his vehicle - right before the train passes.

Morales is then seen holding on to the 
woman as he speaks on his radio. Police said this was to prevent her 
from running toward the train.

Police said the woman was transported to the hospital to be evaluated.

Morales, who has declined several interview requests with local media outlets, has been with the Richmond Police Department for only ten months, police said.

'Without regard for his own life, he immediately went into action,'Master Sgt. Lowell Neinast told KTRK of the former Marine. 'The second he pulled up, the crossing arms of the track started going down.'

'He went straight into action,' Neinast also said. 'He did a great job and we're proud of him. He's a hero.'
