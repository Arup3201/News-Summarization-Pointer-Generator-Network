An Army veteran who was today awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous leadership during a daylong firefight in Afghanistan wept as President Obama named his fallen comrades.

Former Staff Sgt. Clinton Romesha took a moment to compose himself after Obama read the names of the eight Americans who died in the 2009 firefight.

At a White House ceremony attended by the military's top leaders and former Medal of Honor recipients, Obama recounted the dramatic battle at an outpost in the mountains near the Pakistan border where U.S. troops were far outnumbered.

Sadness: Romesha was hurt in the attack but says his injuries are 'nothing' compared to his comrades'

Fifty-three U.S. troops were at the outpost 
when it came under fire by 300 Taliban fighters, and Romesha led
a fight against the enemy to protect the camp.

Eight U.S. soldiers were killed in the 
fighting and another 22 wounded, including Romesha, who was peppered with 
shrapnel from a rocket-propelled grenade but fought through his wounds.

Before the ceremony, Romesha's toddler son, Colin, charmed the attendees, including top military brass and government officials, by hiding behind President Obama's lectern.

A giggling Colin was eventually handed back to his mother, Tammy, after he was caught by a White House military aide.

Romesha and his wife of 13 years were also joined at the event by their other two children, Dessi and Gwen.

At the ceremony, Obama
said the U.S. troops fight courageously for freedom, for their country 
and for their families, but also to keep their fellow troops safe.

He said that a somber lesson could be drawn from Romesha's experience. 'Our troops should never ever be put in the position where they have to defend the indefensible,' he said.

Romesha, who bowed his head as Obama read his achievements, has dismissed his injuries as 'nothing' compared to those suffered by some of his fellow soldiers.

'I've had buddies that have lost 
eyesight and lost limbs,' Romesha said in a news conference last month 
after Obama called to tell him he would receive the award.

'I would rather give them all the 
credit they deserve for sacrificing so much. For me it was nothing, 
really. I got a little peppered, that was it.'

Jake
Tapper, a CNN anchor who wrote a book detailing the firefight, said 
many key officers at the outpost were away the day of the firefight and 
Romesha rose to the occasion and filled the leadership vacuum. But he 
says Romesha remains astonishingly humble.

'Everything was just about his buddies 
and trying to save his fellow soldiers and trying to do everything he 
could, literally everything he could, at great risk to his own life over
and over,' said Tapper, author of The Outpost: An Untold Story of 
American Valor.

'He's still very broken up about how he couldn't save everyone. He saved lives that day, without question, but eight of the guys died that day and that still tears him up.'

Romesha also served twice in Iraq and will be the fourth living Medal of Honor recipient for actions in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is the nation's highest military decoration for valor.

Romesha, who grew up in Lake City, Calif., deployed out of Fort Carson, Colo. He now lives in Minot, N.D., with his wife and three children and works in oil field safety.

Combat Outpost Keating sat in a valley and came under attack from the mountains on all four sides at 6 a.m. on Oct. 3, 2009.

An account of the fight by the Army says Romesha 'displayed extraordinary heroism through a daylong engagement in which he killed multiple enemy fighters, recovered fallen soldiers and led multiple recovery, resupply, and counterattack operations'.

When three Taliban fighters breached 
the camp's perimeter, Romesha shot and killed them with a rifle that 
belonged to the Afghan troops that he only had basic knowledge of.

They were among more than 10 Taliban that Romesha killed that day under heavy enemy fire, and he also directed air assaults to protect the camp and recovered the bodies of U.S. troops who died in the battle.

'We weren't going to be beat that day,' Romesha told last month's news conference. 'And seeing all those guys pull together, I mean you're not going to back down in the face of adversity like that. We were just going to win, plain and simple.'
