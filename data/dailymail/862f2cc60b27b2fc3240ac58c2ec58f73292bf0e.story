Vince Cable launched an astonishing attack on George Osborne during a Cabinet meeting by openly mocking the Chancellor’s claim that the UK is outperforming other European economies.

The Liberal Democrat Business Secretary stunned last week’s Cabinet by highlighting Mr Osborne’s repeated boast that the British Government could borrow money more cheaply than other European countries - because he claims that the markets back his austerity regime.

Cuttingly, Mr Cable said he ‘couldn’t help noticing’ that figures suggested the UK was actually ‘on a par’ with the much-maligned socialist-style French and Italian economies, which Mr Osborne has derided for being debt-laden and uncompetitive.

One source claimed: ‘When Cable spoke, George looked stormy. There was just the sound of indignant muttering from the Conservatives in the room.’

Mr Cable’s remarks will heighten tensions within the Coalition, which are already at breaking point with little more than three months to go until the General Election.

They will also increase suspicions that the Business Secretary is trying to align himself closer to Labour ahead of potential talks on a post-Election Lib-Lab pact, which could see the 71-year-old former Labour Party member finally achieve his ambition to become Chancellor.

When Mr Osborne appeared at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, he urged eurozone countries to copy his policy of slashing public spending and cited France and Italy as being in particular need of ‘structural reform’.

The Chancellor has repeatedly said in his Budget speeches that because of the strength of the British economy he has been able to borrow money more cheaply than most of our European competitors: the highest rates – known as bond yields – are charged by the City to countries with the greatest chance of going bust.

But at the Cabinet meeting, Mr Cable said: ‘I can’t help noticing that the bond yields of France and Italy are now on a par with ours.’

However, sources close to Mr Osborne insisted: ‘There was an exchange, but in it Cable agreed with George that the eurozone economies still pose a destabilising risk to the British economy. In fact, it is one of the few things George and Vince do agree about.’

Mr Osborne has repeatedly argued that low UK bond yields represent a pat on the back from investors for his spending cuts. Last week, the yield on ten-year bonds was 1.3 per cent for the UK, compared with 1.5 per cent for Italy and 0.5 per cent for France.

Last night, a senior Conservative source said that Mr Cable had irritated Tory Ministers in recent months by using meetings to praise the performance of the French economy under President Francois Hollande.

Like Ed Miliband, Hollande has criticised ‘the economics of austerity’, as practised by Mr Osborne, arguing that Europe needs a ‘different way forward’ to deal with the debt crisis. Mr Cable declined to comment last night.

Senior Tory MPs have been summoned to a showdown with Commons Leader William Hague tomorrow over controversial ‘English votes for English laws’ plans. Mr Hague will reveal how he intends to fulfil David Cameron’s promise to curb the power of Scots MPs to meddle in laws that affect only England. But MP Bernard Jenkin warned of a backlash if plans are watered down to meet objections from ‘Nationalist wreckers’.
