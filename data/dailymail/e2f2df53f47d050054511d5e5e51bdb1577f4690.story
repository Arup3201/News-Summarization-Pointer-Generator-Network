A model who caused a car crash after drinking so much sparkling wine she could hardly say her own name has walked free from court.

Motorbike calendar beauty Monica McDermott, 38, was almost four times the limit and could barely stand after she shared two bottles of Cava with friends at a business meeting.

But despite arranging a lift home, the blonde - a single mother to a six-year-old boy - decided to drive home after the networking event with a cosmetics company.

Ashamed: Monica McDermott walked free from Macclesfield Magistrates' Court

On her way home she ploughed her Nissan car into a stationary taxi, drove on and was seen stopping and starting, swerving across the road and mounting a grass verge.

A police officer who eventually stopped McDermott near her £200,000 apartment in the village of Alderley Edge, Cheshire, said she was so drunk he could only understand the word 'Monica' as she slurred out her name.

She was also so unsteady on her feet the officer had to hold her up to stop her falling over.

Although the model gave a roadside breath test, McDermott was too inebriated to give a second breath sample back at the police station.

Magistrates
in Macclesfield were told she woke up in a police cell the next morning
unable to recall any of her drunken driving jaunt the night before.

McDermott,
who models at Brands Hatch and featured on the SBK World Superbike 
Championship calendar, yesterday admitted failing to provide a breath 
test and was given an eight-week jail term suspended for 12 months.

She was also ordered to complete a six month community order during which she ill have to attend alcohol awareness course.

She was further banned from driving for two years and ordered to pay £100 costs.

Earlier Neil Audley, prosecuting, said that at 11.10pm on February 16 taxi driver Anthony Bentley was parked in Alderly Edge when he heard a crunching sound.

Banned: The model will not be allowed to drive for two years

He saw a silver Nissan drive off, with a blonde woman with a ponytail driving.

He took down the registration and called the police.

A police officer, who had taken down the details on making his way through Prestbury village towards Alderly Edge, saw the Nissan five minutes later.

'It was swerving and kept stopping and mounted the grass verge,' said Mr Audley.

'She was on her own in the car and when officers asked her to get out, her speech was slurred and they could smell intoxicants on her breath.

'They asked her name but could only understand "Monica"; they could not decipher anything else.

'They had to assist her because she was falling over.'

A roadside breathalyser showed a reading of 138microgrammes (mg) of alcohol in 100 mililitres of breath. The legal limit is 35mg.

McDermott was then to Middlewich police station but could not provide breath tests.

She was blowing into the bag to softly and then blowing too hard before speaking to the policeman.

He asked if there was any medical reasons as to why she couldn't but she said no.

The court heard McDermott had attended a meeting that evening between 4pm and 9pm with a cosmetics company and she drank Cava with friends.

Her lawyer, Daniel Brooks, said: 'She had no recollection of driving and arrangements had been put in place to leave her vehicle at the networking event.

'She had left the event to put her bag in the car but it seems to be one of those cases where she was so intoxicated that she made a drunk and irrational, stupid and out-of-character decision to drive.

'Her friends sent her text messages asking where she was.

'Instead of depositing her heavy handbag she drove.

'She had suffered a head injury and had no recollection of the incident, effectively waking up in the cell.

'This can be attributed to alcohol.

'She has no memory of what went on in that road and in the police station. It wasn't even a wilful refusal to give a breath sample - she made several attempts.

'At first she blew too hard and then too softly then started to speak to the officer about her son and lost concentration.

'She was effectively too drunk to do it.

'It is not lost on her how serious this is and what disastrous consequences could have followed.

'You will see from the report that she accepts full responsibility for the offence and has apologised to the taxi driver.

'She has been extremely scared about what could happen to her and she regrets her actions.

'She has been torturing herself about what went on on that night and what could happen.

'She works hard to provide for her son with little or no support. In terms of credit, she has provided a guilty plea.

'It would be a disaster for her and her child if she was taken into custody.

'She is at a low risk to harm to the public.

'This was a one-off offence. It is not somebody who has a significant alcohol history.

'This has been a wake-up call for Miss McDermott and it is unlikely that court will ever see her again.'

Passing sentence, magistrate Mr Peter Nash told McDermott: 'You were so intoxicated that you had no recollection of what happened but you have expressed remorse.

'However, we believe you have behaved recklessly and and you placed yourself and other road users in extreme danger.'
