Just when we thought the Darwin awards could take no more nominees, meet the people posing with the largest and most dangerous reptile in the world, all for a selfie.

Photos and video have appeared on social media of two young women smiling, posing and snapping photos with large crocodiles at Darwin's Fogg Dam Conservation Reserve.

In the video, a woman can be seen to be unfazed by the beast and takes nonchalant snaps mere metres from it's jaws.

Flirting with danger, the woman places a vodka bottle in front of the large croc and snaps a photo

A selfie posted on Instagram shows a young women a mere metre from a crocodile at Fogg Dam in Darwin

At one point the woman even places a Crystal Head Vodka bottle just centimetres from the distressed crocodile before he lunges into the air, to which she just laughs. 

In another case, on Instagram, a woman poses with another large crocodile for a selfie, captioning the image by stating she did not want to get much closer, even though she was just over a metre from its claws. 

The Northern Territory is littered with signs to warn people of the dangers of crocodiles 

The Parks and Wildlife Commission of the Northern Territory have issued a direct warning to those wanting to snap a selfie with a crocodile.

They have warned the public to be 'crocwise' and keep a safe distance of at least 15 metres. 

The Northern Territory is notorious for its freshwater and saltwater crocodile population, with certain areas averaging 15 crocodiles per kilometre. 

Salt water crocodiles can grow to five metres in length, weigh 450 kilograms and last year killed more people than any other year with the 'freshies' remaining more timid and fearful.

However, this does not rule out the possibility of an attack by a freshwater crocodile, especially with passerby's getting too close for comfort.

Just last January, a 12-year-old boy was taken by a crocodile while swimming with friends in a river in Kakadu.

As more and more people arrive to take photos, the distressed crocodile wanders back down the bank

And in June a 62-year-old man was taken, also in Kakadu, whilst he was fishing in his boat when a five-metre salt water crocodile launched itself into the boat, grabbing him and dragging him under the water while his distressed family watched from the river bank.

Even though the state is riddled with recognisable crocodile warning signs, tourists and locals seem to be downplaying the dangers for that next level selfie.
