A Chinese man almost blinded himself in one eye after impaling it on a giant metal hook. 

Wang Chenggen was using the rusty hook to pick up rubbish when he slipped and fell face first onto it.

The bizarre accident happened in Harbin, in China's Heilongjiang Province.

Horrifying x-rays show how the litter-pick embedded itself 5cm into Mr Chenggen's eye socket.

Another photo shows Mr Chenggen holding the hook while sitting down in an apparent attempt to hold it still and prevent it from causing any further damage.

The unlucky man's eye socket appears to bulge out where the entire curve of the fearsome-looking hook has embedded itself into his face.

And the full-extent of the invasion into his eye-socket is clear from the dried blood caked onto his face.

But despite the stomach-churning injury doctors who operated to remove the hook discovered that Mr Chenggen's eyeball had not been damaged.

Gruesome photos of the procedure show the steady-handed medics gently removing the hook.

And a snap taken after surgery shows just how big the hook is when placed next to a standard medical syringe. 

The lucky escape means that he will make a full recovery with his vision unaffected - although Mr Chenggen may want to swap the hook for a yard brush.
