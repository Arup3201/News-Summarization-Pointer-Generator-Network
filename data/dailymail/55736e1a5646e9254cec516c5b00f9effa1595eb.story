Justin Bieber has been accused of abusing a flight attendant on a private jet until she was forced to hide in the cockpit.

The troubled teen singer and his entourage were also said to have smoked so much marijuana on the flight between Canada and New Jersey that the pilots were forced to wear oxygen masks.

Bieber, 19, his father Jeremy, 38, and ten friends travelled on the leased jet to Teterboro airport ahead of the Superbowl and were allegedly so verbally abusive towards the female flight attendant that she refuses to work for him again.

Accused: When Justin Bieber, pictured in New York on Monday, flew a 
private jet from Canada to New York City to watch the Superbowl he 
allegedly smoked to much marijuana on the plane the pilots had to wear 
oxygen masks

Despite several warnings, the singer and his father Jeremy would not stop verbally abusing the flight attendant, and she eventually hid in cockpit with the pilots to avoid Bieber and his entourage.

According to an official report, Justin Bieber and his father Jeremy were 'extremely abusive' towards the flight attendant.

‘The captain of the flight stated that he warned the passengers, including Bieber, on several occasions to stop smoking marijuana,’ the official report of the incident, obtained by NBC News, reads.

‘The captain also stated he needed to request that the passengers stop their harassing behavior toward the flight attendant and after several warnings asked the flight attendant to stay with him near the cockpit to avoid any further abuse.’

On the morning after the jet was searched, Justin Bieber was spotted out in NYC posing for pictures with his adoring fans in the snow

In trouble again? Justin Bieber, seen here on Wednesday, may have once again come under suspicion for using drugs

The New York Post reported that police detected 'a strong odor of pot' and sent drug sniffing-dogs on board.

According to a TMZ report, the singer was flagged by US. Customs officials upon landing in New Jersey because he has two criminal cases pending in Florida and in his native Canada. 

News of the latest incident tops off a week full of legal trouble for the Canadian star.On Wednesday, he turned himself into Toronto authorities after being charged with assault.

TMZ reported that the fight with the limo driver began when Bieber asked for the music to be turned up.

The driver obliged, but not as much as Bieber was hoping, so he apparently stuck his hand through the partition to do it himself.

The driver swatted his hand away and then it errupted into a full-on smack fest as Bieber then hit the driver in the head multiple times.

He already faces a charge of driving under the influence after getting caught drag racing in Miami.

Bieber has pleaded not guilty to DUI, resisting arrest without violence and driving without a valid license in the Miami case.

A preliminary toxicology report released Thursday showed that he tested positive for marijuana and the anti-anxiety drug Xanax. Bieber told police after the arrest that he had been smoking marijuana and had taken a prescription drug, saying that his mother gave him the medication.

Bad week: Bieber was arrested for DUI in Miami last Thursday (pictured) and turned himself in on assault charges in Canada on Wednesday, but also has outstanding vandalism charges against him in California

His father was with him while they were in Florida and was at his side in Canada on Wednesday.

Late Thursday, Bieber posted a photo of his father, Jeremy, with a praise-filled caption.

'I have the greatest Dad in the world. He's taught me how to love, learn, and stay true to myself. I will forever be grateful because he was my superehero,' he wrote on his Instagram photo.

In California, the singer remains under investigation for an egg-tossing incident that left his neighbor's house with thousands of dollars in damage. If Bieber is charged in that case, a California judge may look at him more harshly in light of the Florida and Toronto cases, said Stan Goldman, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School, Los Angeles.

Bieber has not addressed the vandalism claim in California, and his attorney Howard Weitzman has said the singer's legal team believes their client is innocent in the Toronto case.

His court date for the Miami DUI incident has been set to March 3, two days after he turns 20.

A Miami-Dade County judge set trial for the three misdemeanors; driving under the influence, resisting arrest and driving with an invalid license.

Bieber's lawyers have already filed a written plea of not guilty and initial trial dates are often delayed.
