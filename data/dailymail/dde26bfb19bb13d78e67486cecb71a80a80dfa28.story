Controversial union giant Unite handed Labour almost £800,000 after Ed Miliband dropped his inquiry into claims it had been involved in vote-rigging.

Official figures yesterday revealed that Unite donated £777,740 a fortnight after the Labour leader reinstated two union members who had been suspended over allegations of trying to fix the selection of a new parliamentary candidate in the safe seat of Falkirk.

The huge cheque was almost a quarter of the £3.1million donated to the party in the third quarter of this year.

The Unite union, run by Len McCluskey, was Labour's biggest donor in the third quarter of 2013, despite the public spat with Ed Miliband (right) over allegations of vote-rigging in Falkirk

Labour sources insisted there was  
‘absolutely no link’ between the donation and the dropping of the 
inquiry into the Falkirk scandal. A source said the cash was a regular 
instalment of affiliation fees taken from union members’ subs.

But
Tory chairman Grant Shapps seized on the payment as evidence that Mr 
Miliband is compromised by his financial dependence on Unite and its 
militant boss Len McCluskey.

Mr
Shapps said: ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promises of change, nothing has 
changed. The union bosses still buy the policies, fix the selections and
pick the leader. It’s the same old Labour.

‘If
Ed Miliband is serious about standing up to Len McCluskey, he should 
reopen his inquiry into the Unite union’s attempt to fix the Labour 
Party selection in Falkirk. If he’s too weak to  govern his party, Ed 
Miliband is too weak to govern the country.’

A
Labour source said the bumper payment was a regular instalment of 
affiliation fees, adding: ‘These payments are made on a scheduled basis 
at agreed times throughout the year, unrelated to any other matter.’

The
source went on: ‘There is absolutely no link. Throughout the Falkirk 
matter our motivation has always been, and will continue to be, to 
uphold the integrity of the Labour Party.’

The
party faced further discomfort over the Falkirk scandal yesterday after
leaked emails suggested Labour’s general secretary Iain McNicol had 
struck a secret deal with Mr McCluskey to allow the union to sign up new
members in the constituency in the run-up to the selection meeting.

Unite is alleged to have signed up a number of local people in Falkirk 
as Labour members without their knowledge.

The
emails show that Unite’s favoured candidate Karie Murphy, who is 
employed as office manager for Labour’s former deputy chairman Tom 
Watson, was pushing for these new members to be formally recognised by 
the party in time for the selection meeting.

She
said a deal had been ‘agreed’ between ‘Lennie’ and Mr McNicol for their
direct debit details to be collected after the selection process had 
taken place.

David Cameron's Conservatives received the most donations in the three-month period, with a total of £3,275,185

In July, Mr Miliband attacked the selection process in Falkirk for fuelling ‘growing mistrust in politics’.

But
an internal inquiry was dropped in September after evidence was 
‘withdrawn’. Mr Miliband has ruled out reopening the inquiry, despite a 
string of fresh allegations, saying it is time to ‘move on’.

Yesterday’s
donation figures from the Electoral Commission show Mr Miliband remains
heavily dependent on the unions, which gave Labour £2.6million in the 
third quarter – equal to 75 per cent of its total donations.

The
figures also reveal that Labour has had its overdraft limit cut to just
£90,000 after  running up debts totalling £12.3million.

By comparison, the Tories now have an overdraft limit of  £10million, along with debts of just under £1.8million.

The
largest Conservative donors were Addison Lee taxi boss John Griffin, 
with £500,000, City financier Michael Farmer, with £250,000, and 
investment banker James Lupton, with £250,000. The party also received 
£14,000 from Scottish Power, which angered customers last month by 
increasing bills by 8.6 per cent.

Labour
shadow Cabinet Office minister Michael Dugher said: ‘It looks like big 
money donations get you a seat at the Prime Minister’s top table. 
Private dinners with David Cameron and senior Tories have raked in well 
over £1million for the Tories in the last three months.’

The
Liberal Democrats received £798,408 in donations, including £167,000 
from the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust. Other donors included the London 
Duck Tours company, which gave the party £5,000 shortly before one of 
its flagship vehicles caught fire and sank in the Thames. The Lib Dems 
have debts of £366,000 and a £1million overdraft limit.
