It's renowned the world over as the home town of the Fab Four. Now one businessman in Liverpool is offering what is, arguably, the must-stay experience for any self-respecting Beatles fan.

A narrowboat has been converted into a floating hotel - and painted to look like the Yellow Submarine on the cover of the Fab Four's iconic album.

The 80-ft vessel-turned hotel is moored at Liverpool's Albert Dock and is the brainchild of eccentric businessman Alfie Bubbles.

Far out: The psychedelic interiors of the boat also feature a scooter from the film Quadrophenia in the lounge

Featuring more than a few Mod-cons, an original scooter from the film Quadrophenia sits in the psychedelic lounge, while the three bedrooms - boasting decor inspired by the 1969 album - all come fitted with 3D televisions, computers and wi-fi.

Mr Bubbles admitted seeking out all the fixtures and fittings for the refurbishment - which took nine months - had been a 'massive job'.

The
boat was previously owned by Paramount Pictures and used in their thriller 
The Hunt for the Red October, starring Sean Connery, which was partly 
filmed in Liverpool waters.

Mr
Bubbles, who also runs Hollywood Limousines, hopes to complete a fleet 
of floating hotels he will design himself - including Titanic and Black 
Pearl vessels.

He added: 'It will all be from my crazy head!'

The
former freight company owner came up with the idea of a floating hotel 
last year and his first Joker-themed moat-tel has been a huge success.

The
53 year-old has been buoyed by the popularity of the Batman theme and 
bookings have been taken from China, the US, Japan and the UK until 
October.

Rooms are priced at £149 per night, from Monday to Thursday, and £299 and £350 from Friday to Sunday.

Psychedelic: An image from the film

The Beatles always denied the song Yellow Submarine had any hidden meaning or referred to drugs.

Paul McCartney who wrote it, said at the time of its release: 'It's a fun song, a children's song.

'Originally
we intended it to be 'Sparky' a children's record. But now it's the 
idea of a yellow submarine where all the kids went to have fun.

'I
was just going to sleep one night and thinking if we had a children's 
song, it would be nice to be on a yellow submarine where all your 
friends are with a band.'

However many music fans believe the song is really a reference to the mind-bending hallucinogenic drug LSD.

It was written at the height of the Beatles psychedelic period, when they were known to be experimenting with the drug.

In the 60s a variety of LSD sold in pill form, was reportedly known as 'yellow submarines'.

Analysing
the lyrics,  the 'man that sailed the shore' reportedly refers to a 
drug dealer, while the line 'Our friends are all aboard', supposedly 
meant their friends were doing drugs too.

The film itself is awash with colourful psychedelic-style
images, weird and whacky characters. The villains of the story are the 
'Blue Meanies', who are supposed to represent the police.    

Notably it also includes the song Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds which Paul Mccartney admitted was 'obviously' about drugs.
