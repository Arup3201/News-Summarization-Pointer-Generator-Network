July - the month in which Prince George of Cambridge was born - is often the busiest month for births, figures suggest.

Data obtained by the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) shows July was the busiest month on England's labour wards for five out of the 11 years up to and including 2011.

More boys than girls are born in every month of every year, according to the analysis of figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

July - the month in which Prince George of Cambridge was born - is often the busiest month for births in England, figures from the Royal College of Midwives have shown

They were published following a parliamentary question by Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives Andrew George.

It comes after figures published by the ONS last week showed the number of babies born in the UK is at its highest for four decades.

A total of 813,200 births were recorded between June 2011 and June 2012, giving the UK its biggest baby boom since 1972.

The rise has been attributed to larger numbers of women in their 20s and 30s becoming mothers, along with an increase in the number of migrant families.

The new analysis shows there were 
174,653 more boys than girls born in England from 2001 to 2011. This 
means for every 100 girls born, there were 105 boys.

When
the birth data is split by region, September is the most popular month 
for boys in the North East, while in the North West it is August and in 
the West Midlands it is October.

Figures for girls show similar variations. In the East Midlands, July and September are jointly the most popular months for girls, whilst in the South East and South West, October comes out top.

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: ‘These are fun statistics but with a serious message behind them: not only is the baby boom continuing apace but even within years there are peaks of activity that put additional, acute pressure on midwives.

‘The Government realises that there is a real need for more midwives and isn't shy about admitting it.

‘We know they are putting extra investment into training more midwives and that is really welcome, especially given the pressure on the public finances.

‘What we now need to see is extra effort from trusts up and down the country to staff maternity services appropriately.

‘We need to see women getting adequate antenatal care, and importantly much better postnatal care.

‘Giving women support, advice and care in those first days and weeks is incredibly important, and that's true whether it is a boy, a girl, or even a prince.’
