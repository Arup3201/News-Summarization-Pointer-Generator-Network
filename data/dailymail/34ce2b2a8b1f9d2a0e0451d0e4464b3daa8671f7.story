A man who stamped, kicked and punched an elderly businessman to death in what a judge said was 'a truly awful offence' has been told he will serve a minimum of 26-and-a-half years in prison.

Imran Khan, 30, attacked and robbed Panache Lingerie founder Anthony Power in a Sheffield park before making off with the keys to his luxury Bentley.

Mr Power, 78, was left severely brain damaged in the ferocious attack and died later in hospital.

Khan was found guilty of murdering Mr Power today following a three day trial and little more than an hour of jury deliberations at Sheffield Crown Court.

Attacked: Anthony Power, 78, died from the injuries he sustained at the hands of Imran Khan, 30. Khan was found guilty of murder and will serve a minimum of 26-and-a-half years in prison for the 'truly awful' crime

Judge Alan Goldsack QC jailed Khan, of Darnall in Sheffield, for life and told he must serve at lest 26-and-a-half years before he is considered for release.

Judge Goldsack told him: 'It was a truly awful offence.'

The court heard how grandfather Mr Power had gone into High Hazels Park, in the Darnall area of Sheffield, on October 8 last year to look for his brother, who has dementia.

Mr Power's son said: 'The horrific way our dad died will not define his life - 78 years of living life to the full will define him.'

He was found by police with serious head injuries and with his personal property and even his false teeth strewn around the park.

Khan had been drinking large quantities of vodka and brandy in the park with a friend.

He was later spotted by Mr Power’s niece sitting in the businessman’s Bentley, which was parked nearby, and ran off when she challenged him.

Mr Power was taken to hospital but never recovered and his ventilator was turned off more than two weeks after he was brought in.

The jury heard how Khan’s clothes were found to be covered in Mr Power’s blood.

Today, Judge Goldsack told Khan: 'You clearly made a decision to rob Mr Power.'

'Mr Power was not going to let go of his property without a struggle.

'The extent and ferocity of your attack upon him grew as you were clearly determined to take his property.'

The judge added: 'He suffered massive brain damage. If he had survived he would probably have been totally incapacitated.'

Khan, who also admitted attacking two other people on that night and damaging the home of an ex-girlfriend, showed no emotion as he left the dock, watched by many members of Mr Power’s family.

Judge Goldsack paid tribute to the businessman, noting how he had risen from a 'poor but happy' childhood in Ireland to be a successful businessman.

The judge said Mr Power had been married for 52 years, had four children and a number of grandchildren and lived for his family.

'He provided employment for many people and clearly ran his business very much along the lines of a further extended family,' the judge said.

Vicious attack: Mr Power was set upon in Hazels Park in Sheffield and was found covered in blood with multiple fractures to his face and 'catastrophic' damage to his brain

'Many people outside the family have felt this loss personally.'

'They all have the sympathy of the court.'

Outside court, Mr Power’s son, Danny, said: 'The horrific way our dad died will not define his life - 78 years of living life to the full will define him.

'The countless fun and inspirational memories he has left us with will define him.

'His generosity, integrity and hard work will define him.

'He was much more than a man who just drove a nice car.

'He was fearless and worked harder than any man we’ve known.

He added: 'He went from sharing a room with 11 siblings in Ireland to sharing a caravan with my mum in Sheffield to creating one of the leading lingerie firms in this country.

'Within all that work, he was there for us as our fun-loving dad and we will work hard to make him proud.'

Detective Inspector Martin Tate, the Senior Investigating Officer in the case, said: 'This was a tragic and unnecessary loss of life.

'I’m pleased with today’s verdict and that Imran Khan has been held to account for his actions.

'My thoughts remain with Anthony Power’s family, who can hopefully take some comfort now that justice has been done.'
