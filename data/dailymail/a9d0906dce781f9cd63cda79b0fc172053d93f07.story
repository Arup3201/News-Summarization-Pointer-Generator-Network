A 54-year-old Massachusetts woman has been charged with replacing a statue of the baby Jesus with a severed pig's head on Christmas Day.

The homeless woman was arrested after being photographed defacing the doors and walls of another church on December 30. 

Amarillis Cermeno will be arraigned on Friday in Haverhill District Court on charges that include larceny, destruction of a place of worship, and malicious destruction of property, Lieutenant Robert Pistone said at a press conference.

54-year-old homeless woman, Amarillis Cermeno (pictured), appeared in court in December having been caught defacing another Haverhill church by writing the number of the devil - 666 -  on its walls

Church-goers were shocked to discover the pig's head in the center of the Nativity scene outside the Sacred Hearts Roman Catholic parish church on Christmas morning. It was initially feared that it was a hate crime

It is alleged that the homeless woman found the pig's head while rummaging in garbage for food in the town of Haverhill, Massachusetts, and left it in place of the figure of the baby Jesus in the early hours of Christmas morning outside the Sacred Hearts Roman Catholic Parish church. 

It was initially feared that the act was a hate crime. 

However, Cermeno was arrested on December 30 after she was caught writing the number 666 – identified in the New Testament as the number of the devil – on the doors of a local Spanish-language Baptist church.

Brian Bly, a neighbor, tried to get Cermeno's attention, and told CBS Boston that he photographed her as she walked away having written the number '666' some 15 times in black marker on the outside of the church.

When cops apprehended her a short while later, Cermeno swung a large metal crucifix at them, authorities say.

While she denied any knowledge of the pig's head and missing baby Jesus, the crucifix was traced back to the Sacred Hearts church and the desecrated Nativity scene.

Officials say they believe that Cermeno's motivation is likely to be the result of a mental condition.

Speaking at Haverhill police headquarters, Pistone said: 'We are confident that this crime was not a crime of hatred, but rather the act of an individual who appears to be mentally ill.'

Haverhill Mayor James J. Fiorentini, said: 'People in the community were shocked by this, that it was a desecration of one of our holiest places.'

'We are all very glad that this isn't what it originally appeared to be. It doesn't appear to be [an act by] a hate group. We don't have that kind of people in our community.'

Describing the discovery of the pig's head on Christmas Day and the subsequent media coverage, Reverend John Delaney said: 'We were shocked. Horrified. Saddened.'

He added: 'Now, we can pray for this woman.'

Cermeno is undergoing a court-ordered mental health evaluation which will take at least 20 days.

Cermeno was apprehended after being caught using a black marker pen to write the number 666 on the walls and door of a Haverhill Spanish-language Baptist church

Pistone declined to say if the statue of Jesus had been recovered, and few other details were given about the investigation.

Cermeno had recently been seen preaching to passersby, had visited the police department to share her views on religion with officers, and had been noticed begging outside of the courthouse.

Pistone noted that Cermeno had attended services at the Roman Catholic church on December 14 and 21 without incident. 'I do not believe she is anti-religion,' he said. 'I believe, at times, when mentally ill people go into crisis mode, certain behaviors become evident.'
