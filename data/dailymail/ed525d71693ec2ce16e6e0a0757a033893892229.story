Margaret Thatcher's spectacular ceremonial funeral cost the taxpayer £3.6million, it emerged today.

The final bill for the ceremony at St Paul's Cathedral was around a third of the £10million which opponents on the left had claimed it would be.

Downing Street said confirmed that Lady Thatcher's family would be making a contribution to the overall cost - including covering the costs of the undertakers and the flowers.

The £3.6million total includes £2million for policing by 4,000 officers who would have been on duty anyway.

The Cabinet Office said the estimated costs for the funeral ceremony was around £500,000.

This figure includes costs incurred by St Paul’s Cathedral, the Ministry of Defence, the Foreign Office, the invitation printers, and staff overtime.

Additional policing and security costs came to around £1.1 million.

On the morning of the funeral, Labour frontbencher Diane Abbott complained about the bill.

'There is just no precedent, it’s a breach of protocol and it’s going to cost £10million,' she claimed, in what now appears to be a vast overestimate.

Full details of all public money spent on Lady Thatcher’s funeral will be published before the end of July,

More than 2,300 mourners joined Lady Thatcher's daughter Carol and son Mark at the ceremony.

The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition to attend the funeral of a former Prime Minister for the first time since Winston Churchill.

All 32 members of the Cabinet attended the ceremony, along with Labour leader Ed Miliband and former Prime Ministers Gordon Brown, Tony Blair and Sir John Major

Thousands of people lined the streets of central London to watch the procession, including a horse-drawn gun carriage, pass

Baroness Thatcher was honoured with a sombre but spectacular funeral ceremony that paid tribute to the ‘courage and perseverance’ of Britain's greatest peacetime prime minister.

Under the great dome of St Paul's Cathedral, the Queen joined dignitaries from 170 countries worldwide, friends, political foes and Lady Thatcher's closest family members to celebrate the life of the UK's first and only female premier.

London's streets were also packed with mourners who broke into spontaneous applause and gave cheers and whistles of support as the coffin passed by on Wednesday last week.

The emotional crowds threw white roses in the path of the gun carriage that carried Lady Thatcher through the capital, while many of the 2,300 inside St Paul's openly sobbed with Chancellor George Osborne 'overwhelmed'.

Outside on the streets, the predicted protests and disorder failed to materialise, with the few boos drowned out by supporters' applause.

As Big Ben once again started to chime after the 11am service, the procession started its final journey.

Lady Thatcher's twins Sir Mark and Carol looked moved throughout and her grandchildren Michael and Amanda were waiting at the cathedral door holding cushions bearing the insignia of the Order of the Garter and the Order of Merit, which they then placed on the Dome Altar as the coffin arrived.

Margaret Thatcher's only granddaughter also paid a heartfelt tribute to the former Prime Minister with a perfectly-delivered reading.

Speaking with a pronounced American accent, Amanda Thatcher, 19, read from the book of Ephesians to mourners.

The teenager showed how she takes after her grandmother as she spoke with self-assurance and confidence during the service in front of the Queen, former Prime Ministers and foreign dignitaries

Amanda's reading called for the righteous to put 'on the whole armour of God that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil'.
