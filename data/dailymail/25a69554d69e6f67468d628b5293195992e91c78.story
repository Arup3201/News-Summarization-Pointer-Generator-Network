When Sophie Dahl broke into modelling in 1997, she was the hottest face - and body - of the time.

Under the guidance of Storm, the agency that discovered Kate Moss, Sophie appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen and Patrick Cox.

But two daughters and nearly two decades later, she admits that her life now is worlds away from that scene – and she never really knew what all the fuss was about.

Ask me when I'm 50! Sophie Dahl, pictured here at the BRIT Awards in February, has opened up about her attitude to aging in a new interview

In a refreshingly honest interview with Style magazine, Sophie, who was first discovered by fashion stylist icon Isabella Blow, also discusses her relaxed attitude to beauty and aging.

‘At the moment I don’t feel too traumatised by aging and ultimately would much rather be in my mid-thirties than my twenties, but ask me again when I’m 50,’ she says. ‘I am in slight mourning about the hollows under my eyes but that’s it. I have nothing against a good facelift.’

Sophie, the daughter of writer Tessa Dahl and granddaughter of the late children’s author Roald Dahl, became the face of Yves Saint Laurent’s perfume, Opium, in 2000.

It featured the then 22-year old naked, lying provocatively on black satin sheets with her blonde hair dyed deep red.

Directed by Tom Ford and  shot by Steven Meisel, it became one of the most controversial and complained-about adverts of all time, criticised for it’s apparently overtly sexualisation and objectification of women.

‘It feels like such a long time ago, another life,’ Dahl told Style. ‘I think it’s something I will look back on and get a kick out of. I never really understood all the fuss.’

The model, who described her beauty routine as low maintenance also said her makeup regime was minimal these days, too, applying just mascara and eyeliner to brighten up her face if she felt that she looked tired.

She also said she was cautious about putting on too much makeup in front of her daughters – Lyra, three and Margot, 14 months.

‘I think with girls you have a real responsibility in terms of how you discuss the physical,’ she says. ‘Talking about your looks or body in a derogatory way doesn’t do them any favours.’

It’s not the first time Sophie has spoken of her comfort with getting older – an attitude she credits largely to having children and having a supportive husband: She and the jazz musician Jamie Cullum wed in a secret winter wonderland ceremony in 2010.

She told Style that she felt most beautiful when they were on a rare date night together and, earlier this year, gushed that he helps bring out the best in her.

‘I'm married to a really, really good guy,’ Sophie told Red magazine in January. ‘He's intensely curious and engaged with life. When you meet someone who really sees you, it gives you the emotional freedom to pursue your dreams.'

She also said that, after the birth of first daughter Lyra, she stopped fussing about the small things.

‘Having children was very liberating,’ she said. 'They were suddenly the reason, much more important than any petty, navel-gazing feelings I'd indulged in before.'

Despite her runway success as a model, Dahl has a huge passion for writing and cooking.

She regularly writes for newspapers and magazines, has written two cook books and presented a cooking series and documentaries on TV.

Running a website is Sophie’s latest venture: www.sophiedahl.com, or At the Kitchen Table as it is called, is a collection of recipes, columns, blogs and magazine-style features.

She told Red that not only is it the perfect home for all her own writing, she gets her family and friends to contribute as well, and it’s the perfect place for everything she wants to read.
