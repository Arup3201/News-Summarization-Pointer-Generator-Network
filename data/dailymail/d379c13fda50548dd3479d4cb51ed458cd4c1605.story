Lewis Hamilton insisted he felt comfortable in chasing down and passing title rival Nico Rosberg at a rainy Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday.

The race in Suzuka was overshadowed by a crash involving Marussia's Jules Bianchi, who was left requiring surgery after suffering severe head injuries following a collision with a recovery vehicle.

But, in terms of the now trivial battle between the Mercedes duo for this year's drivers' championship, Hamilton was the man to come out on top - picking up a third consecutive win to move 10 points clear of his German colleague.

With Typhoon Phanfone sending plenty of wet weather towards the circuit, the race was red-flagged after just two laps despite starting under safety car conditions.

Hamilton set about passing pole-sitter Rosberg once enough standing water had been cleared to allow the race to begin in earnest.

And, even though he was following closely behind his team-mate for several laps, Hamilton felt in control of the race.

'Nico and I had a tough battle, we were pushing really hard,' he said.

'I had a big moment at turn one when I was too late getting off the DRS as I was just pushing so hard but fortunately I was able to get back on track.

'The conditions were difficult throughout but I had more pace than Nico and could follow him quite comfortably in the early stages.

'This is not an easy circuit for following another car or for overtaking, but he made a mistake out of the last corner and I was able to pass. The whole approach then needed to change to look after the tyres and make sure I stayed in the lead until the end of the race.'

This was Hamilton's maiden victory at Suzuka and comes at a crucial time in his quest for a second world championship. Rosberg had out-performed the Brit in Saturday's dry qualifying session but was left conceding it was a case of "damaged limitations" after he came out second-best on race day.

'I struggled a lot with the balance of my car on the intermediate tyres, so I had to push hard to keep Lewis behind me,' he said.

'I had a lot of oversteering which is why the rear end of my car was very nervous. That was really strange and I didn't have the necessary confidence in the corners; we need to look into that in the next few days.

'It meant that Lewis was quicker today and deserved the win. It was damage limitation with losing only seven points to him. For the team it was a good result with another one-two.'

Sebastian Vettel, who announced on Saturday he was to leave Red Bull at the end of the season, took the final place on the podium after being the fastest man on track during the middle stages of the race.

His team-mate Daniel Ricciardo, who will lead the team when Vettel completes his widely-anticipated move to Ferrari, was fourth with Jenson Button unfortunate to only come home fifth having enjoyed one of his best performances of the season.

The 2009 champion peeled off into the pits to change from full wet tyres and onto the intermediate option as soon as the safety car had come in.

And Button benefited from the decision as those left on track followed his lead - with the McLaren man moving up into third place as a result.

The ultimately superior pace of the Red Bull duo meant the 34-year-old could not take his first podium since the opening race in Australia, with his future still a mystery as rumours Fernando Alonso is to return to the Woking-based team.

But McLaren race director Eric Boullier was happy with the performance of Button, as the team continues to fight with Force India over fifth place in the constructors's standings.

Jenson Button put in one of his best performances of the season to finish in fifth place

'Jenson was the first driver in the field to stop to fit Intermediates, and, having done so, thereafter he drove very well all afternoon,' said Boullier.

'Indeed, he may well have finished third had things panned out better for us at the end of the race in terms of Safety Car and pit-stop timing.

'Even so, the 10 points he scored for fifth place may well be useful to us in our efforts to move up the Constructors' Championship table.'
