Sixth-formers at a highly-rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about Hitler, pictured, using a Lego kit

A fresh row over ‘dumbing down’ in the classroom has broken out after A-level students were taught about Hitler using Lego people.

Sixth-formers at a highly-rated secondary school were asked to discuss myths about Hitler using a Lego kit containing figures and building blocks.

The exercise involved pupils being asked questions such as ‘why is Hitler wearing a witch’s hat?’, which prompted the response ‘to show the spell that Hitler put on Germany’.

The teacher responsible for the lesson at Rossett School in Harrogate posted details on his blog as an example for others to follow, leading to it being circulated widely on Twitter.

An online backlash ensued on student and teacher forums, with critics branding the exercise ‘unacceptable dumbing down’.

The row follows the revelation in 2013 by former Education Secretary Michael Gove that GCSE pupils were being encouraged to learn about the Nazis using Mr Men characters.

He highlighted a teaching resources website – ActiveHistory - which suggested ‘depicting Hitler’s rise as a Mr Men story’. He told teachers ‘it reduces the history of Germany’s darkest years to a falling out between Mr Tickle and Mr Topsy-Turvy’.

Mr Gove insisted reforms to the curriculum and exams being phased in from 2014 onwards would improve lessons.

But critics claimed little had been learned from the Mr Men debacle after details emerged of the Lego lesson for A-level students.

David West, the teacher who delivered the lesson, insisted it was ‘creative’ and ‘memorable’ while not compromising on ‘depth and detail’.

He said it had produced ‘high quality’ work that was ‘better than it would have been’ had the lesson followed its usual course.

The lesson, which took place during the autumn term, used a StoryStarter kit produced by Lego Education for pupils in key stages one and two – ages four to 11. It contained assorted characters, animals accessories and basic bricks.

Pupils were required to investigate the personality cult created around Hitler by Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels using Lego scenes.

On his blog, Mr West recalled: ‘The students were really engaged on the task and produced very creative solutions.

‘“Why is Hitler wearing a witches hat?” “To show the spell that Hitler put on Germany.”

‘“Why is Hitler waving to a cat?” “He is giving up his personal happiness to devote himself to the nation.”

‘“Why is the spider laid like that?” “He is giving the Nazis salute showing how devoted all his people were”.’

But one critic on the Student Room website said they were ‘most concerned by the embarrassingly low demand of the task’ and the ‘laughably shallow’ level of analysis required.

Another wrote: ‘I think creative teaching methods are great but if this – “Why is Hitler wearing a witch’s hat?” “To show the spell that Hitler put on Germany” - is the quality of analysis your AS students are producing then I’d say that’s a problem.’

There was further criticism from fellow teachers on the TES forum, with one dismissing the lesson as ‘anti-intellectual nonsense’.

One said: ‘I don’t believe such a lightweight exercise delivered through such as trivial, jokey medium would prompt any serious thought or insight into Hitler or propaganda.’

Another mocked Mr West’s ‘fancy’ title - Leadership Secondment for Learning Experience – and said it was ‘worrying’ that he believed ‘getting 6th formers to play with lego is a valid teaching strategy’.

And they said: ‘I encounter a lot of younger colleagues who appear to believe that a productive lesson somehow involves entertainment. It’s an attitude usually accompanied by the almost constant use of the words guys and bud.’

Following the backlash, Mr West wrote a follow-up blog describing his experience of being ‘panned’ on the internet and complaining about ‘incredibly negative and offensive posts’.

‘Having discussed this with my colleagues, and with several of my sixth form students, I have been struck by support I have received,’ he said.

‘Several students have spoken to me about how much they got out of the lesson and how it has helped them think about the topic of propaganda.

‘I realise how lucky I am to work where I do.

‘In the face of this abuse I have had to be resilient, it would have been easy to delete my blog, it would be easy to stop sharing my work, it would be easy to stop innovating, it would be easy to keep my head down and let the bullies win.’

But he said ‘there is absolutely no way that I will stop trying to innovate’.

The school where he works has been rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted.

There is debate in some quarters, however, over the extent to which the watchdog is dismissive of traditional teaching and welcoming of practices such as ‘independent learning’, group work and bite-size activities.

Sir Michael Wilshaw, the chief inspector, said he was ‘enraged’ by claims made in a report in March 2014 that some inspectors prefer certain teaching styles. However he insisted it was incorrect to suggest that Ofsted was ‘full of lefty, hippy types’.
