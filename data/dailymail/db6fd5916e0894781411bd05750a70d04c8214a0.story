Free: Eric Joyce will not face charges over his arrest in the Houses of Parliament earlier this week

MP Eric Joyce will not face charges over an alleged fight in the Houses of Parliament which saw him wrestled to the ground, it was announced today.

The former Labour MP, who serves as an independent after being kicked out of the party, was arrested on suspicion of assault earlier this month, and then re-arrested at the police station on suspicion of actual bodily harm.

But Scotland Yard today said that Mr Joyce will face no further action in relation to the incident.

'A man aged in his fifties, arrested 
on Thursday 14 March on suspicion of assault and ABH in connection with a
 disturbance in a bar within the House of Commons, and bailed to a 
central London police station has been released with no further action 
today,' the Metropolitan Police said in a statement.

A dozen police officers were called to a
 fracas at the Sports and Social bar in the Houses of Parliament on March 14, where Mr Joyce was at a karaoke night.

The MP
 was reportedly wrestled to the ground by officers in front of onlookers
 and loaded into a police van, and was subsequently banned from buying 
alcohol within the premises.

The Crown Prosecution Service said: 'The CPS received a complete file on 26 March in relation to events at the Sports and Social Club within the Palace of Westminster on 14 March 2013, following which Eric Joyce MP was arrested.

'The file related to allegations of assault and after careful consideration we have concluded there is insufficient evidence to charge Mr Joyce with any offences in connection with this incident.

'Although there appears to have been an incident on the evening in question, evidence obtained from witnesses contained multiple inconsistencies and there is insufficient evidence that Mr Joyce committed any offence.'

Arrest: Joyce is restrained and handcuffed before being taken away by police on March 14

Scene: Inside the Sports and Social Bar at the Houses of Parliament, where Joyce was arrested

The 52-year-old former soldier was 
arrested last February over a brawl at the nearby Strangers’ bar in 
Parliament where he headbutted Tory MP Stuart Andrew.

He
 pleaded guilty to four counts of common assault and was fined £3,000 by
 magistrates, and later resigned from the Labour party and agreed
 not to stand for re-election.

Onlookers at the Sports and Social this month said Mr Joyce brought two officers to the ground and knocked another’s hat off.

It is believed he arrived at the venue earlier in the evening after drinking in a Westminster pub with one of his staff.

Initial
 reports suggest an altercation began between Mr Joyce and another man, 
which was continued outside the bar. Witnesses called the police who 
arrived at 10.45pm.

They had to call for reinforcements to deal with the incident. Mr Joyce was eventually pinned him to the ground and handcuffed.

He was said to have been bundled through the members’ entrance to the Palace of Westminster and driven away.

After the incident, Joyce said he had had two glasses of wine, 
adding: 'There was no question of me being p****d.'

But he freely admitted he struggled to control his temper. 'I'm quite aggressive when poked and I was poked,' he said.
