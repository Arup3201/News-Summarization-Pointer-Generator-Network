If you have always fancied getting up close to a predator, this is your chance. 

A theme park is offering  visitors the opportunity to go face-to-face with a deadly 16ft-long crocodile.

Pictured underwater, plucky tourists are offered the chance to swim with the huge snapper, coming within inches of its huge jaws.

Say cheese! Daredevils try out the underwater attraction at Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, Australia, just inches from a huge crocodile

Underwater adventure: The nine-foot-high container is known as the Cage Of Death, and protects thrillseekers from the giant reptile

Guests get up close to crocs including Chopper - who is 86 years old and has a varied diet including buffalo, chicken, beef heart and fish

Thrillseekers will be contained in a nine-foot-high, acrylic container, known as the Cage Of Death, which protects them should the reptile - called Chopper - attack.

The 20-minute underwater experience is available at Australia's Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin City.

After being suspended above the enclosure, guests are then lowered into the water whilst the scaly 58-stone beast is fed huge chunks of meat right before their eyes.

Wearing only googles and their swimming costume, adrenaline junkies can then watch the croc thrash around in the water as it feeds on a mix of chicken, buffalo, chicken and fish.

A spokesman for Crocosaurus Cove said: 'People have a mix of fear and excitement when they enter the cage, the fear of not knowing what to expect and the excitement of getting so close to an animal this big.

'Chopper is a 5.5-metre saltwater croc, weighs more than 58 stone and is very inquisitive.

'The cage is very safe, it's made of 15.5cm clear acrylic which gives you a panoramic view of the croc eating.

'Having people inside the cage encourages crocs to eat, they are very opportunistic feeders and will take any opportunity they can to eat.

'Chopper is approximately 86 years old and has a varied diet including buffalo, chicken, beef heart and fish.

'He loves to get close to people entering his enclosure and has been known to snap at the cage.'
