Harsh words: Lord Mandelson attacked both Ed Balls and former Labour leader Gordon Brown

Lord Mandelson has launched a devastating attack on Ed Balls - and admitted that the last Labour Government left behind a wrecked economy.

The former Labour Business Secretary ridiculed Gordon Brown’s infamous claim to have abolished boom and bust, joking: ‘Well we abolished boom!’

And, in a thinly-veiled swipe at Mr Balls, he said; ‘We need to explain how we would retool and redevelop our economy.

'We need a politician who will fight on that rather than fight about the past or fight over what is fair and what is not fair. The Labour party has got to offer more than that.’

In a further blow to Ed Miliband, Tony Blair yesterday backed the Coalition’s ‘free schools’ initiative, describing it as ‘a great idea’.

The developments threatened to undermine Mr Miliband’s bid today to relaunch Labour as a credible economic force.

In a speech in Birmingham the Labour leader will accuse the Coalition of condemning Britain to a ‘lost decade of low growth’.

Mr Miliband will attack the Government’s economic strategy saying the country cannot afford ‘more of the same’.

But in a speech to a CBI gathering of businessmen in London this week, Lord Mandelson urged the Labour leadership to move on, and start setting out a positive alternative for the economy.

‘The whole argument about whether we’re cutting too far and too fast - it’s in the past.

‘It is rather predictable party political stuff from over the dispatch box, and it is a bit tiring to the public.

‘Everyone knows we are in a heck of a bad way in the economy. Quite a lot more pain is going to be experienced. What we should be saying is, “This is the light at the end of the tunnel. This is where we should be heading.”

‘We need to focus on how to redevelop our economy rather than fight about the past and fight about what’s too far and what’s far enough.’

Just bust: The former Business Secretary, right, also took a swipe at ex-Labour leader Gordon Brown, left, saying that the party may have abolished the boom, but not the bust

In a swipe at Mr Brown’s economic record, Lord Mandelson said: ‘I can’t remember who the member of the government was who claimed we abolished boom and bust. Well, we abolished boom.’

Labour’s economic policy under Mr Balls has focused almost entirely on opposition to the Government’s programme of cuts, with the Shadow Chancellor repeatedly calling for higher spending and borrowing.

Labour has opposed every cut to the bloated welfare budget and has yet to set out the economic policies on which it will fight the next election.

Polls conducted after the Budget this week suggested almost a third of people most trusted the Tories to handle the UK’s economic situation compared to just a quarter for Labour.

Changing sides: Former Labour leader and Prime Minister Tony Blair, pictured Wednesday, backed the Government's plan on free schools, something which new party leader Ed Miliband, right,  opposes

The Tories seized on the disarray in Labour’s ranks. Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Even Labour’s former Business Secretary - a man who knows how to win elections - thinks Ed Balls is living in “the past”.

‘Labour have opposed every single saving this Government is making to deal with the deficit, and are simply offering more of the same spending, borrowing and debt that got us into this mess in the first place.’

In a separate intervention, Mr Blair also gave fulsome backing to Michael Gove’s free schools initiative, which Labour has bitterly opposed under Mr Miliband’s leadership.

Speaking at a conference in Dubai the former Prime Minister also suggested he was not opposed to greater private sector involvement in state education, but said Britain was ‘not ready’ for a debate on the issue.

He also accused the teaching unions of obstructing ‘necessary economic change’.
