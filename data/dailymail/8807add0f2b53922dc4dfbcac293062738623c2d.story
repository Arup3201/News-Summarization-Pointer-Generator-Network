A man has been jailed after his Jack Russell dog Scrappy terrorised neighbours - in a place called Mutley.

Leslie Hodgson, 48, from Plymouth, Devon, allowed the small dog to bite several of his neighbours as well as allowing the dog to attack two police officers.  

Despite its size the dog, named after  Scooby Doo's little sidekick, already had a fearsome reputation in the Mutley area of Plymouth.

During the latest incident Hodgson made no attempt to control the dog and left his door wide open as he drank inside his flat on May 28, Plymouth Magistrates' Court heard.

The Jack Russell raced outside and started barking and snarling at a teenage neighbour and his sister.

As the 16-year-old shielded his sibling, Scrappy dug his teeth into the teenager's ankle, tearing through his jeans and leaving him with a bloody wound.

The court heard heard the boy was eventually able to shake the dog off and was taken to hospital where he had a tetanus jab.

Hodgson admitted being the owner of a dog which injured someone while dangerously out of control in public.

But his jail sentence was reduced from six months to three because of his guilty plea. The court ordered Scrappy to be destroyed.

A statement read out from a Devon and Cornwall Police officer said: 'Serious injury could be caused to other members of the public and young children.

'The dog is relatively small in size but has shown it is able to cause injury and I consider the dog to be a danger to the public.'

The court heard the dog had already bitten another man and two police officers in previous incidents.

Hodgson had received received a visit from Plymouth City Council’s dog warden and his neighbours had demanded the dog’s destruction.

The teenage victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had said previously: 'I was just trying to protect my sister.

'I love my family and I would do anything for them. It was quite painful and it is painful still.'

Jodi Barker, defending, said on one occasion when the dog got loose Hodgson had collapsed due to illness and was unable to stop it. 

She said: 'He is really fond of this animal and he is his reason for going out. He feels the dog’s behaviour has been a direct result of his actions and the dog is not a danger.

'He feels bad about the dog being destroyed as a result of his ability to not care for it properly.'

District judge Kevin Gray said: 'This was a situation where a dog had clearly bitten people before. It was not under any form of control. A young person was given hospital treatment.

'Given what I have heard about the dog and your ability to look after it, I will issue a destruction order.' 

It’s against the law to let a dog be dangerously out of control anywhere including the owner's house, a private garden or in public. 

A dog is classed as being dangerously out of control if it either injures somebody or causes them fear that they may be injured. 

All types of dogs - even if they are not banned - are covered by the law. 

Upon prosecution, owners can be fined up to £5,000 and sent to prison for up to six months. 

Owners can be banned from owning dogs in future and in many cases the animal can be destroyed. 

In more serious cases, where a dog injures somebody, an owner can be sent to prison for five years. 

If an owner deliberately sets their dog on somebody they can be charged with 'malicious wounding'. 

Killing someone with your dog can attract a 14-year jail term and an unlimited fine. 

Allowing a dog to attack a guide dog is punishable by up to three years in prison and a fine.
