The future of the British film industry is under threat because a council is refusing to allow the country's largest studios to expand. 

Pinewood Studios wants to double the size of its site to attract Hollywood's biggest names to film in the UK.

The studios, home to more than 1,500 movies over 77 years, were used to film the latest James Bond instalment, Skyfall, as well as the Oscar-nominated hit Les Miserables.

But South Bucks District Council has refused the application because it believes the development would 'cause significant degradation to the local environment' and harm 'the quality of life for local residents'. 

Marvel has already pulled out from filming its next movie Ant-Man. Disney is also looking elsewhere.

It is feared the Hollywood-big hitters will instead chose to shoot on locations in Germany and Eastern Europe.

In a letter to the Planning Inspectorate, the vice-president of Marvel wrote: 'Given a choice we would produce more films in the UK, (but) we will need additional facilities.

'If these facilities are not exist we will go elsewhere.'

Pinewood says if it does not expand there will be 'economic and cultural consequences for the UK'. 

But Dominic Grieve, the Attorney-General and local Tory MP, said he had 'considerable misgivings' about the application. 

Despite this, Boris Johnson, the Conservative mayor of London, has given his backing to the plans.

According to The Times, he said: 'If we get it right we could soon be seeing a golden age of film and TV production.' 

British directors who have made films at the studios include David Lean and Alfred Hitchcock

Since it opened in 1936, stars including Charlie Chaplin to Daniel Craig has passed through the gates.

Its high standards of production has attracted many Hollywood blockbusters such as Lara Croft: Tomb Raider movies starring Angelina Jolie.

It is probably best known for the Bond movies and Carry On series.
