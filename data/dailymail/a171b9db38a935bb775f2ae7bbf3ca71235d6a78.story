This is the heart-warming moment two Little Owls seem to kiss each other as they share dinner while perched on a country gate.

While it appears that these love birds are giving each other a peck, this is actually a mother feeding her youngster.

The adorable couple were captured on camera after they turned the head of photographer Ian Schofield, 35, in Droitwich, Worcestershire.

He said: 'The mother was bringing back the owlet food she'd just caught. But it really does look like they're kissing, even though it's just the young being fed.'

Little Owls are a species indigenous to the UK and can been found throughout much of England and Wales and even up into the Scottish borders.

There are around 5,700 breeding pairs in Britain with mating season taking place in the Spring, with clusters of between three and five eggs laid in May and incubated for 28 days before hatching.

Tasty: The species hunt first thing in the morning and at dusk, looking for mice, insects and beetles

Because of the Little Owl's small size, it is not uncommon for mother and baby to appear very similar, though the younger owl has lighter, fluffier feathers.

Little Owls are one of the most commonly spotted in the UK because they like to perch on fence posts, telegraph poles and at the tops of trees, making them very visible.

You have most chance of seeing one either first thing in the morning, or at dusk, as they make their way out to hunt for mice, insects, and beetles.

While in these pictures it is the mother taking on parental duties, feeding the young is actually shared out between both male and female parents.
