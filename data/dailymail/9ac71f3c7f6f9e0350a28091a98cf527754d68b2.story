An Indianapolis police officer has been removed from a two-decade-old cold case after using a crowdsourcing website to raise funds for a DNA test that might help solve the homicide.

Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department Detective Sgt. Bill Carter, who works in nuisance and abatement, has spent his own time since 2013 working to solve the 1993 homicide of 19-year-old Carmen Van Huss. 

The woman was raped and stabbed to death in her apartment on the city's north side on March 23, 1993, and two days later her body was found by her father.

Carter set up a GoFundMe page on Tuesday to raise money for a $996 DNA test that would give insight into the killer's genetic profile after it was announced the fee wouldn't be covered by grant funds.

 Carmen Van Huss, 19, was raped and stabbed to death in her studio apartment on March 23, 1993. Her killer has yet to be found

Though the city had originally paid for a different DNA test that cost $1,600, the Utah crime lab that processed the test returned the wrong DNA to Carter. 

So when he asked for funds for a second test that cost $996, he was denied and decided to crowdsource.

The refusal to fund sparked a debate between the Van Huss family, who were disappointed with the lack of funding, and Maj. Chris Bailey, IMPD's assistant criminal investigations commander, who said the DNA test is not always helpful. 

After 32 people donated to the cause in two days, Carter had more than $1,200. He told IndyStar that he wants the excess money to be donated to Crimestoppers. 

When Carter couldn't get funding for a DNA test that might help narrow down the genetic makeup of the killer of Van Huss, he set up a crowdfunding site to raise money. He raised $1,200 in two days

But just hours after IndyStar published an article about the crowdfunding site, IMPD pulled Carter from the cold case. 

Bailey said, however, that the fundraising had nothing to do with Carter's removal and that he was taken of the case after a review of assignments and procedures. 

Van Huss family members are devastated that Carter has been taken off Carmen's (pictured) case. They believe without him, it will not be solved

'We just want to make sure people stay in their lanes,' he told IndyStar. 'We have cold case investigators and we want to let them do their job.' 

Though Carter is not a cold case investigator, in 2011 he helped in the investigation of the 1989 death of a 16-year-old who was killed by a burglar in 1989. 

A year later he found the killer by matching a bloody palm print left at the scene with prints form an old misdemeanor arrest.

Bailey said that without Carter investigating the Van Huss homicide, he is unsure if the DNA test will be authorized.

Van Huss family members believe that without Carter on the case, it will never be solved, according to ABC 6. 

'This is insane. Something has to be changed if this is how the police department is going to be run,' Jimmy Van Huss, who was 15 when his sister was killed, told ABC.

He went on to tell IndyStar that Carter was the police officer that gave the family hope that the 22-year-old case would be solved. 

'Ever since Bill Carter took over, we had some hope. You balance between not getting your hopes up and having hope, and he gave hope,' he said. 'If he's not assigned to the case, I have zero hope that it'll be solved, zero.' 

Carter said that there is no guarantee that the test would confirm the suspect's identity, but that it would 'narrow the scope down' to who they're looking for. 

Bailey told the IndyStar that the police department wants justice for the family, but they 'want to follow strict and tight processes'.
