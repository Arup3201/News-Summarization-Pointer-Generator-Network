A friendly greeter at a Costco in northern California who has been diagnosed with terminal cancer was rewarded by his customers for his warm smile with money for a vacation.

Arlie Smith, 45, has worked at the big box store in Danville for more than 21 years, and is known for drawing smiles and flowers on receipts for customers' children.

He was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, a disease his mother also had, two years ago and in September doctors said that he had kidney cancer that spread to his bones.

He is estimated to have less than three years left to live.

Roughly two dozen customers surprised Danville Costco greeter Arlie Smith (right) 45, with a beach vacation after he was diagnosed with terminal cancer last year

Customers of the store, calling themselves Arlie's Angels, raised $2,500 so their favorite employee could go on a four-night vacation with his wife Shari to a resort in Laguna Beach, California.

Organized by customer Bridgette Loughnane, a group of about two dozen surprised Mr Smith at work on Tuesday, and came along with his wife and local news stations.

The package, which the Angels had been planning since October, also had sunscreen, a picture frame, seashells and a heartfelt note from customers.

'Everything that's done for me and the love that's shown for me, every day, it's astounding,' he told KTVU.

The grateful greater said that he appreciates the support from customers with whom he always tries to make real connections.

However, his real goal is to become the number one fundraiser for Children's Hospital Oakland during a drive in May.

The popular greeter was diagnosed with cancer last fall and began chemotherapy in November (right) but says that his main goal is to raise money for Children's Hospital in Oakland through a fundraising drive in May

He has asked well-wishers to help him raise money for the Children's Miracle Network charity, for which he had previously been a top 10 fundraiser in North America.

Mrs Smith, who met her future husband when she paid at his cashier's register in 2002, says her husband deserves all of the good attention he has gotten.

He says he's strengthened by those around him, especially his wife. 

'I have had 13 years of happiness with her. That's more than some children have had in their whole lives,' Mr Smith told Danville San Ramon, comparing his life to those of kids diagnosed deadly diseases.

The greeter also added that his customers are 'the reason I stand up tall at work every day'.
