The winter weather that is battering much of the country left a women's college basketball team stranded on the sidelines - of the Alabama interstate.

Players from the Middle Georgia State College women's basketball team were traveling by bus from Macon, Georgia, to their game against Martin Methodist College in Pulaski, Tennessee, yesterday. 

Icy conditions brought traffic to a standstill on Interstate 65 near Huntsville Browns Ferry Road in Athens, Alabama, and the bus driver decided it wasn't safe enough to continue.

Officers from Athens Police Department brought the Middle Georgia State College women's basketball team to their hotel last night after the team got stranded on Interstate 65 near Huntsville Browns Ferry Road in  Alabama

Things were so backed up last night on Interstate 65 (pictured), the team tried to walk three miles to their hotel 

Northbound traffic on Interstate 65 was still bumper to bumper today, but the team did make it to the game

Instead of waiting around for things to improve, the Knights decided to start walking to their hotel three miles away.

The team had already gone more than two miles when officers from the Athens Police Department found the Knights shortly after midnight and drove them the rest of the way to the Hampton Inn.

Middle Georgia State's game with Martin Methodist was scheduled for 2pm today.

Athens police chief Floyd Johnson said his officers would try to get the team back to its bus in time to get to the game if the road conditions improved. 

It initially looked like the Knights were't going to make it for tip-off, but they did arrive on time. 

The stress didn't help them as they were down by eight points to the RedHawks at halftime and trailed by double digits for most of the second half before eventually losing the game 62-52. 

Nina Mills scored 17 points for the winners during the contest.

After the game today was initially cancelled because of 'inclement weather' it actually began on time at 2pm
