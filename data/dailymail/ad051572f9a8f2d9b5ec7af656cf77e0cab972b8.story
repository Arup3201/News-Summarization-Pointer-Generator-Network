Under threat: An undated photo of businessman Neil Heywood who was murdered in November last year

A bodyguard who protected Neil Haywood during his affair with his alleged murderer Gu Kailai has spoken of how he fought off three Chinese assassins in an attempt on the old Harrovian’s life.

Michael Wright and his team were protecting the couple during the time they shared a flat in Bournemouth and revealed that the exposure of the affair led to a serious threat to Neil Heywood's life when three men tried to break into their home.

His interview comes the days after 
Gu Kailai appeared in court in China accused of killing Neil Heywood after he made a threatening 
demand for £13million from her playboy son.

Mr Wright said the team were surprised
 by three Chinese henchmen under orders to kill Mr Heywood after a spy, 
posing as a cook, has exposed the affair in 2001.

He said the three men attempted to break into the flat using martial arts.

‘They didn’t speak any English but 
they wanted to get upstairs to the flat where Neil and Mrs Gu was 
hiding,’ Mr Wright told The Mirror.

‘They were under orders to kill 
someone and it was my job to stop them. I was confronted by one of the 
guys at the front and wrestled him to the ground to restrain him.’

‘It was brutal. Those guys wanted 
blood. Eventually we got the better of them and they didn’t want the 
British police turning up so they jumped in a car and sped off.’

The attempt on his life terrified Neil Heywood and Mrs Gu was ‘shaking like a leaf’.

Mr Wright also revealed that despite the 
attempt on his life Mr Haywood and Mrs Gu became increasingly relaxed 
about their affair and would enjoy romantic dates at local restaurants calling 
themselves Neil and Gu Horus for protection.

Mr Wright described Neil Heywood as a 
nervous ‘old English colonial’ in linen suits who would chain-smoke at 
least three packs a day.

Gu Kailai has admitted to Chinese police in a pre-trial interview that she lured her former lover to a hotel room where she got him drunk and then laced his drink with cyanide.

Facing trial: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court

No contest: Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison

The
 alleged motive behind 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s grisly death was 
revealed at the murder trial of Mrs Gu, dubbed the Jackie Kennedy of China.

Her lawyer even argued that affable Mr Heywood, a father of two young 
children, ‘should bear some responsibility’ for his own murder.

Mrs Gu appeared in court on Wednesday alongside her co-accused – family
 bodyguard Zhang Xiajun, 33, who is alleged to have prepared the poison –
 where they both entered pleas but they did not contest the murder charge against them.

The court heard the Jaguar-driving 
Englishman had fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ with Mrs Gu’s party-loving 
son Bo Guagua, 24, whom Mr Heywood had once mentored to secure a place 
at his alma mater, Harrow School.

Mr Bo, known for a love of champagne 
and shisha parties while studying at Oxford University, was allegedly 
told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be 
destroyed,’ the judges heard, according to a reliable source who was in 
the courtroom.

Political scandal: Gu Zailai, left, with her husband - former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai. The murder case is one of China's biggest political scandals

These threats, in an email or letter, were said to have been forwarded by Bo to his mother.

International media were banned from 
the highly-politicised trial, which concluded in less than seven hours 
in the Intermediate People’s Court in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei.

The source added that the court heard it was not the first 
assassination plot on Mr Heywood, with Mrs Gu having previously conspired to
 kill him with a local police chief.

Implicated: The official allegation against Gu suggests Heywood might have been making threats against her son Bo Guagua, 24

The court’s deputy director Tang Yigan
 announced: ‘Gu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the 
personal safety  of her son Bo and decided to kill him.’

Gu summoned him to Chongqing, the 
mega-city in southwestern China where her husband was Communist Party 
Secretary, on November 13 last year.

They drank tea and wine together in
 room 1605 of the ‘Lucky Holiday Hotel’, before Mr Heywood became drunk
 and was sick.

After he had vomited, Gu, 53, helped 
him drink a glass of water – which she had mixed with a lethal draft of 
potassium cyanide.

A
 student who was allowed to witness the case said Gu had appeared 
‘calm’, despite the possibility she could be sentenced to death.

‘There 
were no tears. Both looked quite calm, peaceful. Both said they accepted
 the court’s authority,’ said the student.

Mr Tang said prosecutors 
believed the facts of the ‘brutal’ crime were clear and backed by ‘ample
 evidence’, and that ‘Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the 
accomplice’.

Gu had reportedly made a full 
confession to police, which it was in her interests to do because it 
will act in her favour during sentencing deliberations.

The judges 
reserved their verdict to an unspecified date within the next 30 days

She will almost certainly be found 
guilty, but could be spared the executioner’s bullet because of her 
defence that she was only trying to protect her son.

In a bid to further
 lighten her sentence, Gu was said to have made accusations about ‘other
 people’s crimes’, although no details were given.
