With rooms costing up to £5,300 a night, they are not the sort of hotels where you'd expect to find many Ford Fiestas in the guests' car park.

And these images show some of the astonishing vehicles parked outside the five-star Dorchester and Wellesley hotels in Mayfair, central London.

Among the manufacturers of the impressive cars on display were Lamborghini, Ferrari, Rolls-Royce, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Bentley.

And many numberplates were foreign - with Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait represented on a Lamborghini, Ferrari and Rolls Royce respectively.

The specific cars models on display included a green 217mph Lamborghini Aventador worth £295,000 and a blue 202mph Ferrari 458 worth £200,000.

Gary Tolson, sales manager at luxury car dealer Tom Hartley, based in Overseal, Derbyshire, identified all the cars pictured for MailOnline.

He said: ‘There are loads of UK supercars all over the place, but around the hotels you tend to get the rich Arabs who fly them in for holidays.

‘The market for us is always ongoing, there's always people who want to buy luxury cars - it's always manic for us, both buying and selling.'

The Dorchester's most expensive room per night is the £5,315 Harlequin suite, while the top one at The Wellesley is the £895 Hyde Park View Suite.
