It was only when she got wedged in a turnstile on the way to watch her favourite team play that  football fanatic,Tegwen Morris realised she had to do something about her weight.

The 36-year-old from Caernarfon, Wales, used to weigh more than 26 stone but following the traumatic experience she decided to kick her unhealthy lifestyle once and for all.

She cut back on junk food and joined Slimming World and now she describes herself as 'a completely different person', tipping the scales at a healthy 11st 8lbs and slipping into size 12 clothes.

Manchester United supporter Tegwen used to weigh more than 26 stone but now weighs just over 11 stone after joining Slimming World and kicking her unhealthy eating habits

Since her transformation Tegwen now enjoys going to the gym four times a week and has taken up kick boxing, 
mountain walking and aqua aerobics.

She is also overjoyed that she can watch her beloved Manchester United once again, as her bulging waistline was making it difficult to access the stadium.

She said: 'I’d stopped going to the football 
because I couldn’t fit through the turnstiles and had to stop three 
times as I climbed the 176 steps to the seats.

A different person: Tegwen now enjoys an active lifestyle and came fifth in a Slimming World contest

'I burst into tears when I got weighed for the first time, I couldn’t believe how big I’d let myself get.'

In a bid to shed the pounds Tegwen stopped indulging in takeaways and started attended sessions at her local slimming club.

She added: 'Since then I’ve completely
 changed the way I eat. Foods I used to eat like fried food, fish and 
chips and ready meals no longer agree with me.

'I’ve gained a whole new life. I can do anything I want to.'

'It’s
 hard to believe people don’t recognise me but then again I’m a 
completely different person so I suppose that’s understandable!'

Tegwen, who works with people with learning difficulties for Anglesey County Council, came fifth in the Slimming World’s Greatest Loser 2012 competition last month and thanked the club for providing her with help and advice.
