Karl Rominger, 41, has been charged with stealing $535,135 of his clients' money, which he used to fund gambling trips at casinos

The former attorney for Penn state football coach Jerry Sandusky has been charged with stealing $535,135 of his clients' money, which he used to fund gambling trips at casinos and other personal interests.

Karl Rominger, 41, who represented Sandusky during his child-sex abuse trial, allegedly misappropriated funds from clients that include a car accident victim, the spouse of a divorced couple and the survivors of a woman's estate. 

Rominger apologized to the former clients he had 'wronged'. 

'I look forward to accepting the consequences and putting this behind me, while making restitution,' he said, according to PennLive.com. 

Cumberland County investigators filed 25 charges for theft and fund misappropriation on Friday. 

They said Rominger could still face more charges as the investigation is not yet complete. 

In his affidavit, chief detective Les Freehling wrote that Rominger's financial records were in such a state of 'disarray' that it had been hard to account for additional possible losses. 

Rominger came under investigation last year after he failed to materialize $147,883 from the sale of a marital home during a divorce case, Freehling said. 

It was then discovered that $800,000 in client money was missing from a bank account under the former attorney's control.

Rominger, who said he hasn't gambled since last March, voluntarily surrendered his law license and is currently free on $250,000 bail. 

District Attorney David Freed said there is still at least 'one other substantial situation' being investigated. 

He added that investigators have also yet to be given access to all of Rominger's files due to claims of attorney-client privilege.   

Rominger represented former Penn State football coach Jerry Sandusky during his child-sex abuse trial. The former attorney voluntarily surrendered his law license last spring
