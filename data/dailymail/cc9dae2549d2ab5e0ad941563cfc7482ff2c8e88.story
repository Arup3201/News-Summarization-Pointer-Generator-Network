She enjoyed a five year reign as France's first lady alongside husband Nicholas Sarkozy, the country's president from 2007 to 2012.

And now, following Sarkozy's defeat in the last General Election, Carla Bruni, 45, is slowly getting back to her previous life as a high-fashion model and acclaimed singer.

She stars in a stunning new campaign for Bulgari shot by Terry Richardson, her first since her husband left office.

Draped in luxurious high jewels Bruni 
radiates that sophisticated Italian-French beauty that brought her fame as a 
young model in the late 1980s.

Dressed elegantly and looking radiant, Carla displays her self-confidence and joie de vivre wearing a plethora of exquisite Bulgari haute jewels matched with watches, bags and eyewear.

The setting is the fascinating energy of the Eternal city, whether Carla is captured in different situations including shopping at the Bulgari Condotti store, sipping an espresso, attending a cocktail party at glitterati hot-spots and enjoying a glitzy after dark event with a breathtaking view on the rooftops of Rome.

She was spotted at age 19 Carla landed lucrative jobs with Chanel, Dior, Givenchy, Chanel and Yves Saint Laurent. She made her name and fortune as a model but enjoyed a 10-year break to channel her energy into her music career.

Now the camping for Bulgari marks her return. The model follows in the footsteps of Julianne Moore and Rachel Weisz who have both fronted the luxury brand in the past.

'It makes me very proud and very happy to have been chosen to represent the image of Bulgari for Haute Joaillerie,' says Bruni.

Bruni released her fourth album Little French Songs in April and now stars in this modelling campaign

'In a way, this fine jewelry house is 
already familiar to me. I feel connected with its romantic history and 
with its Italian soul which breathes life and joy and I sincerely hope 
to honor it.'

Citing her experience, Bruni hails the opportunity 
she has had to with the leading haute couture and haute joaillerie houses and 
to wear their creations. She details her adoration of jewels and their meaning.

'I have come to know the different crafts and 
gained an infinite appreciation for the master craftsmen, for their 
apprentices, for the seamstresses,' she says.

'Jewelry belongs to the world of feelings, it touches matters 
of the soul. It declares a passion, betokens love, carries a memory, 
symbolizes a belief, seals an engagement, awards an honor or protects from
misfortune.'

Carla was 
thrust back into the spotlight when then-French president Nicolas Sarkozy revealed they 
were dating in late 2011, just months after he had divorced his second wife.

The two married in February 2008, and Carla performed her role as first lady with utmost elegance.

She released her third album Comme Si 
De Rien N'Ã©tait in July of the same year.

She has left it an entire 
five years until the release of her fourth, Little French Songs, which 
came out in April.

While Carla admits she waited until 
her husband was no longer president to bring the album out, she also 
wanted to enjoy new motherhood, as she only gave birth to the couple's 
daughter Giulia in 2011.

In April 2009, Bruni established the 
Carla Bruni-Sarkozy Foundation, a plight to fight illiteracy and provide
educational support through tutoring and scholarship programs for 
underprivileged youngsters.

A rock star first lady, Carla dipped the odd toe in the music industry while her husband was in office, but only now is her fourth studio album Little French Songs finally out.

Her international hit Quelqu'un M'a Dit brought her fame in 2002 and set her firmly up as an acclaimed signer and musician, her

'It was a mix of circumstances,' says Bruni.

"I did wait until my husband was not the president of France anymore. But I also waited because I had a little girl, a baby girl, so I had really no choice... I did it piece by piece.

'I wrote the album, then I recorded the album in another time, then I released the album in another time - instead of doing it all at once like most songwriters do,' she confessed, speaking with NPR's Robert Siegel.

Little French Songs is Carla's fourth studio album - her first since leaving the post of first lady of France
