A day after pictures emerged of an autograph hunter allegedly assaulted by NBA star Scottie Pippen wearing a neck brace and strapped to a stretcher, details have emerged giving the basketball star's side of the fracas.

Former Chicago Bulls star Pippen was questioned on Monday over the fight that broke out between him and the man, who has not been named, outside Nobu in Malibu on Sunday.

Now claims have emerged that Pippen was the real victim in the ordeal and that the
fan started the tussle, spat on the ex-athlete and called 
him the N-word, all while Pippen was holding his 
4-year-old daughter.

Questions: Pippen pictured leaving a police station with his wife Larsa after being interviewed over the alleged altercation outside Nobu in Malibu on Sunday

'Row': The man is understood to have been taking pictures inside the sushi restaurant while Pippen was dining with his family on Sunday

'Can you imagine, you’re out to 
dinner with your wife, your four kids and your mother-in-law, and 
someone calls you the N-word and starts to get physical?' a source speaking on behalf of Pippen told the New York Daily News.

Pippen is reportedly considering a counter claim against the 
autograph-seeker for assault and making a false police report, the 
source said.

Several witnesses described the fan as intoxicated, said sheriff’s spokesman Steve Whitmore.

'When Scottie left, this guy had no injuries,' said the source. 'Scottie is very upset about the way this has been portrayed.'

Treatment: Pippen voluntarily attended a police station to answer questions the day after the incident

Injuries: The man was wearing a neck brace and was strapped to the stretcher as he was loaded into an ambulance outside the restaurant

The man, who was reportedly taking 
pictures inside the sushi restaurant on Sunday while Pippen dined with 
his family, was pictured being loaded into an ambulance on the 
stretcher.

Pippen, 47, attended a police station
voluntarily after he was named as a suspect in an investigation of an 
assault with intent to commit great bodily injury, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's officials said.

He was at the police station for about an hour and released pending further investigation.

Police spokesperson Whitmore told the LA Times that the incident was 'a more complex situation' and needed further investigation before any arrests were made.

Scene: The drama unfolded at Nobu after Pippen left the restaurant and went outside to the parking lot

The drama unfolded after Pippen left the restaurant and went outside to the parking lot. The man continued to take pictures and sought the Hall-of-Famer's autograph.

An argument erupted that led to the altercation. The man was taken to hospital with a head injury and was treated and released. He was pictured being put into the back of an ambulance wearing a neck brace.

Investigators were interviewing several witnesses who apparently saw the incident.

'Right now it's under investigation,' Whitmore said. 'We have to interview everybody to find out what happened.'

Investigations: A detective in an unmarked police car was photographed outside the restaurant - a favourite of the many celebrities living in the area - in the wake of the incident

Luxury: The sushi restaurant Nobu in Malubi has stunning views of the California coast

Nobu has been a Malibu mainstay for nearly 15 years and is frequented by celebrities including Leanne Rimes, Halle Berry and Gerard Butler.

The restaurant recently moved to a beachfront location that offers views of the Pacific Ocean from nearly every seat.

Inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, Pippen won six NBA titles with Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls and was on a list of the league's 50 greatest players announced in 1996.

He is a special adviser to the team's president and chief operating officer. The Bulls declined to comment on Monday.
