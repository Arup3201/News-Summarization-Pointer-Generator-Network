School can be a daunting place for children with autism – with many struggling to communicate with peers and stay focussed.

But one school think they have found a solution – robot teachers.

Topcliffe Primary in Birmingham is the first in the country to use humanoid robots to help teach pupils with autism.

Topcliffe School in Castle Vale, Birmingham, West Midlands has become the first school in the UK to use a robot to teach autistic children. Pictured are pupils Corbin Chow (left), five, and Libi Cooper (right), five, taking the £15,000 robot named 'Max' for a walk

The knee-high machines, which are designed to move in the same way as children, can be programmed to have conversations, play games, dance and even take classes.

But unlike human teachers, Max and Ben – so named by the pupils – have blank features, no emotions and standardised expressions and responses.

It is this, according to head teacher, Ian Lowe that makes the robots much easier for autistic to children to relate to and understand.

‘Autistic children find them less threatening and easier to engage with than adults and other children, so they provide a safe environment for them to explore and develop their communication skills,’ he said.

‘Children who first come into school unable to make eye contact with humans start to communicate through the robots.

‘They are also cute and lovable which helps capture their attention,’ he added.

The mainstream state school, which caters for children without autism, has a centre dedicated to those with the disability – the long-term aim being to get them to integrate into classes with other children.

Many autistic children have successfully been able to do so, thanks in part to the way the school has taken on such technology, according to Mr Lowe.

He said several schools have been in touch who are considering investing in the technology themselves.

Before Libi Cooper (pictured above) met Ben the robot, she struggled to maintain focus in lessons for more than ten minutes.

But after a school year of weekly or twice weekly lessons with him, the five-year-old can now concentrate for a 20 minute session and her social skills have dramatically improved.

Her teacher Richard Garland says her ability to communicate with others has seen a noticeable improvement, as has her vocabulary. 

‘She can look at the robot’s body language and work out if it is shocked or surprised, for example. A skill that’s transferable to real life,’ he said.

Mr Garland, who looks after a class of 6 autistic children, said: ‘It is lovely to see to see how she lights up with the robot. 

‘She loves giving it hugs and adores its dancing and when it does “head shoulders knees and toes” – mirroring the robot’s moves. She’s hypnotised.’

She’ll laugh along and copy it doing the Michael Jackson Thriller dance, he said, ‘and in the morning she’ll come in and pat it on the head, saying “Are you alright, Robot?”’

‘There’s a concentration and willingness to stay with the class that wasn’t there before. It really engages her and holds her attention for extended periods of time,’ he added.

Libi’s father, Colin, who also has an autistic son, Owen, seven, at the school, said: ‘She has picked up a lot from the robot. She’ll come back from school and tell us all about the games she’s been playing.

‘We have seen a vast improvement in Libi over the past six months.

‘It’s impossible to say how much this is down to the robot because the school has been doing a lot of good work, but I think it’s a big part of the jigsaw.’

Mr Cooper, a driving instructor, said his son is also transfixed by the robot who he calls ‘Buzz Lightyear.’

‘Owen thinks it’s like something out of Toy Story – a toy come to life,’ he said.

‘It has given him confidence and brought him out of his shell. 

‘My wife and I are blown away by what it can do and are very open-minded to the different technology that’s out there that can help our kids,’ he added.

Topcliffe volunteered itself two years ago to become something of a research laboratory for the University of Birmingham and Aldebaran, the creators of the robots.

Aldebaran donated the machines - which cost about £15,000 each to produce – to the school, in order to learn how their technology could help children with disabilities.

‘It has worked out to be very mutually beneficial,’ Mr Lowe said. ‘They gave us the robots and we report back.’

Teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer - allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it

He explained that the university are constantly developing new features based on suggestions from teachers about what would benefit the pupils.

For instance, teachers can communicate through the robot for an entire class by writing sentences into a computer – allowing the children to believe they are being taught by it.

A feature recently developed even allows teachers and parents to track a child’s progression by recording all of their results in games played with the robot and by tracking their responses.

The most popular educational game is ‘animal recognition’, where the robot asks a child to identify a card with a particular animal on.

'We've seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their "best friend" after initially being scared of it,' said Ben Waterworth, Head of ICT at the school

For example, the robot will say ‘Find me a cat’, and the pupil will have to go through a pack of cards then hold the correct one up to its face.

If they get it right, the robot will congratulate them and do a dance and if they don’t it will tell them ‘hard luck, you could do better’. 

The response is always exactly the same, to limit any confusion and to ‘build trust’, according to Head of ICT at the school, Ben Waterworth.

‘We’ve seen some lovely signs of progression in children who say the robot is their “best friend” after initially being scared of it,’ he said.

‘It helps their listening skills and mimicry, also helping them learn how to take it in turns and how to stay focussed - a stepping stone to interaction with people.

‘It is also useful in helping teachers control the class, getting them to listen and sit down for instance.’

Dr Karen Guldberg, director of the University of Birmingham’s Autism Centre for Education and Research, said: ‘To be effective in teaching children with autism, it is crucial to find ways to motivate and engage them.

‘It is also important to communicate clearly by using simple language and giving children plenty of time to take in instructions. 

‘The robot does all those things and has therefore been a very effective tool to support the children’s communication and interaction in the classroom.’

Dr Guldberg added that a well thought out programme could also work well in mainstream classes.‘If you can meet the needs of children autism you can meet the needs of all children,’ she said.

‘When people feel safe and are motivated they learn much better.’
