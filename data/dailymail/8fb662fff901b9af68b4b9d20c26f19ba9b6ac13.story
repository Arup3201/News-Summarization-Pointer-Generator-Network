The photographs showing David Cameron on the phone congratulating US President Barack Obama on winning a second term were supposed to highlight the two leaders’ growing friendship. 

But closer inspection shows the Prime Minister’s relationship with  Mr Obama is not as spontaneous as he might like us to think – it shows  a ‘restricted’ memo written by his aides advising him what to talk about with the President.

The memo, headed ‘call to Obama Thurs 14.55’ and addressed to Cabinet members as well as the foreign policy team, reminds  Mr Cameron to ask him about Congress, Iran, Syria and the global economy and to ‘put down a marker for a Washington visit in May’.

Daily routine: Mr Cameron's expensive coffee machine and trusty black shoe polish are visible in the back of the shot of him congratulating Barack Obama on winning a second term as U.S. president

The pictures also offer insight into Mr Cameron’s daily routine.

On
his desk there are six pencils and just one pen, a telling sign that Mr
Cameron is left-handed as pencils avoid the problem of smudged ink.

A
£160 Dolce Gusto Circolo coffee machine sits next to a picture of  wife
Samantha, and perched on a dado rail by Mr Cameron’s desk is a bottle 
of £6.19 Kiwi Premiere Shine Ultra Brilliant Shoe Polish – proof that 
despite Mr Cameron’s posh background he is not above shining his own 
shoes.

'Spontaneous': Upon closer inspection, the memo on the PM's desk was found to include advice from aides on what to say to the President

Mr Cameron's framed photograph of his wife Samantha can be seen on the table behind him
