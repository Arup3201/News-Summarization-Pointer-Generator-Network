Per Mertesacker claimed Germany were being compared to a 'Mickey Mouse team' in an amazing TV outburst after their 2-1 victory over Algeria.

Germany were forced into extra-time, but set up a World Cup quarter-final against France in the Maracana after goal from Chelsea forward Andre Schurrle and Arsenal's Mesut Ozil.

Mertesacker told ZDF television: 'Would you rather we played beautiful football but got knocked out?

'I don't know what you want from me - do you think that just Mickey Mouse teams are involved in the last 16?

Schurrle
 admitted Germany had struggled in this second round clash and demanded 
improvements against France on Friday in Rio de Janeiro.

The Chelsea star said: 'It doesn't matter how we've done it, the main thing is we're in the quarter-finals.

'There was a bit of luck involved in my goal and now we've got to play better than this against France.'

Germany manager Joachim Low admitted his team had struggled against the highly-motivated Algeria side.

He
 said: 'Algeria was a fighting team. We know they are extra motivated 
and ready to work, and we know they have two very strong and fast 
strikers.'

Low
 hopes Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has been struggling with injury all 
season, will be fit to face Didier Deschamps' side on Friday.

The Bayern Munich midfielder was forced off with cramp in extra-time, but Low believes he will be fit to start in the Maracana.
