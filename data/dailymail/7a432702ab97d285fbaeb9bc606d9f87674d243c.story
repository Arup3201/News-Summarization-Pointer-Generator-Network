St Petersburg is only three-and-a-half hours by express train from the Russian capital, Moscow, but it could be a different country.

In a city of Italian, not Stalinist architects, it would be easy to forget you are in Russia.

Peter the Great, it is said, hated Moscow. And when he founded his modern capital at the mouth of the Neva River in 1703, he looked to the West for inspiration. In the course of the next 100 years, his court built the city's magnificent baroque and neo-classical palaces. 

Colours and shapes: St Petersburg boasts grand landmarks such as the Church of the Saviour on Spilled Blood

Today, visitors flock to the Peter and Paul Fortress, with its sombre Romanov tombs, the massive St Isaac's Cathedral and the Hermitage Museum, that treasure trove of European art (look out for its army of cats, introduced by Empress Elizabeth in 1745 to keep the resident rats at bay).

The Yusupov Palace should not be missed.

From 1710 to the Revolution, it was home to four generations of this colourful family. They included Nicholas, one of Catherine the Great's art buyers; Dimitri, a lover of Coco Chanel (the shape of the No.5 perfume bottle is said to be based on his hip flask); and Felix, who once gave the ballerina Anna Pavlova a silk dress studded with rubies and diamonds for her performance in Swan Lake.

It was the same Felix who fed Rasputin cookies laced with cyanide.

Art of the matter: The Hermitage - the former Winter Palace of the Tsars - is one of the world's great galleries

Above all, St Petersburg - built on 42 islands and spanned by hundreds of bridges — is best experienced on foot. Lewis Carroll noted on his visit there in 1867: 'I feel as if I could and should be content to do nothing for many days but roam about it.' Stroll along the pastel-coloured Neva Embankment as days lengthen into White Nights (where from around May to the end of July, it never gets darker than twilight), and watch the bridges open to allow ships through to the Baltic.

Then, the city is rent in two, making access to the other side impossible - 'and providing a convenient excuse for errant husbands', my guide says wryly.

By day, enjoy vistas that inspired Pushkin ('I love thee, Peter's bold creation'). St Petersburg is undergoing a beautification process, with restorations and smart new apartments constructed behind old facades.

It boasts the fabulous Mariinsky II opera house, a new concert hall, Russia's largest privately-owned contemporary art museum and, in the 19th century General Staff Building, a natty new wing for the Hermitage.

An imperial wonder: The decor and fittings within the Hermitage are as impressive as the art on its wide walls

Meanwhile, Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovich has bought Peter the Great's historic navy warehouses on New Holland island and, with girlfriend Dasha Zhukova, plans to restore them for use as a multi-purpose cultural complex, slated for completion in 2018.

On the bling front, St Petersburg remains some way behind Moscow. But that, too, is being addressed. Designer shops fill the former market of Gostiny Dvor, and expensively elegant department stores, such as the new DLT, tempt the average citizen with goods he or she couldn't possibly afford.

Meanwhile, hip restaurants and bars with names such as Meat Head, Mansarda, Berlin Season and Tao are mushrooming in lofts and the old court stables area - our own Jamie Oliver was one of the first foreign celebrity chefs to make his mark in the city with his Italian-themed eatery.

This is where you can find the fabled New Russians, elegantly draped and heeled, their Porsches double-parked outside.

Snowy splendour: The city's buildings - such as the Alexander Nevsky Monastery - look even grander in winter

How different from my first visit, in the bad ol' days of Communism. In the Eighties, I was billeted in the dour Leningrad Hilton. Today, visitors can enjoy quasi-imperial opulence.

Belmond (Orient Express) has taken over the Grand Hotel Europe and created a magnificent Heritage wing; and Rocco Forte has given the Astoria (where Hitler had planned, somewhat prematurely, to hold his victory dinner) a facelift.

Driving along the Neva, I passed what looked like a 19th-century warehouse, romantically lit by moonlight. Sated by so much grandeur, I thought it would make an industrial-chic alternative to the lavish hotel scene.

'That?' said my guide, incredulously. 'It is the oldest-serving prison in Russia!' Such is the charm of St Petersburg that even its prison exerts a certain allure. From the outside, at least.
