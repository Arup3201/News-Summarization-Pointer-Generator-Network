Arsene Wenger has hit back at criticism of his team’s capitulation against Anderlecht in the Champions League, when they conceded three goals in the final 30 minutes to throw away a 3-0 lead.

Arsenal were booed off the pitch and several of their former players lambasted Wenger’s approach — prominent among them Paul Merson, who repeatedly labelled the tactics ‘clueless’. 

But Wenger, whose team take on Swansea on Sunday, made an impassioned defence of his commitment to attack — saying just because a team is 3-0 up, it is no reason to focus on defending.

Arsene Wenger cannot bear to watch as his Arsenal side give up a 3-0 lead at home to Anderlecht

Paul Merson, who played under Wenger briefly at Arsenal, described his old club's defending as 'clueless'

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had put the Gunners three goals up, and it seemed they would win comfortably

Wenger said: ‘You have to defend well and attack well. Why should you stop playing one of the aspects of the game?

'These debates that I hear are a joke, a farce. People who have managed zero games, they teach everybody how you should behave. It’s a farce. Honestly, I cannot even be upset about it.’

Merson was the foremost critic and he has in fact managed briefly, if unsuccessfully, at Walsall between 2004-06, but Wenger was cutting about his analysis.

‘Honestly, it does not matter to me. You say what you want. You are free. I managed him. I tried. I’m not interested in Paul Merson.’

Merson was an early casualty of Wenger’s reign when he was sold to Middlesbrough in 1997.
