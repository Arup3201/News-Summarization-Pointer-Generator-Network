Former England goalkeeper David James has been forced into auctioning signed shirts, shorts and match balls after being declared bankrupt in May.

James has built up crippling debts after breaking up with his wife Tanya in 2005 and is said to have blown his £20million fortune which came from his football wages, endorsements and modelling contracts for companies such as Armani.

The 44-year-old played in the Premier League for teams such as Liverpool, Manchester City and Portsmouth and has recently came out of retirement to become a player-manager at Indian Super League side Kerala Blasters.

Until the revelations, no-one inside the James circle was aware of the desperate financial situation that forced him to Hertford County Court.

The former England keeper has written a regular column for The Observer and has always donated his fee to charity. He also owned a house in Dubai at the time of a credit crisis, which was part of his seven-strong property portfolio.

He has also worked as a pundit for BT Sport. 

James split up with his wife to rekindle a relationship with childhood sweetheart Amanda Salmon, and they have been together for nearly a decade. He was forced to pay Tanya £3m as part of the divorce settlement.

His PR team have refused to comment about the bankruptcy. 

James has decided to sell around 150 items of signed merchandise through Kent-based auctioneer Hilco. 

A 1998/1999 multicoloured Port Vale FC goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington -  (left) and a signed Frank Lampard shirt is also available to buy

James will auction the pink goalkeeper strip he had previously worn against Chelsea in the 2010 FA Cup final and the yellow England jersey he wore against Germany at the 2010 World Cup 

He is also selling a Technics SL-1200 Turntable - this series of music player is no longer manufactured

A petrol driven chainsaw is also up for grabs as James auctions off many of his possessions

The public will be able to bid for items, which range from football memorabilia to DJ equipment and toys, from November 6 to 18.

A signed Frank Lampard shirt, a bright pink Portsmouth goalkeeper top, a Malawi shirt and a NFL jersey are among the 150 items. 

James has even put up for auction shirts worn by Chelsea's Petr Cech in the 2010 FA Cup final against Portsmouth, a Holland jersey he  swapped with Edwin van der Sar and a Michael Owen No 10 kit with 'best wishes' penned across it.

A 1998-1999 multi-coloured Port Vale goalkeeper shirt - which he would have swapped with former Manchester United trainee Kevin Pilkington - is also available to buy.

You can also get your hands on non-football items such as a Technics turntable (which is no longer manufactured), three bicycles and even a a Jubilee plastic half-mug piece. 

And, if you fancy it, a petrol driven chainsaw.

He is still listed as being part of BT Sport's media team - despite signing up for the 10-week long Indian Super League along with fellow former Premier League stars such as Robert Pires, Freddie Ljungberg and Nicolas Anelka. 

James, who made 53 appearances for England between 1997 and 2010, won two major honours during his spell in England - the 1995 League Cup with Liverpool and the 2008 FA Cup with Portsmouth before moving to Iceland to join IBV.

Former team-mate Stan Collymore, who played with James at Liverpool, said the goalkeeper had a tendency to throw away his money as if he'd be earning it forever.

Collymore said in his 2004 autobiography: 'If he had a new car and he pranged it, he would just go and buy a new car.

'If he bought a new pair of shoes and he scuffed them, he wouldn't clean them. He would just chuck them in the spare room and buy a new pair. 

'Too much disposable income, I suppose. Too easy just to bin stuff. Too easy to spend money like you're going to be earning that kind of money for the rest of your life.' 

One item not included in the auction is the infamous white - or cream, depending on who you ask - suit worn by James and his Liverpool team-mates on the Wembley pitch before the 1996 FA Cup final. 

They came to sum up Liverpool's 'Spice Boys' and James lamented that the suits became more memorable than the match itself, which was won 1-0 by opponents Manchester United.

The Armani suits were the goalkeeper's choice as he was modelling with the firm at the time. 

His former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Fowler told the Independent in 2008: 'It was David James's idea.

'At the time, he was an Armani model. If we had won, nobody would have mentioned it. But we lost and it has become infamous. People remind me about them all the time.'

We can only wonder what the suit might fetch were it included in the auction.
