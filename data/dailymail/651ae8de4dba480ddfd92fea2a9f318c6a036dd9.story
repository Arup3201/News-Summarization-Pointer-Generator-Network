A pink-nosed cub taking her first steps outside decided she couldn't bear the cold and quickly began bawling for her mother.

The eight-week-old cub was only out of the den in Stewart Crossing, Yukon, Canada, for a few moments before the cold overcame her curiosity and she began to yawn and cry. 

The baby bear's mother let the racket continue for about 45 minutes because she was 'waiting for the young one to cry itself to sleep'. according to photographer Peter Mather.

Tough love: The cub's mother let the little bear cry for about 45 minutes before they went back into their den

Staring contest: The cub tried getting past her mother and into the den, but the older bear was having none of it

The 39-year-old and his partner spotted the pair of bears and photographed them from about 50 feet away from the safety of their vehicle.

He said: 'We pulled over to watch this bear, when a little cub crawled out after the sow [female black bear].

'It was an incredibly unusual situation.

'The bears had been denning in a road culvert and were just emerging.' 

Mr Mather added: 'The little cub was curious at first, but quickly got tuckered out and started bawling - screaming at the top of its lungs.

'The mother was really tired, and did not have any interest in us. 

'She was just patiently waiting for the cub to cry herself to sleep.'

'It reminded us exactly of a human mum with a newborn,' Mr Mather continued. 

'The mum being so tired and slumped over, waiting for the young one to cry itself to sleep.

'Eventually the cub got tired after about 45 minutes, and crawled back into the den. The mum quickly followed and they went to sleep.

'We waited for about five hours to see if they would emerge, but they were fast asleep. When darkness came, we moved on.'
