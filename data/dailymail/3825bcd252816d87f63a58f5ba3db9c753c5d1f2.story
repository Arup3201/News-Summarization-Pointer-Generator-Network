Zinedine Zidane's eldest son, Enzo, made his debut for Real Madrid's B side during their 2-1 victory at home to Conquense on Sunday - with his father helping lead the team from the touchline.

Real Castilla assistant boss Zidane sent his progeny on with just two minutes left of the match on Sunday.

The 19-year-old midfielder failed to score in his extremely short cameo appearance but is expected to become more involved with first-team affairs at the Segunda B - or Spanish third division - side in the coming weeks.

Despite only being on the pitch for a matter of minutes, Enzo managed to pull off an impressive 'roulette' trick.

Unsurprisingly, Enzo has been courted by both France and Spain as they look to secure him for their national set-ups.

Having already played for the Spanish Under 15 side, the young midfielder was called to France to undertake medical tests with their Under 19 team and has since decided to represent the country of his birth.

He was named after Enzo Francescoli, who made 73 appearances for Uruguay and scored 17 goals, as well as playing for French side Marseille.

The youngster, who has elected to play for the France Under-19 side, came on in the 88th minute

Zidane's two younger sons, Theo and Eliza, are also being groomed by Real Madrid's academy and their father hopes they will make it into the squad in the future too.

Enzo is renowned for his trickery and below is a Vine showing him performing outrageous skills during the Real youth side's match with Sevilla in June.

Zidane Snr has been reported by the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre for his lack of coaching badges - but he is now registered as the assistant coach to Santiago Sanchez having first been named as the manager.

However, Miguel Galan, who reported him, claims Zidane is very much the man in charge.
