'The Reverend': Fake vicar George Gordon faces jail after he stole up to
£30,000 from a charity for victims of depression, sexual abuse and 
mental disorders

A man, who falsely claimed he was a vicar, stole up to £30,000 in charity funds after buying a clerical title online.

'Clever trickster' George Gordon, 51, faces jail after he siphoned off European grant funding for voluntary groups set up to help some of the most vulnerable people in Britain.

Calling himself ‘The Reverend,’ Gordon falsely claimed to be a Cambridge-educated Church of England clergyman and also won widespread sympathy by allegedly pretending to suffer from cancer and manic depression.  

When his scam was uncovered by police, he went on the run for up to three years until he was tracked down following a nationwide appeal.

After obtaining the clerical title from a Canadian website, Gordon got a job in charge of a charity fund which gave money to victims of depressions, sexual abuse and mental disorders.

It has since emerged that Gordon had been repeatedly jailed for fraud in the past including a stretch in the 1990s after he posed as a priest to steal £21,000 in charity cash intended for handicapped children and young sex abuse victims.

At Liverpool Crown Court, Gordon, from Toxteth, Liverpool pleaded guilty to nine counts of obtaining money by deception and 11 counts of fraud. Six other charges were left to lie on the file. He is due to be sentenced later this month.

Gordon had been previously described as the judge as a ‘clever and fraudulent confidence trickster’.

Turning down an application for bail, Judge Stephen Everett remanded Gordon in custody and told him: ‘You are a professional conman and time has finally caught up with you.

‘This was an overwhelming case against you and the sentence is going to be a substantial one.’

According to the Liverpool Daily Post, Judge Everett also said: ‘He is a man who cannot be believed when he says certain things.

‘The
fact that he went missing for three years and the fact that he knows 
full well he’s going to get a long sentence says to me there is a 
substantial risk of him failing to surrender.’

Gordon
was jailed for three years in 1988 for theft and between 1993 and 1998 
he cheated various charitable trusts while posing as different 
clergymen, including two female vicars, and was jailed for a further 
four years.

But after he was released he landed a job on the Merseyside Disability Federation after being so convincing that no criminal record checks were carried out on his background.

People who came into contact with Gordon claim he pretended to suffer from manic depression to work his way into the Merseyside self-help branch of the Bipolar Organisation.

From here, he charmed his way into the Bipolar Organisation's MDF, a panel which met monthly to award grants to charities and community projects.

Gordon, who boasted about having degrees from Cambridge and University of Wales, gained the trust of vulnerable individuals, charities, panels and funding bodies and was able to forge signatures to siphon off the grants, destined for vital community projects.

Gordon also hired a base at the 3TC charity centre in Waterloo, Liverpool where it is alleged he conducted a fraud involving students with mental health problems.

He ran the scheme from August 2006 until December 2007, when the lease was terminated after rent arrears rose to nearly £36,000. After taking legal advice, the charity was told the chances of recovering the debt were minimal.

The Bipolar Organisation’s Merseyside branch was closed down when allegations about Gordon’s activity surfaced.

He was arrested in August 2008 but he vanished after being bailed and his name was circulated on a police wanted list. He was tracked down last year to an address in Durham.

In a recent interview, Ruth Dean, a bipolar sufferer tricked by Gordon, said that the convicted fraudster used bogus titles to defraud and exploit the vulnerable.

Mrs Dean said: ‘Members who sought support and solace in self-help groups were left to the mercy of George Gordon.

‘The Rev Dr is from a Canadian website. He has never, as he claims, held a ministry or been to Cambridge or Lampeter universities.

‘It is amazing how much carnage one individual can wreak. But what is really horrifying is that a man with an extensive criminal CV was allowed to sit on a panel awarding European Social Fund money.’

The charges against Gordon which spanned from November 2004 to 2007 allege he falsified documents on behalf of the Somewhere Else Mental Health Project, Healthcare Profession Support Network and Synergy Training Projects.

He is also said to have falsified signatures on contracts of Synergy Training Projects, Phoenix Survivors Group, Karonga Garden Project, Borderline Personality Disorder, University Disability Fellowship and Adlam Accessible Allotments.

Gordon was accused of obtaining money by deception from Manic Depression Fellowship of £10, 800, from Blue Skies Project of £8,700 on various dates plus another £950 and £5,000 from the Surviving Suicide Group.
