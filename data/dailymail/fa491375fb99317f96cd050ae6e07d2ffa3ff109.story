Crystal Palace are poised to win the battle to sign Brede Hangeland on Friday.

The towering 33-year-old was released by Fulham via email at the end of the season and has held talks with Hull City with Steve Bruce keen to add experience alongside Curtis Davies and new signing Harry Maguire.

However, Tony Pulis has managed to convinced the experienced Norwegian to stay in London and form a partnership with Scott Dann for next season.

Target: Former Fulham defender Brede Hangeland is on his way to Crystal Palace

Hangeland left Craven Cottage under a cloud after six-and-a-half years in west London.

He said he would have been willing to stay with Fulham in the Championship had he received assurances about the future direction of the club.
