A 75-year-old woman has been charged with the stabbing murder of her husband in their Adelaide home.

Police and paramedics were called to the Rawson Street home in Alberton, north east of Adelaide CBD, about 7.50am on Sunday, after reports of a stabbing.

The names of the couple have been reported as Antonio Colella and Lucia Colella by Channel 9.

Mr Colella, aged in his 70s, was found dead in a bedroom and his wife was arrested in the house.

Western Adelaide Superintendent Howard Davies has called the circumstances of the death 'tragic'.

'It appears as though the wife has stabbed the husband,' he said. 'The person (Tony) has injuries to his head.'

'These are very tragic circumstances but why or how it happened will all come out in the investigation.'

Supt Davies did not confirm how many times the man was stabbed, but described the scene as gruesome. 'It is quite stressing for our police officers,' he said.

Police confirmed they have never attended the premises before in relation to domestic violence

Relatives of the couple, including their children, were notified.

Mrs Colella had some injuries and was taken to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a stable condition.

Supt Davies would not confirm if her injuries were self-inflected or a result of self defence.

Police have charged Mrs Colella with murder and said she will remain in custody in hospital and have a bedside court hearing on Monday.

Forensics spent time at the house on Sunday as part of the investigation into the murder.

Supt Davies said South Australian Police had never attended the Alberton home for domestic violence.

Mr Colella, a former bus driver, had three children and was a grandfather and had lived in the home with his wife for about 20 years, reported Nine News.

Neighbour Alf Strappazzon told Nine News Adelaide the death was a loss for everyone affected.

'It's a tragedy for the neighbourhood, it's a tragedy for their family,' he said.

Mr Strappazzon called the couple 'personable' and said they tended to mind their own business.

The couple's home is located in the north west Adelaide suburb of Alberton
