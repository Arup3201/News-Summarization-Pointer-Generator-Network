A man claims he suffered serious emotional trauma at the hands of the federal government after Google auto-corrected his innocent web search into something sinister.

When he typed ‘how do I build a radio controlled’ in October 2009, former government contractor Jeffrey Kantor says Google auto-completed his search to read: ‘how do I build a radio controlled bomb.’

Now he’s implicated some of Washington’s top brass in a bizarre $60 million lawsuit that alleges he was fired from his job after the government stalked him and used his co-workers to emotionally abuse him.

Bombshell: Jeffrey Kantor claims Google auto-completed his web search to ask 'How to create a radio controlled bomb,' causing the government to harass him for months

Kantor worked for government contractor Appian Corporation at the time of the fated Google search, which he says began innocently as a way to find something his son might like for an upcoming birthday.

But after the search, Kantor says his life became a nightmare as the government began to harass him.

First he says he was harassed by a good cop/bad cop team of government investigators. He says the bad cop even made anti-Semitic comments to him over the course of five months.

According to the complaint obtained by Courthouse News, things continued to worsen from there.

Placing the blame: At a time when many Americans are uncomfortable with the government's extensive monitoring tactics, Kantor is claiming to be a victim and wants those he feels are to blame to pay handsomely

Kantor’s co-workers ‘would repeat 
back Kantor's private information, including emails, websites he went 
to, library books he got from the library, conversations he made in his 
house or in his car, phone calls, information about the contents of his 
house, and then someone would immediately say that there is a person who
 dropped dead from hypertension.’

According to Kantor, these conversations were veiled death threats.

The complaint continues:

‘If
 Kantor ever got angry after his private information was repeated back 
(by slamming a cabinet or typing loudly on his computer), the 
[subcontractor] CRGT and Northrop Grumman employees would tell the same 
story about how there was a neighbor in their community who seemed like 
such a nice guy, but then went on a murder suicide.’

Usual suspects? Kantor is suing top Washington brass as well as the departments and agencies they head up. At left is director of the CIA John Brennan, James Clapper (center) heads National Intelligence, and John Kerry is Secretary in charge of the State Department

Implicating many: Kantor claims Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel and Attorney General Eric Holder also had a hand in the harassment he received from the government. He now wants retribution in the form of $60 million

Every day for three months, Kantor claims he would have to choose to either react to the harassment or ignore it. But if he ignored it, ‘they would instead spend the hour talking about how people drop dead from hypertension.’

He says he was fired from Appian, but that the treatment followed him to other firms.

Kantor even claims the government attached a GPS tracker to his car as part of the stalking.

He’s now suing the state department and Secretary John Kerry, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, the CIA and Director John Brennan, the Defense Department and Secretary Chuck Hagel, and Attorney General Eric Holder.

Kantor is asking for ‘$13.8 million in compensatory damages and $45 million in punitive damages,’ according to his filing.

He’d also like the government to stop stalking him.
