She is a slim size 8 and could hardly be called overweight.

But Cheryl Cole has revealed that she keeps different sizes of jeans in her wardrobe because her weight goes up and down.

‘I’m like any other woman, my weight fluctuates,’ she said. ‘I have a pair of jeans one size bigger than the other just in case that week I’m a little bit heavier. I work out and try to make healthy choices.'

The 28-year-old singer, whose weight has been the matter of much discussion over the years, had to put on the pounds after battling malaria in 2010 while visiting Tanzania and dropping to a gaunt size 6.

Asked about diets, she told Marie Claire magazine: 'I try to avoid them like the plague. That can get you into a vicious circle. I did when I was younger.'

She revealed that she was sent into a panic over her weight when she found fame with Girls Aloud in 2002 after winning ITV talent show Popstars: The Rivals.

Priorities changed: The singer admitted she had toned down her hectic lifestyle somewhat since her terrifying brush with malaria in 2010

'When I first got in the band I remember
the first mean story I read  where newspapers called us "Pork Stars" - 
because the show was called Pop Stars: The Rivals. We were all fat... we
were all fat! Not fat, chubby.

'And Louis Walsh had come out publicly and said, "They're all fat. They all need to lose weight." And the record label sent us all to have training.'

When asked if ‘training’ meant 'fat camp', she replied: 'Probably, but we were just thinking they were doing us a favour at the time. We were so deluded.'

Cheryl has slammed Girls Aloud's ex-manager Louis Walsh, saying the group barely spoke to him during their working relationship from 2002 to 2005.

'Louis claimed to be our manager but he never did it,' she told Marie Claire. 'We didn't talk to him or anything like that. He just took a cheque.

'Zero involvement... We managed ourselves. He never chose a hit. Who chose them? Us.

Cole said his biggest contribution was publicly labelling the girls 'fat,' casuing the record label to order them into training.

'Louis said, "They're all fat. They all need to lose weight."'

The singer said she ‘just ate 
everything’ after her brush with malaria, and has previously spoken 
about how being ill changed her priorities.

'It’s now less about work, work, work and more about making time to chill and be with my friends and family,' she said.

The star also confessed to a crush on Prince Harry. 'I love Prince Harry,' she said.

'Actually, I had a dream last night I married Prince Harry and was a real-life princess! It’s true.'
