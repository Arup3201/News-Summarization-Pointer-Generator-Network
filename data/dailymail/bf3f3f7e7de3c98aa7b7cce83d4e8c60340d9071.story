Daley Blind rescued Manchester United from defeat at West Bromwich Albion with a last-gasp equaliser - but their defiant manager Louis van Gaal amazingly still insists that he can win the Barclays Premier League. 

The Dutchman said: 'Call me arrogant but we can still catch Chelsea. I have done it before.'

The draw leaves Van Gaal with only one more point than David Moyes achieved after eight games last season — but he has a fixture list from hell awaiting him.

United face Chelsea, Manchester City and Arsenal in the next four games. They twice trailed to West Brom, who scored through Stephane Sessegnon and Saido Berahino.

But Blind curled home from the edge of the area late on to add to Marouane Fellaini's first goal for the club.

Van Gaal said: 'It is two points lost. I think we were the better team. I am very disappointed about the result.  

Van Gaal said his decision to bring on Marouane Fellaini at half time came just a few minutes into the game

Fellaini scored a stunning goal just two minutes after replacing Ander Herrera at the break

'I don't think West Bromwich Albion has created many chances, I think zero, and we gave the two goals away.

'We have created four chances in the first half and seven in the second half. I am happy about our playing style but not happy with the result.' 

United missed the chance to re-enter the Champions League places and lie sixth, 10 points behind Chelsea. 

Yet Van Gaal claimed the gap could still be clawed back. 'That's possible but it is difficult to say,' he said.

'But I am arrogant because I have done it a lot of times.'

Van Gaal brought on Fellaini to replace Ander Herrera at half-time but said he made the decision after only a few minutes of the match. 

'We have to look also for physical talents and maybe that's our problem,' he said.

'I'm a coach who is always thinking about creative players but in England you also need physical bodies and Fellaini is one of these.

Saido Berahino looked to have secured all three points for the hosts when he beat David de Gea

Van Gaal bemoaned the fact that the Baggies scored from their only two clear-cut chances to earn a point

'He made a very good substitution but he's always injured and we have to build him up.'

Blind, whose late goal was his first since joining United in the summer, was pleased with his impact, but said a win would have been even better.

'I want to be a player who also scores goals,' said Blind. 'But I'd prefer three points.'
