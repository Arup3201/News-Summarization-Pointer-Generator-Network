Women experience more mental health problems than men due to stress-related pressure, according to a new mental health report.

The Australian Psychological Society's survey of stress and wellbeing also found 2014 was a tough year for women, with many reporting significantly higher levels of stress in their day-to-day lives.

More than 70 percent of Australians reported their current stress levels had an impact on their physical health.

But worryingly, 64 per cent reported current stress levels had an impact on their mental health.

'Stress can have an extremely detrimental effect on a person's mental and physical health,' APS executive director Professor Lyn Littlefield said.

'It's important to first identify the cause of stress to work towards avoiding the source, or adopting stress management behaviours.

'Different people are affected by different things, but it is interesting to see the varying impact family and personal financial issues have on stress levels for men and women.'

Australians aged 66 and over continued to report significantly higher levels of wellbeing

More than half of women found that personal financial issues as a major factor of stress-related pressure

More than half (53 percent) of women found that personal financial issues are a major factor of stress-related pressure, compared to just 44 percent of men.

While more than half (52 percent) of all women reported family issues are a major source of stress compared to just 38 percent of men.

Women also reported a greater impact of stress on their health, with 21 percent of women than 13 percent men saying that stress was strongly impacting their physical health.

And more women (23 percent) than men (14 percent) reported that stress was strongly impacting their mental health.

Majority of Australians say stress is affecting their mental health, while there's a widening wellbeing gap between the sexes, new report says
