A Scottish airport has been shortlisted in the hunt to find the world's most iconic and scenic plane landings 

Barra Airport, Scotland - and the world's - only regular beach runway has been selected as one of the world's most stunning airport approaches in a competition which sees the small island airport go head to head with some of the best known destinations.

The airport is competing for top spot in a poll by PrivateFly.com, the leading private jet booking service, against some of the world's most iconic airports, including Rio de Janeiro, Cape Town, Venice, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Hong Kong.

A voter said of Barra Airport in Scotland: 'Where else in the world can you fly over majestic mountains, stunning coastline and turquoise seas before descending over an historic harbour castle and landing on a large silver sand beach? Totally stunning and totally unique. Nothing comes close.'

David Scowsill, president & CEO, World Travel & Tourism Council said of Saba in the Caribbean: 'A simply unforgettable and thrilling landing on the world's shortest runway, flanked by cliffs and ocean with a striking view of its active Volcano, Mount Scenery.'

'This perennial favorite is an AvGeek's dream, for spotting and flying in. There's no room for error, with a short beach on final approach and mountains on departure. But it's always a thrill!' (Benet Wilson, aviation journalist, on Saint Martin in the Caribbean).

Last year's winner of the most iconic airport landing spot was Nice Cote D'Azur, which was praised by voters for its 'sublime beauty'

A a panel of travel industry judges - which include Forbes' Matthew Stibbe, Tiffany Dowd of Luxe Social Media, and Travel Weekly Chairman Clive Jacobs - have chosen 37 airports which they think offer the most stunning views on approach in the world.

Barra, which won the award in 2012, says on their nomination: 'Where else in the world can you fly over majestic mountains, stunning coastline and turquoise seas before descending over an historic harbour castle and landing on a large silver sand beach? Totally stunning and totally unique. Nothing comes close.'

Barra Airport handled 10,560 passengers last year and is one of the smallest airports in the shortlist. By contrast, Sochi airport handles 2.4 million passengers whereas Amsterdam handles more than 50 million passengers.

Planes can only land at Barra when the tide is out and it is the only beach airport which is used by scheduled services.

'A stunning landing to see the Northern lights.' (Matthew Stibbe, Forbes Aviation columnist on Svalbard, Norway)

Travel writer Ana Silva O'Reilly, on her vote for Male, Maldives, wrote: 'It takes a while to get there, but there are places that deserve the word paradise next to their names. On the approach, you will see many of the private hotel islands, and you won’t be able to miss the contrast with the semi-organised chaos of Male island.'

'Scenic approach over the desert, flying right over the strip just gets you in the mood for partying!' (Sylvie Peron, aviation journalist on Las Vegas)

A voter for the Cape Town, South Africa approach: 'Spectacular views of Table Mountain as you approach. One of the most beautiful cities on earth.'

The airstrip was also made famous in the film Staggered starring Martin Clunes.

The shortlist gives a fascinating mix of global descents to experience at least once in a lifetime. From major city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba in the Caribbean.

Bill Prince, deputy editor of GQ said of London City Airport: 'As the city is swept up in its greatest makeover since the Great Fire of London, landing in the beating heart of the world's financial centre takes some beating.'

One voter said of Mustique in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines: 'You feel you might be about to mow the grass on the hilltop as you skim down to the runway - love the arrows reminding the pilot which direction is acceptable.'

On the entry to Rio de Janeiro Airport, a fans wrote:'The view of The Sugar Loaf Mountain and the Guanabara Bay are breathtaking and you land almost on an 'aircraft carrier' runway!'

Last year the winner was Nice Cote D'Azur, which was praised by voters for its 'sublime beauty', 'full range of colours at a glance', and 'amazing views of the French Riviera'. 

Adam Twidell, CEO of poll organiser PrivateFly, experienced pilot and member of the judging panel said: 'The PrivateFly Airport Approaches Poll is an annual checklist for air travel fans. 

'Not for those with faint hearts. Landing at ‘The Rock’ requires a lot of skill (and adverse weather conditions redirect flights to Malaga too often), but if you are lucky it is stunning. Also very interesting to see the geographic differences between nearby Spain and this British territory' (Ana Silva O'Reilly said of Gibraltar)

Chloe Pantazi said of Jackson Hole: 'One of the most beautiful small towns in America, and this airport offers a spectacular view of the Teton Mountains on landing.'

'The descent over the mountains takes one from desert to the lush Pacific Coast and on a Westward approach, gives those on the right hand side a birdseye view of downtown, the Hollywood sign and Beverly Hills.' (Doug Gollan, co-founder Elite Traveler on Los Angeles)

'We asked travel industry experts to put together the shortlist and it includes iconic city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba - the world's shortest commercial runway; or the awe-inspiring mountain scenery at Aspen or Jackson Hole. 

'But it's now up to the travelling public to decide which airport offers the world's very best runway view.'

One voter said of Aruba, the island in the Caribbean: 'The breathtaking views of the whole island as you make you approach are amazing. The turquoise water is so incredibly beautiful. The cliffs on the north side with the surf hitting against them are postcard perfect.'

'During the winter, you only have a chance or two to make the runway, which is on a plateau surrounded by 14,000 foot mountain peaks.' (Benet Wilson, aviation journalist on Telluride, Colorado, US)

'A world class approach to a world class destination. The snatched panoramas as you descend into this hitherto barren-looking landscape makes you realise that pilots do get the best views. (Bill Prince, on Queenstown, New Zealand)
