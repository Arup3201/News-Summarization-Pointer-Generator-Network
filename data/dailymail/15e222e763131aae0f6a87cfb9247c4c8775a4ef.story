'Bobby Zamora had an injury to his Achilles and wouldn't be able to play, so we worked on the team and Dempsey came in to play as a striker in training. 

'By the time matchday came around - Bobby decided he was OK and Roy told Clint just an hour or two before the game.

'Clint is a passionate boy. He doesn't hold back and he decided to punch a window which had thickened glass in the corner of the Cottage.

'Basically half his finger was off and you could see his tendon. Glass shattered - it was some punch by the way. Blood was going everywhere. This was all because he wanted to play of course.'

Murphy added: 'The doctor was there and he bandaged it all up and he came on as a substitute to contributed.

Speaking about his role of captain at the time, the former Liverpool and England midfielder admitted he was in total shock after seeing Dempsey's reaction. 

Murphy said: 'It was tough initially, there was a lot of shock. Even Roy was in shock. Clint calmed down quite quickly when he realised the severity of the injur.

'I was just trying to keep him calm and in the end he did calm down. What was great for me was that Roy didn't punish him and leave him out altogether because it was a real lack of discipline. It was a horrible moment.
