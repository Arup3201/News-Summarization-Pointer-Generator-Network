Conor Kenny is flipping travel photography onto its head – and putting himself in harm’s way – as he poses for a series of wacky ‘selfies’ while doing handstands.

The 23-year-old stuntman has been photographed doing his trademark pose at some of the most well-known and bizarre spots in London and places around the world.

He risked falling into the River Thames while performing the stunt at Tower Bridge, while on other occasions he has shrugged off the dangers while doing handstands on the edge of train platforms or flyovers.

The multi-media design student said: ‘Tower Bridge has been my favourite so far, it's my favourite structure in London and it was a few storeys up.

‘I also did a handstand on the edge of the roof on Adelaide House which is about ten storeys high, you can see the Shard in the back ground so it made a good photo.
