Lucy Li is set to become the youngest ever competitor at the US Women's Open next month, and a quick glance at this video of her unleashing drives aged just eight shows why. 

Li, who is now just 11 years old, completed a runaway victory in the sectional qualifier  at Half Moon Bay in her native California last Monday.

But she was already quite a talent three years ago, as the video shows. Li hits 20 superb drives from balls teed up in a long line at a driving range and, even more impressively, she does not pause for breath once.

Hold the pose: Li gives a taste of the talent that has seen her qualify to play in the US Women's Open

Li's swing remains in motion throughout until she has clattered off the last ball in the line, swinging through each drive before stepping forward to the next ball, swinging back inside it and then unleashing her next shot.

1,622 women representing 46 American states and 51 other countries entered the qualifying process for the chance to play at Pinehurst next month, so to win her own 36-hole marathon by seven shots was some achievement by Li, no matter what her age.

History: Eleven-year-old Li has become the youngest player to qualify for the US Women's Open

Watching brief: Li impressed at the Drive, Chip and Putt Championships at August in April

Li also got to putt on the 18th green at Augusta National in April as the 
runaway winner in her age division in the club’s first Drive, Chip and 
Putt Championship for juniors, but now she will get to play in a full-blown major, as the youngest-ever 
qualifier.

Li got into golf
 only four years ago, and then it was by chance. She was bored waiting 
for her brother and cousin, who were playing in a tournament, so she hit
 a few balls on the driving range.

It
 wasn’t long before she became a student at the Jim McLean golf school 
in Florida. Five months after picking up her first club, she was 
finishing third in her first tournament.

Come out swinging: The 11-year-old will become the youngest-ever participant at a US Women's Open

The 
youngest females to play in the US Women’s Open before Li were Americans
 Morgan Pressel and Lexi Thompson, who were 12. The obvious danger is 
that such bright lights will be extinguished by the time their teenage 
years are over, but Pressel, 25, and Thompson, 19, have both avoided  
burn-out to become major champions in their own right. 

Michelle Wie: At just 11, she won both the Hawaii State Women's Stroke Play Championship - became the youngest player ever to qualify for an LPGA event, and the youngest (13) to ever make the cut at a US Women's Open.

Lexi Thompson: Previously the youngest ever (12) to qualify for the US Women's Open. Now 19, she won the Kraft Nabisco Championship this year.

Guan Tianlang: Made the cut at last year's Masters at the age of 14.
