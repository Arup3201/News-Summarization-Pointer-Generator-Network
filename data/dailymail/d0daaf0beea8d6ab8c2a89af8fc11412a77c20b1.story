An electrician who was almost blinded when he was glassed in the face has slammed the judge who ordered his attacker to pay him just £200 in compensation.

Andrew Stanley, 37, was left scarred for life after Lee Barber hurled a glass at him in an unprovoked attack in a pub.

Mr Stanley needed six stitches to his cheek and three more above his eye and suffered a detached retina leaving him blind for a week.

Constant reminder: Mr Stanley says that the attack has left him with scars that still bleed to this day

But despite his scars still being visible months after the horrific attack, a judge let his attacker walk free from court.

Now Mr Stanley, from Beeston, Nottinghamshire, says this final insult has only added to the stress he is going through.

Barber, 34, a delivery driver also from Beeston, pleaded guilty to one count of assault at Nottingham Crown Court on 1 September.

Recorder Simon Redhead QC spared Barber prison and ordered him to pay Mr Stanley £200 compensation and carry out 100 hours of unpaid work.

Shockingly, the court heard Barber has a string of previous convictions for assault and criminal damage.

Recorder Readhead told him: 'I make it clear to you - you now have had your last chance.

'You will repay your debt to the public by doing unpaid work.'

Mr Stanley was attacked while he enjoyed a drink in May with friends in his local pub, The Cricketers in Beeston.

A group of thugs, including Barber, entered the pub before one attacked Mr Stanley's friend.

When Mr Stanley pulled them apart and headed for the exit Barber launched the glass and a chair at him.

The glass splintered when it hit the left side of Mr Stanley's face - leaving him with scars that still bleed to this day.

Speaking today, Mr Stanley called for the law to be changed so glass attacks were treated as seriously as knifings which carry harsher sentences.

He said: 'The atmosphere changed when these three blokes walked in, including the man who attacked me.

'I knew one of them but he was not someone I would talk too.

'One of the blokes [not the defendant] started on my friend. They were talking about football. One of them pushed my friend. We didn't want no trouble.

'I was leaving the pub when Lee Barber threw the glass at me.

'I am insulted by the £200 compensation. I should have got at least a week's wages. I want judges to take glass attacks as seriously as a knife attack.

'The scar on my face is going to give the wrong impression of me because it makes me look like a thug. This was an unprovoked attack on myself. It was like being stabbed by a knife.

'This week I had a shave for the first time. The scar started pouring with blood again. It reminds me every day what happened that night.

'I will always have to be watching my back now, I am disgusted by this cowardly act.'
