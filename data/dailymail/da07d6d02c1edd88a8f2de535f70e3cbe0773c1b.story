Police spent three weeks trying to evict 14 squatters from the home of a 101-year-old stroke victim after she moved into a care home.

Great-grandmother Megan Wilkinson's home in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire was left empty when she was taken into residential care, and so her family decided to let it out to help pay her medical bills.

But they were horrified when letting agents visited the large detached property to find it had been overrun by squatters.

Megan Wilkinson's home was left empty in in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, when she went into care, and so her family decided to let it out to help pay her medical bills

The house was filled with duvets and the occupants, said to be from Eastern Europe, had been smoking. 

Clothes were scattered across the grass of the back garden and black bags were piled high full of rubbish.

The family called police as soon as the agents alerted them on October 3 but nothing was done.

When they called again three days later the family said police informed them it was a civil matter and they would not get involved.

Officers also told them their best option was to obtain an eviction of trespassers order from court - which could cost £4,000.

It was only when the family called in their local MP that a senior officer 'reviewed' the case and the squatters were removed on Wednesday - three weeks after moving in.

Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Ann, who lives in Germany, said her mother had lived in the house for 65 years before suffering her stroke.

It had left her partially paralysed and in need of 24-hour care - and the problem with the squatters made her stressed at a time when she needed to recover.

Her daughter said: 'The agents had been carrying out a viewing and arrived at the house to find all these people inside.

'I rang the police to inform them about trespassers. Nothing happened.

'I rang again on October 6, whereupon the police went to our property with our agent and gave these so-called tenants seven days' notice to vacate because they were trespassing.'

It is believed the squatters got into the house as decorators did it up and managed to steal a set of house keys.

She added: 'There were about 14 people but only four said they were renting and 10 were visiting.

'Duvets were seen strewn over the floors of the bedrooms and there was evidence of smoking.

'Although we were given a crime reference number by the police they told our solicitor it was a squatter trespass but should be treated as a civil matter.

Her family were horrified when letting agents visited the large detached property to find it had been overrun by squatters and so called in police 

'We were told there was no other option but to obtain an eviction of trespassers order from court, which could cost £4,000.'

The house stood empty yesterday with boards covering the downstairs windows and rubbish in the driveway.

Tatty orange curtains were partly drawn on the upstairs windows and the front garden was overgrown with weeds.

An empty cupboard and two dirty mattresses had also been left dumped on the driveway.

Tory MP for Peterborough Stewart Jackson, who was asked to help by the family's solicitor, yesterday accused the police of 'a lack of common sense'.

He said: 'I was very concerned that the police were inferring that they couldn't take any action and that it was a civil matter.

'What we have seen here is a lack of common sense from the police and a lack of urgency. I have made my opinions very clear to the police.

'Police should be careful about setting a precedence that they are a soft touch.

'Sometimes the police are too worried about being politically correct.'

He said he would be writing to Peterborough City Council to say he would be 'very unhappy' if the squatters were now given priority on the housing list over local families.

Cambridgeshire police announced that they had visited the property on Wednesday and evicted the occupants.

The house is now boarded up, and black bags have been piled high full of rubbish

A spokesman said: 'Initially the tenant and the estate agents had put in civil measures to try to remove the occupants from the property, however that was not successful.

'That decision was reviewed by a more senior officer and it was decided that these people were acting illegally and officers intervened.

'Four men and two women were asked to pack their things and vacate the property which they did and no force was needed. 

'Officers will be looking further into the matter and also into the way the issue was handled.' 

A elderly woman who lived near to Mrs Wilkinson said she was a 'pleasant lady' who would always ask people in for a sherry.

The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said she thought Mrs Wilkinson had not been living in the house for around four years.

She said: 'She was a nice woman, well educated and a pleasure to speak to. She would walk past two times a day with her little dog.

'Everyone knew her but she left three or four years ago to live in Germany with her daughter. The whole area has changed since then.

'She would be the kind of lady to ask anyone who knocked on her door in for a sherry.'
