Representing your country at the World Cup is one of the greatest honours a footballer can receive but it seems the pride of playing at this summer's tournament is making players emotional.

After Neymar was spotted crying as Brazil's national anthem played ahead of their 0-0 draw with Mexico on Monday, Ivory Coast midfielder Serey Die is the latest player to have broken down in tears ahead of kick-off.

Die and his team-mates stood full of 
pride as the Ivory Coast national anthem began to play ahead of his 
side's Group C clash with Colombia on Thursday evening but the 29-year-old soon burst into tears.

All too much: Serge Aurier, Cheick Tiote and Didier Zokora all had to console the midfielder before kick-off

Proud moment: Die's World Cup appearance comes just a year after making his international debut

Sporting a blond mohawk, Die tried to keep a stiff upper lip in an attempt to belt out the words but just couldn't control his pride at representing his country at such a huge occasion.

Defender Serge Aurier and former Tottenham man Didier Zokora were quick to console Die before the match got underway while Newcastle star Cheick Tiote put an arm around him.

Die revealed the reasons for his tears on Instagram and said: ‘It was just the emotions of pride
to be Ivorian and serve my country that have made me cry because I [never]
thought [for] a day [I would] be at that level.’

However, having dried his eyes and taken to the field, Die was again the centre of attention during the first half.

After Colombia were awarded a free-kick by referee Howard Webb following Die's tussle with Juan Camilo Zuniga, the Ivory Coast man swiftly fell to the floor with his hands over his face before letting out a roar of frustration.

BBC's World Cup host Gary Lineker tweeted: 'May well have just seen one of the worst and oddest dives in World Cup history from Die Serey. Have a look at halftime.'

The midfield man, who has spent the last six years playing in Switzerland for FC Sion and Basel, only made his international debut in March 2013.

Ivory Coast went on to lose the match against Colombia courtesy of goals from James Rodriguez and Juan Quintero while Gervinho scored a consolation late on.
