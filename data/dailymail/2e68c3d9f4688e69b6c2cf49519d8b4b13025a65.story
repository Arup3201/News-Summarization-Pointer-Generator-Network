These spectacular images capture a colourful kingfisher creating a splash as it darts into a river and successfully emerges with a snack.

The beating wings of the striking blue and orange bird kick up spray as it hits the water while hunting for fish in the Kent countryside.

The charismatic birds can reach speeds of up to 25 miles-per-hour as they dive-bomb into rivers and ponds to target their prey.

Making a splash: A colourful British kingfisher was captured cooling off in Kent by photographer Mark Bridger as it hunted for fish

This kingfisher, caught on camera by rambler Mark Bridger, appeared to be luxuriating in the cool water as it hunted in the balmy August temperatures.

Pre-press operator Mr Bridger, 44, who is from 
from West Malling in Kent, took the stunning wildlife shots while out on a walk in the countryside.

'Our country has some of the best wildlife found anywhere in the world,' he said.

'There a lot more to the British Isles than just ducks and small brown birds. In particular I love kingfishers and I have always wanted to photograph them diving,' Mr Bridger said, adding that catching the darting bird at just the right moment was not easy.

'It was very difficult to capture these shots,' he said.

'But I really like the way the bird emerged from the water after he dived. It shows how much effort on his part it is to take off again.'

Spectacular wildlife: The kingfisher is known for hunting and feeding on fish - quickly darting towards the water once it spots its prey

Splash landing: The photographer captured the strikingly coloured kingfisher hitting the water with a splash

Native birds: Britain is home to between 5,000 and 8,000 breeding pairs of kingfishers, which dive-bomb into water at up to 25 miles per hour to catch their prey

Dive-bombing: The charismatic birds can be found living across the whole of the British Isles, with the exception of the west of Ireland, the Outer Hebrides, and North West Scotland

'Effort': The bird's blue wings shimmer in the water as it emerges from the river in the Kent countryside

Nice catch: The blue and orange kingfisher propels itself back out of the water with a tiny fish in its beak

Successful day of hunting: The bird's tiny prey stood no chance against the speedy kingfisher, which can dive at up to 25 miles per hour to catch a fish in its sharp beak

Britain is home to between 5,000 and 8,000 breeding pairs of kingfishers at any one time.

They can be found across the whole of the British Isles - living wild in lakes, rivers and even garden ponds - except the west of Ireland, the Outer Hebrides and the edge of northwest Scotland.

'People get pleasure from my images and I have had quite a lot of great comments,' said Mr Bridger.

'But I try not to disturb an animal just for the sake of a photograph.'
