It's up there with the stupidest things humankind has ever done.

Two giggling women have been filmed twerking on the New York subway - in path of thundering trains and inches from a 600-volt rail.

Police are investigating the video, in which a male friend can be heard laughing as the tattooed pair in black sweatshirts plead: 'No face! No face!'.

Unsafe: The scene is thought to be on the 8th Avenue line where trains run 24 hours a day on a live rail

A Metropolitan Transport Authority spokesman told the New York Daily News the video is thought to have been shot on the 8th Avenue line, which carries subway routes A, C and E.

The three routes run 24 hours a day and trains are as often as every five minutes.

They also use a 600-volt live rail - which it appears can be seen in the video and has caused high-profile deaths recently.

The shocking clip has been viewed more than 50,000 times in the day since it was uploaded to YouTube, prompting outrage on the video sharing site.

Several users said the pair should 'win a Darwin award' for their supposed attempt to eliminate themselves from the gene pool.

Craze: Twerking has gone global since Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke performed at the VMA awards

Others complained they were not very good at twerking.

The
rump-shaking craze has exploded since pop star Miley Cyrus performed 
the energetic dance with Robin Thicke at the VMA awards earlier this year.

Videos have flooded the internet of twerkers performing in some curious places, including libraries, car bonnets, church and even - in one case - on the grave of the performer's grandmother.

The video has been passed to the NYPD, who are investigating.

One viewer on Youtube suggested it could also have been shot at Fordham Road station in the Bronx.

It is on the D line, which also runs all night with trains as often as every six minutes.

It comes after high-profile deaths involving the lethal live rail on New York's subway over the summer.

Matthew Zeno, 30, drunkenly urinated on the 600-volt rail in Brooklyn and was killed by the current passing through the stream. A friend who tried to help him was also injured.

Another man was fatally electrocuted two weeks later when he dropped his cellphone on the tracks in Greenwich Village and jumped down to find it.

In February, New York recorded nine subway injuries - three of which were fatal - over just six days.

The third rail is used to power trains and usually carries a standard 625 volts.

It becomes fatal when people or animals connect it to the ground. If part of a person is touching the ground and part is touching the live rail, the current will take the shortest route to earth, handing its victim a lethal dose of electricity.
