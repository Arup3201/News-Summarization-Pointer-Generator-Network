Lawyers for accused balcony killer Gable Tostee say possible delays of up to six months in preparing the police case against the Gold Coast playboy are causing his defence team 'great concern'.

As tensions emerged between Tostee's new legal team and investigators, police said rushing the presentation of the brief of evidence would be 'setting the prosecution up to fail'.

Lawyers for Tostee complained on Friday about police delays in gathering evidence, as detectives said they were still seeking overseas witnesses and evidence in the murder case of 26-year-old Warriena Wright, who allegedly fell to her death from Tostee's high rise Surfers Paradise apartment on August 8.

Defence lawyer Kate Clark told Magistrate Kerry Magee in Southport Magistrate's Court she was 'seeking explanations for the delay' in police putting together their case against Tostee. Ms Clark said examining the electronic evidence against Tostee alone could delay the case by four to five months.

Ms Clark appeared for Robertson O'Gorman solicitors, Tostee's new legal firm after he recently sacked his previous lawyers.

Ms Clark told Magistrate Magee that only the preliminary autopsy report on Ms Wright's body, analysis of mobile phone records, some witness statements and photographs of the crime scene and the post mortem examination were available.

Delays in presenting other evidence against Tostee were causing the defence 'great concern', Ms Clark said. 

'I am seeking a review of the mention date so I can better understand the delay in the brief,' Ms Clark said. She sought a 14 day adjournment but police prosecutor Sergeant Michael Campbell sought more time.

Sgt Campbell said there had been 'difficulties' preparing the brief of evidence and that police were working with international agencies and witnesses.

A quick turnaround in presenting the brief would be 'setting the prosecution up to fail', he said.

Gable Tostee was an active Tinder dater in the months leading up to his meeting Warriena Wright on August 

It is alleged the pair were captured on CCTV at 8.45pm meeting outside a surf shop before going to a shop to buy beer. They then allegedly went to Tostee's apartment where they socialise and drink 

Magistrate McGee asked for further evidence in the police case against Tostee, who did not make an appearance via audio visual link from Queensland's Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre, be provided by November 14.

She remanded Tostee, who has been in custody since August 15, until January 12. 

Ms Magee also stood over four other charges the 28-year-old allegedly committed in two separate overnight drunken incidents in the months before his alleged Tinder date with Ms Wright.

The court heard that the latter two offences were alleged to have occurred during a car pursuit from NSW over the Queensland border and that Tostee is due to appear in a northern NSW Court next month over related charges alleged to have been committed in that state.

Ms Clark said police analysis of evidence also needed to be expedited for the resumption of Tostee's bail application, which has yet to be listed.   

Last month, transcripts of an alleged tape recording of Ms Wright's final hour and a half in Tostee's company were tendered to the court by the Crown during his bail application in the Brisbane Supreme Court.

The application, which has been adjourned to allow the accused's defence team to compile a report on Tostee's mental state and alleged autism, has yet been given a date to resume.

Details of the transcript, which Tostee's new legal representatives described as 'prejudicial' and a 'threat to justice' in the murder case, included what prosecutors claimed were 'sounds consistent with the deceased being held down and her airway restricted'. 

It is alleged in the documents submitted by the Crown to the court that sounds of groaning can be heard, then the male tells the woman she is being too rough during sex, and says 'I don't like being beaten up'.

Noises of an apparent struggle begin at about 2.10am after the sound of drinks being poured had been heard a few minutes earlier.

Over the next few minutes the argument gets worse and at 2.13am the sounds of a struggle are interspersed with his swearing and her saying 'OK, it is all good' while she sounds out of breath.

The Crown brief says 'the sounds of restricted breathing continue for 78 seconds'.

During the 10 minutes leading up to 2.21am he calls her a 'god damn psycho' twice and there are further sounds of the struggle.

The Crown alleged in the brief: 'There are sounds of slapping and [Tostee] saying 'let go, let go'. The sounds of restricted breathing coninue for 78 seconds and only stops when there is the sounds of something dropping and then [Tostee] complains about her trying to hit him.

'At this stage the deceased's airway is no longer restricted and she starts yelling out 'no' repeatedly,' the Crown briefed claimed. 

'This escalates in crescendo and anxiety and there are sounds of the balcony door being opened, and scuffling consistent with [Tostee] dragging the deceased towards the balcony.'

The Crown continues: 'This part of the struggle' takes just under one minute, commencing 'at 2.19.48am and continues until 2.20.46am, at which point the door can be heard slamming shut leaving the deceased on the balcony and [Tostee] inside the unit.

'The last thing said before the deceased is outside the balcony is her screams intensifying as she screams 'just let me go home'.

'[Tostee] says in a very aggressive tone, 'I would but you have been a bad girl'.

'Her voice becomes more muffled and it is apparent she is on the other side of the door.

The Crown brief continued: 'At 2.21.12am, one hour, 24 minutes and 25 seconds into the recording, a scream can be heard that fades, consistent with the deceased falling.'  

Tostee has maintained his innocence.
