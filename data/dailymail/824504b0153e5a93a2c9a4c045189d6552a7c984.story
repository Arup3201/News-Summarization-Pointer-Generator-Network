Unbeaten in the Premier League, five points ahead of their nearest rivals, everything is going to plan for Jose Mourinho.

And the Portuguese boss, who is usually extra-critical when examining his team, admits he is 'happy with everything' at Chelsea this season.

Mourinho's side have only dropped points against closest rivals Manchester City, and have outscored every team in the division.

And he says the Blues are now strong enough to be able to cope with everything that is thrown their way.

'I am happy with everything. In this moment our team are able to adapt to everything,' Mourinho told the Evening Standard. 'What the game gives us, we can cope with. We are not the kind of team that play only the same way, think the same things. 

'We can play in a different way and adapt to different situations.

'When teams have the ball we are comfortable, when we have the chance to pass and touch the ball, we are comfortable. 

'When we play in counter-attack, we are comfortable. In this moment the team are mature and confident and I'm very happy.'

Mourinho also cites Petr Cech replacing Thibaut Courtois in goal as an example of Chelsea's strength in depth

One topic Mourinho boasts about is the lack of 'football panic' at Chelsea in certain situations.

He cites Thibaut Courtois' injury against Arsenal as an example, as experienced stopper Petr Cech replaced him.

'Only we can lose a keeper and not panic. We lost a keeper and the panic was just what the kid [Courtois] has [suffered].

'But as for the football panic and talk of "oh my god what is going to happen?" - the other one [Cech] just come in and no-one in the seats feels any fear because we know the big guy is there for us too. Petr is so solid, so confident, so under control, so we are fine.'
