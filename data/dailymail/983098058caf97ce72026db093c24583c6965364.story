A
barman who 'mooned' the Queen with an Australian flag tucked between 
the cheeks of his bare bottom today threatened to do the same to Barack Obama if he returns
to the country.

Liam Warriner, from Sydney, pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance after a
second charge of wilful exposure was dropped. He was fined  
AUS$750 (£510).

The 22-year-old flashed the Queen, 85, and Prince Philip, 90, as their motorcade travelled through Brisbane when they visited 
Queensland in October, Brisbane Magistrates Court heard today.

Remorseless: Liam Warriner today pleaded guilty to a charge of public nuisance at Brisbane Magistrates Court. He was fined AUS$750 (£510) for 'mooning the Queen in the city last October

Guest of honour: The Queen, accompanied by Prince Philip and Queensland Premier Anna Bligh, walks down a slipway to board a cruiser on the Brisbane River. Shortly beforehand, police said the monarch was 'mooned' by Warriner as she passed him in her motorcade

Warriner dropped his trousers and ran 
alongside the motorcade for 50 yards with an Australian flag clasped 
between the cheeks of his buttocks.

It is not known if the Queen, who was travelling in a limousine with a police escort, saw the incident.

The court heard that Warriner told 
police he mooned the monarch as a political protest to show his contempt 
for her and elitist groups.

Magistrate Anne Thacker was not amused by his behaviour.

She said: 'This is a civil society and when a 
lot of people gather in one place the grouping means there is a 
vulnerable position if even one person like yourself doesn't behave in a
civil manner.'

Warriner lawyer's described the mooning as 'low level stuff'.

Police had asked for the maximum fine of $1,000 (£678).

Outside court, Warriner turned his anger on the media and high-profile people.

He described the media, which has given prominence to his case as it has proceeded through the courts, as 'evil'.

He encouraged the Occupy movement to 'rock on' and said he would 'moon' President Obama if he came to Australia.

He appeared to have forgotten that 
the U.S. president has already visited Australia, arriving for a 28-hour 
visit in November, less than three weeks after the Queen departed 
following her ten-day tour of part of the country.

Warriner appeared unconcerned about being charged.

'Any self-important, self-propagating elitist... I will happily bare my buttocks,' he said outside court.

Sergeant Troy Newman told the court 
that Warriner had shown a selfish attitude to score a political point 
during a formal and respectful occasion.

An unrepentant Warriner said he was 'a proud anti-monarchist'.

'What's uncivilised about it?' he said of his buttocks protest. 'We come into the world naked.'

He said people wrongly likened the 
Queen to their own grandmother: 'The Queen does not get cute granny 
status. She's a very powerful woman.'

He claimed that police had called him
a 'd*******' a few times - but denied that people would agree with the 
officers who questioned him after the incident.

He said: 'I can guarantee you most people do not agree.

'The Queen represents where people 
can be born into importance. I don't think that any one family should 
have more importance than any other family on this planet.'

As well as targeting President Obama 
for a similar protest should he return to Australia, Warriner said the 
Australian Labour Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, would not be immune 
from his style of protest.
