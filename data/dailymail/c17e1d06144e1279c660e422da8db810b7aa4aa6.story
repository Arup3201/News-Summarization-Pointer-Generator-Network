Debra Denison chatted with day care workers as they helped load her two grandsons into her van.

It had been a day full of smiles and cupcakes for two-year-old Alton Perry, who was celebrating his birthday, and nothing seemed amiss, said Nikki Salaun, the director of the Kidds & Co. day care.

But instead of taking the children home as planned, Denison vanished on Tuesday and left behind a suicide note.

After a frantic search, she and her grandsons, two-year-old Alton Perry and 6-month-old Ashton Perry, were found shot to death in an apparent murder-suicide.

Debra Denison is believed to have shot to death her two-year-old and six-month-old grandchildren before turning the gun on herself. Here she is pictured with Alton, who was found dead in the car alongside his little brother Ashton and his grandmother

'We've all gone over it in our 
heads,' Salaun said. 'Did she say something that we could have picked up
on? But no, there was nothing alarming.'

Relatives said Denison had struggled 
with mental health problems, and had attempted suicide in 1989 and 1990,
but family and friends were left struggling to understand what could 
have prompted the violence.

'She would go along and have seasons 
where everything was A-OK, and other times when she would be depressed, 
running to the doctor and getting prescriptions,' said Marcia White, a 
paternal great-grandmother of the slain boys. 'She seemed to be doing 
well.'

The boys' parents told WVIT-TV that 
Denison had split personalities and family members told WFSB-TV that she
had bipolar disorder.

According to the Hartford Courant, her
second husband filed for divorce in 1989 and the file includes 
documents that say Denison attempted suicide at least three times and 
was committed to the psychiatric ward at The William W. Backus Hospital 
in Norwich for more than a month in early 1990.

Documents in the file indicate she 
struggled with alcohol, committed crimes and was found by a judge to be 
not competent to care for her children.

The bodies of 47-year-old Denison and
the boys were found in a car parked near Lake of Isles in Preston, in 
the southeastern corner of Connecticut, a town over from the boys' day 
care center in North Stonington.

Denison had been to the day care before and was on a list of people authorized to pick up the children.

Denison's daughter, Brenda Perry, the
boys' mother, had worked at the center several years ago. She now works
at a local school and her husband, Jeremy, was a landscaper, Salaun 
said.

Salaun and day care center co-owner 
Christine Hare had attended Perry's baby showers and weren't surprised 
when she enrolled her boys there in October.

'Those boys were her world,' Saloun said. 'She coveted her family. Those boys were everything.'

Alton, with his piercing blue eyes, was always smiling behind his ever-present pacifier, Hare said.

He was nicknamed 'the greeter' at the
day care because he always went to meet visitors at the door while 
other children hung back.

Their mother had brought in 
mini-cupcakes for the toddler room to celebrate his birthday. She told 
staff that Denison would be picking up the children.

Salaun and Hare said that they were 
aware Denison had some mental health issues in the past but that she was
friendly and talkative on Tuesday.

'Brenda obviously put her on the list
thinking she would be OK,' Hare said. 'We go with the parents. We can't
override their wishes. Obviously, if she had come here obviously 
distraught, we would have intervened.'

After helping Denison to her van with the children, the staff discovered she had taken the wrong car seat.

Brenda, the mother of the pair, posted: ''God has two beautiful angels helping him now'

When they couldn't reach her by 
phone, they alerted Perry, who contacted police. The bodies were found 
at around 9:30pm on Tuesday, about two hours after state police issued a
statewide Amber Alert.

As state police were searching, they learned that Denison had left her home armed with a revolver and they found a suicide note.

Investigators have not released Denison's suicide note, but it is believed to have said that God spared her 13-year-old son.

Denison was supposed to pick up her teenage son, Jason, before she headed to the day care to pick up her grandsons.

White, the great-grandmother, said 
Denison picked the children up alone Tuesday even though their mother 
asked her to bring along another relative. White says Denison's 
struggles with mental health were well known and Perry told Denison the 
boys were too much for her to handle.

White said Perry told her that Denison asked to pick the boys up to be with Alton on his birthday.

'She was apparently very convincing,'
said White, who expressed frustration that a gun was apparently 
available inside the house despite Denison's mental health history. She 
said the gun belonged to Denison's husband.

Denison also had a 13-year-year-old 
son who wasn't with her Tuesday afternoon. In her suicide note, she said
in part that God was watching over him Tuesday, White said.

What exactly she meant by that, and her motive for the killings and suicide, remain unclear.

In Facebook postings, Brenda Perry 
thanked people for their prayers and said she loved her sons. 'God (has)
two beautiful angels helping him now,' the postings said.

A man who answered the door at the 
family home on Wednesday declined to comment, and a man at the address 
listed for Denison said the family is asking for space.

Denison's criminal record appeared 
clean. She had two convictions for minor driving offenses, said Peggy 
Muckle, a clerk at New London Superior Court.

She was fined $35 in 2003 for 
following too closely and, in 2004, she pleaded guilty to reckless 
driving, but a judge didn't require her to pay the $100 fine.

Denison and her husband, Jance 
Denison, have had financial problems over the past several years, 
including a $5,926 state tax lien put on their home last month.

There were several other liens on the
Denison's home dating back to the late 1990s, mostly in Jance Denison's
name, records show.

They included three liens totaling 
more than $3,900 against Debra Denison by The William W. Backus Hospital
in Norwich and a $668 lien by Connecticut Behavioral Health Associates 
against Jance and Debra Denison.

Denison's daughter, Brenda Perry, 
wrote on her Facebook page early yesterday: 'Thank you for your 
prayers... My boys are in an amazing place, we've got a few great angels
watching over us,' adding that 'my mom was sick.'

Earlier Tuesday,
Denison had picked up the brothers from their daycare in Danielson and 
was supposed to take them to Alton's birthday party, where family 
members were waiting to celebrate.

Connecticut State Police issued an Amber Alert when the family grew concerned. Officers were alerted to their bodies later in the evening

Investigation: Police cars blocked off Lake of Isles Road, where the car and bodies were found

Ms Salaun and daycare center co-owner
Christine Hare said the boys' mother worked at the daycare center 
herself a couple years and had mentioned that the grandmother had a 
history of mental health troubles.

At about 9.30pm, police received a 
report of a suspicious vehicle parked near the Lake of Isles golf course
with three injured people inside, two of whom appeared to be children.

The two boys and their grandmother were pronounced dead at the scene.

Mother Brenda Perry, married to father Jeremy since October 2010, posted  'God has two beautiful angels helping him now', after the Amber Alert was called off.

She
today posted on Facebook: 'Thank you for the prayers. I ask for you to 
also pray for my brother and sister. They lost three people last night.

'My boys are in an amazing place, we got a few great angels watching over us. Love you Ashton and Alton.'

WaterfordPatch, quoting Connecticut 
State Police, reported that she shot and killed the children with a 
.38-caliber handgun before turning the gun on herself.
