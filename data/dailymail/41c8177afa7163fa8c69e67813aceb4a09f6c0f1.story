A British skydiver is feared dead after going missing during a jump from a plane over the Algarve.

Jonathon Wickham disappeared after leaping from an aircraft at 15,000 feet above the resort of Portimao with a group of experienced parachutists.

A search was resuming today after police and firefighters failed to find any trace of him yesterday.

Fellow skydivers reported seeing expat Mr Wickham, believed to be originally from Ormskirk, west Lancashire, tumbling out of control with his chute still closed moments after leaping from their plane.

A source at Portimao Aerodrome, where the aircraft took off from, said: 'We don't know at this stage what happened, whether he fell ill after jumping, or if it was down to something else.

'Three colleagues saw him falling out of control with his parachute still closed at 10,000 feet.

'That was the last time he was seen.'

A sea and land search involving military and maritime police and firefighters failed to find any search of the missing Briton by nightfall yesterday.

The operation was due to resume early this morning over the western Algarve.

Authorities were offering psychological support to the relatives of Mr Wickham, who lives in the Algarve and is thought to run a shade installation firm.
