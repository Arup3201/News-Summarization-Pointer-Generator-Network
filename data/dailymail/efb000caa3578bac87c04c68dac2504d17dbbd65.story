Britain may once have had an empire on which the sun never set – but a study shows its true global reach was far more extensive than maps would suggest.

Throughout the ages, Britain has invaded almost 90 per cent of the world’s countries.

An analysis of the histories of almost 200 nations found that only 22 have never experienced a British assault.

British rule: A map of the world shows in red the extent of the British Empire in 1901 but a new study has found the Empire's global reach was underestimated and that almost 90 per cent of the world's countries have been invaded by Britain

These include Luxembourg as well as Guatemala, Tajikistan and the Marshall Islands in the Pacific.

The study – part of a new book, All 
the Countries We’ve Ever Invaded: And the Few We Never Got Round To – 
comes against the background of maps which show that at its height the 
Empire ruled over almost a quarter of the world’s population.

Author Stuart Laycock worked his way 
around the countries on the globe alphabetically to see if British 
forces had ever strayed into each territory.

However, only a very small proportion of his total list of invaded countries made up formal dominions of the Empire.

The remainder have been included if a 
military incursion was achieved through force, the threat of force, or 
by negotiation or payment.

Raids by British pirates, privateers and 
armed explorers have been included if they were acting on the behalf or 
approval of the government.

Therefore, many countries that once 
formed part of the Spanish empire and seem to have little historical 
connection with the UK, such as Costa Rica, Ecuador and El Salvador, 
made the list because of the repeated raids they suffered from 
state-sanctioned British sailors.

The earliest invasion launched from 
the British Isles was an incursion into Gaul, northern France, at the 
end of the second century. 

Clodius Albinus led an army, thought to 
include many Britons, across the Channel in  an attempt to seize the 
imperial throne. The force was defeated in 197AD at Lyon.

Other invasions highlighted in the 
book include that of Iceland  in 1940 after the neutral nation refused 
to enter the war on the Allies’ side.

Two-year project: Author Stuart Laycock started writing the book after his son asked him how many countries the British Empire had invaded

The invasion force, of 745 
marines, met with strong protest from the Iceland government, but no 
resistance.

Mr Laycock, who has previously 
published books on Roman history, began the two-year research after 
being asked by his 11-year-old son, Frederick, how many countries the 
British had invaded.

‘I was absolutely staggered when I 
reached the total,’ he said. ‘I like to think I have a relatively good 
general knowledge, but there are places where it hadn’t occurred  to me 
that these things had ever happened. It shocked me.

‘On one level, for the British, it is 
quite amazing and quite humbling, that this is all part of our history, 
but clearly there are parts of our history that we are less proud of. 
The book is not intended as any kind of moral judgment on our history or
our empire. It is meant as a bit of fun.’

The only other nation which has 
achieved anything approaching the British total, Mr Laycock said, is 
France – which also holds the record for having endured the most British
invasions.

He is now asking for the public help 
in listing more British invasions. Mongolia is listed as never been 
invaded, but Mr Laycock believes it could have been.
