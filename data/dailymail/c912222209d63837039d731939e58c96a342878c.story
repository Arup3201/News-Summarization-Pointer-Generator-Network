Boxing legend Mike Tyson is set to appear in his own, rather bizarre, cartoon show in the Autumn.

The former heavyweight champion of the world has been given his own animation called the Mike Tyson Mysteries which will air on Cartoon Network's Adult swim channel.

With similar animation to popular cartoon Scooby Doo, the adult cartoon shows Tyson solving crimes alongside the ghost of the Marquess of Queensbury and a talking pigeon.

The cartoon was well received as it premiered at this week's Comic-Con event in San Diego.

Besides the cartoon, Tyson has taken a number of acting roles in film and television and appeared in The Hangover back in 2009.
