Chay Lancaster, who died in a walking accident four years ago in the Lake District

The body of a keen hiker lay undiscovered for almost four years after he was killed in a walking accident.

Chay Lancaster, 41, died following an accidental fall in a remote part of the Lake District in September 2010.

Despite a string of extensive searches after he went missing, his body remained unfound until July this year.

Mr Lancaster, of Blackpool, Lancashire, had to be identified from his dental records.

An inquest at Kendal County Hall in Cumbria heard that because of the long delay a pathologist could not give a cause of death.

Mr Lancaster's mother, Judith Lancaster, told the court her son regularly walked the fells on his own.

'We always told him he should tell us where he was going, but he never did, saying nothing will happen to me, walking,' she added.

The family only found out where Mr Lancaster had gone when he went missing as his daughter Elizabeth, who was away at Edinburgh University, returned and looked through his collection of maps and discovered it was one of Little Langdale that had gone missing.

The police began making inquiries on September 23 but, despite Cumbria Police, Lancashire Police, Ambleside and Langdale Mountain Rescue team and search dogs becoming involved, no body was found.

PC Jo Dyson told the inquest that mountain rescue teams made regular searches and always kept Mr Lancaster's disappearance in mind when out on the fells.

It was not until July 28 this year that climbers came across human remains at the bottom of the 535m-high Blake Rigg crags, near Blea Tarn, on the other side of Little Langdale.

It was a remote corner of the fells that not many people walked, PC Dyson said.

A juniper bush was found broken and a rucksack containing Mr Lancaster's property was stuck on a branch.

'Ten metres below that a shoe was found and 20 metres below that were the remains of Mr Lancaster,' PC Dyson added.

Mrs Lancaster said her son had a history of heart problems.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Coroner Ian Smith said: 'Mr Lancaster was off for a day's fell walking. He was not in any trouble. He wasn't trying to lose himself.

'It is impossible to say where he was. He either had a heart attack while on a strenuous walk and consequently fell, or he could just have lost his footing and fell.

'There was a large skull fracture, which the pathologist said could explain his death or have happened after death.

'But on the balance of probabilities, the most likely explanation was simply an accident. Mr Lancaster had lost his footing at a certain point and fell a long way and died outright.'

After the inquest, Mrs Lancaster said: 'He loved fell walking and if he had to die anywhere, it was an appropriate place for it to happen.'
