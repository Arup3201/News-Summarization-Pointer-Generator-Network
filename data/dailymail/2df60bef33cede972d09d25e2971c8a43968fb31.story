A conman who cheated three victims out of thousands of pounds to feed his gambling addiction has walked free from court.

'Flattering' fraudster Craig Johnson was jailed for 10 months for a string of crimes that included burgling a girlfriend's house and stealing the identity of a friend.

But the 26-year-old, described by a judge at Newcastle Crown Court as 'mean' yesterday, is already back on the streets having served his sentence on remand, a situation de`scribed as 'disgraceful' by one of his victims.

The court heard Johnson had broken into the home of girlfriend Jade Lewins in January, stealing her iPad and Barclaycard, which he then used to buy a washing machine costing £427.

Judge Jeremy Freedman said he had charmed Miss Lewins to take out contracts for three mobile phones in his name, racking up costs of £133. He promised to pay her back, but never did.

The serial scam artist stole from another girlfriend, Jodie Clarke, when he offered to take her £300 broken necklace to be repaired. She never saw it again.

Cold-hearted Johnson, who was supported in court by his new wife, also persuaded Miss Clarke to take out a mobile phone contract in his name, but never paid a penny towards the bills.

Johnson then stole the identity of an acquaintance, Joseph Jackson, taking out a £599 loan from the Money Shop in his name.

Mr Jackson was clueless to what had happened when he started receiving payment demands for the loan.

In total, Johnson stole more than £5,500 from his three victims.

When he was arrested in March this year, he was found to be in possession of £900 cash.

Johnson, of Salisbury Street, Blyth, Northumberland, pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud, theft and handling stolen goods.

Defending Johnson, Andrew Mark explained his crimes as being the result of a gambling addiction.

But prosecuting, Alexander Burns said he had been 'charming and flattering'.

Judge Freedman said to Johnson: 'During the summer of last year you behaved as a fraudster, known colloquially as a conman to fund your gambling addiction. These were mean offences.

'You took advantage of the goodwill of people you had met, people who thought they were engaging in a meaningful relationship built on trust. You abused that trust.'

Speaking outside of court, a tearful Jade Lewins said: 'I’m still paying the phone bills now. Five-and-a-half months for ruining my life is disgraceful.

'There has been times when I couldn’t even afford to feed my child because of him.'
