After almost an hour trapped next to fast flowing water Ellie the cocker spaniel was relived to be handed back to the safety of her owner's arms.

Ellie had fallen three metres down slippery banks near Finchdale Priory in Durham while out for a walk.

Firefighters from Durham City were called in and used specialist equipment to pluck the four-year-old pet to safety.

The rescue happened at about 1pm on Wednesday near the former holiday retreat for monks.

It took about 45 minutes and other than being a bit shaken up by the ordeal, Ellie was unharmed.

A spokesman for Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service said: 'It is not a normal rescue, but we don't want the owners putting themselves in danger by trying to rescue the dog.

'We would rather rescue the dog than have to rescue people.

'It is quite rare, but at this time 
of year it is worth mentioning that people walking their dogs need to 
keep an eye on them around frozen lakes and ponds.

'The easiest thing is to keep pets on a lead.'
