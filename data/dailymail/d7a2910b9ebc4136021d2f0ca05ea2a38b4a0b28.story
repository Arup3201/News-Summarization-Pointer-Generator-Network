Travellers living on an illegal campsite are being handed £500 of taxpayers’ money to spend on improving their caravans if they agree to move, it emerged yesterday.

A council is already spending £1.1million on an alternative home for the 15 families currently living on the site.

But despite offering individual plots of land, allotments, a children’s play area, and environmentally friendly features such as composting bins, most of the travellers want to stay where they are.

Changes: A £1.2m plan to transform this illegal 
travellers site at Haldon Hill near Exeter has been scrapped because 
residents have refused to pay council tax

The local authority is now offering them each £500 to spend upgrade their vehicles and caravans as an added incentive to move.

But the move has angered locals who say the handouts come as local services face severe cutbacks and austerity measures.

For the past 12 years Haldon Hill, near Exeter, Devon, has been home to caravans, old buses, huts and shelters housing up to 100 travellers, causing tensions with the local community.

After ten years spent trying to find a solution, Teignbridge District Council won a massive government grant to upgrade facilities and build a legal camp in nearby Haldon Ridge.

It expected travellers to jump at the chance to upgrade to the new-look camp but only a handful of families signed up.

Local campaigner Dudley Swain said the £500 hand-outs would leave council tax payers ‘pretty miffed’.

Barbara Philipson, 71, who has lived in the nearby village of Kennford with her husband John for 26 years, said: ‘The council have made so many cutbacks it’s ridiculous to hand out money like this.

‘I really don’t think it’s going to encourage the travellers to move on.

‘They have tried so many things to move them off the site which have never worked and I’m sure this won’t work either.

Cash: The local council had secured a grant for the site but if the transformation is shelved they may have to pay back the cash

‘They’re just going to profit from this and there’s nothing to say they will actually spend it on their vehicles.’

She added: ‘It’s a beautiful place up there and it’s been absolutely ruined. They have so many orders to move and they never do.

‘They don’t integrate themselves in any way with the community. Nobody goes anywhere near the site which is a shame as it is a beautiful place.

‘I think the council need to reassess the term traveller as several of the men who live on the site work and many of the children have gone to the local school.

‘They don’t conform to rules and regulations like the rest of us.’

The council defended the use of public money saying it would help the new camp progress and enable the old site to be reclaimed more quickly.

Local resident Dudley Swain, 66, said it was unfair for local taxpayers to fund up to £500 per family to move.

He said: ‘I think people are going to be quite annoyed by this [payment] as it is being paid for by the taxpayers.

Closed off: The woodland at Haldon Hill has been used illegally by travellers for twelve years

‘The money should be coming out of the £1.1 million grant that’s already been given.

‘It’s the principle - what will be next? ‘There’s 84 vehicles on that site, 45 which are occupied. The rest have been left there for years and are unoccupied and unmovable.

‘They’ve knocked two acres of trees down in an area that is known for its beauty. Nobody goes up there anymore.

‘My concern is that it could end up being like another Dale Farm with all the hostility which would be a huge shame.’

Another of the site’s neighbours, Doug Priest, 89, said: 'It’s absolutely disgusting up there. I used to have a plot just by the site but I had to sell it as the sewage was coming onto my land. There’s no sanitation - it’s a complete disgrace.’

He added: 'It’s diabolical that the council have agreed to dish out yet more money for them. There are far better things they could be spending the money on.

‘The area used to be lovely, but they’ve completely ruined it with all their broken down buses and rubbish.’

Matthew Sinclair, Chief Executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said last night: ‘Councils are cutting budgets to help deal with the deficit, so it’s not right to dole out cash to do up caravans.

‘Local politicians should be cutting out waste and ensuring that all communities get the quality services they deserve for their Council Tax they pay.’

Teignbridge District Council secured a massive £1.1million government grant earlier this year to pay for the revamped camp.

A nine-month programme of construction began this month to create 15 new pitches next door to the unauthorised site, and will involve tree clearance, installing utilities and clearing debris.

Travellers allocated a pitch in the revamped camp will be required to sign a lease agreement, pay rent and council tax.

Paused: The site was due to have 15 
state-of-the-art eco plots with communal allotments, a children's play 
area, a site manager and environmentally friendly features such as 
composting bins

In return they can look forward to new toilets, showers, power, bin stores and recycling facilities.

Travellers first moved their vehicles on to the pretty woodland setting in August 2001.

It began as a cluster of vehicles but over the next decade slowly morphed into a sprawling mass of huts and shelters, home to around 100 people.

Opponents argued for years that the camp should be cleared and the residents moved on but Teignbridge District Council said the families had laid down roots and their kids attended local schools.

The makeshift dwellings were officially ‘tolerated’ by Devon County Council which owns the land and agreed the community’s welfare outweighed the need to evict them.

When the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) agreed to stump up the cash to revamp the site it was hailed as the first purpose-built new age traveller site in the country.

Officials expected travellers to jump at the chance to stay - with the only condition being they would have to pay rates to contribute to the £40,000 annual running cost.

By June, however, only 11 people had applied to move on to the new camp.

Some had reportedly said they would rather move than sign up to an ‘official existence’.
