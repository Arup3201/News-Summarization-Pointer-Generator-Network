Manchester United defender Paddy McNair says he could have no better education than training against Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao.

The 19-year-old's ambition earlier this season was to establish himself in Warren Joyce's Under 21 side but United's injury crisis forced him to the fore.

McNair's subsequent promotion to the senior group has pitted him against some of the world's most revered attacking players - not least at United's Aon Training Complex.

Playing against the likes of (from left) Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Radamel Falcao can only improve defenders, believes 19-year-old Manchester United centre back Paddy McNair

Talking to Tuesday's edition of United Review, he said: 'It's hard - not great for confidence! But it's obviously really good for me. It's only going to make me a better defender to be playing against world-class strikers every day.

'I'm just looking forward to the season continuing and trying to get better each day. Their goalscoring records speak for themselves, so if I can stop them in training then I must be doing something right.'

McNair doesn't just praise Messrs Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao though. The centre back says United's up-and-coming striker James Wilson is also continuing his rapid development.

'Oh, he's brilliant,' said McNair. 'I think he's got everything. There's nothing he can't do. It's just a matter of time before he gets his first hat-trick at Old Trafford! He works really hard and it's a real challenge to face him in training.'

McNair is in Tuesday's squad to face Stoke City but Chris Smalling and Marcos Rojo are expected to continue their partnership at the back.

United are looking for another experienced centre back but do not expect to get the men they want in January.

Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is an option but his coach Diego Simeone may yet persuade the player to follow him on his next coaching project.

Hector Moreno of Espanyol has also been offered to United.

Meanwhile, Angel di Maria has a small tear in his hamstring. The injury was confirmed by his wife on Instagram.
