The residents of two Long Island homes were woken at 3.30am on Sunday by a calamitous crashing noise as large and heavy debris of some kind fell through both their roofs.

Neighbours Lois Farella and Anne Grace of Valley Stream now have gaping holes in their roofs the cause of which is believed to be frozen waste - known as 'blue ice' - that most likely leaked from a passing aircraft.

The FAA is investigating the possibility that a plane's faulty sewage tank might be responsible for the damage done to the shingles, the plywood and even the layer of insulation of the houses.

'It's a very huge hole. It did a lot of damage through heavy wood. I can't imagine if it hit a person,' Ms Grace told CBS of the destruction caused on her home.

Her elderly neighbour who now has a basketball-sized hole in her own roof, recalled: 'We both woke up to a very loud bang. I looked around - no breeze, no rain, nothing.'

Roofer Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet, brown stain inside the attic below the large fissure in Ms Grace's roof and said he couldn't imagine what, other than something from a plane, could have fallen that hard and fast. 

Valley Stream sits just north east of John F Kennedy airport so planes probably fly overhead frequently.

Crater: The hole in Lois Farella's roof is roughly the shape of a basketball

Debris: Whatever came through the roof penetrated not only shingles but plywood and insulation too so must have been heavy or dropped from a great height

'That's a lot of blunt force that did 
that [and it] was coming from a distance. It blew through and inch and a
half of shingles and those shingles are tough,' he remarked.

But the FAA claims on its website that reports of such incidents are rarely anything at all to do with air traffic and that brown stains could easily be attributed to large groups of migrating birds laying waste en route.

In a fact sheet the Federal Aviation Administration address a list of what it refers to as 'myths' surrounding the subject, debunking the notion that planes routinely dump sewage in mid-flight.

'Manufacturers take great care to ensure this holding tank is secure,' it reads. 'It's physically impossible for a pilot to dump a tank while in flight. The apparatus to access the tank is located on the exterior of the plane.

Mystery: The FAA are investigating but say that reports of such incidents are rarely anything to do with aeroplane waste as often as they are the migrating birds dropping feces

Hygiene: Aeroplane bathrooms like this one use a blue coloured deodorising chemical in the toilet bowl that also breaks down solids

'That exterior lever means only the ground crew can operate the valve that opens the tank while the plane is on the ground.

'Even if the tank were to break it goes on, 'blue ice', named for the colour of the disinfectant liquid in plane toilet bowls, would not land in solid form.

'Modern commercial aircraft cruise at high altitudes, and the sub-zero temperatures will cause any liquid to freeze immediately, hence the term "Blue Ice,"' the site clarifies before adding,  'If any of this "Blue Ice" were to fall from an aircraft, it would melt long before it hit the ground, dissipating into miniscule droplets that are nearly invisible.'

According to the FAA, phone calls claiming to report craters caused by 'blue ice' increase dramatically around Fall when birds begin to migrate.

Conclusions: Roofer, Bryan Lanzello discovered a wet, brown stain inside the attic below the large frissure in Ms Grace's roof and said he couldn't imagine what else could have caused the damage

Home sweet home: The FAA will check to see if any planes passed over Anne Grace's Valley Streams neighbourhood on Sunday night

No shelter here: Lois Farella says now she has been told she has to get an entirely new roof which could cost thousands of dollars

'Bird migration also occurs during a time when fruit trees are ripening,' claims the FAA in a final attempt to put claims of falling feces to rest.  'As the fruit goes through a bird's digestive system it loses none of its color, which means if it was blue going in, it will be blue coming out.'

Authorities, have been looking into what might have caused the damage in Long Island and comparing the timing to the flight schedule over the area on Sunday night.

If there were planes passing overhead at 3.30 am then they will have to investigate further to find out which airline may be at fault for having a tank in disrepair.

An FAA spokesman said that at this time, the case was 'inclusive'.

Arlene Salac told MailOnline: We couldn't determine if it was blue ice as radar tracks from the area showed there were no planes overhead at the time the residents said the debris fell.

'The nearest plane was three miles away. There is no blue residue and no sign of aircraft parts around the house. Unless it happened at a different time of day or we get more information we cannot tell what happened'

FAA officials are investigating but say it's more likely due to migrating birds

Roofer says impact penetrated shingles and plywood so must have fallen from very high
