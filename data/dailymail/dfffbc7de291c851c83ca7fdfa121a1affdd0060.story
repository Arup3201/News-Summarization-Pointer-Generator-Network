John Terry was stripped of the England captaincy for the second time yesterday and a number of team-mates believe he should not be picked by Fabio Capello while allegations of racism persist.

The decision, taken by the 14 members of the FA board, was  communicated first to Capello on Thursday night and then to Terry at 10am yesterday in a call from FA chairman David Bernstein. The news was broken by Mail Online.

Terry faces trial on July 9, having been accused of a racially aggravated public-order offence against Anton Ferdinand. Terry denies the charge, but the FA have decided it would be inappropriate to let the 31-year-old Chelsea defender lead England at this summer’s European Championship.

Given the boot: John Terry has been stripped of the England captaincy - for the second time - because he faces criminal charges over allegations he racially abused QPR defender Anton Ferdinand

On a dramatic day…

Losing the England armband has left the defender considering retirement from international football, and Sportsmail understands Terry was made aware a number of his black England team-mates had an issue with him — over his clash with Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road on October 23 — during their last get-together.

Yesterday, former Fulham striker Leroy Rosenior became the latest black football figure to speak out against Terry — joining Jason Roberts and Emmanuel Frimpong.

TV pundit Rosenior told the BBC: ‘They have made the right decision. I just found it incredible that John could think he could lead England into the European Championship. I don’t even think he should go to Euro 2012 — I don’t think it would be good for the team.’

Terry, stripped of the captaincy two years ago amid the controversy of his affair with Vanessa Perroncel and Sportsmail’s revelation that the Wembley box he was given at a discounted rate was being offered on the black market, is said to feel betrayed by the FA.

But he may also feel it is difficult to face hostility in the dressing room when he is no longer skipper. The decision to delay his trial  until July 9 makes it additionally complicated for him.

The FA made the unprecedented move of cancelling the pre-match handshake at last Saturday’s FA Cup tie between QPR and Chelsea because Ferdinand and his team-mates were planning to snub Terry and it is believed Manchester United players, with Rio Ferdinand among them, were planning to do the same at Stamford Bridge tomorrow before Terry was withdrawn through injury.

The issue is a nightmare for Capello. He reinstated Terry as captain a year ago, ignoring warnings that the move could come back to bite him. Now he has lost his captain in chaotic circumstances for the second successive tournament, and is left with problems when it comes to appointing a replacement.

After the way Capello handled replacing Rio Ferdinand with Terry last year, it is no surprise that the United defender does not want the job. He tweeted yesterday: ‘I don’t want to be England captain after the last episode, just want to concentrate on playin for utd & if I make the squad then as ever I’ll be delighted.’

Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard is the right man if he is fit and in form. He captained England at the 2010 World Cup and handled his media responsibilities extremely well. But concerns over Gerrard’s fitness do not make him the automatic choice, even if Capello (right) would prefer to go with one of the senior players.

Barry is a major candidate, with the likelihood Jack Wilshere will miss the tournament through injury making the Manchester City man’s place in the side more secure.

Beyond that, Capello may well consider Tottenham’s Parker; an experienced club captain and someone now among the first  players on the England team sheet despite missing out on World Cup selection.

Frank Lampard could also be a contender if he can prove himself worthy of a place in England’s first XI.

Wayne Rooney would have been considered had he not been suspended for the first two games in Poland and Ukraine. Ashley Cole would be a reluctant skipper and Joe Hart, while a certainty to start every game, is likely to be dismissed on the grounds he is too young.

Capello, while accepting the FA’s right to strip Terry of the captaincy, is far from happy. The decision has been taken while he is in Italy and his stance on Terry has not changed. The manager made a recent visit to Chelsea’s training ground just to see Terry.

But Bernstein and the FA board have made the correct call. They have to consider the public image of the England team. It is believed they stopped short of suspending Terry from international football altogether because it would set  a dangerous precedent ahead of  Terry’s case at Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

An FA statement read: ‘Following the decision to adjourn the court case against John Terry to July, the FA confirm he will not captain the England team until the allegations against him are resolved.

‘The FA board expected the trial to be concluded prior to the European Championship. Further to Wednesday’s confirmation that the trial will not take place until after the tournament, the board has  collectively decided it is in the interests of all parties that John has the responsibilities of captaincy removed at this time.

‘This decision has been taken due to the higher profile nature of the captaincy, on and off the pitch, and the demands and requirements expected of the captain leading into and during a tournament.

‘The FA board can confirm that he has not been excluded from the squad and that Fabio Capello is free to select him for the Holland fixture on February 29 and the European Championship.

‘FA chairman David Bernstein has spoken to John Terry and Fabio Capello to explain the facts to them. Fabio Capello has not been involved in the FA board discussions which reached this conclusion, but understands that the FA board has authority to make this decision.

‘Fabio Capello will take the decision as to who will be made captain moving forward.

‘This decision in no way infers any suggestion of guilt in relation to  the charge made against John Terry. The FA will not be making any further comment on this matter.’

Steven Gerrard is the odds-on favourite to take John Terry's armband for the Euro 2012 opener, according to Ladbrokes.

The Liverpool skipper is a warm 2/5 favourite to take over from Terry should he be stripped of captaincy, with Joe Hart next in at 5/1.

Hart's teammate Gareth Barry earns an 8/1 quote while Chelsea's Frank Lampard and Ashley Cole are outsiders at 20/1 and 33/1 respectively.

Terry is also now odds-on (8/11) to not start the opening match against France.

Alex Donohue of Ladbrokes said: 'Gerrard appears the obvious choice with the odds reflecting that.

'Should the armband be passed to another Chelsea player punters will be in for a bumper payday.'
