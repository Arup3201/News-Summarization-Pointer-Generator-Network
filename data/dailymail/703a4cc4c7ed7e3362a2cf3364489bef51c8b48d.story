Rev Aubel has revealed witchcraft is thriving across rural parishes in Wales in his autobiography

A church minister has revealed witchcraft is very much alive and well in his Welsh rural parishes as he warns against becoming involved in the occult.

Reverend Felix Aubel has spoken of how he has come across witches, the use of effigies and the 'evil eye' during his career in the Welsh countryside.

He has detailed a number of spine-tingling tales after the latest figures in the 2011 census revealed 83 witches and 93 satanists are living in Wales.

Rev Aubel, who is the minister of five Congregational chapels in rural Carmarthenshire, even detailed how he had to call out an exorcist after a witch placed a curse on one of his parishioners.

He said: 'This is not a joke and I would warn people not to get involved in the occult.

'I have been told that a coven of witches still meet locally.

'There is also a witch living in a nearby village who advertises her services in the local paper.'

In his autobiography, Rev Aubel describes how a curse on a parishioner had to be lifted by an exorcist after a 'poppet' or 'effigy' was made of a chapel member of his.

He said: 'In folk-magic and witchcraft, a poppet is a doll made to represent a person, for casting spells on that person.

'A poppet or effigy would be used with very sharp needles stuck into its 'heart' as a way of doing evil to an enemy.

'It was this evil type of poppet that was used on a chapel member of mine in the Aberaeron area in 1994.

'It took an experienced Anglican exorcist to 'raise' this curse, which had been placed by a witch on the instruction of another former church member.

'The motivation behind this 'evil' was envy that had turned into jealousy.'

Rev Aubel wrote the book, called A Rebel's Story, to act as a warning to people not to get entangle in the occult.

The Carmarthenshire church minister, who has preached in West Wales for over 20 years, also said he had battled a case of the 'evil eye' which left a mother and her young child needing hospital treatment.

He said: 'This is an ancient belief in the existence of a malevolent power in the glance of some people, which is almost invariably provoked by envy or jealousy.

'In this instance, a lady who had given birth to a baby boy was apparently wished bad luck by the "evil glance" in the eye of a childless spinster neighbour.

The church minister has told of how he had to call out an exorcist, similar to the 1973 classic film, after a parishioner was cursed by a witch

'Both mother and child were subsequently taken ill due to acute breathlessness for no apparent medical reason and had to be hospitalised.

'The spinster even visited the mother and child in hospital while I was speaking to them.

'It became obvious to me that the spinster was praising the baby to its mother in a very false and patronising way.'

Rev Aubel said he had come across witches during his time as a minister, while the exorcist had to be called after an effigy, or poppet, was made of a chapel member of his

This is one of the most noticeable characteristics of the utilisation of the "evil eye".

'Realising this, I asked the spinster to say "God bless you" to the baby, having just said what a beautiful child the mother had.

'After that the spinster immediately walked away without uttering another word.'

Rev Aubel said the mother later placed a horse shoe amulet in the porch of her home as a precautionary measure to protect her son and herself from the effects of the 'evil eye'.
