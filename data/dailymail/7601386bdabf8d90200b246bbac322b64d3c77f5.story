An eight-year-old boy with a severe heart condition used his one wish granted by a charity to take his father to a racing track.

Rhys Evans has endured two life-saving operations in his eight years to stem a hole in his heart.

Despite doctors' attempts to fit artificial valves when he was just five months old, he has now outgrown them - forcing him back into the operating theatre.

One and only wish: Eight-year-old Rhys Evans was told he could pick the experience of a lifetime after undergoing his second open-heart operation. He asked to pay for his father, Darryl, to race at Silverstone

Selfless: Rhys was born with leaking heart valves but the hardest thing to deal with was his father's return the the front line in Afghanistan. Darryl (pictured right at Camp Bastion) was amazed by the surprise outing

In a bid to console him after his latest six-hour open-heart surgery, a charity offered to give him the experience of a lifetime.

But, incredibly, the little boy shunned options to meet celebrities or take a holiday - instead choosing a day at Silverstone with his father Darryl, 33.

Mr Evans, an army sergeant, said he couldn't believe it when Rhys, beaming, revealed the surprise.

The father-of-three said: 'I had no idea until the morning and it was just so touching.

'When there have been times in your life when you truly don’t know if you are ever going to see your child smile again, you just cherish the happy moments you have.

'There have been plenty of very hard times, so for Rhys to choose this for me was absolutely brilliant.

Full of life: Mr and Mrs Evans said Rhys is still recovering but bounded around telling everyone about his dad

Idol: Rhys idolises his father and excitedly helped him prepare for his race last week

Super car: Mr Evans, 33, got behind the wheel of an Aston Martin at the home of the British Grand Prix

'Just to have five or six hours, as a family, where we didn’t have to worry about anything was just such a weight off our shoulders. It was brilliant.'

Rhys was born with congenital heart defect Fallots syndrome which meant his heart valves leaked, reducing the oxygen travelling round his body.

It made him weak - and at times blue.

Despite undergoing surgery as a baby, and making a good recovery, he grew out of the artificial valves he was fitted with and had to have a valve transplant operation last February at Great Ormond Street hospital.

But for Rhys, the hardest thing to cope with was the news that his father had to return to the front line in Afghanistan for six months just a few weeks after his operation - while he was still undergoing regular appointments.

Ideal: Rhys could have chosen to meet a celebrity but he seemed ecstatic parading around Silverstone

Family: Rhys shared the experience with his mother, Veronica, and his sisters Jessica (centre) and Niamh

When wish-granting charity Rays of Sunshine told Rhys, from Aldershot, Hampshire, he could have any wish in the world, he did not hesitate to get his dad involved.

The family watched Mr Evans’s Aston Martin skid driving experience at Silverstone Circuit, funded by card company Clintons.

Rhys's mother, Veronica, 33, watched from the sidelines with Rhys and his sisters Jessica, 10, and Niamh, five.

Rhys said: 'The car went really fast round the track lots of times. I used to feel ill but now I feel good. Daddy had a very good time and so did I. It was fun. It was cool watching him.'

Returned: Darryl, who came back from Afghanistan in January, hugs Rhys at the end of his race last week

Mrs Evans, a nurse, said: 'Rhys idolises his dad so while it was hard on us all when he had to go to Afghanistan, but really hard on Rhys. His dad is his hero.

'I was so proud of him when he chose to have the treat for his dad. Darryl works so hard and it meant the world to us to have a family day away.'

Jane Sharpe, CEO of Rays of Sunshine Children’s Charity, said: 'Every day of the year the charity gives brave and deserving young people the chance to do something they have previously only dreamed of.

'Rhys’ admiration for his dad has helped him get through the challenges of his illness and he wanted to do something extra special for Father’s Day this year, to thank him being such an amazing dad.

'We are so grateful to Clinton’s for their ongoing support and for helping us to celebrate extraordinary fathers across the UK, by granting this ‘reverse wish’ for Darren.'
