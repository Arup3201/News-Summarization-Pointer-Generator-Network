Police forces are using Twitter accounts intended to help fight crime to follow  gossip about hundreds of celebrities.

The official accounts were found to follow the tweets of pop stars, sportsmen, fashion designers and TV shows.

And although Twitter is free to use, many forces employ dedicated social media staff – funded by taxpayers – who are paid to monitor and maintain the accounts.

Among the celebrities followed by police forces were Victoria Beckham, Rihanna, Simon Cowell, Lady Gaga and Downton Abbey.

Scotland Yard ordered a clean-up of its official Twitter pages after receiving a formal complaint from a victim of crime. 

Since then police in Lambeth, south London, have deleted more than 500 links which were not work-related.

Before
 the clear-out, the force’s account would have been swamped by hundreds 
of posts each day from celebrities they were following.

Last
 night the crime victim who complained said she felt ‘sickened’ when she
 discovered the police were ‘wasting hours entertaining themselves about
 the exploits of celebrities’.

More
 than £2million of taxpayers' money has been spent to allow police 
workers to the listen to the radio at work, it has emerged.

While
 forces in England and Wales have been hit sweeping budget cuts, the 
incredible sum has been spent over the past three years for workplace 
music licenses.

Fees being spent include £60 for every patrol car and £54 for offices where music may just be played in the background.

Larger areas such as canteens and staff sports clubs can be charged thousands of pounds, reports The Sun.

The
 biggest spender is the Metropolitan Police, which shells out £250,000 a
 year. West Midlands Police came next, spending £62,000, while Thames 
Valley was third on £44,000.

Several
 forces pay £25,000 a year but many pay nothing because their leaders 
refuse to pay money to the Performing Rights Society, which collects 
royalties for composers, songwriters and publishers.

The
 total annual £670,000 cost - revealed in Freedom of Information Act 
responses - comes as thousand of frontline jobs have been axed to meet 
budget cuts of millions of pounds.

Conservative
 MP Priti Patel said: 'Taxpayers' money should be used to investigate 
crime and bring offenders to justice rather than pay for police officers
 to listen to pop music. Police and Crime Commissioners must scrap this 
perk and invest in putting bobbies on the beat.'

South
 Yorkshire Police insisted the £70,000 it spent in three yeasrs was 
worth the cash because music is good for 'staff wellbeing'.

The
 39-year-old woman, who was mugged in south London last month, said: ‘I 
feel horrified that police staff are whiling away their time ogling 
Rihanna or getting the latest on Simon Cowell, when the local streets 
aren’t safe.’

Social media has been embraced by the police as a way to improve its image, particularly among young people.

Forces
 are encouraged to use Twitter to ‘engage’ with communities, post 
updates about crimes and to appeal for information and witnesses.

Guidance
 from the Association of Chief Police Officers states that ‘the use of 
social media for private purposes during working time and from force 
systems should be in accordance with local force policies’ and is ‘not 
recommended’.

Police in 
Solihull follow Cricket Australia, which offers ‘all the latest breaking
 Aussie cricket news’ as well as Danny Baker, the BBC broadcaster.

Leicestershire
 Police follows Coleen Rooney, wife of England footballer Wayne and 
comedian Miranda Hart.

Gordon Scobbie, a former officer who advises on 
digital strategy, said: ‘I can understand following some politicians, 
celebrities with a cause, or perhaps local celebrities, but not Rihanna 
and Justin Bieber.’

Staffordshire
 Police claimed they follow famous figures to ‘deal with alleged 
offences against them’ or encourage them to post police appeals.

Robert
 Oxley, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Taxpayers would rather pay 
for bobbies on the beat than police staff who tweet.’
