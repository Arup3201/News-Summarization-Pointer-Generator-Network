Withdrawn: Chris Langham was due to appear at a question and answer session at Tonbridge School

Disgraced actor Chris Langham has cancelled an appearance at a top public school after parent fury about his child porn conviction.

The sex offender, 62, was expected to host a question and answer session after his new comedy Black Pond was screened.

But after a concerned parent contacted the school the actor pulled out of the event at the £31,000-per-year Tonbridge School in Kent.

The evening - listed in promotional material sent out last week - was being organised by the parents' arts society at the school's theatre.

Married father-of-five Langham was jailed for three months in 2007 for downloading images of child abuse.

He downloaded the graphic footage on four separate occasions. Some of the videos were rated at level five - depicting the very worst child abuse. The footage was so repulsive that during his trial a juror was physically ill after viewing it.

The Bafta-winning star of BBC sitcom The Thick of It claimed he downloaded 15 images of child abuse as he 'researched' one of his roles.

He was originally jailed for ten months but on appeal his legal team successfully argued that his sentence had been 'very tough' and he was released after 
serving three months in Elmley Prison in Kent.

The actor lives with his wife Christine Cartwright in Cranbrook, Kent, close to the respected school. He is on the sex offenders' register for at least another two years.

After being released from hail, he said: 'My life has been ruined but my conscience is clear.'

Before his conviction Langham, who also starred in Kiss Me Kate and was a founding 
member of the Not The Nine O’Clock News team, was lauded as one of the leading comic actor/writers of his era.

A spokeswoman for the school said that the shamed actor had withdrawn and the event on March 16 which will instead feature the film's two directors Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley instead.

She said: 'Chris Langham has let us know that he is now not able to attend.'

They denied there would have been any risk to children if the actor had attended the parents-only event.

'Tonbridge School have been working with the Multi Agency Public Protection Team in Kent,' she said.

'The assessment in 2007 was there should be no restrictions placed on Mr Langham with regard to unsupervised access to children under the age of 16 and that he is no risk / low risk to children.'

She said the school had received only one complaint about the event.

Tonbridge School, which charges fees higher than Eton, has 800 boys aged 13 to 18 and is set in 150 acres of Kent countryside and was founded in 1553.

They list Sir Peter Tapsell, who is currently the longest-serving MP, historian Dr Anthony Seldon, ITV director Peter Fincham and novelist Frederick Forsyth among their alumni.

Black Pond, which also stars comedian Simon Amstell, provided Langham with his first acting job since his release from prison.

The actor plays the patriarch of a family who is falsely accused of murder in the dark comedy.

The cast have toured the country to promote the film with talks and other actors have appeared in schools.

Parents' fury: Langham pulled out of the event at the £31,000-per-year Tonbridge School, Kent, after a complaint was received, a spokeswoman confirmed

The comedian and actor has 
made several public apologies for downloading illegal images - and has said he wants to get back to work.

Derek Green, director of leading child protection agency Ray Wyre Associates, said it was a 'daft' decision to invite a convicted sex offender into a school.

'It does seem a bizarre choice of entertainment to invite Chris Langham into the school,' he said.

'It's not likely anything untoward is going to happen and the school would put the appropriate safeguards in place but it is inappropriate. He is a man who is still trying to justify his behaviour in viewing child pornography.

'There are so many other people who could appear at an event like this that doesn't involve bringing a convicted sex offender into the school.

'It is good news in one sense that parents have complained but one would have to question what on earth someone was thinking when they decided to invite Chris Langham in the first place.'

In an article for The Independent in 
October, the film's directors Will Sharpe and Tom Kingsley defended 
their decision to cast Mr Langham.

They wrote: 'Chris was in fact 
someone who had made a mistake, who had paid the price and who should be
allowed to move on.'

Other speakers who have appeared at Tonbridge School for parents' events include John Simpson, Lord Hurd and Ian Hislop.
