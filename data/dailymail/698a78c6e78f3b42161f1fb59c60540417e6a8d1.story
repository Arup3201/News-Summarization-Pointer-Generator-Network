Wealthy Middle Eastern clients were supplied with prostitutes during the Cannes Film Festival, a French court has heard.

The women formed part of a high-class prostitution network and escorts, models and beauty queens were all hired to entertain men at luxury hotels, grand villas and yachts in France.

Seven men and a woman went on trial in the southern port city of Marseille, though the five chief figures are on the run and are being tried in absentia.

The court heard the vice ring was 'gigantic' and that the women had been promised to 'rich princes from the Middle East,' reported the Guardian.

Ring: Wealthy Middle Eastern clients were supplied with prostitutes during the Cannes film festival, a French court was told

Elie Nahas, a 
48-year-old Lebanese businessman was fined 50,000 euro ($64,000) for his role.

Accusations: Nahas is accused of organising a birthday party for Mutassim Gaddafi, the playboy son of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi

He did not appear at the  trial, but the court heard Nahas helped recruit and supply escorts 
to a client list that included 'sons of presidents, Arab princes,' and
 Muammar Gaddafi's playboy son Mutassim reported the New York Daily News.

His Style modelling agency based in Beirut was allegedly a cover for the prostitution ring. 

Nahas is accused of organising a birthday party for Mutassim Gaddafi.

The party allegedly cost 1.1 million euros (£900,000) and celebrities invited included Kevin Costner and Carmen Electra, the website reported.

Mutassim Gaddafi was killed with his father on October 20 last year.

Prosecutor Damien Martinelli described Nahas as a 'businessman dealing in prostitution.'

Mr Arddi said Nahas's 'enviable' address 
book contained phone numbers for 'the Gaddafi family and several sons of 
presidents and Arab princes'.

Patrick Ardid, the president of the 
court, said the women's services were paid for by 'businesses … and 
sometimes the Libyan embassy,' reported the Guardian.

A Venezuelan named Felix Farias, who worked for a branch of Nahas's 
agency got a 
three-year jail sentence of which two were suspended.

The court heard Farias caused a 
scandal in May 2007 when he arrived at Charles de Gaulle airport in 
Paris while the Cannes festival was on, accompanied by eight females, 
one of whom was a minor and they were refused entry.

'The event [arrest] caused panic in Cannes,' Patrick Ardid, the president of the court, said.

'Those really responsible are absent or have fled,' said Franck De Vita, the lawyer for Samari. 

One of the accused who did not turn up 
at court is Micheal Orsowitz, a Miami resident, who is in custody in Britain
 contesting his extradition.

The others got terms ranging from three to six years.
