If you thought litter had become an intolerable problem on your commute, spare a thought for these travellers.

Passengers venturing on to the trains in China's biggest cities have been forced to wade ankle deep through a sea of rubbish strewn across the carriages.

Discarded food, crisp packets, old bits of fruit are left to fester on the floor.

The problem has reached epic proportions ahead of the Chinese New Year as these photographs show.

Millions of people have been taking to the country's already crowded railways to head home before the celebrations tomorrow.

And many of the passengers appear to find it pointless to seek out one of the overflowing rubbish bins.

Instead, they have taken to discarding their litter onto the pile collecting on the floor on this service between Shenzhen to Zhengzhou.

You'll need a bigger brush: A cleaner uses a tiny dustpan and brush to clear up some of the mess on the Shenzhen to Zhengzhou service during the peak travel season

Hard-pressed cleaners have the unenviable task of performing regular sweeps of the carriages in a bid to get on top of the problem.

Passengers stand on their seats to avoid the cleaner's brush during one of the clear ups.

About
 3.62 billion trips will be made during the 40-day Spring Festival 
travel rush which started from January 16, an official said, Xinhua News
 Agency reported.
