This million dollar bike made out of solid gold is certainly set to 'brake' someone's bank account.

The cycle, which also boasts an alligator-hide seat and a stingray-skin water bottle has gone on the market for a hefty $1million (Â£600,000).

The one of a kind mountain bike made from 24-carat gold has been created by The House of Solid Gold, a U.S. company based in California.

The flash two-wheeler is covered almost entirely in gold, and comes complete with a customized seat cover crafted from brown alligator hide, as well as a unique water bottle coated in solid gold and decorated with stingray skin.

It took a painstaking 750 hours to handcraft the elaborate bike, which also features the artist's signature.

But buyers are being warned if they want to get their hands on the unique bike, they will have to be quick as there are only plans to create another 12 of the bicycles.

With solid gold pedals, gears and chain, it is no surprise that the bike has been valued at $1million

Hugh Power, CEO of House of Solid Gold, said: 'The idea came about while I was extreme mountain biking on a similar bike.

'It was during this ride that the idea was born to build a gold bike, customised with all the latest hi-tech gear.

'But the true challenge I faced was to make sure that the bike would be ridable.

'This is the only gold bike in existence. And there will only be 13 made in total with each one being custom built and totally unique in its own right.'

But despite the high price-tag, potential buyers might be happy to know proceeds from the bike will go to a good cause.

The 57-year-old entrepreneur added: "The price tag on the bike is only so high because most - if not all - of the proceeds will be donated to charity.

'The Way to Happiness Foundation is a global non-profit, non-religious charitable organisation that do a lot of impressive work to combat crime and violence worldwide.

'And buying the bike is more a way for the affluent who want to donate their money to a great worldly cause, and receive the bike as a token.'

The bike took a painstaking 750 hours to handcraft and a total of only 13 will be made
