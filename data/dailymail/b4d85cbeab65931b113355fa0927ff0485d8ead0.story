Two brothers have been jailed for a raft of sexual offences including pimping out young girls to workers at a curry house for £150 sex sessions.

Ahdel Ali, 24, was sentenced to 18 years in prison, while his 29-year-old brother Mubarek was handed a 14-year-term by Judge Patrick Thomas QC at Worcester Crown Court.

During the brothers' trial the court heard that the two men systematically groomed young girls for after hour sex sessions at the restaurant.

The Ali brothers, both of Regent Street, Wellington, denied a total of 24 offences, including controlling child prostitution, people trafficking and sexual exploitation.

Ahdel Ali, known as Eddie, was also accused of rape and sexual activity with a child.

The abuse was committed against four girls between March 2008 and December 2009.

Mubarek Ali denied four counts of controlling child prostitution, two of trafficking within the UK for sexual exploitation, and one of causing child prostitution between March 2008 and December 2009.

His brother denied three charges of controlling child prostitution, 11 of sexual activity with a child, two of inciting child prostitution, one of meeting a child following sexual grooming, one of inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and a count of rape alleged to have been committed between June and September 2008.

'We are satisfied with the sentences handed down at court today and are pleased these two men will now serve significant custodial sentences,' West Mercia Police detective chief inspector Neil Jamieson said.

'Ahdel Ali and Mubarek Ali targeted these girls because of their vulnerability and then systematically groomed them in such a way that eventually they could exploit them sexually for their own gain and gratification.'

Jamieson added that the trial had been an ordeal for the victims who gave evidence.

'I would like to pay tribute to the strength and character shown by all of the victims who came and gave evidence,' he said. 'It has been very challenging for these young women to come forward and give their evidence and I hope that these convictions will go some way to help them move on with their future lives.

'I would also like to thank my team of dedicated officers and staff who worked very hard to bring these men to justice.'

During the trial, Stafford Crown Court heard the pair groomed two teenage girls for sex before persuading them to work as prostitutes for them four years ago.

One of the victims, now aged 19, told the court she and her friend were driven to the Dhaka Tandoori restaurant in Wellington, Telford, Shropshire, after hours.

The woman, giving evidence behind a screen, told the court: 'Two of the men took my friend into a bedroom. It was after the restaurant was closed and there were three men in rooms upstairs.'

She said she went into one room where she found her friend having sex with one of the men. Another man asked her to have sex, she said, but she refused and instead performed a sex act on him.

She told the court: 'I felt I had to do it. I didn’t want to do it.'

When the girls left the restaurant they found the Ali brothers taking drugs and drinking in their car, the jury heard.

The girl told the court: 'They were just laughing. They thought it was funny because we had to do it and they got money for it.'

Earlier the court heard the girl met the brothers when she was 15. She said that they befriended her but when she turned 16 she was forced to have sex with men up to four times a week.
