John Lu, who spread an infection that led to five hospital deaths, will not be compelled to inform NHS patients of his history

A cardiac surgeon who spread an infection that led to five deaths in hospital will not be compelled to inform NHS patients of his history, the High Court ruled today.

John Lu claimed that if he was forced to disclose his past to patients, it would render ‘his return to any meaningful practice as a cardiac surgeon impossible’.

The surgeon passed on a bug during heart valve surgery between December 2008 and July 2010 at the Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust.

The outbreak of PVE (Prosthetic Value Endocarditis) a serious heart surgery complication, was found by a coroner to stem from Mr Lu’s habit of swapping gloves during operations.

Of 28 heart patients who had valves inserted by him, 11 had fallen ill.

Dennis Mills, 82, Michael Smithers, 67, Bernard Heald, 83, Alan Daniels, 73 and Albert Rigley, 63, all died after contracting the staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria.

The bug is carried on the skin, but only becomes deadly if it attaches to a foreign body, such as an artificial heart valve.

Although Mr Lu has been ‘demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 May 2010’, he argues that Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust have imposed harsh and disproportionate conditions on his return to work, including compulsory disclosure of his involvement in the scandal.

Mr Justice Lewis said the decision whether to inform patients of Lu’s past was ‘ultimately' a matter for the Trust to determine.

He said in his judgment: ‘The Trust has been working very sensibly towards a strategy which will inform the potential patients, the public, and other bodies, such as those who refer patients to the Centre, about the return of Mr Lu to surgical duties.

‘In my judgment, that is sensible and does not involve a breach of any express or implied contractual term for at least the following reasons.

‘First and foremost, patients and potential patients who may learn about Mr Lu’s return to work need to be reassured that that creates no unacceptable risk and that the arrangements for re-integration are robust.

‘Given the severity of the 2008 and 2009 outbreak, and the deaths that followed, that is sensible.

‘Secondly, the families of those who died and those who were infected but survived also have an interest in knowing that Mr Lu is to return to surgery and the circumstances in which that is to take place.

‘Thirdly, it is sensible from Mr Lu’s perspective. His return to surgical duties, given the circumstances of the outbreak, may be expected to generate media and public interest.

‘It is better that the Trust is prepared to deal, so far as it can, with such interest.

‘Fourthly, those who refer patients to the Centre, or who have other connections with it, may legitimately have an interest in Mr Lu’s return to work.

‘Ultimately, the communication strategy is a matter for the Trust to determine.

‘The Trust, as employer, considers that Mr Lu presents no greater risk of infection than any other cardiac surgeon and there is no requirement, from the employer’s perspective, to require any individual surgeon or clinician to provide additional information over and above that which the individual clinician considers, in the exercise of his clinical judgment, should be provided to enable the patient to give informed consent to any proposed surgery.

‘Individual surgeons and clinicians will therefore have to determine what information, in respect of which types of surgery, they can or should provide to their patients.

‘This judgment does not, and is not intended to, influence the exercise of clinical judgment by any surgeon as to what information should be provided to patients.’

Mr Lu had claimed the Trust’s demands were ‘inaccurate, incomplete and misleading' as to the nature of the risk of a PVE infection and the comparative risk posed by Mr Lu and his other consultant colleagues respectively’.

He has been ‘demonstrably free of the outbreak since 26 May 2010’.

Mr Lu remains happy to ‘provide full information about the outbreak and his involvement in it to any patient who asks’.

The surgeon failed in his claim for ‘loss and damage by reason of the Trust’s breach of contract’.
