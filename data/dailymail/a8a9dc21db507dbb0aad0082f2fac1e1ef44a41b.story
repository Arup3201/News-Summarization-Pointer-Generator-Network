It's a cafe that offers all-you-can-eat biscuits, endless cups of tea and unlimited WiFi.

The only catch? You have to pay for your stay. The UK’s first pay-per-minute cafe Ziferblat, which means clock face in Russian, charges customers 3p for every minute they spend inside.

When guests arrive at the East London cafe they take a clock from the cupboard and keep it with them until they leave.

They then make their own coffee or prepare food – and sometimes even wash their own dishes.

Utopian: The idea is to create a 'free space' where customers are treated more like 'micro-tenants'

The model has already proven popular in Russia, where Ziferblat’s owner, Ivan Mitin, owns nine other branches and welcomes 30,000 customers a month.

The cafe has been described as more of a social experiment born out of the owner’s utopian dream.

The idea is to create a ‘free space’ where customers are treated more like ‘micro-tenants’, as opposed to customers.

During their visit, they can make their own coffee from the professional machine and prepare their own food in the kitchen or have it made for them.

The London branch of Ziferblat, in trendy Old Street, is furnished with unusual furniture, an antique piano, and a selection of books.

Mr Mitin said during the first month of the UK opening, they have already drawn in some regulars.

He said yesterday: ‘Londoners are more prepared for such a concept; they understand the idea instantly.

'It’s funny to see people queuing here to wash their dishes. It’s not obligatory, but it’s appreciated.

‘They even wash each other’s dishes. It’s very social. We think of our guests as micro tenants, all sharing the same space.’
