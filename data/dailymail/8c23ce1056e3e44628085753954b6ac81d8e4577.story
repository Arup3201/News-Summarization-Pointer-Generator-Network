Most landlords prepare themselves for some less-than-appealing personal remnants when a tenant leaves, so when this man found more than £600,000 hidden under a bed, it was this shock of his life.

Ma Guangdi was cleaning up after one of his former tenants in an apartment in Dongguan, Guangdong Province, China when he made the surprising discovery.

Underneath one of the beds, he found 6.33million Chinese Yuan in cash, stacked in carton boxes and left behind.

Cashflow: The money, a total of 6.33million Yuan (£616,000), was taken to a bank where it has been frozen pending investigation

The tenant had been out of reach for several months and after he stopped paying rent, Mr Ma went round to clear out the flat.

The former tenant had rented this apartment for several years, but after his contract ran out in may he has been out of reach and didn't continue paying the rent,’ Ma Guangdi said.

However it was not until recently that Mr Ma had time to go and clean out the apartment, where he and his friends discovered the huge stack of cash.

Hidden away: The cash was neatly stacked inside several cardboard boxes which Mr Ma found when he lifted the mattress

‘When we moved away the bed mattress, we saw that there were four carton boxes under the bed. Each box was fully stuffed and sealed up.’

When Mr Ma tore one corner of the box he was shocked to find that it was filled with bundles of cash.

Mr Ma called police who took the money away to be counted, with the local bank valuing the cash to 6.33million Yuan (£616,000)

The fortune has now been placed in a safety bank account and remains frozen while police investigate the former tenant.
