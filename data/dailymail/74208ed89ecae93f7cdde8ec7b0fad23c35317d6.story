Millions of people’s personal details may have been illegally sold to junk mail firms after a series of shocking leaks of the ‘private’ electoral register.

The leak of data, which was blamed on a ‘software error’, could lead to families being deluged with a flood of unwanted cold calls, emails and letters badgering them to sign up for deals and agreements.

Around 90 councils in England and Wales were affected by the problem - around one in four of the total.

Millions of people's personal details may have been illegally sold to junk mail firms after a series of shocking leaks of the 'private' electoral register

Those affected are members of the public who have explicitly told their councils not to pass on their personal data, including their name and address, when signing the electoral roll.

But their wishes were not passed on when the full register was transferred to credit reference agencies, who can sell it on to direct marketing firms.

The national data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner, has launched an investigation and last night issued a plea to councils affected to come forward.

Last night campaigners branded the scandal a ‘serious breach’ of individuals’ privacy.

Emma Carr, acting director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘If people want to vote, we have little choice but to hand over detailed information about ourselves.

‘So for millions of voters’ details to have been wrongly been passed onto third parties, when they had explicitly stated that they did not want this to occur, represents a serious breach of councils’ responsibility to protect their information.

‘Councils have so far done little to reassure voters that this serious breach of their trust is being taken seriously.’

Town halls sell on the register for as little as £5 a time to private companies, to customers including pizza delivery shops, estate agents and direct marketing firms - adding to the avalanche of junk mail.

Research published earlier this year showed more than 300 councils sold the register to 2,700 individuals and companies over the past five years. The councils involved made more than £250,000.

Campaigners have called for the edited register to be abolished to stop the tide of junk mail.

The latest scandal around the register emerged in recent days when three councils in Wales and Wokingham council in Berkshire admitted the ‘leak’ has affected a total of around 18,000 residents.

It is unclear how the long the problem has existed but Wokingham council said yesterday it had been using the software for ten years. The councils affected in Wales are Rhondda Cynon Taf, Torfaen and Caerphilly.

The Mail understands the company behind the software is Idox Plc, a software company based in Reading. Yesterday the company failed to respond to repeated requests for comment.

Councils collect two versions of the electoral register. The full version is used for voting records and criminal investigations but its distribution is very limited.

The edited register, which includes anyone who does not opt out, is available for sale to direct marketing firms.

Wokingham council said the software which manages its list of voters had failed to work properly.

It meant a large number of residents who had chosen to opt out of the edited register were not properly identified by the software when the list was passed on.

The edited register can be sold on to marketing firms but the full version of the register should only be used for elections, preventing and detecting crime and checking applications for credit.

Andrew Moulton, Wokingham council’s head of governance and improvement services, apologised to those affected.

He added: ‘As soon as we were made aware of the matter we took swift action to remove names and addresses from the public domain.

‘For a short time their names and addresses were incorrectly included on the edited register which means they may have received material from direct marketing companies during this time.

‘We have since provided the correct information to the various agencies that sell on this type of information and we believe personal details have now been removed.’ ‘I’d like to reassure our residents that every step necessary will be taken to ensure this doesn’t happen again.’

A spokesman for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: ‘The full version of the electoral register should only be used for elections, preventing and detecting crime and checking applications for credit. Any suggestion that it has been made available for other purposes raises clear data protection concerns.

‘We are aware that a number of councils have reported that a software error has resulted in the full electoral register being made available more widely than it should have been. We are currently making enquiries into these potential data breaches.’
