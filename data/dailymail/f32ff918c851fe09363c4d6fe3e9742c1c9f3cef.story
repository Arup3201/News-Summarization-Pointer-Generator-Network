A young mum put on a DVD at home and to her horror found herself watching movie footage of her own baby boy being tortured in his cot.

The traumatized woman in her 20’s, saw her 15-month-old child slapped, poked in the face and bombarded repeatedly with a ball, a Crown Court heard.

The shocking film of the baby sobbing in terror was made by the 24-year-old man who carried out the sadistic assaults.

Appalling cruelty: Mark Weatherall, 24, pictured, who filmed himself torturing a 15-month-old baby in its cot, was sentenced to a year in jail

Mark Weatherall, a builder’s labourer of Birtley Green, near Guildford, Surrey, was jailed for 12 months at Guildford Crown Court after pleading guilty to child cruelty.

The horrifying home movie was shown to a hushed courtroom before the defendant was sentenced.

A member of the public sitting in the court’s gallery fled the room in tears after witnessing the graphic scenes of the tiny victim’s suffering.

Sending Weatherall to prison, Judge Christopher Critchlow told him: 'Anybody watching that would be appalled by what you did'.

The Judge went on: 'It was a form of torture. It is difficult to understand why anyone could do such a thing to a defenceless 15 month old baby in his cot'.

The court was told that Weatherall was acquainted with the baby’s family and carried out the sick acts whilst he was alone with the child in December, last year.

It was revealed that Weatherall had been using cannabis at the time of the offences.

Wendy Cottee, prosecuting, said that the child’s mother had, out of curiosity, put on a DVD which she did not recognize

'What she saw horrified her,' said Ms Cottee.

The
film seen by the court depicted the child crying and screaming in fear 
as it was repeatedly slapped and poked in the face and had a ball thrown
at its head again and again.

Ms Cottee said that Weatherall would also pick up the baby by one of its legs and drop it.

'It’s a very disturbing case’ she said, adding: 'It appears to be gratuitous violence,'

The
court was told that Weatherall would record his actions either on a 
mobile or a web cam before downloading the material on to a disc - which
led to him being discovered.

Judge Critchlow told the defendant: 'People would also be appalled that you should film this these acts of violence.'

The Court heard that the tiny victim had escaped any noticeable signs of injury as a result of its ordeal.

But Ms Cottee said: 'The child has been affected by what has happened'. - now had a tendency to slap adults in the face.

David Smith, defending, said: 'My client has had a fairly appalling upbringing'.

He said Weatherall had also experienced violence from an adult when he was a child.

But Mr Smith stressed: 'I don’t want to minimise the gravity of the offence'.

He added that family members of the baby had shown the defendant nothing but kindness in the past.

Weatherall is now banned from working with children in the future.
