A sadistic mother who masterminded a sickening attack in which her own sister-in-law was held captive in a flat and tortured for five days has been jailed for four years.

Suzannah Bertram, 32, and two men tied Lisa Bertram up in a room in a flat in Blackpool, Lancashire, burned her with a gadget used to 'zap' insects, cut her with a knife, cut all her hair cut off, and forced her to swallow a 'noxious substance' along with a cocktail of medication.

The incident apparently took place after the group 'took exception' to something 36-year-old Lisa, who has learning difficulties, had said to Bertram.

Savage: Suzannah Bertram was jailed along with Derek Buchanan (left) and Fraser Gallagher (right) for torturing her sister-in-law Lisa, who has learning difficulties, over a five day period in August 2012

At one stage Lisa was taken to hospital when her lip ended up partially hanging off and became infected.

But after treatment she was allowed back to the flat in Central Drive, Blackpool, Lancashire, when Bertram ordered her to falsely tell medics she had been beaten up in the street.

Back at her makeshift cell, she was then subjected to yet more 'cruelty and degradation' before one of the gang made a 999 call when she passed out. 

Paramedics found Lisa in a 'very dire state' and was said to be 'very incoherent, injured, wrapped in a dirty duvet'. She woke up in hospital and is now recovering from her ordeal.

Details of the attack emerged at Burnley Crown Court where Bertram - the mother 'of a number of children' - admitted wounding, false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon.

Fraser Gallagher, 20, from Glasgow was locked up for 42 months and Derek Buchanan, 18, of Blackpool, was given 12 months.

The attack took place in a flat on Central Drive in Blackpool, Lancashire. Lisa Bertram had arrived with her husband Kevin only two months earlier and initially stayed with her attacker before moving to a flat upstairs

Both admitted false imprisonment, administering a noxious substance and possessing a prohibited weapon.

Earlier Richard Haworth, prosecuting, said the victim was a 'vulnerable young lady, with significant leaning difficulties.'

She arrived in Blackpool in June 2012 with her husband Kevin and initially stayed with Bertram before moving to rent the flat upstairs.

Mr Haworth added : 'Between August 13 and August 17, 2012, Lisa Bertram was subjected to a prolonged, cruel and degrading attack at the hands, at various times, of the three defendants.

'She sustained physical and emotional harm during the course of that time.'

The prosecutor said the attack began after the victim’s husband was admitted to Blackpool Victoria Hospital unbeknown to his wife. 

She went downstairs in search of him and found Bertram lying asleep on the sofa with two men inside the flat.

Mr Haworth said Gallagher then ordered Lisa to the floor by the window and then put the table over her, so it’s legs were by her head at one end and her knees at the other.

Heaters were then put either side of her and she was 'tightly encased' in that position. 

Gallagher then got a yard brush, put it on top of the table and she recalled feeling something wet on her legs. She thought it might be urine. 

The victim felt tingling in her legs and described what she thought was a 'zappy thing', which turned out to be a prohibited Taser-type device, which had originally been used as an electronic fly swatter. 

The prosecutor said: 'Clearly, at some stage during the course of that week-long period, she sustained an injury to her mouth, a serious tear to the upper lip. The lip was partially hanging off and became infected.'

Bertram took the victim to hospital where she received stitches but told her sister-in-law to say her injury had been caused by two girls. But Lisa did not go to the Royal Preston Hospital for further treatment as advised.

The prosecutor added: 'One cannot say how exactly, or who exactly, caused that injury to the lip. The fact remains it was caused during the time of the false imprisonment.'

The prosecutor said when the victim returned to the flat, she was made to go under the table again and one of her legs was tied up to the cord of one of the heaters.

He added: 'The following day, as she believed it was, Gallagher zapped her on the arm four times with the taser and cut her hair. Some of her husband’s medication was there and Suzannah Bertram told the complainant to take some.'

'Gallagher made her drink some yellow fluid. Derek Buchanan was present. He was part and parcel of the false imprisonment, administering the noxious substance and tasering. It beggars belief what these defendants were doing to her.'

Mr Haworth said at one point Bertram had taken a knife and started to cut downwards on Lisa's arm until the victim passed out.

Paramedics were eventually called to a report that Lisa had taken an overdose, only to be horrified when they arrived at the scene.

One of the paramedics said. 'She appeared as though she had not been cared for in any way.'

In mitigation defence counsel Sharon Watson said: 'It’s impossible to explain what would lead three people to behave in the terrible, despicable way that they did towards Lisa Bertram, a lady who had done absolutely nothing to them. '

'The best guess is that something was said by Lisa Bertram. Individually, none of the people in the dock would have behaved in the way that they did.

'It would appear together they conducted themselves in a way that was out of character and out of the norm. The incident was dreadful and must have been terrible for Lisa Bertram to endure.'

Sentencing, Judge Jonathan Gibson said: 'Over several days this incident occurred which led to harm to Lisa Bertram in a most cruel manner. This was a dreadful case.'
