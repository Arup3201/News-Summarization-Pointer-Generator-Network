Girls aged five to nine are developing type-2 diabetes, figures show.

There have been seven cases in England and Wales of five to nine-year-old girls with the condition, according to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health's National Paediatric and Diabetes Audit.

Doctors said they have treated cases of boys aged seven, though none were recorded in the audit.

There were a further 146 cases in girls aged ten to 14 and 64 cases in boys of the same age group, bringing risk of damage to eyes and kidneys, as well as heart attacks. 

The illness most commonly occurs in the over 40s and prior to the year 2000, no case had ever been recorded in the under 18s.

But academics have recorded a sudden increase over the past two decades which is almost certainly down to obesity, our sugary diets and lack of exercise.

They have also noted that the illness advances much more rapidly compared to adults and they quickly develop complications.

By the time they have reached their early teens, a number have suffered damage to their eyes and kidneys and are expected to have heart attacks in their 30s. 

The document also warns that there are huge variations in the care offered to children and young people with diabetes – most of whom have type 1.

Although the overall standards of treatment have improved, those living in the more deprived areas are less likely to have vital check ups

Just under 27,000 children, teenagers and young adults have diabetes of whom more than 97 per cent have type 1, which is believed to be genetic.

Dr Justin Warner, clinical lead for the audit, said: 'On the one hand the picture is positive; the quality of care for children and young people with diabetes is improving and we're getting better at ensuring care processes are met.

'Yet the challenge we face is also growing, with more children being diagnosed with diabetes and some displaying early signs of potentially serious long term health problems.

'This is a lifelong condition where tight overall diabetes control is important to reduce the risk of complications later in life. 

'This requires a close partnership between healthcare professionals delivering care and children and families with diabetes.'

Last year academics revealed that they were treating children as young as seven with type 2 diabetes.

Professor Tim Barrett, a consultant in paediatric diabetes at Birmingham Children's Hospital said a boy had been referred to him aged seven years 11 months, the youngest he'd seen.
