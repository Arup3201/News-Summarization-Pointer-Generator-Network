Judy Murray has revealed she is not finding it any easier watching her son Andy on the courts at Wimbledon - despite his success last year.

She roared him on to victory as he made it through to the quarter-finals yesterday, but admits that his matches are still nerve-racking to watch.

When asked if sitting in the players’ box was less stressful than last year, she said: 'No! I think there is a huge expectation level out there from everybody, obviously because he’s won Wimbledon and he’s won the US Open and the Olympics.

High hopes: Mrs Murray couldn't stay in her seat as she watched Andy in the Wimbledon finals last July. She said that her 27-year-old son is more mature this year, something that will help him in his push for the title

'I think everybody is expecting him to do well.'

Mrs Murray, who was , added that her son has the experience to win it all again.

'It’s a very, very tough sport. The strength in depth in the men’s game is enormous,' she said.

'But he’s been playing at Wimbledon since 2005, he knows what to expect.

'He’s always handled it really well and he’s 27 now, he’s older, more mature. He’ll be out there trying to do it all again.'

Murray’s next match is against Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov, who is dating Maria Sharapova. The British number one, who is seeded third at this year's tournament, is expected to win.

Mrs Murray was speaking at the launch of the Miss-Hits tennis programme, which she created along with the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA) to encourage young girls to pursue the sport.

She also hit out at parents who don't spend enough time playing sports with their children.

She said: ‘I loved all sports when I was young, I wanted my kids to enjoy sport so I was always playing actively with them, whatever they wanted to play. 

‘But it’s not every parent that does that with their kids anymore.

‘It’s much easier to hand them a DVD or a CD or something and sit and watch that.

‘I think parents generally have less time, maybe more money and less time, so they are paying people to look after their kids and do the activity with them, rather than doing it themselves.’

She said: ‘The things that are trendy for kids to play with nowadays tend to be sedentary things. You sit and twiddle your thumbs or you watch something on a wide screen and that is just a fact of life.
