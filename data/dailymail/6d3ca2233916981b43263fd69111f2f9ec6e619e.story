The 2014 Ryder Cup celebrations got into full swing on Sunday night after Europe emerged 16½-11½ winners against USA.

Rory McIlroy, donning a red tartan kilt and a wig, was snapped topless looking a little worse for wear as the Northern Irishman took to Instagram to show how he bid Gleneagles farewell.

McIlroy, asked on Monday morning about USA's Phil Mickelson after the American openly criticised captain Tom Watson, said it was 'unfortunate' that neither stayed to see off the Ryder Cup in style.

'We had a great time with the American team last night, they seemed in good spirits,' McIlroy told Sky Sports. 'Tom wasn't there, he didn't really hang around too much. 

'It was unfortunate. We don't know what the dynamic was in the team room. All we know if we had a great captain and we did the things we needed to do to be able to win the Ryder Cup.

'I'm sure the Americans will go back now and think about what didn't go right.' 

McIlroy put his earlier mishap behind him when the 25-year-old accidentally popped a champagne bottle too early on the green by getting 'into the Scottish swing of things' on Sunday night.

Likewise, USA's Rickie Fowler and Bubba Watson went about dealing with the loss in their own way by wearing the same Scottish-themed costumes as both teams had a blowout.

A noticeable absentee from USA's send off was  Mickelson, who didn't hang around to celebrate the Ryder Cup coming to an end after his damning analysis of captain Watson.

Watson, in response to Mickelson's criticism, said: 'The issue between Phil and myself is basically a difference of opinion. He has a difference of opinion where he would like to manage the team and I certainly had my own opinion on how I'd manage the team.

'That's the controversy and that's the issue but I have to say that I'm very proud of my team's efforts. One thing I asked them to do from the beginning was to give absolutely everything they have and they did. They just ran up against a buzz saw.

'The European team was very strong and had four of the top five players in the world. When you play against them, you better be firing on all cylinders and frankly, we weren't so that's it.'

European captain Paul McGinley, holding a copy of the Daily Mail, couldn't be further from criticism after being hailed  as 'phenomenal' by McIlroy and Co for commanding the win over USA.

Sunday night was about seeing off the Ryder Cup in good spirits and, when USA won at table tennis against Europe, McIlroy quipped: 'That's one thing they beat us at this week.'

Europe's Lee Westwood certainly got his priorities right, putting his 3&2 loss against Jimmy Walker in Sunday's singles behind to celebrate the overall win as soon as possible.

The 41-year-old momentarily looked in a world of his own  during a press conference on Sunday evening, only for the cork to fly off a champagne bottle before pouring himself a well-earned drink. 

It's the least those on Team Europe deserve, and it was topped off by a hearty breakfast and a friendly lift home from the police, too.

Europe's Jamie Donaldson was certainly not coy about how he celebrated the Ryder Cup win. 

When asked if the enormity of clinching the winning point had sunk in, the Welshman replied: 'No, because I'm still drunk.'

Donaldson took dead aim and played the stroke that will follow him for the rest of his days as it never left the flag and came to rest six inches from the 15th hole.

From the sidelines, jubilant winning captain McGinley emerged and jumped on his back.

Ian Poulter was very much a part of the Sunday night celebrations, too, admitting he felt 'a little worse for wear' on Monday morning as he made his way to the airport after staying up until 4am.

Still, Fowler and Watson's way of dealing with the defeat may be more harmless than what USA teammate Mickelson did in the aftermath.

Mickelson, asked about USA captain Watson, said: 'There were two things that allowed us to play our best that Paul Azinger (the 2008 captain) did.

'First, he got everybody invested in the process. He got everybody invested in who they were going to play with, who the picks were going to be, who was going to be in their "pod", when they would play, and they had a great leader for each pod. We hung out together.

'The other things that Paul did really well was he had a game plan for us - how we were going to go about doing this, how we were going to go about playing together, if so-and-so is playing well, if so-and-so is not playing well.

'Those two things helped us bring out our best golf. We use that same process in the Presidents Cup and we do really well.

'Unfortunately we have strayed from a winning formula for the last three Ryder Cups and we need to consider maybe getting back to that formula that helped us play our best.'

Asked if he believed his comments were disloyal to Watson, he replied: 'I'm sorry you're taking it that way. I'm just talking about what Paul Azinger did to help us play our best.'
