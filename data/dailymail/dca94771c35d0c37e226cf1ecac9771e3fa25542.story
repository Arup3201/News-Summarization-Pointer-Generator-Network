Luckily it was a warm day when a crowd of brave exhibitionists descended on Cornbury Park in Oxfordshire and stripped off.

They took to the water naked in a bid to  break the record for the world's largest skinny dip.

The swimmers - who had not met each other before - all met up at 8pm on Saturday and were taken to one of the lakes surrounding the Wilderness Festival.

Entering the water slowly: The new swimming club, from the creators of Secret Cinema, will bring together people every month and invite them to swim in the wildest, most beautiful places

It was also to celebrate the launch of a new secret swimming club which will bring 
together people every month and invite them to swim in the wildest, most
 beautiful places.

The locations will be kept secret till the last 
moment and only released to the Secret Swimming community.

The idea is the brainchild of Secret Cinema creators - a group responsible for theatrical hidden screenings.

The new club has been created by the same team which are behind Secret Cinema - a secret film experience

'When you go skinny dipping late at 
night on a beach somewhere with a group of friends, it's an amazing 
experience,' Future Cinema and Secret Swimming founder Fabien Riggall 
told Wired.co.uk.

'It's fun. I think our audience is looking for ways of doing things that are a bit different.'

It's unconfirmed if they broke the record but as they appealed for people to join in, they said on their events website that they predicted: 'Two thousand mostly naked lovely people celebrate wild waters' at similar events around the world.
