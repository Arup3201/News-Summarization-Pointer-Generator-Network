A self-proclaimed ‘cyber goth’ claimed today that she was forced to leave a pub with her parents because of her eccentric appearance.

Laura Kelly, 22, who has a face full of piercings, paints on her eyebrows and brightly-coloured hair, tried to visit her local Wetherspoon in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, with her mother and father.

But the student alleged she was asked to leave because her face did not fit in - something the company denies, insisting she was turned away for causing a ‘complete mess’ on a previous visit.

University of Manchester student: She alleged she was asked to leave the pub because her face did not fit in

The University of Manchester student, who insists it was because of her ‘extreme’ look, claimed drinkers at The Ash Tree unfairly mocked her as a ‘transgender’ and ‘freak show’ as she left.

Miss Kelly, who is in her third year of studying history of art, said: ‘Two members of staff, a middle-aged blonde woman and a ginger guy with an earring said that they would not serve me.’

Speaking to student newspaper The Tab, she added: ‘The blonde came over and she was irate. She said “don’t bother coming in the bar because we won’t serve you”.

‘One of the customers then said “get out of here - you’re a freak show” and started yelling abusive comments. He also called me "transgender", which made me laugh.

‘They all joined in and pretty much evicted me. It was horrific and they were really out of order.’

A Wetherspoon spokesman insisted Miss Kelly was turned away because during her last visit made a mess out of the pub - something she denies.

He said: ‘The lady in question was not served because she had previously been into the pub with a group who had made a complete mess.

‘Wetherspoon appeals to a broad spectrum of customers and their appearance is not a factor in whether they are served or not.’

But Miss Kelly hit back, saying: ‘It’s ridiculous. The last time I was there was probably six months ago and I just had a quiet glass of wine at the bar with a friend.’

Cyber goths form a modern subculture of goths that combine traditional elements such as dramatic make-up and body piercings, with raver fashions including bright colours and synthetic hair.

The term was coined in Britain in 1988 - and it began to evolve as a style about a decade later.
