Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport on Monday

A serial airline stowaway who has been arrested at California airports six times has finally managed to fly without a ticket.

Marilyn Jean Hartman, 62, who is a well-known plane-hopper, sneaked past a Transportation Security Administration checkpoint at Mineta San Jose International Airport on Monday night and boarded a Southwest Airlines flight to Los Angeles.  

She was only caught after the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport and the crew counted the passengers who remained on board for the final destination to Phoenix. 

Hartman was hauled off the plane and charged with trespassing by the Los Angeles Police Department. 

Hartman's antics - which previously targeted San Francisco International Airport - have made her something of a folk hero in the Bay Area. 

On her first attempt, on February 15, she sneaked through TSA security and boarded a plane bound for Hawaii. She managed to take a seat on the flight - but was caught when the passenger who paid for a ticket in the seat showed up. 

She told police at the time that she had cancer - a claim that has not been substantiated - and that she wanted to go someplace warm.

A Go Fund Me page set up by sympathetic San Franciscans has raised nearly $1,300 toward sending her legally on a Hawaiian vacation.

The San Jose Mercury News reports that Hartman sneaked past the TSA agents check boarding passes while a family was being screened on Monday night. She had tried three times to get past the checkpoint unsuccessfully before she made it through.

She then got into the security line and was screened for weapons like all other passengers.

Once in the terminal, she tried unsuccessfully to board several planes before she was able to get aboard the Southwest Flight to Los Angeles.

Southwest, unlike many other major airlines, does not have assigned seats - which could explain how she wasn't discovered until the plane landed at LAX. 

This is the second high-profile security breach at Mineta San Jose International Airport this year. In April, a 15-year-old boy scaled a fence and sneaked into the wheel-well of a Maui-bound plane. Incredibly, he survived the freezing temperatures for five-and-a-half hours and landed safely in Hawaii.  

Authorities in San Francisco say Hartman suffers from 'major mental illness.' After she was arrested a third time, prosecutors said they would work to get her into a treatment facility instead of pursuing criminal charges. 

Despite the multiple arrests and warnings to stay away from airports if she didn't have a valid ticket, Hartman has repeatedly been arrested there - once for just being in a food court. 

She has told police that she feels safer at airports than she does in her San Francisco apartment,
