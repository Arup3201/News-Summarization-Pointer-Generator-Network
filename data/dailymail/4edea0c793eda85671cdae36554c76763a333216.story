Phillip Hughes’ family, team mates and mentors gathered at the Sydney Cricket Ground in the hours after his shattering death to comfort each other and remember their mate.

It was just over 48 hours after the 25-year-old sustained his catastrophic injury at the crease, when he suffered a vertebral artery dissection whilst batting for South Australia in the Sheffield Shield clash against New South Wales.

But that pitch was also the site of many triumphs and thrilling moments for the young player, a batsman with a bright future that will tragically go unplayed.

Such moments included his debut for NSW in 2007 at the age of 18. 

At the end of that season, he returned to the SCG and became the youngest player to score a century in a Sheffield Shield final to help NSW claim victory over Victoria. 

It was a fitting place to come together, as his family explained that Phillip Hughes 'lived for cricket' in a statement read by Australian captain Michael Clarke at a media conference on Thursday evening.

Visitors who were giving their last respects to Hughes before his life support machine was turned off left the hospital en route to the SCG during the media press conference.

Hughes' parents, Greg and Virginia, along with sister Megan were seen leaving hand-in-hand after they were joined by members of the close-knit cricketing community, including teammates of the fallen batsman.

Sporting legends Ricky Ponting and Brett Lee were joined by David Warner, James Pattinson, Peter Siddle, Matthew Wade and Aaron Finch who all looked sombre as they walked into the cricket headquarters. 

Dual international, cricket and football player Ellyse Perry was also in attendance.  

Brett Lee and fast bowler Mitchell Johnson embraced warmly as they greeted each other. 

Two hours later, Lee was seen leaving Cricket NSW alone looking downcast, looking up only to nod thanks to well wishers.  

Clearly distressed, David Warner and Matthew Wade were both supported by their partners.

A man that has shown incredible strength and composure throughout the two days that followed Hughes' accident, Australian team doctor Dr Peter Brukner, told Daily Mail Australia that he is 'okay' but explained with a tired smile that it had been 'a long day'.  

On the grounds where the fatal blow was delivered, friends took turns standing at the crease to commemorate Hughes.

Close friend Michael Clarke stood in solitude at the wickets for 45 minutes until the sun set over the pitch, Sky News reported.

Glenn McGrath, Brad Haddin and Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland left at around 10pm, epitomising how the young player had touched the lives of players, mentors and cricket officials, as well as won the hearts of cricket fans worldwide.

When news of Hughes' death broke, flags at SCG and Adelaide Oval were lowered to half-mast in honour of the 25-year-old.

The rising star was set to take the place of injured Australian cricketing captain Michael Clarke's place for the upcoming test against India set to commence on December 4.

Hughes was left in an induced coma after he was struck by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott on Tuesday during day one of the Sheffield Shield.

Two days later, with his condition unchanged following emergency brain surgery to relieve swelling on his brain, the batsman died at St Vincent's Hospital in Darlinghurst - in Sydney's inner-city.

This comes as tributes across the country and the world are taking place for the fallen cricketer.

At Adelaide Oval, a portrait of a smiling Hughes was emblazoned on the big screen outside, while 'Vale Phillip Hughes' was written out on the scoreboard inside.

In the United Arab Emirates at Sharjah cricket stadium, a picture of Hughes was put up in his honour.

A bunch of white roses was seen left at Lord's Cricket Ground at Westminster in England and in Kolkata in India in members of two local clubs observed a moment of silence in remembrance of Hughes.
