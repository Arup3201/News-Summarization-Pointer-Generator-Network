Health officials say children should be banned from jumping on trampolines because they are too dangerous.

Citing nearly 100,000 injuries in 2009 alone, the American Academy of Pediatrics has also dismissed the recent addition of safety nets around trampolines.

The Academy claims the nets do not make much difference in terms of safety, but instead lull parents into a false sense of security.

Lethal: Officials from the American Academy of Pediatrics have said children should be banned from jumping on trampolines because they are too dangerous

'Pediatricians need to actively 
discourage recreational trampoline use,' Dr Michele LaBotz, lead author of the
new AAP statement and a sports medicine physician at Intermed Sports 
Medicine in Portland, Oregon, told NBC News.

'This is not a toy. It’s a piece of equipment. We recommend 
that you not provide it for your family or your neighbours to use. But if
you do use one, you need to be aware of the risks.'

Dr LaBotz added: 'I think parents see the soft springy
mat and they think it’s safe, like water.

'What they 
don’t realise is that once you get it to bouncing, especially if there 
are multiple users, it can be dangerous.

Should children be banned from jumping on trampolines for safety reasons?

'Bigger kids and adults like to 
rocket propel up the little kids, getting them to bounce higher than 
they would otherwise and if the kid comes down wrong, it is the same as 
falling nine or 10 feet onto a hard surface.'

Data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS) revealed the 75 per cent of trampoline injuries happen when there is more than one person jumping on one.

And it's the younger, smaller children at greater risk of significant injuries, including fractures of the legs and worse, the spine.

NEISS reported that 37 to 39 per cent of all its recorded injuries were caused by falls from a trampoline.

Worrying: Dr LaBotz, lead author of a new AAP statement on trampolines, also highlighted one study that found one in 200 trampoline injuries cause some kind of permanent neurological damage

Dr LaBotz also highlighted one study that found one in 200 trampoline injuries cause some kind of permanent neurological damage.

In her experience parents often continue to let their children use a trampoline ever after they have been injured because of it.

'There are a number of families, even those with kids who 
have had significant injuries, who decide they still want the trampoline
as part of what they offer to their children,' Dr LaBotz said.

Dr Barbara A 
Gaines, director of trauma and injury prevention at the Children’s 
Hospital of Pittsburgh of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, told the news station that parents often think an injury caused by a trampoline is 'one of those freak things'.

'But these are not just accident,' she adds. 'There is a pattern 
to them and there’s something we can do to prevent them. It’s not that 
we don’t want kids to have fun. But injury shouldn’t be an expected part
of childhood.'
