A motorist left devastated when thieves took his beloved sports car has been reunited with it - 33 years later.

George Talley, 71, last saw his prized Chevrolet Corvette in 1981 when it was stolen after he parked it on a street.

He never expected to drive it again but last year got a phone call out of the blue to say it had been found in Mississippi - more than 600 miles away from his Detroit home.

Despite being missing for more than three decades, the treasured motor had travelled just 47,000 miles extra and was in perfect running order.

It had been sitting in a police station in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, the American Automobile Association told him.

General Motors, which owns Chevrolet, offered to pick it up and returned it to a delighted Mr Talley this week.

He said: 'It was a lucky day to hear that my car had been found. They told me it was running, had 47,000 miles on it and was ready for me to pick up.'

Perfect working order: The vehicle was in good condition having only been driven an extra 47,000 miles since being taken in 1981

GM Product Development Executive Vice President Mark Reuss heard the story and offered to ship the car back to Detroit where it was delivered to Mr Talley at the automaker's world headquarters - about three miles from where it was stolen.

'George's story brought a smile to my face,' Mr Reuss said.

'As a longtime Corvette owner myself, I know the passion the car inspires.

'I also knew that car belonged home in Detroit, with its rightful owner, and we could make that happen.'
