This is the Kurdish fighter who has been battling jihadists since he was teenager and is desperate to get back into Syria to stop Islamic State militants from taking the border town of Kobane.

Delkhwaz Sheikh Ahmad, a father-of-two, is currently living in the Turkish town of Suruc after fleeing there with his wife and sons. 

But the 22-year-old is hoping to sneak back across the border into Kobane to help with the fight to stop the town falling to ISIS jihadists.

Delkhwaz Sheikh Ahmad, bottom left, poses with other Kurdish fighters on the outskirts of Kobane. Mr Ahmad has been fighting jihadists since he was a teenager and is desperate to get back into Syria to defend the under-siege town 

Mr Ahmad said there are many Kurdish fighter, such as those pictured who want to defend their land 

The father-of-two pictured recently with a female comrade, first started fighting when he was a conscript in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army 

He said: 'It is hard, but we will get back in because our friends are there. We have to get inside, even if there is hardship, we will get inside.' 

Mr Ahmad was a conscript serving his military service in Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's army when the Syrian revolution broke out three years ago. 

During the conflict, the Syrian Kurd, who was only a teenager at the time, was seriously wounded in Daraa, while fighting rebels. 

The bullet that hit him narrowly missed his heart, and he was sent to his home village of Metina to recover. 

Mr Ahmad and his brother approach the Syrian/Turkish border on motorcycles on the outskirts of Suruc to try to sneak back into Syria 

So far the men have been unable to make the crossing and they have been stuck in Turkey, despite wanting to fight 

But his injury didn't stop his desire to fight and soon after returning home he joined a local self-defence force, who were protecting the village. 

The force then ended up fighting against four separate rebel groups, which included the Western-backed Free Syrian Army, the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, the Raqqa Brigade and ISIS.

His militia eventually joined the main Kurdish militia, the People's Protection Units, also known as YPG which joined forces with the Raqqa Brigade. 

The YPG are now embroiled in a fierce fight for the town of Kobane and he has already lost two cousins and many of his friends in the conflict. 

The 22-year-old evacuated his family, including his wife Siham and two sons, to Turkey after ISIS began to advance in September 

His sons Dilyar, left, and Ibrahim, right, are currently in Suruc with their mother and Mr Ahmad visits them every few weeks 

As ISIS then started to advance closer to Kobane, and fearing for his family's safety he evacuated his wife Siham and their two sons three-year-old Ibrahim and Dilyar, two, to Turkey last month. 

They now live with his brother in Suruc across the Turkish border but Mr Ahmad stayed behind to help defend Kobane. 

Every few weeks, he takes a couple of days to cross the border into Turkey to visit his family. 

But with the crossing closed, he is now stuck in Turkey and desperate to get back to Kobane with several other fighters. 

He explained: 'We just want to defend our lands, our towns, our villages, where Kurdish people are.' 

The family members gather around and share breakfast before the men head towards the border to try to enter Kobane 

While stuck in Turkey, the 22-year-old checks his phone to keep up to date on what is happening in Kobane before he returns 

However, Turkey is not expected to send troops or aid to the Kurdish fighters who are defending Kobane due to a decades-long dispute it has waged against a Kurdish guerrilla group linked to the city's defenders. 

The fighters in Kobane are affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which both Turkey and the U.S. consider a terrorist organisation.

Turkey has openly said it is blocking Turkish Kurds from joining the fight in the town. 

Neither Turkey nor the Syrian Kurds are said to be enthusiastic about joining ranks if Turkey sends army troops to Kobane.

Further complicating the issue, the U.S. said it has begun talking directly to the Kurdish fighters' political wing in Kobani - a diplomatic move that could stretch tensions with Turkey even farther.

A Turkish government official on Friday said Ankara does not oppose action that is intended to weaken ISIS.

'Turkey is part of the coalition against ISIL,' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authoriSed to make public statements.

The Syrian Kurdish fighter said: 'It is hard, but we will get back in because our friends are there. We have to get inside, even if there is hardship, we will get inside

Meanwhile the U.S. military has continued to launch airstrikes around Kobane in a bid to stop ISIS taking the strategic border town. 

Yesterday they confirmed that six airstrikes hit Syria overnight with targets including ISIS petroleum storage tanks and a pumping station. 

The sites hit are central to the militants ability to resupply their forces and generate revenue. 

But despite the airstrikes and the resistance by the Kurdish forces, the Pentagon has warned it may take time to overcome ISIS. 

Rear Admiral John Kirby said: 'This isn't going to get solved through 18 airstrikes around a particular town in a particular place in Syria. 

'It's going to take a long time.'
