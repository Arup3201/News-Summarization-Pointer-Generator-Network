Cervical Cancer story. Charlotte Brown,37, who survived cancer, is suing the NHS after she was given the all-clear to a smear test - and got cervical cancer two years later

A mother-of-two who was diagnosed with cervical is suing the NHS because she was hit with the disease two years after getting the all clear from a smear test.

Charlotte Brown, 37, from Pucklechurch, south Gloucestershire was one of the thousands of women who went to the doctors for a smear test as part of the 'Jade Goody effect' caused by when the Big Brother star died from cervical cancer in 2009.

She was given the all clear two years ago, when her results came back as 'normal' and she continued her day-to-day life.

But two years later Brown went to the doctor with worrying symptoms, and was later diagnosed as cervical cancer.

Brown then had to undergo several weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, followed by surgery, before being told she was in remission.

Now, she is taking legal action against North Bristol NHS Trust after saying her test was wrongly reported as clear when there were abnormalities.

She also wants new rules to be introduced which will mean stricter double-checking of test results.

Brown said: “I passed out when the doctors told me, I was very scared.

'I had two children aged five and four at the time and I had separated from my husband so I was worried about who would look after my children.

'The whole ordeal has had a huge physical and emotional impact on me.

'I go for regular smear tests and it’s distressing to know that abnormalities were there but they were not reported.

'I know that mistakes will always happen but making the screening system safer by ensuring tests are thoroughly double checked could help to capture more cases where errors have been made.

'This in turn could help to ensure more women at risk of cervical cancer get the treatment they urgently need.'

One of Brown's first tests was five years ago after Jade Goody's case hit the news.

Like Goody, Brown claims that despite having the correct examination clear signs were missed.

She says her treatment of radiotherapy, chemotherapy and surgery has caused her to have long-term health problems, including not being able to have any more children, and lymphoedema, a condition that causes her legs to swell.

As a result, she has mobility problems, and has been forced to give up her job as an elderly support worker.

Angharad Hughes, Charlotte’s medical negligence solicitor at firm JMW said: 'The screen process does involve some smear tests being doubled-checked.

'However the second ‘rapid review’ check is done very quickly, meaning there is greater room for error.

'As a safety net to pick up cases that were missed on the first check it is not ideal.'

A spokeswoman for North Bristol NHS Trust said: 'We are aware of Ms Brown’s case but due to ongoing legal proceedings it would be inappropriate for us to comment on the matter at this time.'

Cervical screening is about 80 per cent to 90 per cent reliable and can prevent 60 to 80% of cervical cancers, and there are several factors at play in the taking and reading of cervical screenings which makes it impossible for it to be 100 per cent accurate. 

In addition, a cervical screening will not give a final diagnosis, as it is just a screening test used to detect early abnormalities, not cancer as a whole.

Public Health England recommends women attend as many screenings as they are invited to and take the advice they are given at these screenings.
