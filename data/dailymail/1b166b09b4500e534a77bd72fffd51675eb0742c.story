Convicted: Twice-married constable Matthew Daniel Fisher who used his job to seduce women

A sex-obsessed police officer who used his job to chase, seduce and sexually assault women was behind bars last night.

Twice-married constable Matthew Daniel Fisher, 37, had sex in a police van with a woman he met at a supermarket.

They had an affair after he used the force computer to look up her details.

He had a sex romp with another 26-year-old woman while on duty after initially chatting her up and offering her a lift home in his police van as she enjoyed a night out on New Year’s Day.

Fisher seduced her by lying about not being married.

The police officer patrolled the streets looking for a target to pursue and wouldn’t take no for an answer.

And he forced himself upon vulnerable women who he came across during his duties because they were victims of crime.

Fisher was found guilty of three sex assault offences on two women and convicted of misconduct in public office for using a police database to get mobile phone numbers of women he fancied.

One received 52 calls and didn’t return any.

Following the verdicts at Hull Crown Court he was remanded in custody and was told by the judge he would be jailed at a hearing next month.

Fisher, who has two children aged 13 and eight, had previously admitted two further misconduct in public office offences for having sex romps whilst on duty with two women.

However, he was cleared of attempting to rape a 20-year-old who had called police because she had been assaulted by her partner.

Fisher arrived at the house to take her statement and the woman said ‘he kept asking me if I had knickers on.’

The PC allegedly grabbed her and said ‘all you young girls like it’ and pinned her to the bed and attempted to rape her.

But Fisher denied assaulting the woman, who told him she wanted to be a glamour model, and insisted she performed a sex act on him.

The judge said he would have faced a jail term of ‘five to six years’ if he had been convicted of the attempted rape.

Some women did fall for his unsubtle approach.

In one case he wrote his telephone number on the back of a girl’s car in the snow - described as the cheesiest approach she had ever seen.

While Stephanie Yates, 24, first met Fisher when shopping in Morrison’s supermarket in Selby.

He saw her at 3am the next day as she walked home with a friend and he later sent her a text.

Asked how he got her number, Fisher texted: ‘I took the liberty of looking you up.’

His first victim was a 22-year-old drug addict and alcoholic.

Fisher went to a flat to ask her and several friends to turn make less noise.

Fisher agreed to give the drunk woman a lift home and flirted with her in the car.

He then grabbed her hand and put it on his trousers, with the comment: ‘What do you think of the size of that? It’s big innit?’ She pulled away and got out.

Fisher also visited the house of a mother who needed police help after her son was involved in an incident.

He visited her home repeatedly and often made sexual comments to her.

She claimed he pulled at her top and looked at her breasts. Fisher also allegedly exposed himself to her and assaulted her in the kitchen as she put on make-up.

Police began inquiries in March 2011 when the partner of one victim went to police.

After the case temporary North Yorkshire Police Chief Constable Tim Madgwick praised the victims for having the courage to come forward and said Fisher - who was known by his middle name - would be sacked.

He said: ‘Daniel Fisher has brought disgrace on the office of Constable. He abused his position of authority for the sake of his own gratification.

This behaviour is completely unacceptable.’
