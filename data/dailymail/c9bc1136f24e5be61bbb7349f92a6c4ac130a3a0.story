An Oklahoma resident has captured the harrowing moment the body of a little girl was found buried in the rubble following Monday's terrifying tornado.

Just minutes after the twister struck, David Canavesio, a videographer by trade, got out his camera phone to record the devastation.

But he was horrified to record the moment parents discovered the body of their lifeless daughter had been found in the debris.

In the 3.39 clip posted on the internet, Mr  Canavesio is seen wandering in a daze through the devastated landscape which is a sea of flattened homes.

The Moore resident provides a running commentary saying he is just seeing 'survivors walking around in a daze.'

'This is just horrific, everyone of these tiles could potentially have someone underneath.'

Suddenly he says 'I think we may have found someone over here.'

'I don't want to record this but they 
just found a little girl over there. She's dead and uh I think out of 
respect I shouldn't be taping this.'

It then cuts again and re-opens on Mr   Canavesio stating 'I could see her arm and her face protruding from the rubble.

'Her parents are over here looking and the police have gone over to tell them. Very sad.' The identity of the girl has not been revealed.

He then points to a couple who are off screen. After posting the video online Mr 
Canavesio said  'At the moment my iphone was in my hand and I just 
started recording without really thinking. I tried to help but it was﻿ 
so overwhelming. Not sure I did much good.

Today residents began returning home to their flattened Oklahoma town after a giant tornado killed at least 24 people, destroyed countless homes and reduced one elementary school almost entirely to rubble, killing seven children inside.

Authorities said they were confident that all survivors and bodies had been found.

As state and federal officials work to set up disaster recovery centers to provide aid and assistance, residents of Moore were beginning the deliberate process of assessing what's left of their homes and possessions and what comes next.

Helmeted rescue workers have been searching tirelessly for survivors and victims, and officials said Tuesday they planned to keep going - sometimes double- and triple-checking home sites. Officials were not certain of how many homes were destroyed or how many families had been displaced.

Emergency crews had trouble navigating devastated neighborhoods because there were no street signs left. Some rescuers used smartphones or GPS devices to guide them through areas with no recognizable landmarks.

Moore Fire Chief Gary Bird said Tuesday he was confident there are no more bodies or survivors in the rubble. Every damaged home had been searched at least once, Bird said, but his goal was to conduct three searches of each building just to be certain there were no more bodies or survivors.

'I'm 98 percent sure we're good,' Bird said.

Monday's tornado, which traveled 17 miles (27 kilometers) and was 1.3 miles (2 kilometers) wide at points, loosely followed the path of a twister that brought 300 mph (482 kph) winds in May 1999.

This week's tornado was the fourth since 1998 to hit Moore, a middle-class community that has been one of the fastest-growing suburbs of Oklahoma City.
