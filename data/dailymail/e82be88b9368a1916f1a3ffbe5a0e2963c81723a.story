An executive at an exclusive private hospital is seeking more than £1million in damages after suffering a breakdown she claims was caused by her ‘megalomaniac’ boss.

Sandra King claims she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder after she was bullied by the man who took over the management of the Cromwell Hospital in central London, which is now run by Bupa.

Mrs King, 53, alleges the acting chief executive at the hospital said she was ‘special’ and told her about his sex life in late night phone calls.

The mother-of-two told the High Court that the ‘charming’ doctor had initially taken her into his confidence and told her she was ‘the only one he could trust’.

But his behaviour changed  after the Abu Dhabi royal family, who run the private hospital, had  promoted Dr Abdul Al Muhairi  to acting chief executive officer in 2005.

As he gained more power, her  colleague became a ‘dictator and megalomaniac’ who phoned her late at night and shouted at her, she claimed.

Mrs King, who had worked at the hospital for 23 years, said: ‘When he took over the job he completely changed from this pleasant man into this awful, awful person.’

Her counsel, Simon Livingstone, told Deputy Judge John Leighton Williams QC that Mrs King had initially tried to ‘laugh off’ his actions.

But when Dr Al Muhairi assumed the role of acting CEO, a picture emerged of ‘over-familiarity, innuendo, on occasions inappropriate physical contact, personal and professional humiliation… veiled threats and blackmail.’

At one stage Dr Al Muhairi sent Mrs King a ‘special Christmas gift’.

When she opened it, she was shocked to find it contained nothing but male toiletries, and told her husband when she saw it: ‘So this is his special gift’.

She later tried to convince herself that the ‘odd’ gift was an accident, with the present perhaps intended for a male colleague, but she finally concluded that it was a ‘deliberate and offensive act’.

The former executive manager at the hospital said her treatment became intolerable and she was forced to quit her role.

She has been unable to work since 2006 due to the stress she suffered and has undergone counselling at the Priory Clinic.

Prior to that, Mr Livingstone said Mrs King had been a ‘consummate professional’, an ambitious and able woman, who excelled at her job and was respected by her colleagues.

Medical Services International Ltd, who run the Cromwell, deny responsibility for her breakdown, instead blaming it on marriage difficulties, having to bring up an autistic son and medical problems from going through the menopause.

Yesterday, John Williams, representing the hospital, claimed Mrs King had struck up a friendship with Dr Al Muhairi at a time when she ‘craved friendly male attention’ after her husband had been made redundant.

He claimed she was nursing a grievance because Dr Al Muhairi had earlier been appointed company secretary instead of her.

Mrs King said a colleague had told her Dr Al Muhairi had opposed her appointment, but the prosecution suggested other members of the board had been behind the move.

Mr Williams said: ‘You have constructed in your own mind that in some way Dr Al Muhairi is to blame that he became company secretary and you did not.’

He added: ‘You spent a long time at the hospital. You were a career woman. You had your children and you returned to work and work formed a big part of your life and you wanted that job.

‘Your personal life was empty at this time. You were very committed to your work and Dr Al Muhairi when you started to work with him.

‘You had a professional relationship and he was seen by you as offering you friendship.

‘You had invested yourself both professionally in terms of your career and personally in terms of your friendship.’

Dr Al Muhairi left the hospital in 2008. The case continues.
