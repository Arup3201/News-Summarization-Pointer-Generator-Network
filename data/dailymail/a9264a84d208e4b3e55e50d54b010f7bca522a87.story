Three adults and a minor face a litany of charges related to the drug overdose deaths of two young people in suburban Minneapolis.

Tyler A. Caputo, 21, James L. Inman, 30, Skylar Jo Reichel-Schneider, 19, and a 15-year-old male are accused of providing the drugs that are believed to have killed Louis N. Folson-Hart, 22, and Chloe L. Moses, 17 last week.

The 15-year-old sold a synthetic version of either cocaine or LSD in a small baggie with blue crowns on it that were used by Moses shortly before her death, police told WCCO.

Inman admitted he sold the substance dubbed ‘2-C’ to Folson-Hart after obtaining it from Caputo, authorities said.

Moses, a junior at Mankato West High School, was flown Saturday to a Minneapolis hospital after being found unconscious in her home, said cops. She was taken off life support on Monday.

The circumstances surrounding Folson-Hart’s death aren’t as clear, but authorities have disclosed the he took the substance shortly before dying.

The 15-year-old immediately gave up both Caputo and Reichel-Schneider when confronted by police, a search of the couple’s home found several clear capsules filled with white powder and the blue baggies, according to a criminal complaint cited by The Republic.

Also found were marijuana pipes, a pill crusher, snort tubes with residue, a digital scale, a mushroom grower Caputo swore was not his, bags of brown powder, bags of light tan or pink powder and bags with other powder hidden in a safe, said police.

A search of the kitchen found a mason jar filled with marijuana and stored next to baby food, cops said.

Even worse, the drugs were all within a baby’s reach in what authorities called their ‘cluttered and filthy’ home.

‘Several of the suspected drug paraphernalia and other related items, including the capsules of an unknown substance and the psilocybin mushroom grower, were accessible to a juvenile toddler, who also resides in the residence,’ said the criminal complaint.

Caputo and his girlfriend were each charged with threefelony counts odf selling drugs – including to someone under 18 – and gross-misdemeanor child endangerment, according to the Star-Tribune.

Inman and the 15-year-old were each charged with one felony count of selling drugs.

The three adults are being held in county jail, the minor in a juvenile detention center.
