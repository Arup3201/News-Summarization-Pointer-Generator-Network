Sarah Palin, the anti-word-mincing human megaphone who was once a vice presidential candidate and the GOP's best hope for a new female vanguard, said Wednesday that she doesn't 'give a flying flip' if a woman wins the White House.

The change of heart comes as Democrat Hillary Clinton is poised to break a glass ceiling and become America's first 'Madame President' after serving as first lady, a U.S. senator, secretary of state and the GOP's favorite punching bag.

'I don't give a flying flip about what gender the person will be,' Palin told Norville, who asked her if electing a female president was important.

'I want the absolute best because America deserves the best, in terms of leadership, getting this country on the right track.'

Sarah Palin said she doesn't 'give a flying flip' if a woman becomes president but admits it would be nice.

SEEMS SO LONG AGO: Palin was Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate in 2008 and lost to President Barack Obama and VP Joe Biden

'But yeah, it would be nice,' she finally admitted, 'and it will be nice to see women jump into the ring.'

The interview aired the same day the Pew Research Center published a survey of more than 1.800 American adults, asking questions about the leadership roles of women in modern society.

Pew found that 73 per cent of them expect to see a female president in their lifetimes – but only 38 per cent say they hope it happens.

Another 57 per cent say it doesn't matter to them either way.

There's also a strong split on the issue along party lines.

'Democratic women in particular are strong proponents of female political leaders,' Pew reported. 'In most cases, they are more likely than both Democratic men and Republican women to say that female political leaders do a better job [than] men.'

'Among Democratic women, fully 69 per cent say they hope the U.S. will elect a female president in their lifetime,' the survey's writers said.

'This compares with 46 per cent of Democratic men, 20 per cent of Republican women and 16 per cent of Republican men.'

But for many Republicans, Pew adds, 'this view may be more about the prospect of a Hillary Clinton presidency than about a major milestone for women.'

Palin was more enthusiastic a month ago about seeing Y-chromosomes frozen out of America's ultimate political prize in 2016.

'I would love to see a woman on both sides of the aisle shooting for that top spot,' she told Extra TV in early December – when asked specifically about Clinton’s likely candidacy.

She has also trotted out her 'flying flip' euphemism before.

In November 2013 at the height of the Obamacare website crisis, she told Newsmax TV that the project's online woes were the least of her concerns.

'I don't give a flying flip about a malfunctioning website,' Palin snarked. 'A broken website is the least of our worries. The greater worry is what Obamacare is all about.' 

The U.S. has a storied history of women running for president and vice president, although most Americans' knowledge of the history doesn't stretch back further than the modern era.

In addition to Palin's VP run in 2008 as Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain's running mate, Democrat Geraldine Ferraro took an equally futile shot at the VP race in 1984 with Walter Mondale in the top slot.

TRAILBLAZERS: In 1872 Victoria Woodhull (left) ran for president under the Equal Rights Party banner; the legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass was her vice presidential running mate

In 2012 two women ran for president – Minnesota's then-congresswoman Michele Bachmann and famed TV loudmouth comic Roseann Barr, who came in second among delegates for the Green Party nomination.

That prize went to another woman, physician Jill Stein.

Overall more than 80 women have been candidates for the U.S. presidency, and another 60 have sought the second-banana job.

The first came in 1872 when Victoria Woodhull ran for president under the Equal Rights Party banner. The legendary abolitionist Frederick Douglass was her running mate.

The two failed to win electoral votes from any states, but they laid important groundwork both for women and for African-Americans – Douglass was an escaped black slave before winning fame as an orator, social reformer and statesman. 

Ferraro and Palin, though, share the distinction of becoming their parties' official nominees for the vice presidency, a feat no other woman has matched. And no female has led the Democrats or the Republicans into a presidential election at the top of the ticket.
