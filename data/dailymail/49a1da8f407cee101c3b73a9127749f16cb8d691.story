Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has rejected an offer to become the new coach of Brazil, according to reports in his native Chile.

It has been claimed that Pellegrini was approached as the World Cup reached its climax on Sunday, 24 hours before Luiz Felipe Scolari quit following a calamitous end to Brazil’s bid to win the tournament on home soil.

However, Pellegrini is said to have refused to enter into negotiations with the Brazilian FA, insisting that he wants to see out his three-year contract at the Etihad.
