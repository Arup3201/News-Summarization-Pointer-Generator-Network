A hedge fund billionaire who is attempting to prohibit his wife from getting her hands on much of his fortune in their divorce proceedings has recently hired a new lawyer - for his three minor children.

Kenneth Griffin, 45, had asked the court to appoint a children’s representative in his divorce against his wife of 11 years, Anne Dias-Griffin, and now both sides have agreed on an attorney for their children.

This comes as Mr. Griffin, 45, is trying to get away with only paying out what he laid out in the couple's prenup, a cash settlement that amounts to about one percent of his wealth, and does not include real estate or the couple's art collection.

His worth is estimated to be around $5.6 billion according to Bloomberg News. 

He founded the hedge fund Citadel LLC in 1990, which now manages roughly $16 billion in assets.

Mrs. Dias-Griffin claims she was coerced into signing the prenup, and has filed a petition with the court saying she did not have a chance to fully read the document before agreeing to it back in 2003.

Their wedding ceremony took place in Versailles, France, as a two-day blowout that featured performances by Cirque du Soleil and  Donna Summer.

As it pertains to the three minor children, ages six, four and two, Mrs. Dias-Griffin in seeking sole custody with 'reasonable visitation,' while her husband is asking for joint custody, according to the Chicago Tribune. 

In most divorce cases, support payments vary based on custody arrangements. 

Chicago lawyer Joel Levin of Levin & Associates to has been chosen to serve as 'guardian ad litem' for the couple's kids.

The duties of the guardian ad litem include investigating the facts of the case, interviewing the children, their parents, and other relevant parties, and submitting a written report to the court.

Levin has previously worked with the children of famous actors and athletes.

No money, more problems: Mrs. Dias-Griffin is set to get a small percentage of her husband's wealth in their divorce, but no real estate, such  their $130 million Palm Beach estates (right), or  art, like this $80 million Jasper Johns (left)

Mr. Griffin filed for divorce in July of this year while his wife was on vacation in London with the children.

He and his wife had been separated since February of 2012.

Mrs. Dias-Griffin was a prominent name in the financial world herself, starting Aragon Global Management, LLC in 2001. 

She left in 2009 however to focus on her family.

Among the real estate  holdings Mrs. Dias-Griffin does not have any claim to according to the prenup are a $15 million penthouse condo at the Park Tower in Chicago, four Palm Beach properties worth $130 million, and a vast Balinese-style, beach-front property at the Hualalai resort in Hawaii which was purchased in 2011 for around $17 million.
