Women jurors are a recent phenomenon in U.S. history and until the 1960s, numerous states still prohibited women jurors as the thinking was that women's place was in the home, not in the jury box.

A jury of six women, five of them 
white and the other a minority, decided George Zimmerman was not guilty 
in the shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin.

Now, many are now asking are questioning how the all-female jury affected the outcome of the trial.

The women have spoken: George Zimmerman smiles after a not guilty verdict was handed down in his trial

The jurors were chosen during a nine-day selection process are known only by numbers to protect their identities.

They ranged in age from their 30s to their 60s; one is Hispanic or black and the others are white. Five of the women are mothers.

Before the trial began, one defense expert stated that the six women chosen to sit on the jury could be sympathetic to George Zimmerman's fate, although their views on guns, crime and community are more relevant in the deliberation room than their gender.

Jose Baez, a Florida defense attorney who was lead defense counsel on the Casey Anthony case said an all-female jury was a 'slam-dunk' for the defense from the very start.

'I think the defense clearly won the day on this one,' Baez said. 'Any way you slice and dice it, this is a defense jury.'

The trial wasn't a typical criminal case in that the women weren't be tasked with weighing whether George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin, but whether he was justified in killing the teen.

For the female jurors, it is their understanding of when it's appropriate to use deadly force that was key.

Two of the women reported they were familiar with guns. One even had the same kind of permit to carry a concealed weapon that Zimmerman was issued.

Another of the jurors warned her two adolescent children not to go out at night because of Martin's shooting.

The fact that five were white, and one was Hispanic was probably more of a boost for the defense than the fact they were women.

During the trial they were known only by numbers, but their names will be released sometime later.

County for nine years working in real estate and run a call center where

Relief: George Zimmerman's family celebrate as the jury clear him of all charges

Brian Tannebaum, president of the Florida Association of Bar Defense Lawyers and past president of the Florida Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers agreed.

'There's always that notion of men and women viewing things differently - that women can be more sympathetic, or can listen better than men,' Tannebaum said. 'But I have no idea how to gauge a jury in a case like this, where the facts are not your typical facts.'

Holly McCammon, a professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University believes that the all-female jury  had no effect on the ultimate decision in this case.

'Research shows that no one juror trait, including gender, is an accurate indicator of how a juror will vote,' she says.

'The best predictor of whether a juror will side with the prosecution or defense is a mix of gender, race, ethnicity, religion, political ideology, personality and attitudes.'

Ms. McCammonis the author of 'The U.S. Women's Jury Movements and Strategic Adaptation: A More Just Verdict.'

She believes that the gender makeup of juries rarely shapes the verdict in a trial.

George Zimmerman listens to the charges against him read by Judge Debra Nelson, in Seminole circuit court during his trial

'Women are now full citizens when it 
comes to jury service. If a man is being tried by an all-woman jury, he 
is likely being tried by a jury of his peers.

The
gender makeup of the jury is not likely to be pivotal in determining 
the verdict in the Zimmerman trial. The evidence is what matters in the 
outcome.

But our public
attention to the fact of an all-female jury shows that we are still 
conditioned to think in gendered ways,' she says.

At
the time the jury was selected, Ben Crump, a lawyer for the Martin 
family, said, 'With the makeup of this jury, the issue of whether every 
American can get equal justice no matter who serves on this jury panel 
will be answered. And we expect the jury pool to do its duty and follow 
the law,' he said.

Prosecutors and defense attorneys chose the panel of six jurors after almost two weeks of jury selection.

In Florida, 12 jurors are required only for criminal trials involving capital cases, when the death penalty is being considered.

Martin's
shooting death and the initial decision not to charge Zimmerman led to 
public outrage and demonstrations around the nation, with some accusing 
Sanford police of failing to thoroughly investigate the shooting.

The six jurors were culled from a pool of 40 jury candidates.

A jury made up entire from women allows armchair trial lawyers to speculate on how gender might have influenced the verdict.

Did
the women sympathize with someone who claimed to be in fear for his 
life? Two of the female jurors themselves own guns for self-defense.

Did they sympathize with the tragic loss of a teenage son? Five of the jurors are mothers.

These
questions evoke the larger and largely unspoken issue at the heart of 
any jury selection - do women decide cases differently?
