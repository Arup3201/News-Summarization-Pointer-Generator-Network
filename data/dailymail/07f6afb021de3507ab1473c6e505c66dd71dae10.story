The remarkable story of how a young woman was ordered to host a party on the eve of D-Day to help calm the nerves of military commanders has emerged after 70 years.

Stella Broughton, now Stella Rutter, was given the same security clearance as Winston Churchill by British army chief General Montgomery so she could stage the secret event.

The then 20-year-old was also told to circulate among top military commanders to make conversation - but had strict instructions not to mention the war.

Stella Rutter, then Stella Broughton, was called upon to organise a secret party for top military commanders on the night before D-Day

Mrs Rutter, now 91, has told of the party for the first time after swearing not to talk about it for at least 60 years

The informal party was held on the night of June 3, 1944 and was organised to take the minds of the senior officers off the momentous event that lay ahead of them.

Over 60 commanding officers, including US General Omar Bradley, were at the gathering, where many met one another for the first time ahead of the huge operation.

Stella made sure they had enough to eat and drink - including alcohol - and danced with them to a band.

During the war, Stella was the only woman draughtswoman to work for Spitfire makers, Supermarine, and proved she could be trusted with sensitive information.

Her mother brought her up not to repeat gossip, another reason why she was placed on the top secret BIGOT list, which stood for British Invasion of German Occupied Territory.

Stella was told in advance when the D-Day landings would happen and learned the names of regiments, commanders and codenames of the Normandy beaches at the party.

The party was held in a sunken Nissen hut at Hursley Park, near Winchester, Hampshire, where Supermarine was based.

It was meant to have been held the evening before the start of the D-Day operation in June 1944.

But Operation Overlord was delayed for 24 hours due to poor weather and paratroopers were dropped into Normandy on the night of June 5 and the landings were on June 6.

Stella was told not to mention the party for the next 60 years when all the commanders involved had died.

Now aged 91, the widow, from Emsworth, Hampshire, has written an autobiography about her career.

The book, titled 'Tomorrow is D-Day', is her own wartime story and is based on the meticulous notes and diaries she kept at the time.

Now a great-grandmother, she was the first woman ever employed in the drawing office at Supermarine and was there when she was approached by Major General Douglas Graham who was in command of Gold beach on D-Day.

Montgomery had asked Graham to organise the party and find a suitable and trusted hostess.

She said: 'Montgomery wanted a woman to host it and not an official in order to cut the protocol and force the men to make an effort not to speak about the war or D-Day.

'He got in touch with Supermarine and asked if they had a lady who can keep her mouth shut and that lady was me.

'I had been taught since the age of five never to repeat what I heard from others and Iknew how to keep my mouth shut.

'Everyone knew that the invasion of Europe would happen at some point and how everything depended on it, but nobody knew when or where.

'The commanding officers were told on the morning of the party and Montgomery wanted them to be put at ease, to relax and get a good night's sleep and came up with this informal party.

'It was also held so many of them men could meet each other before they went into the field of battle.

'I knew the names of all the commanders of D-Day, the regiments that were going to be involved, the ships and the codenames for the beaches.

'I was asked not to recall what happened on the night for at least 60 years when everyone involved was dead and I never mentioned it to anyone, not even my husband.

'I had to greet every man as they arrived and I was asked to converse with them for 10 to 20 minutes each.

Stella is now telling the inside story of her war in her book 'Tomorrow is D-Day'

'I could 
feel some of them were jittery when I shook their hands. I made a point 
of calling them mister rather than by their title or rank.

'I spoke to them about traveling abroad, visiting art galleries and museums I spoke about anything apart from the war.

'One US officer broke down on the dance floor and he was shuffled out of the room straight away so that the others didn't see.

'There were buffet tables stacked full of food. There were whole roasted chickens, a baron of beef, a whole leg of lamb and a huge joint of pork.

'On another table there was all the drink you could imagine, apart from Champagne. There were different brands of whisky and gin, wine, liqueurs and beers.

'The men were drinking but nobody was drunk. People said what a jolly good do it was.'

As well as Lt Gen Bradley who commanded the US First Army, the commanders of the five Normandy beaches were at the party, including Maj Gen Graham, Maj Gen Thomas Rennie and Maj Gen Rodney Keller.

Stella carried on working at Supermarine and left there after the war when she married husband Sydney.

Her book 'Tomorrow is D-Day' is published by Amberley and costs Â£16.99.

On June 6, 1944, Allied forces, led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, stormed the beaches of Normandy, France, on 'D-Day', beginning the liberation of German-occupied Western Europe during World War II.

The Normandy landings, codenamed Operation Neptune, were the beginning of Operation Overlord, the Allies' assault on German-occupied territory.

The mission was the largest amphibious invasion in history with over 160,000 soldiers, including 73,000 Americans, 61,715 British and 21,400 Canadians, involved and over 5,000 ships.

There was an initial airborne assault with 24,000 troops being parachuted into France before the sea landings began at dawn.

The Normandy coast was split into five sectors for the attack - Juno, Sword, Gold, Omaha and Utah.

The timing of the operation was crucial, with commanders needing the right weather, a full moon and the correct tidal conditions.

On D-Day alone, around 4,400 Allied troops died with a further 9,000 wounded or missing. Total German casualties are estimated at between 4,000 and 9,000.

The landings were a turning point in the war, opening up a second front - the Russians were already advancing on Germany from the east - and leading to the liberation of occupied Europe.

'The tide has turned. The free men of the world are marching together to victory!' Eisenhower said in an historic address after the invasion was launched.

Last year, tourist boards along the Normandy coast launched the new D-Day initiative to promote what it calls the 'Secteur mythique' - where much of the action took place.
