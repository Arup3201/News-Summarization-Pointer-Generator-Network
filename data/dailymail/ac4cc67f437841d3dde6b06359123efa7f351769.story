Ryanair has been told it must look after passengers when flights are grounded by natural catastrophes, strikes and technical faults.

The European Court of Justice ruling yesterday means the airline must cover the cost of meals, hotels and transport.

The case dates back to the disruption caused by the eruption of a volcano in Iceland in 2010.

Angry: Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary said that the European Court of Justice's ruling may cause some airlines to go bust

Passengers were stranded across Europe. Ryanair alone cancelled 9,400 flights due to the ash cloud.

The ruling is a blow to Ryanair boss 
Michael O’Leary, who at first refused to abide by EU laws which state 
airlines should support stranded passengers until they fly them home.

After pressure from ministers, he was 
forced into a U-turn, but Ryanair then became embroiled in a legal 
battle to limit future refunds.

The ECJ ruling follows on from a 
British court’s decision earlier this week to allow passengers to claim 
damages after long delays, as reported in the Daily Mail yesterday.

The ruling was made after passenger Denise McDonagh was stranded in Faro, Portugal after volcano Eyjafjallajokull erupted.

She claimed 1,130 Euros, or £970, to cover costs incurred while she was stuck.

The volcanic eruption left millions of passengers unable to return home because it was deemed too dangerous to fly through the ash clouds.

Today's ruling could leave airlines open to a raft of future claims.

The court recognised compensation claims could have 'substantial negative economic consequences' for airlines, but said a high level of protection must be afforded to passengers.

The court also said airlines should foresee any costs but pointed out that ticket prices could be hiked as a result.

Mr O'Leary said the court's decision made the airlines 'insurers of last resort' and said whoever was responsible for cancellations should pay compensation.

He blamed the Government for closing British airspace in 2010, even though 'there was clearly no ash cloud over the UK.'

He said: 'We now have a position that when the next time there's an ash cloud or the skies are closed by Europe's governments, the travel insurance companies will walk away and wash their hands and say it was an act of God and the airlines will become the insurers of last resort.'

'Somebody who has paid us fifty quid to travel to the Canaries, who may be stuck there for two weeks, two months, six months, will now sue the airlines and you will have airlines going out of business, and the ones who stay in business will be putting up the air fares to recover these crazy claims.'

Mr O'Leary said Ryanair had paid out to everyone affected by the volcano eruption in 2010, including Ms McDonagh, but had still not covered costs despite introducing a compensation surcharge.

He added: 'It's a crazy decision, it's another crazy decision coming from the European court.

'You can't expect us to be providing compensation for the world and his mother when we are prevented from flying.

'Why does somebody have to pay? Why do we take responsibility for something that has been caused by others?

'This compensation culture is running riot in this country.'

The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) today reiterated its advice to passengers affected by flight delays and cancellations and advised passengers who were not being treated properly to contact them.

Passengers whose flights are delayed or cancelled are entitled to assistance from the airline such as food, drinks and accommodation where necessary, the CAA said.

In addition, passengers whose flights have been cancelled at short notice or arrive three hours or more later than scheduled are also entitled to claim for compensation - unless the delay or cancellation was out of the airline's control.

A CAA spokesman said: 'These regulations are in place to protect people when things go wrong with their flights.

'Anyone with concerns that they are not being treated correctly by their airline can contact the CAA for advice or to make a complaint.'

Ryanair also issued an official statement this afternoon warning of hikes in fares after the ruling.

It read: 'Ryanair regrets the decision of the European Court which now allows passengers to claim for flight delays which are clearly and unambiguously outside of an airline's control.

'Today's decision will materially increase the cost of flying across Europe and consumer airfares will increase as airlines will be obliged to recover the cost of these claims from their customers, because the defective European regulation does not allow us to recover such costs from the governments or unions who are responsible for over 95 per cent of flight delays in Europe.'

Like other carriers, the airline said it had already paid out millions of pounds in compensation to passengers affected by the ash cloud.

But it contested Ms McDonagh's case because it deemed the amount to be 'excessive'.

The case centred around the EU 261 regulations, a European law which means carriers were obliged to refund the bills of thousands of passengers caught up in the crisis which put a ban on great swathes of airspace.

It was seen as a test case as Ryanair was the only airline to take a challenge to the European courts.

Last October the European Court decided that delays of more than three hours, where the airline was at fault - because of technical faults or lack of flight crew, for example - warranted compensation.

With 200million passengers using UK airports annually, and around 2million of those delayed by more than three hours, that may result in 400,000 fliers eligible for refunds every year.

British Airways, easyJet, Tui Travel and the International Air Transport Association (IATA) had all opposed that ruling.

Compensation to British customers was put on hold until the final ruling in October.
