Twin sisters ended up delivering their newborn sons this weekend, on the exact same day within just a few hours of each other, at the same hospital in Missouri.

Jessica Penrose and her twin sister, Andrea Elliott, spent the past nine months on their second pregnancies together.

When Jessica learned she was going to have her second baby, she called her mom and they drove over to tell her twin Andrea.

But Andrea had some big news of her own, telling her family that she was also pregnant and due within days of her twin sister.

'Our pregnancies basically mirrored each others’, said Andrea. 'We had the same kind of morning sickness and the same aches and pains. So I had someone to call who literally knew how I was feeling right then.'

Their doctor Dr. Christina Litherland even offered to induce them on the same day but the twins each decided they would give birth on different days so they could be there for each others' delivery.

With their first sons, the sisters had been in the delivery room with each other.

However, before the scheduled inductions could happen, Andrea went into labor early Saturday morning.

Sister Jessica had planned to follow her sister to the hospital a short time later to attend the delivery, but then her own water broke and she began having contractions.

'My water broke. Before I knew it, I was headed in to have my son, too.'

With both sisters in labor, Dr. Litherland ended up running run back and forth between the labor rooms to deliver the baby boys. 'It was just amazing,' she said.

Andrea welcomed her son Hampton first, followed by Jessica’s son, Dawson, four hours later.

'I actually wheeled down there so I could be in the room with Jessica,' said Andrea. 'How often do you get that chance?'

The sisters can add another joint birthday party to their list of social events and say while it wasn’t what they would’ve chosen, it turned out just right.

Happy families: The twins, Jessica and Andrea pictures with their husbands, Brandon and Jeremy, their two little boys and their parents too!
