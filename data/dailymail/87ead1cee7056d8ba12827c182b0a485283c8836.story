Ian Poulter has received a grovelling apology from sacked PGA of America president Ted Bishop, who had branded the Ryder Cup star a ‘lil girl’.

Bishop was given the boot after firing off a series of abusive tweets and Facebook comments aimed at Poulter.

He was reacting to the English Ryder Cup hero’s critical comments about Tom Watson and Nick Faldo in his recently published autobiography. Comparing Faldo’s superior major and Ryder Cup record with Poulter’s, Bishop had tweeted: ‘Yours v His? Lil Girl.’

Poulter hit back at the 38th PGA president, labelling the comments ‘pretty shocking and disappointing’, and on Friday the PGA of America announced it had voted to relieve Bishop of his duties.

Poulter said the comments made by Bishop were 'disappointing for the leader of the PGA of America'

Bishop has since apologised, saying: ‘This is a classic example of poor use of social media on my part and if I had the chance to hit the delete button on the things that I sent out yesterday, I would without hesitation.’

The row was sparked by comments in Poulter’s book No Limits, in which he branded Watson’s captaincy at Gleneagles last month as ‘utterly bizarre’ and also reopened an old feud with Faldo.

European captain at the 2008 Ryder Cup, Faldo said while commentating on this year’s match that Sergio Garcia was ‘useless’ during the loss to the United States at Valhalla six years ago.  

Poulter said Sir Nick Faldo has lost a lot of respect from players because of his comments about Sergio Garcia

The Englishman also hit out at Tom Watson for dropping Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley at the Ryder Cup 

Noting it was Europe’s only loss in the past 15 years and that Faldo was captain, Poulter wrote: ‘So who’s useless? I think Faldo might need to have a little look in the mirror.’

In Bishop’s tweet, which has since been deleted, he retorted: ‘Faldo’s record stands by itself. Six majors and all-time RC points. Yours vs. His? Lil Girl.’

Poulter, who has yet to triumph in a major, said: ‘Is being called a “lil girl” meant to be derogatory or a put down? That’s pretty shocking and disappointing, especially coming from the leader of the PGA of America.’
