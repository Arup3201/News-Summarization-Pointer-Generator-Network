The moon may seem like a placid, barren satellite today, but it was once host to a series of violent volcanoes that scarred its surface.

For decades, researchers have believed rivers of magma flowed on the moon around a billion years ago, and then stopped abruptly.

But a new study suggests volcanic activity was still present on the moon 100 million years ago – the same time that dinosaurs were roaming the Earth.

The feature called Maskelyne is one of many newly discovered young volcanic deposits on the moon. Called irregular mare patches, these areas are thought to be remnants of small volcanic eruptions that occurred much later than the commonly accepted end of lunar volcanism, 1 to 1.5 billion years ago

If confirmed, the finding could suggest the presence of radioactive elements keeping the moon's insides warm.

The discovery was made using images from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which suggest a number of lunar rock deposits were less than 100 million years old.

'This finding is the kind of science that is literally going to make geologists rewrite the textbooks about the moon,' said John Keller, LRO project scientist.

The deposits are scattered across the moon's dark volcanic plains and are characterised by a mixture of smooth, rounded, shallow mounds next to patches of rough, blocky terrain.

This image shows the moon seen in visible light (left), topography (centre, where red is high and blue is low), and gravity gradients (right). The Procellarum region is a broad region of low topography which was formed by volcanic activity. Some activity may still have occurred on the lunar surface 100 million years ago

Because of this combination of textures, the researchers refer to these unusual areas as irregular mare patches.

The features are too small to be seen from Earth, averaging less than a third of a mile (0.5km) across in their largest dimension.

One of the largest, a well-studied area called Ina, was imaged from lunar orbit by Apollo 15 astronauts.

Ina appeared to be a one-of-a-kind feature until researchers from Arizona State University in Tempe and Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität Münster in Germany spotted similar regions in high-resolution images taken by LRO.

The team identified a total of 70 irregular mare patches on the near side of the moon.

The findings have major implications for how warm the moon's interior is thought to be.'The existence and age of the irregular mare patches tell us that the lunar mantle had to remain hot enough to provide magma for the small-volume eruptions that created these unusual young features,' said lead author Sarah Braden

The large number of these features and their wide distribution strongly suggest that late-stage volcanic activity was not an anomaly but an important part of the moon's geologic history.

A recent study has found that the famous shapes that make up the 'man in the moon' are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface.

The 1,800-mile-wide (2,897km) section of the moon’s Procellarum basin was formed by large plumes of molten rock, the US scientists believe.

The latest theory, published in the journal Nature, was established by analysing high-definition maps of the moon’s surface.

Using Nasa data, a research team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) found that the circles are not circular - as would be the case if they were caused by asteroids.

The researchers discovered that they are instead made up of sharp angles produced by giant tension cracks in the moon’s crust as it cooled around upwelling plumes of hot material from the deep interior.

The numbers and sizes of the craters within these areas indicate the deposits are relatively recent.

Based on a technique that links such crater measurements to the ages of Apollo and Luna samples, three of the irregular mare patches are thought to be less than 100 million years old, and perhaps less than 50 million years old in the case of Ina.

The steep slopes leading down from the smooth rock layers to the rough terrain are consistent with the young age estimates.

In contrast, the volcanic plains surrounding these distinctive regions are attributed to volcanic activity that started about 3.5 billion years ago and ended roughly 1 billion years ago.

The findings have major implications for how warm the moon's interior is thought to be.

'The existence and age of the irregular mare patches tell us that the lunar mantle had to remain hot enough to provide magma for the small-volume eruptions that created these unusual young features,' said Sarah Braden, a recent Arizona State University graduate and the lead author of the study.

The new information is hard to reconcile with what currently is thought about the temperature of the interior of the moon.

'These young volcanic features are prime targets for future exploration, both robotic and human,' said Mark Robinson, LROC principal investigator at Arizona State University.

The shapes making up the 'face' of the man in the moon are likely to have been created by magma bubbling up to the moon’s surface, new research reveals. This image shows a full moon as seen from the Earth, with the Procellarum border structures of 'face' superimposed in red
