A 88 year-old poster advertising an appearance of baseball legend Babe Ruth is set to go to auction, after being found in a demolished Minnesota home. The poster will reportedly fetch more than $20,000.

The 14-by-22 inch poster, promotes a June 16, 1926 exhibition appearance of Ruth and the New York Yankees, pitting them against the St. Paul Saints, an AAA minor league team from the American Association. 

The cardstock poster, which curiously lists the icon as 'Ruth Babe,' was discovered as the owner's home was being demolished.

'As the walls were being knocked down, he noticed it within the paper insulation,'  Chris Ivy, Director of Sports Collectibles with Heritage Auctions, told FoxNews.com. Heritage Auctions is handling the sale of the poster.

According to Ivy, who said that the poster was the only surviving one for the event, he told the owner of the poster soon after the find that 'he found a diamond in the rough.'

The poster reportedly falls into the most common categories for sports collectibles, as it is not only a New York Yankees/baseball collectible, but it's a Babe Ruth collectible, the first larger-than-life superstar of American sports.

According to Heritage Auctions, the game was scheduled to happen at Lexington Park, in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was an exhibition game scheduled in between games against the St. Louis Browns and Chicago White Sox. However, the game was rained out, and the Great Bambino instead put on his own show, treating fans to a batting practice.

Despite the rarity and expected value of this poster, it is dwarfed in comparison to other pieces of Babe Ruth memorabilia. According to a February 24 press release, Heritage Auctions sold a watch presented to the Sultan of Swat for the Yankees' 1923 World Championship victory for $717,000.

In the release, Ivy called the watch 'the most important piece of New York Yankees memorabilia that exists.'
