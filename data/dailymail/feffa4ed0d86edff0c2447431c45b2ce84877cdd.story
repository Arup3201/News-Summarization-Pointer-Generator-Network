A judge on Tuesday ordered jurors in the Jodi Arias case to keep deliberating after her lawyers said the panel had reached an impasse on whether to sentence her to death or life in prison for killing her lover in 2008.

Arias, now 34, was convicted of first-degree murder in 2013 after a lengthy trial that became a sensation with its tawdry revelations about her relationship with victim Travis Alexander. That jury deadlocked on her punishment.

Authorities said Alexander, 30, was found dead in the shower of his Mesa home after Arias shot him in the forehead and slit his throat so deeply that he was nearly decapitated.

On Tuesday, Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens denied a request by Arias' attorneys for a mistrial and instead read additional jury instructions to the jury in her sentencing retrial.

The jury had deliberated about 17 hours over four days.

Deadlocked: A lawyer for Jodi Arias says jurors at her sentencing retrial are at an impasse over whether to sentence the convicted murderer to life in prison or death for the 2008 killing of her lover. Arias is seen here in court on February 24 

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi pleaded for Arias' (pictured with defense attorney Jennifer Willmott) life during his closing arguments last Tuesday, saying she was physically and emotionally abused by Alexander

Defense attorney Kirk Nurmi said in court that jurors were at an impasse, though the judge and prosecutor Juan Martinez never confirmed that in open court.

Jurors posed two questions to Stephens, who didn't reveal details. The judge and lawyers held closed-door discussions shortly before jurors were brought into the courtroom.

Stephens told them that she didn't intend to force a verdict and said in her instructions that jurors shouldn't weigh evidence based on the views of other jurors.

If the current jury can't decide on a sentence, the death penalty would be removed as an option and the judge would decide if Arias serves life in prison or gets a chance for release after 25 years. 

Last week, Nurmi pleaded Arias' life, saying she was physically and emotionally abused as a child and by former boyfriend Alexander.

Nurmi said Alexander was a conflicted Mormon, who used Arias to satisfy his sexual desires and called her 'soulless'.

'Those words have impact and they got to her,' Nurmi said.

If the jury reaches deadlock, the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Sherry Stephens (pictured on Feb 24) will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years

Martinez described Arias as a liar who was trying to trick the jury into believing she was the victim.

He then pointed to the photograph of Alexander's decomposed body, covered in stab wounds, his throat cut and a gunshot wound to the forehead. 

'That's what she wants you to believe,' he said. 'But actually, in reality, it's this.' 

Alexander's family and friends sobbed in the courtroom as the gruesome photographs were displayed. 

So concluded the five-month sentencing phase that was much quieter than the 2013 murder trial that made Arias a cable television and tabloid sensation. 

Arias stabbed Alexander nearly 30 times, nearly decapitated him when she slit his throat and shot him in the forehead in an act she claimed was in self-defense. 

Alexander's body was found in the shower of his Phoenix home by his friends five days later. 

Prosecutors said Arias had planned the murder in advance because she was jealous Alexander wanted to break up with her and was planning a trip to Mexico with another woman.

Arias claimed Alexander was abusive and obsessed with sex.

After she was convicted of murder, Arias said during a jailhouse interview with Fox that she desired the death penalty because it was the 'ultimate freedom'.

Arias was convicted of first-degree murder for the death of Alexander in 2008. She claimed she killed him in an act of self-defense, while prosecutors claimed she murdered him in a jealous rage

But the trial's jury deadlocked when debating Arias ultimate fate, requiring a second sentencing phase. 

Arias' new trial began in October and Judge Sherry Stephens banned news organizations from live broadcasting the case.

She ruled that court proceedings could only be aired after the verdict, which  can be aired live.

In November, Arias pleaded for her life in front of the jury.

The judge allowed her to testify in secret and sealed the testimony to the public, but transcripts were released after news organizations complained and an appeals court threw out the decision.

If Arias receives the death penalty she will be only the third woman on death row in Arizona. 

The new jury of eight woman and four men left for the day on Wednesday without having reached a decision. 

If they reach deadlock the death penalty will automatically be thrown out as an option and Judge Stephens will sentence Arias either to life in prison or life with the possibility of parole after 25 years.
