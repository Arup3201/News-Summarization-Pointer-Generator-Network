Many teams have tried to replicate the playing style of the dominant tiki-taka Barcelona side, but Charlton Athletic are taking it one step further by imitating the Catalan giants' 'tequila sunrise' kit.

The Addicks unveiled their new away strip on Friday and it would have looked awfully familiar for fans of La Liga.

That's because the new kit looks just like the orange and yellow blend that Barca sported back in the 2012/13 season.

New clothes: Charlton will wear this new 'tequila sunrise' design on their travels next season

Are you Barca in disguise? Cesc Fabregas, Lionel Messi and Xavi might not be heading for The Valley

And Charlton fans will be hoping it brings them the same luck that the Catalans enjoyed. Lionel Messi and co lost just twice in all competitions while wearing the eye-catching uniform.

New manager Bob Peeters is hoping to improve fortunes at The Valley this season after a disappointing campaign last time round.

And if they can play anything like Barcelona - even the misfiring version of last year - Addicks fans will have an exciting season in store.

Unmissable: Joe Gomez and co will stand out on the pitch in the Championship next season

Eye catching: Jordan Cousins keeps his eye on the ball but fans might be distracted by the kit
