Many companies enforce a 'dress down Friday' policy as an incentive for office workers to let their hair down at the end of the week.

But according to new research, for many the opposite effect is achieved as people get stressed about what to wear on their day 'off' from the office uniform.

Deadlines and budgets aside, one in ten 
workers cite dress down Friday as the most stressful time of the week 
and 15 per cent become so stressed by what to wear they even call in 
sick.

Although dress down Friday seems like a welcome break from the suited attire of every other day, Brits find it the most stressful day of the week and many are dressing ready for a night out on the town

Nearly a quarter have even been late due to indecision and one in five have returned home to change after leaving the house.

Careful planning is essential with one third of us beginning to plan our Friday outfit on Thursday lunchtime with one percent beginning the decision-making process as early as Monday evening.

And it seems that 'dressing down' requires a lot more effort than meets the eye with a staggering 43 per cent spending more time on hair, makeup and grooming on a Friday compared to any other day of the working week, with 24 per cent choosing the day to experiment with their look. 

This experimentation, which adds an average of fifteen minutes to an individual’s morning routine, has also had an effect on our pockets as 50 per cent claim to spend more on their Friday fashion than they do for the remainder of the week.

Mini-skirts have become a norm on dress down Friday as many people gear up for the night ahead and hit the town straight after work

And it seems that the office is increasingly becoming a catwalk with high heels over four inches, party dresses and mini skirts all seen as acceptable Friday attire, especially for the 50 per cent of those surveyed who claim to go straight out from work every week.

With 15 per cent of men claiming to have pulled a colleague aside to tell them about a Friday fashion faux pas, and one in five women admitting to whispering at the water cooler behind a colleague’s back, it’s not surprising that more than one in ten of us have enlisted the advice of a professional stylist over what to wear to work.

'It's a dilemma that can be easily solved with a few individual items that can be mixed and matched to create that killer, day-to-night combo' says Very.co.uk ambassador Fearne Cotton

The study, carried out by leading online fashion retailer Very.co.uk, found that regionally, those in Birmingham and the West Midlands are the least confident in choosing their outfits alone, with 53 per cent of respondents asking partners, 38 per cent asking family members and nearly a quarter asking complete strangers for style advice.

Brand ambassador for Very.co.uk Fearne Cotton said: 'We’ve all been there, rummaging through drawers and trying to find the outfit that makes you look fabulous without looking like you’ve tried too hard. 

'It’s a dilemma that millions of us face every week that can be easily solved with a few individual items that can be mixed and matched to create that killer, day-to-night combo.'

Julie Donnelly, head of womenswear buying at Very.co.uk added: 'The pressure to look good in the office has never been more intense, and with 51 per cent of people claiming to go straight out from work on a Friday, day-to-night fashion like our latest range of party dresses, is proving increasingly popular.'
