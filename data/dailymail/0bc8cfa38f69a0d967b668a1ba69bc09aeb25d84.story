Fears are growing that Greece will miss its deficit targets despite plans to axe 30,000 civil service jobs by the end of the year.

The Greek cabinet today finalised details of drastic cuts aimed at saving £6.9billion so it can receive the final installment of its 2010 bail out.

The FTSE 100 Index in London closed just over a percentage point down at 5,075.50, after a day of fluctuating above and below the 5000 mark, after Greece admitted it will miss its deficit reduction targets.

That means London's blue-chip shares index has continued its dire performance after enduring its worst quarter in nine years, with about 14 per cent wiped off its value in the three months to the end of September.

It was a similar story across world 
markets today, with the Dax in Frankfurt also down following on from a poor performance in the Asian markets.

The Greek government's admission that it will miss its tough deficit reduction targets cast fresh doubts as to whether it will be allowed the next tranche of its £94.4billion bailout.

The debt-stricken country has previously warned that, if it does not receive the money, it could go bankrupt within weeks, which would cause financial chaos.

Meanwhile, reports that Belgian bank Dexia is in need of a government bailout added to fears about the health of the banking sector.

As
 the cost of insuring bank debts across the world rose to levels not 
seen since the financial crisis, there is now speculation of another 
credit crunch as confidence in lending dries up.

Traders
 are worried that political leaders do not seem to be able to tackle the
 problems of high debt and slowing economic growth in many western 
nations, which have plagued markets for months.

The
 Greek parliament meeting follows three days of talks with its creditors
 - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the 
International Monetary Fund about a government proposal that the civil 
service cuts will come mainly from placing staff nearing retirement age 
on 'reserve,' or suspending them at reduced pay.

State
 workers who make up a fifth of the Greek workforce are guaranteed jobs 
for life under a constitution that bans firing government employees in 
virtually all circumstances.

Under
 the plan, the sacked workers workers would be put in the reserve by the
 end of this year and paid 60 per cent of their salaries for a year, 
after which they would be dismissed. 

The money at stake is the release of 
£6.9billion - the sixth installment of a £94billion bailout package 
agreed on in May last year, to save Greece from defaulting on its debt.

Greece sees its 2011 budget deficit reaching 8.5 percent of GDP this year, missing a 7.6 percent target.

The
 2012 budget draft foresees that the deficit will be brought down to 6.8
 percent of GDP next year, above a 6.5 percent target in the bailout 
that saved Greece from bankruptcy. 

Speaking
 to a Sunday newspaper, Finance Minister Evangelos Venizelos said that 
Greece is doing whatever it can to stave off bankruptcy and abide by the
 terms of the bailout package.

He said he was confident that the disbursement of the sixth installment was certain.

'Since
 we take such difficult decisions and the Greek people make such great 
sacrifices, yes, the sixth installment is assured, Venizelos told 
newspaper, To Vima.

European
 officials are scrambling to avert a Greek debt default, which could 
wreck the balance sheets of European banks and damage the prospects of 
the euro single currency.

A
 senior member of the ruling coalition in Germany, Europe's paymaster, 
said it may be necessary for Greece to abandon the euro, a prospect 
European governments officially reject as beyond consideration.

Alexander
 Dobrindt, German politician and deputy leader of the Christian Social 
Union said: 'I believe it is a solution, if one wants to bring Greece 
back into a economically stable competitive condition, that this would 
be done outside the euro zone.'

To
 persuade its creditors to release the loans, the government has 
promised to introduce new taxes, cut state wages by an average of 20 
percent and reduce the number of public sector workers by a fifth by 
2015.   

Greeks
 hostile against the austerity measures say the harsh cuts will deepen 
the impact of a three-year recession and disproportionately hurt the 
poor and middle class.

Labour
 unions hope to step up political pressure with a campaign of strikes 
and protests in coming weeks. The government has a majority of just four
 seats in parliament and could be forced into elections if a handful of 
lawmakers balk.

 of black-shirted anarchists marched through the capital's central 
Syntagma Square on Saturday, chanting slogans and carrying black and red
 flags.

Police hope to prevent a repeat of street battles in June when more than 100 people were hurt.               

The government has yet to announce how the programme would work, including details such as whether it would be used to push out younger workers or only to accelerate the retirement of workers already reaching pension age.      

A senior Greek official said: 'We want to conclude negotiations with the troika on the labour reserve by tomorrow and also approve it in a cabinet meeting tomorrow.'

The troika inspectors want assurances that the plan will be implemented swiftly and will not only include civil servants close to retirement, the official said.
