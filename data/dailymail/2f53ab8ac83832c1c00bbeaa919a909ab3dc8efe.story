He has made a fortune out of  his ear for music - and it turns out his eye for art isn’t too bad either.

A painting bought by Eric Clapton for £2million has sold for more than £21million, the highest amount ever paid for a work by a living artist.

The guitarist, 67, bought the abstract work in 2001 and it was expected to sell for around £10million when auctioned at Sotheby’s in London.

However, fierce rivalry between two 
anonymous telephone bidders meant the picture, by German artist Gerhard 
Richter, eventually sold for £21,321,250.

The garish-looking 1994 oil painting, 
called Abstraktes Bild (808-4), was described by Sotheby’s as a 
‘masterpiece of calculated chaos’.

The sale on Friday broke the previous 
record for a work by  a living artist, which was set in 2010 when a 
painting by American Jasper Johns sold for £17.8million.

Clapton, who is worth £140million, 
studied art for a year before his career took off and has used some of 
his fortune to build an art collection.

In 1997 he sold 32 works for £420,000,
 including paintings by Henri Matisse and Edgar Degas.

He also collects 
watches, one of which, a rare platinum-cased Patek Philippe, is due to 
go under the hammer next month, valued at £2.65million.

Richter, 80, is regarded as one of the world’s greatest living painters, with work in the Tate and many private collections.
