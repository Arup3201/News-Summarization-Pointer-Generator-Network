The Old Town Hall in Sheffield, which housed the city's crown and high court until the 1990s, has lain dormant since 1996 - but its public gallery, benches and dock are still intact, giving the appearance of a building frozen in time. 

The Grade II listed building's glory has faded over the years but remnants of its role as a council chamber and court are still visible among the decaying timber and rotting carpets.

The court, in Sheffield, is littered with dust and dirt but is largely sound structurally despite being abandoned for almost 20 years

Neglected but not forgotten: The Old Town Hall, which housed the city's crown and high court until the 1990s, has lain dormant since 1996

The impressive and once imposing building still has its stone pillars, an ornate reminder of what once went on in the abandoned courthouse

The Grade II listed building's glory has faded over the years, with its wallpaper peeling and holes visible in its ceilings

Meeting benches are still scattered across the main room, despite nothing having been done with the building since it last shut its doors.

Even with the holes in the ceilings and peeling wallpaper, the aged building refuses to relinquish it's former grandeur - as can be seen in the wooden panelling, the ironwork on the stairs, the ornate fireplaces and huge doorways.

Now campaigners battling to see the building restored to its former glory have slammed the owners' 'contempt for the city' for allowing it to stand derelict.

After a meeting to discuss the building's future, the Friends Of The Old Town Hall group has now vowed to increase pressure on the owners in the coming months.

Group member Victoria Bayliss said: 'There is anger about what is happening to the shabby building. A petition has been set up and has 1,000 signatures already. The council has been very supportive of us. 

'We are going to try to put pressure on the owners of the building because they are letting this listed building go to ruin.

Most of the court's staircases are still perfectly safe to use, with each floor giving an insight into the building's past

Campaigner Victoria Bayliss said there was 'anger' about what was happening to the 'shabby' courthouse

Campaigners say they would be happy to see the building used for a different function, so long as it respected its history

'About 14 to 15 years ago there was planning permission to turn it into a nightclub. We would welcome any use for the building as long as it respected the building, we have an open mind.

'We can't leave it to moulder. It is an eyesore at the moment but has potential as the backdrop to the new Castlegate Park that will showcase the remains of the castle after the archaeological work slated to follow the demolition of the markets. Right now, it's a drag on development.'

A representative of the Old Town Hall's owners was contacted for comment but did not respond.
