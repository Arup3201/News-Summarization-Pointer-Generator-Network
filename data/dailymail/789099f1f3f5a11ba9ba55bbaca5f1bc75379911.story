Her mother fell for the Rolling Stone's front man but it's the Beatles who make Georgia May Jagger go weak at the knees in a new advert.

The model recreates Beatlemania in the latest campaign for make-up brand Rimmel.

Dressed in a monochrome mini dress, the model swoons and screams she dances to a tune played by a band resembling John, Paul, George and Ringo in their heyday.

Perfect pout: The daughter of Jerry Hall and Mick Jagger is currently in demand as a model

Sporting a beehive hairstyle and bold eyeliner, Georgia looks every inch the Sixties siren as she pouts and poses for the camera.

At the age of 21, Georgia wasn't born when the Beatles first found fame and went on to rival her father Mick Jagger's band the Rolling Stones in the charts.

Her mother, Jerry Hall, also a model, went on to win Mick's heart but it's the Fab Four who set Georgia's pulse racing in the advert.

The star is currently one of the world's most in demand models with campaigns for Hudson, Louis Vuitton and Just Cavalli perfume already under her belt this year.

The gap in her teeth, that she refused to correct with braces when she was younger, is one of her most famous traits but she told net-a-porter's The Edit magazine last month that she worries it will maker her look 'scary' when she's older.

'I still worry I'm going to look weird as I get older. I'll be a weird old woman with scary teeth,' she joked.

While she always looks flawless in advert campaigns, like the one for Rimmel, she added that she's glad her gappy teeth show young girls that you don't have to look perfect to be beautiful.

She said: 'There's this whole idea of perfection (in modeling). What younger girls don't realise is that these girls do have problems. It's good for people to realise everyone is human.'
