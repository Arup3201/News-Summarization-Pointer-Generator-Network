A British couple on holiday in Los Angeles have told how they drank, showered and brushed their teeth with water from a rooftop tank at a hotel – where a woman’s body had been decomposing for three weeks.

It was only when the bloated body of 21-year-old university student Elisa Lam was discovered this week that they found out why the hotel water tasted ‘funny’.

Sabina Baugh, 27, spent eight days with husband Michael, also 27, at the Cecil Hotel in downtown LA.

'Sick to the stomach': Michael and Sabina Baugh said the water at the hotel 'tasted funny'

The area has one of the highest crime 
rates in the city, so rather than go in search of bottled water at 
night, they drank from the tap.

Yesterday Mrs Baugh, a piano teacher, 
said: ‘The water did have a very funny, disgusting taste. We never 
thought anything of it. We thought it was just the way it was here.’

Mr Baugh, a guitarist and music 
teacher, added: ‘The moment we found out, we felt sick to the stomach, 
quite literally. We’re not well mentally. It’s the psychological stuff. 
If you think about it, it’s not good.’

The couple also said water at the 
£52-a-night hotel, given a two-star rating on review site TripAdvisor, 
had been trickling from the tap. Other guests reported flooding.

The 
couple, from Plymouth, are now staying in another part of the city and 
the authorities are testing the water in the area for contamination.

Mystery: Los Angeles fire fighters peer down at the water tanks on the roof of the Hotel Cecil as they try to figure out how to remove the body of a young woman found inside

Michael Baugh said they felt unwell 'mentally' after they heard the body of Elisa Lam was in the water tank

Police confirmed yesterday that the 
body was Elisa Lam, a student at the University of British Columbia in 
Canada, who was travelling to Santa Cruz in northern California when she
 disappeared at the start of the month to the distress of her family.

Police don’t know how Miss Lam died or
 how she ended up in the tank on the roof of the hotel, which is 
protected by locked doors and an alarm.

The
 hotel built in the 1920s but 
refurbished several years ago was the once occasional home to serial 
killers Richard Ramirez - nicknamed the Night Stalker - and Jack 
Unterweger responsible for the death of nine prostitutes in Europe and 
the U.S.

Found: Lam was found wedged in the water tank above the Cecil Hotel by a maintenance worker after guests complained of low water pressure

Police say there have been reports of continuing crime at the hotel.

Her body was discovered in one of 
four large water tanks after a maintenance worker went up to investigate
 reports of low water pressure, a Los Angeles police spokeswoman said.

Bernard Diaz, 89, who has lived at 
the Cecil for 32 years, told the LA Times that he heard a 'tremendous' 
racket on his floor above him the night Lam disappeared.

He said the floor also experience flooding that night.
