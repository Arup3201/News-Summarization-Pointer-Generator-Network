The NRL will consider a plan that would see brave Forster teen Curtis Landers deliver the ball to halfway on Grand Final day.

Landers, 14, is in intensive care at Royal North Shore hospital after a 24 May horror tackle, that fractured his c2 and c3 vertebrae, left him paralysed.

A huge groundswell of support from Landers' local community and the top echelons of Australian media has played out in the days since and thousands of dollars have been raised for the teen's future so far.

'Ideally we want to get a block of land, put a house on it, and put it in Curtis' name,' said Warren Blissett, a coach of the rising young star.

'It's the good spirit of country folk.'

The Forster Tuncurry Hawks are staging an auction on 31 July in the hope of raising tens of thousands of dollars for their embattled young star. Ray Hadley - who visited Curtis in hospital - has already signed on to host the event.

Mr Blissett said Curtis is now able to talk and his mischievous spirit is starting to return.

'He's bossing his dad around, telling him to do this, do that,' Mr Blissett joked.

'That's brought a real smile to (his father's) face. He can see improvement.'

Yesterday it was revealed that Curtis had met with NRL hero Alex McKinnon in hospital after a photo of the pair in wheelchairs was posted to the Curtis Landers: Road To Recovery Facebook page.

The Knights forward is also in Royal North Shore undergoing treatment for fractured c4 and c5 vertebrae he suffered in a devastating tackle on 24 March.

Curtis and McKinnon spent hours talking and swapping support and advice.

While the fourteen-year-old's father Kevin is 'still feeling raw emotion' and enjoying alone time with his son, Mr Blissett heaped praise on the talented rugby league player who is improving by the day.

'Now that he can communicate, it's a huge lift in his spirits,' said an emotional Mr Blissett.

'He's got quality, he's able to speak...He's so well mannered. He's one of those boys where if you had to have another son you'd be happy to have him.'

Cheeky: Since being able to talk again, Curtis has been 'bossing his dad around' and smiling for the camera

Curtis, a 'Canterbury Bulldogs nut', recently played in the Canberra Raiders country recruit camp, where he was coached by rugby league legend Ricky Stuart.

An NRL spokeswoman told MailOnline the idea to have Curtis deliver the ball to the middle of the ANZ turf has been submitted to senior events staff and One Community - the NRL's charitable and community relations branch - and that it will be considered.

She said the plan was dependent on Curtis' recovery and any grand final day commitments already in place between the NRL, corporate sponsors and other community organisations.
