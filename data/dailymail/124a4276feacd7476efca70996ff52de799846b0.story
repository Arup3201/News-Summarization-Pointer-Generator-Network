Ben Proud ended England's wait for their first gold medal in the Glasgow 2014 pool when he triumphed in the 50m butterfly final.

The Londoner was up against former Olympic and world champion Roland Schoeman but a new Commonwealth Games record time of 22.93 earned him victory.

Another South African, Chad Le Cross, had to settle for bronze as the second night of swimming action got underway at the Tollcross Swimming Centre.

Gold: Proud's time of 22.93 saw him break the Commonwealth Games record time in Glasgow

Proud burst on to the international scene last year when he blew Mark Foster's 10-year-old British 50m butterfly record out of the water.

But his Commonwealth victory was the biggest win of the 19-year-old's fledgling career as romped home in the sprint event by eight hundredths of a second.

In the women's one-length butterfly contest, Scotland's Corrie Scott continued her nation's fine start to the swimming action as she claimed bronze.

Twelfth four years ago in Dehli, the 20-year-old from Bellshill claimed a podium place with a time of 30.75 secs as Australia's Leiston Pickett beat Alia Atkinson of Jamaica to the gold.

The delighted Scott said: 'If someone had told me this time last year that I would get a bronze medal, I would have laughed in their face and said no way.

'I can't believe it. I need to watch it back. My swimming is my good bit, my dive and my finish are not so good bits, there is always stuff to work on.'
