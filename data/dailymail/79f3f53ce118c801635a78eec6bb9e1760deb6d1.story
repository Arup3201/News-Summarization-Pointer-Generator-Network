Outspoken: Singer Morrissey, who says he sees 'no difference' between eating meat and paedophilia

Smiths singer Morrissey has said he sees 'no difference' between eating animals and paedophilia.

The incredible suggestion was shared in a Q&A session on his fan site - True To You.

The site allows fans to submit questions to the singer and Morrissey is said to answer each one personally.

On the site, Matthew from Preston asked, 'Knowing that you are a loyal and proud vegetarian, I would like to ask you what is it that motivated you to stop eating meat for good?'

The answer read: 'If you have access to You Tube, you should click on to what is called The video the meat industry doesn't want you to see.

'If this doesn't affect you in a moral sense then you're probably granite.

'I see no difference between eating animals and paedophilia.

'They are both rape, violence, murder. If I'm introduced to anyone who eats beings, I walk away.

'Imagine, for example, if you were in a nightclub and someone said to you "Hello, I enjoy bloodshed, throat-slitting and the destruction of life," well, I doubt if you'd want to exchange phone numbers.'

Later, Paddy from Stockport asked: 'What achievement are you most proud of in your life?'

He replied: 'Many people have told me that they stopped eating flesh because of something I said. I can't ask higher than that, and I wouldn't aim for higher than that.

'If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz. There's no difference.

'People who would disagree with this statement have probably never been inside an abattoir.'

Controversial: Morrissey added: 'If you believe in the abattoir then you would support Auschwitz'

In another bizarre post, he wrote: 'If Jamie 'Orrible is so certain that flesh-food is tasty then why doesn't he stick one of his children in a microwave?'

And then, on the topic of Cilla Black preparing a leg of lamb on television, he added: 'Since a lamb is a baby, I wondered what kind of mind Cilla Black could possibly have that would convince her that eating a baby is OK?'

Morrissey also threatened to 'slip into permanent unconsciousness' if any journalist ever asked him again about the Smiths.

The controversial singer has long been known as an animal rights activist.

In November, he said he disapproved of the country's Thanksgiving holiday - renaming it Thankskilling.

The outspoken star recently published his autobiography - which he insisted on being published in the Penguin Classics series.
