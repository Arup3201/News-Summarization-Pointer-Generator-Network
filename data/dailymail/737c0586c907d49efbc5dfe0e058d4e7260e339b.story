A Marcos Mantis sports car is worth somewhere between £25,000 and £35,000.

It was close to the exclusive Brown Hart Gardens, which was recently reopened as a rooftop communal space in London.

The car was covered in dirt and dust as well as the paint as it was parked next to roadworks.

Marcos, a British brand, was founded in 1959 by Jem Marsh and Frank Costin.

Costin had worked on the De Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and from there moved into car design.

The name Mantis comes from the insect signifies the performance of the Mantis' engine, a supercharged 4.6 litre V8.
