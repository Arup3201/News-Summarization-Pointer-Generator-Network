This is the moment a dog who was swept out to sea was saved from certain death by a lifeboat crew.

The Golden Labrador disappeared after going for a dip while walking with its owner along the Sea Palling beach, Norfolk, on Sunday morning.

Her owner searched with two kayakers for the poor animal, but they were unable to find her - leaving the devastated owner to break the news to his wife.

To the rescue: RNLI staff managed to save this terrified animal after it was swept away off the coast of Norfolk

Approach: The female's owner was walking along Sea Palling beach when the animal disappeared. RNLI staff then began a search for the dog, finding her on these rocks after hearing barking

SOS: Happisburgh, Norfolk, RNLI spotted the animal half a mile out to sea standing on some rocks, pictured

But luckily the coastguard managed to contact the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) volunteers who were on a training exercise.

The crew from Happisburgh, Norfolk, was diverted and started a search for the missing dog.

At half a mile out to sea the volunteers were about to give up the search but then they suddenly heard barking coming from the terrified lab shaking on rocks on a reef.

These heart-warming shots shows the crew coaxing the animal across the reef and into one of the crew member's arms to carry it safety in the boat.

Lucky: The animal's owner had already searched for the dog with two kayakers before the RNLI were called

Attached: Staff aboard the boat secured the shivering animal, latching a rope onto her collar

All aboard: Staff then gently pulled the animal - who was soaked through - on to their lifeboat

They tried to keep her warm as they returned to the beach where they wrapped the dog in a blanket and took her back to their lifeboat station.

She was then reunited with her owners.

An RNLI spokesman said: 'We are sure this will make their Christmas much more enjoyable with the return of their pet.

'We believe the Labrador was a nursing mother so this rescue will make a great difference to her pups.'

Easy does it: The female is lifted to the warmth of the boat by a team member

Good girl! The animal looks a little relieved to be off the rocks and with a staff member
