Paul Walker's autopsy results revealed a horrific list of injuries that led to the star's death.

According to a coroner's report released Friday, the actor's skin burned off, he suffered from multiple broken bones and a fractured jaw after his November 30 car crash in a California suburb.

It was also revealed the driver of the Porsche Carrera GT carrying the Fast & Furious icon was going 100 mph or more.

Crash scene: The driver was going 100mph when the accident happened, according to a Friday report from Fox News

The 40-year-old could have taken a few breaths after impact as bits of soot were found in his trachea, the report states.

The cause of death - which was already stated on his Death Certificate - was from 'combined effects of traumatic and thermal injuries.'

The actor's entire body was charred through the skin it was burned so badly none of his organs were suitable for donation, according to the report.

His body was discovered in the passenger seat in a 'pugilistic stance,' which means he was in a defensive position preparing for a crash.

There were multiple fractures throughout his body, including his jaw, collarbone, and left upper arm according to the report. There were also various ribs and pelvic fractures.

Coroner's report: Also on Friday a final summation of the 'traffic collision' was released

So many details: The report gave the exact address of the crash scene and listed Paul's condition as 'charred'

Too injured: The preliminary examination report did not list all the damage done to the 40-year-old's body but did note he was wearing a T-shirt, jeans and boxer briefs

Nothing could be saved: Fire men surveying the scene

The L.A. County Coroner is keeping parts of the actor's organs. A source told TMZ the 'tissues are kept for a certain period of time in case of lawsuits.'

Driver Roger Rodas, 38, suffered major head trauma. A gruesome detail was added: The 'top portion of his skull fractured and his brain exposed.'

Alcohol and drug traces were not found in either body.

The car spun 180 degrees after impact and nearly broke in half before it exploded in Santa Clarita, which is a one hour drive from downtown Los Angeles.

Saying goodbye: Two weeks after his passing, family and friends gathered for a private funeral in LA

Paul had been at an event for his charity Reach Out Worldwide before deciding to take the cherry red car out for a drive with his friend.

The fundraiser, to benefit victims of Typhoon Haiyan, had been taking place in a race car shop near the scene of the crash.

Guests rushed to put out the flames with fire extinguishers but the fireball had already engulfed the car.

The pair were friends and had been racing for several years.

Rodas had helped Walker establish his Reach Out Worldwide charity, after creating his own foundation to support widows and orphans in his native El Salvador. He was also the CEO of Always Evolving, the car customization shop where the charity event had been taking place.

The star's representative confirmed his death in an email: 'Sadly, I must confirm that Paul did pass away this afternoon in a car accident.'

The actor's official Facebook page said: 'It is with a truly heavy heart that we must confirm that Paul Walker passed away today in a tragic car accident while attending a charity event for his organisation Reach Out Worldwide. 'He was a passenger in a friend's car, in which both lost their lives.

Two weeks after Paul's death, a private and small funeral was held for family and friends.

Paul had been shooting The Fast & Furious 7 when the crash happened.

It was reported on Friday by The Hollywood Reporter that his character would retire and not be killed off. Additional scenes may have to be shot.

The movie is set to open April 10, 2015.

The end: Paul's character will retire in the seventh installment of the film; here he is in the sixth F&F with Jordana
