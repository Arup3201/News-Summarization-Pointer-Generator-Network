Hackers behind the massive Sony breach flashed a disturbing message on the company's computers on Thursday, according to reports.

The group purporting to be the Guardians of Peace or #GOP, who have claimed responsibility for the attack, sent the message to 'several' computer screens at the studio, a source told The Wrap. 

The insider, who did not reveal the specifics of the warning, said it left recipients feeling 'disturbed'.

Sony Pictures has not yet responded to MailOnline's request for comment. 

The message - the fourth by the group - comes just weeks after the GOP apparently sent a similarly threatening message to staffer's computer screens in late November.

Threat: The Guardians of Peace reportedly sent another threat to Sony computers on Thursday. Pictured is a screen grab showing a waning that the group allegedly sent to company computers in November

That message featured an image of a demonic skeleton and the words: 'Warning: We've already warned you, and this is just a beginning. We continue till our request be met. We've obtained all your internal data including your secrets and top secret.'

Then on December 5, the group sent an email threatening the well-being of workers and their families, the Wrap reported.  

'Removing Sony Pictures on earth is a very tiny work for our group which is a worldwide organization. And what we have done so far is only a small part of our further plan,' it said. 

The group has demanded that the studio stop its release of 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogan and which lampoons North Korea.

So far the hacked information has been humiliating for Sony Pictures Entertainment. The corporation are understood to have known about the leak since February but chose to keep it quiet, according to Gawker.

In one leaked email, it emerged that co-chairman Amy Pascal calls Angelina Jolie a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' during a heated email conversation with Hollywood producer Scott Rudin.

Pascal has since issued an apology saying: 'The content of my emails were insensitive and inappropriate but are not an accurate reflection of who I am.'

Not impressed: Angelina Jolie glares at Pascal at an event in Los Angeles on Wednesday after it emerged Pascal had called the actress a 'minimally talented spoiled brat' in an email exchange

She added: 'Although this was a private communication that was stolen, I accept full responsibility for what I wrote and apologize to everyone who was offended.'

Other emails show they exchanged racially insenstive comments about President Obama.

On the eve of a fundraising breakfast being attended by the President at the home of DreamWorks CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg, Pascal and Rudin went over things she could discuss with Obama while at the event in October 2013.

'Should I ask him if he liked DJANGO?' Pascal asks Rudin, a reference to the 2012 Quentin Tarantino film Django Unchained that dealt with the subject of slavery.

'12 years,' responds Rudin, referencing another slavery film, this time Steve McQueen's 2013 Academy Award-winning work 12 Years a Slave.

Rudin has also apologized for the comments.

'I made a series of remarks that were meant only to be funny, but in the cold light of day, they are in fact thoughtless and insensitive - and not funny at all,' he said. 'To anybody I've offended, I'm profoundly and deeply sorry, and I regret and apologize for any injury they might have caused.'

In another email exchange, Sony exec Clint Culpepper, pictured left, called actor Kevin Hart a 'whore' for asking to be compensated for promoting a movie on social media. They are pictured with Pascal

Actor Kevin Hart was another celebrity mocked in leaked emails from Sony executives.

In an email exchange released on Wednesday, Sony executive Clint Culpepper called him a 'whore' after members of his team asked that he be compensated for promoting one of his upcoming films on social media.

Hart responded to the remarks on his Instagram account, saying: 'Knowing your self worth is extremely important people. I worked very hard to get where I am today. I look at myself as a brand and because of that I will never allow myself to be taking advantage of.

'I OWN MY BRAND…I MAKE SMART DECISIONS FOR MY BRAND….I PROTECT MY BRAND….which is why I’m able to brush ignorance off of my shoulder and continue to move forward.' 

Sony's cyber-security nightmare deepened last night after it was revealed hackers also stole medical information of dozens of it employees and their children and posted it online.
