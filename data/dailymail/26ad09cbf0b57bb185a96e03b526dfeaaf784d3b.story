Freddy, Sina, Finn, Morta Boy, Tinkerbell, Silly Billy, Annie, Gregory, Mama, Barbie, Kim, Pappa, Don, Derrik, Tess and Long Grass, who's always outside – these are just a handful of Gloria Morales' 30-odd dogs. 

The Chilean-born migrant who moved to the remote Aboriginal community of Yuendumu in Central Australia 10 years ago, is one of the 85 women that feature in photographer David Darcy's new book, A Girl's Best Friend.

The 42-year-old photographer from the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, whose favourite sight is the face of dog hanging out of a car window, told Daily Mail Australia that he spent half a year travelling around the country to document the stories and happy moments between women and their dogs for his new book.

Gloria Morales currently lives with about 32 dogs in her outback home in the remote Aboriginal community of Yuendumu in Central Australia

The Chilean-born migrant has dedicated her life to saving the seven hundred or so stray dogs in the area by implementing health programs and educating locals on how best to deal with the problem while maintaining respect for the animals

'There are about 85 women in the book from all walks of life - some of them are living on the streets, some of them are millionaires and celebrities as well,' he said.

Amongst them is Christine, from Alice Springs, who adopted her dog Bill after finding him  abandoned and stranded in the flood waters following Hurricane Katrina in the United States.

'He was using this car as like an island, but because of the heat at the time, all his feet had become blistered from the roof and Christine found him over there and brought him all the way back to Australia,' Mr Darcy said.

Meanwhile Linda, who lives in Penrith with her beagle, Sam, spent over $50,000 to save her dog's life from numerous health conditions including lymphoma and epilepsy.

But it's Gloria, with her Land Cruiser over-flowing with canines, that has dedicated her whole life to saving the seven hundred or so stray dogs in her local community.

She has dedicated her time to implementing health programs and educating locals on how best to deal with the strays, while maintaining respect for the animals.

'Ten years ago I arrived here in Yuendumu to work as the assistant art manager, and I discovered that the dogs in the community were in really bad condition. There was no vet coming here, no animal welfare people,' Gloria told Darcey.

'Most people in the community didn't realise that if you had a sick dog, you could do something about it—like if you take medication for yourself you're going to get better. If you do it for the dogs, they are going to get better also.'

Camille adopted Bella when she was still a veterinary student. 'Bella's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that Camille can't fix; she's learnt all the skills in the world but she can’t save this dog from her heart condition,' Mr Darcy said

Gloria began by feeding the dogs with her own money and eventually, after holding talks with the local council, managed to arrange for a vet to come out to the remote town to help manage simple health problems like ticks, start a temporary sterilisation solution and offer the option of euthanasia.

'Many of the dogs were unwanted, but it was very difficult for the people to say that because the police would come round and shoot the unwanted dogs,' Gloria said.

'The locals didn't want to see the dogs shot, so the vet showed them how she could put them to sleep in a very comfortable manner, without any screaming, fighting or bloodshed.

'When the community saw this option they surrendered 174 dogs for euthanasia. It was very sad, but it was also amazing because these people were being educated and were able to manage an animal health problem for the first time.'

Gloria was also responsible for the adoption of over 250 dogs that were sent out to various new homes across the country through the Desert Dogs program.

'When I arrived here, people told me that these Aboriginals don't care about the dogs. That was bulls***!' Gloria said. 

She recalled unforgettable moments of compassion from the locals, including one family who waited until their dog was under anaesthetic and unable to hear them during its sterilisation, before admitting they didn't want to keep him.

Hannah met Axel after moving from Sydney’s northern beaches to Alice Springs, where she turned her life around by beginning work on a camel farm and forming a relationship with a camel stockman

'That showed me that they really did respect the dogs, because they didn't want the dog to know it wasn't wanted,' Gloria said.

She also remembered an Aboriginal family that had dug a specific grave for their dog, which had passed away, so that his head would be pointing towards his home, and held hands to pray following his burial.

But it's her own dog family that makes Gloria love her life.

'Over the ten years I've been here, I've probably had more than 1000 dogs living here. At the moment I have 32 dogs. They are all different and they all have their quirky behaviours.'

David Darcy and his own loved pets: A Girl's Best Friend is the photographer’s fifth book entirely dedicated to dogs

'People always ask if I have a favourite, but I love them all. Some people might look at me and think I'm crazy, because the situation might look overwhelming…, but the other day I was thinking just how lucky I am to have all these dogs. I really love my life.'

One of the most memorable characters Mr Darcy met on his travels, was Camille and her dog Bella. The duo met while Camille was a vet student, practising operations on dogs that had to be euthanised.

But the bond between Camille and Bella became too strong, and the student felt compelled to save her life and adopt her.

Years later, with the growth of her own veterinary business, Camille is coming to terms with letting Bella go.

'She's been diagnosed with a terminal illness that Camille can't fix; she's learnt all the skills in the world, but she can't save this dog from her heart condition,' Mr Darcy said of the heart-wrenching duo.

'For me it's about those little moments – I see a lot of photos of dogs that are staged, but if you are a dog lover, you know and understand them and that little moment of interaction, when the dog is doing something beautiful and you get joy from it, that gives me a great happiness.

A Girl's Best Friend by David Darcy (Murdoch Books) $29.99, is available now.
