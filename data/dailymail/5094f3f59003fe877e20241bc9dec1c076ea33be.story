Ada Ng, 28, posted this selfie from the cockpit of the Cathay Pacific flight from Taipei to Hong Kong

A 28-year-old Chinese woman has set tongues wagging online after bragging of being allowed up into the cockpit of a flight.

Ada Ng was able to take a video of the flight landing in Hong Kong from just behind the captain after he invited her to join him at the front of the plane.

The Cathay Pacific flight was reportedly full and he wasted no time inviting the young lady into the cockpit for her return journey from Taipei to Hong Kong. 

According to shanghaiist.com, she posted several pictures to her page on the Chinese social networking site Weibo, gushing about how much she had enjoyed the experience of takeoff and landing.

Responding to the posts,  some Weibo users expressed fears about security because most airlines have made it virtually impossible for passengers to access the cockpit post-9/11.

The photos continued to circulate online despite Ms Ng subsequently removing them from her profile. 

Ms Ng was meant to be sitting in a jump seat in business class, according to an image of her ticket which she put up online.

Such seats are sometimes used by trainee pilots or off-duty crew members travelling between airports or by cabin crew during takeoff and landing and they can also be offered to the family of crew members.

It is unclear whether Ms Ng fell into that category.   

A pilot and a flight attendant were dismissed from Cathay Pacific in 2011 after photos emerged of them indulging in oral sex in the cockpit.
