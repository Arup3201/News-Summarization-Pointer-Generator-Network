A private company is raking in cash by fining more than 100 people a day for dropping litter, according to a report.

Members of the public are being treated as ‘cash cows’ by over-zealous litter patrols who work for a firm that has signed lucrative commission-only contracts with councils, say critics.

At least 12 local authorities have employed one business, Xfor, to issue on-the-spot fines. It keeps at least £35 from each £75 penalty notice its staff hand out.

Littering: A private company is making money out of fining more than 100 people a day for dropping litter

So far, the firm has issued 43,478 fines under the payment-for-penalties deal – equivalent to 750 a week, according to a report.

Freedom of Information requests show that the company, run by ex-Armed Forces personnel, has pocketed £1.6million of the money it has raised from tickets handed out by 51 members of staff.

Critics have accused the councils and the firm of ‘profiteering’ by ruthlessly pursuing anyone suspected of dropping rubbish.

One woman in Blaenau Gwent, South Wales, was fined by Xfor for dropping a thread from her glove accidentally. Another was fined for walking her dog in a field she had used for 30 years, unaware it had been turned into a no-dog zone.

In Hillingdon, West London, people have been fined for dropping nut shells or orange peel, which rots away.

The details are contained in a report 
which shows that across the country, town hall enforcement officers and 
councils that hire private companies issued a total of 73,536 penalties 
last year, equivalent to 200 a day. Of that total, 63,883 were issued in
England – up from 727 in 1997.

The
huge rise comes after the introduction of the Neighbourhoods and 
Environment Act 2005, which allowed local authorities to retain funds 
raised by fines.

Community Secretary Eric Pickles said councils should not use residents as cash cows

The report, published by the Manifesto Club think-tank, estimates that councils raked in £5.5million last year. Entitled The Corruption Of Punishment: How Litter Fines Became A Business, it shows that the largest number of litter fines handed out in one area last year was in Newham, East London, which earned the council £664,875.

Josie Appleton, of the libertarian group, said: ‘It is a booming business. The fines are not being issued in the public interest, but as a money-making operation for cash-strapped public authorities and their growing army of contractors.

‘People are being fined not for the most serious offences but for the most trivial, which are easy to catch. Several members of the public have been fined for dropping things by accident, or which they were in the process of picking up.

‘Many councils are spending more time investigating and prosecuting people for cigarette butts than for fly-tipping.’

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The exponential rise in spot fines for petty offences, and the payment of commission to litter police, means more jobsworth officials and increasing numbers of decent citizens being treated like a revenue cash cow.’

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles said: ‘Those who shamelessly litter and fly-tip should be brought to book. But councils shouldn’t be using residents as cash cows.’

Xfor did not respond to requests for comment last night.
