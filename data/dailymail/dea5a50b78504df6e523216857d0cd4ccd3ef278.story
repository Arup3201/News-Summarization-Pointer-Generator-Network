Never again can Moeen Ali be considered a part-time spinner, not now that ‘the beard’ will be well and truly feared after the perfect end to the complete Test for England and captain Alastair Cook.

What a turnaround from the embarrassing last day at Lord’s. What a  performance from a man who found himself in the eye of a storm over his views on Gaza before creating a storm that engulfed India’s batsmen.

Moeen may be different to the stereotypical English sportsman but what is absolutely clear, after he took the last four of the six wickets to fall at The Ageas Bowl on Thursday in 22 balls, is that he is the rightful successor to Graeme Swann.

It says everything about the scale of
 Moeen’s achievement in taking six for 67 as India plummeted to a 
266-run defeat that he has now claimed more wickets in three Tests than 
Swann managed in four against India in 2011.

We
 should not get carried away just yet, not after a display in which 
India batted as badly in Southampton as England did at Lord’s, but Moeen
 is clearly better than Cook and coach Peter Moores gave him credit for.

The
 sight of Simon Kerrigan in the second Test squad was evidence that 
England were still not convinced about Moeen’s bowling but Cook’s 
declaration that he had ‘never seen a bowler improve so 
quickly’ showed that this proud  Englishman and proud Muslim will be 
underestimated no longer.

While
 England were expected to wrap up a priceless third Test victory, they could never have imagined it would be all over 10  
minutes before lunch, with Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad both  giving 
Cook a celebratory hug.

It
 was Anderson, back to his absolute best with the ball swinging 
throughout in Southampton, who settled any English nerves by striking 
with his third ball of the morning and setting the tone with a spell of 
two for 11 in six overs.

Then
 it was over to Moeen, who is learning his art under the spin master 
Saeed Ajmal at  Worcestershire and who just needs more bowling now to 
develop his  variations and the ‘doosra’ that has rarely been spotted in
 this series.

The
 fact that India’s tail has been so strong in this series means that 
none of Moeen’s victims should be under-valued, with the possible 
exception of hapless debutant Pankaj Singh, who looks a glorious 
throwback to the days of true No11s.

Three
 of Moeen’s four wickets  were clean bowled, with the other 
coming when Bhuvneshwar Kumar edged to gully just after Cook had placed 
Anderson there for that very dismissal.

It
 was that sort of Test for Cook, who has come through the most searching
 examination of his character here, with as many as seven former England
 captains calling for his head after the team’s winless run had 
stretched to 10 games.

Cook
 has not exactly turned into Mike Brearley overnight but it was always 
likely that his decision- making would become better once he had scored 
runs to unclutter his mind and once his team had started performing to 
their potential.

One
 swallow does not make a summer and England will need to back this 
display up with another good one at Old Trafford, starting next 
Thursday, but their first Test win for fully 353 days will ease the 
pressure on a new team still finding its feet.

The
 giant cloud still hanging over England is today’s disciplinary hearing 
against Anderson and there is no question that his absence would leave a
 mighty hole in the attack if he is suspended by judicial commissioner 
Gordon Lewis.

India’s
 determination to see Anderson, who has irked them with his sledging, 
banished from the rest of the series is very strong while England are 
adamant that his brush with Ravindra Jadeja has created a fuss over 
nothing.

As
 India usually get their way in world cricket — as  evidenced by them 
being allowed to appeal Jadeja’s fine when no appeal process is 
permitted for Level One offences — England might have to prepare for the
 worst in Manchester.

Neither
 Chris Jordan nor Chris Woakes took a wicket in this match and Liam 
Plunkett will surely return on an Old Trafford pitch that is expected to
 be the quickest and bounciest of this Investec series.

Both
 Cook and Anderson were quick to point out that Woakes bowled well 
without luck but  Jordan had a shocker and it will be interesting to see
 whether England keep faith with him at a ground where he thrived in a 
one-day international against Sri Lanka earlier this season.

For now that dilemma can wait, with 
Moeen — who now has 15 wickets in this series — Gary Ballance, Sam 
Robson,  Jordan and Jos Buttler, who was superb with both bat and gloves
 on  debut, all celebrating their first win in Test cricket.

It
 says everything about England’s performance that Cook, Moeen,  
Ballance, Buttler and Ian Bell could have been man of the match ahead of
 Anderson, who was back to his best for the first time since propelling 
England to victory in the first Ashes Test at Trent Bridge last year.

He
 now has 371 victims, 13 wickets away from overtaking Sir Ian Botham and
 becoming the leading wicket-taker in England’s Test history.

What
 an age ago that Trent Bridge triumph, and subsequent Ashes wins at 
Lord’s and Durham, seems. How spectacular and unexpected has been 
England’s decline since. But they have stopped the rot and, suddenly, 
everything appears to have clicked into place for the new regime. The 
test for them now will be maintaining it.
