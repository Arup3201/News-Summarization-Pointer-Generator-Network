Embattled Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez has been
banned for the entire 2014 season.

Arbitrator Fredric Horowitz handed down the 162-game
suspension Saturday in a historic decision that A-Rod announced shortly after
he intended to fight in federal court. It includes the postseason, should the
Yankees qualify.

The season-long ban is a reduction from the 211-game
suspension initially imposed by Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig,
but is a win for the league since it was clear from the beginning it wanted him gone for all of 2014.

The arbitrator’s decision is another chapter in what has
been a dramatic five months for the steroid-tainted slugger that saw him spend
the majority of the season rehabbing from injury only to be hit with the
historic suspension.

He was one of a dozen players suspended as part of the
Biogenesis investigation. All but one of the other players suspended received
50-game bans, Milwaukee Brewers left fielder received a 65-game suspension that
he accepted.

They all accepted their bans, but he immediately appealed.

The next week saw a series of terse press conferences as the
game’s highest paid player grinded through a rehab assignment at AA Trenton and
followed each game with three-ring-circus press conferences accusing the
Yankees of trying to keep him off the field.

Unprecedented: A-Rod ban is the longest PED-related suspension in baseball history

The one-time World Series champion made it on to the field
for the final month of the season and vowed to take his fight against the
suspension as far as he had to get it overturned.

‘The number of games sadly comes as no surprise, as the deck
has been stacked against me from day one,’ he said in a statement. ‘This is one
man's decision, that was not put before a fair and impartial jury, does not
involve me having failed a single drug test.’

The 14-time all-star and his legal team said the suspension
‘is at odds with the facts and is inconsistent with the terms of the Joint Drug
Agreement and the Basic Agreement.’

‘[It] relies on testimony and documents that would never
have been allowed in any court in the United States because they are false and
wholly unreliable,’ the statement continued.

Another long road back: The fading slugger spent almost the entire 2013 season rehabbing his injured hip, he will now not be allow back on a baseball field for one full year

‘I have been clear that I did not use performance enhancing
substances as alleged in the notice of discipline, or violate the Basic
Agreement or the Joint Drug Agreement in any manner, and in order to prove it I
will take this fight to federal court.’

Mr Rodriguez has long argued that accusations stemming from
the Biogenesis performance enhancing drug investigation lacks credibility, and
that evidence against him was obtained illegally.

He even famously once walked out of an arbitration hearing
late last year in protest over Mr Selig not being forced to testify – he said
he was being treated unfairly.

The player’s union stood by the player in a statement of
their own.

‘The MLBPA strongly disagrees with the award issued today in
the grievance of Alex Rodriguez, even despite the arbitration panel's decision
to reduce the duration of Mr. Rodriguez's unprecedented 211-game suspension.’

The ballplayer’s legal team tried to argue that Biogenesis founder
Anthony Bosch was a consultant, but MLB reportedly produced mountains of
evidence to the contrary, and was able to portray a close relationship between
the two men.

Mr Bosch also testified to the contrary during the arbitration hearing.

Evidence linking Mr Bosch to Major Leaguers was first
published last January in the Miami New Times, a spokesperson for Mr Rodiguez
denied at the time he had any ties to the clinic.

Naming A-Rod and a host other ballplayers to investigate,
and once investigators dug the paper trail led to the man whose 654 career home
runs rank fifth all-time.

The three-time MVP stands to lose at least $25million for
missing the 2014 season, per the widely reported terms of his record-setting
contract. He was also set to earn a $6million bonus if he hit a mere six home
runs during the season to tie Willie Mays with 660 all-time.

Mr Rodriguez will still earn a $3million bonus Jan 15
despite the suspension since he agreed to defer his signing bonus.

The 38-year-old is signed through the end of the 2017
season, and the team still owes him at least $84million through those seasons.

Since he will be almost 40 by the time he is allowed back on the
field, he may have already played his final games.
