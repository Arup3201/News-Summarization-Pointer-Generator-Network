When
 my mobile rang at around 1am on a Sunday, I knew instinctively that 
something was wrong. It was my sister, Jane, and the anguish in her 
voice confirmed my fears.

Her husband, David, had been rushed into 
hospital after developing severe chest pains. The outlook was not good 
and, unable to contact either of her daughters, Louise and Charlotte, 
who lived nearby with their partners, she pleaded with me to get hold of
 them.

In the hours that followed, Charlotte made it to Stafford 
Hospital to be with her father. Then the decision was made to transfer 
David to the specialist vascular unit at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in
 Birmingham.

David's sister Jane's husband, David, 57, died following an abdominal aortic aneurysm

During the 30-mile journey his condition deteriorated 
further and paramedics battled to keep him alive. David's eldest 
daughter Louise managed to see him before he was rushed into theatre. 

We waited in the family room clinging to the hope that he would pull through, but it was not to be.

I
 will never forget the outpouring of grief as the surgeon returned to 
tell us that David had died, just over five hours after first being 
admitted to hospital.

He was 57 and the cause of death was a rupture of the aorta - the large artery that passes from the heart to the abdomen.

It
 had burst because of an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) - where a weak 
part of the artery starts to swell, causing it to bulge outwards like a 
balloon.

Eventually, the wall bursts open causing massive internal 
bleeding which cannot be stemmed without immediate surgery. This can 
lead to the heart being starved of oxygen, which can be fatal.

Since 
his death on November 12, 2006, my family has struggled to come to terms
 with why David died so suddenly. He enjoyed good health and there were 
no signs that his life might end so abruptly. For my sister and her daughters, the loss of a wonderful husband and father has been devastating. He
 did at least live to see the arrival of his first grandchild - and he 
would have been overjoyed to see the arrival of four more.

'It is said that of patients with a ruptured AAA, half will die before they reach hospital'

On birthdays, anniversaries and at Christmas there is still a feeling that someone is missing.

There
 is also the inevitable question as to whether or not he might still 
have been here if his condition had been diagnosed sooner. 

An 
abdominal aortic aneurysm can grow slowly over years. The aorta of a 
healthy person is as wide and as tough as a garden hose, so someone can 
live with a small aneurysm for years if it does not grow much.

And 
as Dr Mike Knapton, the British Heart Foundation's associate medical 
director, explains: 'It usually causes no symptoms until it ruptures, 
which is a medical emergency, and often proves fatal.'

AAAs are responsible for nearly 6,000 deaths in England and Wales every year - with men over 65 being more at risk than women.

The exact reason for this is not clear, but genetic factors are important and female hormones are thought to offer protection.

Because of hereditary influences anyone whose brother, sister or parent has had the condition could also be at risk.

Aneurysms
 may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries, due to things such
 as smoking, an unhealthy diet, and high blood pressure. AAA has an 
extremely high mortality rate, says Dr Jenny Richards, a clinical 
lecturer in vascular surgery from the Centre of Research Excellence at 
the University of Edinburgh.

'It is said that of patients with a 
ruptured AAA, half will die before they reach hospital. And half of 
those who do reach hospital will die before they reach the operating 
theatre and then half of those who have an operation to repair the tear 
in the artery will not survive.'

In March 2009, NHS England set up 
the National AAA Screening Programme for all men reaching 65, with 
identical programmes rolled out in stages across the rest of Britain 
from 2012. Men over 65, who have not previously been screened, can put 
themselves forward for the programme, too.

Uptake for the screening 
has been good - 76 per cent of the 226,901 men aged 65 invited for 
screening attended their appointments. A further 13,164 men above 65 
referred themselves for screening.

But with more than 2,627,000 men 
aged 65 to 74 in the UK, according to the latest census, clearly more 
lives could be saved if those who do not qualify for screening 
self-referred.

The screening test consists of a ten-minute ultrasound
 scan. At less than 3cm there is no concern, but an aneurysm measuring 3
 to 4.4cm needs annual surveillance. This increases to three-monthly 
surveillance for measurements of 4.5 to 5.5cm.

Anyone with an 
aneurysm larger than 5.5cm is referred to the consultant vascular 
surgeon. Anyone found to be at risk, that is with an aneurysm greater 
than 5.5cm in diameter, can then elect for surgical intervention.

This
 involves replacing the affected part of aorta with a piece of synthetic
 tubing known as a graft - either via open surgery on the abdomen or fed
 up from the groin.

As Dr Knapton says: 'It is better to manage 
things in a proactive way than to wait for a crisis.

Assuming a patient 
survives the ruptured aorta, you then have the awful pressure it puts on
 services in terms of the emergency trip to A&E before going into 
the 'resus' room to try to repair the thing, all of which is extremely 
traumatic for patients, relatives and staff.'

One man who can't speak highly enough of the process is Colin McEwan, from Edinburgh, who had the ultrasound scan.

'The
 machine beeped and as the measurements were taken the nurse's 
expression changed. She said: “I'm afraid you have an aneurysm and it's 
quite big - around 4.9cm.” Within days I had an appointment with a 
consultant vascular surgeon at the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary.'

Aneurysms may be exacerbated by the hardening of the arteries, due to things such as smoking or bad diet

Told 
later that the aneurysm was 5.9cm and not 4.9cm he was given a choice of
 treatment - endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR), which involves a 
synthetic graft being fed up through the arteries in the legs to repair 
the aorta or open surgery, which, unlike EVAR, is a one-off procedure 
without further checks.

He opted for the latter, despite a slightly 
higher mortality risk of 1 to 5 per cent. Before his surgery, Colin 
agreed to take part in a trial of another, possibly more accurate 
screening method for AAA. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scanner, funded by the British Heart Foundation and the Medical Research
 Council, is being put to use in a study of 350 patients at Edinburgh 
Royal Infirmary.

This provides instant, real-time moving images of 
the inside of the body. It is being explored as a way to predict the 
risk of rupture and help surgeons decide which patients would benefit 
from preventative surgery, and possibly lead to even earlier 
intervention.

The proportion of men screened who will be found to have an aneurysm

Colin had the MRI scan before his initial assessment 
day and another on the day of assessment. He will have a follow up in 
two years to check for any changes. 

'MRI scanning is potentially 
more accurate but more difficult to do because it is an expensive piece 
of kit,' says Dr Knapton. 'Currently AAA screening can be done in any 
surgery setting without specialist equipment, so the challenge for the 
NHS would be a trade-off between something that is quick, easy and cheap
 and something that's less accessible.'

Six days after his operation,
 Colin McEwan was allowed home. 'For the first couple of weeks I spent a
 lot of time in bed feeling exhausted but I gradually got back to 
fitness through walking - starting slowly and increasing the distance 
each day. It has now been four months and I have started to play golf 
again and feel fine.'

It is too late for David - and at 57 he was 
too young to have been offered screening - but if advances in screening 
techniques can lead to more outcomes such as Colin's, costs will, 
hopefully, become a secondary consideration.
