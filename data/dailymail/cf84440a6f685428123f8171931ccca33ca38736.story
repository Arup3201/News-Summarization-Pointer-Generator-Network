A father who suffers from ‘Tourettes and ADHD’ has admitted killing his two-month-old baby daughter ‘after losing control’.

Tyler Vallance, 21, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his daughter Isabella at Worcester Crown Court today after a charge of murder was put to him.

He also entered a guilty plea to section 20 wounding, after the prosecution brought a charge of inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent.

Isabella was allegedly injured at an address in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire between October 5 and December 8.

She was taken to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch before being transferred to Birmingham Children's Hospital where she died five days later.

Christopher Hotton QC prosecuting said: ‘We are all of the view that we accept those pleas.’

He said the prosecution’s view was that, although there were two charges, it was ‘overwhelmingly likely that each occurred over a short period of time in a momentary loss of control by somebody with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and Tourettes.’

Vallance, formerly of Redditch, Worcestershire, will be sentenced at a later date.

Jessica Wiggins, 19, is to be tried for an alleged offence of child cruelty between October 5 and December 8, 2012 and causing or allowing the death of her daughter Isabella. She denies all of the charges

Separately, the baby’s mother, Jessica Wiggins, is to be tried for an alleged offence of child cruelty between October 5 and December 8, 2012 and causing or allowing the death of Isabella.

The 19-year-old, formerly of Bromsgrove, who denies the charges, appeared briefly in the dock today wearing a black blazer and white blouse.

Her trial will now start on Tuesday, June 24 and is expected to last 10 days.
