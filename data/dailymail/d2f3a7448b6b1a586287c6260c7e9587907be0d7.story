A judge has said he wants a white man he convicted in 1999 of killing a black man to be freed because he found him guilty due to his own reverse racism.

Frank Barbaro, a retired Brooklyn Supreme Court judge, said he convicted Donald Kagan, now 39, of shooting Wavell Wint, 22, because he saw the man as 'a bigot'.

He said that he had denied Kagan a fair trial because of his own civil rights activist opinions.

'Mistake': Retired Brooklyn Supreme Court Judge Frank Barbaro, pictured, said a white man he convicted of murdering a black man in 1999 should be freed because he was biased by his civil rights activist views

'Mr. Kagan had no intent to kill that 
man,' Barbaro, 86, told Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice ShawnDya Simpson in court, the New York Post reported.

'I believe now that I was seeing this young white fellow as a 
bigot, as someone who assassinated an African-American.'

He said his work during the civil-rights movement caused his bias in the case.

Convicted: Donald Kagan, now 39, was convicted of second-degree murder in 1999

'The question of discrimination against African-American people became part of my fiber - my very fiber,' he said in court.

Barbaro, who also served 23 years in the state Assembly, said that because of his views he didn't consider a justification defense by Kagan in the trial, which had no jury.

But ever since, he has been able to 
stop thinking about it and when he read about people who were mistakenly
 sent to jail and later exonerated, he would think of Kagan, he said.

'I
 was prejudiced during the trial,' he admitted to the court.

'I realized
 I made a terrible mistake and there was a man in jail because of my 
mistake.'

Barbaro contacted
 defense attorney Jeff Adler, who filed a motion in 2011 to overturn 
Kagan’s conviction, the Post reported, and the case will now be 
revisited.

The Supreme Court Justice will either present an acquittal, a retrial or a plea deal for time served.

Kagan
 was convicted of shooting Wint after they struggled over Kagan's chain 
outside a movie theater in New York in 1998.

Wint left behind a 
four-year-old child, Wavell Wint, Jr.

He was convicted of second-degree murder and criminal possession of a weapon.

'I shouldn’t be back here reliving the past. I thought everything was over with,' Wint told the Post.
