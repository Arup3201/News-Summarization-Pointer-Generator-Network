Messing around with spears and swords; riding a giraffe on a merry-go-round; and looking terribly refined while posing for class photographs - these images provide a glimpse of life at a privileged girls' school from the 1930s to 50s.

The historic footage of Howell's Girls' School in Denbigh, north Wales has now been given to the nation for safe keeping.

Giving a fascinating insight into a lost world, the fragile film was presented to the National Library of Wales.

The film reveals the wide range of activities the girls got up to inside the school - including weaving and basketry during the 1930s and 40s

The archive spans the years from 1933 to 1952 and takes in the Depression, World War II and the accession of Queen Elizabeth II.

Former pupil Isoline Greenhalgh started at the private school when she was 10 years old in 1943.

She said: 'I am interested in history and I think it will seem very strange to people that the sexes used to be so separate.

'All girls with all-female teaching staff - it's interesting for people to see what it was like.

The films were shot on 16mm film mainly by former teacher Miss Elizabeth Henley, who died three years ago aged 97, and fellow teacher Miss Nancy Hughes

'Games and sport took up half the afternoon. I think it's a feature of boarding schools that they have to fill up the day.

'But some of us would try to get out of games.'

The films were shot on 16mm film mainly by former teacher Miss Elizabeth Henley, who died three years ago aged 97, and fellow teacher Miss Nancy Hughes.

Much of it shows the girls taking part in sports activities such as group gymnastics and swimming, and diving in the outdoor pool.

They also reveal the wide range of activities the girls got up to inside the school - including weaving and basketry, theatre and ballet performances, and the school's speech day.
