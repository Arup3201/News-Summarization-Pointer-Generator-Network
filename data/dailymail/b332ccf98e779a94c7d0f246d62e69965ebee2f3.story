Booby-trapped Soviet weapon caches which date back to the Cold War are probably still buried across Britain, a top historian has claimed.

Professor Christopher Andrew, an expert on the history of the intelligence services, made the claim after a secret archive released today revealed the location of several arms dumps across Europe.

Soviet spies dug the stores under trees and farmland near major cities, and filled them with small arms and communications devices in case undercover agents needed to defend themselves.

Their existence is detailed in the Mitrokhin Archive, a collection of thousands of Soviet intelligence documents compiled by a defector and made public for the first time today.

Disillusioned KGB Major Vasili Mitrokhin amassed the collection over more than a decade before walking into the British embassy in Latvia in 1992 shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Those who saw him said he looked like a 
homeless man and he had buried the files, described as one of the 
greatest hauls in British history, under dirty underwear in his 
suitcase.

In the notes stored at Cambridge's Churchill Archives Centre, Mitrokhin - who died in 2004 - described the locations in incredible detail along with booby traps.

Describing a stash near Berne, Switzerland, he wrote directions to a chapel near a farm and added: 'After taking 36 steps, you will be at the point between two large leafy trees, the only ones in the sector.

'The distance between the trees is three paces... The area between the trees has been used for the cache.'

A map included in the archive pinpointed three sites, named Kollo, Fosso and Bor, around Rome.

And another note provided instructions on how to disarm an explosive booby trap called Molniya or Lightning.

It
 read: 'When digging out the container from the earth, take care not to
 strike the handle by chance.

'The handle must only be turned and the 
container tilted and taken out of the hole after the explosive device 
has been disarmed.'

Some of the caches have since been uncovered, but many are likely to remain today, said Prof Andrew, a friend of Mitrokhin who has written two books about his vast trove of documents.

Although the archive does not detail caches on British soil, Professor Andrew insisted they must exist.

'This was a large scale operation and the caches were strategically placed in most Nato countries during the Cold War,' he said.

'Given that Britain was second only to the United States in terms of importance to the Soviets at this time, it would be remarkable if this tactic wasn't deployed here.'

However, those hoping to lay their hands on a dangerous piece of history would be disappointed, Prof Andrew said.

He explained: 'Of course by now they would not be easy to find and it is unlikely the weapons would be serviceable.'
