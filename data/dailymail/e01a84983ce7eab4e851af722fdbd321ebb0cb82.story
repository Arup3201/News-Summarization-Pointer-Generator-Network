'You watch and just wonder if he was born to play football,' declared Everton boss Roberto Martinez after his star midfielder Ross Barkley graced the Goodison Park turf for the first time this season following a speedy recovery from the knee ligament injury he suffered in August.

To the surprise of most Toffees fans, Barkley was hurled into Martinez's starting line-up as he drove his side to a 3-0 victory against Aston Villa on Saturday, picking up an assist and a standing ovation along the way.

Now, with Lille looming, Barkley will get the chance to make his European bow as Everton prepare for their Europa League Group H clash against the 2011 Ligue 1 champions on Thursday.

Such is the youngster's talent and will to succeed for his club, there's little doubt Barkley will be a key figure if Everton are going to lift the Europa League trophy in Warsaw next year - and what better way to start than by helping his side to take complete control of their group with three points at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy.

Everton's stuttering start to the Premier League campaign was handed a timely boost as Barkley returned last weekend and although his absence wasn't the sole reason for the Toffees' tough time, his 66 minutes against Villa showed exactly what Martinez had been missing and it's no coincidence that Barkley played a part in arguably his side's most impressive win of the season.

Barkley plays with a maturity beyond his years, but that doesn't detract from his almost schoolboy desire to attack and run directly at defenders with a confidence and directness that lifts the Everton faithful from their seats.

Last season, Barkley completed 80 take-ons, the fourth highest in the Premier League, and although he attempted just one on Saturday, his close control and threat on the ball meant the youngster was occupying two or three Villa players at once, which created pockets of space for his team-mates.

Kick-off: Thursday, October 23, 6pm

TV: ITV4 from 5.30pm

Romelu Lukaku will be the biggest beneficiary from Barkley's return and the £28million Belgian looked a much better player with the England international tucked into the No 10 role in support.

For all his self-confidence and obvious potential, Lukaku has been a source of frustration for Toffees fans so far this season, often looking leggy and showing a poor first touch around the opposition's box.

But with Barkley playing behind him, Lukaku actually looks worthy of his hefty price tag and will be grateful to his team-mate for the pass which led to the Belgian's third Premier League goal of the season.

And with 13 of his 16 goals last season coming while Barkley was on the pitch, it's no wonder Lukaku is so happy that his 'friend and brother' is back in a blue shirt.

The former Chelsea striker told Everton's official website: 'He is like a friend and brother to me off the pitch.

'I am very happy that he is back on it because he brings something that the whole team needs.'

In France on Thursday, Barkley looks set to make his European debut and with the Europa League being the gateway to the Champions League for the first time, he could soon find himself playing on Europe's elite stage should Martinez's side go all the way on their Road to Warsaw.

Barkley helps to knit Martinez's free-flowing football together, making space for Lukaku while bringing in Everton's marauding full backs Leighton Baines and Seamus Coleman, which will be key to Everton's game plan on Thursday night as they look to exploit a Lille side that have won just two of their last eight games in all competitions.

Lille may not have had the brightest start to their domestic campaign - 15 points from 10 matches - but they have more than enough to test Martinez's side.

Liverpool loanee Divock Origi will be looking to endear himself to Reds fans as the Belgian striker aims to add to his tally of five goals in all competitions for the French club against his Merseyside rivals to be.

Origi, who agreed a £10milllion move to Liverpool last summer on the back of an impressive World Cup, has been hailed as a 'monster' by compatriot and Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany and will provide a stern test for Everton's backline, whether he plays from the left or the centre of Lille's front three.

Without Barkley, the Toffees have recorded two impressive results in Europe so far, a resounding 4-1 win against Wolfsburg and a hard-fought 1-1 draw with Krasnodar in Russia, while Lille remain unbeaten but are yet to collect a win after two draws from their opening two games.

Everton fans tuning into ITV4 from 5.30pm on Thursday night will hope another fearless Barkley performance will inspire them to three points, while showing the rest of Europe why he was born to play football.
