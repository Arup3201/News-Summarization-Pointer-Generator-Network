Chelsea and Wolfsburg are inching closer to an agreement on Andre Schurrle with bonus payments the key. 

Wolfsburg general manager Klaus Allofs said: 'There is no agreement at the moment. The clock is running out. Our options are getting less hour by hour. It depends on money. We still would like to sign him.' 

Chelsea will announce the £26million signing of Juan Cudrado from Fiorentina on Monday morning after Mohamed Salah agreed to go on loan to the Italian side.
