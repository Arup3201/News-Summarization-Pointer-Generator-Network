When an SAS trooper came across a Nazi flag in a German officers' mess during a daring raid he immediately ripped it down as a mark of victory.

Trooper Henry Mullen then signed the red cloth along with 20 fellow SAS members 
who also added the names of their fallen comrades.

He seized the 3ft by 2ft Nazi flag in the Western Desert in North Africa in 1942, allowing his comrades to draw the elite 
squadron’s badge and the ‘He Who Dares, Wins’ motto on the material.

Now the flag has emerged after 70 years hidden away in the loft of Tpr Mullen's relatives, after he brought it back to Britain with him.

Piece of history: Trooper Henry Mullen seized the 3ft by 2ft Nazi flag in a German officers' mess in the Western Desert in North Africa in 1942

Memento: The flag was signed by him and 20 SAS members who added the names of fallen comrades to it

Although against the law in some European countries, the sale of Nazi memorabilia is legal in the UK.

In March, MPs called on the Government to ban the sale of Nazi memorabilia after items belonging to Holocaust victims were sold at a public auction.

Nazi memorabilia sales are illegal in France, Germany, Austria and Hungary.

The money from this auction will go to pay for a commemorative window at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire.

The stained glass window will be engraved with the names of SAS members who lost their lives in World War II.

And it's now up for sale in a bid to raise funds for SAS veterans after kindly relatives allowed it to be sold on. 

Two years after Tpr Mullen captured the flag he was executed alongside 30 other commandos after they were caught on a post-D-Day raid behind enemy lines in France.

The Swastika flag remained in his family but was kept in the attic of their Glasgow home for the next six decades.

It is now being tipped to sell at auction for £3,000 after it was given to the SAS Association in 2001.

Proud: The men also added to it the elite squadron’s badge and the 'He Who Dares, Wins' motto

Comrades: Men of the Long Range Desert Group (the SAS) returning from a 3-month trip behind enemy lines during war in North Africa - is was in the same area that Trooper Henry Mullen seized the Nazi flag

Keith Hartwell, from Mullocks 
auctioneers of Ludlow, Shrops, which is selling it, said: 'This is a 
fascinating relic from the war, taken as it was by the very early SAS.

'It is thought it was taken from a German officers’ mess and subsequently signed by 21 men.

'They
also wrote on it the places where they had been and seen action and the
names of two of their fallen comrades; Private Thomas Sillett and a 
Private Kendall.

'Henry Mullen brought it back with him. His family found it in their home in Glasgow and donated it to the SAS Association, which is now selling it to raise funds.

Remembrance: The men signed their signatures on the back of the flag which can be seen here fading

'It is a remarkable survivor and lists the names of some of the very first men who formed the SAS.'

The
Special Air Service was formed in 1941 by David Sterling and was 
originally called 'L' Detachment, Special Air Service Brigade.

It was conceived as a commando force to operate behind enemy lines in the North African Campaign.

Their orders were to attack enemy airfields and harass the Germans in any way possible.

Its
first mission was a disaster but its second in Lybia was hugely 
effective and destroyed 60 aircraft without loss.

Over months they repeatedly went into 
the desert and destroyed German planes - if their ammunition and bombs 
ran out the sometimes used their bare hands.

In 1942 it was 
re-named 1st SAS.

Names included on the flag include 
the ‘Originals’ Reg Seekings, Johnny Cooper and Warburton, as well as 
Harold White and Jimmy Storie.

Some of the locations where the men had fought including Benghazi and Sirte in Lybia and El Daba in Egypt.

After North Africa Tpr Mullen returned to Britain in preparation for D-Day.

On parade: A column of stormtroopers march past on the Tiegenhof holding the Nazi flag. For many victims of World War Two it came to symbolise repression and fear

He
participated in SAS Operation Bulbasket and was dropped into France 
just after D-Day to help disrupt the German advance towards the Normandy
beaches before being caught.

The auction takes place in Ludlow tomorrow and the money raised will go to pay for a commemorative window at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire.

The stained glass window will be engraved with the names of SAS members who lost their lives in World War Two.
