President Barack Obama invited Billy Joel for a cigarette when he visited the White House last year, according to the Washington rumor mill.

Despite having publicly announced he was quitting in 2007, both Obama and the iconic American singer allegedly dipped back into old habits for a smoke on the North Portico after an awards ceremony last year.

The reported indulgence came after a 2013 awards ceremony, where the President saw Joel given Kennedy Center Honors for his contribution to American culture.

Awards: Joel is recorded as visiting the White House in 2013 for the ceremony. He recalled the occasion last week in a meeting with Republican House Majority Leader John Boehner

According to political newspaper The Hill, Joel revealed the sly offer last week after winning another music award in the nation's capital.

He remembered the offer after receiving a similar one from House of Representatives speaker John Boehner, who presented him with a pack of cigarettes in his office.

He declined that offer, according to the report, but revealed that he was won over when the President made his approach.

Recalling the event, Joel reportedly said: 'I was at the White House recently, and President Obama did the same thing. He said,"‘I’m going out on the North Portico to have a smoke. Do you want to come with me?"

Despite his usual abstinence, Joel indicated that this time he said yes.

White House records show that Joel was mostly recently a visitor last December, when the Kennedy Center Honors awards took place.

Although Obama publicly pledged to stop smoking in 2007, he has since admitted that the occasional lapse is not unheard of.

The White House did not comment, while Billy Joel denied the story, telling MailOnline: 'I met John Boehner in his office and he asked me if I wanted to have a cigarette with him. I told him I quit. That was it.

'The Obama part of the story is completely untrue. Nothing like that that ever happened. I think their 'spy' had a few too many cocktails at that bar.'
