Research by Macmillan has shown that by 2016 361,000 people in Britain will be diagnosed with cancer each year (file picture) 

Almost 1,000 patients will be diagnosed with cancer every day by 2016, researchers warn.

Ironically, the rise in life expectancy means many more adults are living to an age when they are at higher risk of the illness.

But experts warn today that the NHS is facing a ‘cancer care crisis’ because it will not be able to adequately treat such high numbers of patients.

The charity Macmillan Cancer Support says ‘cracks’ are already beginning to show as so many more patients are now waiting longer for vital scans and treatment.

One woman with ovarian cancer said she was ordered to leave her bed whilst still recovering from chemotherapy because she had to make room.

Research by the charity shows that by 2016 a total of 361,000 people in Britain will be diagnosed with cancer each year. This is 100,000 more than the 263,000 in 1996.

The illness is becoming a growing financial burden and only yesterday charities warned that the Government may have to stop funding some life-extending drugs.

They are very concerned that several vital treatments for breast and prostate cancer will no longer be available through the Cancer Drugs Fund.

This is a pot of money set aside by the Government to pay for drugs which haven’t been approved by the rationing body NICE.

But there is such high demand that the fund is running out of money and officials may decide to take some drugs of the list next month.

The rise in cases is largely due to the aging population but it also partly down to lifestyle reasons such as obesity, smoking and alcohol.

Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said the rise in cases was further evidence of the ‘frightening magnitude’ of the illness.

‘Cracks in the NHS are already beginning to show. Whichever party is voted in at next year’s election, they will face a colossal challenge to make sure the NHS is ready to support the wave of people who will be diagnosed with cancer during their time in power.

‘To avoid a cancer care crisis we must take action as a nation now.’

The latest NHS figures show that the number of trusts missing the target to treat patients within 62 days of first being referred by a doctor has doubled in a year.

Last month, 64 failed to meet it compared to just 30 for the same period last year.

Patients say they are being made to feel like a ‘set of symptoms’ rather than humans because nurses are too busy to properly look after them.

Mary Jerome-Ayling, 64, from Sussex, who had breast cancer, said she had to wait hours for a seat to become available for chemotherapy.

‘Waiting for hours in a windowless cubby-hole was added to the stress and discomfort of chemotherapy. There were never enough seats for patients and their carers,’ she added.

‘Staff were so rushed that sometimes the infusion would finish and I would be sat there waiting for half an hour just for someone to take it out of my arm.

‘You just wanted to get out of there. It was clear that the staff were under so much pressure and it made you worried that mistakes could be made.’
