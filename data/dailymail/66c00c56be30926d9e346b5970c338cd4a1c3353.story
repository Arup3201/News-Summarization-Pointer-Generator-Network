The body of a U.S. Marine who fell to his death from a military aircraft during a training flight has been found.

Spokesman Mike Barton said the body of Stephen Hancock from Coal City, Illinois, was found on Tuesday.

Barton said Hancock was a member of the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and a crewmember of an Osprey that was conducting a training flight on Monday evening.

Nobody knows what happened but Barton said it appears the Hancock died as a result of the fall. The aircraft had taken part in a training exercise at the airport in Elizabethtown.

'We did not learn of his fall immediately and we are not sure why,' 1st Lt. Hector Alejandro, spokesman for the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, told NBC News on Wednesday.

'It's going to be investigated. It is unfortunate the length of time it took, and honestly we don't know how long that was.

 in Ospreys are always supposed to be secured, either by seat belts or 
tether cables. He didn't know how the missing Marine was secured.

The Marine's identity wasn't immediately released pending notification of his family.

The Osprey has the speed and range of a turboprop airplane but the vertical maneuverability of a helicopter.

Bladen County Coroner Hubert Kinlaw said the body was discovered on state forestry land 96 miles south of Raleigh.

The Marine disappeared about 45 miles west of Marine Corps Air Station New River. Barton said he didn't know how high the Osprey was flying or the number of crew aboard at the time of the accident.

Ten helicopters backed up by 100 marines searched for the body on the ground and in the air.

The Osprey had been performing 'touch and go' maneuvers, where a pilot lands and immediately takes off without coming to a stop, at a nearby airport before the incident.

The cargo door of an Osprey - which can take off like a helicopter and fly like a plane - remains open during this exercise but marines are always tethered in accordance with standard operational procedure.
