A university professor in Austin, Texas, has moved into a 33sq ft dumpster, which he plans to call home for an entire year.Â 

Dr. Jeff Wilson, a Harvard-educated environmental science professor, took up residence in the trash can Tuesday in an effort to show students at Huston-Tillotson University, and the world, that humans can live on a smaller scale and lessen our environmental impact.

Thankfully for Wilson, who's now known as Professor Dumpster, his new home isn't your ordinary smelly dumpster but will be getting kitted out by his students so it includes creature comforts like a shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet.

Dumpster time: Dr. Jeff Wilson, pictured Tuesday, Dean of the University College and Associate Professor of Biological Sciences at Huston-Tillotson University, moved into a 33-square foot dumpster on the campus of Huston-Tillotson University in Austin, Texas on Tuesday

Outfitting the tiny space is step one in the trash can challenge, and the goal is to design the dumpster to be as energy efficient as possible, with solar panels and an energy producing toilet.

'The idea here is to ultimately show one can have a pretty good life in a dumpster,' Wilson told Fast Company.

However, the dumpster is starting off modestly. Tuesday night, the 6ft 1in Professor Dumpster posted a picture of his new abode on Twitter with a maroon sleeping bag laid out tightly in the small space with little else in view.

If occasionally Wilson needs a break from the box, students can opt to take his place for the night.

One student, Evette Jackson, has already signed up.

Mod cons: Thankfully for Wilson, pictured, his new home isn't your ordinary smelly dumpster but a special version customized by his students that includes creature comforts like a shower, kitchen, bed, WiFi and toilet

Not very big: Wilson posted a picture of his new home on Twitter Tuesday with the comment 'Bird's eye view of dumpster home at bedtime'

'I think it's pretty intriguing,' she told KVUE. 'It's pretty cool. I want to live in it too.'

After the year of dumpster living is up, Wilson plans on taking the bin across the United States, educating students about the possibility of following in his 'less is more' footsteps.

Wilson said the project idea came to him two years ago while he was sipping a latte at Starbucks.

'I looked out the window into the parking lot and saw an eight-yard dumpster and had some sort of strange flash that I was definitely moving into a dumpster,' he told Fast Company.

So when the lease ran out on his lovely, full-sized, apartment a year later, he posted an announcement on Facebook, which read: 'Starting at 6pm, I will be selling all of my home furnishings, clothes, kitchen appliances, and everything else in the apartment for $1 an item.'

Help: Wilson, right, had help from students and other educators including Dr Karen Magid, pictured

Concerns: A week before move in, Wilson wrote a list of his concerns with 'heating' number one

Despite, the five-item-per-person 
maximum, his home was empty by nightfall except for a modest suitcase, 
which was coming with him to the dumpster.

However, the dumpster wasn't ready at this stage, so he moved into his office for the next seven months, secretly sleeping on the floor.

'Keeping that secret for seven months, especially from the 3 a.m. cleaning staff and 24-hour security, much less the students and my colleagues, was interesting in itself,' he told the website.

But the low-impact living experiment, officially known as The Dumpster Project, is finally ready to begin - and it has the university's backing.

Scrub: Five days ago, Wilson was giving his dumpster a clean out

Cute: Wilson posted a picture of him and his girlfriend two weeks ago with the comment, 'Honey, I'm home. This place looks like a dump'

Vs: Wilson's previous front porch was slightly more desirable

'I'm essentially becoming part of the
 1 per cent, he jokes. 'This dumpster is 33 sq ft, which is 1 per cent 
the size of the new American home...'

But as he undergoes this transformation, so will his students in campus dorms, whom he'll expect to replace light-bulbs and install low-flow shower heads.

The goal is to bring sustainability to the center of the college experience.

'What we are talking about right now is to start a green movement within historically black colleges and universities, and become the flagship school of that, under an initiative called "Green is the New Black,"' he told Fast Company.

In the meantime, Wilson says he's going to take his dumpster life one day at a time. 'It's going to be pretty overwhelming,' he said. 'I can't think too far ahead in this project and stay sane.'
