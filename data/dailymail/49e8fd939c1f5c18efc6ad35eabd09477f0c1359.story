A lawyer who tried to redeem a multi-million dollar state lottery ticket last night gave up his claim for the jackpot after officials called it into question.

Crawford Shaw, 76, of Bedford, New York, withdrew his claim in Iowa to a $10.3million ticket after officials demanded to know who he represented.

His mysterious decision - made ‘because I'm not going to argue with the lottery’ - ends one of the strangest jackpot pursuits of all time.

Mystery: Iowa Lottery CEO Terry Rich said on Thursday that it's the strangest situation officials can recall in the 26-year history of the lottery

The winning ticket was turned in last month on December 29, less than two hours before it would have expired a year after the drawing.

Iowa Lottery officials tested and validated the ticket - but refused to pay out until they could verify the purchaser's identity, among other things.

Officials identified the recipient as a corporation in Belize, Central America. The ticket was bought at a Des Moines petrol station in December 2010.

The lottery now wants to know how Mr Shaw obtained the ticket to make sure it was not stolen and that a valid player bought it.

Mr Shaw, who had signed the ticket as a 
trustee for an entity he called the Hexham Investments Trust, never 
revealed who was in the trust.

But officials said he misspelled the 
name of the Bedford trust by leaving off the second ‘h’. Mr Shaw claimed
not to be a beneficiary of the trust.

'If we knew the details, we'd probably be writing a cheque tonight'

In addition he told the Des Moines Register that he doesn’t know the identity of the person or people behind Hexham Investments Trust.

Iowa Lottery officials gave him a deadline to tell them who he represented by 3pm local time today or forget about collecting the millions.

In the meantime, the lottery revealed that Mr Shaw was ‘associated with criminal proceedings and bankruptcy filings in New York and Delaware’.

Mr Shaw is the ex-CEO of bankrupt public 
firm Industrial Enterprises of America - allegedly looted in a 
$100million securities fraud scheme.

The chemical company, which Mr Shaw helped found, was looted and bankrupted in 2009 by a stock manipulation scheme.

'(The probe will) ensure the integrity of the lottery and to determine whether those involved complied with state law'

He was not charged with criminal wrongdoing but is a defendant in a civil suit by the firm. Mr Shaw claims to know nothing about the suit.

In any case, he chose to call off his pursuit of the winning ticket payout, asking a Des Moines law firm to pass along his decision to lottery officials.

The Iowa Lottery said that it received confirmation of Mr Shaw’s claim withdrawal shortly after 6pm on Thursday.

The
lottery recently asked state criminal investigators to probe the 
circumstances surrounding the purchase and redemption of the ticket.

'I'm telling you, if I could take all of the suggestions it would be a heck of a fun book'

Asked if he thought he'd get to the bottom of what happened, Mr Rich said: ‘If we knew the details, we'd probably be writing a cheque tonight.’

‘I'm telling you, if I could take all of the suggestions (about the ticket being stolen), it would be a heck of a fun book,' he added.

Mr Shaw said on Wednesday that if the jackpot were paid, the money would be donated to charity. He declined to comment further on Thursday.

‘It doesn't get much weirder than this,’ Iowa Lottery spokesman Mary Neubauer told the Des Moines Register.
