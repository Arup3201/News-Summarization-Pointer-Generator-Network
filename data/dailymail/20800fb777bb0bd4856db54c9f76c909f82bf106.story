Click here to read Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher pen on Gerrard's Liverpool exit.

Steven Gerrard admitted leaving Liverpool was the toughest decision of his life as he confirmed that his days at Anfield will end this summer.

And the 34-year-old insisted he is going purely because he wants to sample a different way of life before he hangs his boots up — not through any fall-out with the club’s manager or owners.

Gerrard looks certain to end up playing in America after insisting he won’t go anywhere that could result in him having to line up against his boyhood club.

Gerrard had been offered a new deal by his club but has decided to leave Anfield after 26 years

Gerrard scored 13 times for Liverpool last season, coming agonisingly close to his first Premier League title

695 games, 180 goals

1 Champions League 

2 FA Cups

3 League Cups 

1 UEFA Cup

2 UEFA Super Cups

1 Charity Shield

Gerrard said: ‘This has been the toughest decision of my life and one which both me and my family have agonised over for a good deal of time.

‘I am making the announcement now so that the manager and the team are not distracted by stories or speculation about my future.’

Gerrard, who was only offered a contract extension in November, could even return to play for Liverpool, with the club keeping the door open for a loan deal if he does move to the USA.

In a statement on the club’s website, Gerrard added: ‘Liverpool Football Club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it’s something that’s in the best interests of all involved, including my family and the club.

‘I’m going to carry on playing and although I can’t confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won’t be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool — that is something I could never contemplate.

‘My decision is completely based on my wish to experience something different and I want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is over.

‘I can’t thank Brendan (Rodgers), the owners and everyone at the club enough for how they’ve handled this and I am leaving on great terms. Also, I would like to thank my team-mates and all the staff for their help and continued support.

‘It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club.’

Gerrard’s new challenge will almost certainly mean a move to the MLS.

New York Red Bulls, for whom former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier is head of global football, and LA Galaxy are the clubs leading the race.

He would then have the potential to return on a short-term loan, similar to Thierry Henry’s move to Arsenal when he was playing for New York Red Bulls, or the two spells that LA Galaxy striker Landon Donovan had with Everton in 2010 and 2012.

However, Real Sociedad manager David Moyes said: ‘If he ever wanted to come to play in Spain, he knows he can phone me.’

Liverpool manager Rodgers will face the media this morning ahead of Monday’s trip to AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup.

Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003

The Liverpool skipper has often been the man to bail his team out on the big occasion with an important goal

Gerrard was instrumental in his sides run to the Champions League final to win their fifth European title

Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals

FA Cup: 39, 13

League Cup: 28, 9

Champions League: 87, 30

UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42, 11

Other: 5, 1

TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals

On the back of Jamie Carragher’s retirement and the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, this is a third huge departure he must tackle in the space of 18 months.

Rodgers had recommended that Gerrard be given a contract extension.

Liverpool’s manager admitted he had an ‘impossible task’ to try to explain how Gerrard had helped him since he arrived at Anfield in 2012 and added: ‘As a leader and as a man, he is probably incomparable to anyone I have ever worked with.

‘He takes professionalism to a new level and the dedication he has to his work is an example to everyone in the game. He has always put the club and team ahead of himself and I think that will ultimately be his legacy.’

Fenway Sports Group — Liverpool’s owners — outlined their hope that Gerrard would return to Anfield. Tom Werner and John W Henry said in a joint statement: ‘Steven will always have a part to play for this club, as and when the time comes that he wishes to return.’

Kenny Dalglish: ‘He has made a massive contribution to the club for a long time and that is why he is revered on Merseyside and beyond. Liverpool are lucky to have had a player like him and a man like him for so long.’

Jordan Henderson: ‘The lads can go to him with anything and he will always help them out and put them first. With the aura that he has got, he could be a different person but he is very humble.’

Mario Balotelli: ‘Wow. I think of him as being at the same level as (Andrea) Pirlo. Vision, technique, but he is powerful as well. Stevie can do anything. An amazing player.’

Rafa Benitez: ‘He changed games against Olympiacos (in 2004), AC Milan (the 2005 Champions League final) and West Ham (2006 FA Cup final). I think he was one of the best, if not the best, for sure.’ 

Peter Crouch: ‘I’ve been fortunate to have played with some top players in my time but Stevie G is easily the best I have played with.’

Ronald Koeman: ‘If he likes to continue, he can come (here). I am serious. For Steven Gerrard, you have always a position for him. He is a fantastic football player, really at the top level.’

John Aldridge: ‘I always knew he was going to be a star. I’ve been watching Liverpool for 50 years and he is the best player I have ever seen.’

Graeme Souness: ‘He would get in any team that Liverpool have had that I know of. He certainly would have got in the team when we played, when we were dominating the game.’

Michael Owen: ‘It has been a privilege to play so many games for both Liverpool and England with Steven Gerrard and he has undoubtedly earned his status as a true footballing legend.’

Ray Houghton: ‘He has been a fantastic servant for the club. He has seen some of the tough times as well as the good times. To go out season after season shows the character of the player. First class.’

Daniel Sturridge: ‘He will go down in history as one of the best midfielders. He’s just unbelievable every day. The perfect example for every young player.’

Gerard Houllier: ‘He’s a kind-hearted, generous person... a great personality. He made a lot of sacrifices. I wouldn’t be surprised if he returned to Anfield as boss.’ 

Raheem Sterling: ‘He has been brilliant for me. He’s always looking after me, always checking to see if I’m all right. He’s an inspiration and a great captain.’

Gary Lineker: ‘Seems Steven Gerrard is set to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. One of the finest players to have graced the PL. A top, top player.’
