A Staten Island Catholic school is reeling after allegations the athletic director turned a blind eye to affairs female members of staff were having with teenage students.

The NYPD has began an investigation at the $8,000 a year Moore Catholic High School, after gym teacher, Megan Mahoney, 25, is alleged to have been caught in a months-long affair with a 16-year-old member of the basketball team.

Athletic director, Richard Postiglione, is accused of failing to report any suspicions of sexual misconduct at the school after first being told in 2006 that affairs between students and teachers were carrying on.

According to the New York Post, Mahoney, who also acted as the assistant athletic director at the school, would pick up the 16-year-old boy in her car and drive him to secluded parts of Staten Island, where they would conduct their trysts.

'We would just drive around and do it in the car,' said the boy to the Post.

The teen, whose name is being withheld, added that at no point did the two ever discuss the illegal nature of their relationship.

'We were never boyfriend-girlfriend,' he said. 'It was cool. I knew it wasn’t going anywhere. I told my best friend and like three kids.'

Mahoney was questioned by police after the teens ex-girlfriend followed them one day to a diner in January and phoned 911.

The teacher has denied having a sexual affair with the student.

However, the boy's parents told the New York Post that they saw their son and Mahoney together and assumed she was a student.

'She looks young,' said the father. 'You'd never know.'

The allegations of a cover-up center around what Postiglione knew about the alleged illegal affair.

'Richie knew all about it,' an anonymous source told the New York Post. They alleged that they were told about the affair by the teenagers best friend and that he then told school principal, Bob Manisero.

'Bob told me Postiglione had investigated and there was no truth to it. He told me she came from an upstanding Catholic family. But there was notorious gossip all over the school. These boys didn’t keep quiet.'

According to the Post, the same source emailed Postiglione and the school board chairman, Anthony Ferreri in December and told then of their concerns about the alleged affair.

'If you remember I had reported some activity some time ago about a basketball coach that I had learned,' the December 19, 2013 email reads according to the Post.

'Rich thought it was untrue even though I knew it was correct…I was told they are in LOVE…Hope you have followed legal protocol to report even when there is no witness.'

Concern: Rumors of covered up affairs between teachers and students at Moore High School have been ride for years

The Post alleges that Postiglione, Manisero and Ferreri were all aware of the supposed affair, but did not inform child-protection authorities.

It is believed though, that Postiglione confronted Mahoney about the alleged affair and made her end it.

After the alleged affair was outed in January, the teen was subject to appalling treatment at school, his mother alleges.

'They wanted to get rid of my son, get him out of the school,' said the boy's mom.

Initial investigations by the Post allege that Mahoney had an affair with another 16-year-old boy in 2012 and Postiglione knew of another affair in 2006 or 2007 and did not report it.
