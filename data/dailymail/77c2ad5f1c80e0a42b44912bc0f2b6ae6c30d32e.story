Reaching for an alarm clock or searching the sofa cushions for a remote control could soon be a thing of the past – thanks to our all-powerful smartphones.

A list of the products at risk of becoming obsolete is topped by alarm clocks, but also includes small-screen TVs, sat navs and iPod docks.

Experts said sat navs are under threat as manufacturers build them into most new cars and phone navigation apps become increasingly common.

Alarm clocks come top of a list of products at risk of becoming obsolete in 2014 due to the rise of smartphones

In the kitchen, small portable TVs are being replaced by tablets that can deliver HD on demand.

Remote controls are also in decline as phone and tablet apps let users control a number of devices from one place.

The rise of smart TVs that use motion sensors to change channels is also contributing to the decline of the remote control.

Cheap
 camcorders known as flip cameras are the fourth most endangered, 
watches are number seven, and Blackberries are at number eight, the list
 by retail site PIXmania.com shows.

Kieran
 Alger, editor of technology magazine T3, added: ‘It’s a cliche to say 
that technology moves fast but we’re seeing that pace of change quicken.

‘At the centre of 
everything is the smartphone. It’s the most important device we all own 
and it’s single-handedly threatening a wide range of other product 
categories as it adds more weapons to its arsenal.’

Another popular gadget on the endangered list is the iPod dock, which is under pressure from Apple’s Airplay and Bluetooth streaming, and music streaming apps.

Remote controls are also in decline thanks to the smartphone as phone and tablet apps let users control a number of different devices in one place.

As well as being more customisable there is also the option for people to change the channel and tweet their reason for doing so.

The rise of smart TVs that use motion controls to change channels are also contributing to the decline of the remote control.

Flip cameras come in at fourth most endangered, watches at number seven, and Blackberries at number eight.

Laurent Cohen, of online shop PIXmania.com, who carried out the research, said: 'As technology evolves and people become more comfortable with the latest tech, older gadgets are naturally pushed into retirement.

'Our team of tech experts are constantly reviewing the products we have on offer to ensure we are offering the best ones out there so the good news for consumers is that there’s often a far better replacement.'

Kieran Alger, the editor at technology magazine T3, added: 'It’s a cliche to say that technology moves fast but we’re seeing that pace of change quicken.

'Technologies like Blu-ray that aren’t really that old are already looking a bit beleaguered with new on-demand services coming thick and fast to take their place.

'However, at the centre of everything is the smartphone. It’s the most important device we all own and it’s single handedly threatening a wide range of other product categories as it adds more weapons its arsenal and grows ever more powerful.'

Smart TVs, such as this LG Smart TV, which uses motion controls to change channels could also contribute to the decline of the remote control
