A toddler has become the youngest in the country to be fitted with a life-saving device after constant blood transfusions caused her veins to fail. 

Chloe Gray suffers from a rare blood disorder and has depended on blood transfusions her whole life, receiving her first two while still in the womb.

At just 15 months old, little Chloe's veins have collapsed, exhausted by the constant and invasive procedures.

Brave girl: Chloe Gray, who is 15 months old, has become the youngest in the country to be fitted with a life-saving device after constant blood transfusions caused her veins to fail

Now she has become the youngest in the UK to be fitted with a special port on her chest through which doctors will carry out future transfusions.

The condition, Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, means that the tot needs blood transfusions every four weeks to stay alive. 

At just one day old, she underwent a full blood exchange and since then has been in and out of the Sunderland Royal Hospital with mother Francesca and father Craig. 

Depending on her weight, Chloe usually receives more than a third of a pint of blood, which takes up to three hours to carry out.

But after 15 months of the exhausting and invasive procedures, little Chloe's veins collapsed. 

Francesca, 20, said: 'It doesn't get 
any easier. I still can't watch them doing it because she gets that 
upset. You never get used to it.

'It's a long day in hospital, but most of the time it doesn't bother Chloe, she just gets on with it.

Getting on with life: Chloe, from Sunderland, suffers from rare blood disorder, Diamond Blackfan Anaemia, and has needed blood transfusions her whole life

'It never gets better for us, though.'

Thanks to the life-saving device, Francesca and Craig Bowser are hopeful that Chloe's quality of life will improve.  Medics carried out an operation that saw a tube fed through a cut in her neck.

It was then threaded through her heart valve and fed through to the port, which is implanted in her left chest.

The device makes it easier and quicker for medics to take blood and carry out the transfusions.

Parents Francesca and Craig Bowser hope that by showing what their precious daughter has to go through to survive, more people will donate blood.

Francesca, of Plains Farm, added: 'We want to show people what Chloe has to go through every month just to stay alive.

'It's so important that people give blood because if it wasn't for them there's no doubt about it, Chloe wouldn't be here.

'Giving blood is literally life-changing and is the difference between Chloe being here and not being here.

'She's had to have blood since before she was even born and we were told when I was pregnant at 20 weeks that she wouldn't survive more than ten hours and if it wasn't for people giving blood, she would have died.

'To live, Chloe has no other option than to have blood transfusions.'
