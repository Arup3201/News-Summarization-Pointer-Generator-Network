It's a mystery that has confounded military experts around the world for years.

The top-secret X-37B space drone, which landed in California on Friday, has spent nearly two years orbiting Earth on a classified mission.

Theories have ranged from it being a space bomber ready to attack in a matter of hours, to a clandestine probe on a mission to 'take out' spy satellites.

The mystery spacecraft, which some say could be being used for spying, has landed at the  Vandenberg Air Force Base in California after almost to years in orbit

One leading secrecy expert told MailOnline that the drone is 'very likely' to be a US spy plane.

'The US government has a bottomless appetite for sensitive information,' said Steven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists.

'As powerful as our intelligence satellites may be, they also have their limitations - most notably the limitations imposed by their orbital parameters.

'It's conceivable that a spy plane would introduce new versatility into overhead reconnaissance.

'The usual suspects would be targets. For instance, Iran or North Korea, or the various battle zones in the Middle East and elsewhere.'

One leading secrecy expert has told MailOnline that the drone (artist's impression pictured) is 'very likely' to be a US spy plane. Earlier this year, the editor of Spaceflight magazine claimed the space plane was spying on the Chinese space station

Earlier this year, the editor of Spaceflight magazine claimed the space plane was spying on the Chinese space station, arguing that the orbit of the X-37B was close to that of the Tiangong centre.

The U.S. Air Force's unmanned X-37B space plane has flown three secret missions to date.

Each time it has carried a mystery payload on long-duration flights in Earth orbit.

The spacecraft looks similar to Nasa's space shuttle but is much smaller. The X-37B is about 29ft (8.8m) long and 9.5ft (2.9 m) tall.

It has a wingspan of just less than 15ft (4.6 m). At launch, it weighs 11,000lbs (4,990kg).

The craft is taken into orbit on a rocket but lands like the space shuttle by gliding down to Earth.

But Brian Weeden,  a former Air Force officer who worked at U.S. Strategic Command's Joint Space Operations Center, pointed out that X-37B couldn't keep a constant eye on the Chinese space station.

'Even though there may be a brief chance at some point for the X-37B to collect intelligence [on the Chinese space station], that certainly is not the main mission, or even something all that feasible,' said. 

Other theories sound straight out of a James Bond film, including that the spacecraft would be able to capture the satellites of other nations. 

A space bomber that can attack anywhere in the world within a matter of hours has also been put forward by conspiracy theorists.

'Of all the possibilities, that strikes me as probably the least likely because it's the least necessary,' said Mr Aftergood. 'The US military has global reach without it.' 

The X-37B space drone, otherwise known as the Orbital Test Vehicle, has been in flight since December 2012 on a secret mission.  

Like a shuttle, X-37B is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft. The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite

The space plane is a spy plane: The leading theory appears to be that the unmanned space plane is a shuttle-shaped surveillance vehicle. 

It could be a space bomber: This is the least likely theory, according tot Seven Aftergood, a secrecy expert at the Federation of American Scientists. He claims the US doesn't need this capability. 

It is on a mission is to 'take out' satellites: This activity would be easily traceable, making it unlikely to stay a secret. 

The X-37B deploys spy satellites: Instead of destroying them, the theory suggests that the space plane's orbit matches up to where deployed satellites would work best for spying on other countries.

The X-program has bounced between several federal agencies, Nasa among them, since 1999.

The plane has been in space for a total of 674 days, far more than its two previous flights which lasted 225 and 469 days.

The program's first mission launched in April 2010 and landed in December that year. 

The second space plane took off on March 2011 and came back to Earth in June 2012.

According to X-37B manufacturer Boeing, the space plane operates in low-earth orbit, between 110 and 500 miles above earth. 

By comparison, the International Space Station orbits at about 220 miles. 

Both top secret missions ended at Vandenberg base, but this may soon change as Boeing, which built the shuttles, is working to renovate a Nasa hangar at the Kennedy Space Centre, which could become X-37B's new home.

Nasa last week said it has entered into an agreement with the Air Force's X-37B program for use of the Kennedy Space Center's Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) Bays 1 and 2 - former space shuttle hangars.

Boeing is performing construction upgrades in those facilities that are targeted to be complete in December.

All missions so far have launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida.

While the airplane looks like Nasa's retired space shuttles, it has its own identity.

Like a shuttle, it is blasted into orbit by a rocket. However, it lands using a runway like a normal aircraft.

The X-37B is too small to carry people onboard, but does have a cargo bay similar to that of a pickup truck, which is just large enough to carry a small satellite.

'It's misleading, the idea that secret programmes like this have achieved important technological breakthroughs – it's a seductive idea but misleading,' Mr Aftergood told MailOnline.

'Based on experience of past programmes, this craft has gone far beyond the secret programme stage, it's existence is now an acknowledged fact,

'Some sort of explanation of its function is likely to come, if not this year, then I guess within five years.'
