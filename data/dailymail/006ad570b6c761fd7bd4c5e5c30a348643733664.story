Dressed in blue, the disabled boy lies listlessly on the pavement in Mumbai, his ankle tethered with rope to a bus stop.

Following its release last month, the picture of nine-year-old Lakhan Kale captured hearts across the world.

Now, Lakhan's grandmother has revealed the heartbreaking truth behind the youngster's plight.

Heartbreaking: Lakhan Kale is pictured lying listlessly on the pavement in Mumbai, his ankle tethered with rope to a pole of a bus stop. The nine-year-old cannot speak or hear and suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy

Sakubai Kale, who is in her 70s, spent years living in poverty on the dirty stretch of pavement with her grandson, who cannot hear or speak and suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy.

Speaking to CNN, she explained how she became Lakhan's sole carer after his father died four years ago, his mother left and his older sister ran away.

She said she had tried to earn a small living for the pair by selling toys, flower garlands and trinkets on Chowpatty, a renowned beachfront in the heart of the Indian city.

At these times, Sakubai said she had had 'no choice' but to tie Lakhan to the red-coloured poles of bus stop 58, which is shaded by the hanging roots of a banyan tree.

'He is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming. If he ran on to the road, he would get killed,' said the pensioner, who still lives on the pavement, surviving off food she buys from a vendor.

At night, she said she would tie Lakhan to her own leg so she would know if he tried to walk away.

Speaking through tears, Sakubai told of how her grandson's disabilities had emerged after he developed a fever at just a few months old.

'One night, he shook violently,' she said. 'He 
was never the same again.'

Family: The pensioner said she had 'no choice' but to tie up Lakhan while she was away due to his disabilities

She said she had finally made the decision to tie up Lakhan for his own safety, using a 'long' cloth rope which would not damage his ankle.

Although thousands of pedestrians strolled past Lakhan unwittingly, a photograph of him tied up eventually appeared in a local newspaper last month.

It sparked concern among charities and the police - with activists claiming he was just one of many disabled people in India facing daily stigma and a lack of facilities to assist them.

At the time, Sakubai defended her actions, saying: 'What else can I do? He can't talk, so how will he tell anyone if he gets lost?'

Disabled: Lakhan, who was tied up using a 'long' cloth rope, is pictured strolling along the dirty stretch of pavement where he was raised. He is now being looked after at a state-run institution in south Mumbai

Following the picture's release, social worker Meena Mutha placed Lakhan in a state-run institution in south Mumbai at the request of a local police constable.

As the youngster was led away, his grandmother bid him a tearful goodbye, but said she was 'happy' he was going to be looked after.

Sakubai added that she was hopeful she would get to see Lakahan regularly once she acquired an 
official identity card that would allow her to visit the centre.

Although the institution Lakhan is currently residing at takes in a range of needy children, Ms Mutha said it failed to cater specifically for those with special needs. 

She said she wants to find Lakhan more of a 'home', but that there is a serious shortage of suitable facilities in Mumbai.

'Residential homes are very, very few. There's a major need for the government to do something, a social responsibility to provide residential centres for children like Lakhan,’ she said.

In February, a long-awaited bill was introduced into the Indian parliament aiming to give disabled people equal rights, including access to education, employment and legal redress against discrimination. However, the bill is yet to be passed.
