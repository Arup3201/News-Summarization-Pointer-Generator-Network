Penny for the thoughts of Paul Merson, the former Arsenal striker who branded Arsene Wenger 'tactically clueless' after they surrendered a 3-0 lead against Anderlecht in the Champions League.

Arsenal weren't held by a Belgian club on Sunday, though. Instead it was a Welsh side that beat the north London club and moved above them in the Barclays Premier League table in doing so.

Arsenal again capitulated in a second half with Swansea City the grateful recipients this time.

Television pundit Merson accused Arsenal of being 'like an Under-12 team, all bombing forward', and Wenger responded with a personal attack on the player he once managed.

'I managed him. I tried. I'm not interested in Paul Merson. These debates I hear are a joke, a farce,' the Frenchman said.

But amid Wenger vs Merson, Arsenal had a match at the Liberty Stadium to prepare for.

Swansea threatened more in the first 45 minutes. Arsenal were rarely given  time to mount an attack with their 4-4-2 system, though they ended the half the stronger.

Arsenal forwards Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck had one shot to show between them by the break, and it came from the former Manchester United player in the 44th minute.

A clever one-two left Welbeck with only Lukasz Fabianski to beat on an angle. The ex-Arsenal goalkeeper made an instinctive save, and it remained 0-0 in monsoon-like conditions.

Arsenal certainly ended the half in better shape than they started it. An Aaron Ramsey volley here, a Per Mertesacker header there, but neither could trouble Fabianski.

Wenger instructed his team to use their pace and cease the predictability that hindered them in the first half. They did so, as Sanchez mustered his first shot in the 61st minute.

Then, the partnership worked. An Arsenal counter-attack saw Welbeck sprint down the right, before cutting inside and assisting Sanchez to score his eighth Premier League goal in 10 games.  

But, as against Anderlecht on Tuesday night, Wenger's men lost their way in the latter stages.

Again, former Barcelona forward Sanchez saw another of his goals go to  waste.

In three minutes Arsenal went from 1-0 up to 2-1 down - and they have Manchester United next. 

Wenger has managed just four Premier League wins this season and, if actions speak louder than words, the Arsenal boss did little to prove Merson wrong.
