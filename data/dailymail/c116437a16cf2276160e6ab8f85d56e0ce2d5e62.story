Waste of money? Sheffield City Council is planning to spend £400,000 advising residents on changes to bin collections... after slashing 550 jobs

Council bosses agreed to axe 550 jobs - then decided to spend £400,000 advising residents on how to empty their bins.

Sheffield City Council is planning to switch bin collections from weekly to fortnightly in a bid to save £1.6million over the next year.

But the council revealed it could cost £1million to switch the service and another £400,000 in 'appropriate communication' with residents.

Services are to be slashed as the council tries to find £55million in savings in the next financial year.

Taxpayers will have to foot a £13million bill for the agreed 550 redundancies, most of which councillors hope will be voluntary.

Union official admitted they had been consulted and said they were ‘satisfied’ with the decisions.

Switching black bin collections will lead to 40 job losses at contractors Veolia and a total cost of £1m for 'changeover costs'.

A further £400,000 will be spent on 'appropriate communication to ensure customers understand the changes'.

Moving from a weekly to fortnightly bin collection is one of several  controversial
cost-cutting measures announced by the council in recent months.

The move aims to save 
£1.6million in this financial year and £2.4million in subsequent years.

Other cuts will be made to care and support services, arts and culture and grants for city centre events.

Charges will be increased for services including use of parks and sports pitches and car park permits.

In 2011/12, the council had to save £80m and cut around 800 jobs. It faces continued cuts until at least 2015/16 when the budget will have been reduced by £170m.

Council leader Julie Dore confirmed the authority would accept the Government’s offer of a grant to freeze council tax next year - despite the long-term financial implications.

She said: 'I believe we have been dealt an unfair hand by the Government, but we have taken extremely difficult decisions to deliver a fair deal for the people of Sheffield.

'We have ensured that we have protected the most vulnerable and at the same time we have protected the services that the people of Sheffield rely on and enjoy.'

John Mothersole, Sheffield Council’s chief executive, said the budget had been managed so that the heaviest burden fell on ‘back office’ functions like information technology services.

He added: 'Services like adult social care will be reduced by five per cent, while IT will see a 26 per cent cut, human resources a 15 per cent cut and business strategy a 29 per cent drop.

'The job losses we are announcing are at the top end of the range we had anticipated, and we expect at least another year of cuts after this.'

Mr Mothersole said the council would be forced to put £13m on one side to pay for redundancy settlements and faced higher bills because of increased demand for services and inflation.

Rod Padley, of public sector union Unison, which represents 8,000 workers in the city, said union officials met senior councillors and officers each week.

He added: 'We believe the council has done all it can to mitigate redundancy and maximise job opportunities for those under threat. The situation has been imposed on Sheffield by the Government.'

The move comes after an announcement by Communities Secretary Eric Pickles that more than 70 councils intend to use a £250million government fund to end unpopular fortnightly refuse collections.

Squeezed households across Britain will have to endure soaring council tax bills this year as local authorities continue to slash budgets.

Up to a fifth are warning they may need to increase rates to protect services, despite the Government's offer of nearly £1billion to fund a freeze.
