A riot squad officer ‘whose blood was up’ after he was humiliated by a protester killed a defenceless bystander during the G20 demonstrations, a court heard yesterday.

PC Simon Harwood, 45, is accused of lashing out at Ian Tomlinson, 47, in a ‘gratuitous act of aggression’ after he ‘lost self-control’.

Harwood hit Mr Tomlinson with a ‘forceful baton strike followed by a powerful push to the back which sent him flying to the ground’, a jury was told.

Pc Simon Harwood, 41 (right), seen arriving at Southwark Crown Court is accused of the manslaughter of Ian Tomlinson (left) during the G20 demonstrations in April 2009.

Mr Tomlinson, a newspaper vendor, had 
been walking home from work but had been prevented from taking his usual
route due to the protests in the City of London in April 2009.

At the time, Harwood was said to be 
bristling with aggression after a protester had scrawled ‘all cops are 
bastards’ on a police carrier.

Prosecutor Mark Dennis QC compared Harwood to a thug during the opening of the trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He said: ‘It was a rush of blood to 
the head. It was unnecessary aggression more akin to thuggish behaviour 
than proper reasonable policing.

‘There had been no need to use any 
force upon Tomlinson, let alone a forceful baton strike followed by a 
powerful push to the back that sent [him] flying to the ground.

‘The display of force has all the 
hallmarks, we submit, of a gratuitous act of aggression by a lone 
officer whose blood was up having lost the self-control to be expected 
of a police officer in such circumstances and who was going to stand no 
truck from anyone who appeared to him to be a protester and to be 
getting in his way.'

Mr Tomlinson was not posing a threat 
to anyone and was ‘ambling along’, oblivious to the protests and ‘simply
minding his own business’ when Harwood set upon him, Mr Dennis said.

The court heard that Mr Tomlinson was 
stood with his hands in his pockets and his back to the police lines 
when Harwood is said to have suddenly struck his thigh with a baton and 
violently pushed him to the ground.

Mr Tomlinson was sent crashing to the pavement, causing catastrophic internal bleeding.

Mr Dennis said: ‘Having struck Tomlinson and sent him flying to the ground, the defendant simply turned away and ignored him.’

The riot squad officer, who is part of
Scotland Yard’s Territorial Support Group, failed to alert anyone or 
make a note of the incident.

Tomlinson was helped to his feet by 
two bystanders, but he collapsed and died minutes later after staggering
only 70 yards away from police lines.

The alleged assault might never have come to light but for an  American tourist who captured it on film.

An initial post-mortem examination suggested Mr Tomlinson had died of a heart attack, despite his ‘unusual’ leg injuries.

But after the tourist’s video footage 
was released, two subsequent examinations found abdominal bleeding 
caused by trauma to be the cause of death.

Mr Dennis said: ‘Tomlinson was not posing any threat to the defendant or any other officers.

‘He was displaying no aggression towards anyone nor even making provocative comments towards anyone.’

Harwood denies manslaughter, claiming that his actions were ‘necessary, proportionate and reasonable’ in the circumstances.

The trial continues.
