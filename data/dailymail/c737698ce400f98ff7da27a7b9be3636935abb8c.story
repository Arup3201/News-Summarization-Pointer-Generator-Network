Finding maternity cover can be a complete nightmare.

You want someone who is capable...but who won't try and pinch your job while you're away.

So pregnant presenter Fearne Cotton, 31, has plumped for a trustworthy friend to cover her AW12 modelling gig for very.co.uk in her absence - Leah Weller, 21, daughter of Modfather Paul.

Leah Weller, 21, modelling printed peplum and mini-dresses for Fearne Cotton's new collection.

Cotton - who is expecting a baby with her fiancee Jesse Wood, son of Rolling Stone Ronnie - has a very personal connection to the mid-season collection: she designed it herself.

The Radio One DJ said: 'I absolutely love Leah's look. She is really beautiful yet there is something quirky and interesting about her which I find quite mesmerising.'

Posing in a set of printed peplum dresses, photographic prints, metallic shifts, tunics, lace shift dresses, pencil dresses and block colour mini-dresses, 21-year-old model Wood looks right at home.

The new collection, available now, is Fearne's ninth for online retailer Very.  Prices range from £29 to £89 and sizes range from 8 to 20.
