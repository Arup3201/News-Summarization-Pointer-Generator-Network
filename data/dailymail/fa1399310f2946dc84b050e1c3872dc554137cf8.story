Charged: Concepcion Rodriguez left her 15-month-old sun in a baking hot SUV and he died

A mother has been arrested after she left her 15-month-old baby son in the back of her SUV and he boiled alive in 140F heat.

Concepcion Rodriguez, 26, unloaded six other children from the motor when she arrived home from a store on Wednesday afternoon but forgot the Benny Jnr.

He perished in a baby seat on the driveway outside their home in Corpus Christi, Texas, as outside temperatures reached 100F - making the heat inside the vehicle 140F.

Mrs Rodriguez only remembered about the child when her husband, 30, returned from work three hours later and asked where he was.

The found Benny unresponsive and rang an ambulance. Paramedics battled to revive the toddler but he was pronounce dead.

Police said that they had arrested Mrs Rodriguez and she has since been charged with injury to a child.

Family friend Cornelio Reyna paid tribute to the youngster as a 'very happy kid' and 'always playing with mommy and daddy'.

'I don't know how something like this could've happened, I really don't know,' she told Kris TV.

Neighbour Robert Mendoza said: 'Oh my God, oh my God it hurts my heart. You know I got little ones too. I got grandkids and I feel very sorry for them, very sorry for them.'

Friend Melinda Moore said the tragedy was 'terrible'.

'I just can't imagine that we're hearing this all the time and to have it just three houses down the street, I don't understand how it happens,' she added.

Police said the women had seven children all under eight years old in the SUV on Wednesday afternoon. She unloaded them at 1pm but forgot about the 15-month-old.

A Corpus Christi Police spokesman 
said: 'The child’s mother Concepcion Rodriguez was arrested and charged 
with Injury to a Child, a 2nd Degree Felony punishable by up to 20 years
in prison and a $10,000 fine.

'We
urge parents and child caregivers to prevent hyperthermia in a few ways
to avoid heat related injuries or death. Never leave a child alone in a
vehicle and consistently leave all unattended vehicles locked.

'Create reminders and habits such as leave a purse, cell phone, or item you need at your next stop near the child. '

The death is the latest in a series of tragedies that have seen children die from hyperthermia in intense heat.

Four have been killed in Texas so far this year and 15 have died across the U.S., according to Golden Gat Weather Services.

Kids and Cars spokesman Amber Rollins told the Houston Chronicle: 'I think one of the most important points in that it can happen to anybody … It's heartbreaking.

'The death of a child is one of the most horrid things you can think of, and it's worse when the parent is responsible.'
