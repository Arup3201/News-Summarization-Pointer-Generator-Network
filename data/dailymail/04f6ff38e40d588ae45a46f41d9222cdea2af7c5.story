Outside a makeshift tent built from cardboard and rusting metal, a family do their best to keep warm as they huddle around a small fire.

The child's father is a rag picker, scavenging what he can from refuse, and then trying to sell it.

Meanwhile, a young boy stirs from his slumber in a rubbish-strewn outdoor shelter - the thick red bedding and corrugated iron 'wall' doing little to protect him from the elements.

Heartbreaking scenes such as these played out across much of northern India this week as the region is gripped by sub-zero temperatures.

The rag picker and his young children are one of thousands of families struggling to survive another harsh winter in a slum in Srinagar, Kashmir, as the mercury fell to -2C last night. Earlier this week, the night-time temperature dropped to -12C.

And the boy in the bed is among the countless homeless people in Delhi forced to live outdoors.

The temperature in Delhi managed just 2.4C on December 30 - making it the coldest December there in 17 years, according to Times of India.

This was about five degrees below the average for this time of year.

Living in abject poverty and with scant drainage or sanitation facilities, the slum dwellers of Srinagar find it hard to survive at the best of times.

Their 'homes' are often made from whatever materials they can find: cardboard, tin or torn tarpaulins.

To make matters worse, many of the city's shanty towns are near to Dal Lake, a popular destination for tourists - and a constant reminder of the gaping chasm between the haves and the have-nots.

Despite the situation, the government has done little to help improve their lot.

There are around 65million slum dwellers in India, with 1.7million of them living in Delhi.
