Under-fire MP Maria Miller has bought a countryside Tudor barn worth £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made from the sale of her taxpayer funded home.

The Culture Secretary's new 
16th-century home comprises of a main barn with four bedrooms, three reception
 rooms and a study, with an annexe barn with another bedroom and living
 area.

The Grade II-listed property is set in
1.6 acres of private gardens, has a large cart shed and a range of outbuildings 
including a summer house.

Mrs Miller was ordered to pay back just £5,800 pounds after overclaiming £45,000 pounds in expenses for mortgage interest payments and council tax on the south London property where her parents lived, while designating her main home as a rented property in Basingstoke.

Under-fire MP Maria Miller has bought a countryside Tudor barn worth £1.2million - almost exactly the profit she made from the sale of her taxpayer funded home.

The Parliamentary Standards committee heard Mrs Miller, who has three children, bought her three-bedroom London property for £237,500 pounds in 1996 with a 90 per cent mortgage. Having extensively renovated the house, it was then remortgaged to a value of £575,000 pounds. She later sold the home for £1.47million pounds

Former Conservative chairman Lord Tebbit has become the most senior Conservative to call for Mrs Miller to resign as Culture Secretary, amid controversy over her response to an investigation into her expenses claims.

Lord Tebbit said that the Culture Secretary's 'arrogant' handling of the scandal had revived voter anger over MPs' expenses and undermined the Government's message that 'we're all in it together', adding: 'The best way out of this is for Mrs Miller to resign.'

His call came as Labour promised to reform Parliament's standards system in the wake of controversy over the decision of a panel of MPs to overrule a watchdog's judgment on Mrs Miller.

Pressure on the embattled Mrs Miller has also been ramped up by a poll suggesting a large majority of voters think she should be dropped from the Cabinet, stripped of her responsibility for press regulation and thrown out of the House of Commons.

It comes after her apology in Parliament which lasted just 32 seconds.

A Survation poll for the Mail on Sunday found that almost three-quarters of voters (73 per cent) thought her 32-second apology was inadequate, and similar numbers (75 per cent ) felt David Cameron was wrong to offer her his support.

Mr Cameron has twice publicly voiced his support for the Culture Secretary, but yesterday omitted her from a list of several Cabinet ministers who he singled out for praise in a speech to the Conservative Spring Forum.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggested that she was suffering a backlash for being the minister responsible for the same-sex marriage Bill, which was deeply unpopular with many grassroots Tories.

Speaking on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Duncan Smith said: 'I think she has done a very good job in a very difficult set of circumstances, with the Leveson Inquiry, which has stirred up a lot of media antipathy to her. And also the gay marriage stuff - there's a lot of Conservatives out there who perhaps weren't necessarily supportive, who also feel rather bitter about that.'

Asked if she should rethink her position, he replied: 'No, I don't think so.'

And he warned: 'My view generally is that I'm supportive of Maria, because if we are not careful we end up with a witch-hunt of somebody.'

A member of staff at Savills estate agency, which sold it, said: 'It was sold at the beginning of March, it went quite quickly in the end.'

The firm's website shows the property as being under offer at £1.2million pounds, with a note stating it may have been sold or removed from the market.

The impressive home is described as having: 'A classic 'A' framed oak structure, believed to date back to the 15th or 16th centuries.

'Much of the oak timber was originally reclaimed from older structures some as far back as the 12th century. The barn was sympathetically restored following gales in 1984.'

The Parliamentary Standards committee heard Mrs Miller, who has three children, bought her three-bedroom London property for £237,500 pounds in 1996 with a 90 per cent mortgage.

'I
 wish to make a personal statement in relation to today’s report. The 
report resulted from an allegation made by the Member for Bassetlaw.

'The
 committee has dismissed his allegation. The committee has recommended 
that I apologise to the House for my attitude to the Commissioner’s 
inquiries, and I of course unreservedly apologise.

'I fully accept the recommendations of  the committee, and thank them for bringing this matter to an end.'

Mrs Miller said she spent the majority of her time in her constituency home, but tended to spend three nights per week at her London home when the Commons was sitting.

The committee ruled that she should have made a formal arrangement to reduce her mortgage claims in 2008 when the base rate dropped, so her parents, who lived with her, were not benefiting from expenses claims.

It found that her parents' living costs were not being paid by the taxpayer and cleared her of making false expenses claims, but said her submission of 'incomplete' evidence to the inquiry had breached the MPs' code of conduct.

The Department for Media, Culture and Sport's Twitter feed was hacked on Saturday, with the rogue poster tweeting: '@Maria-MillerMP is like a modern day Robin Hood, she robs the poor to help the rich' and 'Seriously though guys, which one of us hasn't embezzled and cheated the taxpayer?'

Mrs Miller could not be reached for a comment.

Miller bought her house in Wimbledon, south-west London, for £234,000 in 1995

Many
 of the questions raised over Maria Miller’s expenses claims centred on 
the Wimbledon property that she designated as her second home.

Critics
 felt that because her parents  lived in the house, it should be 
designated as her main residence – not the rented  cottage in her 
Hampshire constituency.

The
 Culture Secretary bought the property with her solicitor husband Iain 
for  just £234,000 in 1995 – while she still  worked as an executive for
 London agency Grey Advertising.

Taxpayers
 were billed for the interest on the mortgage for four years from 2005 –
 the year Mrs Miller became MP for Basingstoke – because she designated 
it as her second home.

The couple made more than £1.2million on the property when it was sold in February for £1.47million.

Mrs
 Miller, a 50-year-old mother of three, was appointed Culture Secretary 
and  minister for women and equality in a 2012 Cabinet reshuffle.

@highlight

She had designated a house in South London as her 'second home'

@highlight

It allowed 
her to claim mortgage interest payments from the taxpayer

@highlight

But the report said the property appeared to be her main residence

@highlight

She has since sold the house in Wimbledon for £1.47million

Miller has today faced calls to resign but has been backed by Cameron
