A man has been charged over the death of a police officer who was killed in a suspected hit-and-run collision, the Metropolitan Police has said.

Gary Bromige, aged 25, from South Norwood in South London, will appear at South Western Magistrates' Court, Battersea, south London, today charged with causing death by dangerous driving and failing to stop at the scene of an accident.

PC Andrew Duncan, 47, was pronounced dead in hospital yesterday, less than 36 hours after the hit-and-run crash.

The long-serving Met officer and 
married father-of-two was injured as he operated a speed trap with a 
colleague in a residential area of Sutton, South London, in the early 
hours of Friday.

He was critically injured as he attempted to stop a fast-moving VW Golf by signalling for the driver to pull over.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe led the tributes: 'Andy was a hard working and courageous policeman. He served the community as both a police officer and as a Scouting volunteer.

'The night he was injured, he was doing a job that he loved and we all had every right to expect he would return safely to his home and family - tragically that was not the case.'

Mayor of London Boris Johnson added to tributes to the officer, who served as a beat officer and with riot squads before joining the traffic unit ten years ago.

‘His death is a tragedy and a reminder of the courage and sacrifice shown daily by the men and women who keep London safe,’ he said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said she sent her ‘deepest condolences’.

PC Duncan joined the Metropolitan Police in 1990 and was originally posted to Battersea.

He transferred to the south west territorial support group six years later before moving to Hammersmith and Fulham Borough after seven years' service.

Sir Bernard, who is Britain's most senior police officer, added: 'On behalf of the Metropolitan Police family, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to his wife and children, parents, family and friends.

'We will continue to professionally and objectively investigate this incident under the oversight of Her Majesty's Coroner.

'I would urge anyone with information to contact us.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 020 8941 9011.
