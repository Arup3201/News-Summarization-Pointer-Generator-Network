Lord Thomas, the Lord Chief Justice, has backed Home Secretary Theresa May's campaign to tighten deportation laws

The Government drive to tighten laws on the deportation of criminals and illegal immigrants was backed by the Lord Chief Justice yesterday.

Lord Thomas said ministers were ‘quite right’ to be looking at abuses of the judicial review system by immigration lawyers.

And he wished success to the efforts by Home Secretary Theresa May to stop criminals and illegal migrants from using the right to family life to persuade judges that they should not be thrown out of the country.

Lord Thomas made his views known at a time when Mrs May and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling are both engaged in efforts to limit the use of what they see as loopholes in the laws.

The new Lord Chief Justice may have to take major court decisions in the most controversial areas of immigration law over the coming months.

He has already denounced the way immigration lawyers frequently make last-minute applications to overturn deportation decisions on grounds which some think spurious.

Last year he spoke out in the case of a Bangladeshi student whose lawyers made two last-minute applications to keep him in the country on the eve of his deportation.

He said that the procedure was ‘an intolerable waste of public money’, an abuse of the courts, and ‘totally without merit’.

Lawyers who acted in the same way in the future would face ‘vigorous action’, he warned.

Yesterday Lord Thomas said that judicial review has been ‘a huge success story’ over the past four decades.

But he added: ‘It is realistic to say that sometimes people do bring judicial review proceedings which are wholly unmerited.

‘I, during the course of the summer, 
sat on a number of cases arising out of the use of it to delay 
immigration deportations, and I gave a number of judgments on which I do
not wish to add.

‘So there are areas of the system where there is abuse, and the Government is quite right to be looking at it.’

Theresa May has been campaigning for 18 months to regulate the use of Article Eight of the European Convention which grants the right to a family life, and has been used by immigrants to remain in the UK

Lord Thomas also said he wanted Mrs May to win her battle to limit the way Article Eight of the European human rights charter, which sets out the right to a family life, is used by judges to prevent foreign criminals and illegal immigrants from being deported.

The Home Secretary has spent 18 months trying to set down rules which mean that judges do not allow criminals or illegal migrants to stay in the country on the thinnest of claims that they have a family life in Britain.

Some judges ignored a Parliamentary vote to tighten the rules, so full legislation saying ‘little weight’ should be given in court to claims of a newly-established family life are included in the Government’s Immigration Bill, now going through Parliament.

Among successful claims have been those of a Nepalese man guilty of manslaughter who stayed in Britain even though he had no partner, no children and lived with his parents.

In another notorious case, a judge allowed a visa overstayer to remain in the country after hearing that he had a pet cat.

Lord Thomas said: ‘In relation to Article Eight and immigration, I think the Government has taken a course which is interesting and I hope will be successful, which is namely to legislate setting criteria by which the courts should proceed.

‘I cannot comment on that at all, because obviously the way the criteria are to be applied, and the compatibility of the criteria for Article Eight, will be something that may come up in future court cases.’
