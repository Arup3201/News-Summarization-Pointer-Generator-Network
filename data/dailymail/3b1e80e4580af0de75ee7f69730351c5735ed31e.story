When they found her, starving to death and desperately weak, she was half the horse she should have been.

Polly the abandoned bay mare was so underweight she had zero body fat, her ribs poked through and her rescuers described her as the thinnest living horse they had ever seen.

But after six months of constant care, she has made a miraculous recovery, is a picture of health and back to a weight close to what she should be.

The five-year-old was found in a corn field backing on to the M25 in Chalfont St Peter, Buckinghamshire, on a cold day in February by the RSPCA and taken to the nearby Horse Trust charity’s centre in Speen.

Another mare dumped in the same field with Polly had collapsed in the mud and was unable to stand.

Nothing could be done for her and a vet put her to sleep to prevent further suffering. A third with a seriously injured hind leg was put down a week later.

All three were equally emaciated. Polly, who also had worms, conjunctivitis and the skin disease rainscald, weighed 316kg (696lb), almost less than half the healthy weight for a horse of her size, 15 hands.

Jeanette Allen, chief executive of the Horse Trust, said: ‘It’s a miracle Polly is still alive. It’s the worst case of horse neglect I’ve ever seen.

‘We rate a horse’s weight on a scale from zero to five, with three being a healthy horse. Polly was a zero - she had no fat on her skin or even around her vital organs.’

Polly now weighs a near normal half a ton (466kg/1027lb) after putting on a much-needed 150kg (331lb).

But her road to recovery was a long one, and far from simple. She could not be fed with a lot of food for fear of her dying from ‘re-feeding syndrome’.

This meant that she had to have controlled amounts of hay a day to avoid being overloaded with calories and her body shutting down. Her lack of body fat also meant that the treatment she needed for worms could have proved fatal as well.

Mrs Allen said: ‘When we first started treatment it could have proved toxic for her. It was a horrible Catch 22 situation where we had to treat her worms to stop them killing her but the treatment itself could have caused fatal damage.

‘The treatment is absorbed by fat cells and released slowly over a few months, but she had no fat and it would have just swamped her body.’

All three horses were microchipped, but their details only link back to their veterinary clinic, not their owner, making it unlikely they will ever be traced and prosecuted for neglect.

Rescue centres reported a rise in admissions of up to 40 per cent last year, with increasing numbers of horses being abandoned because of the effect of the credit crunch on the price of feed.

Unscrupulous dealers, hit by a slump in demand following the horse meat scandal, were also blamed for the surge.

Polly is now well enough to have been released into a field at the centre with other rescued horses.

Mrs Allen said: ‘She’s a real mare now, the transformation is unbelievable.

'She’s got a group of male horses who follow her everywhere - it’s a right little fan club.

‘When we first got her we would never have imagined putting her in with other horses. She could barely have survived the slightest brush.’
