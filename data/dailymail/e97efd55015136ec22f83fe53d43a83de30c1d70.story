George Osborne today insisted that Britain was recovering from the after-effects of the recession - and he seems to have bounced back from his own personal recession too.

Observers noted that the Chancellor's hair appeared thicker than on Budget day last year, with his bald spot less obvious than it previously was.

The 42-year-old is also said to have slimmed down over the past year after taking up the '5:2 Diet', cutting his calorie intake to just 500 on two days of the week.

Mr Osborne delivered a relentlessly upbeat message during today's Budget, as he announced a series of giveaways to voters a year before the next general election.

However, some people were more focussed on the Chancellor's appearance than his message, pointing out the visible transformation he has undergone in recent months.

Rich Morgan tweeted: 'What's going on with George Osborne's hair, it kind of looks like he's doing a big old comb-forward.'

Nicola Borasinski added: 'George Osborne's hair is fooling no-one. Definitely a dye job, possibly even a toupee.'

Diet: Mr Osborne adopted a new diet and fitness regime in a bid to shed the pounds

One website speculated that Mr Osborne could have started dying his hair or even undergone a hair transplant.

However, others suggested that he had simply mastered the favourite trick of many middle-aged men and managed to comb his hair to make it appear thicker in strategic places.

Last year he radically changed his hairstyle, adopting a 'layered' look which was widely thought to be an attempt to look younger.

Mr Osborne is also believed to have lost several pounds since adopting the 5:2 Diet, which involves two days of 'fasting' every week.

On the popular diet, which has also 
been taken up by Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, followers 'fast' for two 
non-consecutive days, and eat normally for the remaining five.

After six weeks, they can lose up to a stone, it is claimed.

Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is said to be experimenting with alternatives to dairy, and Education Secretary Michael Gove has shifted two stone at a Â£2,500 'fat farm' retreat in Austria.

But the Chancellor's personal austerity was not matched by his announcements in today's Budget, when he cut the price of beer and lowered the tax on bingo.
