Despite her hot-blooded ways, she is thought of as one of literature’s very British characters.And she has certainly been portrayed on TV as an English rose.But Lady Chatterley was in fact Italian, a new book claims – or at least the character that inspired her was

DH 
Lawrence’s provocative Connie, who beds her aristocratic husband’s 
gamekeeper, was based on his publisher’s Italian wife, according to 
Richard Owen in his book Lady Chatterley’s Villa.

Lawrence had 
already used Rina Secker, as the muse for Juliet in his short story Sun,
 in which a young woman holidaying alone in Italy experiences erotic 
fantasies about a local peasant farmer.

But Owen says that Lawrence’s
 German wife Frieda caused a stir when she declared at a London party: 
‘Rina my dear, Lady Chatterley is you.’

She even proposed that Mrs 
Secker, wife of publisher Martin Secker, should play Lady Chatterley in 
the movie version – a role taken on TV in 1993 by Joely Richardson and 
on film in 1981 by Sylvia Kristel.

Mrs Secker, when Lawrence knew 
her, was an attractive and flirtatious young mother who, like Connie, 
suffered from mood swings and discontentment and was growing 
increasingly estranged from her husband.

For long periods of the 
Seckers’ marriage, she lived apart from him on the Italian Riviera and 
was rumoured to be having several affairs, including one with her 
driver.

Two years before Lady Chatterley’s Lover was published, she 
spent six months with Lawrence and Frieda in Spotorno, where her father 
owned a hotel, as the writer recovered from tuberculosis.

Lawrence was 
inspired by her, Owen claims, perceiving the growing unhappiness in her 
marriage and the reason for it.

While suffering from nervous exhaustion,
 involving headaches, anxiety attacks and depression, says Owen, the 
publisher’s wife was also ‘vibrant, observant, mischievous, flirtatious 
and coquettishly aware of her charms’.

He adds: ‘This is strikingly 
similar to Lawrence’s description of the “feminine” and “womanly” Connie
 Chatterley, with the “growing restlessness” and sense of “disconnexion”
 which drives her into the arms of gamekeeper Mellors.’

Mrs Secker’s relationship with her husband is reflected in Connie’s feelings about her husband Sir Clifford, Owen says.

He
 told the Daily Mail: ‘Lawrence was very perceptive and used people he 
met all the time in his fiction. There is no evidence that he used Rina 
for the sex scenes in Lady Chatterley but her character contributed to 
it.’

As the book acknowledges, Lawrence also drew inspiration from 
his wife’s affair with a handsome Italian officer named Angelo Ravagli, 
whom they met through Mrs Secker.

The controversial, sexually 
explicit novel was censored in Britain from its 1928 publication  until 
1960, when following an obscenity trial the use of four-letter words in 
literature was finally approved.
