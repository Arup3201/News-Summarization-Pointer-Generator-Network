More than a hundred redheads have taken part in the UK's first Ginger Pride march today.

The parade wound its way through Edinburgh city centre to demonstrate against prejudice or discrimination to people with red hair - known as 'gingerism'.

Marchers held aloft signs carrying 
messages such as 'For the love of ginger', 'All hail! The red, orange 
and pale' as well as 'Ginger and proud'.

The march was the brainchild of Canadian comic Shawn Hitchins who said he is hoping it can become an annual event.

Together: The march was against 'gingerism', which has been described as prejudice or discrimination against people with red hair

He said: 'Being ginger plays into your identity and we are all one big ginger family.

'Internationally, red hair is tied to the identity of Scotland and should be cause for celebration.

'There are not many redheads in Canada 
and I wanted to be around a large group of gingers for once. I just put 
the idea out there and now hundreds of people showed up.

He added: 'This is the first year and 
we’re starting small and if all goes well I would love for this event to
become an annual celebration in one of my favourite cities.

'I think its just the start and there is a possibility to create a larger march in the future.

'It’s totally tongue-in-cheek, but in 
light of the recent attention to bullying and gingerism we can send a 
message to all that says, it gets redder.'

Noisy: Organisers say the march created an 'amazing' atmosphere as it wound its way through Edinburgh

Proud: Obby Stephenson, from Kilmarnock, and dog Tilley ,2, also took part in the unique event

'I believe we truly sent a message to the world of how proud we are to be ginger. It was a special moment for gingers everywhere. All hail the red, orange and pale.'

Songwriter Caroline England, 35, and her daughter Taran, 4, travelled from Liverpool to take part in the march.

Mrs England said: 'Our hair colour is beautiful. I have even written a song called "Ginger" which is about having this distinctive look and being proud of 
it. It's a funny take on having red hair.

'There are many people who think it's alright to be mean towards people with red hair, but we are proud of who we are.'

Nicola
Goodall, 42, from Edinburgh has four naturally ginger children. She was accompanied at the event by Ali, 8, Naima, 9, and Zanab,11.

Happy: Jacob Smart 2, also joined in the fun by talking to Pc Stephen Skirving

She said: 'Me and my husband used to be ginger and all our children have natural red hair, so there is six of us in the house, but it's unusual for us to see so many people with red hair.

'We all have freckles and and red hair on our arms. My daughter Shaheeda wasn't able to come today.

'She's got amazing hair and even works as a hair model, but she recently had to colour it and now it's purple.'

Scott Ronald, 43, said: 'When
I was a child, there was always people teasing and calling me names, 
but now things have changed and I think everyone wants to be a redhead.

'I think the stigma surrounding gingers 
has gone and it's actually become fashionable to have red hair. These 
days you can even see a lot of girls colouring their hair red.'

Happy: Canadian comic Shawn Hitchins holds an image of ginger icon Prince Harry.  Fiona Wallace, 37, from Edinburgh, displayed this banner as she marched through the Scottish city

Speaking out: As well as singing chants, the marchers also displayed a variety of banners

Red hair occurs naturally in 
approximately one to two per cent of the world population, but Scotland 
has the highest proportion of redheads with 13 per cent accounting for 
650,000 gingers north of the border.

Red
hair can vary from a deep burgundy through burnt orange to bright 
copper. It is characterised by high levels of the reddish pigment 
pheomelanin and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.

The term 'redhead' has been in use 
since at least 1510 and is commonly associated with fair skin, lighter 
eye colours, freckles, and sensitivity to ultraviolet light.

Cultural
reactions have varied from ridicule to admiration and many common 
stereotypes exist regarding redheads, as they are often portrayed as 
fiery-tempered.

Mr Hitchins is performing a show
inspired by his hair colour called Ginger Nation at this year's 
Edinburgh PBH's Free Fringe.
