Finding a meal big enough to feed a pack of hungry lions and their cubs is usually a difficult task.

But there were no empty stomachs among this pride in Kenya's Masai Mara after they managed to hunt down an adult male giraffe.

At least four lionesses and three cubs were pictured feasting on the unusual kill for days.

Dinner time: A pride of lions swarm over their unusual kill - an adult male giraffe

Feeding frenzy: At least three cubs and four lionesses fed on the giraffe for a number of days

Fresh meat: Giraffes are not usually prey for lions due to their size and the fact they have a vicious kick

It is believed the giraffe was either ill or wounded, otherwise it would be extremely difficult for lions to take down an animal which weighs on average 1,600kg and can stand up to 20ft tall.

British
wildlife photographer and safari guide Paul Goldstein, who had been following the pride for months, said he was kept 
awake most of the night from the noise of the lions killing then 
fighting over the prey.

Paul, from Wimbledon, said: 'This was an adult bull giraffe, it must have been sick or wounded otherwise this particular pride, which I have spent many months with, would never have taken him down.

'However it proved a huge larder for many days and, as it was quite cool, the meat did not go off too quickly.Â 

Fresh meat: Wet and cold weather meant the kill kept the lions fed for several days

In for the kill: Photographer Paul Goldstein said he heard the lions killing and fighting for their prey during the night

In the wild: One of the lion cubs shakes himself dry as rain threatens to spoil the pride's meal time

'Watching the hierarchy on the dinner table was fascinating although with such a large feast the elders were not as robust as they normally are with the cubs.'

Giraffes are not easy prey for lions because of their height which makes them difficult to bring down.

Lions kill by grasping the throat of their prey and suffocating it, and they cannot easily reach the throat of a giraffe whilst it is standing up.

However, by working together lions can hunt and kill adult giraffes. They will often chase them onto rocky ground, where they cannot keep their balance easily, hoping to trip them up.

At other times they simply surround the giraffe and repeatedly attack it as a group until it falls, when they can seize its throat.

Giraffes also have a very powerful kick that can kill a lion so lions prefer to hunt easier prey such as antelope and zebra.
