Anti-Semitic graffiti has appeared on synagogues and the property of Jewish families in a worrying increase in hate attacks amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Swastikas and the word 'Hamas' were found spray-painted on the entrance of the Torah V'Emunah Congregation synagogue in Miami, Florida today.

On Saturday, a family in Miami Beach found their two cars with the words 'Jew' and 'Hamas' smeared in cream cheese and pelted with eggs.

Josh and Rachel, who did not want to use their last name, told NBC that they did not believe they were singled out but picked because their cars are the first on the block and have a Miami Beach Jewish Community Center sticker.

Rachel said: 'It's not necessarily terrorism, but it's like a hate crime. It's clearly racism right here and we thought this is America. It shouldn't be happening to us, but it does.'

No one has been arrested so far over the hate crimes.

There has been scattered attacks across north America since the ceasefire between Israel and Gaza broke down earlier this month.

The 20-day war has killed more than 1,060 Palestinians, mainly civilians, according to Palestinian health officials.

Israel has lost 43 soldiers, while two Israeli civilians and a Thai worker in Israel were killed by rocket and mortar attacks from Gaza.

The Anti-Defamation League reported earlier this month that dozens of anti-Israel demonstrations had taken place across the U.S., including one in Los Angeles where Jewish activists were attacked by pro-Palestine supporters. There were no major injuries.

Anti-Semitic attacks are also on the rise across Europe. More than 100 hate crimes have been recorded by police and community groups this month in the UK, more than double the usual number.

Protesters in France, which has the world’s third largest Jewish population, have attacked synagogues, smashed the windows of Jewish-owned businesses and set others on fire.

In Germany an Imam reportedly called on Muslims to murder ‘Zionist Jews’ and Jewish people have been attacked in the street.

In the Greek capital Athens, the Holocaust Memorial was scrawled with death threats against Jews.

Smoke rises after an Israeli airstrike in the east of Gaza City today. Anti-Semitic attacks have increased across the U.S. following the beginning of the conflict earlier this month
