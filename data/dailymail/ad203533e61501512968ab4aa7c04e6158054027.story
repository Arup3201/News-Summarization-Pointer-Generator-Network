With Polaroid cameras facing a resurgence, especially among celebrities and the privacy conscious, Prynt’s phone case could not be launching at a more opportune time.

The case turns digital images into physical photos at the touch of a button, without the need for a data connection.

And the French firm is working on an augmented reality feature that will also play videos around printed shots.

The Prynt is set to launch on Kickstarter early next year, and will cost $99 (£63). It will initially support 4-inch screens, but larger models will be released later. The prototype can only hold one piece of paper and takes 50 seconds to print but the firm claims its final version is expected to take 30 seconds and hold up to 30 sheets

Prynt has been designed by a French startup with the same name, led by Clement Perrot.

Mr Perrot’s prototype version currently holds just one piece of paper and takes 50 seconds to print a photo.

The photos are sent to the case using Bluetooth, which then prints them in a similar way to how traditional Polaroid cameras work, by mixing a reagent material with chemicals in the layers to form the final image.

The firm has said this final version will print images in around 30 seconds, and will be able to hold up to 30 sheets of paper.

The photos are sent to the case using Bluetooth, which then prints out the image in a similar way to how traditional Polaroid cameras work. When a photo is taken using Prynt, the app records seconds either side to capture a video. Holding up the photo to the camera, with the app open, plays the video on the screen

Sales of Polaroid cameras (pictured), which were particularly popular in the 1980s, have risen by around three quarters in the past year. The popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey

It will initially support 4-inch screens, such as those seen on the iPhone 5S and 5C, but larger models will be released later.

Instant camera film features layers of colours of light.

These layers sit on top of a black base layer and beneath an image, timing and acid layer.

When the shot is taken, a small amount of reagent material is rolled onto the film sheet, which reacts with chemicals in the film.

These chemicals move downward through the layers, dissolving the developer dye so it moves towards the image layer.

Metallic silver areas on each layer, which were exposed to light when the photo was taken, capture the dye so it is distributed throughout the photo, to match the colours of the scene photographed.

The acid layer in the film reacts with the alkali and opacifiers in the reagent, making the opacifiers become clear, and this is what makes the image appear.

An extra feature, which Mr Perrot revealed to Kyle Russell at TechCrunch is an augmented reality tool, built into an app.

Holding up the photo to the phone’s camera, with the app open, plays the video on the screen.

Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s,  have risen by around three quarters in the past year.

Kaley Cuoco, who stars in The Big Bang Theory recently declared: ‘Polaroids are the way to go.

'No one can get those.’

Her comments were made following a recent spate of iCloud leaks, which saw private photos of more than 100 celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, leaked online.

The popularity of the retro camera has also been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey.

A Polaroid photo, for example, forms the front cover of Taylor Swift’s new album, 1989, making the format fashionable again.
