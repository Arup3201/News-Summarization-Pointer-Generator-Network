If you like to drive fast you may want to avoid a village in Ohio where more than 6,000 drivers are caught speeding each month.

Nearly $1.5 million worth of fines have been issued to motorists since two traffic cameras were installed in Elmwood Place, near Cincinnati, last September.

But a judge ruled yesterday that the devices, which issue 6,600 fines a month - at $105 each - violated drivers' constitutional rights.

Complaints: Two speed cameras installed in Elmwood Place, Ohio, (pictured) have been issuing fines at a rate of 6,600 a month, or three times the number of people who live in the village

Ruling: Judge Robert Ruehlman has ruled that the fines violate the constitutional rights of drivers who he said are unable to effectively appeal against them

Village officials first approved the speed cameras last July. The firm controlling the cameras gets 40 per cent of the revenue, while the rest goes to the village.

But opponents of the cameras - which issue 'civil penalties' and do not add points to driver's licences - said they were just a money making scheme, and launched a legal challenge against them.

And their campaign appears to have paid off, after a judge ruled yesterday that the devices 'violate drivers' rights under the state constitution.'

Hamilton County Judge Robert Ruehlman's 
said the cameras violated 'due 
process guarantees' under the Ohio Constitution, Fox News reports.

Victory: Attorney Mike Allen - who represented opponents in their legal fight against the fines - said the ruling is the first of its kind in the US

He said hearings held for drivers to contest the fines, are 'nothing more than a sham' as they would effectively be arguing against a written report 'produced by the company that owns the speed monitoring unit.'

Attorney Mike Allen,
whose firm brought the case, said this is the first time such a ruling has been made on speed cameras in the US.

Up to 18,000 vehicles a 
day pass through the village, police said. The cameras' supporters claimed they are effective helping cut speeding in the area.

Local police chief William Peskin said last year that the cameras have been installed in the interests of public safety.

A spokesman for Optotraffic, the firm which owns and operates the speed cameras, told ABC News in January that the devices are an 'efficient and accurate way to control speed.'
