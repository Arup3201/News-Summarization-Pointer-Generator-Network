A toddler has died after he was mauled by two pit bulls in south-eastern Wisconsin.

The 14-month-old, who has not been named, died nearly three hours after the attack. It is believed he was being looked after by a babysitter.

The babysitter and dog owner, identified as 30-year-old Susan Iwicki, was also injured in the attack at her house in Walworth.

Walworth County Sheriff's department said they received a 911 call from Ms Iwicki at 12.46pm yesterday to say she and the boy were being attacked by the pit bulls.

The toddler was taken to 
Mercy-Walworth Medical Center before being airlifted to the Children's Hospital of 
Wisconsin where he died from critical injuries at about 3:30pm.

The dogs were removed from the house and euthanized by a local vet.

Friends of the boy's family told WISN 12 News described how his parents had spent a long time trying for a baby.

Dario Newell said: '(It's) just unbelievable. (I'm) at a loss for words.

'They're both beautiful parents and tried hard for a long time to have this baby, and now it just got taken away.'

Emily Dueschen, a friend of the child's father, said: 'I just want (the child's father) to know that I love him, and that we're all here to support him in whatever he needs. We're all here for him.'

Another friend of the father, Nicole Jennison, told the station: 'When he was with his kid, it was just all smiles.

'He didnâ€™t care about anything else in the world, and now this happened. It breaks my heart.'
