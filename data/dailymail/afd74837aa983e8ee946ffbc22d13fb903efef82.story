Holland goalkeeper Tim Krul is ecstatic to be in the semi-finals of the World Cup after his dramatic introduction to the tournament.

The Newcastle star came on late in extra-time and produced two saves in the penalty shoot-out victory against Costa Rica.

'Tonight I have realised a dream,' Krul told www.telegraaf.nl following the quarter-final win. 'What I've experienced is an incredible emotion.

Bold: Louis van Gaal decided to bring Krul on towards the end of extra-time just for the penalties

'(Holland coach Louis) Van Gaal had warned me. It was something prepared and I knew that I would have this chance.'

Van Gaal promised Cillessen - who, unlike Krul, was not told of the planned change for the shoot-out - that he remains his first choice for the semi-final.

'There is no question about who will start next game, it will be Cillessen,' he said. 'But we felt Krul was the better choice here.

'We told Krul that he would be a possibility for the penalties, but we didn't tell Cillessen, as we didn't want to ruin his preparation.'

The Oranje had numerous chances to win the game without the need for spot-kicks but were denied by the woodwork three times as well as by an inspired display from Costa Rica keeper Keylor Navas.

Holland, runners-up four years ago in South Africa, take on Argentina in the last four on Wednesday in Sao Paulo.

'Now we have to think of Argentina,' Krul said. 'It will be a very difficult game.'

Navas lamented his team's elimination from the World Cup but believes they have done their nation proud.

Los Ticos had never reached the quarter-final stages of the competition and had gone unbeaten in Brazil before losing 4-3 on penalties in Salvador.

'We lost everything in a penalty shoot-out and we go home sad but with our heads held high,' Navas said to Costa Rica newspaper CRhoy.com. 'It's hard but this is life.'

Bryan Ruiz and Michael Umana saw their spot-kicks saved by Krul while the Dutch converted all of their attempts.

'We cannot blame anyone because to be there at that time is not easy,' Navas said. 'Our rivals did their job in the penalty shoot -out and we didn't.'
