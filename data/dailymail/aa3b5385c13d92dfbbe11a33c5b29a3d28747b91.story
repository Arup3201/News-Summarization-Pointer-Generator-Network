A driver has miraculously survived after his car spun off a mountain pass and crashed 80 metres down a steep embankment.

The unnamed driver, in his 30s, was behind the wheel of a red Vauxhall Astra when he crashed through a safety barrier on the Horseshoe Pass near Llangollen in Denbighshire, north-east Wales.

His car then plunged approximately 80 metres down a steep embankment where he was left trapped in the crumbled wreckage on Tuesday morning.

Emergency services were called to the scene and managed to cut the man free before flying him to hospital. Astonishingly, he escaped with minor injuries.

Wreckage: Fire crews had to use hydraulic cutting equipment to remove the back of the car and the  seats so they could free the driver

Lucky escape: No other vehicles were involved in the crash and the driver of the red Vauxhall Astra escaped with minor injuries

No other vehicles were involved and the man was the only person in the car.

Fire crews used hydraulic cutting equipment to cut the back of the car and also had to remove seats in order to free the driver.

After the driver was freed he was carried away on a spinal board before being flown to hospital.

Llangollen Fire last night tweeted that the man escaped with 'minor injuries' next to the hashtag '#seatbeltsavelives'.

The incident between the A5104 Llandegla and B5103 Llangollen, saw the road closed in both directions from about 10.30am until early afternoon.

Investigation: It is not yet known what caused the driver to spin off the road on Tuesday morning

North Wales Police spokesman Michael McGivern said the car left the road and came to rest in a field.

Two fire engines from Llangollen and Ruthin, along with the technical rescue unit from Wrexham, were called to the scene at 11.04am.

Crews used cutting equipment and were also required to remove seats from the vehicle in order to free the driver.

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We were called to reports of a single-vehicle road traffic collision on the A542 Horseshoe Pass.

'We sent a crew in an emergency ambulance and a Wales Air Ambulance to the scene, and a man in his 30s was airlifted to Wrexham Maelor Hospital.'
