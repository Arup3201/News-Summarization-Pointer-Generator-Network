Dozens of volunteers are today searching for a missing two-year-old girl while police probe her father’s claim she was taken during a carjacking.

Bianca Jones, 2, of Detroit, Michigan, has been missing since Friday when D'Andre Lane claims she was in his car’s rear seat and taken in a robbery.

But police are questioning the 32-year-old’s story, searched his home and were holding him on an outstanding warrant from an unrelated case.

Where is she? Bianca Jones, 2, of Detroit, has been missing since D'Andre Lane claims she was in his car's rear seat and taken in a robbery on Friday

Makibla Gideon, 39, is on the search team and was stepping among discarded tyres, piles of soggy clothing and nail-pierced wood boards.

She said: 'You have to put all that aside when it comes to a precious little girl. If it was my son or me missing I would want somebody looking for me.’

She looked for a purple toddler's jacket or pink shirt, barely avoiding oily pools of filthy rain water in alleys not far from the alleged carjacking.

Many who canvassed the area in 30F temperatures that gave way to snow returned to Metropolitan United Methodist Church and vowed to try again.

Lane was being held in nearby Oakland County on an outstanding warrant from an unrelated case, but was later released on Monday.

Investigators were questioning his story and searched his home yesterday. No suspects have been identified in relation to the alleged carjacking.

Detroit Police Chief Ralph Godbee said the search for Bianca is of the ‘highest priority’ in relation to ‘dedicated resources’ on the case.

‘The Detroit Police Department will not comment on the quantity nor the quality of any evidence or information we have gathered to date,’ he said.

‘However… the authenticity and credibility of the original version of events is under intense scrutiny by our investigative team.’

'Mr Lane has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter'

Terry Johnson

Lane's lawyer described his client as a ‘loving father’ and said he has been straightforward with police and will be so in the future.

Terry Johnson said Lane ‘has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter’.

The girl's mother Banika Jones said she last saw her daughter on November 26, when family and friends celebrated her birthday.

Ms Jones said Lane had taken Bianca to see a movie, brought her back to her mother's house for the party and then the girl left with her father.

'We love her and we want her home. Bianca, Mommy has lots and lots of gingerbread men for you when you get home'

Banika Jones

‘We love her and we want her home,’ Ms Jones said. ‘Bianca, Mommy has lots and lots of gingerbread men for you when you get home.’

Lane was jailed for more than three years on drug and firearm possession charges stemming from a 2003 arrest and was paroled in 2007.

He served a more than four-year probation starting in 1996 after being convicted of assault with intent to commit armed robbery and conspiracy.

Aged two: Banika Jones said Lane has a good relationship with Bianca, who is described as 2'5" and weighing about 25lbs, with brown eyes and black hair

A pre-sentencing report from 2007 shows Lane, a father of three other children from three other relationships, wanted to shield his incarceration.

'He has unfettered access to her; welcome to come anytime. He's never been anything but loving and committed to her'

Banika Jones

Lane did not want his children to come to see him in prison because he did not think it was a place for them to visit, a probation officer wrote.

Ms Jones said Lane has a good relationship with Bianca, who is described as 2’5” and weighing about 25lbs, with brown eyes and black hair.

‘He has unfettered access to her; welcome to come anytime,’ she said. ‘He's never been anything but loving and committed to her.

Questions: D'Andre Lane's lawyer said he 'has fully cooperated and will continue to cooperate with police agencies to assure the safe return of his daughter'

‘I know he probably wants to see Bianca home as much as I do. I have no information on the investigation. My focus is on finding Bianca.

'They were never officially in a relationship. There was no problem and now Bianca's gone. Let's just find her'

Kelly Jones

‘That is what I'm driven to do right now is bring my daughter home. I just want to see Bianca again. We are going to bring Bianca home.’

Lane has been close to the Jones family for years, said Ms Jones sister Kelly Jones.

‘They were never officially in a relationship,’ she said of Lane and Banika. ‘There was no problem and now Bianca's gone. Let's just find her.’

Investigation: No suspects have been identified in relation to the alleged carjacking but this is a sketch of a subject wanted for the incident last Friday

Locating a child that some fear is somewhere shivering in the cold is what prompted Michelle Carter to join the search on Monday.

'We went through the alleys. We searched porches, under debris, moved bags and went through trash. We called Bianca's name'

Michelle Carter

‘We went through the alleys,' she said. 'We searched porches, under debris, moved bags and went through trash. We called Bianca's name.’

The 39-year-old nail salon owner refused to think the worst and admitted to having no idea what Bianca's mother may be feeling.

‘I don't want to imagine. No,’ Ms Carter said. ‘Being a mother and not even knowing where your child is - I know is devastating.’
