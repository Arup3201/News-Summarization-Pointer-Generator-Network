The new Republican governor of Illinois has said New Jersey is 'going down the drain' - despite it being run by fellow Republican Chris Christie, who sent $7million his way in the latest election campaign.

Bruce Rauner said the Garden State was 'lost', thanks in part to its high property taxes.

Rauner hit out at New Jersey, which has had Christie as governor since 2010, during a speech at the Illinois Farm Bureau last week.

He said: 'We've got the highest property taxes in America other than New Jersey. I don't want to compete with New Jersey on anything, especially that. That's a disaster.'

The State Register-Journal of Springfield, Illinois, reported that he continued: 'New Jersey is lost. They're going down the drain, and they ain't turning it around.' 

The staunch criticism may come as a surprise to Christie, who as the head of the Republican Governors Association funneled $7million in campaign funds to help him topple Democratic incumbent Pat Quinn.

Christie often showed up on the campaign trail alongside Rauner, and boasted that he 'didn't come empty-handed' after making a $2.5million top-up to the coffers.

CBS Chicago reported how during the campaign Rauner and Christie made a public appearance to order jumbo hotdogs together before a hotel fundraiser.

In return, Rauner has often been a vocal Christie fan. NJ.com reports that he has described him as 'one of the greatest public servants in America today' and 'a superstar'.

Rauner spent a total of $37million on TV ads alone in the campaign, in which he outspent Quinn by some $9million, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

The Center's records from the 2014 governor elections show Christie's association sent a total of $7million Rauner's way. 

Spokesmen for Christie and Rauner have yet to comment.
