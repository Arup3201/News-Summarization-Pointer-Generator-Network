A 39-year-old female driver set herself on fire, crashed her car on a bridge and then jumped 40 feet to a park below in an apparent suicide attempt, but managed to survive, Oregon police said Thursday.

The Eugene woman was being treated for critical injuries at a Portland-area hospital.

The woman's family had recently reported her missing, police spokesman John Hankemeier said.

 A 911 caller reported Thursday afternoon that a car appeared to be on fire from the inside, with the woman at the wheel driving recklessly, The Register-Guard newspaper reported.

Scene: A 39-year-old woman apparently set herself on fire intentionally while behind the wheel of this Hyundai, crashed her car on a bridge and then jumped 40 feet to a park below. She is now in a critical condition

After the car crashed into a bridge guardrail, witnesses told police the woman jumped out — while on fire — and began taking her clothes off as she ran to the edge of the span.

Truck drivers tried to put out the flames with fire extinguishers and a female driver who stopped at the scene tried to grab the woman from the edge, but she was still able to jump, police said.

'I am thankful for the witness who helped us piece together what happened and was trying to keep this woman from jumping off a bridge,' traffic Lt. Doug Mozan said. 

Mozan praised the female passer-by who attempted to save the woman. 

'Her efforts were nothing less than heroic,' he said.

When the car crashed, a piece of its bumper sailed over the bridge, injuring a 40-year-old woman below. 

Investigation: Police say they were able to piece together the events that lead to the woman being found in a park below this bridge thanks to accounts from witnesses

The pedestrian was treated for minor injuries, police said.

The car was still engulfed in flames when police arrived, Mozan said.

It appeared an accelerant had been used inside the vehicle. 

The accident damaged the bridge and traffic was backed up for almost two hours.

The fire and crash remain under investigation.

'I believe it was intentionally set on fire but at this point we're still investigating,' Mozan told KVAL-TV. 

'I think according to witnesses she was spreading some sort of propellant but it's hard to say what exactly that was.'
