She’s just won her seventh grand slam and is hoping to secure her eighth major title at Wimbledon but it seems that the poster girl of tennis is already getting excited about starting a family.

Speaking to MailOnline about her future, 27-year-old Maria Sharapova, who is currently dating Bulgarian tennis ace Grigor Dimitrov, said: 'I would like to play tennis for as long as I enjoy playing, but family is really important for me so we’ll see.'

For now, the Russian tennis star, who is ranked world No. 5 by the Women's Tennis Association, is focusing on her performance at Wimbledon.

Tennis ace: Maria Sharapova, 27, is still dominating the world of tennis after just winning the French Open - and she's even landed herself a starring role in Rizzle Kicks' new music video

Speaking about preparing for huge tournaments, she said: 'Every tournament is an opportunity, but 
grand slams require a lot of preparation and hard work.

'I train as much 
as I can and maintain a good diet to keep me fit and healthy, but 
getting in the mindset is important too.

'When you step out onto the 
court, you are fully aware of the spectators around you, so it’s easy to 
channel their energy and enthusiasm to boost your performance. The buzz 
from the crowd is very encouraging.' 

Clearly her training and commitment is paying off, she just won the French 
Open, which she describes as the most recent high point of her career.

High point: Maria says that Wimbledon is the natural home of tennis and is steeped in tradition, so winning there and becoming a part of that tradition was 'truly special'

However, she says that winning her first Grand
 Slam at Wimbledon in 2004 was 'undoubtedly' her greatest achievement.

'Winning your first Grand Slam is always 
special, but Wimbledon is the natural home of tennis and is steeped in 
tradition, so winning there and becoming a part of that tradition was 
truly special. Any low point can be when you know you aren't performing 
to your ability,' she said.

Maria explains that keeping her health in check is one of the most important aspects of her training regime and she has a straight forward approach to clean living.

She said: 'I wouldn’t say my diet is crazily strict
 at all. Keeping healthy is honestly very simple: everything in 
moderation.

'My team has emphasised time and time again the importance of
 keeping hydrated when training and competing, so I try to get as much 
mineral water into my regime as I can.'

She scrubs up well! Maria describes her personal style as simple and easy and cites 'effortlessly elegant' Audrey Hepburn as her all-time style icon

When she isn't training or playing, she aims to get as much rest as possible. Speaking about how she unwinds in her free time, she said: 'Rest is very important for me, and this 
can simply be quiet time at home, but I love taking a couple of friends
 and going to dinner. 

'Something indulgent - even if you have to spend a
 bit more money than you would normally - really helps relieve stress!'

While tennis is, of course, her first love, she says that she likes to maintain a bit of variety in her daily life by doing 'as many things as she can' such as yoga or pilates to keep herself 'full of 
energy'.

As well as being a top athlete, Maria has lent her good looks to the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue and modelled for Nike, Prince, and Canon, but prefers to take a natural approach to beauty.

'I think natural is the best way to go,' she said. 'For me, keeping skin looking healthy and full of vitality is the most 
fundamental ingredient for a good look.'

Empire: Maria also runs her Sugarpova candy line and is the brand ambassador for Porche, as well as Evian's Live Young campaign

While she prefers a stripped back approach to beauty, she confesses that fashion is her 'guilty pleasure'.

'I adore dressing up - certainly a guilty pleasure for me! I love vintage stores. My personal style is simple and easy and Audrey Hepburn is my all-time style icon. She was utterly gorgeous but effortlessly elegant at the same time. She was a true icon,' she said.

On top of winning tennis tournaments, running her Sugarpova candy line and being the brand ambassador for Porche, as well as Evian's Live Young campaign, Maria has just teamed up with Brighton-born chart-topping musicians Rizzle Kicks to star in their latest video.

The trio teamed up with evian, of which Maria is ambassador, to create a tennis-themed music video 
celebrating their love of all things tennis and, more specifically, 
Maria.

Starring role: Maria stars in Rizzle Kicks' tennis-themed music video, Tell Her, which celebrates their love of all things tennis and, of course, Maria

The video for their new track Tell Her sees the cheeky singers vying for the French Open star’s 
attention.

Speaking about working with the band, she said: 'It was a fun and exciting day, especially being in a music video and being able to have fun with it!

'Evian are known for their remarkable viral videos such as Baby & Me so it is cool to be a part of it and also to hear what they are coming up with next.'

Sharing her post-Wimbledon plans, the blonde player said: 'I am going to enjoy time with friends and family as much as possible as the summer is so busy, and I don’t get to see them then.'
