Swathes of the UK have been warned to expect flooding this weekend as mother nature unleashes a second barrage of stormy weather.

The Met Office has issued a warning for southern England, alerting people to the risk of localised flooding today and on Sunday as heavy rain hits the coast.

The areas caught in the eye of the powerful St Jude storm last Sunday and Monday are expected to once again bear the brunt of the bad weather - with close to one inch of rain predicted in the south east.

The news comes as forecasters say that last month was one of the mildest Octobers on record and the seventh warmest in 100 years.

Wet weekend: Heavy rain is expected in the south and eastern areas of the country, while 60mph winds are predicted in some areas of Wales

Many areas will see torrential downpours and high winds, which will continue tomorrow, with gusts of up to 60mph predicted in Wales.

The stormy weather will strengthen on Sunday when the worst of the weather arrives and the risk of flooding will be at its highest following days of rain.

There are fears the latest spell of disruptive weather will hamper recovery efforts following the impact of the worst storm in Britain for 26 years, which killed five people.

Tim Fields of the Energy Networks Association said: 'A lot of the places that are still without power are quite remote, with small numbers of people where there are downed power lines.

Powerless: Monday's storm pulled down electricity lines, including the one pictured in Brentwood, Essex, leaving thousands of homes without power

'All the network operators will be in close contact with the Met Office during the weekend and we hope to have everyone back on supply by the end of next week.

'Flooding does not normally present a huge threat to the energy infrastructure but extensive flooding would definitely pose a risk.'

Billy Payne, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said the latest spell of unwelcome weather will not be a repeat of last weekâ€™s powerful storm.

'It will not be welcomed but it is not expected to be anywhere near as bad as last week,' he said.

Destruction: St Jude's storm, the worst to hit the UK in 26 years, pulled down this two-storey scaffolding in Leyton, east London, crushing cars and blocking 100m of road

'It will still be windy but the main risk this weekend is of lots of heavy rain.

'On top of the rain we have already had it could lead to flash flooding, particularly on Sunday.'

Gemma Plumb, also of the MeteoGroup, said November will bring 'drier and chillier weather as would be expected in November' while October was the mildest the UK has seen since 2006.

The South West, south Wales and Midlands saw the highest above average temperatures, at 1.5C warmer than is usual for the month.

But although it was milder than usual, it was also the least sunny October since 2005 and the wettest in England and Wales since 2000, Ms Plumb said.
