He's got the moves, the hair and legions of female fans.

Now Socks the dancing Shetland pony and star of one of the most popular adverts of the year, has another mark of celebrity to add to the list: notches on his bedpost – and a paternity test to match.

Socks, who did a Michael Jackson-style moonwalk in the advert for mobile phone network Three, was put out to stud with three mares.

But he took a shine to another lady called Kimberley who was intended for another stallion.

This didn’t stop him however, and he swum across a loch in his native Shetland to get better acquainted.

Last month a black colt called Scamp was born. But the owners of the Benston Stud in Voe, have ordered DNA tests on the mainland to establish the identity of the father.

If conclusive, Scamp could be the first foal Socks has fathered since he shot to fame. Another foal sired by Socks and her mother died soon after giving birth last month.

Two years ago he fathered his first and only foal, a filly called Quartz, who has the same markings.

Socks’s owner Mari Williamson said: ‘He most definitely has a real eye for the ladies. He doesn’t need any encouragement.

‘I put him with three ladies in a 
field with a loch. But he is a very good swimmer and unfortunately he 
took a shine to another one of my mares who I had put in a group with my
 other stallion Nuggett.

‘He
 just fancied her more and thought the grass is always greener on the 
other side. Socks swam across – with his three ladies in tow – and now 
we don’t know for sure who is Scamp’s real father.

‘Socks
 was put in stables for two weeks after. It is costing an arm and a leg 
for the DNA tests but it is important to keep the line correct.’

If Scamp is Socks’s son, he will command an extra premium and will be sold. Mrs Williamson said Scamp is already showing signs of being Socks’s heir.

She said: ‘Scamp is a real character – cheeky and very friendly. He is a very good colt. I’m chuffed to bits with him.’

Socks’s commercial, which sees him ‘moonwalking’ on a cliff in the Shetlands to Everywhere by Fleetwood Mac, has been viewed more than 5.3million times on Youtube.

He was even given VIP treatment during filming in the shape of his own hairdresser who fitted extensions and pampered him with luxury beauty products.

And he was prepared for his starring role by local animal trainer Elaine Tait, who taught him to do the moonwalk by teaching him to paw with his hoof and rewarding him with carrots.

The advert was filmed by award-winning filmmaker Dougal Wilson, famed for his festive adverts for John Lewis.
