A five-year-old girl was crushed to death by an automatic garden gate because it was faulty and did not meet British safety standards, an inquest has heard.

Karolina Golabek died after she was trapped in a three-foot-high sliding gate for 30 minutes outside her home in Bridgend, South Wales, on July 4, 2010.

The jury ruled her death an accident after hearing the gate was faulty, unsafe and did not meet British standards.

Karolina Golabek, 5, from Bridgend, South Wales, who was crushed to death by an electric gate while she was playing at her family home, an inquest heard

The automatic gate in Brook Court, Bridgend, where Karolina died in July 2010

The four-day inquest in Aberdare, South Wales, heard that the gate should have 
closed with the force of 400 newtons - enough for someone to struggle 
free if they were trapped in it.

But Karolina was crushed because the gate had a force of 2,000 newtons.

Dr Anthony Wray of the Health and Safety Executive said: ‘It would have been impossible for the gate’s motor to detect the presence of a person.’

An inquest jury ruled the gate was unsafe due to a series of faults, inadequacies and a failure to follow British Standard guidelines

The inquest had earlier heard that construction company JB Leadbitter and Co Ltd had
not included electric gates on its plans for the development.

But the gates were fitted to make the property 'more marketable' and provide secure parking for residents, the hearing was told.

Tragedy: Karolina Golabek was trapped across her waist for 30 minutes and died later in hospital

Karolina - described as a happy, 
fun-loving little girl who loved animals, drawing pictures and picking 
flowers for her family - was seen playing at 4pm by her father Jozef, 
45.

She was discovered at 4.30pm trapped across her waist by the heavy metal gate at the entrance to communal gardens outside the family’s apartment.

A neighbour used his security key fob to open the gate and free Karolina.

Karolina had suffered massive internal injuries and died later in hospital with her parents at her bedside.

Her mother Barbara was at the inquest in Aberdare, South Wales, but her father tragically died nine months after the gate accident.

Bridgend Coroner Louise Hunt said: ‘Significant changes have been made since this event.’
