High-life: Nadir and Nur in 2010

Conman Asil Nadir was awarded nearly £2million in legal aid during his marathon trial, official figures revealed last night.

The runaway tycoon’s lawyers racked up a £1,987,743 bill at taxpayers’ expense – as he flaunted his wealth by renting a £23,000-a-month central London property and giving his young wife a new Range Rover.

Details of the 73-year-old’s enormous legal aid bill, revealed following a Freedom of Information request by the Daily Mail, will reignite the row about ‘fat cat’ defence lawyers who earn vast amounts from the public purse.

Nadir – who is now in jail in the UK –  stole almost £29million from his Polly Peck empire, then fled to his native Cyprus before returning in 2010 and vowing to clear his name in court.

Despite claiming to be a penniless bankrupt, he was chauffeured to the Old Bailey every day during his seven-month trial in a gleaming Jaguar. His glamorous wife Nur – 43 years his junior – was regularly seen shopping in the designer boutiques of Bond Street as her husband sat in the dock.

Wearing her trademark Chanel sunglasses, Cartier watch and favourite £4,000 Hermes Kelly handbag, she was seen strutting through the West End carrying expensive purchases from Harrods.

Her mid-trial birthday present from her husband – a Range Rover Vogue – had a personal number plate AN02NUR, standing for ‘Asil Nadir love to Nur’.

But despite assembling a high-powered legal team, Nadir was convicted of plundering tens of millions from Polly Peck and jailed for ten years in 2012. He was ordered to pay £5million compensation or face a further six years jail.

Last night the Serious Fraud Office said the £5million payment had now been made ‘in full’ but was unable to say how the supposedly broke tycoon had paid up.

A spokesman said: ‘You would have to ask Mr Nadir himself.’

Nadir built Polly Peck from an East End rag trade company into one listed on the FTSE 100 during the Thatcher boom years. It collapsed when he was arrested by the SFO in 1990.

Three years later, while awaiting trial on 66 counts of theft, he fled Britain in the middle of the night for the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. After 17 years, he returned to the UK in a private jet. Owing to the complexity of the case, his trial did not start until January 2012.

The jury found he raided the company to pay for his multi-million-pound property empire, racehorses, antiques, fast cars and jewellery.

But on the orders of the judge, he will have to serve only half of his sentence, meaning he is eligible for release in August 2017. Fraud investigators suspect Nadir has tens of millions of pounds stashed away in secret accounts or offshore trusts.

He could even be returned to Cyprus – where he has a £3million villa – before 2017 if he makes a successful application under the ‘prisoner transfer’ scheme.

In the 1980s Nadir donated £440,000 to the Conservative Party which it has refused to return despite his conviction.

Allowing him to go home might leave the Government open to charges it was doing a favour for a disgraced former party donor – meaning it is unlikely he will be repatriated before the General Election next year. According to the Ministry of Justice, Nadir’s solicitors earned a total of £769,352 and charged a further £189,303 in ‘disbursements’ for defending the disgraced tycoon. His barristers received £1,029,088.

When he was convicted two years ago, his wife Nur said he was innocent and announced he would appeal, which could land taxpayers with a further multi-million-pound bill.

It was thought his Kuwait-born wife planned to stay here while her husband’s appeal is heard before returning to Northern Cyprus.

But reports emerged last November in the Turkish-language media, that she was demanding a £5million divorce. Last night, she dismissed the claims, telling the Mail: ‘No, I have not divorced Mr Nadir.’

The Ministry of Justice said that since Nadir’s conviction, the Legal Aid Agency had recovered £153,039 from him, towards his legal costs.

It added: ‘We absolutely agree legal aid costs must represent better value. We are cutting fees in criminal legal aid cases.’

Nadir’s lawyer did not respond to questions from the Mail.
