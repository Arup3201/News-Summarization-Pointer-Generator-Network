Shock: Isabelle Guyler died at her home during a 'fit of pique', said the coroner, who recorded a verdict of 'death by misadventure

A 'happy' 12-year-old girl was found hanged at her home when an 'attention-seeking gesture went tragically wrong', an inquest heard.

Isabelle Guyler - known as Izzy - died at her home in Wilford, Notts, during a 'fit of pique', Nottingham coroner Mairin Casey ruled.

Ms Casey, who recorded a verdict of death by misadventure, said: 'I find generally that Isabelle was a normal, happy child who came from a happy home.

'This seemed to be a spontaneous gesture taken in a fit of pique, an attention-seeking gesture that went tragically wrong.'

Following Isabelle’s death, rumours 
circulated online that she had been bullied, but the inquest heard there
was no evidence whatsoever to support the claims.

Ms Casey added: ‘She was popular with her friends at
school, lively and bubbly with what has been described as a "dominant personality".

'It is also clear to me that Isabelle was at times prone to dramatic gestures,
not unusual for a girl of her age and certainly not outside of the norm…

‘Police have investigated the possibility of bullying very
fully – it has been very distressing for many that there has been much
misinformation shared on social network sites that has even extended to
accusations and threats – at the conclusion of this thorough investigation,
there is no evidence that Isabelle was a victim of bullying at school or
elsewhere at the time of her death.

‘The Guyler family have indicated that they do not wish to
make public comment at this time. They ask that this wish be respected and that
they be permitted to grieve privately as they approach the first anniversary of
Isabelle’s death.’

Scores of flowers, teddies and balloons were left for Isabelle outside Nottingham Emmanuel School in the days after her death last December 9.

Two pink, heart-shaped helium balloons tied to the gates read: 'To Izzy RIP. Love you more every day. Fly high princess.'

Adored: She was described as a 'normal, happy child from a happy home'

Friends also left letters were pinned to the gates.

One read: 'To Izzy, you were the best girl ever and I’m never gonna forget you.

'I can’t believe you’re gone, it still feels unreal, gonna miss you baby cakes, love you so much.'

Another said: 'Sweet precious girl 
safe in God’s arms. So tragic. There was a better answer safe in the 
arms of your family. You’ll stay in their hearts.'

Classmates described Isabelle as a 'beautiful angel' on a Facebook tribute group.

A video was also posted on YouTube, showing a selection of pictures of Isabelle with her friends at school and when she was younger and playing over Britney Spears song Everytime.

One Twitter tribute message was retweeted by Big Brother celebrity RebeckahVaughan to her 26,000 followers.

Nottingham South MP Lilian Greenwood described it as an 'appalling tragedy' at the time.

She added: 'My thoughts are with her friends and family.

'It's particularly important to know what went wrong and make sure it's treated as an extremely high priority.'

In a statement last year, Emmanuel School headteacher Carol Fearria said: 'Everyone at the school is deeply shocked by what has happened.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with family and friends and we will be doing everything we can to support them over the coming days and weeks.'

Pupils arranged a two-minute silence at lunchtime on the
first day back at school after Isabelle's death and many classmates and other students were offered counselling.

Karen Roebuck, whose 12-year-old son Matthew was in a maths
class with Isabelle, said at the time: 'This is so sad. It's a complete
tragedy. When I heard about the news, I felt so cold.'

Another parent, whose 11-year-old daughter goes to the
school, said: 'I never expected it would happen here. It's awful, especially
for the family.

'I feel a bit easier that the police are saying it wasn't
bullying. But it's still very, very sad.'

Chairman of the school governors, Heidi Shewell-Cooper,
said: 'We are grateful to all our partners for working with the whole school
community so quickly to ensure a programme of support for our students today,
and also how sensitively our students have been able to support one another
through this tragic situation.'

Claire Meese, director of education for the Diocese of
Southwell and Nottingham, said: 'The whole school community has pulled together
in a remarkable way to ensure students are fully supported at this very difficult
time.'
