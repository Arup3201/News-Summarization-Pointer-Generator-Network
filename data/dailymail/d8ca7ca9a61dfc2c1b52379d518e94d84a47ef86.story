The man behind a fundraising dinner where Mitt Romney was secretly filmed disparaging President Obama's supporters as welfare dependents - has reportedly planned another event in support of his presidential campaign.

The Republican leader was criticised after a recording of him saying that 47 per cent of voters planning to back President Obama believed they were 'entitled' to government support and considered themselves 'victims,' was posted online.

Businessman Marc Leder, who hosted the fundraiser where the comments were made in May, is reported to have said he has organised another event in Florida this Saturday out of an apparent sense of obligation to Mr Romney following the fall-out from the secret film.

Plan: Marc Leder hosted the $50,000-a-plate fundraiser where Mr Romney made his much-criticised remarks in May. He has reportedly helped organise another fundraiser for the Republican campaign this Saturday

A separate 
fundraiser for the Romney Campaign, also co-hosted by Mr Leder is believed to be planned for Friday night in Boca 
Raton, Florida, according to reports.

In the secret recording from the May event, which was leaked on the left-leaning Mother Jones website, Mr Romney said 47 percent of the people who
will vote for the president 'are dependent upon government.'

He said they 'believe that, that they
are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care
for them' and 'that they are entitled to health care, to food, 
to housing.'

Mr Romney said the people he referred to would vote for the president 'no matter what' and that he would not worry about them because he would 'never convince them they should take 
personal responsibility and care for their lives.'

James Carter, grandson of former 
Democratic president Jimmy Carter, put reporters from Mother Jones in 
touch with an unnamed individual 
who had shot the secret footage.

Mission: The video was posted online by the Mother Jones website with the help of James Carter (pictured) grandson of former president Jimmy Carter

Comments: Mr Romney (seen here during the town hall debate with President Obama at Hofstra University in New York, on Tuesday) has since retracted the remarks

Leaked: Mother Jones, a liberal news magazine, says it obtained the footage from an anonymous person who attended the fundraiser

Bona fide: The Romney campaign did not dispute the authenticity of the video

Mr Romney's comments were used by his critics to dismiss him as 'out of touch.'

The Republican leader has since retracted the comments saying they were 'just completely 
wrong.'

His campaign team is believed to have tightened rules on the recording of fundraising events following the leak.

Mr Leder, who is reported to be a 
leveraged buy-out specialist, has been telling potential donors that he 
wants to 'make the situation right' by raising more funds for the Romney
campaign, according to the Huffington Post.

Facts: Romney has statistics on his side when it comes to the 47 percent comment -- only 53 percent of Americans pay federal income tax after deductions and rebates

The Post quoted one donor saying that Mr Leder had been 'taking heat' following the fundraiser.

Unlike the last event, which was 
hosted by Mr Leder at his home, Saturday's dinner is reportedly being 
held at a venue in Palm Beach, Florida.

Mr Leder - who is the co-owner of the Philadelphia 76ers - has an increasing public profile.

The businessman is currently co-chief executive officer of Sun Capital Partners, based in Boca Raton, Florida.

Mr Leder, who is noted for his philanthropy, was raised in Long Island and has three children.
