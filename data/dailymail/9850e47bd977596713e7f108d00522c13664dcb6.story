A stroke victim is hoping to smile for the first time in 10 years - with the help of transplanted muscles from her forehead.

Sara McKay, 45, suffered a  stroke, leading doctors to diagnose a life-threatening brain tumour.

The mother-of-two from Consett in County Durham, has spent years learning to walk and talk again. 

She lost the ability to smile after the left side of her face was paralysed.

Now she has undergone an operation at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where surgeons removed muscles from her forehead and replanted them into her left cheek, in an effort to bring some movement back to her face.

Sara McKay, 45, from Consett in County Durham has just undergone an operation which could help her smile again, after a stroke and a brain tumour left her paralysed and without movement on the left side of her face. She says her husband George, 43, has been her 'lifeline'

Mrs McKay said: 'Hopefully this will try to help my mouth to move, meaning that I can fully smile again. I knew if I didn't get it done, I would always regret it.

'I'm now waiting to see if the operation's been successful; they said it could take a little while.'

As her husband George, 43, is in the army, Mrs McKay was living in barracks in Germany when she first fell ill in 2004.

She said: 'George was in the Scots Guards and we were living in Munster with our two children.

'In June 2004 I had a stroke and, when tests were carried out, they discovered a brain tumour on my brain stem.

'By the following year the tumour had started to grow and suddenly I was in a 'live or die' situation. 

'There was no option but to have an operation to remove it.

'I'd lost all movement down one side and, following the operation, I had to learn how to walk and speak all over again.'

Throughout her illness, Mrs McKay said husband George became her lifeline.

'He was always there for me,' she said. 'If it hadn't been for him I don't know how we would have got through everything.'

The couple returned from Germany in 2008 and Mrs McKay is continuing with her rehabilitation.

Determined not to be beaten, she now goes to the gym and can walk with the help of a stick.

Mrs McKay's condition also left her with facial palsy, meaning the left side of her face was paralysed.

Surgeons at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle removed muscles from the top of Mrs McKay's forehead and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile

It prevents her mouth from moving on one side, but she has always hoped that one day she would be able to smile again.

Finally, this summer surgeons at the RVI removed muscles from the top of her head and planted them in her cheek in the hope of allowing her to smile.

She is now waiting to see if the operation will work, and is coping with the help of her husband and two children Samantha, 21, and Robert, 19.

Her daughter Samantha said: 'My mum has been through so many operations but always came back fighting strong.

'Dad looked after me and my brother, as well as being deployed to Iraq. They are both my heroes and I'm so proud to call them my parents.'
