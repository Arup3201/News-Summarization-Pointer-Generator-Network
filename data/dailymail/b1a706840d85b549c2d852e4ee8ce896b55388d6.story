Pervert: Violent sex offender Steven Strange attacked a lone woman after she rebuffed his advances

A sex offender who brutally attacked a young woman after she spurned his advances was tracked down because she had accepted his phone number in an attempt to get rid of him, a court was told.

Convicted rapist Steven Strange, from Bristol, insisted on walking his victim home before knocking her out and then kissing and groping her as she lay unconscious in a graveyard.

The terrified young woman, who was told if she screamed she would be stabbed, came round and managed to piece together what had happened before going straight to the police and handing them his phone number.

Strange, 25, has pleaded guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and sexual assault at Bristol Crown Court and was jailed for four years.

Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said the woman had been out with friends and was walking home alone at 4am when Strange appeared, asked her for a light and chatted to her.

Mr Hollier said: ‘The defendant insisted he would walk her home.

‘She was not keen to be walked to her home and walked past the turning to her road. She was on her phone to a friend. She was trying to go to his home, where she would then stay.’

The court heard Strange insisted he would walk her there and, to placate him, she took his mobile number and promised they would speak.

Mr Hollier said: ‘He said he would text her when he got home.

‘He gave her a hug and she hugged him back, like friends would hug to say goodbye.

‘He then kissed her, which was not welcome, gave her a longer hug and when she said she should go home he grabbed her against a parked car and she was not able to break free.’

Disgusting: Strange beat the young girl before taking her to a graveyard and assaulting her

Mr Hollier said Strange pushed the woman to the pavement, where she banged her head, and said: 'If you scream I’ll stab you.'

Frightened she would be raped, she screamed and the attacker punched her repeatedly in the face and mouth.

The court heard she woke up bleeding in a churchyard, where she rang police with the details she had been given.

Strange was arrested at 5.15pm that day and denied everything, but was picked out from an identity line-up.

He had a previous jail term for rape, the court heard.

Judge David Ticehurst was told the attacker could not face coming into court to hear his fate.

He imposed a sentence comprising of four years’ prison and three years’ extended licence, for public protection.

He described the victim as robust in spirit and told the court: ‘She says she feels partly responsible for the sexual assault because she was walking home alone. She says “I feel stupid”.

‘She should feel no sense of responsibility what so ever.

‘She is perfectly entitled to walk home in the early hours of the morning. She is perfectly entitled to think she will not be molested by a man of Steven Strange’s nature and character.'

Rosaleen Collins, defending, said her client had shame and guilt and understood the impact on the victim.

She described him as a lonely young man who had had no contact with his family since he was jailed in 2007.
