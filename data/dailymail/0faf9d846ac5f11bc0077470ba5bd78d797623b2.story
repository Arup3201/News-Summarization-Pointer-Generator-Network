Police in Michigan believe a Xanax pill found inside a plastic egg during a pre-school Easter hunt on Wednesday was placed there on purpose as a prank.

Authorities say the children at Huron Park Elementary School in Roseville were told to each bring in seven of the plastic eggs, which were to be filled with candy and taped shut.

With 30 to 40 students involved, hundreds of the eggs were hidden in the garden by teachers for the hunt.

Shocked: Michigan mom Amber Pruchniewski found a generic Xanax pill inside an easter egg her daughter was given at school

Pruchniewski said her daughter (pictured) said her daughter brought several plastic eggs following an Easter hunt at school, and that the prescription-only pill was found inside one of them

Mother Amber Pruchniewski said her four-year-old daughter came home with several that day.

When her little girl was going through the findings on the floor, Pruchniewski noticed a white pill among jellybeans in one of the casings.

The pill turned out to be single dose of Alprazolam, a generic form of Xanax.

'I just want to know who did it - it's careless,' Pruchniewski told Fox News.

She took the pill into the school the next day and tshowed the principal.

The police were then brought in.

Police Chief Donald Glandon told WWJ-TV 
he thinks the incident was 'intentional and criminal', but that it's still 
too early to identify a possible suspect.

Superintendent of Roseville Community Schools, John Kment, said no other parents had reported anything strange resulting from the egg hunt.

He said a letter was sent home to all parents advising them of the incident.
