With his thrilling five-set US Open victory, Andy Murray is assured of a place in the tennis history books.

His epic triumph also brings the promise of more immediate material rewards, however.

Experts yesterday predicted that by ending the nation's 76-year wait for a Grand Slam men's singles champion, Murray's career earnings could now top £100million – making him one of Britain's richest sports superstars.

His four-hour, 54-minute win over 
Novak Djokovic was worth almost £1.2million in prize money alone. But 
that will be dwarfed by the riches set to flood into the 25-year-old's 
bank account.

Coupled with his Olympic Gold 
medal-winning defeat of Roger Federer last month, the US Open result 
will see major international sponsors clamour for a piece of 'Brand 
Murray'.

Murray already has a £15million 
five-year deal with Adidas, as well as lucrative contracts with Royal 
Bank of Scotland, Head racquets and Jaguar.

According to the Sunday Times Sport 
Rich List, his £24million fortune makes him the UK's 42nd-richest 
sportsman. But by joining tennis's elite Grand Slam club and emulating 
the achievement of Fred Perry – the last Briton to see such success, 
with eight Slams between 1933 and 1936 – the young Scot is likely to 
have huge brands such as Coca-Cola and Visa lining up to be associated 
with him.

Nigel Currie, of sports marketing 
agency BrandRapport, said: 'Andy Murray could realistically triple his 
off-court earnings from sponsorship, advertising and endorsements to 
reach around £20million in the next 12 months.

'Tennis and golf are two of the few 
genuinely global sports that reach every country and as one of the top 
four players in tennis he has a huge global profile.

'The last obstacle to him really moving into the very top league of sports earners was winning a Grand Slam tournament.

'Once you're a Grand Slam winner 
you're in a unique group, and it's that uniqueness that becomes highly 
marketable. He will become one of the few athletes who is recognised in 
every part of the world.'

One reward Murray is not apparently 
angling for, however, is a knighthood.

He said: 'A lot of my friends 
have been messaging me about it. I think it should maybe take more than 
just one or two good tournaments to deserve something like that, but I 
think people will be saying that because it's been such a long time 
since it happened in tennis. It would probably be a bit rash.'

Praise from the PM: David Cameron hailed Andy Murray's triumph as a 'truly great victory'

Licence to thrill: Comedian David Walliams joked on Twitter that support from James Bond actor Sir Sean Connery had helped Murray win the title

Cheer: Hollywood actor Kevin Spacey, who was among the crowd watching the match, tweeted his congratulations to Murray after the match

Murray's win, capping a golden summer 
of British sport, came in a stunning performance witnessed by a crowd 
featuring a strong contingent of British celebrities.

Sir Sean Connery was joined by Sir 
Patrick Stewart, young actors Andrew Garfield and Jack Huston and 
Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to cheer on Murray at the 
Arthur Ashe Stadium.

American actors Kevin Spacey and Mad 
Men star Jon Hamm were also there. As the plaudits rolled in, David 
Cameron was quick to hail the triumph a 'truly great victory'.

Murray's manager Simon Fuller was among the delighted spectators, seeing one of his sporting clients make history.

But the man behind the 19 management 
group that also looks after David Beckham and Lewis Hamilton must now 
try to persuade his charge to re-sign when his contract expires in 
December – just at the time when Murray's commercial potential has 
rocketed.
