Angel di Maria will prove his detractors wrong and become a hit at Manchester United, believes the club's former defender Rio Ferdinand.

Di Maria made an impressive start to his career at Old Trafford following his £60million summer switch from Real Madrid last summer.

The 27-year-old netted three times in his first five games for the Red Devils but has since struggled for form since in recent weeks.

Despite providing the assist for Wayne Rooney's goal in their 2-1 FA Cup sixth round exit to Arsenal on Monday night, Di Maria's night ended prematurely as he was sent off in the second half.

Regardless of his dismissal, Ferdinand is adamant that the Argentina international's star qualities will be evident once he has had time adapt to playing in the Premier League.

'I thought [Angel] Di Maria was a great signing for [Manchester] United and I still think he was a good signing because he is a top player,' Ferdinand told Goal.

'He was arguably [Real] Madrid's best player last year, him and [Cristiano] Ronaldo were their standout players. I think he is a highly talented player.

'But it always takes time for a player to adapt to his new surroundings, especially when you go to a foreign league. Not every player can be like Ronaldo and just turn up and instantly become a superstar. Maybe it will take Di Maria a bit longer. It might take him a year, you never know.

'But his style does suit the Premier League. He is quick, runs at people, hungry to create chances and commit people. I think he is a very talented player and I like him.'
