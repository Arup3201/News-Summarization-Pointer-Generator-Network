Eric Head, from Canada, is a real life toy boy.

The 19-year-old spends his days collecting, styling and photographing expensive dolls into modern and ‘ghetto-cute’ styles.

The photography student loves nothing more than dressing up and photographing his dolls with gold chains and huge gold hooped earrings.

And the dolls that he collects are a far cry from your traditional Barbie dolls – his are the brainchild of American fashion designer Jason Wu, and are called Fashion Royalty Dolls.

They can cost as much as £1,000.

Mr Head's pictures are shot to mimic the look of high fashion magazine shoots, with the dolls posing in suggestive and sultry poses.

The young photographer spends hours styling and then photographing his dolls, even painstakingly adding individual eyelashes or changing their eye colour to create the perfect look.

He said: 'The dolls are very fun to customize yourself, even the simplest things like adding eyelashes to make them look much more real.

'I cut off one doll's hair and purchased synthetic 'flock' hair from eBay, and gave her a new hair do.

'I started by cutting off all of her hair, and plucking out the excess from the rooting holes. I then painted her scalp black.

He said it was 'very fun' to customise the dolls himself and even simple additions made them look more realistic

'Then I paint Kraft glue over her entire scalp and dust the flock on top of her head and let her dry. I then repeat the process five more times, and voila, she has a completely new look.'

Mr Head who has been playing with dolls since he was a child, loves nothing more than styling his dolls and photographing them and he posts all of his work on his Flickr page.

He said: 'The inspiration comes from many things that I see in my day. I'm an avid fan of modern fashion.

'I also truthfully just love ghetto-cute fashion, and the combination of high class dolls and low class ghetto fashion just excites me. I've been playing with dolls since I was a little boy, so it's no surprise to me that I'm now a doll collector.'

He said his inspiration for the dolls' styles came from everything he saw in day-to-day life and modern fashion

These two dolls, like many others in Eric Head's collection, are based on a high fashion magazine photo shoot

Mr Head said he had been playing with dolls since he was small, so it was 'no surprise' he was now a collector

The dolls are not everyday Barbies - they are Fashion Royalty Dolls which can cost up to £1,000
