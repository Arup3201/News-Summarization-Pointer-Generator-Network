Children are notoriously fussy eaters. So one airline is calling in the experts to help design its new menu for youngsters - the kids themselves.

Monarch Airlines enlisted the advice of children from across the UK to taste-test a range of meals specially created from British kids’ favourite dishes.

The panel marked the dishes on taste, smell and presentation and gave each dish an overall score, providing detailed comments on each one.

Meatballs with tomato sauce and wholemeal penne pasta, and roast chicken dinner with all the trimmings are the dishes that came out on top, and will be available to the 19,000 children who fly with the airline every year.  

The children were joined in their deliberations by Pudsey Bear, and a donation from each meal sold will go to BBC Children in Need.

Recipes were whipped up by Carl Jones, head chef at Alpha LSG - the airline's on board partner - and were put to the test. 

Rayna Constantine, 10, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said that the meatballs were 'better than my mum's by a million!'

Seven-year-old Erin-Isla Yates, seven, from Leeds, said: 'The roast potatoes were the nicest'.

The crunchy chicken bites with crispy potatoes, sweetcorn and peas however, were less popular with the panel, with comments such as 'I don't like the sauce', 'I hate peas' and that it 'just smells of plain chicken'.

Charlotte Cornwell, 11 from Epsom, Surrey, said: 'I was really excited to help pick the meals. I'm not keen on some foods, but these were all really tasty – my favourite was the meatballs - the pasta was soft and the meatballs weren't chewy. It also looked really good in the dish.'

Charlotte's mother Julie said: 'This is such a great idea – I've lost count of the times when one of the children hasn't wanted to eat their airline meal on a flight.' 

Pauline Prow, Chair of The Monarch Foundation, said: 'As part of our partnership with BBC Children in Need, we are delighted to support the 2014 BBC Children in Need campaign through our new on-board children's meals.

Big decisions: The youngsters took their responsibilities very seriously and gave extremely detailed feedback

'The panel knew they were making some big decisions and took their responsibilities very seriously. Their feedback was extremely detailed and certainly gave us all a lot to think about.' 

Carrie Green, Head of Partnerships at BBC Children in Need, said: 'We are so pleased to be working with Monarch and to be receiving a donation from their kids' meals. 

'Every penny donated will help to make a difference to the lives of disadvantaged children and young people right here in the UK. 

'By buying a kids' meal on their flight, families are also helping others at the same time. As a child-focused charity, it was great to know that an expert panel of children had fun choosing the meals too!'

The first meals will be served to Monarch's young passengers on November 1. The meals cost £5.99 with 50p from every children's meal sold donated to BBC Children in Need.
