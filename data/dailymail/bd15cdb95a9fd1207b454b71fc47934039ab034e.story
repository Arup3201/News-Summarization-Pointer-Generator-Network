Fruit smoothies and juices sold as healthy drinks for children can contain 60 per cent more sugar than Coca-Cola, a survey has found.

One leading cardiologist said the drinks are so unhealthy that they should be seen as a treat rather than a normal part of a daily diet.

A 200ml serving of Coca-Cola contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar. The same amount of some fruit smoothies can contain up to eight.

The unhealthy truth: One leading cardiologist said the drinks are so unhealthy that they should be seen as a treat rather than a normal part of a daily diet

A 200ml serving of Coca-Cola contains the equivalent of five teaspoons of sugar, but a 200ml serving of this Sainsbury's Apple & Blackcurrant smoothie (right) contains the equivalent of seven teaspoons of sugar

These include Tesco’s Goodness Slurper smoothies for kids in apple and banana flavour, and Ella’s Kitchen’s The Yellow One Squished Smoothie Fruits, which contains apple, banana, mango and apricots.

The products are sold in servings smaller than 200ml, so the sugar hit is reduced. 

However, health campaigners say the survey results give a good indication of just how much sugar they contain. 

The research by Action on Sugar found that more than a quarter of drinks – 57 of the 203 – contain at least as much sugar as Coca-Cola.

And a quarter of all the drinks contained sugar or glucose-fructose syrup as an added ingredient. The campaigning group warned that high-sugar drinks are fuelling obesity.

At the same time tooth decay is the most common reason for children in England being admitted to hospital.

When a whole fruit is processed into a drink, the sugars in the cell walls are released as ‘free sugars’ which damage the teeth, while the absence of fibre means you take in more calories.

Chairman of Action on Sugar, Professor Graham MacGregor, said: ‘It is a complete scandal that these drinks are marketed to children and parents as if they are “healthy”. This has to stop.’

Dr Aseem Malhotra, a cardiologist and science director of the group, added: ‘Fruit juice and smoothies should not be part of a healthy, balanced diet.

‘There is increasing scientific evidence that regular sugary drink consumption is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease, independent of body weight.’

Gavin Partington, of the British Soft Drinks Association, said: ‘It is unfortunate this survey omits to mention the established health benefits of fruit juice, such as vitamin C.’
