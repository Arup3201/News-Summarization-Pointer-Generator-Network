The organiser of a fireworks display under investigation after a horrendous crash on the M5 has been forced out of his home after a hate campaign.

Geoff Counsell, from Firestorm Pyrotechnics was targeted after the bonfire night celebration became the centre of a police investigation into the pile-up that killed seven people and injured 51 others.

Claims that thick smoke from the display held in Taunton, Somerset earlier this month drifted across the motorway before the accident and limiting drivers' vision are being looked into by police.

Over 200 witnesses of the pile up at Junction 25, in Taunton have been interviewed in an attempt to establish the cause of the collision.

According to the Sunday Times many have given differing statements.

The newspaper reported that a reliable witness explained that the fog was so dense just before the crash, that he could not see the pavement on the other side of the road.

Mr Counsell has said he had carried out a full safety review before the display. 

He said: 'I can guarantee I would not have fired the display if it was the slightest bit unsafe. There was no more smoke than usual.'

He did admit, however, the fog was so thick that he couldn’t even see the 1,000 strong crowd.'

He said: 'I wouldn’t have driven in those conditions unless I had to.’

The newspaper reported that CCTV footage of the accident was unavailable as the cameras were pointing the other way at the time of the crash.

Avon and Somerset police, who are 
investigating the crash have appealed for bystanders to handover any 
footage they may have captured to help them pinpoint the cause.

However both
the rugby club and Counsell are believed to be considering making a 
formal complaint against Somerset Assistant Chief Constable Anthony 
Bangham.

It is claimed that comments he made suggested a 'criminal investigation' would focus on the fireworks event - which both Mr Counsell and the club believe could be prejudicial.

A friend of Mr Counsell told the newspaper: 'He acted entirely in good faith throughout the organisation for and the execution of the event.

'He can't believe what has happened since. The comments of the ACC were premature and ill-thought out, especially when you consider what had happened as a result of them.'

Transport minister Mike Penning has appeared to suggest the smoke that caused the crash may not have come from fireworks, as previously suggested.

He said: 'Once these lorries caught fire, diesel produces a very black acrid smoke, the tyres were alight, the plastics were alight.

'That mixing with mist or fog would create something that people might have thought was there before but was not there before but was part of the accident.'

In a statement, the management of the rugby club said: 'As a family-based community club Taunton RFC held a fireworks display on the evening of the 4th November.

'Taunton RFC is working closely with Avon and Somerset police to assist with their investigations.'
