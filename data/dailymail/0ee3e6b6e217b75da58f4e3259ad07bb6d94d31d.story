Duck Dynasty may be embroiled in a gay sex row with it's star suspended but the show certainly has one big admirer - President Obama.

Obama professed his love of Duck Dynasty in an exclusive interview with People magazine that came out Friday.

In answer to the question, 'Who would you rather spend the day with: Kim and Kanye or the Duck Dynasty Family?' he chose the Duck Dynasty family.

He may be regretting the choice after Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson made controversial statements linking homosexuality to bestiality in an interview with GQ magazine.

Big fan: The President has professed his love of 'Duck Dynasty', saying he watches it on Air Force One

The Duck Commander creator has been suspended 'indefinitely' from the show by network A&E for the comments.

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what’s wrong… Sin becomes fine. Start with homosexual behaviour and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men,' Phil Robertson told the magazine.

The President gave his interview to People magazine before Phil Robertson's comments came to light.

'The Duck Dynasty family seems like a pretty fun bunch,' he told People. 'I can see how that would be pretty fun.'

It's not the first time the President has expressed a fondness for the Louisiana clan.

According
 to the Christian Broadcasting Network's White House Correspondent 
Jennifer Wishon, the President requested the presence of Duck Dynasty's 
Willie and Korie Robertson at his private pre-dinner reception.

She writes that she was walking towards the ballroom with Willie and Korie Robertson, her guests for the evening, when a man dressed in a black suit approached and whisked the two away.

'I'm with the White House and I need you to come with me,' he said.

The pair returned 45 minutes later after waiting in line behind Conan O'Brien and in front of Nicole Kidman to greet President Obama.

Willie Robertson told Wishon that the President told him he love Duck Dynasty.

'He said he loves the show and watches it on Air Force One,' Robertson said, adding that Obama had also presented him with a pair of cufflinks.
