A pensioner accused of registering a mannequin as a candidate in a city council election is to face trial.

Renee Slater is alleged to have put 
the dummy - named Helena Torry - forward to stand in Aberdeen City 
Council's local government elections on March 29.

The 64-year-old denied the charge, 
made under the Representation of the People Act, when she appeared at 
the city's sheriff court on Friday.

The charge alleges that she submitted a
nomination paper containing the dummy's details, which she knew to be 
false, to a returning officer at the council's Town House.

Miss Slater, of Aberdeen, is to face trial next month.

Police confiscated the dummy - which was detained indefinitely - after swooping on Slater for the alleged electoral fraud.

Council chiefs’ suspicions were
alerted after a ‘Helena Torry’ was registered as an 
independent candidate in the Aberdeen City Council poll on May 3.

She
was put forward to represent the city’s Hazlehead/Ashley/Queen’s Cross 
ward, apparently to fight for ‘equality for human beings, ensuring there
is a fair deal for everyone and giving a voice to the silent majority’.

Candidate: 'Helena Torry', pictured, was registered as an independent candidate in the Aberdeen City Council poll on May 3

But ‘Miss Torry’
turned out to be a 5ft mannequin, standing in the ward whose residents 
include businessman Sir Ian Wood, backer of the controversial project to
revamp the centre of Aberdeen.

But
on shop-owner Miss Slater was taken into custody and 
questioned for six hours by Grampian Police, after having identification
pictures, fingerprints and DNA samples taken.

She is now banned from any polling stations other than in her own ward.

On
April 2, Aberdeen City Council published a revised Notice of Poll for 
the ward, ahead of the election which is due to take place on May 3.

Returning
Officer Valerie Watts said at the time: 'It has been brought to my attention that 
Helena Torry, for whom a nomination paper was submitted for the 
Hazlehead, Ashley and Queens Cross ward, does not exist.

'Miss Torry' turned out to be a 5ft mannequin, standing for election in Scotland. The mannequin - which it understood to have been seized by police - originally appeared on the list of potential councillors for the Hazlehead, Ashley and Queens Cross ward

'I am, therefore, republishing the Notice of Poll for that ward, deleting the reference to the fake candidate.

'This is a very serious and 
unusual step to take but is necessary to ensure that the interests of 
the genuine candidates and voters are protected, and that the election 
can take place on May 3.

'The
nomination paper for Helena Torry was submitted shortly before the 
close of nominations on March 3 and contained all the information 
required by statute for a valid nomination.'

In
this case, it is clear from public statements from the purported 
election agent that the information on the form was inaccurate to the 
point of rendering the nomination a complete nullity, which can be 
disregarded for the purposes of the election.'

She added that 'those concerned' would be billed for all costs involved in dealing with the matter.

Ms Slater told STV News: 'This is not a police issue. This is an Aberdeen City Council issue.

'I think the police have much more important things to deal with than me.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
