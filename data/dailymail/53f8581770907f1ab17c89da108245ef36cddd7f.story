Tottenham have joined clubs preparing to bid for Belgium's latest starlet Divock Origi.

The 19-year-old has been scouted by Liverpool and Arsenal this season after emerging as a rising star with Lille in the French league.

Impact: Origi, who has come through at Lille this season, scored the only goal in Belgium's win over Russia

Prospect: The 19-year-old has already been scouted by several top Premier League clubs after a good season

He has been used as a substitute by Belgium for Romelu Lukaku and to good effect scoring the winner against Russia on Sunday. 

The young striker scored five times for Lille in the French League last season, and featured in 30 of their 38 games, as they finished third.

Join the club: Origi would join Belgian internationals Jan Vertonghen (above) and Nacer Chadli if he made the move

Lille want around £8m for Origi but Tottenham will open the bidding at around £5million.
