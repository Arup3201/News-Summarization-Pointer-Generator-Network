A £30,000-a-week Manchester United footballer has denied having a relationship with his manager’s daughter.

Wilfried Zaha, 21, condemned claims that the reason he was not being picked for games by David Moyes was because of a relationship with the boss of the Premier League side's daughter Lauren.

The winger, who has struggled to break into the team since his £15milllion move from Crystal Palace in the summer, told his 490,000 Twitter followers that he had never even met Miss Moyes, 19.

'False accusations': Zaha posted the denial yesterday ahead of today's home league fixture against Newcastle

Ahead of today’s home league defeat against Newcastle United, Zaha said yesterday afternoon: ‘I've never 
dated or even met David Moyes’s daughter, so that isn't the reason for 
my absence in games.

‘I would like to stop all these false accusations. I will play for Manchester United when my manager feels I'm ready.’

Zaha
 has only played three times for the Red Devils so far this season - in the 
2-0 Community Shield win over Wigan Athletic in August, the 4-0 
League Cup victory over Norwich City in October and the 1-0 defeat to Newcastle today.

Club
 message boards and social media websites were rife with claims about 
why he was not being picked by Mr Moyes, who took over management of the
 club from Sir Alex Ferguson in the summer.

But Zaha moved to dismiss the rumours yesterday, before later deleting the tweets. His agent also said that the claims were ‘rubbish’.

Miss Moyes deleted her Twitter account when the rumours first surfaced in October, with Zaha moving at the time to describe the claims on Twitter as ‘silly’.

Zaha, who is expected to be loaned out next month, has been watching from the sidelines as his team have struggled in the league under their new manager - currently sitting in ninth.

Mr Moyes, 50, who is married to Pamela, has two children - Lauren, and 22-year-old David Jnr.
