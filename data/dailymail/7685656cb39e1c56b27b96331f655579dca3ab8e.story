A new range of make-up inspired by the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey movie will enable fans of the literary phenomenon to unleash their 'inner Anastasia Steele'.

Created by world-renowned cosmetics brand Make Up Forever, the limited-edition collection features four different beauty sets, which mirror the sexual awakening of the book's central character Anastasia as she embarks on a passionate relationship with mysterious billionaire Christian Grey.

According to WWD.com, the beauty range, which is due to hit stores on December 26, 'starts out sweet and gets increasingly passionate and sultry'.

Luscious lips: Two lip trios will be included in the collection, with each showing a different side to Anastasia's character

While the beauty products are free from handcuffs and whips, the rope-bound 'Desire Me' blush trio and brush ($49) is sure to raise a few eyebrows.

Then there is the $79 'Give In To Me' set, which includes a four-shade eyeshadow palette, eyeliner, lipstick, lip gloss and mascara and comes complete with a lockable keepsake box, perfect for hiding any illicit secrets.

The range, which will be sold exclusively at Sephora, also includes two 'Tease Me Lip Trios', in 'Innocent' and 'Passionate'. Priced at $32 each, they feature a smudge-proof lip liner, a long-wearing lip gloss, and a more lightweight lip gloss.

And it seems the Make Up Forever collection is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of new Fifty Shades of Grey merchandise. 

Earlier this year the book's author, E.L. James, posted a series of images of new products that are set to be released alongside the movie, including Fifty Shades wine and bondage gear.

Movie magic: The hotly-anticipated adaptation of the Fifty Shades of Grey book is set to hit theaters on February 13

The movie, which stars Dakota Johnson as Anastasia and Jamie Dornan as the charismatic Mr Grey, will hit theaters on February 13 next year, just in time for Valentine's Day. 

Earlier this month, British actor Jamie delivered a blow to fans when he revealed that his role in the movie  features no full-frontal nudity.

'There were contracts in place that said that viewers wouldn't be seeing my, um ...todger,' the actor told The Guardian.

'You want to appeal to as wide an audience as possible without grossing them out,' he added. 'You don't want to make something gratuitous and ugly and graphic.
