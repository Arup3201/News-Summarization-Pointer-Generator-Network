Nicolas Anelka has had the five match ban for his quenelle gesture reduced after it transpired he missed two games at West Bromwich Albion before his contract was officially cancelled.

The 35-year-old, who is waiting to play for Mumbai City in the inaugural Indian Super League, was punished by the FA when his celebration following a goal in the 3-3 draw at West Ham in December last year was deemed to be anti-Semitic.

Anelka protested his innocence claiming it was merely an appreciation of French comedian Dieudonne M'bala M'bala who used the expression in his shows.

Nicolas Anelka was banned for five matches by the FA in February for making a quenelle gesture in a Premier League clash for West Brom at West Ham last December

However, that failed to convince the FA and West Bromwich Albion. He was fined £80,000 and banned for five games with Albion ultimately sacking him for gross misconduct in March after he tweeted he was to cancel his contract for being asked to curb his behaviour.

Yet the two week notice period that Albion served on Anelka subsequently also allowed him to miss two games which have now been counted as part of his ban.

On arriving as one of Mumbai's marquee signings, the FA had asked FIFA and the Indian Federation to uphold their decision but Anelka's representatives have successfully challenged the length of the ban and he is now due to miss just the first three games of the season which kicks off on Sunday with Mumbai facing Atletico de Kolkata.

Mumbai manager Peter Reid said: 'Nicolas has always protested that his actions were misunderstood and underlined throughout that he is not a racist. He is pivotal to our plans so it's good news for Mumbai and the Indian Super League.'

Meanwhile, Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’.

Organisers hope this is the start of a new dawn in India with the launch of the high-profile ISL and the country hosting the Fifa U17 World Cup in 2017.

The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public.

Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them.

The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country.

Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price.

‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’

‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added.

Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win.

‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively.

Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy

‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy.

‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’

Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning.

‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’

India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion  by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James.

Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur.

Duleep, from Kochi, studied in England in 2011 and played for semi-pro side East Manchester who play in the Premier Division of the FBT Manchester Football League.

‘I was stunned to see Sachin at the hotel lobby in the morning,’ said Duleep. ‘I couldn’t say a word when he conveyed his best wishes to me and tears trickled down from my eyes. Sachin asked me to calm down. It feels like a dream.’

David James said: ‘He was superb against us in that practice game. Soon after the match I said that we could make use of this guy.’
