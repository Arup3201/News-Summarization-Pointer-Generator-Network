Which states strike fear in the heart of every motorist for having the least skilled, most distracted drivers on the road?New data from CarInsuranceComparison.com used statistics from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the National Motorists Association and Mothers Against Drink Driving to rank America's drivers, state by state.And the winner of the dubious honor of America's worst drivers?

State by state: Louisiana, in red, ranked the worst state for driving and Vermont in green was the best. The lighter the state, the better the drivers

For the second year running, Louisiana took out the title, finishing in the top five for three of the five categories used as scoring criteria.

The categories are: fatality rates per 100 million vehicle miles traveled, failure to obey traffic signals and seatbelt laws, drunk driving, tickets issued for speeding and careless driving.

States were ranked for each category, then the rankings added up to one total score - the higher the score, the worse the driving.

Worst drivers: Louisiana's drivers scored in the top five for failure to obey, tickets issued, and careless driving

Louisiana scored in the top five for failure to obey, tickets issued, and careless driving and came in with a total of 220.

South Carolina was the second-worst state for drivers, followed by Mississippi, Texas, Alabama and Florida.

Missouri and North Carolina tied for seventh place and Montana then North Dakota rounded out the top 10.

The country's best driving occurs in the state of Vermont, which finished with a total of 48.

Staying alive: Montana received the highest score for drink driving in the country

Jeffrey Crews, vice president of CarInsuranceComparison.com, says the ranking generates lots of debate. 'There are several reasons for that,' he told USA Today.

'One, it's the holiday season. People are traveling, and that comes into play. Plus, this is something that always comes up. Somebody is always saying, "This is a horrible state to drive in."And they can take this and say 'I told you so.'"

'Plus, people use it as a little prod to kind of jab at each other,' he said.
