The Internal Revenue Service has paid out 
more than $110 billion in tax credits over the past decade to people who
didn't qualify for them, a Treasury report has revealed.

The Earned Income Tax Credits 
were intended for poor working families but the report showed that one in five dollars paid out under the scheme was given to people who didn't deserve them.

In a statement, IRS inspector 
general J. Russell George, who wrote the report released on Tuesday, called it 'disturbing' that more than $11 billion in improper payments were being handed out each year.

'The IRS must do a better job of reining in improper payments in this and in other programs,' he said.

Using IRS statistics, the 
inspector general's report provides an estimated range of improper EITC 
payments from 2003 through 2012. The report says the IRS paid out at 
least $110.8 billion in improper payments during the period, and perhaps
as much as $132.6 billion.

The IRS says it is impossible to know
the exact amount of improper EITC payments without auditing all 27 
million taxpayers who received them, which isn't feasible.

The 
amount of improper payments grew during the recent economic slump, 
hitting at least $15.3 billion in 2010, the report said.

For 2012, the 
improper payments totaled between $11.6 billion and $13.6 billion.

IRS
efforts to pay out the right amount are hampered by unscrupulous tax preparers as well as honest 
families that have trouble figuring out how to calculate the complicated
credit, the report said.

'The IRS appreciates the inspector 
general's acknowledgement of all our work to implement processes that 
identify and prevent improper EITC payments,' the IRS said in a 
statement.

The Earned Income Tax Credits - one of the nation's largest anti-poverty programs - are intended to transfer money to the working poor through the tax system.

The 
credit is attractive because, if it is larger than your total income tax
bill, the IRS will pay you the difference. This is especially helpful 
to low-income families because many pay little or no federal income tax.

Families
earn the credits by working and earning money, though there are income 
limits. The size of the credit depends on your income and the number of 
children you have.

This year, a married couple with three or more
children can earn up to $51,567 and still qualify for the credit.

A 
married couple with two children can earn up to $48,378 and still 
qualify, according to the IRS.

The maximum credit this year is 
$6,044 for families with three or more children. The maximum credit for 
families with two children is $5,372.

'Every year, the IRS conducts 500,000 EITC audits as part of a
broader enforcement strategy, and EITC claims are twice as likely to be
audited as other tax returns.'

The agency said it prevents 'nearly $4 billion in improper claims each year and is committed to 
continuing to work to reduce improper claims'.

The EITC is one of
the nation's largest anti-poverty programs. In 2011, more than 27 
million families received nearly $62 billion in credits.

The 
credit is attractive because, if it is larger than your total income tax
bill, the IRS will pay you the difference. This is especially helpful 
to low-income families because many pay little or no federal income tax.

It is popular with many 
lawmakers who say itâ€™s an effective 
anti-poverty tool that rewards people who work.

But it also makes the credit more susceptible to fraud.

'Refundable
tax credits are a nightmare to administer and lead to far too much of 
the American people's money going out to those who aren't eligible,' 
said Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the top Republican on the Senate Finance 
Committee.

'That the IRS can't figure out how to rein in the improper 
Earned Income Tax Credit payments doesn't bode well for the $1.1 
trillion in ObamaCare subsidies.'

Additionally, the IRS has not established 
annual targets for reducing the payments, which is required by law.
