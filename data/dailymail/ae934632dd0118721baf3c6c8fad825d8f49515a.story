Matthew Amroliwala found himself in the 
uncomfortable position of admitting he was at fault

As a Crimewatch presenter, he is used to hearing from the victims of crooks and conmen.

But when one viewer contacted the show, Matthew Amroliwala found himself in the uncomfortable position of admitting he was the culprit.

While looking through Crimewatch correspondence, the BBC journalist was confronted with a text from his former window cleaner demanding payment.

It said: ‘I’m Matthew Amroliwala’s window cleaner. He’s moved and he owes me £20.’

Mr Amroliwala, 50, was quick to admit his guilt, according to The Guardian newspaper.

He told colleagues: ‘Rather than risk being on the Wanted board I’ve paid!’

Until moving house recently, Mr Amroliwala lived in Haringey, north London, with his wife Jackie and four children.

The presenter joined Crimewatch in 2008 as part of a revamp of the BBC1 show following the departure of Fiona Bruce.

Co-hosting it alongside Kirsty Young and Martin Bayfield, he presents the ‘How They Were Caught’ section, explaining solved cases.

He also gives updates on previous cases covered by Crimewatch.

On top of his Crimewatch duties, Mr Amroliwala presents for the BBC News Channel and reads BBC1’s weekend news bulletins.

The former foreign correspondent presented during the London July 7 bomb attacks in 2005, and has reported from Northern Ireland and from Bosnia during the Balkans conflict.

First broadcast in 1984, Crimewatch reconstructs major unsolved crimes to help gather more information from witnesses.

Working closely with police forces the BBC1 show’s public appeals boast an impressive crime-solving rate, with a third of cases featured leading to an arrest and one in five leading to conviction.

Some of the show’s most famous solved crimes include the murder of schoolgirl Sarah Payne in 2000 and the murder of two-year-old Jamie Bulger in 1993.

In 1999, Crimewatch was engulfed in tragedy when the programme’s presenter Jill Dando was murdered by an unidentified gunman outside her home in Fulham, west London.

A BBC spokesman declined to comment.
