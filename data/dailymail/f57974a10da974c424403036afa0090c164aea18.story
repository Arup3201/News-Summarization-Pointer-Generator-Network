Pepe Mel issued the ultimatum that only wholesale changes at West Bromwich Albion will keep him at the club, after they lost a third match in a row to end the season crawling to survival.

Mel will know in the next 48 hours whether he will remain in charge to oversee those changes when he is called into a meeting with chairman Jeremy Peace.

This home defeat by Stoke was a limp end to a dismal campaign.

Mel blew kisses to the home fans who waited around after the final whistle for their end-of-season awards presentation.

Although barely anyone hung around to see, they looked like kisses goodbye.

Mel
 said afterwards: ‘I’m going to have to listen to the chairman and find 
out what he wants for the future, 10 players are out of contract and 
we’ll need eight or nine to come in.

‘West Brom still have time to decide whether they want next season to be as full of as many problems as this one.

‘We
 have to ask why West Brom had so many problems this year; three 
different head coaches, different players. We have to resolve this in 
the summer.’

They were 
behind after 22 minutes when Marko Arnautovic dribbled into the box on 
the left and sent in a low cross which Gareth McAuley side-footed 
accurately into the bottom left corner of his own goal.

But the home side struck back in the second half.

On
 56 minutes makeshift full back Craig Dawson sent in a low ball from the right 
flank which evaded everyone apart from Stephane Sessegnon, who steered 
the ball back in the direction it came from and into the bottom right 
corner.

West Brom fans held banners during the game calling for 'Justice for Jeff'.

Former Baggies striker Jeff Astle died aged 59 of degenerative brain disease in 2002 and the coroner ruled that successive mental traumas – caused by heading heavy leather footballs when he was a player – caused the damage.

Fans were campaigning for research into brain injuries and the heading of older heavy footballs.

West Brom’s Youssouf
 Mulumbu struck the inside of the left post with a half-volley from the 
right and Stoke’s Arnautovic hit the outside of the right with his low 
curler from 18 yards.

But, 
reflecting West Brom’s season rather well, the home side crumbled to an 
87th-minute strike by substitute Charlie Adam, who fired into the bottom
 right corner from the edge of the box.

There
 are clearly issues at the club. Sessegnon and Mulumbu went straight 
down the tunnel and refused to join the rest of the team in their lap of
 appreciation at the end of the match.

For Stoke the 50 points they reached to finish ninth is their highest ever return in the Premier League era.

Manager Mark Hughes said: ‘To get 50 points on the board in the hardest league in football is a huge achievement for Stoke.

‘That
 doesn’t happen by chance, it doesn’t happen overnight. It’s about doing
 work on the training ground and recognising what’s required.’
