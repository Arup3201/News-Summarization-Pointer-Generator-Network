ADEBAYOR LEFT OUT IN THE COLD

Emmanuel Adebayor could only make the Tottenham bench on Wednesday night but it’s understood that the Togo striker is one of a number of players whose name has cropped up in discussions between Spurs and Paris Saint-Germain.

Adebayor captained his team in last week’s first leg but was jeered by a section of supporters when he was replaced by Roberto Soldado in the second half.

The 30-year-old former Arsenal and Manchester City striker has been kept out of the first-team this season by the emergence of Harry Kane and Spurs might be prepared to consider letting him join PSG on loan for the rest of the season. The Qatar-backed French champions could certainly afford his £140,000-a-week wages.

DE GIROLAMO REFUSING NEW DEAL 

Sheffield may have to consider selling Diego de Girolamo before the transfer window closes if the teenage striker does not agree to sign a new contract at Bramall Lane.

De Girolamo, 19, scored his first goal for the club in the FA Cup draw with Preston at the weekend but is refusing to sign a new deal. His current contract runs out in the summer, when United will only receive £200,000 in compensation, and there has been interest from Juventus and several Premier League clubs.

Manager Nigel Clough tried to play down the issue in his programme notes, saying: ‘We are relaxed about his contract situation and remain optimistic he will make the right decision and stay with us.’

WHY ALWAYS SABELLA? 

Wednesday's match programme included a fascinating article on Alex Sabella, a one-time Sheffield United player and now better known as the former head coach of Argentina who led his country to the World Cup final in Brazil last summer.

Among the documents printed with the article were Sabella’s transfer agreement from River Plate in 1978, his national insurance card, a fixed penalty from South Yorkshire police for failing to display a tax disc, and a bill from the club of £2,285.77 for household goods including a cooker, carpets and fridge.

DON'T STOP BELIEVING

Sheffield United captain Michael Doyle picked his favourite three songs to start the pre-match soundtrack: The Who’s “Baba O’Riley”, Billy Ocean’s “Red Light” and “Don’t Stop Believing” by Journey, which seemed appropriate, and he insisted was popular back home. At least the Dubliner’s choice meant there was still room for improvement once the DJ moved onto Sheffield music.

BRAYFORD BEARD BACK AT BRAMALL

The home team paraded three new signings in a pre-match snow-flurry and declared the future to be bright. John Brayford, signed from Cardiff on a permanent deal after a successful loan deal last season, John Coutts and Kieron Freeman, both from Nigel Clough’s former club Derby. The Bramall Lane crowd were thrilled to see Brayford still sporting the strong beard which afforded him cult status during a loan spell last season.

WALK DOWN MEMORY LANE

Warm applause before kick-off from the home crowd for Spurs full-back Kyle Walker who left in 2009 after emerging through the youth ranks, although he was almost released by the Blades at 16, when he was the last of 14 to be awarded a scholarship.
