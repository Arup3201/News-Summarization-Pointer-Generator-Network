A New Zealand tattoo artist's act of kindness has captured the hearts of thousands of social media users. 

Jason Ward, a tattooist at Muscle And Ink Tattoo in Hamilton, New Zealand, has proved it's the small things that matter, after a photo was posted to Facebook showing him applying a temporary tattoo to a woman with Down Syndrome. 

Suzie Barry comes in to Jason's parlour every Friday and he preps her skin as if she were to receive a full tattoo.

Jason Ward, a tattooist at Muscle And Ink Tattoo in Hamilton, New Zealand, has proved it's the small things that matter, after a photo was posted to Facebook showing him applying a temporary tattoo to a woman with Down Syndrome

However, every week, Jason applies a stick-on tattoo to the woman's skin, playing along with her as if he were applying a real tattoo, even using a spray gun and applying plastic gloves.

Jason treats Suzie as if she were a real client, sitting her down at the tattooist's table, stencilling in her skin and giving her the full tattoo experience. 

Suzie brings her own stick-on tattoos in to Jason's tattoo parlour and Jason does not charge her for his work.

According to the 44-year-old father-of-five, Suzie has been coming into the parlour every Friday for the past four months.

Speaking to the New Zealand Herald, Jason said that it started off as a bit of a laugh but as time has gone by, the tattoo artist has tried to get her talking.

'Why would you say no? You should treat everybody the same,'  

'I didn't even know her name until Monday, when everything went nuts on the internet but I still don't know a lot about her,' he said. 

In a Facebook comment, Jason said: 'I take 5 minutes out of my day to keep her smiling,'

'My everyday goal is to make someone smile and have a great day, as I am just an average guy doing average things that make me and my family happy. Thank you to those who have kind words to say about this, that makes me happy.' He said. 

The elderly woman attends a day facility through the Intellectual Disability Empowerment in Action.

Once Facebook user said: 'If only there were more people that show that level of respect the world may not be such a retched place to be sometimes,'

Another said: 'Wish there were more kind-hearted people in the world.'

Over 177,000 people have liked the Facebook post, with 55,000 alone liking Jason's comment on the picture. 

'To take time out of your busy day just to help this lady is amazing. Keep up the good work. I wish there were more people in this world like you,' a woman said. 

Jason has touched many people's hearts with his gesture, with one man claiming he will reap rewards for his kindness. 

'What a great guy! I have a sister with Downs Syndrome. It always makes me happy to see good people take the time out to make someone feel special, even if it causes a slight slow down. Keep on it man. You're a good person.' the poster said.
