Authorities are trying to identify a mystery thrill-seeker filmed risking his life by bodyboarding down the side of a 50ft dam.

The man asked a friend to film him as he clambered onto his board before launching himself over the edge of Porth Reservoir near Newquay, Cornwall.

A video clip of the dangerous stunt shows him rapidly sliding down the side of the 1960-built structure into a large pool of water.

Foolhardy: The man perches on the edge of the reservoir as he prepares to launch himself down the side

South West Lakes Trust, which owns the reservoir, slammed the bodyboarder's antics

Aside from the risk of injury from the fall, reservoirs can be deep, deceptively cold and have high sides which can make getting out difficult

South West Lakes Trust, which owns the reservoir, said it was unaware when the 15-second clip was filmed.

The company slammed the bodyboarder's antics and has stepped up patrols along the dam.

They also warned the mystery thrillseeker could be breaking the law.

A spokesman said: 'We work closely with South West Lakes Trust to make our reservoirs accessible and pleasant for people to visit.'

Launch: The man is launched over the water at the end of the drop

The thrill-seeker may have carried out a criminal offence

Crackdown: The owners of the reservoir are increasing security patrols

He added: 'However, we would remind visitors that these are operational sites with hidden dangers.

'Every summer, we remind people not to swim in our reservoirs because there are no lifeguarding facilities, they are very deep - often with steep sides - and can be extremely cold.

'Reports of dangerous activities at our reservoirs are extremely worrying.

'We are increasing security patrols in the area.'

Looming: The 1960s concrete wall is 50ft tall and is covered in what looks like algae
