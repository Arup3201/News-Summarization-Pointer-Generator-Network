Jose Mourinho says the amount of jobs football generates for the community is justification for the astronomical wages paid to its superstar players.

The Chelsea boss was announced on Tuesday as a UN ambassador against hunger as part of the World Food Programme, with his first call of duty set to be a trip to Liberia to witness the ravages of hunger first-hand.

Mourinho said the sheer weight of numbers inspired his involvement with the cause.

Jobs for the boys: Mourinho says high wages for footballers are justified due to the jobs the sport creates

'In the end of the day this is more important than football,' he told ITV News London.

'You’re not aware of the cruelty and the reality of the numbers. When you have the documents, when you see the numbers, they turn your head completely around.'

Mourinho is referring to figures such as the 842 million people - 66 million of them school-age children - in the world who go hungry every day.

When asked how one can justify the wages involved in football when so many around the world don't have food on the table, he put his hands up.

'I don’t run away from it,' he said. 'I justify that. I try and one of the reasons I find to justify is that football gives jobs to thousands of people.

'Football is not about managers and players. It gives jobs directly and indirectly related to the football industry.

'There are jobs and jobs and families and children and mouths and football becomes a big industry.'

Wages for players and staff in the Premier League hit a record £1.8 billion in 2012-13.

Despite Chelsea's January transfer spending, the Blues have endured a trophy-less season.

But 
Mourinho insists the campaign cannot be written off as a major 
disappointment, insisting that solid foundations have been laid for next
 season.

'It’s not such a big disappointment because in the beginning that was not the objective.

'The
 objective was to start building a new team. We understand now we have 
to think about improvement for the next year because we want Chelsea to 
become what Chelsea was in the last decade.'
