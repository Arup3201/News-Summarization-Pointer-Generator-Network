The founder of Lululemon Athletica Chip Wilson, who resigned as chairman last year after suggesting women's fat thighs created problems with a line of his yoga pants, has stepped down from the company's board.

Wilson, who established the Canadian company in 1998, upset customers during an interview in November 2013 when he said 'some women's bodies' as part of the reason why the product was recalled earlier for being too sheer.

Other problems included pilling, holes, and seams coming apart. Those problems were expensive to fix.

Controverisal: Lululemon founder Chip Wilson, pictured with his wife Shannon, said that some women's bodies 'don't work' for yoga pants. A year after resigning as chairman he has stepped down from the board

He told Bloomberg TV: 'Frankly, some women’s bodies just don’t actually work.'

When speaking about how some customers' complained about the pants' fabric pilling, Mr Wilson continued: 'It’s really about the rubbing through the thighs, how much pressure is there over a period of time and how they much they use it.'

The founder's remarks caused Bloomberg TV host Trish Regan to cut in and ask: 'Interesting, not every woman can wear a Lululemon yoga pant?'

Mr Wilson responded: 'No, I think they can. I just think it’s how you use it.' 

Following that incident, he agreed to step down as chairman but had remained a board member.

Wilson had left Lululemon in 2012 to take a sabbatical in Australia. At the time he had served as chief innovation and branding officer. He was asked by the company's board to come back in the spring of 2013.

In mid-2014, Wilson pushed for changes to the company's board of directors, In August, Wilson reached a deal to sell about half of his shares in Lululemon to investment firm Advent International for $845 million in exchange for Advent receiving two seats on the board.

Wilson still owns about 10.3 million shares, or 7.8 percent, of Lululemon, according to FactSet, a stake worth more than $650 million at Monday's stock price.

Wilson said in a statement Monday that it was the right time to step down from the board. He plans to help his wife and son with their new business, Kit & Ace, which sells machine washable cashmere clothing and other apparel and accessories.

Lululemon's shares fell 91 cents to $65.33 in morning trading. The shares are up more than 40 percent over the past year.
