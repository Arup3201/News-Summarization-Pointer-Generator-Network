Take Back The Metro aims to end sexual harassment on the French underground

Dressed in pink sparkly wigs and making a lot of noise, the attention-grabbing group of women boarding the Metro could almost have been mistaken for a boisterous hen party.

However these ladies had a much more serious agenda when they took to the public transport system in France's capital.

Dozens of members of the feminist group Osez le Féminisme stormed the capital's subway system in a 'Take Back The Metro' demonstration against violence against women and sexual aggression on the public transport.

Their aim is to raise awareness of the increasing levels of intimidation against women on the Metro and to ask the RATP, the French public transportation operator, to act to reduce it. 

Speaking to RFI a spokesperson for Ozez le Féminisme (which translates as Dare Feminism) explained: 'When you are a woman on the subway in Paris, you are often the victim of different types of sexual aggression.

'We have done a study in the Metro this summer in Paris, and the study showed that three out of four women were adapting their behaviour or their clothes and their way of dressing when they were going to take the Metro.'

The group pasted hundreds of posters around the Metro during the demonstration, which aim to bring attention to the issue and 'expose the insecurity women feel on public transport.' 

'Spreading your legs is not necessary,' one sign reads. 'It is preferable to keep your legs together. Testicles are not made of crystal and will not explode.You can thus leave more space for your neighbours. You will no longer inflict this visual pollution on them.'

Signs posted by the group Osez le Féminisme on the Metro include ones that urge 'In case of sexual harassing or sexual touches: shout, ask for help, strike'

'Spreading your legs is not necessary,' one sign reads. 'It is preferable to keep your legs together'

Other signs say: 'In case of sexual harassing or sexual touches: shout, ask for help, strike,' and 'When the train is crowded, do not take advantage of it to rub yourself against your neighbour.' 

Unsurprisingly the posters have prompted a strong response on social media, with thousands tweeting with the hash tag #TakeBackTheMetro and sharing images of the signs dotted all over public transport.

'#TakeBackTheMetro encourages women to reclaim public transport' one user Tweets 

'I have never regretted leaving Paris but that was before #TakeBackTheMetro which I would love to be a park of,' one user Tweets.

'A campaign that could be replicated everywhere, RE: sexual harassment on public transport. #TakeBackTheMetro,' another posts.

Take back the Metro is based on the hugely successful US organisation Take Back The Night, which fights against violence in all forms. 

The organisation, which has spread across Europe since it's origin in the 1970s, organises marches and sit-ins aimed at ending sexual and domestic violence.
