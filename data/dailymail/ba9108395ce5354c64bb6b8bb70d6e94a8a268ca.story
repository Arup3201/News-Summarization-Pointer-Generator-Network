Last week they were joined by Jimmy Carr and his partner but last night, Princess Beatrice and long-term boyfriend Dave Clark flew solo for a romantic dinner date.

The young royal and her boyfriend enjoyed a low-key evening at La Petite Maison, a French restaurant in the heart of Mayfair.

The 25-year-old, who is making a name for herself as quite the fashionista, looked sophisticated and chic in a fitted black dress, which she teamed with a tailored monochrome blazer.

Keeping things simple, she opted for black court shoes and a small black clutch bag.

The raven-haired royal looked in good spirits as she and Dave giggled on their departure from the trendy restaurant.

Last night marks just one of many social events the Princess has attended recently.

In one of 
the more surprising buddy-ups of recent times, Princess Beatrice enjoyed a 
double date last Wednesday with funny man Jimmy Carr.

The two apparent pals dined out at exclusive London restaurant Zuma with their respective other halves.

 was accompanied by his partner Karoline Copping.

Regularly
 seen out at celebrity hot spots and rubbing shoulders with the A-list, 
Beatrice has just returned from the star studded second wedding of model
 and socialite Poppy Delevingne to James Cook in Morocco.

The young royal joined other guests including
 models Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May 
Jagger, actress Sienna Miller and fashion designer Matthew Williamson.
