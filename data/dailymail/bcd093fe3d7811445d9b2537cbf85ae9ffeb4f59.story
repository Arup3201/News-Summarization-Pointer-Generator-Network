Three reportedly inexperienced abalone divers died after jumping into rough seas off the coast of northern California on Sunday. 

The men were part of a group of five divers from the East Coast and San Francisco. Ten friends, including the dead men, had rented a house on Caspar Cove 160 miles north of San Francisco to hunt for abalone, a rare and expensive mollusk that is prized as a delicacy.

The Santa Rosa Press Democrat reports that the accident in Mendocino County is the deadliest single incident involving abalone divers in recent memory.

Witnesses said at least some of the men appeared to be inexperienced abalone divers who chose rough, choppy waters near several dangerous rock outcroppings to dive - instead of entering the water at the soft beach nearby.

Firefighters said the men dove into water in Caspar Cove and found themselves immediately in trouble. An off-duty firefighter who happened to be fishing nearby spotted the men and called for help.

The three men who drowned were overcome by the churning water and crushed against the sharp rocks on shore. 

Rescuers managed to pull the two survivors and one of the dead men from the water immediately after arriving on scene. 

A Sonoma County Sheriff’s Office helicopter plucked the second victim from the sea and brought him to shore.  

Ten friends from the East Coast and San Francisco rented a house on Caspar Cove to dive for abalone, locals said. Five of them went out on Sunday - three died 

Firefighters performed CPR on the two drowned men on the beach as his horrified friends watched - but both were pronounced dead on Sunday afternoon. 

The third man's body was found after a five-hour search that involved aircraft and boats from several fire departments and sheriff's offices, as well as the US Coast Guard. 

 He was smashed against rocks in a cove, which required rescuers to hoist his body up the cliff with a winch because they couldn't get to him by water. 

Local authorities say the abalone season, which started April 1, is always marred by several rescues and often a few death.

Abalone, a snail-like mollusk with a beautiful shiny shell, sells for up to $70 a pound.
