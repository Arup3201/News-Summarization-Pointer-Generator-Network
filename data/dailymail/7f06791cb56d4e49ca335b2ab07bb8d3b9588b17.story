Honour: Shadow Defence Minister Jim Murphy has called on the nation to mark Armed Forces Day

The country reacted with collective revulsion at the brutal murder of Drummer Lee Rigby. A young hero whose life was stolen.

The barbaric act of terror, so graphic on our TV screens, will not go unpunished and nor will it be forgotten.

The family of that young, distinguished, slain soldier will be in the thoughts of everyone who has a heart and in the prayers of each of us who has a faith.

So how should we respond? Politicians shouldn’t change our foreign or defence policies.

A tiny minority in our country will act out a malevolent revenge which the police will deal with.

But for everyone else we have a different responsibility.

Our reaction is one of the things that the extremists hate about us.

It is that British spirit of resolve, solidarity, openness and justice that should triumph.

Our nation is a remarkable blend of modernity and enduring institutions including the Monarchy, NHS and the BBC.

But nothing captures that spirit more exquisitely than our Armed Forces. They are people from  every corner of our islands, all with their own histories, many placing  a personal faith in their own God.

I remember a visit to Afghanistan when I met some of the many  hundreds of British Muslims,  patriots one and all, serving in Her  Majesty’s Forces.

Wherever they come from, whether they pray from a Bible, Koran or Torah or not at all, they all serve with one thing in common – a determination to keep our country safe and free.

In our prayers: Drummer Lee Rigby with his wife Rebecca on their wedding day

Response: Mr Murphy says Armed Forces Day on June 29 is a chance to demonstrate the strength of unity between the Services and our country in the wake of Drummer Rigby's death

Their acts of collective courage and individual ingenuity in the dust and danger of battlefields overseas is  awe-inspiring.

We
all have it in us to celebrate their quiet dignity. We can give to one 
of our great military charities by all means but let’s do something 
else  as well.

Armed Forces Day on June 29 is a chance to demonstrate 
the strength of unity between the Services and our country.

Hundreds of floral tributes were left in tribute to Lee Rigby yesterday at the spot where he was killed.

Union and St George’s flags were draped among the bouquets, along with Manchester United football shirts, recognising his support for the club.

In one touching message, a picture of Drummer Rigby and his two-year-old son Jack was pinned to the railings with the caption: ‘Daddy and his little soldier! R.I.P Lee’.

A young woman wearing a green hoodie sobbed and wiped tears from her eyes  as she arrived to read the messages of condolence.

She was with more than a dozen friends and family members, many visibly upset.

A peaceful march was held nearby by members of the Nigerian community to distance themselves from the two suspects, whose roots lie in the West African country. 

Scores of motorcyclists supporting the Help For Heroes charity also rode past the scene in a show of support.

I was troubled at suggestions that members of the Armed Forces should not wear their uniforms in public in response to Wednesday’s atrocity.

In the chaotic aftermath this may have been momentarily necessary, but a longer-term shift towards our Forces and veterans being invisible on British streets would be the wrong response.

David Cameron’s advice after Wednesday was to ‘act normally’.  I agree. Up to a point. Everyday life must continue, but a haunting act demands an extraordinary reaction.

The response to dramatic events can be as important as the events themselves. Londoners making their way in to work after the 7/7 terror attacks sticks in all our minds.

An overwhelming public show of support for our Armed Forces would do the same. That is why the forthcoming Armed Forces Day can mark a moment of defiance and celebration: defiance against our aggressors, celebration of who our Armed Forces are and what they achieve.

As long as the security advice is 
clear then on June 29 members of Her Majesty’s Armed Forces could be 
encouraged to publicly wear their uniform even if off-duty.

Veterans of all generations could wear
their medals or military attire. And we, all of us, can do something 
important that will take only three seconds. Because that’s all it would
take to say ‘thank you’ to a member of our Armed Forces.

We
don’t just want to see uniformed personnel in ceremonial parades; we 
want to see them on our streets and in shops, at fairs and fetes, on 
public transport and as part of our communities.

We all know that during
the 1970s and 1980s the Forces were advised not to wear uniforms off 
base because of IRA/INLA terrorism. That was relaxed after the  Belfast 
Agreement.

In memory: Mourners and well-wishers left flowers at the scene in Woolwich where Drummer Rigby tragically died

Sea of flowers: Floral tributes outside the main gate of the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, south-east London

Outpouring of grief: Thousands of wellwishers have paid their respects where the young father was brutally slain

But we can do more than that. Polling shows nearly two-thirds of the public consider there is too little  recognition for the Armed Forces.

At the same time more than one-in-five members of the Forces said they had experienced abuse while wearing their uniform in public in the last  five years. It is unacceptable to abuse those who serve, but the well of inherent support is an opportunity for us now to stand up and be counted ourselves.

It is less than a week since the  horror in Woolwich and just over a month until Armed Forces Day. But we should all ask ourselves: ‘What am I personally going to do in memory of all of those who have been lost, including Lee Rigby, or injured, or who still serve today?’

This year don’t leave it to someone else to celebrate Armed  Forces Day.
