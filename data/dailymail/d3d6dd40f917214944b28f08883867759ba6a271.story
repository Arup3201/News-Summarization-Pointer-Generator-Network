A U.S. army officer accused of sex offenses in three states is to be allowed to use an 'evil twin' defense to try and escape being jailed for life.

Lt Aaron Lucas plans to blame his identical twin brother for the crimes.

The artillery officer, who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor, is accused of being a sexual predator who roamed the towns near his military base in Fort Carson, Colorado, trying to abduct and assault young girls.

Decorated artillery officer Lt Aaron Lucas of Fort Carson, Colorado, plans to blame his identical twin brother Brain for a series of sex offenses

He was arrested last year in connection with a child abduction and an attempted child abduction over the summer.

But detectives realized the 32-year-old matched the description of a suspect in as many as 11 attempted abductions.

DNA taken from an attempted abduction in Colorado matched samples taken from crime scenes in Alabama in 2007 and Texas two years later.

Lawyers for the officer claim the DNA was from his twin brother Brian, who lived in both states at the time of the attacks. As identical twins the brothers share the same DNA.

Brian Lucas has not been charged and could not be located for comment, reports the Colorado Sprngs Gazette. It said Brian Lucas had previous addresses in Madison and in Texas.

Aaron Lucas' attorneys say an unidentified third man is responsible for the Colorado assaults.

El Paso County prosecutors said the Colorado victims' ages ranged from six to nine and that they were targeted at random in Colorado Springs and nearby Fountain by a man who tried to coax them into sex with promises of money and ice cream.

Prosecutors contend three girls were assaulted during the encounters.

The incidents began shortly after Aaron Lucas' arrival at Fort Carson with the 1st Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division.

A Colorado Springs police detective, Fred Walker, has testified the assaults stopped while Aaron Lucas was deployed to Afghanistan.

Lucas received 
the Bronze Star, the fourth-highest honor given to members of the 
military, for valor during a deployment to Afghanistan.

In his four years of active duty, Lucas amassed a glowing military resume including 10 medals and awards.

He is being held at El Paso County jail on $1.2 million bond. He goes on trial in January and could face life behind bars if convicted.

A judge in Colorado Springs, Colorado, has said she will allow Lucas to blame his twin brother.

District Judge David Shakes ruled Friday it would be 'inappropriate' to bar 1st Lt. Aaron Lucas' lawyers from presenting his identical twin as an alternate suspect given the siblings' shared DNA.

'Whether it's persuasive or not that's not my role,' the judge said. 'It's the role of the jury.'

Karen Steinhauser, a criminal defense attorney and adjunct law professor at the University of Denver, told The Associated Press such an argument is rare.

'I have never seen it, ever,' she said. 'The only time I have seen it was on Law And Order: SVU,' the television show.
