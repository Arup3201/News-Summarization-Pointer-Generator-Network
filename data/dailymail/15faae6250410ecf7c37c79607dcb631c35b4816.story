The wife of a man who died in the Caribbean last year after being thrown from a speeding power boat taken out by Stew Leonard Sr., is suing the grocery chain tycoon and his son.

Barbara Speranza is seeking 'millions of dollars' for the death of her 73-year-old husband Robert, according to the wrongful death lawsuit filed in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

It claims Leonard, who founded the Connecticut-based Stew Leonard's stores, and his son Thomas were operating the $4.6 million boat at 'high speed' in rough waters despite weather warnings.

Lawsuit: Barbara Speranza, left, has filed a lawsuit over the death of her husband Robert, right, who died after suffering brain, head and spinal damage before being thrown overboard a boat in the Caribbean

Their 'negligent and reckless' driving meant Speranza was 'violently tossed
about inside the boat' injuring his head and spine and throwing him overboard, the suit alleges, the Hartford Courant reported.

Stew Leonard Jr., who had been friends with Speranza for 40 years, had previously said that a 12 to 15 foot 'rogue 
wave' had hit the 70-foot powerboat, sweeping Speranza 
overboard.

But Mrs Speranza's lawyer Joel T. Faxon said Leonard had designed the boat, the Stew's Special, to reach 90 mph and it did not move vertically through the water at top speeds as speedboats should.

The suit alleges that Stew Leonard decided to take the boat from St. Maarten, where Mr Speranza and his wife owned a resort, to St. Thomas despite a small craft advisory warning of a hurricane.

Accused: She claims his death was caused by the reckless driving of Stew
Leonard Sr (third from left) and his son Thomas (second from 
right). Leonard Sr founded grocery store chain Stew Leonard's in 1969

'Responsible': Thomas, left, and Stew, right, allegedly decided to take the boat on a 300 mile trip between two Caribbean Islands despite a small craft advisory warning about an approaching hurricane

'First of all, he shouldn't be out there because conditions are so bad. Second, he shouldn't be out there on a 300-mile trip under those conditions,' Faxon told The Daily Weston.

He added: 'The Leonard defendants are 
responsible for Mr. Speranza's death. This lawsuit, combined with the 
inquest in Tortola, will answer the many questions that have been raised
by Bob's death at sea.

'We will seek punitive damages from
the Leonard defendants to punish them for this senseless tragedy.'

Mrs Speranza is seeking compensatory and punitive damages for the death of her husband, but Faxon would not specify the amount.

Fast: The $4.6 million 70-ft long power boat, Stew's Special, is designed to travel up to 90 mph

High life: Stew Leonard Sr, pictured aboard the boat with Sir Richard Branson, is being sued for 'millions'

'It will be several million dollars,' he told the Hartford Courant. 'Obviously he's a very wealthy man, and when 
the jury makes a decision on punitive damages they have to decide what 
amount constitutes a punishment for that person. The wealth of a 
defendant is a factor.'

Stew Leonard Sr. opened his first grocery store in Norwalk, Connecticut in 1969. It came complete with an animal farm and initially just focused on dairy.

Since, the brand has expanded to four stores in Connecticut and Yonkers, New York, as well as a spin-off store, Tom Leonard's in Virginia.

The chain is known for their meandering paths around stores, as well as mechanic, singing animals placed by entrances and aisles.

There are also games zones and petting zoos to entertain children while their parents shop.

Annual sales are around $300 million and the company employs nearly 2,000 employees.

But it was scandal hit in 1993, when Stew Leonard Sr. was convicted of committing tax fraud. He diverted more than $17 million in cash register receipts over a ten-year period, avoiding nearly $7 million in tax. He was sentenced to 52-months in jail.

Carpe Diem Three LLC, which owns the boat, is also named in the lawsuit. Stew Leonard Sr. is a member of the company, Faxon said

The three men were on board with the vessel's captain, Martijn Haasdit, when they got into trouble, previous reports claimed.

Stew Leonard Sr had recounted to the Westport News: 'The 
wave came crashing through the boat and smashed the glass of the 
10-foot-wide windshield, which is normally bulletproof.

'My son was also swept down to the back of the boat, but he was able to grab onto a railing.

'Immediately we turned the boat around to look for Bob where we saw white cushions floating in the water.

'We called in a 'mayday,' got him on 
board, and proceeded to do CPR on him for about 30 minutes, which was 
the time it took to get the boat to Tortola.

'We all worked on him, trying everything we could to resuscitate him, but to no avail.'

Before his death, the couple, who had
been married for 53 years, ran the Ocean Club, a resort on the 
Caribbean island of St. Maarten.

They moved to the island from New Haven, Connecticut. Mr Seranza had previously worked as an engineer for NASA.

But now Mrs Speranza will be forced to close the resort, Faxon claimed.

Sued: Tom Leonard, who has been named in the lawsuit along with his father and the boat's owner, opened a spinoff of the store, Tom Leonard's Farmer's Market (pictured), in Virginia in 2004

Family business: It is not the first timeStew Leonard Sr (third from left, with his family), has a run in with the law. In 1993, he pleaded guilty to a $6.7 million tax fraud and was sentenced to 52 months in jail

'I cannot run the business, I have to sell it,' he quotes her as saying. 'My life is completely turned upside down, all as consequence of a reckless decision made by Stew Leonard.'

It is not the first time Leonard Sr. has been in trouble with the law; in 1993, Leonard Sr. pleaded guilty to the largest tax fraud in state history and received a 52-month prison term.

It came after he oversaw the use of a computer software program to skim $17.1 million off the books to avoid paying $6.7 million in taxes.

A spokeswoman at Stew Leonard's told the Courant the company had no comment.
