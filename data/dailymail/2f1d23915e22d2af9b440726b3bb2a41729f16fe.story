With Scottish football being the sort of buttoned-down world in which any honestly-expressed opinion has the potential to cause offence, an outcry or vows of vengeance, some might have expected Ronny Deila to shy away from John Guidetti’s stated ambition of winning four trophies with Celtic this season. Not a chance.

The reason Deila is so keen to make on-loan Manchester City striker Guidetti a permanent part of his plans go beyond the forward’s eye for goal – and include the cocksure confidence that makes him so positive about Celtic’s Europa League chances as well as a domestic Treble.

Thanks to the way the young Swede has ‘clicked’ at Parkhead, Deila thinks it puts the Scottish champions in a great position to land him once his City contract expires at the end of the season. And he clearly has enormous affection for a player whose self-belief is so marked that even Pierre van Hooijdonk has nodded his approval.

Asked about 22-year-old Guidetti’s targeting of three domestic trophies plus that UEFA prize, the Norwegian said: ‘I believe everything is possible. And you have to believe.

‘That is why I love Guidetti, because he believes. You can see it in his eyes when he goes on the pitch: “I’m here to score, I’m here to win.” And you can see it in the dressing room.

‘That’s why I want to keep him as a player, get his contract permanently here, because he has the values I love. He’s humble, he wants to learn, he wants to improve – and he is a winner. You can see that on the pitch.

‘I want all of our players to believe that we can win the Europa League, of course. If you don’t believe, you don’t get it – you really have to believe it, really have to fight for it.

‘I think people are different. You need different types. You can’t have 25 John Guidettis – that would be tough for a manager!

‘But it’s about the confidence you show on the pitch, the security you give to the team-mates you have. We have to create that together. This group has to commit and have a really, really strong togetherness.

‘I think that has grown over the last three or four weeks. I’ve seen them fighting for each other, developing a team where there are no stars, just hard-working players.

Ronny Deila has already begun his attempts to keep Guidetti at Celtic permanently

‘When you see the best teams in the world, they have no time for people being lazy or not doing the work. It starts with hard work, then we need skills – and Guidetti has both.’

The concern for Celtic is that Guidetti impresses at home and in the latter stages of the Europa League - assuming progress from the group stages is secured - and then jumps at another offer likely to come the way of any hot striker.

However, Deila believes that doing well in Glasgow will only enhance the player’s desire to stay in Scotland, saying: ‘I think John was at Stoke last year, he was at City and he hasn’t played first-team football for two years.

‘It’s like it has clicked between Celtic and John. One thing I know in football is that, when you are at the right club, you have to appreciate what you have.

‘You have to understand that your success is not all down to you, it’s also the environment, the club that suits you and makes the best out of you.

‘So far, we have done that with John, together with him. I think he can develop a lot, he can reach a lot of his goals here.

‘I think it’s vital for John to play. That’s important. Here, he gets the trust he needs – and he produces. He is enjoying every day.

‘If we keep getting good results, more people will come to the stadium, he’ll play in bigger games. John Guidetti will be even better.

‘We will do everything we can in our club to make him happy, so he wants to stay. His contract is running out, so there is no issue there.’

Guidetti’s arrival on deadline day was accompanied by plenty of pre-publicity about the young superstar who scored 20 goals in 23 appearances for Feyenoord before a mystery illness left him temporarily paralysed. This was a boy who, backed by an unshakeable belief in his ability and tipped to be the next Zlatan Ibrahimovic in his homeland, has never believed in false modesty.

Former Feyenoord and Celtic great van Hooikdonk recalls hearing all about the kid who turned up in Holland with no reputation – but plenty of swagger – back in 2011.

‘Guidetti was an unknown Swedish guy when he arrived at Feyenoord,’ said van Hooijdonk. ‘I’m told, from the first moment when he arrived, everyone was surprised by his behaviour. He entered the dressing-room and … let’s just say he wasn’t shy. He had a confidence and an edge to him.

Deila described Guidetti as 'a goalscorer', something that is hard to come by

‘But that was good, exactly what was needed at that time because it was a tough, tough period for Feyenoord. Guidetti then scored important goals and became a hero. He was part of a revival for Feyenoord and they finished second in the league.

‘Now he is at Celtic and I also think he arrived at the right time there. It’s not always been brilliant performances from the team so far, but Guidetti has given a little bit of a spark. His attitude has been positive and he has scored important goals.

‘His behaviour at Celtic has also been a positive, in the same way I spoke about it at Feyenoord.

‘He has the self-belief to cope with the pressure of being a striker for Celtic. I know it can be difficult. But when you start to score goals and the Celtic fans see you are giving your all for the club, then they will take you into their hearts. The Feyenoord supporters and Celtic supporters are very similar in that way.

‘Over the years, many, many top strikers have played for Celtic. Guidetti is heading in the right direction.’

Celtic’s pursuit of four trophies sees them face Partick Thistle at home on League Cup duty tomorrow night, with Deila insisting no-one in the home dressing room will take the match lightly.

The manager, who insists he never even looks at the medals he won in his playing and coaching career, said: ‘I would rather think of what I created with others. That’s what drives me, to create and to have moments and experiences together.

‘When you do that well, you get trophies. It’s the same here, we need to create something good. If we do that, over time we will also have trophies. We really want it, I really want it.

‘We want to win everything and the League Cup is the first trophy available. That starts on Wednesday against Partick Thistle.’
