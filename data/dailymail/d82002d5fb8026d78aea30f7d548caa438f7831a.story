Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has revealed in a dramatic u-turn to previous claims.

Only on Saturday had Ms Bishop said there were still no plans to put boots on the ground in Iraq.

'We have reached an agreement for a legal framework and now it will be a matter for our military when our special forces will be deployed,' Ms Bishop said on Sunday.

The Foreign Minister spoke at the conclusion of a two-day trip to Baghdad after meeting with senior Iraqi officials.

Australia will send its special forces into Iraq to fight against Islamic State, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said

Prime Minister Tony Abbott explained on Wednesday that 200 members of the special forces had been waiting in the United Arab Emirates since mid-September because Baghdad had not offered them formal legal protections.

Mr Abbott said he wanted the same indemnity from prosecution under Iraqi law for the SAS troops as American troops already had in Iraq.

Australian special forces will be used in Iraq to 'advise and assist the government of Iraq in building up the capacity of the Iraqi security forces,' Ms Bishop said.

Australian launched their first air strikes against Islamic State targets inside the country earlier this month as part of the U.S.-led coalition.

However, on Saturday Ms Bishop first said in a press conference with her counterpart Ibrahim al-Jaafari that Australia would not be deploying soldiers on foot in the country.

'We've not been asked and we've not offered to, so I do not envisage that being part of our arrangements with Iraq,' she told reporters  in Baghdad.

Ms Bishop (pictured with Mr al-Jaafari right) previously insisted there are no plans for Australian troops on the ground in Iraq

'We will only provide assistance at the invitation of and with the consent of the Iraqi government.' 

Australia has already sent six F/A-18F Super Hornet jet fighters to the country. 

The fighter jets were now flying almost daily combat missions against Islamic State targets in northern Iraq, Mr Abbott said.

Iraqi officials have repeatedly said that while the warplanes were welcome, foreign troops on the ground in their country were not.

Abbott said that objection to foreign troops was not an obstacle to the Australian military playing an advising and assisting role for Iraqi security forces.

Ms Bishop previously said at the press conference in Baghdad (pictured) that Australia had not offered or been invited to bring in ground troops to Iraq
