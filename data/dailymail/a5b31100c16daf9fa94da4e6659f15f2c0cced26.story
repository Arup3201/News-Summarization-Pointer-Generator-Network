Hakim Berkani, 44, was hailed a hero after revealing that wardens are forced to issue 10 tickets a day

A brave traffic warden who exposed the secret quotas enforced by parking bosses has been awarded £20,000 for unfair dismissal.

Hakim Berkani, 44, was hailed a hero after revealing that wardens are forced to issue 10 tickets a day - but he was told he will not be able to get his old job back as it would be returning him to ‘the lions’ den’.

Details of the Kensington and Chelsea quota policy emerged at a tribunal which ruled he was wrongly sacked for opposing contractor NSL, which has deals in boroughs across the capital, including Westminster.

The judgement found Mr Berkani was sacked because of his opposition to the secret quota.

It also found his managers sacked him under trumped up charges.

Mr Berkani had wanted his former job back but today the tribunal ruled 'trust and confidence' between the parties had eroded to an extent where that would be impossible.

Instead they awarded £20,000 pay out including three months wages for future losses.

Employment Tribunal judge Jeremy Burns said the managers he was in conflict with would still be his supervisors and re-hiring him would send him back to the 'lions’ den'.

He said: 'We did find the claimant opposed the quota system, the operation of which put pressure on the civil enforcement officers to issue tickets.

'We found that it was this situation which led to the deterioration between the claimant and his managers.

'His managers are still in the same position and if he were to be re-instated they would still have their daggers drawn. They do not accept the rulings of the tribunal and it would be like sending him back to the lion’s den. 

The father-of-two, from Wandsworth, 
was sacked for gross misconduct last February, following three years’ 
service, after tipping off a driver set to be given a ticket by another 
warden.

At the previous tribunal hearing in 
Holborn, judge Jeremy Burns ruled that Mr Berkani was unfairly dismissed
for his 'opposition to the respondent’s clandestine quote system' and 
his GMB trade union activities.

Mr Burns said the former warden was an intelligent man who spoke a number of languages and should find suitable employment within three months.

The contractor NSL said 'trust and confidence' between Mr Berkani and his employer had 'broken down to the core' and re-hiring him would be an 'untenable situation'.

But Mr Berkani said the company did not want to hire him because a quota system was still in place.

He said: 'I believe the practices are still in place and they believe my presence there would impact the productivity and the issuing of tickets.'

NSL head of Human Resource director Janet Daley refused to answer any questions regarding whether if the contractor still operated a secret quota system.

But the contractor has repeatedly denied the existence of a secret quota.Under questioning from Alasdair Seton-Marsden, acting for Mr Berkani, Mrs Daley refused to comment if NSL still operated quotas.

She said: 'I refuse to answer any questions on a quota system.'

She said managers at other depots in London would resign if Mr Berkani was redeployed there. 

Mr Berkani said he had been blacklisted from other parking contractors’ employers.

He said: 'I applied for many jobs with other contractors and local councils but never got a reply.

'I was blacklisted.'

He told the tribunal he had applied for more than 200 jobs since being sacked from NSL last February but had been unable to obtain suitable work.

He said: 'I will work anywhere I am just desperate for a job. But there are no jobs out there and whenever I apply there are 50 or more applicants for one job.

'I wanted to work as a public servant and do a duty for the public. That dream job was taken away when they unfairly sacked me.'

Outside court Mr Berkani said he was disappointed he would not return to work patrolling the streets of Kensington and Chelsea.

He said: 'I’m very disappointed because I believe that justice has not been done. My job was worth more to me than any amount of money.

'It was judged that I was sacked unfairly and yet NSL punished for their actions.'

The tribunal found that three NSL bosses - Andrew Davison, Stephen Rowlands and Andy Dunbar - had tried to 'frame' Mr Berkani on trumped-up charges.
