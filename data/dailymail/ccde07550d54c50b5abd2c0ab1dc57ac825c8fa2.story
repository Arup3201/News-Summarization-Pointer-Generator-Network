From today, it could cost you less to fly to Washington from London than getting a train from the UK capital to Edinburgh.

Icelandic airline WOW Air is living up to its name by launching a new budget route that costs less than £100. The introductory fare is available through the airline's website to those booking a selected number of sale-price seats from today. 

The flights to America, which will take off from Gatwick on 27 March for just £99 one-way, stop off in Iceland before heading to Boston.

Wow Air: Skuli Mogensen (above), the budget airline's chief executive, said the routes were 'just the beginning of our plans to transform low-cost transatlantic flights'

There will also be flights to Washington for the same price starting from 4 June. All will include a layover in Reykjavik, the small Icelandic capital.  

So far the website has been flooded with interest. 'The reaction has been great,' says Skúli Mogensen, CEO of WOW air. 'We have a significant amount of tickets available for this initial launch and there will be more avail throughout spring and autumn 2015.'

The only caveat? The Reykjavik stopover will make the outbound flight to Boston over three hours longer than a direct trip and five and a half hours longer on the return leg.

The flights will go via Keflavik International Airport, which is in the town (above) 30 miles west of Reykjavik

For Washington, the outbound and return journeys take around two hours and four hours longer than direct ones respectively.

You might need to spend  more on extras too as the ticket price includes  5 kg of hand luggage. Checking in a bag will cost passengers £39 and to upgrade legroom from the standard 30 inches to 35 inches is £14.

But for those who aren't in a rush, and don’t mind travelling light, this could open the door on transatlantic travel.

The flight to Boston will take off from London five days a week and the Washington flight will leave four times each week.

The flights from Reykjavik to the US will be operated using Airbus A321 Extended Range aircraft. WOW air’s existing Airbus A320 family aircraft will carry passengers from London Gatwick to Reykjavik on the first leg of the journey.

Skúli Mogensen claims this is just the beginning of the airline’s plans to transform low-cost transatlantic flights.

‘Not only are we providing flights to the USA for less than a standard London to Edinburgh train ticket, we’re opening the market to a whole new market of travellers who might previously not have been able to afford transatlantic travel,’ he says.

He added: ‘The low-cost airline market is scrambling to offer cheap flights to North America and I’m happy that we‘ll be among the first to do so and at a price point that will no doubt cause our rivals to re-evaluate their plans.’

And what of the future? 'We expect to continue to grow and passengers can expect to see more cheap flight routes to North America opening from WOW in the following two years.'

They are not the first low cost airline looking to stretch to long haul services.

Four months ago another budget Scandinavian airline, Norwegian, began offering direct flights from Gatwick to New York, Los Angeles and Fort Lauderdale for less than £150. 

But relatively few are priced at that marker and most, you’ll find when booking, cost more. 

The cheapest flight to New York in either November or December one-way with Norwegian at the moment is £209 while the cheapest flight in January 2015 is £179.

Ryanair has previously said it hopes to launch flights to America for £10 each way but the airline does not currently have the medium or long-range aircrafts to offer the routes.

Similarly Air Asia X and Jetstar have flown long haul and less successful attempts have been made by Laker Airlines and Zoom Airlines. Oasis Hong Kong went bankrupt in 2008 after launching flights from Hong Kong to Gatwick and Vancouver.
