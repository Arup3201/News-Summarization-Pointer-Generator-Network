The Governor of the Bank of England has advised a businessman who was refused a loan to try borrowing from a Swedish bank instead.

Mike Benson was so 'incensed' when the Bank of Scotland refused to lend him £10,000 for a new transit van for his successful business he wrote to Sir Mervyn King to demand an explanation.

In an apparent acknowledgement of the failure of British banks to lend to small businesses, Sir Mervyn suggested Mr Benson approach the Swedish Handelsbanken.

Mike Benson said it was a 'damning indictment' of the state of British banks in the UK

Mr Benson, who was refused a £10,000 loan, praised Sir Mervyn King for his response

Sir Mervyn, who is being replaced by Canadian Mark Carney in July, said he understood 'how maddening' such decisions are.

In the letter, he wrote: 'I was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van.

'I can fully understand how maddening that, and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to, must have been.'

Latest figures show that lending to businesses has continued to fall.

Data
 from the Bank of England shows that lending to businesses and 
individuals in the final quarter of last year dropped by £2.4billion.

Mr Benson’s firm, which supplies 
air compressors across the world, has been in profit for the last 15 
years and has customers as far afield as the US and Chile.

Bank
 of Scotland refused Mr Benson a loan arguing his business did not have 
sufficient 'fixed assets' - items that can be sold if a loan goes wrong -
 to act as security.

Mr Benson, 65, who runs air compressor export firm Airwave International in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said he was shocked that Sir Mervyn had responded to his letter personally.

The father-of-two said: 'Sir Mervyn King’s letter was absolutely delightful.

'He was obviously quite cross that the banks were not lending money to profitable businesses.

Sir Mervyn, who is leaving his role as Governor of the Bank of England, pictured, in July, said the Government could ask publically-owned banks 'to lend more' to businesses

'I
 have to say his response for me to try a Swedish bank was quite 
staggering and a damning indictment of the way British banks deal with 
businesses in this country.

'In many ways, I do think, well good on him because he was being totally honest and bully for him.'

Mr Benson was especially angry with the Bank of Scotland because instead of being granted the loan, he was offered a free 'counselling' service and the use of a free business mentor to help him grow his business.

He said: 'I thought that was sweet and patronising. To offer counselling to someone who has been in business for this long, and at my age.'

The Bank of Scotland, which is part owned by the taxpayer, said he did not have the assets to secure the loan

A bank spokesman said: 'On a case by case basis, there can be circumstances when we ask for security for a loan through a personal guarantee and we do our best to make this clear to our customers.'

The British Bankers Association reported a fall of nearly £300million in lending to four million small and medium-sized businesses at the end of last year.

Two government-backed schemes, Project Merlin and Funding for Lending (FLS) have apparently had little effect on business lending so far.

Mr Benson remarked: 'Merlin was supposed to be a magician, but there’s certainly no magic about what the banks have been doing.

'There will come a point when we don’t need the banks. And sayonara to the banks.'

Mike Benson did not take Sir Mervyn’s advice and is now looking into buying the van from his own funds.

The Bank of England has confirmed the letter Sir Mervyn King wrote to Mike Benson was genuine.

A spokeswoman said: 'We cannot comment on the contents of the letter, it was a private letter sent by Sir Mervyn to Mr Benson which has somehow found its way into the public domain.

'I would draw your attention to the fact that Sir Mervyn was suggesting other lenders to Mr Benson when he gave the name of the Swedish bank, it was not a recommendation.'

The letter, pictured,  from Sir Mervyn has been confirmed as genuine by the Bank of England

Dear Mr Benson. Thank you for your letter of 9 January.

I appreciate you taking the time to outline your recent experience.

I was sorry to read of the difficulty you have had in trying to replace your transit van.

I can fully understand how maddening that, and the behaviour you describe from the banks you have spoken to, must have been.

Your experience is common to that of many of the companies across the UK that I have visited recently.

Accessing credit appears to have 
been most testing for SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises), for which 
bank lending is a particularly important source of finance.

Unlike SMEs, large companies can 
generally resort to alternative sources of funding, for example by going
 directly to the main capital markets - which can act as a ‘safety 
valve’ when bank lending is impaired.

There are a number of policies that could help.

The Government could ask the 
publicly-owned banks to lend more to SMEs or guarantee bank lending to 
SMEs, or encourage new banks, that have more capacity to meet the 
borrowing needs of SMEs, to enter the market.

The Bank of England cannot take 
decisions such as these - which sectors should receive credit and on 
what terms, are political and rightly for elected officials.

Nevertheless, I hope that our 
Funding for Lending Scheme, which is providing funding to banks at rates
 linked to their performance in sustaining or expanding their lending to
 the UK non-financial sector, might provide some relief to all types of 
borrowers, including SMEs.

More generally, I would encourage people who have had problems with their bank to try new lenders.

One such example is 
Handelsbanken, a long-established, but relatively new to the UK, Swedish
 bank, which has grown rapidly in the past few years.”

Yours sincerely, Mervyn King.
