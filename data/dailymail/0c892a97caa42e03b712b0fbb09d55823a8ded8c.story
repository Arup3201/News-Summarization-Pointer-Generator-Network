Fears have frequently been raised that heavy use of the internet can re-wire teenage brains.

But ‘no evidence’ has been found that ‘typical’ use of the net harms young minds, according to a study review.

Yet experts claim that more work is needed before any firm conclusion can be drawn.

Keep on surfing: 'No evidence' has been found that 'typical' use of the internet harms young minds, according to a study review. Yet experts claim that more work is needed before any firm conclusion can be drawn

Neuroscientist Kathryn Mills, a PhD student at University College London looked at evidence from 135 previous studies focusing on ‘typical’ internet use that did not involve problem behaviours such as spending extreme amounts of time on-screen.

Speaking at a news briefing in London, she said: ‘Finding lack of evidence is different to finding evidence of no effect.

‘I have not found evidence that typical internet use is harming the adolescent brain.’

In a paper to be published in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, she points out that the right research to answer the question has not yet been conducted.

‘There is currently no evidence to suggest that internet use has or has not had a profound effect on brain development.’

UCL expert Kathryn Mills said: 'There is currently no evidence to suggest that internet use has or has not had a profound effect on brain development.' Previous studies have used MRI scans (stock image is pictured) to study brain activity in online 'addicts'

‘If we want to know how this highly connected world is impacting our brains, we will need to conduct studies that investigate brain measures and their relationship to behaviour, cognition, and well-being in a representative sample of the population,’ she said.

In response to claims that internet use is causing major re-wiring to the teenage brain, Ms Mills said: ‘I’m doubtful that that is the case.’

In 2011, a study by neuroscientists and radiologists at universities and hospitals in China claimed that excessive internet usage - between eight and 14hours a day - may cause parts of teenagers’ brains to waste away.

Scientists discovered signs of atrophy of grey matter in the brains of heavy internet users that grew worse over time.

They warned that this could affect their concentration and memory, their ability to make decisions and set goals and could even reduce their inhibitions and lead to ‘inappropriate’ behaviour.

In 2012, another study said that internet addiction disrupts nerve wiring in the brains of teenagers, causing a level of brain damage normally seen in heavy substance abusers.

The Chinese study used MRI scans to examine the brains of teen internet addicts and occasional users and the brain scans showed significant damage to white matter in the brains of those hooked on online games.
