Only last year Britain’s gardens, parks and woodlands were awash with a stunning riot of colour. But Mother Nature has been far less obliging this spring.

Much of the country has failed to shake off the winter blues, as a bitter March followed hard on the heels of a cold winter.

With spring delayed by over a month and no real signs of seasonal flowers such as tulips or bluebells, many will be wondering if Britain will ever burst into bloom.

A burst of colour: Visitors at Kew's Royal Botanic Gardens saw the cherry trees in full bloom

Gloomy: This year the cherry walk is bare and barren as the harsh weather has forced the trees into 'survival mode'

But garden writer Nigel Colborn, a former Royal Horticultural Society vice-chairman, says that with the arrival of warmer weather, we are likely to have a much shorter but more intense spring awakening.

Forecasters are predicting temperatures will remain higher than the seasonal average for the rest of the week – a boon for gardeners.

Mr Colburn said: ‘Plants, particularly spring varieties, have a self-survival kit.

'They won’t grow until the temperature is above 4C (39F) degrees for a period of time. Once warm weather sticks around they’ll kick into rapid growth.

‘Because of the bitterly cold March, we are running about a month late compared to a normal season.

‘Instead of it being a drawn-out 
spring, we are going to have an explosion of colour, but over a shorter 
period.We will soon be treated to a fantastically colourful bounty.’

After a pleasant, sunny weekend for much
of the country, the Met Office says temperatures will remain slightly 
warmer than the seasonal average this week – reaching 20C (68F) by 
Thursday in the south east.

But it is still too soon to pack away your winter woollens. At the weekend temperatures are due to plummet to a chilly 6C (43F).

Slowly but surely: Oshia Pota, 28, soaks up the spring sunshine as she sits among the daffodils in London's Hyde Park today

Pretty: People punting on the River Cam in Cambridge today, with clear blue skies and warmer temperatures

Blue skies: It was a chilly start to the day across much of the UK, but the bright, crisp conditions were ideal for runners taking part in the London Marathon

Unsettled: Dog walkers in Essex enjoyed the spring sunshine at the beach - but wore coats to keep off the chill

Having fun: Dogs were pictured enjoying the spring sunshine on Chalkwell seafront in Essex today

May is almost upon us, but there were
still patches of frost in parts of the UK overnight between Saturday and Sunday, with a low of 
-2.7C in Charlwood, Surrey.

While there will be some sunny spells
across the UK in the coming week, Britons are advised to keep their 
umbrellas and jackets close to hand along with their sunglasses.

Mr Lawrence described bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, bringing wind and showers to the UK.

'This week on the whole is on the unsettled side and quite changeable.

'We've got bands of rain moving in from the Atlantic, although it won't be a wash out.'

Sunny start: Runners basked in bright sunshine as the London Marathon kicked off in the capital this morning, but temperatures remained chilly early on

Bright: The sun shone brightly over London as the men's wheelchair elite approached the finish line during today's marathon

Making the most of it: Kite-flyers didn't let the moderate temperatures put them off making the most of the sunshine over Martello Bay beach in Clacton-on-Sea

Calm seas: Lifeguards took part in a practice session in a sunny Chalkwell, Essex, today

Preparing for spring: Fallow deer at Longleat Safari Park in Wiltshire were shedding their winter coats - and birds were spotted plucking the moulting fur to line their nests

Cheeky: Jackdaws were spotted plucking at fallow deer shedding their winter coats at a safari park in Wiltshire

'Mixed bag': Met Office forecasters are predicting a week of changeable weather

'A fair bit of cloud' is also 
expected throughout the week, he said, with conditions likely to change 
from sunny to grey even 'within each day'.

'Temperatures in the south might 
manage 20C in the South East later in the week, perhaps by Thursday,' 
said the forecaster, who added that current temperatures were fairly 
typical for the time of year.

'So it will be warm at times in the south. Broadly speaking we've got a north-south split, with the north wetter and windier, but still with some sunshine. In the south it will be less wet and windy.'

While temperatures dropped to 2.7C in Surrey overnight, Lossiemouth in Scotland recorded a low of 7.6C, in a 'flip' of the typical pattern of warmer conditions in the south.
