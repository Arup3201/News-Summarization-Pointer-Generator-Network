Since her marriage to Prince William in April 2011 Kate Middleton has become known around the world as the Duchess of Cambridge.

But now one historian, who has avidly studied Kate's royal's family tree, claims that the 32-year-old could well have the wrong title.

Michael Reed, an Australian historian, believes that the new mother could lay claim to the title of Duchess of Oxford thanks to her strong links to the city.   

Has she got the wrong title? A historian claims that the Duchess of Cambridge could be named the Duchess of Oxford because her ancestors all studied there

Mr Reed, a history lecturer at Hallam Senior College in Melbourne, has long had an interest in the future Queen, who recently announced she was pregnant with her second child. 

He began researching her ancestors because he wanted to prove claims that she was a 'commoner' wrong. 

During his extensive research, he discovered that the 32-year-old's grandfather, Peter Middleton, as well as other relatives, all studied at the esteemed Oxford University.

Speaking to the Oxford Mail, he said: 'We’ve done a lot of research in the past few months which suggests that when Kate does eventually get to Oxford she should be called the Duchess of Oxford because many of her family studied there.

'I would say that there is a stronger argument for Kate to have been given an Oxford title.'

Mr Reed, who is penning a book based on his research, discovered that Kate’s grandfather studied English at New College in 1939, before leaving to train as a pilot during the Second World War.

Fate? Mr Reed discovered that Kate's grandfather, Peter Middleton, left, as well as other relatives, all studied at the esteemed Oxford University - and later worked as Prince Philip’s co-pilot on their two-month South American tour

In 1962, he found himself working as Prince Philip’s co-pilot on their two-month South American tour.

And it wasn't just Kate's grandfather, who passed away in 2010, who has links to Oxford.

Mr Reed has revealed that Mr Middleton's great-great-grandfather’s brother, Dr James Martineau, was principal of Harris Manchester College in Oxford, as was Mr Middleton's great-grandfather's brother, Joseph Lupton Esq.

Mr Middleton’s great-uncle, the Rt Hon Lord Mayor Hugh Lupton, also attended University College. 

Big day: Kate Middleton left behind her commoner roots and her name became Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in 2011

Aubrey de Vere was the last Earl of Oxford back in 1703.

Mr Reed added: 'Given that she’s going to be the Queen of Australia at some point, we might as well get the background right.'

Kate Middleton left behind her commoner roots and her name became Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cambridge when she married William in 2011. 

She also became Kate the Countess of Strathearn and Baroness Carrickfergus – though the titles are used only rarely, mainly in Scotland, where they met and fell in love, and Northern Ireland respectively.

Baby on board: Earlier this month, the country rejoiced when it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again

All titles are gifts from the Queen, but Her Majesty conferred them following private discussions with her grandson and his bride. 

The Duke of Cambridge has been a royal title since the reign of Charles II.

The first Duke of Cambridge was a Stuart prince who only lived for a few months, followed by others who were styled with title but also died very young.

George, Elector of Hanover, also held the title and went on to become King George II.

He was the last English monarch to lead his troops into battle - at Dettingen in 1743.

The title - a popular name for pubs -  links William to the city  where his father, the Prince of Wales, went to university.

Earlier this month, the country rejoiced when it was announced that the Duchess of Cambridge is pregnant again.

But the spare is proving as troublesome for the Duchess as the heir - Kensington Palace officials were forced to announce the pregnancy early because Kate, right, is suffering from severe hyperemesis gravidarum.
