Marc Jacbos closed New York Fashion Week yesterday with an unprecedented move: sending his supermodels down the runway wearing no make-up whatsoever, or so it is claimed.

Heavyweights including Karlie Kloss, Joan Smalls, Gigi Hadid, Kendall Jenner, Adriana Lima, Candice Swanepoel, Jessica Stam, Jessica Hart and Hilary Rhoda   stomped down the runway indistinguishable from each other with choppy dark wigs and uncharacteristically washed out faces.

'It’s probably the only show in New York where we’re not going to apply any make-up,' backstage make-up chief Francois Nars told Fashionista. 'Absolutely no makeup whatsoever. Not one gram of makeup. Only moisturizing lotion and that’s it.'

While the normcore trend for laid back beauty has held strong with many designers this past week, it's still the sort of look that requires a lick of foundation and a sweep of mascara, at the very least.

Especially since Marc Jacobs' star models were turning up backstage with faces of inevitable exhaustion following their non-stop week of dashing from show to show, and party to party.

'We love the undereye circles!' Mr Nars exclaimed, mentioning that 'most' of his models naturally had 'very good skin.'

He did, however, confess to New York Magazine: 'If there is a little problem, we will touch it up but in a very minimal way.'

Marching orders: 'I think Marc sees these girls as an army,' Mr Nars said. 'The colors in the collection are kind of military. Pictured from left, Jessica Hart, Ms Rhoda, Jessica Stam, unidentified

And while the likes of Karlie Kloss and Jessica Hart posted #Iwokeuplikethis-style selfies to their Instagram accounts in which they do indeed appear to be bare-faced, backstage snaps show make-up stations cluttered with Nars concealers and foundations.

Still, Mr Nars insists his team's only pre-show concerns, other than covering the odd zit here or there, were with keeping the models 'moisturized.'

According to the beauty guru, it was Mr Jacobs who initially raised the idea, suggesting his models 'maybe shouldn't have much make-up,' but it was Mr Nars who proposed they strip them of all of it.

Go big or go home: The catwalk was built around a large, doorless and windowless construction in lurid pink 

'I think Marc sees these girls as an army. The colors in the collection are kind of military, with beige, khaki, caramel, and chocolate,' Mr Nars said.

'But we're not locked into having to apply make-up or blush or lip gloss. Sometimes I see women journalists... wearing nothing, and I love that, it's just a part of life.'

Speaking to ELLE, he concluded: 'In 2014, it’s great that we are doing this.

'In the '60s, '50s, and '40s, women had to wear make-up. It was a rule. Today there are no rules: You can do anything you want.'
