Tragic: Shaun Van Straaten lost his fight for life today, police confirmed, while his relatives remain in a critical condition in hospital.

A schoolboy has died after a fire at his family home, which is believed to have been started by his mother's ex-boyfriend, David Potts.

Shaun Van Straaten, 15, was critically injured in the blaze and was taken to hospital for treatment to burns and smoke inhalation, along with other family members, named locally as his mother, Tracy Jones, 40, sister, Cailin, 18, and four-year-old brother, Zach.

Shaun lost his fight for life today, police confirmed, while his relatives remain in a critical condition in hospital.

Potts, 39, was taken to hospital suffering from severe burns but died a short time after the blaze started, at around 4.50am on Monday.

Potts had reportedly gone to the house in Barlow Road in Broadheath, Altrincham, Greater Manchester, and set himself alight.

Police have said this is a ‘line of inquiry’ but confirmed the fire is being treated as suspicious and they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the incident.

Local reports suggested that Potts had split up with Ms Jones and had attempted to get back with her but was rebuffed.

The 39-year-old apparently left a Facebook message for Miss Jones at 1am on Monday, saying: ‘I used to be happy but now I am sad. I used to laugh, now I cry.

‘I used to be someone, now I am no one’, he added just four hours before going to her home, where they allegedly had an argument, the Daily Mirror reported.

After the row, he is said to have poured petrol over his body and screamed: ‘If I can’t have you, no one will’, and lit a match.

The former couple are said to have had a one-year on-off relationship, which began when his teenage son Nathan started dating Cailin.

Potts and Jones’s relationship was apparently ‘stormy’ and police had reportedly been called to the house on several occasions.

Potts is also said to have fallen out with Shaun last October and wrote him a message saying: 'Please read this before telling me to f*** off… I am sorry for what happened.’

He then wrote on Facebook afterwards: ‘Why is life so hard – you can’t live with them but you can’t live without them.’

After getting back together briefly, Potts and Jones split again in August and he posted on Facebook one month ago: ‘My life is s***. Lost my girlfriend and her kids.’

He added the following day: ‘Anyone with me to get my life back. Had it taken away, going to fight for it.’

Police have confirmed there had been 
contact with Ms Jones, believed to be over unwanted attention from 
Potts, within the last month.

The matter has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.

Neighbours said they heard shouting and a disturbance at the address before it went up in flames.

Tracy and Cailin tried to put out the
fire but the blaze ripped through the ground floor of the family’s 
£120,000 semi-detached house.

Firefighters stormed inside the property and carried out Shaun and Zach, who had been asleep in bed.

Neighbours managed to pull Tracy, a typist, from the house after college student Cailin staggered outside and cried for help.

Neighbour Kevin Pearce, 41, a supermarket worker said: 'I woke up from hearing screaming and smashing glass.

'I looked out my bedroom window, saw 
smoke and I told my partner to call the fire brigade. I dashed out of 
the house as fast as I could and I could see the daughter was already on
the grass outside.

'The front door was locked but the 
downstairs window was open and I managed to pull the window off the 
hinges. I could see Tracy and I managed to tug her through the window 
frame.

'She was conscious but in obvious 
shock and was screaming and hysterical. I wasn’t thinking anything about
my own safety - it was pure adrenaline was driving me to get her out.

'I got the mum out and ran around the
back and that’s where the older son was, but that was locked, so I 
pulled the back window off but the smoke was too much.

'Then the emergency services came and
I told them that someone was in the kitchen and the little lad was 
upstairs in his bedroom.

'It’s such a tragedy. This is a quiet neighbourhood and they were a lovely family who always said hello.'

Fire, police and forensic officers search for clues following the blaze in the early hours of Monday

Chief Superintendent Mark Roberts, 
from Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘This is an absolutely tragic 
case, which has now taken the life of a 15-year-old boy.

‘Our thoughts are with Shaun's family at this very sad time and with the families of all of those involved.

‘The police and fire service are 
continuing to thoroughly investigate the fire and the circumstances 
leading up to the fire, so we can find out exactly what happened inside 
the house on Monday morning.

‘It would be inappropriate for us to 
speculate further on the cause of the fire at this stage of the 
investigation, but we are not currently looking for anyone else in 
relation to this incident.

‘If anyone in the local community has
any information they believe may help us with our investigation, I 
would urge you to please come forward and speak to the police.’
