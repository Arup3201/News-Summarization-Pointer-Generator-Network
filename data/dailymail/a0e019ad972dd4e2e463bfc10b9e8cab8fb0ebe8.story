Sheila Hibbert went three days without insulin injections after doctors at Bradford Royal Infirmary failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged

A diabetic grandmother who went up to three days without receiving insulin injections died as the result of multiple failings by hospital staff, a coroner has ruled.

Sheila Hibbert, 77, was admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary where staff failed to check her blood sugar levels or give her prescribed treatments for up to nine hours.

The grandmother went an additional 24 hours without receiving any medication as the hospital failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged, an inquest heard.

By the time Mrs Hibbert's nurse, who had administered her insulin on a daily basis since 1991, arrived at her home, the 77-year-old's blood sugar levels were considerably high.

She was taken to hospital for a second time, where she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis, a dangerous complication caused by lack of insulin.

The pensioner, who was also undergoing chemotherapy for endometrial cancer, died from multiple organ failure on February 6, just a week after being admitted to Bradford Royal Infirmary. 

Bradford Assistant Coroner Dominic Bell said a 'series of assumptions' from nurses and doctors contributed to Mrs Hibbert not receiving her medication.

Dr Bell ruled there was a failure to identify the origins of her admission symptoms, a failure to identify her deteriorating renal function, a failure to act on her high blood sugar levels, a failure to prescribe and administer the appropriate insulin and a failure to notify the district nursing team when she was discharged.

During the inquest, the court heard that Mrs Hibbert was with her son and daughter-in-law on January 30 last year when she began feeling unwell. 

Mrs Hibbert was kept in hospital overnight where she was already due to undergo chemotherapy the following day.

She was discharged from hospital on January 31 after her scheduled chemotherapy, but the district nurse said she was not aware her patient was back home until February 2, when she received a call from staff at Ward 15.

Care workers had found Mrs Hibbert was ill at home and called the hospital.

District nurse Laila Bretts told the inquest: 'We kind of got a bit worried thinking that as far as we knew she wasn’t at home. 

'Then they told us she had actually been discharged on the Tuesday, at which point I picked up my coat and bag and set off.

A coroner ruled staff at the hospital failed to ensure the 77-year-old received appropriate medication and failed to notify her district nurse when she was discharged

'I realised then she hadn’t been seen on Wednesday to have her insulin.'

Despite care workers' best efforts, Mrs Hibbert's condition did not improve. She was taken back to the hospital where she died days later.

Mrs Hibbert’s 50-year-old son Julian is now pursuing legal action against Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

Speaking after the hearing, he said: 'It seems there was a complete breakdown - nobody seemed to be doing what was expected, and nobody seemed to be taking responsibility.

'It seems there have been a lot more mistakes made than we initially thought - mistakes all the way through.'

The inquest heard that since Mrs Hibbert’s death changes had been made at the hospital ward following an investigation.

Mr Hibbert, of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, added: 'The new measures seem to be very good, but they’re too late for us.

A spokesman for Bradford Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust expressed their 'sincere and heartfelt' condolences to the Hibbert family

'My mum was a very quiet person, but one of the main reasons we got so involved was that she would have been appalled if she’d read about it happening to someone else.

'She would have thought it important and she would have wanted to do something about it.'

A spokesman at the Trust said after the hearing: 'We would like to pass on our sincere and heartfelt condolences to Mrs Hibbert’s family.

'The Foundation Trust has taken Mrs Hibbert’s death extremely seriously and we acknowledge that the care provided to Mrs Hibbert fell below acceptable standards.

'The Foundation Trust took immediate action to investigate the circumstances surrounding this sad loss of life and took swift action to ensure that lessons were learned by all staff and that lasting improvements to clinical care were made.

'The Foundation Trust accepts fully the findings of the inquest and recognises that there are additional lessons to be learned for all medical and nursing staff. The Foundation Trust will act upon the findings as a matter of urgency'.
