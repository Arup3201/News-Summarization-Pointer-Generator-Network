Suing: Michael Brodkorb is filing a wrongful termination suit because he argues that women who have had affairs in the Minnesota state senate have not been fired but he was

A man who was fired after having an affair with his married Republican superior is now threatening to expose other affairs within the Minnesota State Senate.

Michael Brodkorb, the former communications director of the State Senate's Republican leader Amy Koch, was fired the day after Mrs Koch resigned amid allegations that the two had an affair.

Though he was fired back in December, he is now suing for wrongful dismissal because he feels that he was only fired because he is a man who had an interoffice affair.

He has threatened to depose a number of his female colleagues who have had similar affairs but were able to keep their jobs.

'Mr. Brodkorb has evidence that similarly situated female legislative employees, from both political parties, were not terminated from their employment positions despite intimate relationships with male legislators,' the legal document asserts.

'It is clear that Mr. Brodkorb was terminated based on his gender.

'He intends to depose all of the female legislative staff employees who participated in intimate relationships, as well as the legislators who were party to those intimate relationships, in support of his claims of gender discrimination.'

When Mrs Koch resigned over the holidays, she did not reveal the name of her lover.

But given that she and Mr Brodkorb were 
extremely close- and that he was fired by Republican higher-ups the next
day, the local press was quick to make the connection.

'I made errors in judgement, for which I am deeply sorry, by engaging in a relationship with a Senate staffer,' she said at the time.

She was certain to point out that the affair was not against the law nor did she abuse her power and had not 'misused any state funds or property'.

Though Mr Brodkorb's lawyer insists that his client is not simply threatening to air his colleague's dirty laundry for fun, but out of necessity.

Lawyer Phil Vallaume told The Minnesota Star Tribune that the depositions with the alleged infidels would take place in private to protect their identities.

Mrs Koch has remained tight-lipped about the issue, and has yet to publicly confirmed whether or not Mr Brodkorb was the man in question, though his actions seem to have done the work for her.
