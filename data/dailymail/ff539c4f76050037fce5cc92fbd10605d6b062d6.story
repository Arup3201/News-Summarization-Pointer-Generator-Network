A 26-year-old man was killed and a 29-year-old man injured in Philadelphia last night in a drive by shooting outside the tour bus of rapper French Montana.

The Moroccan-born artist whose debut album, due to launch in May, features a track with Nicki Minaj, had just played a headline show at the city's Theater of Living Arts when gunfire erupted outside the Holiday Inn Express on Christopher Columbus Boulevard, where he and his entourage had rooms booked.

A group of fans followed French Montana's tour bus to the hotel and was gathered around the vehicle when a car pulled up and opened fire around midnight, police said.

The victim, who was shot in the stomach, was taken to Hahnemann Univserity Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 1:30 a.m. He was later identified as Jowann King of New York. The injured man was shot in the shoulder and is now in stable condition at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital.

The 28-year-old rapper, who was among a group of around 25 people who were questioned by police, was clearly unfazed by the death of one of his fans, tweeting 'nobody got time for this s**t' with a photo of him and an investigator.

Chief Inspector Scott Small said they don't think the rapper or his entourage were targeted in the shooting. Neither victim appeared to be with the rapper's group. Instead they believe it may have been an altercation between groups of fans.

Police gathered everyone on the tour bus into the lobby of the Holiday Inn immediately after the incident and then transported them to the Homicide Unit to be interviewed.

Small said one man may have returned fire, and three men, who were found with loaded handguns, were taken into custody and remained there overnight.

According to Philly.com, police found at least seven shell casings near the tour bus but the vehicle itself appeared to escape gunfire.

Police are investigating a parked car found riddled with bullet holes near Jefferson Hospital's emergency room, though it is believed to be the vehicle that took the injured victim to hospital.

The Philadelphia gig was part of the 28-year-old rapper's 'Excuse my French' tour to promote his upcoming album.

He is the CEO of Cocaine City Records in New York and tweeted a picture of himself with some pals on the tour bus presumably moments before the shooting, with the caption 'tour bus life' clearly enjoying his new found fame.
