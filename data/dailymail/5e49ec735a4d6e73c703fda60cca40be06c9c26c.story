Britain's biggest rail project since the Victorian age could be partly funded by China.

After talks in Beijing yesterday with David Cameron, Premier Li Keqiang said he wanted a slice of the £50billion High Speed 2 scheme.

He added that his country also wanted to step up ‘co-operation’ over nuclear power and invest in UK energy projects.

China boasts world's largest and quickest-growing high-speed rail network but there has been evidence of corruption after a crash that killed 40 people

Mr Cameron responded with comments made in the city’s political hub, the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square.

He said it was right to explore ‘all the opportunities of economic openness – openness of Britain to Chinese investment’.

He added that there had been ‘huge amounts in recent months and years’.

The Prime Minister declared there were also ‘opportunities for further opening our trade relations and building on our trade and business relations’.

However, there is controversy over allowing China, a former Cold War enemy, to take a critical stake in key infrastructure projects.

Already ministers have allowed the Chinese to take a 30 per cent stake in a new nuclear plant at  Hinkley Point, Somerset.

But yesterday it became clear China has far greater ambitions.

These include investing in new nuclear projects and the proposed HS2 line from London to the Midlands and North. Downing Street sources said Chinese investment could cut the cost of the rail scheme to British taxpayers.

China boasts the world’s largest and quickest-growing high-speed rail network. But there has been evidence of corruption and public alarm after a crash near Wenzhou, eastern China, killed 40 in 2011.

After meeting Mr Cameron and senior ministers, Mr Li said they ‘agreed to push for breakthroughs and progress’ in co-operation on nuclear power and high-speed rail.

‘The Chinese side is willing to not only participate in but also purchase equities and stocks in UK power projects,’ he added.

Mr Li welcomed Mr Cameron’s recognition of the ‘territorial  integrity’ of China, diplomatic  code for accepting Beijing’s rule over Tibet.

David Cameron protested to President Xi Jinping at the ‘completely inappropriate’ banning of a British journalist from a press conference.

Robert Hutton had to wait outside as other reporters heard Mr Cameron and Premier Li Keqiang speak.

Mr Hutton is based in London for US news agency Bloomberg, which has apparently caused anger with stories on the wealth of relatives of President Xi.

The Prime Minister said: ‘China’s transformation is one of the defining facts of our lifetime. I see  China’s rise as an opportunity for Britain and for the world.

‘Some want to shut China off behind a bamboo curtain of trade barriers. Britain wants to tear those trade barriers down.’

Former Tory deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft, in an apparent reference to human rights and Tibet, said: ‘It seems that Cameron is putting interests before principles. Some will like that, others not.’

Joe Rukin, of Stop HS2, said any Chinese involvement ‘blows apart any idea it is about creating British jobs and underlines that HS2 is all about the vanity of politicians’.

A poll for BBC Radio 5 Live yesterday revealed 52 per cent of Britons oppose the project. Only 38 per cent back HS2 in the survey of 1,000-plus people by ComRes.
