This dilapidated mansion is the last symbol of Prince Andrew’s failed marriage to Sarah Ferguson and has been left to decay seven years after the prince sold it for £15million.

To make matters worse the grand country house gifted by the Queen to her second son as a wedding gift is now under the Heathrow flight path where planes pass over it every few minutes.

12-bedroom Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, which is only around 30 years oFld, is a shadow of its former splendour and now has broken windows and boarded-up entrances.

Dubbed SouthYork because it resembles Southfork, the ranch-house in TV’s Dallas, the Duke of York sold it to Kazakh businessman Timur Kulibayev in 2007.

Royal ruin: 12-bedroom Sunninghill Park in Berkshire, which is only around 30 years old, is a shadow of its former self and is now under the Heathrow flight path

Grand:  The house was designed by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, who also created a development on the Queen's Balmoral estate

All change: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson at the Berkshire site as it was built after their marriage. 30 years on they have split up and the once grand house sold off

He paid more than £3million above the £12million asking price but since then it has become close to derelict and could be demolished after the local council gave permission nine months ago. 

Designed by Sir James Dunbar-Nasmith, who also created a development on the Balmoral estate, ‘SouthYork’ was given to Andrew after his marriage in 1986.

The Duchess of York lived on there with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie following the divorce in 1996, but moved out in 2006 and joined Andrew at his home Royal Lodge in Windsor Great Park.

It was sold a year later but has become an expensive ruin and worse it is now being bombarded by noisy Jumbo jets coming in to land at Heathrow.  

Bosses at the airport recently switched the flight-path for incoming aircraft

Former glory: Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson's crumbling marital home was not always a blot on the landscape

Gift: 'SouthYork’ was given to Andrew by the Queen after his marriage to Sarah Ferguson in 1986 but less than 30 years on it has fallen into disrepair and due for demolition

Compounded: Not only has the house become decrepit and unloved it is now under the Heathrow flight path, which has sparked fury among locals

Mossed over: The mansion's tennis court is in a very poor state seven years after it was sold to a Kazakh businessman for £3million above asking price

Past life: Ms Ferguson lived on there with daughters Beatrice and Eugenie following the divorce in 1996, but moved out in 2006

The new flight-path is part of a trial started by the National Air Traffic Services in August which will last five months. The experiment is also to be repeated next year.

An online petition set up by villagers in Ascot to stop the trial had today reached 5,500 signatures.

Neighbours told how the latest blight on the once grand mansion saw planes cruising over every two minutes, as low as 5,000 feet, with noise levels of 78 decibels being recorded.

'It's terrible - huge jumbo jets fly right over our rooftops and it's so, so noisy,' said one neighbour, who declined to be named.   

In December last near the current owner was granted planning permission tor replace the former royal home with a larger six bedroom house, with a further eight bedrooms for staff.

The new design, that was created by architects Hok, will include a family living room, drawing room, formal dining room, study and sitting rooms for children and the master suite.

A 25 metre indoor swimming pool to the south of the house to replace the current outdoor pool.

The planning permission granted by Bracknell Forest Borough Council expires in December 2016 if work has not begun on the new property.

Another resident, who described the noise from the planes as 'hellish' said of the plans for the Duke and Duchess's former home: 'We thought it might be happening this summer but obviously not. We've heard nothing since the planning application was submitted.

'It's going to be good if it goes because the history goes with it. It had lovely grounds and staff but it was never a place of great beauty.'
