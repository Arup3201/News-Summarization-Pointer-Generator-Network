Nostalgic fans of the 1970s video game Pong will recall playing it in a video arcade or perhaps on a Sega Mega Drive.

Now the classic Atari game has been beamed into the 21st century - and straight onto the walls of a 29-storey skyscraper.

A group of computer scientists commandeered programmable LED lights lining the side of a 437ft office building to stage the world's biggest video game in Philadelphia.

World's largest video game: Scientists commandeered LED lights on this Philadelphia building to play a giant version of Pong

'Cultural milestone': The version of the classic 1970s Atari game that fans will be most familiar with

More than 100 people gathered close 
to the Philadelphia Museum of Art to watch the fully interactive game of
 Pong - with 'bats' spanning nine storeys and a 20ft 'ball' - unfold on the side of the Circa Centre on the other side of the 
Schuylkill River on Friday.

Drexel
 University professor Frank Lee and his team transformed the lights - 
which typically display static images or looping patterns - into a game 
of Pong in the space of a few months, according to a report on arstechnica.com.

Mr
 Lee and his team devised a way of hack the system controlling the LED 
lights - each of which can be lit or unlit in a variety of colours - 
turning it from something designed to display static images to something
 interactive.

The Circa Centre lights, each of which has its own internet Protocol (IP) address, are controlled by a system from Philips.

The
 computer scientist explained how he and his team managed to determine 
the commands being fed to the lights, in order to interactively turn 
them on and off. One of the scientists created a script capable of 
analysing a file containing the IP addresses of all of the lights, and 
mapping out a virtual image of what the lights on the building were 
displaying at that time.

Mr
 Lee and the rest of the team used this structure to write software that
 interfaces with the programme controlling the Circa Centre lights.

The scientist and gaming buff first came up with the idea in 2008, when the patterns of light on the Circa Centre one night reminded him of another classic video game; Tetris.

'Every other night I would just pass by... but this night I saw Tetris shapes forming in my mind's eye, falling down, and that began this long journey to try to make this game possible,' Mr Lee said.

The professor told his idea was initially 'shot down' by the owners of the building, the Brandywine Realty Trust, who questioned whether anyone would be interested in a giant version of an outdated video game.

But after enlisting the support of Philly Tech Week - an event showcasing the city's technology scene - Mr Lee managed to secure a meeting with trust CEO Gerard Sweeney, who was immediately on board.

'Little kids know Pong, grandmothers and grandfathers know Pong, and so on,' said Mr Lee.

'It is part of our cultural fabric, because it was the first successful commercial video game that launched the multi-billion dollar industry that we have now.'
