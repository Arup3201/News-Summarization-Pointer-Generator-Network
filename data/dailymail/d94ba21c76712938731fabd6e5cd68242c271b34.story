Tillakaratne Dilshan will spend two spells with Derbyshire over the coming season after the Division Two county announced the signing of the experienced Sri Lanka batsman.

The 38-year-old will be available for up to four NatWest Twenty20 Blast fixtures and two LV= County Championship matches when he takes the overseas berth from New Zealand international Martin Guptill in June.

Dilshan will return to the County Ground from the Caribbean Premier League at the beginning of August and will be available for every remaining Falcons match until the end of September.
