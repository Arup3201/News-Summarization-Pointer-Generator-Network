Nintendo has admitted that it's latest console, the Wii U, has flopped, causing serious problems for the company behind such iconic games franchises as Mario Brothers and the Legend of Zelda.

The Japanese video games maker had been counting on the new console to revive its fortunes amid cut-throat competition from Microsoft's new XBox One and Sony's recently released PlayStation 4.

But despite the highest U.S. spending on consoles for three years in the run up to Christmas, the company has been forced to slash its sales forecast for its flagship device by 70 per cent.

Flop: Nintendo has announced that sales of its Wii U tablet have been abysmal, forcing it to slash its sales forecast by 70 per cent and issue a warning of a ¥35billion ($336 million) operating loss in the year to March

'We failed to reach our target for hardware sales during the year-end, when revenues are the highest,' the Osaka-based company said in a statement.

'As a result, the sale of high-margin software fell far short of our projections.'

Nintendo now says it expects an operating loss of ¥35billion ($336 million) for the year to end-March, after poor sales of its Wii U and 3DS game machines during the crucial holiday season.

The move reverses its previous forecast of a ¥100billion profit and would mark the third consecutive year of operating losses for the embattled company.

The warning comes just three months 
after Nintendo stood by its sales projections for the Wii U, and amid a 
general spring back in consumers' demand for new video games consoles.

Sales
 of video games hardware in the U.S. last December were up 28 per cent 
compared to the previous year, with shoppers taking him $1.37billion 
worth of the technology in the run up to Christmas, Bloomberg reports.

'Far short of our projections': Nintendo's president Satoru Iwata holds up one of his company's tablet-style Wii U consoles

'The newest consoles from Microsoft and Sony are off to a tremendous start,' said NPD Group analyst Liam Callaghan. 'Xbox One led consoles sales in December, while PS4's two-month total makes it the best selling console during the two-month launch window.'

The Wii U's dismal sales are a major blow to Nintendo president Satoshi Iwata, who has repeatedly had to scale back sales projections for the console as it failed to emulate the success of its hugely popular predecessor, the Wii.

Mr Iwata told a briefing a year ago, when the company warned of its second consecutive year of operating losses, that he had 'made a commitment' to achieve an operating profit of ¥100billion or more in the year to March 2014.

'The fact that the 'Wii U strategy' has failed is disappointing and will likely trigger a sell-off as soon as the market opens,' said Makoto Kikuchi, chief executive of Myojo Asset Management.

'The company appears to have failed to differentiate the Wii U from the Wii,' he said, adding that his own 10-year-old son, who owns a Wii and DS, had shown no interest in the Wii U.

Despite the surge in U.S. sales of rivals' machines, commentators are warning that the whole industry faces fierce competition from non-specialist hardware like smartphones and tablets boasting thousands of inexpensive games apps.

Ownership of such devices, dominated by Google's Android OS and Apple's iOS, has mushroomed in the past five years and shifted the gaming goalposts into consumers' pockets.

Nintendo on Friday also warned of a net loss of ¥25billion for the year ending on March 31, a substantial reversal from its prior projection of a ¥55billion profit.

It now expects revenues of ¥590billion, down 36 per cent from its prior forecast. It cut its full-year dividend to ¥100 from ¥260.

The company slashed its global Wii U sales forecast for the business year by almost 70 per cent, to 2.8 million units from 9million, and its 3DS sales forecast to 13.5million units from 18million units.

Nintendo shares have fallen almost 10 per cent since hitting a two-and-a-half year high of 15,880 yen on January 10.

The stock climbed 55 per cent in 2013, in line with a 57 per cent rally by the benchmark Nikkei average but underperforming a 91 per cent surge by rival Sony.
