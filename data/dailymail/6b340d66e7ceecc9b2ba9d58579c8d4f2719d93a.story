Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has confirmed the club are looking to sell record signing Dani Osvaldo after he failed to arrive back for pre-season.

The 28-year-old cost the Saints £15million in August 2013 but spent the second half of last season on loan at Juventus after being involved in a training-ground fight with Jose Fonte.

'It was a difficult situation for him to come back to,' Koeman told BBC Radio Solent on Tuesday.

'He was too late [coming back for pre-season],' added Koeman. 'The decision of the board was to allow him not to come back. We have to look for opportunities for him to play in a different team.'

The Italian scored three times in 13 Premier League appearances, including a fine curling strike against Manchester City at the Etihad in December.

But he was shipped out on loan to Juventus in January after being suspended for three matches and fined £40,000 for violent conduct during an incident at Newcastle, and then being involved in an altercation with team-mate Fonte on the training ground.

Meanwhile, Koeman insists no bids have been accepted for defender Dejan Lovren, who is a summer target of Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool.

Despite this the ex-Feyenoord boss confirmed the Croatian has expressed a desire to leave St Mary's.

'There are a lot of rumours,' explained Koeman. 'He said he would like to go, we will wait for the bid, but if there is no bid we will continue. I know the situation.'

Gone: The Dutchman said the club will replace the likes of Rickie Lambert and Luke Shaw

Koeman has asked the club's supporters to be patient as they look to replace defender Luke Shaw, midfielder Adam Lallana and striker Rickie Lambert, all of whom have left this summer.

'We are working on it,' he said. 'Our job is to be prepared if someone leaves the club.

'The board knows we need new players. There is no need to hurry. We have a good squad but we would like better players to be competitive.'
