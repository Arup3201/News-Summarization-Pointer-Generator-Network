Is it goodnight from him? Thankfully for Ronnie Corbett’s army of fans, the answer is most definitely not.

While the 83-year-old entertainer was treated for an inflamed gall bladder last week, he is still busy with a series of projects.

And last night his wife Anne said she was furious with what she described as an incorrect report in a red-top Sunday paper which stated he had ‘called time on his TV career’ as he ‘battles a mystery illness’.

Calling time: Ronnie Corbett, pictured here on his BBC show Ronnie's Animal Crackers with Ronnie Corbett, has had a career spanning six decades

The Two Ronnies were reunited for one night only in 1999, when they performed the famous newsreader sketch at the end of an evening dedicated to the funniest moments of their glittering career

Speaking from their home in Croydon, 
South London, she said her husband was in good health and preparing to 
film a TV pilot with the comedian Rob Brydon as well as fulfil other 
commitments he has in the pipeline.

Mrs
 Corbett, 80, added: ‘He’s got contracts and commercials that he is 
working on.

'This report [in the Sunday paper] makes him sound like he 
has died, that his career is over, which is absolutely not the case. I 
am ****ing furious.

‘He was 
taken to hospital last Thursday and doctors discovered he had an 
inflamed gall bladder. They put him on high antibiotics and he is now 
perfectly fine.’

Indeed, 
Corbett was well enough on Friday to lead prayers at the Westminster 
Abbey memorial service for his friend Sir David Frost, who died last 
year aged 74.

Corbett was on
 TV last year when he presented Ronnie’s Animal Crackers, a series about
 the British love of animals and the weird and extravagant ways we 
indulge them.

It was a 
welcome return to the small screen for the diminutive Scot, enduringly 
popular for The Two Ronnies series with Ronnie Barker in the 1970s and 
1980s.

Alongside Morecambe 
and Wise, Corbett and Barker led a golden age of comedy, with classic 
routines such as the ‘four candles’ sketch and the Mastermind skit, in 
which Corbett’s specialist subject was answering the question before 
last.

Famously, the pair 
would close each show with Corbett saying: ‘It’s goodnight from me’ and 
Barker adding: ‘And it’s goodnight from him.’

Barker died in 2005, shortly after the pair reunited for The Two Ronnies Sketchbook.

Corbett married Anne in 1965 and the couple have two daughters, Emma, 46, and Sophie, 45.

Mrs Corbett said that like 86-year-old Sir Bruce Forsyth, her husband would carry on for the foreseeable future.

‘There
 will naturally come a time when he will decide it is time to call it a 
day, but that moment has not arrived,’ she said. ‘Life goes on for 
Ronnie, as it always has done.’

The keen golfer has been on our TV screens since the 1950s and despite his years still makes regular appearances.

In
 recent years this has included memorable cameos on Ricky Gervais series
 Extras and Matt Lucas and David Walliams’ Little Britain, as well as 
presenting Strictly Come Dancing in  2009 when Sir Bruce Forsyth  was 
forced to miss a show through illness.

The diminutive Corbett 
first worked with Barker on The Frost Report and they appeared alongside
 John Cleese in the famous ‘class sketch’ in 1966.

Corbett and Barker went on to be given 
their own show, The Two Ronnies, which ran from 1971 to 1987 and 
included many memorable moments.

These included the ‘four candles/fork
 handles’ sketch, the pair’s misadventures as bungling private eyes 
Charley Farley and Piggy Malone, and the spoof news items which closed 
every show.

Corbett will 
always be associated with his monologues on the show, which were 
delivered from a comfortable easy chair, often wearing one of his 
trademark V-neck golfing jumpers.

As well as The Two Ronnies, Corbett 
appeared as Timothy Lumsden in sitcom Sorry! from 1981 to 1988.

In
 2005 he was reunited with Barker for the BBC’s The Two Ronnies 
Sketchbook, which interspersed classic moments from their show with new 
links recorded for the series. Barker died later that year.

In 2009 Corbett appeared on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories and he recently starred in Radio 4 sitcom When The Dog Dies.

The
 Edinburgh-born comedian has been married to his wife, the actress and 
dancer Anne Hart, since 1965. The couple have two daughters, Emma and 
Sophie.

His first job was at the Ministry of Agriculture and also did his National Service with the RAF.

In 2011 he was awarded the
 CBE – Commander of the Order of the British Empire – which typically goes to 
those who have made a distinguished contribution in their area of 
activity.
