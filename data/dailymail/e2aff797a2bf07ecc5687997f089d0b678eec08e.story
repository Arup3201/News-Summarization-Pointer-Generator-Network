Stand-in captain George Bailey has no concerns about his unusual status within the Australia squad.

Bailey will lead his country in the Carlton Mid Tri-Series, starting against England at the SCG on Friday, and will continue throughout the World Cup if regular skipper Michael Clarke cannot prove his fitness by February 21.

But should Clarke be ready to return by that deadline, Bailey faces the probability of dropping out of the side to make way.

Unless form or other fitness issues intervene, Bailey is expected to be behind Clarke's Test deputy Steve Smith and former vice-captain Shane Watson in the pecking order, making him vulnerable to Clarke's return.

'Does it bother me? Not at all,' said Bailey.

'We have probably more captains in the side at the moment than you can poke a stick at, which is a wonderful position to be in. I think every person who is playing, regardless of any other positions, will just be looking to perform to make the case for retaining them within the XI pretty compelling.'

Bailey is hardly an untested leader, having captained 24 of his 52 ODI matches due to Clarke's fragile body.

'I think the regularity of it has probably made it easier for me than what it would be otherwise,' he said.

'Unfortunately it has happened quite a bit over the last 12 months. 'It is something that we have been used to as a team, having to deal with not having a player like Michael in the side.

'I think we have responded pretty well when that has been the case.'

As World Cup co-hosts, Australia are desperate for Clarke to play his part in the tournament.

Bailey believes that Clarke is heading in the right direction with regard to recovering from injury in time 

He netted in Sydney with the team on Thursday and all signs are positive that the 33-year-old is heading in the right direction.

'Michael has been with us doing his training stuff and his rehab stuff around us for the last couple of days,' confirmed Bailey.

'I think he is really happy with how he is progressing, so that is all positive.

'(He is) very confident as you can imagine.'
