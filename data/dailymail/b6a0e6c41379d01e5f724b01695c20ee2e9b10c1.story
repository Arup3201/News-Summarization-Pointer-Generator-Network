A former Miss Chile has accused Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez of texting her behind his doting girlfriend's back.

Camila Andrade claimed the striker sent her holiday snaps during a winter break in Disneyland Paris with partner Laia Grassi claiming he was with a younger relative and not his other half.

And she explained how she turned down the £33million signing when he invited her out to dinner during his World Cup preparation weeks before he was pictured on a romantic beach holiday in Mexico with his current girlfriend.

MailOnline has been unable to verify whether Miss Andrade can support her claims and attempts to contact Sanchez for comment have failed to elicit a response.

In reports which have made headlines across the  media in Chile, Miss Andrade, 23, told an interviewer in her home country how he asked her out earlier this year. 

She said: 'Alexis invited me out for a meal while he was back in Chile preparing for the World Cup.

'I was between boyfriends at the time and it was the first time that he'd asked if we could meet up.

'I turned him down because he wasn't my type and I knew that many of the times he'd messaged me he was with his girlfriend and I liked that even less.

'When he was in Disneyland Paris with Laia in February he sent me a picture of himself on his own.

'I knew he was with her because I'd seen pictures in the paper and I really couldn't stop laughing.

'I messaged him to say: "How nice, you're with your girlfriend, I've love to be where you are with my boyfriend" and he replied: "No I'm with my little nephew or young cousin or some young relative", I can't remember exactly.

'He never said he was with his girlfriend and the following day there was a big picture in the paper of the two of them. It was very strange.

'All these starstruck young girls need to see all these footballers are the same and are not to be believed.'

'I've no idea how he got my number': Miss Andrade, who narrowly missed out on the Miss World finals in July last year, claims the footballer sent her a Whatsapp message out of the blue just after she won Miss Chile

It's not the first time Sanchez, 25, has made headlines off the pitch.

Spanish art director and designer Laia stuck by the Premiership marksman, who has scored six goals in his last four games, when an old squeeze claimed she was pregnant with the football star’s child. 

The day after Barcelona-based Mary Plaza, 28, made her pregnancy claim in April Laia posted a picture of her and Alexis on her Instagram page with the message: 'Amor Verdadero' - Spanish for 'True Love.'

Another ex, Brazilian model Michelle Carvalho, claimed last year the blue-eyed Spanish blonde, who posed in an Arsenal shirt on her Instagram page after Alexis joined the Gunners in July, was fooling herself if she thought she was the love of his life.

She said: 'I don't think it's anything stable, I think it's a passing thing. He only wants a good time.'

Miss Andrade, who narrowly missed out on the Miss World finals after being chosen as her nation's most beautiful woman in July last year, said the footballer sent her a Whatsapp message out of the blue just after she won Miss Chile.

She revealed: 'I was with an ex-boyfriend when he sent his first message. 

'I'd never met him in my life so when he said he was Alexis Sanchez, I replied saying: "No, you're lying, you know what, Ciao."

'He responded by phoning me straight away. I didn't answer him. I rejected the call. 

'Why am I going to answer him if I don't know him? And then he sent me a message saying I phoned you so you'd know it was me.'

She added: 'I've no idea how he got my number but he did what a lot of footballers like him do which is to speak to girls via Whatsapp.

'I don't want to go into so much detail, but I have to say he seemed very kind and very funny. 

'It makes me laugh how all the young girls speak to him. I could never ever have taken seriously some of the things he said to me.

'We never had regular conversations but I stopped answering him about two months ago after I turned down his meal invite. 

'I found it tasteless he'd ask me out while he was with someone else so I gave him the red card.

'When someone doesn't answer you, I think the other person normally gets it and understands that you don't want to speak with them.

'Nothing happened between Alexis and me and I'm doing nothing wrong by revealing how he's been messaging me.

'But if I had said "yes" that time he phoned me and invited me out for a meal, I can assure you nobody would have found out.'

Sanchez has not yet responded to a request for comment from MailOnline.
