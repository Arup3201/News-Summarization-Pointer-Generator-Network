Smiling for the camera, former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and one-time presidential candidate Wesley Clark cuddles up to his rumoured new love, fashion entrepreneur Shauna Mei - who is nearly half his age.

The 68-year-old former General was more than happy to pose with 30-year-old Shauna Mei at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, last September - the same month that he filed for divorce from Gertrude, his wife of 46-years.

The image was posted up on the Facebook page on September 5, 2012, for Miss Mei's fashion site AHAlife.com, with the message 'Meanwhile, down in Charlotte, Shauna is hanging out with General Wesley Clark at the DNC'. General Clark filed for divorce in Arkansas on September 11, 2012.

The 38-year age difference has not stopped the pair from being seen publicly and looking 'affectionate' - and their latest venture out to the Hamptons, an exclusive beach getaway in New York, all but confirmed their relationship.

They were also pictured together at the 2013 Apex for Youth Inspiration Awards Gala in New York in May, with Miss Mei in a form-fitting red gown and Clark in a smart tux.

Clark also accompanied his new love to a New York fashion show in February and a friend told MailOnline: 'Shauna was very secretive about their relationship at that time.

'I'm not surprised by her dating older men but a bit surprised by so much older!'

Clark, who is known best for his leading role in ending the Kosovo war, filed for divorce from his wife Gertrude, with whom he has a son Wes Jr, last year and put an end to their 46-year marriage.

Now Clark and Miss Mei are being more open about their burgeoning romance.

In an interview in September 2010 with the Wall Street Journal, Miss Mei revealed she was living with a boyfriend in New York, but said she did not feel pressure to get married, adding: 'It's like a rule of thumb: You have to live with them before you decide.

'Marriage is not something that has to happen.'

However, in an interview  last year, she said that she was single.

A witness told The New York Post that the new couple were spotted making slight public displays of affection during a recent trip to the Hamptons.

The spy said they 'looked very affectionate, it was clear they were a couple. They were holding hands, they were not trying to hide their relationship.'

Heyday: Clark held a number of different leadership positions in the military over his storied career, including heading the U.S. forces in the Middle East and taking charge of the Kosovo war

Different line of work: Mei (second from left) started luxury sale site AHAlife.com after working as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs

Miss Mei was born in Mongolia and raised in China before moving to the United States.

She worked as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before leaving to venture into fashion merchandising, and she founded her luxury sale site.

Their beach getaway was not the only time that odd couple has been spotted together, as they attended an awards gala together one week after his divorce trial was scheduled.

Since retiring from the military in 2000, Clark's home base has been in Little Rock, Arkansas where he grew up.

Moving on: In September, Clark filed for divorce from his wife Gertrude (seen together in 2004) after 46-years of marriage

Minor win: Clark, seen here with Gertrude, won the New Hampshire primary in 2004 but went on to lose the nomination to John Kerry

The Post alleges that he stays with Mei whenever he visits her in New York, though neither would release a public comment about their relationship.

Miss Mei is not the only woman that Clark has shown his support for in recent months.

Clark, who ran for president as a Democrat in 2004, made a very early endorsement for his friend Hillary Clinton should she choose to run as the party's nominee.

He made his announcement in a June email sent to supporters of the 'Ready for Hillary' political action committee, and cited her international experience as one of her major strengths.

The endorsement comes as little surprise, as he backed her during her failed 2008 bid, and he is close with former President Bill Clinton from their work in the Kosovo war.
