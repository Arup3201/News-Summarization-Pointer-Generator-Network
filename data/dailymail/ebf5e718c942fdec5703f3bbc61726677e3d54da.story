They cut a large hole in the side of Sharon's house and then used their equipment to lift her from her bed and unto a trolley to remove her from the room and into the garden.

Rather than moving to an expensive skilled nursing facility, Sharon wants to work on losing weight with proper equipment that has been installed in her living room.

‘The crews and everybody have been so wonderful. They have all gone over and above, and it's made it a lot easier,’ she told KEZI9TV.

Neighbors in Eugene, Oregon, turned out to offer their support for Sharon Hall-Dodson as she left her bedroom for the first time in two years

Now that she has been moved to her living room, Sharon plans to start her physical therapy soon and hopes to walk again one day
