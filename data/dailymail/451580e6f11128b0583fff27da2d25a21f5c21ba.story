Ed Miliband’s leadership came under fire again last night after details of a row with outspoken Labour frontbencher Chris Bryant were revealed.

Mr Bryant, as Labour welfare spokesman, protested at a decision to crack down on the benefits rights of EU immigrants.

When Mr Miliband refused to back down, the fiercely pro-European Mr Bryant threatened to walk out of the Shadow Cabinet unless the party leader gave him another plum job.

So Mr Miliband gave in and moved Mr Bryant to what friends claim is his ‘perfect job’ as arts spokesman.

The secret deal avoided creating a damaging Labour rift but has led to fresh claims by the party’s MPs that Mr Miliband is ‘not tough enough’ to be Prime Minister and ‘too weak’ for Downing Street. One veteran Labour MP said: ‘If Miliband cannot summon the courage to sack someone like Chris Bryant, he will never command the respect of his team.’

The disclosure comes a month after Mr Miliband was mocked for the way he sacked Left-wing MP Diane Abbott, who was fired last year for repeatedly refusing to toe the line on party policy. Ms Abbott said that the Labour leader asked her if he was doing the ‘right thing’.

Sources said the Labour leader was so desperate to avoid a resignation over immigration policy that he ‘tamely’ agreed to move Mr Bryant to a new frontbench job.

The row broke out after Rachel Reeves, Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, unveiled plans last month to force jobless migrants from the EU to wait for two years before they could claim out-of-work benefits.

The move by Ms Reeves, then Mr Bryant’s boss, was designed to counter criticisms that Labour was ‘soft’ on immigration. However, the plans infuriated Mr Bryant, a former Europe Minister under the last Labour government.

Within a fortnight, he was moved from the welfare brief to the party’s culture, media and sport team.

Friends said: ‘Chris didn’t agree with the policy announced by Rachel and he made it very clear. He was ready to quit and said so, but instead, he was offered the arts post which, frankly, is a perfect job for Chris.’

They denied reports Mr Bryant had also found it difficult to work under Ms Reeves, who was only elected to the Commons in 2010.

Mr Bryant’s move was a little-noticed part of a wider reshuffle sparked by Shadow Attorney General Emily Thornberry’s resignation after she was accused of ‘snobbery’.

Ms Thornberry quit after tweeting a picture of a terraced house with three England flags and a white van outside it during a visit to Rochester where Mr Bryant was in charge of a Labour by-election campaign.

Last night, neither the Labour Party nor Mr Bryant were available for comment.
