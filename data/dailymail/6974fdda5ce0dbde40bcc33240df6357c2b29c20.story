Ally McCoist hailed match-winner Lewis Macleod on Saturday night for the spectacular piece of finishing that has eased some of the pressure on the Rangers manager.

McCoist entered Saturday’s Championship clash at Livingston fending off questions on his future and ended up enthusing at the quality of Macleod’s eighth-minute overhead finish that secured a 1-0 victory and ensured no further ground was lost on league-leaders Hearts.

It was not all good news, however, as the match was blighted by crowd trouble just before half-time.

Livingston safety officer Alan Scott later confirmed that five arrests had been made, following an incident in the away section of the ground, and there were also reports of post-match scuffles outside.

Macleod had been missing with an ankle injury as Rangers lost 3-1 to Hibs last Monday but his return helped galvanise the Ibrox men and McCoist admitted he could not recall scoring a comparable goal during his own prolific playing career.

‘I don’t remember striking too many with venom like that,’ he said. ‘I thought his one at Ayr United last season would take a bit of beating but that one might better it.’

Hearts’ 3-0 victory at Queen of the South ensures that Rangers remain six points off the top and McCoist acknowledged his own position will remain under scrutiny.

‘I don’t remember striking too many with venom like that,’ said McCoist after Macleod's fine overhead finish

‘I’ve tried to explain that sometimes there’s no real middle ground,’ he said. ‘With us, it’s either up there or down there but we have a reasonable concept of what’s going on and know our own jobs.’

Of the crowd trouble, safety officer Scott said: ‘There were five people arrested and they will be reported to the procurator fiscal in due course.’

McCoist said: ‘I did see it and it looked pretty unsavoury but, until I get a report on it, I would be loath to comment — but we can do without incidents like that.’
