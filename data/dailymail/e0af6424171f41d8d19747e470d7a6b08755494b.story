Tallahassee police are investigating Florida State University's starting running back in connection to a possible incident of domestic battery, the department said Monday in a press release.

Senior Karlos Williams is the target of a probe by investigators over an incident reported to police Saturday night involving Williams's live-in girlfriend.

ESPN reports that people close to the investigation have stated that the running back allegedly assaulted his girlfriend, who is pregnant with the couple's second child.

Investigation: Karlos Williams, pictured with girlfriend Miranda Wilhelm, is under investigation by Tallahassee police for domestic violence

On Friday night, Williams's girlfriend Miranda Wilhelm posted photos on Facebook showing bruises on her arms, with a message saying, 'I am ready to speak up for women in situations [like] myself.'

'This was done to me 2 nights ago by a man I have lived with for two years,' the post continued.

Jacksonville sports radio host Rick Ballou tweeted Friday morning that Williams had been suspended, though the university and team deny this.

'The athletics department is aware of an investigation by the Tallahassee Police Department involving football student-athlete Karlos Williams,' the school acknowledged in a statement.

'Until we receive more information regarding the alleged incident his status with the team will be under review,' the statement read.

FSU head coach Jimbo Fisher told reporters Friday that the rumors of Williams being suspended were 'false.'

Junior: Wilhelm and Williams have a son, Karlos Williams Jr, together and Wilhelm said she was pregnant in a Facebook post about the incident

Allegations: Wilhelm made a post on Facebook showing bruises on her arm, which she attributed to a 'man I have lived with for two years'

Lead rusher: Williams currently leads FSU's depth chart in rushing, with 378 yards over 82 carries with 7 touchdowns

Under scrutiny: Jameis Winston, FSU's starting quarterback, has also attracted negative attention for disciplinary problems and is currently under investigation by the university

'There's another false report, and that's amazing how things happen. Whoever has sources, whoever has rumors, needs to check who they are talking to — because that is about as far from truth as there is.'

Fisher also called Williams a 'tremendous kid, a tremendous ambassador' while saying he did not know where the report could have come from.

The Seminoles coach had similar praise for his  quarterback, Jameis Winston, who has been scrutinized for several disciplinary problems.

'Jameis is a tremendous person. He's a tremendous people person,' Fisher said during the L'Arche Mobile DEX Imaging Football Preview in Mobile, Alabama, back in May. 

'When you're around him, you get his magnetic personality. He loves people. He loves fans. He's great with kids. He's a tremendous human being,' Fisher added.

Winston was suspended for one game in September after he repeatedly screamed 'f--- her right in the p----' in the center of FSU campus.

The outburst, a reference to an Internet meme, was considered by some to be in poor taste, as Winston is being investigated for allegations stemming from a reported sexual assault in 2012.
