A 23-year-old who was confined to her bed for nine years has taken her first three steps towards independence.

Jessica Taylor, from Rochester in Kent, fell ill at the age of 14, after contracting a deadly virus.

It attacked her immune system, leaving the teenager with Myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) - a long-term disabling condition.

Sufferers struggle with bouts of fatigue, as well as muscular and joint pain, poor concentration and headaches.

Jessica Taylor beams as she stands for the first time in nine years. The 23-year-old was diagnosed with ME at the age of 14, and has been confined to bed ever since

Four of the nine years Jessica has been ill, have been spent in hospital

But today the former netball captain is celebrating taking her first few steps, spending nine years building up her strength.

'I had been pushing for this moment for nine years,' she said.

'I have spent almost a decade in bed, there have been times when I couldn't move and have been fed through a tube.

'Walking was just a dream but now it's a reality. As I stood up I realised I had grown by four inches.'

Despite only taking three steps, Jessica is hopeful that she will continue to improve and get her life back on track. 

She said: 'I've missed out on all my teenage years, that's the hardest part of having this condition.

'Shopping with friends and clubbing until the early morning is something I could only dream of doing.

'But with my latest development, I'm hopeful that one day I'll lead a normal life.'

Jessica who lives with her parents, Kate, 50, and Colin, 52, and sister, Ruby, 19, was an active teenager who loved socialising with friends before she was struck down with a viral infection.

She said: 'Since that moment my life has been an emotional rollercoaster for me and my family.

For two years Jessica (pictured in an ambulance) had to be fed through a tube and for 18 months she was unable to speak. She was also sensitive to light and sound so had to wear sunglasses and ear protectors

Jessica (pictured in hospital) has been in bed for so long she has developed severe osteoporosis and was told she has 'the bones of a 100-year-old'. The condition means she could break her back or a hip just by sitting up

Myalgic encephalomyelitis is a chronic condition that causes persistent fatigue that is not improved by sleep or rest.

Myalgic means muscle pain and encephalomyelitis means inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.

The
 condition can cause long-term illness and disability but many sufferers
 - particularly children and young people - improve over time.

It is estimated to affect about 250,000 people in the UK and is more common in women than men.

It usually develops in the early 20s to mid-40s but children can also be affected - usually between the ages of 13 and 15.

Most cases of ME are mild or moderate but up to one in four people with the condition have severe symptoms.

Aside from exhaustion, other symptoms include muscle pain, nausea, a sore throat, dizziness and sensitivity to light and sound.

It
 is not known what causes it but it could be linked to a viral 
infection, an immune system problem, a hormone imbalance or a 
psychological problem.

There
 is no cure but treatment options include cognitive behavioural therapy 
and medication to control pain and sleeping problems.

'It was a shock for everyone, I had gone from being an outgoing person to not being able to get out of bed.

'Everything changed, now the slightest infection can leave me fighting for my life.'

Jessica has been tube fed for weeks on end after being too weak to even lift her own head.

But now after being able to take a few steps unaided, Jessica's future looks bright.

She said: 'I heard of many miracle stories whereby people walk again but I never thought it would happen it me.

'I'm so proud of myself and all the hard work I put in to make my dream a reality.'

Jessica spent sixteen weeks in the Burrswood Centre, where staff specialise in helping those with ME.

There she underwent a treatment programme including leg physio and hydrotherapy..

She said: 'It was exhausting trying to build my muscles back up.

'It was all so worthwhile when I saw the look on my parents faces when I stood up and was able to take those few steps.

'They were so happy. Now I've managed to get out of bed the key is to keep on building up my muscles so I can walk for longer.'

Despite her ordeal, Jessica has always tried to help others living with ME.

Recently she launched her own website, Share a Star, to help children and young adults battling illness. 

After leaving hospital Jessica required round-the-clock care and has a carer for 12 hours a day

Jessica, pictured with her mother, Kate, was so weak and unused to sitting up that just being in a chair causes her to feel dizzy and nauseous

Jessica said: 'I set up the charity from my bed to help those in a similiar position to myself.

'I wanted to help others feel special, it also gave me something positive to focus on.'

Living with ME means Jessica's future is uncertain but she said she refuses to let it get her down.

She said: 'It's amazing that I have been able to walk after nine years, hopefully things will just keep getting better from here.'

Tony Britton from the ME Association said: 'This is a lovely story and we wish Jessica Taylor all the best in her recovery.

'But ME affects about 250,000 children and adults in the UK - many of whom can only hope and pray that they too will one day be able to receive the same kind of attention that she received through her stay at this private hospital.

'For vast numbers of severe sufferers, though, the reality is that they languish disbelieved and untreated because the NHS doesn't provide the care and understanding that people with this illness need to overcome its worst effects.

'They remain isolated and cut off from the rest of society because they are often too ill to leave their homes, they become bed bound and - in the worst cases - need to be fed by tube.

'Researchers are beginning get to grips with the causes of M.E., which can affect all bodily systems. The day when there are widely available treatments and perhaps even a cure can't come too soon.'

Jessica (pictured on her 21st birthday with her sister, Ruby, and brother, Tom) said:  'I think my illness made my sister miss out on a lot of her childhood - the illness affects the whole family'
