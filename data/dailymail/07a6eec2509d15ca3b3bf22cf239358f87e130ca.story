A police chase gone wrong has left a 25-year-old woman with 'potentially life-changing injuries' after a patrol car smashed into her hatchback early this morning.

Two officers were also injured when their Ford S-Max collided with two vehicles in Danbury, Essex, at 6.39am.

They were tailing a green Fiat Stilo estate which had been reported stolen from Suffolk when they hit a blue VW Beetle and a blue Toyota Aygo on the A414, Maldon Road.

Destroyed: The wreckage of a Toyota Aygo stands where a high speed police chase through Danbury, Essex, ended in a multiple collision this morning

Response: Paramedics attend to one of the three people hurt in this morning's crash. The 25-year-old woman driving the Toyota was airlifted to hospital with serious injuries

Essex Police said the woman driving the Aygo was airlifted to a London hospital. Both police officers were taken to Broomfield Hospital in Essex.

It is not thought that any of their injuries are life threatening.

A police spokeswoman said the Fiat Stilo stopped nearby and the two people inside ran off.

Two hours later, a 21-year-old was arrested in Danbury on suspicion of stealing a motor vehicle and is being questioned by detectives.

Aftermath: The woman's Toyota blocks the road next to a VW Beetle also involved in the smash. The Beetle's driver was not hurt but is said to have been 'badly shaken'

Investigation: A team at the crash scene document the site where a total of five cars including two civilian vehicles were damaged. Two people later abandoned the stolen car that officers were chasing

Police later confirmed the driver of the Aygo, from Maldon, Essex, suffered serious, 'potentially life-changing' injuries.

An Essex Police spokesman said: 'All the thoughts of every police officer concerned are with her and her family.'

The driver of the VW Beetle was 'badly shaken' but did not require hospital treatment.

Police said the crash is being investigated and officers have appealed for witnesses to come forward.

Chief Superintendent Tim Stokes said: 'Only specially trained police officers are able to carry out pursuits of other vehicles.

'Any decision to authorise a pursuit must be a reasonable and proportionate response to the crime or other issue and proper procedures must be followed, including proper command and control.'

Crumpled: A police Ford S-Max lies damaged after the collision. Essex Police said they are holding a 21-year-old in connection with the stolen car that officers had been pursuing
