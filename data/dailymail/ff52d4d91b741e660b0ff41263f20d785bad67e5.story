The fashion house Valentino has apologized for touting in an email blast to journalists that one of their pricey bags was carried by Amy Adams as she stepped from a car at the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Much was made of the promotional email sent Friday, complete with two photos of Adams outside the Thursday wake.

Valentino said in a statement that quickly followed that the company didn't realize the photos were snapped at the sad gathering of loved ones for Hoffman, who was found dead February 2 of an apparent heroin overdose in his apartment.

Solemn occasion: Amy Adams, her Valentino bag and her husband Darren Le Gallo attend the wake for Philip Seymour Hoffman in Manhattan Friday

We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media ... of Amy Adams with a Valentino Bag. We were not aware the photograph was taken while she was attending the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was an innocent mistake and we apologize to Ms. Adams who was not aware, or a part of, our PR efforts,' said the regretful statement signed by Mona Swanson, vice president of communications for Valentino USA.

The New York Post splashed the Valentino-toting actress all over its front page Saturday with the headline 'DEAD CARPET' after putting up the gaffe online, apparently prompting the apology.

The Daily News included the image of Adams with the red, $2,500 bag in a two-page spread inside the paper.Both Hoffman's wake and his funeral the next day were attended
 by numerous celebrities, Adams included.

A
 PR representative for Valentino issued a press release crowing over 
A-list actress Amy Adams carrying a bag made by the designer label while
 attending the wake.

The
 Valentino public relations executive Upasna Khosla emailed out a press 
release that read: 'We are pleased to announce Amy Adams carrying the 
Valentino Garavani Rockstud Duble bag from the Spring/Summer 2014 
collection on Feb. 6 in New York.'

It was accompanied by two pictures of a grieving Adams with her head down, wearing sunglasses and a sombre expression.

Bag lady: Adams may not now be so fond of her designer bag

Adams, who recently broke down in tears while speaking to students on Inside the Actors Studio about working with Hoffman, is disgusted by the PR stunt.

The actress' representative called the tasteless ploy 'truly appalling.'

'Amy Adams is not a paid spokesperson for Valentino and the suggestion she would use this moment to participate in a promotion is truly appalling,' the spokesperson told Page Six.

Adams wore a red halterneck Valentino gown to this year's Golden Globes, where she picked up the award for Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy but it now seems unlikely she'll choose the designer for the upcoming Academy Awards.

Adams, who is nominated in this year's awards for best actress for her role in American Hustle, co-starred with Hoffman in the 2012 Oscar-nominated film The Master, 2008's Doubt and Charlie Wilson's War in 2007.

Hoffman was due to direct Adams in Ezekiel Moss, a period piece, sometime this year.

The company issued an apology for the press release late Friday afternoon.

'We sincerely regret releasing a photo to the media this morning of Amy Adams with a Valentino bag,' said Valentino spokeswoman Mona Swanson.

'We were not aware the photograph was taken while she was attending the wake of Philip Seymour Hoffman. It was an innocent mistake and we apologize to Ms. Adams who was not aware, or a part of, our PR efforts.'

The untimely death of Philip Seymour Hoffman has seen some of Hollywood's biggest stars descend on New York City to pay their respects.

Today's memorial service saw the likes of Cate Blanchett, Diane Keaton, Joaquin Phoenix, Meryl Streep, Michelle Williams, Jake Gyllenhaal, Ethan Hawke, Marisa Tomei and many more in attendance.

Page Six reports that Valentino wasn't the only fashion company to try to cash in on the celebrity gathering.

Ugg Australia sent their signature woolly boots to friends of Hoffman, in the hopes they'd be photographed wearing them around New York.

'They did gifting in the hopes that that would happen,' an Ugg associate told Page Six.

'Since they knew a ton of celebs were in New York City and the weather sucks.'Â
