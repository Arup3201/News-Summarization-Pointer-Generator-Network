President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle are on the lookout for minimum-wage jobs for their teenage daughters so they can give them a feeling of what 'most folks go through every single
 day.'

'We are looking for 
opportunities for them to feel as if  going to work and getting a 
paycheck is not always fun, not  always stimulating, not always fair,' 
the president said in an interview  with Parade magazine, 
slated to run on Sunday.

'I 
think every kid needs to get a taste of what it's like to  do that real 
hard work,' Michelle echoed.

Instilling good values? President Obama and his wife Michelle are on the lookout for minimum-wage jobs for their teenage daughters, for them to get a sense of what 'most folks go through every day'

Both the president and the first lady worked minimum-wage jobs 
before they got law  degrees: an experience they said 
they also  want their teenage daughters -  Malia, 16, and Sasha, who turned 13 this month -  to share.

The
 president scooped ice cream at Baskin-Robbins, waited  tables at an 
assisted-living facility for seniors and also  worked as a painter. The 
first lady worked at a book binding  shop.

It is unclear what sort of careers paths Malia and Sasha have their eyes set on beyond their destined minimum wage experiences, but Malia was recently spotted on the set of a CBS 
 television program, working as a production assistant for a day.

Given that the president and the first lady have kept an eagle eyed watch on their daughters since they entered the White House, shielding them from public scrutiny as much as possible, it also remains unclear how they propose to land them jobs among the 'normal folk' Obama refers to. 

Straight talking: Obama, pictured with Malia, 16, (left) and Sasha, 13, (right), is keen for his daughters to learn that 'getting a paycheck is not always fun, not always stimulating, not always fair'

In the
 interview, the Obamas also talked about how, for a year after law 
school, they lived with Mrs Obama's mom, Marian  Robinson, on the second floor of her house, drove a used car that they bought for  $1,000, and worked 
through the stress of being saddled with  student loans and small 
children.

'Getting a 
paycheck is not always fun, not  always stimulating, not always fair'

They acknowledged that their careers 
gave them the chance to  earn good incomes and negotiate family leave 
when they needed it  - a luxury that most minimum-wage workers do not 
have.

'But what it made me think about was people
 who were on the  clock,' the president said. 'If you're an hourly 
worker in most  companies, and you say, "I've got to take three days 
off," you  may lose your job. At minimum, you're losing income you can't
  afford to lose.'

Giving back: Earlier this year, the president took Sasha (right) with him to participate in a community service project at the D.C. Central Kitchen

The
 Obamas gave the interview to promote a summit the White  House is 
holding on Monday to discuss policies to help working  families.

'There
 are structures that can help families around child  care, healthcare, 
and schooling that make an enormous difference  in people's lives,' 
Obama said in the interview.

This
 year, the president has tried to focus on issues such as  ensuring equal pay 
for women, expanding early childhood  education and hiking the minimum 
wage. These issues so far have  failed to gain traction in Congress, but
 do resonate with  Democratic voters.

To advance 
his agenda, he needs Democrats to keep control of  the Senate after 
November's midterm elections and regain control of the House of
 Representatives.

'If we can highlight these 
issues and sustain it over the  next year, it's still possible to see 
bold action out of  Congress,' Obama said.

Republicans stand a good chance of taking away the Senate and are likely to keep the House.

During the interview with Parade the Obama's also showed off their lighter side, and the president revealed that early in their marriage Michelle had to teach him how to do laundry.

'I wouldn’t fold,' the president said. 'I didn’t separate, and Michelle’s point was, that’s not laundry.'

Cleaning the bathroom wasn't one of the president's strengths, either.

'I was usually the bill payer, the grocery shopper, and generally the dishwasher. Michelle was -usually the bathroom cleaner, just because she didn’t think I did a good enough job,' he said, laughing.

'There were certain things she just didn’t trust me to do.'
