For cyclists wanting to maintain their hair, an inflatable collar might be quite appealing.

But one company claim their airbag helmet is not only a worthwhile fashion accessory - it's also considerably safer than a regular bike helmet.

In Hövding's new video, they outline just why you should stump up the cash for their fancy new collar and throw your old rigid head protector in the bin.

Scroll down for video

Hövding's collar (left) inflates when it detects unnatural movement (right), protecting your head as you fall to the ground in an accident (or just being a nuisance when you brake too quickly)

The video shows a number of studies into Hövding's rather unusual helmet.

The Swedish makers say that many modern bike helmets only just comply with European regulations.

But their helmet apparently performed considerably better in testing, making it three times safer than traditional helmets.

They go on to state that, using their inflatable helmet, the risk of fatal head injuries resulting from accidents can be reduced to almost zero.

Their helmet is so much better, they say, that if the tests were redone with Hövding as the standard then all other bike helmets would be obsolete.

One of the graphs in the video shows the chances of serious injury occurring when wearing the inflatable helmet (left) compared to a traditional helmet (right) in an accident

The airbag, designed like a hood, is made of nylon fabric.

With a traditional cycle helmet in a serious accident, the likelihood of serious head injury is approximately 90% according to Hövding.

The risk of a fatal injury can even be as high as 30%.

The use of an airbag cycle helmet in the same accident dramatically reduces the risk of injury.

The risk of serious head injury is then only 2% and the risk of a fatal injury almost non-existent.

This means that when it scrapes across the ground it won’t rip.

It also covers a larger area of the head than a regular bike helmet, providing more protection.

Pressure within the helmet stays constant for a few seconds, so it can withstand multiple impacts.

It is inflated by helium that is held in a holder in the back of the collar.

One obstacle to this being the gold standard in head protection might be the price, however.

At £299 ($500) it's not exactly cheap and, after it has been inflated once, you can't use it again.

But it might be a small price to pay for cyclists to keep themselves safe on the roads.

Or, at the very least, it'll provide some amusement for bystanders if it inflates accidentally while you're cycling along.

The helmets are stored inside 'stylish' scarves that come in a variety of colours and patterns. The airbag, designed like a hood, is made of nylon fabric
