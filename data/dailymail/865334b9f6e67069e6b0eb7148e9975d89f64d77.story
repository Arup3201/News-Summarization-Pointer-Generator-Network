The 'Peking Man', an ancient human ancestor that lived between 750,000 and 200,000 years ago, was an expert at lighting fires.

Discovered in Zhoukoudian, south west of modern Beijing in 1923, the so-called Peking Man’s fire making capabilities have, up until now, been merely a theory.

Now, researchers have solid proof of the skill after analysing ash from the archaeological site known locally as ‘Dragon Bone Hill’.

This is the latest piece of a puzzle that scientists have been putting together over the past decade to build up a remarkable account of what life was like for the early human.

Recent age determinations have shown that Peking Man lived in the area around 770,000 year ago, when weather conditions in North China were relatively cold.

In order to survive the harsh weather, Peking Man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire. This theory been widely accepted since 1931.

To test this idea, Dr Gao Xing, from the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology (IVPP) in China, looked at four soil samples obtained from the site.

His team demonstrated that all four samples contained siliceous aggregates as well as elemental carbon, and the potassium content of the insoluble residues.

They claim this analysis provides ‘very strong’ evidence for the onsite use of fire by Peking Man.

In order to survive the harsh weather, Peking Man would have needed to be able to create and manage fire, and now there is solid proof to back this theory.

The Peking Man was outfitted, wearing animal hides that had been softened using stone tools.

Belonging to the species Homo erectus, the Peking Man was also able to make bizarrely drilled holed in objects for as yet unknown reasons.

‘At present, the key point of the debate over the intentional use of fire by Homo erectus pekinensis at Zhoukoudian is whether or not siliceous aggregate (an insoluble phase of burned ash) is present in ash remains recovered from the site’, said Dr Xing.

The re-excavation, in the village of Zhoukoudian, near Beijing, has unearthed fascinating details proving our ancestors were more advanced than previously believed.

Using powerful microscopes, the scientists have also examined tools used by the Peking Man to gain more details about their use.

Scientists from the Chinese Academy of Science said that a 3,000-year-old living room, or 'activity floor', had been discovered in the cave, containing what could be a fireplace.

Chen Shen, a curator at the Toronto Museum and a special member of the academy, said that it was also likely the species had attached stone points to sticks, creating spears.

The discovery could be significant as it shows the Peking Man potentially joining two materials to form a tool.

The Chinese cave system is one of the most important Palaeolithic sites ever discovered.

Archaeologists unearthed thousands of stone tools and hundreds of fragmentary remains from about 40 early humans as they worked on the site between 1921 and 1966.

The human remains discovered in the cave were later assigned to the species Homo erectus.

The original fossils of the Peking Man vanished in 1941 as they were being transported to America at the peak of World War II.

A number of techniques have attempted to accurately date the remains numerous times over the years but have failed to find a definitive answer.

The famous Peking Man skull went missing after in 1941 when it was being transported to the U.S. from China during WWII. Scientists have revisited the site to discover more details about our ancient ancestor

Swedish 
scientist Johan Gunnar Andersson and American colleague Walter W. 
Granger first arrived in Zhoukoudian in 1921 where they were directed to
 the site by quarrymen.

Upon arrival at the cave Andersson announced: 'Here is primitive man, now all we have to do is find him.'

The
 confidence was well-founded as the scientists had just discovered what 
would become one of the most important paleontological sites in the 
world.

Anderrson
 found human molars at the site but it was Canadian scientist Davidson 
Black who made some of the most significant discoveries, despite his 
initial findings being treated with scepticism by scientists around the 
world.

Around 200 fossils were gathered until excavation came to an end in 1937 with the Japanese invasion.

Fossils
 were placed in the Cenozoic Research Laboratory of the Peking Union 
Medical College for safe-keeping, before being packed up for the U.S. in
 1941.

But the fossils were inexplicably lost as they were being transported through northern China.

It is still unknown what happened to the fossils with some believing they sank on Japanese ship the Awa Maru in 1945.

U.S.
 financier Christopher Janus appealed for information on their 
whereabouts in 1972, promising a reward of $5,000. One woman made 
contact, demanding $500,000, but this failed to materialise.

The
 Chinese Government also initiated a committee to locate the fossils to 
coincide with the 60th anniversary of the end of WWII.The fossils, however, have yet to be located.
