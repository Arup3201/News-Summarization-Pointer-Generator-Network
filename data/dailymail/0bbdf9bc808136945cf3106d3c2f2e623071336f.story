A 16-year-old has been charged with murder after his pregnant girlfriend was shot in what police believe was a drug deal that went wrong.

Anthony Lee and his brother Diante Lamont Coakley, 21, were arrested after Eva Casara was found in an alley on Christmas Day.

Police believe Eva who was five and a half months pregnant, wasn't an intentional victim, but have not said if the shooting was accidental.

The 17-year-old died but doctors were able to save her baby girl, who is in critical condition in hospital.

Eva was 'just in the wrong place at 
the wrong time with the wrong company,' Dolton Police Chief John 
Franklin told the Chicago Sun Times.

Lee and Coakley were allegedly attempting a drug deal that 'spiraled out of control' resulting in the brothers both firing their guns.

Eva was shot in the back of the head in the exchange, described as a deal that 'spiraled out of control'.

'It’s hard to call it an accident when 
you’re firing a gun in the direction of people. Our 
information is that all of the subjects charged were firing in the 
direction where she was hit,' Chief Franklin said.

Fighter: Doctors were able to save Eva's baby girl, who was born more than three months premature

Dreams: Eva, 17, was looking forward to becoming a mother and had planned to study to become a nurse

Police are still looking for a third person in connection with the case.

It is thought that after she was shot Eva was moved to the snow-covered alley where she was later found.

Her aunt, Melody Vargas, said her niece was not involved in drug deals, adding: 'She was just a victim of their stupidity, and they need to pay for it.'

She added that Eva and Lee were in love and she had been excited at the prospect of becoming a mother.

A candlelit vigil was held for Eva on Saturday at the teenager's family released a video of her premature baby, who weighed about 1lb when doctors delivered her.

'I love my grand baby she’s fighting, fighting so hard,' Eva's mother Estrellita Casara told WGNTV.

Grief: Estrellita Casara said her daughter was beautiful inside and out

The family plan to 
name her Lailani Paris – a name Eva herself had picked after learning 
she was having a girl, Chicago Tribune reported. 

The victim's mother said: ‘Everywhere [Eva] goes, she just lights up the 
place. She's as beautiful inside as she is outside.'

Eva's grandmother, Fannie Casara, who was Eva's legal guardian, described the teenager as a bright girl who loved reading, was planning to get her GED and then go to college to study nursing.

'They treated her like a dog and just shot her in the back of the head,' her grandmother told Chicago Sun-Times.
