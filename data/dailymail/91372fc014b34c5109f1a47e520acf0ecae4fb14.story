A woman hailed as a leading architect of anti-stalking legislation has reported her former campaign partner to the police – for alleged stalking.

Laura Richards, 39, the civilian former head of Scotland Yard's controversial Homicide Prevention Unit, has made the astonishing allegations against Harry Fletcher, 68.

The pair worked together advising MPs and senior police officers on the 2012 Protection of Freedoms Act, which specifically outlawed stalking.

Ms Richards was involved in the charity Protection Against Stalking (PAS) and they both became fellow directors of a not-for-profit company called Paladin, which advises victims.

Police have already interviewed Mr Fletcher, a former official of probation officers' union Napo, who is married with children. He strongly denies the allegations.

Friends of his claim that Ms Richards – who calls herself a 'criminal behavioural analyst' – is deploying some of the key weapons in the stalker's armoury of smear, innuendo and character assassination.

Ms Richards told The Mail on Sunday that Mr Fletcher was 'obsessed' with her and stalked her when she spurned his advances. She said: 'He has rummaged through every part of my life, my friends, my relationships, my work colleagues. I feel really violated.

'He made out that we were in an intimate relationship and told people he was worried about my mental health.

'He would call me all the time, sometimes 50 times a day, and would never leave a message, always keep ringing until I picked up.

'It's ironic we have both achieved domestic violence law reform on coercive control, the very thing that he's been doing to me through his stalking behaviour, and that's been the problem. I've had sleepless nights. It's changed me. I shall never be the person I was.'

Mr Fletcher, who voluntarily attended Brixton Police Station in South London with his solicitor in November to be interviewed about the complaint, said last night: 'I completely and utterly deny these allegations and have fully co-operated with the police. I look forward to their inquiry reaching its conclusion.'

His supporters say Ms Richards's allegations are groundless and stem from professional jealousy over his standing in the field of stalking and domestic violence legislation.

Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd, who was the chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on stalking and worked with Ms Richards on legislation, said: 'I found her difficult to work with. She was making some rather strange allegations against Harry. I found her accusations to be utterly incredible.'

Senior forensic psychiatrist Dr David James, who was on the board of PAS, described Ms Richards as 'reacting extravagantly when crossed'.

He added: 'I resigned from the board of PAS because I feared that any form of association with her would be harmful to my professional reputation.

'I was aware she has made complaints of harassment against others in the past.'

Mr Fletcher is now a director of Digital-Trust, which advises on cyber stalking.

Fellow director Jennifer Perry said: 'Harry has been given advice and emotional support as a stalking victim himself. Spreading malicious allegations about someone is one of the stalker's weapons.'

Ms Richards led the Homicide Prevention Unit, which aimed to draw up a list of the most high-profile 'future offenders' based on past records and psychological profiling.

In 2006 she said: 'It is trying to pick up Ian Huntley before he goes out and commits that murder.'

A Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'An allegation of harassment has been made by a 38-year-old woman. [Ms Richards was 38 at the time of her complaint]. A man has been interviewed under caution and the police investigation continues.'
