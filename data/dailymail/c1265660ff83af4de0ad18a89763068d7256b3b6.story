An aspiring teen football coach and his 18-year-old accomplice who videoed their sexual assault on a 'vulnerable' drunk 14-year-old girl have been jailed for just three years each.

Teejay Walker, 17, and David Lingard, 18, abused the young teenage girl when she was in a 'drunken stupour' at a New Year's Eve party in Burnley this year.

Lingard, then 17, had intercourse with the girl, despite her being 'clearly unconscious', while Walker photographed the incident on his mobile phone as the pair'clearly enjoyed' the abuse.

Abusers: Teejay Walker, 17, left, and David Lingard, 18, right, carried out the sexual abuse on the 14-year-old girl despite her being 'clearly unconscious'

A judge told the pair they 'chose to ignore the standards of morality' in abusing the girl by laughing and posing as they recorded the sexual assault.

Walker was even said to have threatened to to post the photos of the incident on the internet, Burnley Crown Court heard.

The duo are able to be identified after Judge Lunt ruled there should be no reporting restrictions on their names because they are 'not children but young men'.

Police only became aware of the 'horrible' abuse when the victim told a teacher at her school what had happened.

Lingard and Walker both from Burnley, admitted sexual activity with a child, sexual assault and taking indecent photos of a child and were each sentenced to three years and four months.

Judge Beverley Lunt allowed identification of Walker and Lingard after ruling they were 'young men, not children'

Both will be on the sex offenders’ register indefinitely. Lawyers for Walker applied for a court order banning him from being publicly identified as he is under 18.

But Judge Lunt, 58, refused and told the boys:'You both knew the girl was clearly under the influence of alcohol and was vulnerable and a non custodial sentence would be wholly against the interests of justice.

'You are not children. You are young men. You chose to ignore standards of morality and the law and to commit these offences.'

Earlier Mark Savill, prosecuting, said the offences took place at a house in Burnley on January 1 this year.

Walker and Lingard got into bed and asked the victim to get in with them. She was wearing clothes at that point and the teenagers started to undress her.

The prosecutor said : 'She puts herself as very, very, very drunk at this point.' Walker then performed a sex act on the girl and Lingard had sex with her.

At this point the girl became aware Walker was taking photographs. One of the pictures was a level 4 indecent picture - just one below the most serious level - and showed Lingard having sex with the schoolgirl.

Three others were taken later and showed the boys showing off their private parts and' a young woman who is plainly unconscious.'

In mitigation for Lingard, defence counsel Martin Hackett said alcohol was not used by either defendant to facilitate the offence.

The barrister continued : 'His actions in the early hours of Jan 1 this year were, and indeed are, wholly out of character for this young man.

'He will now have to face his punishment for his disgraceful and serious behaviour over that short period of time.

'This was a one-off offence, a bad and serious offence, an offence which will mean he loses his liberty, but the sentence could be kept as short as possible. His parents are devastated at their son’s behaviour.'

Burnley Crown Court heard Walker and Lingard 'both knew the girl was under the influence of alcohol and vulnerable'

James Heyworth, defending Walker, said :' This is wholly and exceptionally out of character for him.

'There is no real explanation for what happened. It happened. It was horrible, he is sorry for what he has done. He cannot turn back the clock. He cannot put it right.'

Mr Heyworth said character references spoke of Walker as being 'kind and generous’. He had wanted to be a football coach, but that would not now happen.
