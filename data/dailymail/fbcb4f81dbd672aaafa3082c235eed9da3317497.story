Young adults taking high-dose antidepressants such as Prozac and Seroxat have double the risk of suicidal behaviour, warn researchers.

A U.S. study of almost 162,000 found those aged 24 or younger were twice as likely to deliberately self-harm compared with youngsters taking standard doses of SSRI pills.

Older adults were not at higher risk of suicidal behaviour after starting to take antidepressants.

The latest study investigating the effect of antidepressants known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors comes from experts at Harvard School of Public Health, Boston.

Because the benefits of medication for youngsters suffering depression are 'modest', they claim, doctors should avoid giving them high doses and monitor them closely for several months.

Suicide warnings are included on medication in the U.S. and the British drug safety watchdog advises doctors to 'carefully monitor' young adults during treatment for any worsening of symptoms of suicidal behaviour.

Previous studies found antidepressant drugs are linked with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour and thoughts in children and adolescents, particularly in the early stages of treatment.

A British Medical Journal study in 2009 found young adults taking antidepressants including SSRIs had double the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviour compared with those taking dummy pills.

Doctors are advised not to prescribe the majority of SSRIs to under-18s and NHS guidelines recommend cognitive therapy, which teaches patients to change behaviour patterns, as first-line treatment for mild to moderate depression.

Older adults are not at increased risk of becoming suicidal when taking high doses of the drugs

The latest study used data from 162,625 people between the ages of 10 to 64 years with depression who started treatment with SSRIs such as Prozac and Seroxat.

They compared those on an average dose or at higher amounts from 1998 to 2010.

The rate of suicidal behaviour among children and adults of 24 years or younger who started antidepressant therapy at high doses was about twice as high compared with a matched group of patients who received generally prescribed doses.

The authors suggest this corresponds to about one additional act of deliberate self-harm for every 150 patients treated with high-dose therapy.

For adults 25 to 64 years old, there was no difference in risk for suicidal behaviour, says a report in JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study did not explain why higher doses might lead to higher suicide risk.

Study leader Dr Matthew Miller said recent scientific reviews of antidepressant therapy found young patients only got modest benefits.

'Our findings offer clinicians an additional incentive to avoid initiating pharmacotherapy at high-therapeutic doses and to monitor all patients starting antidepressants, especially youth, for several months,' he said.

Soaring levels of antidepressant use led to more than 50 million prescriptions being issued on the NHS in 2012.

Of these more than half were for drugs such as Prozac and Seroxat.

Dr Irene Petersen, Reader in Epidemiology, Department of Primary Care and Population Health, UCL, said it was likely that young people needing high dose medication had more severe problems.

She said: 'Young people prescribed high dose antidepressants are likely to be different from those who were prescribed standard dose.

The suicide risk in young people taking the drugs, which include Prozac, is particularly high during the first weeks of taking them

'We cannot be sure that the observed increase in self-harm is solely due to high dose antidepressants.

'An alternative, but equally valid, interpretation is that high dose antidepressant is a mere marker of young people with acute severe psychiatric problems and thus it is the underlying condition not the treatment that is associated with increased risks of self-harm.'

Professor David Nutt, speaking on behalf of the European College for Neuropsychopharmacology, said: 'We need to be clear that this is about starting antidepressant therapy at a high dose - the work shows that normal doses are not a significant problem.

'Nevertheless, this will help doctors optimise the doses in younger people, and clinicians should take note.'
