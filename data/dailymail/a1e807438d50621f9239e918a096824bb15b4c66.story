Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd led a chorus of calls for Maria Miller to quit ‘as a matter of honour’ last night.

Her comments came as even close allies of David Cameron said the Culture Secretary should offer to leave the Cabinet following the row over her expenses.

Baroness Boothroyd, a widely respected figure across all parties, said the Prime Minister had made ‘an error of judgment’ by allowing Mrs Miller to remain.

Former Commons Speaker Betty Boothroyd tonight called for Maris Miller to be sacked from the Cabinet,

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 she said she was 'surprised' the Culture Secretary did not quit at the weekend.

She added: 'My concern is that Parliament has taken hard knocks for a long time... and this does not help at all.

'It
 is a matter of honour. People in the past, leading members of 
government, leading Members of Parliament have resigned, and I think it 
is for Mrs Miller to have done likewise.

'And
 I’m sad to say that I regard it as an error of judgement on the part of
 the Prime Minister that he didn’t quietly say to her: "I think it’s 
time to go – thank you for your services, but I think it’s time to go".'

The embattled Culture Secretary 
launched a concerted attempt to cling to her job, sending her chief 
Parliamentary aide Mary Macleod on to the airwaves to condemn continued 
media coverage as ‘unnecessary and unacceptable’.

But
 Mrs Macleod only poured fuel on the flames by claiming the minister was
 the victim of a ‘witch hunt’ because of her involvement in the Leveson 
reforms of Press regulation and legislating for gay marriage.

The
 Culture Secretary used a column in her local newspaper, the Basingstoke
 Gazette, to broaden her widely criticised 32-second apology in the 
Commons last week after being ordered to repay £5,800 in overclaimed 
mortgage costs.

‘I am devastated that this has happened, and that I have let you down,’ she told constituents.

But
 last night, Mrs Miller’s appeal appeared to be falling on deaf ears, as
 the Basingstoke Gazette’s website was overwhelmed with almost 
universally negative comments from readers.

Mr
 Cameron appeared determined to stand by Mrs Miller, despite a growing 
number of Tory MPs insisting publicly that she should go ahead of a 
meeting of the Parliamentary party today. 

Downing
 Street again pointed out  she had been cleared of the central 
allegation against her – that she set out to cheat taxpayers to fund a 
property lived in by her parents.

But
 ominously for Mrs Miller, who was found to have overclaimed for 
mortgage costs and condemned for her attitude to a sleaze inquiry, even 
some senior allies of the Prime Minister now believe she should quit due
 to the damage being done to her party.

Culture Secretary Maria Miller arrived in Downing Street for this morning's Cabinet meeting and went straight from her car into Number 10 without turning to photographers

Ex-Speaker Betty Boothroyd:
 'I think it is a matter of honour - a question of honour, quite 
honestly. I regard it as an error of judgement on the part of the Prime 
Minister that he didn’t quietly say to her: "I think it’s time to go."'

A Conservative MP: 'I think Maria has probably had it, I'm afraid. I think she is toast.'

Tory minister Esther McVey: 'I can honestly say it wouldn't be how I would have made an apology'

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith: 'It would be the Prime Minister's decision who he surrounds himself with. I am surprised that Maria Miller hasn't stepped down

Tory MP Jackie Doyle-Price: 'If I was in 
that position facing a difficult set of local elections, I wouldn’t be 
expecting my colleagues to defend me.'

Tory MP Matthew Offord: 'Knocking on doors in my constituency this weekend people did raise the 
expenses issue with me and they believe that nothing has changed.'

Tory MP Nicola Blackwood:  'I have to say if I
 was faced with the kind of questions that she is faced with, I would be
 really quite worried indeed.'

One
 said privately: ‘If she had a shred of self-awareness, she would have 
offered to go. It might not be fair, but life is not fair.’

Baroness Boothroyd said: ‘I’m very disagreeably surprised Mrs Miller did not resign at the weekend when all this blew up.

‘This
 was the time that I think she should have gone to the Prime Minister 
and said that she thought she ought to relinquish her Cabinet position, 
and I think the Prime Minister should have been gracious enough to 
accept that.’

The former 
Speaker added: ‘I think it is a matter of honour – a question of honour 
... All my life I’ve wanted to protect our Parliamentary system, which I
 cherish, and I think that Mrs Miller is bringing it into disrepute.’

Parliamentary
 private secretary Mrs Macleod insisted sections of the media had 
ulterior motives in calling for Mrs Miller to resign.

She said: ‘There are journalists outside Maria’s house, I think, harassing her children and her parents.’

Bizarrely, a source close to Mrs Miller later tried to disown her aide’s remarks, saying: ‘Maria has never expressed that view.’

Despite
 the fightback, a significant number of Tory MPs believe Mrs Miller must
 go. There is particular concern in marginal seats, where a few votes 
could cost the party dear.

A survey suggested a quarter of Conservatives representing such constituencies believe the Culture Secretary should quit.

Richmond MP Zac Goldsmith said he was ‘surprised’ Mrs Miller had not stepped down from the Cabinet.

Nicola Blackwood said if she was in Mrs Miller's position she 'would be really quite worried indeed'; Zac Goldsmith said he was 'surprised' Mrs Miller was still in her job; Jackie Doyle-Price said Mrs Miller could not expect her colleagues to defend her

He
 said the allegations against her demonstrated the need for a system of 
‘recall’, where voters can trigger a by-election if an MP has been found
 to have broken the members’ code of conduct.

‘In
 a mature and functioning democracy, her constituents should be able to 
hold her to account at all times, and not just at the election,’ Mr 
Goldsmith added.

Shipley MP 
Philip Davies said: ‘Obviously the whole thing is extremely damaging for
 the Conservative Party, it’s damaging for Parliament as a whole and 
politicians.

The sooner the matter is resolved the better.’

Jackie
 Doyle-Price, who is defending Thurrock, the most marginal Conservative 
constituency in the country, said: ‘I’ll just make this point: faced 
with a difficult set of elections, I would not be expecting colleagues 
to defend me.’

Grassroots 
party members called for Mrs Miller to resign. Brian Leversha, Chairman 
of the Aldershot and North Hampshire Conservative Association, said: ‘I 
think anybody that has that sort of thing hanging over them should make 
their own decision to stand aside.

‘She has upset a lot of people by what she has done and I think Cameron has misjudged it by standing by her.’

However, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said Mrs Miller should ‘absolutely not’ resign.

She
 added: ‘I think this issue has been ruled on, I think we should move on
 I think Maria Miller is an excellent Secretary of State and she should 
be left to get on with her job.

'There’s been a ruling by the appropriate authorities, it has been complied with.’

Boris Johnson, visiting Imperial College London today, said only that Mrs Miller was being 'hounded' before adding: 'How about that?'
