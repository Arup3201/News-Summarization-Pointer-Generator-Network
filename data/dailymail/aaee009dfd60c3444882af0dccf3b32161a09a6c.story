Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin is delighted by the fighting spirit in the camp as the reigning Primera Division champions aim to continue their recent good form.

Los Rojiblancos take on promoted and winless Cordoba at the Vicente Calderon stadium on Saturday evening seeking a seventh win in eight games in all competitions.

Uruguayan skipper Godin has marshalled an Atletico defence which has not conceded in any of their last three games, since a 3-1 loss at Valencia.

Atletico Madrid captain Diego Godin believes his side are growing stronger each day as a group

He is encouraged to see that the team have lost none of the fighting qualities which helped them to win the league title last season.

'We become stronger day by day and we know that the strength of our group is our environment and our people,' he told the club's official website www.clubatleticodemadrid.com.

'We discard anything that is negative. Anything that could create divisions in the group, we discard it and it makes us stronger. We are accustomed to fighting and fighting like last year. Nothing will divert us from day to day and now we only think of Cordoba.'

Cordoba were promoted via the play-offs last season having finished seventh in the Segunda Division, and have drawn five and lost four of their nine league games so far to sit 18th out of 20 in the early top-flight standings.

Despite that, Godin is taking nothing for granted.

'To us there are no easy games. All matches we face are the same,' he added.

'It's like a final for us. We will try to continue to get stronger at home.'

Midfielder Gabi (thigh) and defender Cristian Ansaldi (hamstring) are set to return for Atletico after both missed last weekend's win at Getafe.

Cordoba will be without Jose Carlos Fernandez due to injury. Their coach Miroslav Djukic told the club's official website www.cordobacf.com: 'We will go to Madrid with the intention to be a threat to our opponents and to try to win the game.

'I want to see a team that is bold and gives everything out there on the pitch.'
