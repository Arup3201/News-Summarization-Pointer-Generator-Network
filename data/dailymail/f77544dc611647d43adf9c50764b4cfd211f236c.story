A monstrous Halloween storm will inflict torrential rains, howling winds and booming thunderstorms from Texas to the Midwest and as far as the Northeast, forecasters have predicted.

It will mean wet and windy celebrations for trick-or-treaters across the U.S., with as many as 42 million people battling thunderstorms across cities including Nashville, Houston, Cincinnati and Indianapolis.

The thunderstorms could be capable of dropping several inches of rain in just a few hours, sparking flash flooding from eastern Texas into the lower Mississippi Valley, Accuweather reported.

High winds could also down trees and power lines across the eastern Great Lakes into the upper Ohio Valley into the Northeast, the Weather Channel warned.

Forecasters warned residents against going near downed power lines as they could be live and dangerous.

'Damaging winds and some tornadoes will be possible with what should be a complex and potentially messy storm,' the Storm Prediction Center predicted, USA Today reported.

'The potential for widespread damaging windsâ€¦ and possibly a few tornadoes will increase throughout the day.'

'The best costume in Houston for Halloween probably involves a garbage bag to keep dry,' WeatherBell meteorologist Ryan Maue said, warning it could be the wettest Halloween ever for some.

Due to the forecast, some towns in Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana moved Halloween events to Friday or the weekend.

Forecasters also warn that heavy rains may put a dampener on plans in Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh and Burlington, Vermont.

Heavy winds are also expected to batter the country, with Lakes Erie and Ontario expected to see gusts of 60 mph into the early hours of Friday, AccuWeather reported.

Coupled with the wet ground, trees could topple.

The East Coast, including Boston, Washington D.C. and New York City, will see a calmer Halloween but will still be lashed with rains late on Thursday.

And on the West, revelers will mostly see a dry night, bar a few showers across Seattle and Portland.

Late-October storms this size usually bring snow to the northern parts of the country but a lack of cold air will prevent any snow east of the Rockies, Accuweather reported.

The stormy conditions are expected to continue into Friday, with severe storms expected along the Southeast, and further north, heavy rain and strong wind gusts will move through the Northeast.

Heavy rain and wind from Boston to New York City and Philadelphia could also make for a devilish commute along the I-95 corridor on Friday, the Weather Channel reported.
