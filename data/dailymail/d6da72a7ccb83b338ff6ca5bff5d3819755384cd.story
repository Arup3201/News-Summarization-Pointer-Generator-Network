Andy Murray is hoping that some of Rory McIlroy’s recently-acquired magic dust can be sprinkled on him as he tries to mount a first successful run at a Grand Slam since Wimbledon last year.

After five days’ training ahead of the US Open, the 27-year-old Scot took time off on Friday to watch McIlroy in action in nearby New Jersey before spending the evening courtside at Madison Square Garden to see the USA basketball team play.

He also had dinner in Manhattan with McIlroy earlier this week, the two sportsmen having a strong understanding of what it is like to be each other.

‘It was fun. I have never been to watch golf live before,’ Murray said ‘So, you know, for a first experience, watching the best player in the world was pretty good.

‘I really enjoyed it. I guess it’s like pretty much any sport — when you watch them up close it’s impressive. Then in the evening, I went to the basketball, which I love watching. But this time to sit that close and see those guys. . . they’re huge guys, but just unbelievably quick, great athletes.It was a fun day for me.’

Murray may be an avid sports fan but that passion will probably not extend to watching his mother Judy in Strictly Come Dancing, after it was confirmed this week that she will take part in this winter’s competition. 

‘I mean, if it makes her happy, then I will support her,’ he smiled. ‘I’m not really into those shows, but she loves it. I mean, she watches it all the of the time, talks about it all the time. So, yeah, if she enjoys it, then I’m happy for her. I don’t believe I have ever seen her dance, to be honest. It will be interesting.’

The serious business starts tomorrow for the now No 8 seed, when he takes on Dutchman Robin Haase in the Louis Armstrong Stadium, where he has had plenty of difficult matches before.

Haase described his knee as being like that of a 60 or 70-year-old, but he can manage the condition. He expressed surprise that Murray has hired Amelie Mauresmo as coach, although not because she is a woman.

‘For me it’s a surprise that many tennis players work with ex-tennis players now . . . for example, I wouldn’t work with an ex-professional just because they have no experience as a coach.

‘When you are No 1, 2 or 3 in the world, you want to improve maybe those things you can only find in an ex-player so I totally understand, and if that’s a woman or a man, I think that doesn’t make a huge difference. I would have never done it, although that’s me.”

Murray has enjoyed her more consensual, attentive approach but his fellow former Wimbledon champion from last year, Marion Bartoli, is warning against people misinterpreting Mauresmo as some kind of soft touch.

‘She is not someone who is soft all the time, definitely not,’ said Bartoli — commentating for Sky this week — who has been coached herself by Mauresmo.

‘If something was wrong she was making her point strongly that it was wrong and that I or my team-mates needed to correct it. She is not a soft person, maybe she is making you feel comfortable but when you weren’t doing your best or I was having a lack of concentration she made sure I was back on track, really making a point of it.

‘I can only speak from my own experience but when I was with her at a Fed Cup tie or some time together at Wimbledon she’s very funny and can make a few jokes. It was an easy relationship and the flow was going extremely well, but then again when it was out on court it was all about concentration and making sure everyone was focused on the goal of winning the match.

‘There was a time for fun and a time for business and she was able to separate the two.’

Bartoli always expected Mauresmo to require ‘two to three months’ to settle in with Murray as she would need to learn about the men’s tour. ‘The men’s and women’s games are different but I do think people should be judged on their ability to do the job. For me it’s never been a problem of female or male in coaching, it’s more about your own capabilities.’

In the absence of Laura Robson, who is still recovering from her long-term wrist injury, Heather Watson will fly the British flag in the women’s singles in the company of Johanna Konta.

Watson, who plays Romania’s Sorana Cirstea, has improved this summer after last year’s bout of glandular fever, to the point where she is ranked 45 in the world.

The Briton — who recently beat the world No 12 Dominika Cibulkova of Slovakia — feels much happier about her prospects than she was 12 months ago. She said: ‘I was kind of dreading my match then because I came in with zero matches, but I’m a different player now, more aggressive and my confidence is up.
