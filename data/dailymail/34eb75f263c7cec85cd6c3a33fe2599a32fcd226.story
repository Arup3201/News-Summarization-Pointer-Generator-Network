The Maryland home of NFL veteran Ray Lewis has hit the market and all four bedrooms and baths—and the rest of the uniquely appointed pad—can be yours for a cool $1.1 million.

Lewis likely has no further need for the spacious house in the Baltimore area, having retired after the Ravens’ 2013 Super Bowl victory over San Francisco.

While the 38-year-old called his championship 17th season his ‘last ride,’ his realtor is quick to remind prospective buyers that the home in Owings Mills is where Lewis’s ‘first ride’ began.

Bargain: Recently retired Baltimore Ravens great Ray Lewis has put his Maryland home up for sale at $1.1 million

The realtor likely isn’t referring to Lewis’s other Super Bowl win back in 2000. The former NFL player became tied to an Atlanta double murder that occurred that night.

Richard Lollar and his friend Jacinth Baker were stabbed to death outside a nightclub on the night of January 31, 2000. While some evidence tied Lewis to the crime and he was initially charged with double homicide, he cut a deal with prosecutors and got off in exchange for his testimony about two friends he was with that night.

Good times: The 17-year veteran helped take his team to the Super Bowl twice before retiring in 2013

Trophy room: A hallway features some of the two-time Super Bowl champ's football memorabilia--though it's likely not included in the offering price

Retired: Lewis won his second Super Bowl in 2013, thirteen years after his first win in 2000 on a night that would become infamous for the linebacker

In addition to its former occupant, future owners of the home will have many reasons to boast about their abode. At least 52 reasons if you ask Keller Williams realtor Nicole Nichols.

Built in 1995, the brick home features ‘lavish appointments of marble and granite,’ reads the listing. This includes the pristine granite countertops in the home’s sprawling, 1950s diner inspired kitchen.

Cozy: The Owings Mills, Maryland home has four bedrooms and four baths

Modern: Posh bathrooms, one of which features a steam shower, adjoin the grand master suites

Squeaky clean: A contemporary, black tiled steam showers is helpful for potential buyers who often need to clean off championship ticker tape

Fun home: Humor abounds in the home, as seen in this kids bathroom that almost channels Pee Wee's Playhouse

Some of that fine stone can also be found in the bathrooms off the grand master suites, one of which features a contemporary steam shower lined with attractive glass blocks.

One of the bathrooms channels Pee Wee’s Playhouse with tile and trim in a vivid fire engine red.

The suites themselves are custom-designed in warm, welcoming safari hues and even more warmth can be had from the home’s two fireplaces.

To die for: Like any self-respecting baller, Lewis keeps a walk-in closet that many a shoe lover would kill for

Classic: Clearly an oak man, Lewis's home abounds with the fine wood

Another persuasive reason to buy Lewis’s home: an Olympic-sized swimming pool in the back below a gorgeous first-floor promenade-style deck.

Drying off is also a breeze because steps away from the pool is a cozy built-in sauna.

For those more interested in cuddling up indoors, the den offers a high-tech entertainment system.

Livelier: This den shows a brighter side to Lewis and offers plenty of trophy space to more athletic prospective buyers

Kitschy: A gourmet kitchen has a 1950s diner feel

And true to a baller’s form, Lewis’s home features a walk-in closet that any shoe-loving apartment dweller would kill for.

The Baltimore home is one of two that Lewis is offering up for sale.

He also has a Palm Beach home in his native Florida for sale. That 12,000 square foot mansion is listed at just under $5 million.
