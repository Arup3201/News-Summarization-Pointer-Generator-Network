Air pollution from oil and gas wells in Utah is being linked to the deaths of 13 infants last year - a rate six times higher than the national average.

But the midwife who raised the alarm about the possible link has been targeted by threats and vandalism because drilling has helped the area in question prosper and kept thousands of people employed since the 1940s.  

The city of Vernal has 12,000 oil and gas wells, and some scientists whose research focuses on the effect of certain drilling-related chemicals on fetal development believe it could be the reason for the spike in infant deaths.

Thirteen babies died near the Unitah Basin in Vernal last year, something some scientists are suggesting could be linked to oil and gas drilling in the area 'have blinders on'

Midwife Donna Young uncovered an upward four-year trend in infant deaths in the Uintah Basin, in northeast Utah.

One in every 95.5 burials in Uintah County in 2010 was a baby, which increased to one in every 53 burials the following year. In 2012, the figure increased again to one burial in every 39.7 and last year it jumped to one in every 15.

Heather Jensen, whose two infants sons, died in late 2011 and 2013, told The Denver Post: 'People like to blame stuff on that all the time, but I don't feel like it has anything to do with oil and gas. I just feel like it's a trial I was given,'

In neighboring Colorado late last year, an unusually high number of fetal anomalies in Glenwood Springs, 175 miles away in Colorado, were reported to state authorities. Drilling was investigated as a possible cause, but the study found no connection.

Concerns have also been raised in other areas of heavy drilling, but no spikes in deaths have been recorded and no conclusions have been reached. 

Susan Nagel, a University of Missouri School of Medicine researcher who is focusing her studies on fracking-fluid chemicals that affect hormones said she suspects there is a 'relationship' between drilling and the deaths in Utah. 

Medical studies have found that air pollution can harm embryos. Harmful chemicals like benzene, toluene and xylenes are released during drilling, and can cross the placental barrier and cause heart, brain and spinal defects.

 Dr Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment said those not considering the link between air pollution and the deaths had their '

Dr Brian Moench, president of the Utah Physicians for a Healthy Environment, said establishing a conclusive link between drilling and baby deaths is complicated, but of the Vernal-area deaths, he said 'air pollution from drilling is a part of it'. 

Air pollution is often a combination of chemicals and particles, combined from multiple sources.

In Vernal, diesel pickups and fracking rigs are commonplace, and spew out fumes; coal-fired plants sends plumes of smoke into the air, and oil field-support businesses, stretch for miles. 

A study by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric administration recently showed dangerously high levels of ozone in the Uintah Basin around Vernal. And last winter the levels were recorded as being well beyond those set by the Environmental Protection Agency.   

The study pointed at the oil and gas industry.'I think we pretty clearly have an air-quality problem, but we try not to freak out,' said Seth Lyman, an air-quality researcher with Utah State University in Vernal. 

'But I think there is a low probability (that) air quality is bad enough to impact infant mortality.'

'I think we pretty clearly have an air-quality problem, but we try not to freak out,' said Seth Lyman, an air-quality researcher with Utah State University in Vernal

Another factor being considered as possibly contributing to the deaths is an explosion east of Vernal in March, 2013 at a business that cleans fracking equipment, which sent debris over a half-mile area.

Authorities in Vernal discounted the explosion as having any environmental impact. They've said those complaining about air quality in Vernal don't live there. 

The possible link was given some credence when the TriCounty Health Department decided to help with a study to investigate the baby death spike. Ms Young had taken her findings, compiled through obituaries, to Dr Moench.

Epidemiologists are using birth and death certificates to test Ms Young's findings. The results are expected early next year.

Pollution aside, the Uintah County isn't a healthy place. It ranks 24th of 27 Utah counties in health rankings, smoking rates are twice what they are in the rest of Utah, obesity is also an issue, as is heavy drinking. There are also a high number of teen mothers. 

Dr Moench said those not considering the connection 'have blinders on'. 

Ms Nagal has gathered samples in Colorado's Garfield County and is exposing pregnant mice to fracking fluids to investigate what if any impact they have on their offspring. 

Earlier research she showed babies born to mothers living within 10 miles of wells are at greater risk of congenital heart defects and neural tube defects.But other researches have discredits her research methods. 

Ms Young, who delivers a lot of babies for father's who work in the oil fields, now insists that all her pregnant patients use air and water filters. 

The study in Garfield County, was also sparked by concerns raise by midwives. The study looked at 22 cases and found no direct links to air pollution.

A recent survey of Vernal residents indicated 85 per cent welcomed oil shale development, which is expected to get underway next year. 

More than 25,000 new oil and gas wells are proposed in the basin.
