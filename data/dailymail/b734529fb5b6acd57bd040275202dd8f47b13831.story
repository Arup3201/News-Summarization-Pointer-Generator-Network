The parents accused of murdering their six children in a house fire will not be attending their funerals, it was announced today.

Mick, 55 and Mairead Philpott, 31, are currently in custody and face six counts of murder following the fire at their home in Allenton, Derby, on May 11.

Philpott, said to have fathered 17 children, and his wife are thought to have applied to authorities for compassionate leave to attend the children’s funerals.

Grief: Mick and Mairead Philpott cried at a news 
conference about the fire, which killed six of their children

Service: The funerals will take at the family's local church, St Mary's, in Derby on June 22, followed by a burial at Nottingham Road cemetery in the Chaddesden area of the city

The funerals will take at the family’s 
local church, St Mary’s, in Derby on June 22, followed by a burial at 
Nottingham Road cemetery in the Chaddesden area of the city.

With feelings running high in the area, police and the prison authorities would have had to assess whether the Philpotts would be safe attending the ceremony.

Duwayne Philpott, 13, his sister Jade, 10, and brothers John, nine, Jack, seven, Jessie, six and Jayden, five, all died as a result of the blaze, which broke out in the early hours of May 11.

Their parents were charged with murder 19 days later, are currently remanded in custody awaiting an appearance at Nottingham Crown Court on Monday.

Their priest, Father Alan Burbidge, who will conduct the service, said Mr and Mrs Philpott  would not be present.

He added: 'We have had confirmation this morning that the parents of the six children will not be attending the funeral which will take place at St Mary’s Catholic Church at 11am on June 22.

'The family have chosen that church as a venue because they are Catholic children and they wanted a full requiem mass in a Catholic church.'

The couple originally wanted to hold the funeral at Derby Cathedral because of the 
amount of people it was thought would want to attend.

Earlier
this month a Prison Service spokesman explained to The People that a 
full assessment would be undertaken involving police and other 
agencies.

'It is a unique situation and we cannot think, right now, of 
any other defendants in the past who have been charged with murdering 
their children, then wanting to attend their funerals.That is why it 
poses such a huge risk.'

The spokesperson said that public protection was key and if the risk is too high a private memorial may be arranged.

Respect: Well-wishers have left hundreds of cards, flowers, teddy bears and candles after a candlelit vigil

The People reported Mr Philpott's son
Richard, 25, told a friend: 'They want to be at the funerals and need 
to be able to say goodbye. Whatever has happened, they are innocent 
until proven guilty. The public should not judge them. Let a jury do 
that when they know all the facts.

Before their arrests, the Philpotts 
had started planning the funerals and had arranged for six separate 
double-horse-drawn hearses to carry the coffins at Derby Cathedral.

The costs of the funeral service will 
be met by DJ’s Trust - the D standing for Duwayne and the J for the five
other children - which was set up following the blaze.

Organiser Anthony Slater said: 'We 
have just over £14,000 in the fund at the moment which will pay for the 
burial costs and the headstones. I have spoken to the family and they 
still plan for the children to be brought to the service and taken to 
the cemetery via horse-drawn hearses.

'In terms of money, I think we have hit what we need to hit to cover the funeral costs.'

The news comes after the coroner’s office in Derby released the bodies from the mortuary at the Royal Derby Hospital on Tuesday.

The six children were asleep upstairs when the fire broke out at the semi-detached house in Victory Road in the early hours of May 11.

Derbyshire Police have confirmed that petrol was used to start the blaze.

Smoke from the fire travelled upstairs to where the children were in bed.

All six died as a result of smoke inhalation, the force has said.

An inquest into their deaths was opened and adjourned at Derby Coroner’s Court last month by Coroner Dr Robert Hunter.

The hearing was told that John, Jack, Jesse, Jayden and Jade were all certified dead at the accident and emergency department of the Royal Derby Hospital.

Duwayne died of his injuries in Birmingham Children’s Hospital two days later.

No causes of death were given during the inquest.

Assistant Chief Constable Steve Cotterill is leading the murder investigation.

He said: 'Our police investigations are ongoing and we are preparing a file for the Crown Prosecution Service.'

The Prison Service has not confirmed if the Philpotts applied for leave, but said a risk assessment would be carried out as is standard practice if an application has been made.

A spokeswoman said: 'We do not comment on the movements of individual prisoners.

'Prisoners can apply for escorted visits to attend the funeral of a close relative, but it will always be subject to a strict risk assessment where public protection is key.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
