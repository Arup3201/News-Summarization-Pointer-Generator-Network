Cleveland house of horrors kidnap victim Michelle Knight revealed Sunday that she not only forgives her brutal captor Ariel Castro, but she also doesn't blame him for the perverse horrors he subjected her to for 11 years.  

'At first I hated him,' Knight told the group at Notre Dame-Cathedral Latin High School. 'But I went through therapy and realized it hadn't been his fault. He had a disease.'

The shocking revelation came as Knight, 33, addressed a live audience for the first time ever in Chardon, Ohio.

Forgives her captor: Speaking to a live audience for the first time in Chardon, Ohio, Knight, 33 (seen here at the event), described how therapy led finally allowed her to say Ariel Castro's name aloud and how that moment finally let forgive a man so many labeled a monster

'It wasn't his fault': Knight shocked some when she said that she blames Catro's sexual addiction and not him as a man for the decade of torture she endured

While Knight has changed her own name, preferring to go by Lily now, she's now able to refer to Castro where for so long he was single 'that dude.'

'I was able to say his name, Ariel Castro...I was able to forgive him,' she said, according to Cleveland.com.

Knight said that Castro spoke to her of his 'sexual addiction' when he first abducted her. He told her at the time that he only intended to keep her for a little while.

'I knew he was lying, but what could I do,' she said.

'I am a sex addict,' Knight recalled Castro saying. 'I cannot control myself.'

She now blames that addiction, and not the man himself, for her decade of disgusting abuse. She even offered the audience of 300 some advice:

Finding her faith: Knight told the crowd of 300 that her faith in God has helped her move on following her 11 years in captivity as well as to forgive Ariel Castro

Knight also discussed her hobbies, which include cooking, drawing, singing and reading. She said she loves to read all of Stephen King's novels

'If you're getting abused...don't wait, get help.'

Knight also discussed her hobbies, which include cooking, drawing, singing and reading. She said she loves to read all of Stephen King's novels.

'That might be a little weird right now,' she said after a moment of reflection.

Knight was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002. Amanda Berry was abducted in April 2003 just a day shy of her 17th birthday, and Gina DeJesus was 14 when he kidnapped her a year later.

The women escaped from Castro's home on May 6, 2013. 

Castro took a plea deal to avoid a potential death sentence and received life in prison plus 1,000 years. Knight said he violently aborted five of her pregnancies by kicking, punching and stomping on her abdomen after impregnating her. 

He ended up hanging himself in his prison cell a month after sentencing.

Forgiven? While Knight has changed her own name, preferring to go by Lily now, she's now able to refer to Castro where for so long he was single 'that dude'

Fellow prisoners: Knight was 21 when Castro lured her to his home in August 2002. Amanda Berry (left) was abducted in April 2003 just a day shy of her 17th birthday, and Gina DeJesus (right) was 14 when he kidnapped her a year later

While Berry and DeJesus were reunited with loving families who had prayed that they would someday return, Knight refused to meet her mother who had flown to Cleveland from Florida. 

Berry and DeJesus have kept a lower profile than Knight in the time since their escape. The pair are, like Knight, slated to release a book detailing their saga.

However, their public appearances have been far fewer than Knight's. The pair made an appearance in Washington in May, where they were given a special White House reception by President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden.

Knight spent the first four months of her freedom in an assisted living facility because she had nowhere else to go.

Knight said her 3,911 days in captivity have helped instill in her a deep appreciation for what's good in the world.
