The most controversial participant on thought-provoking TV show First Contact failed to show up to SBS's live discussion about the documentary on Thursday night.

Newcastle woman Sandy Clifford, who made no secret of her views about Aboriginal people and said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist, neglected to appear in the live round-up despite being touted in adverts for it.

It comes after she lied to producers about getting her nails done and escaped on a flight back to Sydney halfway through filming the series.

Host Stan Grant did not explain where she was but simply said: ‘Sandy couldn't be here tonight.’

Mortgage broker Sandy walked off SBS TV show First Contact halfway through filming

The 41-year-old lied to producers about getting her nails done before escaping on a flight back to Sydney

During the show Sandy said: ‘God gave black people rhythm and soul. They can dance and sing and are hot while they dance, but when it comes to brains, white people have a better gene, better make up.' 

SBS had promised: ‘After a journey of conflict and discovery, Sandy, Trent, Alice, Jasmine, Marcus and Bo-dene will be reunited and joined by Indigenous people they met and a studio audience.’

The 41-year-old dramatically quit the SBS documentary series, which took six Australians to meet Aboriginal communities around the country, on day 13 of a 28-day shoot while filming in Alice Springs.

The show's producer Darren Dale, from Blackfella Films, told Daily Mail Australia: 'She said she was going to get her nails done.’ 

'Then when she hadn't come back, when we couldn't find her our instinct was she's flown to Sydney.

'With the timing it was 10.30am and a plane left at 11.30am, we had a pretty good hunch she got a plane.'

Mr Dale said they sent one of their crew members based in Sydney to the airport who found her walking off the plane.

Mr Dale also revealed that the mother of five is of Syrian, German and Caucasian descent and the father of her children is Maori.

Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children

Some viewers on social media remarked that it was odd she held such strong views about Indigenous Australians when she had mixed race children, but Mr Dale said he believed Sandy was just unapologetically set in her beliefs.

'Sandy is like a force of nature, I think she's got such a wilful personality and I think her views transcend everything,' he said.

'She clearly thinks what she thinks, she doesn't care about race, religion, creed.'

Sandy told news.com.au she left the show because she'd had enough of the experiences and because tensions were flaring with fellow participant Alice.

'I’m thinking, "For f*** sake, are you for real? I’m not putting up with this s*** for the next 18 days. I’ve got enough drama at home",' she said.

Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at an Aboriginal family's house in Sydney, she said: 'I'm not staying here, I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses.'

'I had a lot of stuff going on at home as well, with a divorce, and my children back here in Newcastle.' 

It has also emerged that she no longer works as a mortgage broker in Newcastle.

A spokeswoman for her former employer, financial planning firm Chase Edwards, said Sandy was 'no longer with us', despite the fact her LinkedIn profile listed her as being currently employed there.

‘Sandy’s not worked at Chase Edwards for approximately six months and she’s not associated with the company in any way,’ she said.

The TV show filmed in April this year.

The most controversial of the show's participants said she didn’t ‘f***ing care’ if people thought she was racist

'If you're out there and you're looking at f***ing kangaroos go past and snakes and build a fire, like f***, how much more can you learn?,' Sandy said on screen. 

Faced with sleeping in a child’s bed at a house in Sydney, the mother-of-five pulled no punches.

‘F***, I’m not staying’, she said. ‘I can’t. I know what happens on those mattresses.

They’re all sleeping on it with their sweat, their drinking and their partying, all their boozing and all their yahooing and I ain't sleeping on it. It's dirty.’

Sandy, described on the show as a mother of five mixed race children, also initially claimed that Aboriginals had ‘whinged too much’ about the stolen generation of children snatched from their parents to be brought up in white society.

However, after hearing first hand from a family affected by the policy, she softened her views.

The group of six responded in dramatically different ways to their experience, with some embracing Aboriginal culture and others struggling to come to terms with what they saw.

After starting out in Sydney, the group travelled to Nyinyikay, in the Northern Territory, where the men took part in a turtle hunt.

The slaughter of the creature took place the next day and was deeply divisive with some of the women openly crying.

On episode two, to air on Wednesday night, the group visit remote community Elcho Island, off Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. 

Sandy pulled out of the show shortly afterwards.

Jasmine says that months after filming she feels like some of her questions went unanswered, and she still believes it is unfair Aborigines get higher welfare payments and placements in university

Similar to the acclaimed Go Back To Where You Came From, the show takes six 'ordinary' Australians and immerses them in Aboriginal communities to try to challenge their prejudices about the Indigenous population.

'Petrol sniffing', 'wasters' and 'spending their dole cheques on booze' are among the labels the six people give to Aborigines at first.

Host Ray Martin said none of the opinions he heard on the show shocked him, as he had heard them many times before.

The veteran journalist and passionate advocate for Aboriginal issues said six out of 10 Australians have never met or have little to do with an Indigenous person.

'The Aboriginal problem is a festering sore of Australian society, it's one of those things we have to fix,' Mr Martin said.

'So we thought we would take six people - average Aussies who weren't racists, or weirdos or nutters – and have people willing to ask questions and willing to question their beliefs.

'Why do they drink so much, why don't they send their kids to school, why don't they leave townships and get a job? They are all valid questions and not racist questions.'

The second episode of First Contact is at 8.30pm on Wednesday 19 November. It concludes at 8.30pm on Thursday 20 November – broadcast simultaneously each night on SBS ONE and NITV, and replayed at 9.30pm on SBS 2
