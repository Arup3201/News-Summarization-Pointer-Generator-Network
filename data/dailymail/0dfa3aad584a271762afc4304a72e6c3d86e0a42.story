Horrified commuters have spoken of the terrible moment a 12-year-old girl was left fighting for her life after being hit by tube train during yesterday's morning rush hour.

Eyewitnesses described how the the girl 'screamed with pain' as she 
lay trapped underneath the train at Brixton tube station in front of helpless commuters at 8.40am yesterday morning.

One commuter told how the scene descended into chaos as shocked witnesses fled the station in tears after witnessing the incident.

Eyewitness James McDonnell, 41, said: 'The station was really packed on the platform, it was absolutely rammed with people.

'I saw three or four young women 
running towards me crying with their hands over their mouths, they were 
saying "Somebody has been hit, somebody has been hit".

'One woman was saying "Oh my God, I heard somebody scream. She has been hit by a train, she has been hit by a train".

'I didn't know at the time what had 
happened and I didn't see the girl myself, but by everyone's reactions I
could tell that something pretty awful had happened.'

The account manager from Brixton said
the aftermath descended into 'chaos' as traumatised commuters were quickly ushered
out of the station because there were not enough staff members to check
on them.

He said: 'There was absolute chaos when those people ran out. There was just an 
announcement over the PA system and the station was so busy that it was 
chaos getting out.

'One woman ran out and her face was 
streaming with tears, she was pale and shaking. I remember thinking that
she should probably talk to somebody because she was in such a state of
shock.

'But there was only one member of 
staff I could see so I couldn't direct her to anyone. I did think it was
strange that there weren't more members of staff around to talk to the 
commuters who had witnessed such a serious accident.

London Ambulance Service attended the incident and rushed the girl to hospital. She is believed to have 'life threatening injuries'

'Incidents
like this must happen a fair amount and the thing that stood out was 
that there wasn't any member of staff for the people who were upset and 
had seen the incident to turn to.'

The 12-year-old girl was struck by the Victoria 
Line train at around 8.40am at Brixton station in South London, the last
stop on the busy underground line.

One member of station staff, who was working at the time, said he heard the girl’s wails as she lay trapped on the track unable to move.

The man, who wished to remain 
anonymous, said: ‘I came onto the platform and I could hear the sound of
a girl screaming coming from under the train.

‘I couldn’t see her – she was under the train. She was screaming and crying – it sounded like she was in a lot of pain.

‘There
were a lot of people standing around - it was a busy time. People were 
panicking and no-one could go down on the track to help because of the 
electricity. People were trying to reassure the girl from the platform.

'Someone radioed up to the station 
supervisor to turn off the electricity. A special response team came 
down to the platform and then we all got moved upstairs.'

A local man described on a neighbourhood blog how he had gone to church to pray for the girl after seeing the incident.

Posting as Nick, he said: 'This is the most horrific 
thing I have ever seen.

'I'm still completely in shock, I was shaking for an hour. I cannot remove it from my head. I see and hear it again and again.

'I left work earlier, I feel physically sick, I was terrified on my way back in the tube, and worst when I arrived to Brixton.

'I've been to church, thing I never do normally, to pray for her, and also for this poor train driver.'

There was speculation that the girl was trying to reach down to the tracks to retrieve something she had dropped.

However,
a police source said: ‘As far as we are aware, this wasn’t connected to
a phone dropped onto the tracks or anything else.

‘We do not believe she was trying to reach down onto the platform.’

Shocked commuters have tweeted their horror at the incident.

Angela Wolff, who was in the station at the time told of hearing a ‘bang and screams’.

She
said: ‘Still feel like I’m in shock and I didn’t even see anything. 
Just heard the bang and screams and a sea of shocked pale faces.’

The
incident was reported to British Transport Police (BTP) who attended 
the scene along with Metropolitan Police Officers and paramedics.

A BTP spokesman said the incident ‘is currently being treated as non-suspicious’

They added: 'The girl is in a serious critical condition in hospital. She has been assessed by the doctors at Kings College Hospital and her family are by her bedside.

'We are not at the current time divulging details of the injuries she has sustained.'
