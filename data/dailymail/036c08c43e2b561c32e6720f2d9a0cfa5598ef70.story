A grandmother whose life-long struggle with her weight left her desperate, isolated and on the brink of suicide has managed to turn her life around. 

Tracie Riley, 49, from Failsworth, lost an incredible 13st in less than a year after hitting rock bottom, and now says her only regret is that her father, whom she cared for for years, never got to see her transform her life.

Tracie has gone from a  size 30 who wore a 50E bra to a  size 10 after dropping from 24st to 11st, losing more than a stone a month by following the unusual Alizonne diet at a clinic in Wilmslow.

Tracie dropped from size 30 and 24st (left) to 11st and a size 10 (right) by adopting a radical meal replacement program and then slowly re-introducing healthy food

The diet uses protein-based meal replacements before phasing normal food back in and is combined with skin-tightening treatments so that clients, who lose weight rapidly, are not left looking saggy.

Tracie said: 'I had got to the stage where I was repulsed by myself. I was desperate, I would have cut my legs off to lose weight.

Tracie's size (left) impacted her self esteem so dramatically that she would barely leave the house but now she feels she has a new lease on life (right) 

'It destroyed my life. I never looked at myself in the mirror and I would never weigh myself. I didn't realise how heavy I was.

Tracie gave up work to care for her seriously ill father

'In the end it made me suicidal. I got to the point where I thought I can't go on. It really was do or die. Thank God, I decided I want to live.'

The mother-of-two worked at Hubron plastic manufacturers in Failsworth as a forklift truck driver before giving up in 2002, to care for her seriously ill father. 

She used her life savings to pay for the diet, which has cost her £7,000, but says it was worth every penny.

Tracie, a grandmother-of-two, said: 'I found it easy, I wasn't hungry and I never gained weight once - the first week I lost 12lb.'

She began her diet last November and was so committed that even her Christmas dinner was a 100 calorie shake.

She said: 'I cooked turkey and all the trimmings for the family but I had a vanilla shake made from powder and water. This year I plan to be eating turkey though.'

Tracie's weight problems began as a child. She added: 'I was always chubby. It really got out of hand after my second child Lindsey was born. I tried everything, I even did the cabbage soup diet for six months.

'It had got to the stage where I was afraid of food. I ruined my metabolism by trying to starve myself. I never sat down to eat a proper meal, I just snacked constantly, drank coffee and smoked.

'My only regret is that my dad Bob didn't live to see me like this, but the rest of my family are thrilled and I'm happier and healthier than I have ever been.'

People following the diet are given five portions of 'food' a day, each containing 108 calories.

Some are sachets that can be made into drinks, others are food like protein bars.

Dieters also have to take six different supplements each day and drink plenty of water. 

Once a week you visit the clinic to be weighed and have a blood test and blood pressure test.

Every four weeks you are seen by a doctor for a check up.

Tracey, who has been married for 13 years, says she was always chubby as a child and by the time she was 16 she weighed 13st.

She had a very loving home, but her would was turned upside down when her father, Bob, a policeman, had a brain haemorrhage when she was six.

He was bed bound for 42 years until his death a year ago.

'When I was six my dad fell ill. He had a brain haemorrhage and he couldn't speak or walk after that.

'He had 14 to 15 epileptic fits a day. I was brought up with a lot of sickness but I felt very loved. My dad was my hero.

'My dad travelled all over the world with the navy, but he could never tell me the stories about his life because he couldn't speak. 

'He had bowel cancers and gall bladder cancer when he died. He had been in bed for 42 years.

'Me and my mum, Sheila, never begrudged looking after him. He was my hero without a doubt.'

In the years afterwards being so heavy began to  whittle away at Tracie's confidence. 

Tracie now says her only regret is that her father, whom she cared for for years, never got to see her transform her life

'I would wear baggy tops. I was disgusted with myself. I would just cover what part of my body I could. I had to cover myself up so I couldn't see it never mind other people.

'I would always wear black clothes, a black top and black pants. At the end I only had one set of clothes that would fit me so I had to wash them every night and dry them overnight.

British Dietetic Association spokesperson, Aisling Pigott says:  'At a quick glance, Allizone therapy is an expensive low calorie meal replacement diet which claims to offer structured support to return to normal and healthy eating. 

'Many people find this a useful method of tackling the very difficult task of losing weight. With the right support and attitude, this can be an appropriate weight loss method for some individuals. However, as with any weight management interventions, short term weight loss does not indicate success and long term weight maintenance is the most important and difficult goal.

'I do have concerns about the ethics of the advertising and wording used on this companies websites. Alizonne Therapy makes specific scientific claims such as 'stabilising blood glucose' and 'breakdown of stored body fat', however these are common principles of any healthy eating advice and evidence based weight loss programmes. Unfortunately, I was unable to locate any scientific evidence to support this. Without further information, I would certainly not recommend Allizone Therapy as superior to any other calorie restrictive diets with support to return to normal eating.

'In summary, some people may find this type of treatment useful, however obesity and weight loss is a complex and individual disease. There is no 'one size fits all' approach to weight loss and companies need to be careful they are not exploiting vulnerable clients looking for a 'quick fix' with expensive and treatments which are not maintainable.'

'Any clothes I did buy I would buy online. I was too embarrassed to go into a shop. that was part of the problem. It doesn't worry some people who are overweight to go out in public.

'But I am a shy and reserved person anyway. When you are overweight that makes it even worse. I couldn't be seen in public.

'People do look at you if you are fat and they can't help but judge you.  When someone says it doesn't bother them I think they they are lying. It must bother you.

'You would prefer to be slim.

'I just stopped going out completely.

'If there was a family meal or celebration I never used to go. It might sound funny but I was never a really big eater.

'I had been on so many yo yo diets that it was destroying my insides.'

'I didn't know which way to turn or how to get rid of this weight. I used to wake up in this morning and I felt as if i was carrying a big boulder on my back. 

'I had to care for my dad. In the evenings I would just lie on the sofa and watch TV. And then I couldn't get up I was that big.

'So a few weeks before my dad passed away I decided to go to this clinic and make this appointment.

'They were so good. A year before I would never had the courage to even go there because of how I looked. But I had reached rock bottom and I just stopped caring.

'I was at the lowest ebb. They were brilliant at the clinic. I wish this was was available on the NHS. The success rate would be astronomical, but the NHS can't fund something so expensive.

'This treatment has saved my life in one way. If I had carried on the way I was going my heart would have packed in because of the strain. I could have died before I even had the treatment I was that big.
