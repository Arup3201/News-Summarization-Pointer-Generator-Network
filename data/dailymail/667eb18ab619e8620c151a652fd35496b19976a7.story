The suit worn by Gene Kelly in the classic musical ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ has been sold for £65,000.

The garment was bought by Robert Earl, the founder of restaurant chain Planet Hollywood, who had been after it since it resurfaced earlier this year.

The piece of Hollywood history has come at a price though and, like the film, it has aged well with time.

Worth Singin' in the Rain for: The water-stained gray woolen suit worn by Gene Kelly in Singin' In The Rain sold for £65,000

Star suit: The Hollywood superstar wore the belted two piece suit when he famously splashed through puddles while singing the title song in the 1952 movie

The suit was last sold to memorabilia 
collector Gerald Sola for just for £6.50 in 1970 when MGM Studios, which
 made Singin’ in the Rain in 1952, was having a cleanout.

Sola now stands to make a 10,000 per cent profit on his investment.

Kelly made the belted two piece gray woolen suit famous after dancing joyously in it during a downpour in Singin’ in the Rain.

And 60 years on the jacket still bears
 the marks of filming - the inside of it is covered in water stains from
 where Kelly was repeatedly drenched during takes.

The
 garment was made specially for 5ft 7 actor by Oscar-winning costume 
designer Walter Plunkett, who also designed the clothes in Gone With The
 Wind.

Plunkett had a then-enormous costume budget for the film of $157,000 (£96,000) to create the period 1920s designs.

Hollywood
 legend has it that the wool suit shrank during the three days of 
filming leaving the inside label stained even to this day - Kelly’s name
 is still smudged.

The suit 
had been expected to go for around £12,000, meaning that the final price
 was three times the estimate, said Dallas-based auctioneers Heritage 
Auctions.

In an interview before the sale Sola, a retired postal worker, said that when he first saw the suit he was stunned.

He said: ‘I noticed right away that there were water stains in the jacket. I knew right away what it was from so I bought it.’

Earl
 said he plans to put the suit on display in one of his Planet Hollywood
 restaurants, though he had not yet decided which one.

Singin’
 in the Rain follows Kelly’s character, actor Don Lockwood, in his 
attempts to move from silent films into ‘talkies’ before venturing into 
musicals.

Margaret Barrett, from Heritage Auctions,
 said: 'Singin’ in the Rain is one of the best and most loved musical 
movies ever made and this suit comes from its most famous scene.

Legend has it: The suit is water stained from when Kelly was drenched repeatedly during filming and Hollywood legend has it that it also shrunk during the three days of filming

'Incredibly the current owner picked it up from the famous MGM costume sale in 1970 for just $10 (£6.50).

'All the costumes were hanging on racks and as he was searching through them he noticed Gene Kelly’s nametag on the inside.

'Then he saw the inner lining was water stained and realised it had to be the jacket from Singin’ in the Rain.

'Also on the rack was another of Gene’s suits from the film which he had to pay $75 for.

'They now look like they’re going to have been a very good investment.'

Also on sale: This beige and navy outfit which was also worn by Kelly in the film was also being sold for $6,500 at auction

As well as starring in Singin’ in the Rain, Gene Kelly also choreographed and directed it.

The film was conceived as promotional vehicle for songs written by MGM’s Arthur Freed in the 1920s and 30s.

The theme song Singin’ in the Rain was first performed by Doris Eaton Travis in The Hollywood Music Box Revue in 1929.

It then appeared in the 1929 musical The Hollywood Revue, on Annette Hanshaw’s album Volume 6, in the 1932 film Speak Easy and by Judy Garland in Little Nellie Kelly in 1940.

Since Singin’ in the Rain it has been used in numerous films including Alfred Hitchcock’s North by Northwest in 1959 and A Clockwork Orange in 1971.

It was also the subject of one of Morecambe and Wise’s most famous sketches.
