In a picture that looks like it could have been lifted from a family photo album, mother Sally Jones and her partner cradle her new-born son.

But ten years later the mother-of-two fled from Britain to Syria to join bloodthirsty ISIS militants.

The new image shows Muslim convert Jones, 45 - who spent a lifetime on benefits - looking lovingly into the camera as she holds her baby boy, just hours after he was born on December 19, 2004.

The new image shows Muslim convert Sally Jones, 45, looking lovingly into the camera as she holds her baby boy with her former partner, just hours after the baby was born on December 19, 2004

A picture posted on Twitter appeared to show mother-of-two Jones wielding an AK-47 assault rifle

She is seen sitting next to former partner, believed to be the baby's father, as she tenderly clasps her bundle of joy at Medway Hospital in Kent.

Three thousand miles away Sunni militants had just claimed responsibility for killing 22 people during the bombing of a US-base in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

The troubles of the Middle East must have felt a world away from this touching family moment.

Yet ten years on this Jones, who now calls herself Sakinah Hussain, is part of jihadist group ISIS - and is believed to have taken her son with her.

Jones is thought to have sneaked into Syria at the end of last year after an online romance with Junaid Hussain, a 20-year-old hacker turned militant from Birmingham, and is believed to live in the city of Raqqa.

Last month she ranted on Twitter about how she wanted to behead Christians with a 'blunt knife', and revealed that she had married  Hussain because Britain and America were 'terrorist' nations.

She has posted a series of chilling threats on social networking sites and posed for photos wielding an AK-47 assault rifle while dressed in black with her face veiled. 

She warned on Twitter: ‘You Christians all need beheading with a nice blunt knife and stuck on the railings at Raqqa... Come here I’ll do it for you!’ 

Almost 10 years on, she now calls herself Sakinah Hussain, and is part of evil jihadist group ISIS

Jones has renamed her youngest son and taken him from Chatham, Kent, to Raqqa, Syria

She has renamed her youngest son, but her eldest son, now 18, has decided to remain in the UK.

The militant claims her husband Junaid and friend Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary were not involved in the beheading of American journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff.

She added that her online threat to behead Christians was just a response to online abuse.

Jones is an unlikely Islamic convert and even more unlikely member of the terrorist militia. In the early 1990s she was the lead guitarist in an all-girl rock band called Krunch who played a series of gigs in the South East.

A clip of one of her performances posted online shows her with a shock of blonde hair and wearing a leather mini-skirt. In recent years she developed an interest in art, attempting to sell fantasy pictures as well as T-shirts, mugs and key rings through a niche website. 

She adopted several online personas such as Skya and Catgel, and contributed to forums on conspiracy theories, witchcraft and black magic.

Jones claims to have married Junaid Hussain, a computer hacker from Birmingham who has also joined ISIS militants in Syria

One bizarre picture showed her dressed as a nun while pointing a large handgun.

She later forged an online romance with Hussain, who was the leader of a computer hacking group known as Team Poison.

Last month her brother Patrick, 52, who runs his own paving company, said his family were deeply shocked by her conversion to radical Islam.

Speaking at his £500,000 home in Oxted, Surrey, he said: ‘This is a very upsetting and distressing time for my family and I just don’t want them to be a part of it. She fell in love and went away.’ 

Earlier this month, David Cameron unveiled controversial new plans to crack down on jihadists bringing bloodshed to Britain’s streets.

He vowed to introduce measures to bar home-grown fanatics fighting in the Middle East from re-entering the UK, either by stripping them of their passports or stopping them boarding flights back home.

It has been reported that as many as 30 British jihadis are looking at ways of returning to the UK after losing faith with the brutal cause, but fear being imprisoned.
