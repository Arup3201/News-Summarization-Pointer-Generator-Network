Manny Pacquiao's concerns over 'feeling slow' appear unfounded after the boxer showed some exceptional hand speed during a training session ahead of his $300million (£200m) mega fight with Floyd Mayweather Jnr on May 2.

The Filipino posted the latest video of his preparations from the world famous Wild Card Boxing Club in Los Angeles, accompanied by the caption: 'Day 5 of my work out at the gym, thank you Lord.'.

The 36-year-old had previously claimed: ‘I feel slow but I’m not worried because I still have a lot of time.’ But he seemed up to speed as he worked his way through a pair of speed balls before finishing with a flurry of shadow boxing punches.

The Hollywood gym, which is run by the Pacquiao’s esteemed trainer Freddie Roach, is usually open to fans but has had to employ seven armed guards ahead of the most eagerly anticipated fight in boxing history.

Roach, who is currently in Macau preparing for for Zou Shimming’s first world title fight on Saturday, said he insisted on the guards having guns so that ‘people respect them’.

The renowned trainer will return to LA to meet with Mayweather and his team on Wednesday - the last time the pair will come face-to-face before the big fight.

Roach has underlined his complete confidence in Pacquiao ending Mayweather’s unbeaten record.

‘Floyd is so disrespectful,’ he said. ‘Manny is the perfect role model for this fight and Mayweather is not. I told Manny we’ve got to beat him for the whole world. There’s no way we can’t win this fight.

‘Floyd’s legs don’t move like they once did. He’s very clever but the fight is so big he may feel like he has to take a risk and exchange with us.

‘If he does that, that’s the best thing in the world for Manny in my mind.

‘Manny will be performing a public service for boxing when he beats Floyd.’
