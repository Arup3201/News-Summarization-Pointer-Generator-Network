The author of a Jane Austen biography has spoken out against a portrait that will appear on banknotes, claiming it makes the famous novelist look 'dim-witted'.

Paula Byrne, writer of The Real Jane Austen, said today she finds the selected image 'unforgivable' as she believes the author 'is made to look like a doll'.

Speaking on BBC 4's Today Programme, Dr Byrne compared the portrait to 'a Katie Price makeover'.

Dr Paula Byrne spoke out against the portrait of the famous author comparing it to a 'Katie Price make-over'

Dr Byrne said she felt the image was 'Victorian' and 'highly sentimentalised', suggesting it 'perpetuates this image she is a safe, cosy writer when she is not.'

She said: 'She is a subversive writer, a feminist writer that writes about the social classes' - adding the image had been 'airbrushed' to make the author seem more feminine.

But Elizabeth Proudman, of the Jane Austen Society in West Sussex, did not share the biographer's view.

'I agree her eyes are over-larged but she does not look like a doll,' said Ms Proudman, who helped the Bank of England in their selection of pictures.

After disagreeing with Dr Byrne's categorisation of the author as a 'proto-feminist', she said: 'Oh come off it. Yes it is prettified and yes she is wearing a bonnet but she always did.'

The image, known as the Memoir Portrait, is considered to be the only authentic painting of the author, which makes it difficult to know for certain what the she actually looked like.

It will replace Charles Darwin on Bank of England £10 notes in 2017, accompanied by the words: 'I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading.'

The line is taken from the 1813 novel Pride And Prejudice and is uttered by the character Miss Bingley - an unpleasant woman who has a crush on male protagonist Mr Darcy.

However, critics have poked holes in the choice of quotation - which is in fact a vain attempt to seduce Mr Darcy who is busy reading.

Indeed, in a bid to distract him from his own book, Miss Bingley professes her love of literature when in fact she is bored senseless with the evening she has spent with a book.

Today's heated discussion comes after
the discovery of a second painting of the writer which is said to portray her in a
different light.

A second painting was discovered in 2011 that Dr Byrne believes is a more accurate portrait of the author

Dr Byrne uncovered the work in 2011, which she believes shows a different side to the writer she hails as 'the funniest to walk the planet'.

She told the Christmas Times: 
'Scholars know there was so much more to her. And for me this new 
picture encapsulates – almost too perfectly – that other side.

'She's a professional woman 
presenting herself to the world with the tools of her trade. It's the 
image of Jane Austen so many of us have been waiting for.'

Speaking at the time of her discovery, she said the Memoir Portrait 'annoyed her' as it made the writer seem 'pretty and dim'.

The 1870 portrait selected by the Bank of England is based on a watercolor sketch by the author's sister, Cassandra Austen, completed in 1810.

It appeared in the pages of A Memoir Of Jane Austen, published after the author's death in 1817.

Written by the author's nephew James
Edward Austen-Leigh, the book has been criticised by experts for its 
domestic portrayal of Austen-Leigh's 'Dear Aunt Jane.'

A second edition was published in 1871, which included previously unknown material written by the Sense And Sensibility author.

The portrait of Jane Austen was selected in July after a lengthy campaign to see a female face on banknotes, following the announcement that Winston Churchill would replace Elizabeth Fry on £5 notes.

Florence Nightingale was the first woman to be featured, appearing on £10 notes from 1975 until 1994.

The decision sparked concern over an apparent lack of female representation as, aside from the Queen who appears on all notes, no women would have appeared.

Scottish philosopher, Adam Smith is currently the face of £20 notes, while steam engine manufacturers Matthew Boulton and James Watt appear on the new £50 notes.

Boulton and Watt replace Sir John Houblon, the first Governor of the Bank of England.
