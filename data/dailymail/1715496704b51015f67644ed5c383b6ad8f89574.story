Britain awoke to a blanket of frost this morning after temperatures plummeted to almost -4C on what was one of the coldest nights of the season so far.

Large swathes of the country experienced sub-zero temperatures as millions of people headed outside to enjoy Bonfire Night activities and firework displays.

The coldest temperature recorded last night was -3.8C in South Newington, Oxfordshire, which was closely followed by -3.7C in Topcliffe, North Yorkshire. The mercury also dropped to -2.8C in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire.

Although last year’s Bonfire Night was slightly colder, at -5C, yesterday was colder than the same night in 2009, 2010 and 2011.

Forecasters at the Met Office said widespread frost caused by last night’s plunging temperatures would be replaced by heavy rain across large parts of the country this afternoon.

Severe weather warnings have been issued for parts of Northern Ireland, where 80mm of rain is predicted to fall within the next 24 hours, and in Scotland where localised flooding is a possibility.

However, despite last night’s chilly temperatures, forecasters said the mercury would rise again this week, with temperatures returning to the November average of between 10C and 12C.

Mark Wilson, meteorologist for the Met Office, said: ‘Last night was a cold night, one of the coldest nights of the season far.

‘There’s been widespread frost this morning but cloud is thickening from the west and that heralds wet and windy weather pushing through.

‘If you’re in the south east, it will stay dry until after dark but elsewhere in the country it will turn wetter throughout the course of the day.

‘Weather warnings have been issued and in eastern parts of Northern Ireland we could see as much as 80mm of rain over the next 24 hours.’

Despite the heavy rain forecast for much of the UK today, Mr Wilson said the country would experience some respite from last night’s cold weather.

He said: ‘Tonight will be much, much milder than last night. The lowest temperature will be in the Scottish highlands and that will be around 4C to 5C so much milder.

'Over the coming days, temperatures are looking closer to average. Last night would have been the coldest night for the next few nights. 

'By day, temperatures will be in the 10C to 12C range generally.

'The weather remains largely unsettled though. 

'Tomorrow, the persistent rain will clear away, leaving a day of sunny spells and showers with strong, breezy winds.

'As we head into Saturday, unfortunately we see a pretty wet day across much of England and Wales.

‘There’s a band of rain pushing up towards the north east, affecting much of England and Wales during the day, but Scotland and Northern Ireland will see the best of the weather.

‘However, if you’re looking to get out and about this weekend, Sunday is definitely the better day. There will be one or two isolated showers but mostly sunny spells and lighter winds.’

Forecasters said it would get milder and temperatures would not plummet to below zero again this week. Pictured: Richmond Park

With severe weather warnings in place for Northern Ireland from 10.30am today until 8am tomorrow, Mr Wilson warned of the potential risk of localised flooding. 

A less-severe weather warning is also in place for much of Scotland today, which warns of heavy rain until 6pm on Friday.

Mr Wilson added: 'The public should be prepared for the risk of localised flooding. It’s not going to widespread but there is a risk of localised flooding – especially in the eastern areas of Northern Ireland.'

The first migrating Siberian swans of this year landed in Britain this morning - heralding the belated arrival of winter.

Each year around 300 Bewick swans flock to the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust reserve at Slimbridge, Gloucestershire, after flying more than 2,500 miles from Arctic Russia.

This year's arrival - coinciding with the first cold snap of the season - is the latest for 45 years.

It traditionally marks the beginning of winter as the birds head to Britain to escape the Arctic weather which follows closely behind them.

The first family of two adults and two cygnets touched down at 7.15am and the adults were identified as regulars Nurton and Nusa, who have been visiting the spot for the last five years.

Slimbridge swan expert Julia Newth said: 'This is the latest arrival date since 1969.

'It is no coincidence that their arrival has coincided with a change from the mild temperatures and south-westerly head winds that have dominated in recent weeks.

'We are excited to see that the first arrivals are a family because the swans desperately need more cygnets to bolster the dwindling population.'

The Bewicks - the smallest and rarest members of the swan family - live in Siberia during the summer. In winter they migrate west - aided by chilling easterly winds - to escape winter temperatures of -25C.

They normally arrive at Slimbridge in a steady stream between October and January.
