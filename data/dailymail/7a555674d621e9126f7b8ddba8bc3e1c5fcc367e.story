A man committed suicide in West Dallas on Wednesday by decapitating himself in front of horrified motorists.

Hugo Rodriguez, 35, tied a rope to a fire hydrant before wrapping the other end around his neck in Texas, before accelerating.  

Before the horrific act, the man scribbled a message on the side of the vehicle. The first two words appear to say 'no code' while the second part 'Codbo' could be a reference to the video game Call of Duty: Black Ops.

Horrific: A man killed himself in West Dallas by decapitating himself in his van. Before the horrific act he wrote a message believed to be in Spanish on the side of the vehicle

Witnesses described how he then got into his van and pressed on the throttle. 

His body was thrown out of the vehicle and was seen lying on the street by stunned drivers. 

According to CBS DFW the van eventually came to a stop without running into any cars or pedestrians. 

Witnesses described on social media how the body was still in the road hours later as police cleaned up the scene.

The message the man wrote on the side of his van could be related to computer game Call of Duty Black Ops

The van was eventually taken away while a cordon of patrol cars surrounded Mr Rodriguez's body.  

Police are now investigating the incident but revealed that no one else was hurt.

In the aftermath, shocked witnesses posted images online purportedly showing the victim still on the road.

Call of Duty Black Ops is a version of the computer game franchise that releases a new edition almost every year.

It is a first-person shooter that was developed in 2010 and is set in the Second World War and the Cold War. 

Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. 

Last year, a coroner in Britain stated that four teenage suicides were partly to blame on versions of the game. 

A spokesman for the Dallas Police Department told Mail Online: 'Witnesses observed the victim, Hugo Rodriguez a Latin male  tie a rope around a fire hydrant and then around his neck. 

'He got into his van and accelerated, causing the rope to tighten around his neck and decapitated himself. A suicide offense was documented.'

According to records he had been arrested a number of times for driving while intoxicated. 

A telephone listed at his address had been disconnected.  

To speak to a skilled, trained counselor, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline on 1800 273 8255. 

Investigation; Police would not reveal the details of the death, however witnesses described how the man's head became detached from his body as it was thrown out of the vehicle 

Shocking: Patrol cars surrounded the van at the side of the road while the victim's body lay in the street 

Scene: Witnesses described how the man attached one end of the rope to a fire hydrant and the other to his neck before getting in his van and pressing the throttle 

Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed

Call of Duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood-thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios.

Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed.

Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty.

French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012.

The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground.

In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin.

When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'.

Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles.
