Australian Sam Groth trades on the fact that he has the fastest serve in the world but even that was not enough to see off Roger Federer as he continued to cruise through the US Open.

Groth managed to get the speed gun — seemingly reliable at Flushing Meadows, which is not always the case — clocking 142mph but still the veteran Swiss got it back en route to a 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 victory that keeps him on schedule for an 18th Grand Slam title.

‘I think once you go past the 135mph mark everything is really fast, sometimes you just have to guess which side and close your eyes,’ said Federer, who could have been extended into a fourth set if he had not managed to break back from 2-4 down in the third.  

On his way: Federer won the match in straight sets against the 26-year-old Australian to reach the third round

Stretching: The second seed was made to work hard, and saw his serve broken in the second and third sets

Good contest: It was a clash of styles but Federer was just too good after Groth had made him work

Power: The Australian fired down serves of up to 147mph during the match, but it wasn't enough

All smiles: Federer salutes the crowd after his victory as the men's top seeds continue to their fine start

Next up: Marcel Granollers, who beat Ivo Karlovic on Friday, will be Federer's third round opponent

He added: ‘You can often tell when they’re really going to crank it up. I can guess to within two mph how fast a serve is. I was really pleased how I handled it tonight.’

For all the danger of Groth’s serve this has been yet another Major when Federer has been blessed by a good draw, and his third round opponent is Spain’s Marcel Granollers, who beat another huge server, Ivo Karlovic, three sets to two.
