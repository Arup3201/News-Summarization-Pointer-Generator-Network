The woes have increased for Queens Park Rangers, with the club fearing they will lose star striker Charlie Austin in the summer and their accounts showing they could still face a Financial Fair Play fine of nearly £58million.

The club are in deep relegation trouble, three points adrift of safety, and have a crucial match away to Crystal Palace at lunchtime on Saturday.

They have not won in their previous 11 matches against London clubs and the game will be played against a backdrop of an uncertain future.

Manager Chris Ramsey insists that Charlie Austin will not be allowed to leave QPR for a paltry fee

Manager Chris Ramsey admitted that Austin, whose contract runs out at the end of next season, could leave in the summer, but is adamant they will not let him go for a paltry fee.

Austin has been in red-hot form in his debut season in the Barclays Premier League with 15 goals — just behind Harry Kane on 16 and top scorers Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa on 17.

The 25-year-old has played his way into contention when Roy Hodgson announces his England squad next week to play in the Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania and friendly versus Italy later this month. Hodgson was at Loftus Road to see Austin score a fine strike against Arsenal 10 days ago, despite Rangers losing.

Ramsey admitted: ‘When somebody sparkles there’s always people in there to poach them or to buy them and make their clubs better.

‘So we would be foolish not to be worried we’re going to lose him. We hope we don’t and we’re glad he’s performed in a way that other teams are trying to secure his services.

‘He’s one of the top strikers in the country, it’s not my decision whether he stays or goes, but any top striker always goes for top dollar.’

QPR have opened talks with Austin over a new, £60,000-a-week deal, but he is keen to wait until the end of the season before making a decision.

To make matters worse, the club’s financial accounts for the 2013-14 season when they were in the Championship, filed at Companies House on Friday, show that their ‘real’ losses last season were almost £70m. The Football League’s complex FFP rules are designed to discourage rich owners buying success and endangering the health of their clubs. A tariff of fines is in place for clubs that massively overspend.

Earlier this month, QPR announced they had made a loss of £9.8m but the accounts now prove the smaller loss figure was only possible because of owners — mainly Tony Fernandes — wrote off £60m of old loans in an ‘exceptional item’ in the accounts.

Effectively, QPR counted that write-off as extra income. But that money is noted in the accounts as being a ‘related-party transaction’ — and the Football League’s own FFP regulations explicitly rule out related party moves of the kind QPR have undertaken, to prevent ‘artificially’ lowered losses. If the League decide QPR’s ‘real’ losses are £69.8m, the FFP fine they potentially face will be £57.9m.

QPR declined to comment and remain in talks with the Football League. Whatever is decided, refusal to pay a fine could result in their expulsion to non-League football.
