Here was one encounter with Liverpool when Nigel Pearson would have been more justified in rattling off a few expletives.

Last month Pearson was given a touchline ban after letting rip at one of his club’s fans when provoked during his side’s 3-1 defeat at home by Liverpool. On Sunday, Leicester’s manager remained rather restrained, calling only for the introduction of video technology to avoid the kind of decisions that proved so costly to his struggling side.

But the first of two penalties that were awarded to Liverpool would have angered any manager at Anfield, given that Mike Jones punished Wes Morgan for handball when Raheem Sterling’s cross struck the Leicester captain square in the face.

Steven Gerrard’s two penalties took Liverpool’s goal tally from the spot to 100 in the Premier League, more than any other side have managed. 

Any sense of injustice was softened for Pearson by the response from his players: two stunning second-half goals from David Nugent and Jeffrey Schlupp in less than two minutes that underlined just how well they performed. But when a team sits bottom they need wins, not draws, and Pearson will regard this as two points lost rather than one gained.

It was one of those games that leaves both managers feeling a little bruised; the frustration for Brendan Rodgers his side’s failure to build on the momentum of successive victories.

If Rodgers thought his side had turned a corner with that dynamic display against Swansea on Monday night, they seemed to run into a bit of a dead end again here.

Philippe Coutinho delivered another fine attacking performance but as a team Liverpool certainly lacked the flair and pace of that 4-1 demolition of Swansea, instead showing the usual defensive frailties that explain why they are conceding as many goals as they score this season.

Rodgers acknowledged his players made ‘too many mistakes’, even if he also complained of ‘fatigue’ in this busy Christmas period. It will give him no pleasure to learn that this was only the third time in the Premier League that Liverpool have thrown away a two-goal lead. 

Buoyed by a first win in 99 days last weekend, Leicester started this encounter in some style. They were the better team and, had the excellent Riyad Mahrez been more accurate with his finishing, could have been ahead.

After little more than a minute Mahrez had seen a free kick bounce off a stranded Simon Mignolet’s left-hand post and the Algerian should have scored a few minutes later when Schlupp escaped Emre Can. Mahrez sent his close-range shot both high and wide.

A Liverpool side strengthened by the return of Gerrard but short of goalscoring options, with Mario Balotelli not even on the bench bceause of injury, according to a club spokesman, offered little until that controversial 17th-minute penalty. 

Coutinho sparked the move that led to the incident that so incensed Leicester, sending Sterling clear with a marvellous pass. But Morgan did everything you might expect from a captain and central defender, moving swiftly to recover the ground on the young England forward and launching himself to block the shot.

For showing such courage and athleticism Morgan really deserved better. Gary Lineker was so angry he described it on Twitter as the ‘worst decision ever’; a measure as much of his passion for Leicester as a referee’s incompetence.

Hapless referee Mike Jones started the new year as he refereed throughout the old one by awarding Liverpool a penalty when the ball appeared to hit Leicester's Wes Morgan on the head as he slid to block Raheem Sterling's cross. 

Jones clearly thought that the ball had hit the arm of Morgan but replays showed that was not the case. 

Referees are told that it can be understandable if they miss incidents but it is not acceptable to give something that has not happened. 

Mahrez would threaten again with a free kick that was deflected over Mignolet’s crossbar but with Coutinho very much at the centre of things Liverpool were playing with more purpose. Adam Lallana went close and when Coutinho darted into the area and attempted to lift the ball into the path of his advancing team-mates, Danny Simpson foolishly halted its progress with an outstretched hand. Pearson thought it harsh as well but this time Jones got it right. It was handball and Gerrard struck again, six minutes before the break.

From a corner Liverpool then tried something rather more spectacular, with Lallana inviting Henderson to try his luck with a volley from outside the 18-yard box. Henderson connected beautifully, but his effort whistled just wide.

The first half concluded with Pearson talking to a police officer who was patrolling the technical area. He joked afterwards that he had not been arrested. After the break Alberto Moreno very nearly increased Liverpool’s lead, but with the loss of Lallana to a thigh injury after 55 minutes came a slight loss of impetus.

Within four minutes Leicester had scored, Jamie Vardy chesting a ball forward from Matty James into the path of Nugent and inviting the former England striker to score with a spectacular hitch-kick style half-volley.

No sooner had the game restarted than Leicester struck again, with Schlupp guiding a left-foot shot from outside the penalty area past Can and beyond Mignolet, who for some reason did not even move.

Further opportunities would follow for both sides, with Jones opting not to award another penalty against Morgan for a challenge on Fabio Borini. If he was feeling more generous towards Morgan after that first-half error, it was the least Leicester deserved.
