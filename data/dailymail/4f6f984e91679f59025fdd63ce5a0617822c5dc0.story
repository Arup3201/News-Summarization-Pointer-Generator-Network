The video of the moment when a gay rights activist heckled the First Lady was caught on tape and has now been released to show the tense exchange.

After she was interrupted, Michelle Obama threatened to leave the Democratic National Committee fundraiser unless the activist, identified later as Ellen Sturtz, was removed.

'It felt like she was within a few inches – in my face,' Ms Sturtz told ABC News, in an account that several witnesses have corroborated.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

The beginning: Michelle Obama was speaking at a DNC fundraiser on Tuesday when she was interrupted by a heckler

Taking action: She then stepped down from the platform and went right up to the heckler and had words before walking in the other direction and flashing her hand

The video, obtained by CNN, shows how the First Lady got down from her platform and went directly over to the heckler and told her to stop or else she was going to leave and allow her to finish.

The crowd cheered for Mrs Obama and told the heckler to stop talking.

The First Lady then walked aside, going over to talk to other supporters briefly- as if to shake off the incident- before returning to the lectern.

Starting off smiling: The First Lady approached the heckler with a smile but when the woman would not stop Mrs Obama turned stiff

Losing her cool: The heckler said that the First Lady 'got up in her face'

Striking a deal: She offered the choice of her leaving or the heckler

With the crowd cheering for her, she headed back on stage to continue the talk on education

Moments before the confrontation, 
Sturtz had interrupted Obama to demand that her husband sign an 
executive order barring discrimination by federal contractors based on 
sexual orientation.

Don't mess: Mrs Obama said dealing with hecklers was 'one thing I'm not good at'

'One 
of the things I don't do well is this,' Mrs Obama replied to loud 
applause, according to a pool report. 'Listen to me or you can take the 
mic, but I’m leaving. You all decide. You have one choice.'

The
 crowd urged the first lady to stay, and she returned to the podium to 
continue speaking. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later said 
that Mrs Obama handled the interruption 'brilliantly.'

Sturtz
 described herself to ABC News as an 'old, grey-haired lesbian' and said
 she felt compelled to interrupt Mrs Obama because she doesn't feel she 
has the time to wait around for action on gay rights.

'I’m too old to wait for it,' she said. 'I don’t want to see us continue to be second-class citizens.'

Sturtz is an activist for the pro-LGBT rights group GetEQUAL and she was one of four protestors a the event.

But when the White House's transcript arrived, The Daily Caller
 reported Tuesday night, it didn't include any indication of an 
acrimonious exchange -- and was missing Mrs. Obama's threat to leave the
 event.

The only indication in that transcript that anything was amiss is a note about an '(Inaudible audience interruption.)'

Back to the routine: After asking the audience if they wanted the heckler to talk or for the First Lady to continue speaking, she decided to go back up on stage

'I lived and worked in the closet, hiding who I was in order to earn a living,' Sturtz said in a statement late Tuesday night.

GetEQUAL activist Ellen Sturtz heckled Michelle Obama on Tuesday night, demanding that the president sign an executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating in their hiring on the basis of sexual orientation

'I had planned to speak tonight with DNC officials but, as the First Lady was talking about our children's future and ensuring that they have everything they need to live happy and productive lives, I simply couldn't stay silent any longer.'

'I'm looking ahead at a generation of young people who could live full, honest, and open lives with the stroke of the President's pen,' she insisted.

The home where the heckling happened 
belongs to power couple Karen Dixon and Nan Schaffer, formerly of 
Chicago, who have hosted fundraisers for the Obamas in the past, 
including one that raised $1.4 million for the president's reelection 
campaign in February 2012.

Dixon is an attorney who serves on the national board of Lambda Legal, an organization working for LGBT rights.

Her spouse, Schaffer, is a 
veterinarian who works to preserve the rhino population through 
artificial insemination.

She is also a minority shareholder in Windy 
City Media Group and founded Outlines, a Chicago newspaper, in 1987.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But
 White House Press Secretary Jay Carney took an oddly coincidental 
question earlier in the day during his regularly scheduled briefing 
about the same discrimination issue that had Sturtz shouting at the top 
of her lungs.

A reporter asked Carney for a 
progress report on 'a study of LGBT workplace discrimination possibly 
led by the Council of Economic Advisors,' which was commissioned in 2012
 after the president declined to sign an executive order banning the 
practice.

'I don't have any
 updated status on that for you,' Carney said. 'I can tell you that the 
president has long supported, as you know, an inclusive Employment 
Non-Discrimination Act. ... And his administration will continue to work
 to build support for it.'

White House press secretary Jay Carney took a moment Tuesday from his 'patent troll' discussion to parry a question about the presidents plan to ban federal contractors' workplace discrimination against gays

'The president's record on support for LGBT rights is significant and well known,' Obama's chief spokesman added.

Mr.
 Obama, he said, 'believes that the right approach to this problem is an
 inclusive piece of legislation, and that’s the approach that we're 
taking.  It was the approach that we took with repeal of "don't ask, 
don't tell."  And we continue to support this effort.'
