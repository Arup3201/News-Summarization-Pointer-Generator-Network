The study of Roe deer fawns in France found that more young are dying than in the past due to earlier springs

Roe deer fawns are struggling to survive earlier springs, scientists have warned.

A study of the forest-loving deer in the Champagne region of France found that more young are dying than in the past.

This is blamed on the animals still giving birth at the same time, despite temperatures rising and spring starting two weeks earlier than a quarter of a century ago.

An early spring birth allows the mothers to feast on the young shoots and leaves needed to make her milk nutritious.

Some other birds and animals have been shown to keep up with the changing climate because their breeding is triggered by temperature.

In contrast, it is thought the roe deerâ€™s complex reproductive pattern, in which pregnancy is put on pause for several months after the rut, is dependent on day length.

The roe deer is Britainâ€™s most widespread deer species and the researchers, from UniversitÃ© Lyon 1, said it is likely fawns are also struggling to survive here.

In contrast red deer are adapting to earlier springs, with a long-term UK study showing the females are giving birth earlier and earlier.

Red deer also build-up body reserves ahead of giving birth and tend to only have fawn at a time, while roe deer routinely give birth to twins, the journal PLoS Biology reports.
