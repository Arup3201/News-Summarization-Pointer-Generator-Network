It only took about 10 minutes. 'F*** off Cesc Fabregas' was the poisonous chant that cascaded down from the Arsenal fans in one corner, once they'd finally all got in for this highly-charged London derby.

303 appearances, 57 goals, innumerable moments of magic, all those afternoons of glory - all lost amid football's tribal atmosphere.

Fabregas's achievements at Arsenal, who he represented for eight seasons and captained, quickly forgotten by some with short memories after his move to their rivals in the blue corner of London.

On the pitch, vicious tackles flew in. In the stands, barbs were traded. On the touchline, Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho squared up like protagonists in a playground scrap.

And down there in the maelstrom, one man just got on with the job he's always done with such class and distinction. For Fabregas, this was just business as usual.

He would have cared little for the Arsenal taunts - bygones are bygones, what's done is done. He is loving life at Stamford Bridge, as Mourinho asserted in the build-up. There are no regrets at all.

Fabregas's performance in Chelsea's 2-0 win reminded you of the opening lines of Rudyard Kipling's 'If': 'If you can keep your head when all about you/Are losing theirs and blaming it on you.'

The Spaniard may not be about to inherit the Earth and everything in it, but more displays like this and Chelsea will certainly win the Premier League.

Arsenal are imposters to triumph, blown away again by Chelsea, whom they now trail by nine points in the table.

Fabregas's afternoon was a masterclass in consistency. His passing was measured, metronomic as usual. He played 69 passes with an accuracy of 88.4 per cent. Jack Wilshere, by contrast, made just 43 passes, Mesut Ozil 56.

His heat map shows Fabregas as an omnipresence in the midfield, popping up right across the wide sweep of his own half. He recovered possession on 13 separate occasions.

But the Catalan artist left his piece de resistance until right near the end. A magnificent ball over the top of the Arsenal defence that picked out Diego Costa. The rest was inevitable; a deft chip over the hopelessly stranded Wojciech Szczesny.

Mourinho went the extra mile to ensure Fabregas chose Chelsea over Arsenal or Manchester City in the summer, flying out to Spain for a personal audience within days of learning Barcelona had made him available.

He wooed the World Cup-winner with a promise that he would be the keystone in Chelsea's midfield, and so it has proved.

His assist in Costa's goal was his fourth for his compatriot already this season and his seventh overall, more than any Chelsea player managed in the whole of last season.

Little wonder Roman Abramovich was on his feet in the director's box punching the air in delight. The £62m on those two could well be the best money he's ever spent. 

A delay to kick-off as Arsenal fans were held up getting in to Stamford Bridge wouldn't have helped Fabregas's pre-match nerves but once he got a first feel for the ball, he was irrepressible.

Arsenal believed Fabregas had handled in Wilshere's shot but the referee was unmoved

He didn't misplace a pass inside the first 20 minutes and made a perfectly-timed tackle on compatriot Santi Cazorla. A nicely flighted free-kick from the right was met by Nemanja Matic, but in an offside position.

Always available to receive a pass, he pinged the ball about with characteristic ease and soon he was initiating the move with the steal that led to Eden Hazard winning - and then converting - a 26th-minute penalty.

In the second-half, Fabregas robbed Ozil of the ball as the German shaped to shoot on the edge of the box. Within seconds, Chelsea were in Arsenal's penalty box.

It was indicative of his dominance over the German - and the rest of Arsenal's midfield - in all departments. 

There was one moment when Wilshere's shot may have been blocked by Fabregas's hand but referee Martin Atkinson was unmoved by the appeals.  

And it was certainly accurately reflected in the final outcome as Chelsea's juggernaut rolled on.
