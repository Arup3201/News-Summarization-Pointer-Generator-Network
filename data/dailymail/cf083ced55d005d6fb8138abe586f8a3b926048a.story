Undertaker: Michael O'Brien, 59, is pictured arriving at Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester

An undertaker was behind bars in disgrace today for swindling thousands of pounds out of the elderly as they planned their own funerals.

Michael O'Brien, 59, mis-sold several funeral plans during his five years of scams and even pocketed cash donations left in envelopes by grieving well-wishers intended for charities.

O’Brien - who also stole £1,000 which a grieving family had paid out for a headstone - was arrested after various complaints over his shady practises at his family firm Murray’s Funeral Services in Dukinfield, Greater Manchester.

Police raided the funeral parlour last October to find a large haul of cheques dating back to 2005 which well-wishers had asked to be forwarded into charities including Macmillan Cancer Support and the British Heart Foundation.

Cash donations were never received by the intended recipients. Human ashes were also seized by police and handed to council officials who stored them at a nearby crematorium.

Inquiries revealed O’Brien, who owned a number of funeral homes over the last 30 years, carried out the frauds after his business which was previously run by his father ran into difficulty.

At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, he hung his head in shame as he was jailed for eight months after admitting three charges of fraud and nine offences under consumer protection regulations.

Judge Andrew Lowcock told O’Brien: ‘It’s very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court. You had, prior to these events, led a blameless life. Yet you conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour.’

Earlier the court heard how O’Brien’s firm was already sliding into bankruptcy when he targeted elderly people who did not want to burden surviving relatives with their funeral costs.

Four victims including an elderly couple aged 86 and 92 agreed to pay between £2,300 to £3,000 each for funeral plans not realising they were worthless as they were not backed by any insurance.

They were also unaware O’Brien was not regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority due to his financial difficulties.

Intended recipient: Between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received

It meant families didn’t realise they would lose their money once O’Brien’s business went bankrupt in January 2013, meaning no funds were available for customers seeking refunds.

One widower who took out a £3,019 plan with O’Brien after his wife died, tried to get a refund after getting a deal with Age UK - only to get nothing.

Another family paid out almost £5,000 to O’Brien including £1,080 for a headstone in memory of a retired builder who died aged 64 of cancer. The funeral went ahead but no headstone materialised.

O’Brien was called in by police for interview but said he could not attend because he was in hospital.

Failure to attend another interview forced officers to contact the hospital to find out he was not currently a patient there and he was arrested at home where officers found paperwork relating to the charity donations.

During inquiries police discovered between June 2010 and February 2013 O’Brien had received donations totalling £945 intended for Macmillan Cancer Support.

In February 2011 he had received £190 worth of donations for Tameside General Hospital in memory of a local lady who died.

And between September and December 2013 at least £800 was donated to the British Heart Foundation in memory of two men who died. None of the donations were ever received.

Prosecutor Miss Leila Ghahhary said: ‘These persons were vulnerable, through age, infirmity or bereavement. In addition the victims have suffered stress and anxiety.

‘In selling the funeral plans, the defendant falsely advised them that there would be insurance to back them up. In fact none of the plans had security and were effectively worthless.

‘He took money from plans when he knew his business was in difficulty and been made bankrupt. In 2005 his father and business partner had died and the defendant ran into financial difficulty.

‘In 2011 he had difficulties with various loans and credit cards. Since the death of his father he was incapable of keeping up the finances, robbing Peter to pay Paul and to meet his financial commitments.’

The court heard the cost of the frauds totalled £13,234 with the total sum of mis-sold funeral plans - £10,219, the cost of the head stone £1,080 and the total known sum of charity donations - £1,935 of which £530 was cash.

'You conned people at their most vulnerable whether through age, illness or bereavement. Trying to support your business is not an excuse for this behaviour'

Judge Andrew Lowcock

The court heard O’Brien always provided a funeral but the money he received for the plans went into propping up his business and not into the holding accounts of customers.

In mitigation for O’Brien, defence Simeon Evans said: ‘He has never been in trouble previously and was considered a pillar of the community - both him and his father before him. He provided funerals as affordable as possible.

‘He would have done everything in his power to provide funerals for the people in this case.

‘He had always intended to pay these cash sums across to the various charities. He instead used them to pay for the day to day running, for the funerals he was contracted for.

‘His financial situation has been disastrous for many years. He would say he is a very good undertaker and a very bad business man.’

But after the case Fiona Smith, 39, who was never provided with a headstone for her late father Francis Hancock, 64, said: ‘We trusted him completely. Seeing this man jailed is justice for my dad. It was his money. He would have been fuming.’

Ian Saxon, Tameside Council’s assistant executive director of environmental services, said ‘Mr O’Brien caused a great deal of misery and heartache for a number of individuals and families who have suffered financial loss as result of his fraudulent actions.’
