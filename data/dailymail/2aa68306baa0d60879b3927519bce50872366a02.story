He signed up to serve his country aged just 16 and was deployed to Afghanistan weeks after his 18th birthday.

But now Private Tom Wroe is dead – murdered by one of the Afghan policemen British forces have been sent to train.

The
recruit had begged for help, claiming he had hurt his foot on a patrol –
then slaughtered Private Wroe and Sergeant Gareth Thursby with an 
assault rifle when they went to offer first aid.

Today Nato announced that they are scaling back operations with Afghan forces in the wake of the so-called 'green on blue' shootings -  where allied troops are 
killed by the Afghan soldiers or policemen that they are trying to train
or are working alongside.

Tributes: Married father-of-two Sergeant Gareth 
Thursby, 29, and Private Thomas Wroe, 18, were shot dead in the south of
Nahr-e Saraj district, Helmand province

The move, which could jeopardise the 
U.S.-led coalition's key goal to get Afghan forces ready to take over 
security from foreign forces by the end of 2014, is intended to lower 
the risk of insider attacks and reduce local tensions over an anti-Islam
video that prompted protests in Afghanistan.

Sergeant Thursby, 29 – who leaves a 
wife, Louise, and two children, Joshua, ten, and Ruby, four – and 
Private Wroe were due home within days.

The deaths prompted a furious reaction from 
MPs and relatives yesterday – who demanded that troops were brought home
from an ‘unwinnable war’.

Prince Harry was moved to a guarded location during a recent Taliban attack on Camp Bastion, the Defence Secretary has revealed.

Philip Hammond had earlier told the Commons that Captain Wales - as Harry is known to the Army - was never in danger although he was present during the assault on Bastion last Friday.

He later explained that the 28-year-old is being protected by 'additional security arrangements' as he carries out his second tour of duty in Afghanistan.

Speaking on BBC 2's Newsnight last night, he said: 'Clearly there are fall-back plans and I can't go into the detail of them - but once we knew on Friday night that the perimeter at Bastion had been breached he would have been moved to a secure position under effective guard.'

Asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman if that meant Prince Harry was not treated the same as every other soldier, the Defence Secretary said: 'You asked me whether he was at any greater risk.

'And I've told you that in combat he's at the same risk as any other Apache pilot.

'Clearly if we had a VIP in theatre and frankly if I was there or, Jeremy, if you were there in Camp Bastion and there was a breach of the perimeter security, anybody who might, by nature of who they are, be a target, they would be put in a secure location.'

He added: 'He is serving there as an ordinary officer but clearly there are additional security arrangements in place that recognise that he could be a target himself specifically as a result of who he is.'

Rogue security forces have carried out
37 attacks this year, killing 51 coalition troops.

The toll includes 
nine British servicemen – a quarter of the 35 killed in 2012 – and part 
of an overall UK casualty toll of 430.

Last night it was claimed the gunman 
in the latest case was related to a Taliban leader – again highlighting 
gaping flaws in vetting Afghan recruits.

As tributes were paid to the latest victims:

Yesterday Sergeant Thursby’s stepfather Brain Whitaker, 58, said UK troops were fighting a ‘losing battle’.

Mr Whitaker, who lives with Gareth’s 
mother, Caroline, 49, in Padiham, Lancashire, added: ‘We just feel numb 
at the moment but it is absolutely ridiculous that our troops are still 
out there.

‘Gareth’s death just shows that these 
people don’t want us there and as soon as we leave the Taliban will be 
back in power. This war is totally and utterly pointless.’

Sergeant Thursby is from Skipton, 
North Yorkshire, and his young comrade is from Holmfirth, West 
Yorkshire. Both belonged to 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment.

Building up the ANSF to a strength of 
370,000 is the key plank of Nato’s strategy for withdrawing combat 
troops from the conflict.

International soldiers are training 
and mentoring Afghan forces so they can assume responsibility for the 
country’s security by the end of 2014. To build bonds between the 
forces, they live, work and sleep together in small bases.

But the danger has increased as 
insurgents have infiltrated the Afghan ranks and the Taliban has 
encouraged them to kill their international mentors to undermine the 
mission.

In March six 3 Yorks soldiers died 
after a roadside bomb blew up their Warrior armoured vehicle – the 
Army’s worst single loss of life in the war.

Guard: Earlier this week, two Marines were killed and several more wounded at Camp Bastion in Afghanistan

Other fatality: Lance Corporal Duane Groom, 32, from 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards, died on Friday after his vehicle hit a roadside bomb

Private Wroe’s family said he was 
‘buzzing’ to deploy to Afghanistan. His comrades in 3 Yorks had arrived 
there in the spring but he had to remain in the UK until he turned 18.

His mother Claire, 39, a care home 
deputy manager, said: ‘He couldn’t wait to go. He wanted to go and join 
all his mates, he was so excited.’

His father, Mick, 48 – who served 22 
years in the Duke of Wellington’s Regiment, which became 3 Yorks – said:
‘He was a proper little soldier. He just wanted to be in the Army. It’s
all he ever wanted to do.’

In a statement to the Commons, Mr 
Hammond admitted the rapid expansion of the ANSF meant vetting ‘might 
not have been entirely adequate’.

All Afghan soldiers and policemen are 
undergoing a stringent re-screening programme when they return from 
leave, said Mr Hammond. But he acknowledged it was impossible to 
‘eliminate the risk entirely’.

Former Labour minister Denis MacShane 
said: ‘Why are we still allowing our soldiers to be sacrificed to no 
evident purpose?’ He said UK forces were dying in ‘an unwinnable 
conflict for an unobtainable end, to no strategic benefit for our 
country’.

Colonel Tim Collins, a former 
commanding officer of the 1st Battalion the Royal Irish Regiment, said: 
‘We have expanded very rapidly the Afghan National Security Forces and 
the net effect is that people who would not otherwise have been put in 
uniform, the undesirables, have been admitted.’

The term green on blue refers to a 
colour-coding system used by the US military. Nato forces are blue and 
Afghans are green, hence the term for friendly-fire incidents as ‘blue 
on blue’. The enemy is usually denoted as red.
