The days of women gazing enviously at photographs of whippet-thin celebrities such as Alexa Chung and Kate Moss are drawing to a glorious close.

In the wake of the UK Summer Of Sporting Love (aka the 2012 Olympics), the British female of the species has decided collectively that being athletic is definitely preferable to looking as though you really need to eat a few biscuits.

And our champion heptathlete Jessica Ennis, 26, is leading the way, topping a poll of women whose bodies are most appreciated by women and men alike.

Thanks to Jessica Ennis, winner of the 2012 Olympics women's heptathlon, British women would now much rather be athletic than skinny

The newly termed 'Jessica Ennis effect' means that 72 per cent of women would now prefer to have an athletic figure rather than a skinny one - and 35 per cent say they feel 'repulsed' when they see pictures of super-skinny celebrities.

Furthermore, 81 per cent of men quizzed reveled they would rather date someone with an athletic figure.

Sheffield's Olympic golden girl even beat the likes of curvy Kelly Brook and voluptuous Kim Kardashian to top a national poll of the most desirable celebrity bodies.

According to a survey conducted by bootcamp company Lifestyle247, a strong, athletic female physique is now the top figure admired and lusted after by women and men alike.

And Ennis gained the most votes when respondents were asked to select their most desirable and aspirational celebrity figures.

More than a third of women even admitted they 
feel 'repulsed' at the sight of skinny celebrities in the media, 
indicating a backlash over unrealistic and unhealthy body ideals and a 
surge in popularity of the London Games message that 'strong is sexy'.

Olympic
fever also caused a surge in the British public looking to train like 
their favourite athletes.

Some 71 per cent of those polled revealing 
they felt more inspired to get fit due to the Olympics and Paralympics.

Lifestyle247 bootcamps saw a 68 per cent increase in 
enquiries during the Olympics thanks to the athletics-based training methods it uses.

And
women who are deciding to take up exercise are doing so more with the 
intention of becoming toned and sculpted rather than of losing weight.

Yasmin Mohammed, founder of Lifestyle
247 Bootcamps, said: 'Our bootcamps are structured to help clients gain
the qualities of an athlete – endurance, strength, focus and 
determination – and during the Olympics we noticed a surge of interest.

'We
have noticed our female clients are more focused on toning and 
sculpting their bodies as opposed to just losing weight and many 
commented on how desirable Jessica Ennis' body was during the Olympics –
the most enviable body part being her abs!

'Not
only have the Olympics and Paralympics shifted disability and gender 
perceptions - this has been the first Games in which women could compete
in every sport, and there were more women in Team GB than ever before -
but they also seem to have given us a new generation of role models to 
aspire to, whose bodies are admired for their physical strength and 
ability and not solely on their visual appearance.'
