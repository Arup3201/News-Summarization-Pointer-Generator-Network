They went out for a morning drive to see if they could find any early New Year's Day deals.

But when Dick and Lil Dickens, both in their 80s, pulled up outside what they thought was a jumble sale at a warehouse in March, Cambridgeshire, they got more than they bargained for.

They had stumbled across the closing stages of an alleged illegal rave where more than 1,000 people had been dancing the night away.

There were plenty of party-goers still inside the building and one of them seized the opportunity to get a picture of the couple with other apparent clubbers.

The couple pulled into the warehouse car park after seeing other vehicles there, believing it was a jumble sale of some kind

Mr Dickens, of Turves, said: 'We had been out shopping and we saw all these cars outside. There was no music or anything like that. The cars were parked all over the place. We thought it was a sale.

'I don't think we were the only ones as there were several people wandering over to see what was going on.

'We had a look in and that was it. When we realised that it wasn't a sale we left. We're in our 80s so we don't want to get mixed up in anything like that.

Paul Allen, 27, who took the picture, said the couple seemed 'a bit surprised' to see all the people in the warehouse but ended up 'having as good time as anybody else.'

Mr Allen said: 'When they came in we thought they were going to have a bit of a moan but they were alright with us.

'They seemed like a decent little couple.'

An estimated £50,000 worth of damage was allegedly caused to the warehouse, which belongs to 63-year-old businessman John Finn as a result of the all-night party.

The owner of the building said that damage to the building from the alleged illegal rave cost £50,000 to repair

Police are investigating the rave which took place on New Year's Eve and continued well into the next day

It is alleged the revellers ripped 
down ceilings, smashed doors and police believe they were high on 
ecstasy, cocaine and nitrous oxide - laughing gas..

Despite
being aware of the rave, Cambridgeshire Constabulary made the decision 
not to break it up because it was neither practical nor safe for 
officers to disrupt the event.

North east Cambridgeshire MP Steve Barclay said he was 'horrified' by the damage to the warehouse

The
police force has since launched Operation Silwood to prosecute those 
who staged the massive party and officers made their first arrest last 
week.

North east 
Cambridgeshire MP Steve Barclay has demanded prosecutions and 
highlighted the all-night rave during a meeting with Home Secretary 
Theresa May.

Mrs May said: 'This event showed a blatant disregard for the owners of this property who were left to pick up the pieces.

'It's essential that those responsible are brought to justice.

'I know the police will do everything they can to bring their investigation to a successful conclusion and welcome the fact they have made it a priority to apprehend the organisers.'

Mr Barclay said he was 'horrified' by the damage caused to the warehouse.

Speaking to his local newspaper, Mr Barclay said: “I think the Home Secretary’s comments show how serious this is.

'We need to nip this in the bud before someone else’s property is targeted.

'This was not just the case of a few youngsters getting together and drinking in a field and having a good time.

'This was serious criminality causing serious damage, with the culprits breaking into a business premises and using illegal drugs.'
