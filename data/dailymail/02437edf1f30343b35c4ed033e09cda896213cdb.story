Daniel LaPoint Jr and Eric Witzke could feel it in their bones that they found something extraordinary when their digging tools unearthed a grey skeleton in a Michigan backyard.

LaPoint, a contractor, and his neighbor at first thought they had uncovered dinosaur fossils on Witzke's property in Bellevue.

But what the pair of amateur archaeologists actually found were 42 massive mastodon bones.

Lucky find: In this January 7 photo, Dan LaPoint, right, and Eric Witzke, pose with just a few of the many ancient mastodon bones they unearthed while excavating a pond on Witzke's property outside Olivet, Michigan

Ancient creature: Experts were able to determine that the 42 bones are from a 37-year-old male mastodon and are between 10,000 and 14,000 years old

The prehistoric mammals, distantly related to modern elephants, roamed North and Central America for over a million years before they suddenly went extinct at the end of the last ice age more than 10,000 years ago.

After four days of digging with LaPoint's excavator, he and Witzke contacted an expert at the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology, who was able to examine and confirm their chance discovery, reported Lansing State Journal. 

Museum Director Daniel Fisher said the bones are from a 37-year-old male mastodon and are between 10,000 and 14,000 years old.

The museum will be able to narrow the exact age within 200 or 300 years once it has received the bones.

LaPoint and Witzke plan to keep a few of the bones and give the rest to the museum later this month.

About 330 confirmed mastodon bones have been discovered in Michigan.

Bag of bones: The Bellevue fossils include leg, shoulder and hip bones, multiple ribs, the base of a tusk and bits of the mastodon's vertebrae (pictured) 

Got a bone to pick: Most of the bones will be donated to University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology later this month

The Bellevue fossils include leg, shoulder and hip bones, multiple ribs, the base of a tusk and bits of the mastodon's vertebrae.

Before donating their remarkable find to science, the neighbors took the mastodon bones to Olivet Community College where a group of excited middle-schoolers got a chance to handle the remains of the long-extinct extinct ice-age creature.

‘To change one kid's life because they got to touch it, I think, is an incredible opportunity.’ LaPoint said, calling the discovery a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
