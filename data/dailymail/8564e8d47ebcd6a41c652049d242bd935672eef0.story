A £19 billion 'EuroVegas' casino resort the size of 750 football pitches is to be built in Spain.

The huge complex on the outskirts of Madrid will include 12 hotels, six casinos, a convention centre, three golf courses, theaters, shopping centres, bars and restaurants.

The development will take 18 years to build and create 260,000 jobs.

The project will provide a massive boost to the local economy in Spain which has a huge deficit and unemployment running at 26 per cent.

The mastermind behind the scheme is 79-year-old American tycoon, Sheldon Adelson, and his company Las Vegas Sands Corp.

Las Vegas Sands operates casinos and entertainment complexes in several locations around the world, including Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore.

Michael Leven, Las Vegas Sands CEO, said the group will cover 35 percent of the equity investment and assured Madrid authorities that funding to complete the rest of the project would be found. It was not clear where the remaining 65 percent will come from.

Mr Leven said Spanish banks would be among the investors, but he did not reveal which.

Despite the apparently large inward investment and the potential for massive job creation, EuroVegas has been met with rejection in many sectors of Spanish society.

More than a dozen organizations, mainly linked to environmental causes or to the political left, last year created the 'Eurovegas No' platform to oppose the project.

The group reacted to yesterday’s announcement by saying Las Vegas Sands wanted to create an 'island' for gambling and will count on specially granted tax breaks and the relaxation of laws regulating smoking bans.

Critics have said the project will promote unwanted activities such as prostitution and will only create 'low level' jobs such as posts for card dealers, waiters and chamber maids.

They argue that what Spain - and especially its young people - needs are high skills roles.
