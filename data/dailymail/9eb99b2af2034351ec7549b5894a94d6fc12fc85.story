Firefighters worked into the night to control a massive blaze that ravaged the iconic boardwalk of Seaside Park, New Jersey starting Thursday afternoon.

Officials said said that 80 per cent of the Seaside Park boardwalk had burned by the time firefighters finally began to win in the struggle against the blaze late Thursday.

The town still reeling from Hurricane Sandy has now been dealt another fearsome blow just a year after the nearby pier became the poster image of the superstorm when its roller coaster was swallowed by the ocean.

The fire broke out near a frozen custard stand in Seaside Park rapidly spread north into neighboring Seaside Heights, the former home of MTV's 'Jersey Shore' reality show.

Inferno: Firefighters are seen pulling back Thursday afternoon during the height of the inferno, which at one point became too hot to approach

Shock: Onlookers watched smoke pour out from the virtually decimated Seaside Park boardwalk. FunTown Pier only last year gained notoriety as the place where Hurricane Sandy caused a roller coaster to be swallowed by the ocean

'The threat of it moving at this point is minimal and
emergency workers did an amazing job,' John Camera, an official at nearby
Seaside Heights, said according to ABC News Radio.

‘The fire appears to be under control,’ Camera said. ‘They'll
be people stationed there probably for another day or more and they expect that
there may be controlled burning.’

With a stiff wind whipping the flames and driving them from block to block, the rest of the iconic boardwalk was in danger of going up in flames.

Seaside Heights officials tried a Hail Mary: they ripped out a 25-foot swath of the boardwalk they had just finished rebuilding five months earlier.

They filled the void with giant sand piles - makeshift dunes designed to halt the spreads of flames and save the northern portion of the boardwalk upon which the community relied for its financial survival.

It worked.

In much the same way as forest fire crews rip out vegetation to deprive an advancing fire of fuel, the boardwalk gambit succeeded in halting the fire's extension any farther into Seaside Heights.

'That appears to have done the trick,' said Seaside Park Mayor Robert Matthies.

Authorities had not officially declared the fire under control shortly before 10 p.m., but firefighters had made significant progress: flames that had leapt 50 feet into the afternoon sky were gone; only small pockets of fire remained to be doused.

'It certainly looks like it's been suppressed,' the mayor said.

Where Seaside Park was largely spared from Sandy's wrath compared to its neighbor, now Seaside Heights is the lucky community.

'It's devastating; I've been crying all afternoon,' said Shirley Kreszl, who has rented a summer home in Seaside Park for decades. 'Haven't we been hit enough? We try to rebuild and just when we think we saved a little bit of our town, this happens. It's just not fair.'

USA Today reports that the fire began at Kohr's Frozen Custard around 2:30pm and quickly began to spread into what’s left of the boardwalk’s FunTown Pier, where Sandy’s wrath saw a roller coaster swallowed by the ocean a year ago.

Hundreds of overwhelmed firefighters from six counties battled the inferno with help from water pumped in from the Barnegat Bay.

Around 20 of the boardwalk's businesses have been decimated, but no injuries have been reported.

However, fire fighters were ordered to pull back for a time because of the extremely intense heat of the blaze in the afternoon.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was on the scene Thursday evening in order to survey the damages
alongside Seaside Park Mayor Robert Matthies, where he officially declared a state of emergency for the town.

The
Republican governor and potential 2016 presidential contender was a 
media staple in the wake of Hurricane Sandy with his frequently 
emotional reactions to the devastated Jersey shoreline.

'I feel like I want to throw up,' said Christie. 'After all the effort and time and resources that we’ve put in to help the folks of Seaside Park and Seaside Heights rebuild…it’s just unthinkable.'

Governor Christie tweeted that approximately 400 firefighters were on the scene.

'For all the people in the area right now, I ask you to stay away from the boardwalk,' he wrote.

Fire fighters struggled to contain the 
blaze that engulfed at least four town blocks by early evening as strong
winds hampered their efforts.

'We’re looking at winds here…anywhere from 20 to 30 miles an hour out of
the south heading north, and that’s our biggest enemy right now are 
these winds,' Christie told NBC.

The fire was still out of control Thursday as the sun set but had slowed somewhat

'It's raging,' said area real estate agent Michael Loundy. 'It is absolutely raging. The wind is blowing something fierce, making it very difficult for firefighters to fight.'

The flames were destroying new boardwalk wood that had just been replaced days before Memorial Day weekend as both towns raced to recover from the devastation of Superstorm Sandy.

Much of the boardwalk had only just been 
replaced ahead of Memorial day weekend and most of the rides on the 
pier, where a roller coaster was famously swallowed by Hurricane Sandy 
last year, had finally reopened.

Residents could do nothing but watch in horror as their town took yet another hit less than a year after Sandy all but destroyed their beach front

'We're going to be here for several days,' one firefighter said as he rushed toward the flames. A line of powerful thunderstorms that battered part of New Jersey swung north of Seaside Park, offering no help to some 400 firefighters battling the flames.

The livelihoods of the two popular Jersey shore resort communities depend on summer tourism and they had just spent millions of dollars rebuilding their boardwalks, arcade games, pizza stands and bar and grills to be ready for the summer season.

'It's a great place to live, and I'm praying the firefighters can get this under control as soon as possible,' said Seaside Park resident Janet Meisner as she watched the flames and smoke rapidly devour the boardwalk.

'We had to deal with Sandy last year and now this happens. We can't catch a break,' she said.

Evacuated: Smoke rises in the distance as firefighters battled a fire raging in Seaside Park. Officials forced some residents out of homes and workers to flee from business that stood within the giant black plume of smoke

Seaside Heights Police Chief Thomas Boyd said a section of boardwalk was being removed to create a fire line to keep the blaze from spreading. He said the fire created embers the size of a fist.

For hours, two boardwalk businesses, an arcade and the popular Saw Mill Cafe, escaped the flames. But shortly before 7 p.m. the arcade was engulfed in a huge orange fireball that rolled into the darkening sky, and flames licked against the side of the Saw Mill; it could not immediately be determined how badly damaged the cafe was.

'I can't believe this is happening,' Koury said as she watched the flames devour boardwalk structures. 'Our small business people went through so much in the storm to get ready for summer and stay open all summer, and now it's all gone. I just can't believe it.'

Officials said the fire got underneath the boardwalk, making it even more difficult to extinguish.

'It's underneath the boards, and its coming up through the cracks,' Koury said. 'It's making it harder to get water on it.'

Matthies said the businesses were primarily wood with tar roofs and shingles, which accelerated the fire.
