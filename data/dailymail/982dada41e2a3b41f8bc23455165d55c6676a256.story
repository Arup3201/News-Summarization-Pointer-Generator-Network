A stricken pensioner who fractured his kneecap after slipping on a wet step was made to wait four hours in the rain before an ambulance arrived to take him to hospital.

Frank Miles, 69, was only kept dry thanks to the kindness of passers by who shielded him from the downpour by fashioning a makeshift shelter with their own umbrellas.

In a desperate bid to find help for the retired civil servant, they dialed 999 six times but were told  there were more important emergencies to tend to - and one operator even hung up to take another call.

Slippery: Rotary club members and hotel workers covered Frank Miles in blankets, propped his head up on a pillow, and supported his leg on a cardboard box, as well as calling 999 SIX TIMES for assistance

Mr Miles, from Magor, South Wales, had slipped on rain-soaked decking as he left a rotary club meeting in nearby Newport, leaving him unable to move for the pain and risk of further damage to his leg.

He was left lying on the floor 
outside the Waterloo Hotel in Pill, Newport, for three hours and 35 
minutes with a fractured left kneecap.

Mr Miles, a retired civil servant, was still in good spirits despite the wait, and said: 'On a very rational basis I think it’s ridiculous that when you injure yourself you have to wait for so long.

'It does feel like a long time but I feel relatively comfortable.'

Rotary club members and hotel workers 
covered him in blankets, propped his head up on a pillow, and supported 
his leg on a cardboard box.

Three hours and 20 minutes after the first emergency call was made, a rapid response vehicle arrived at 5:30pm.

The paramedic apologised to Mr Miles, and fifteen minutes later he was taken to hospital by an ambulance.

Bob Evans, owner of the Waterloo Hotel, said: 'I would have picked him up and taken him in my car but they said it’s too risky. It’s so frustrating that we can’t do anything.'

Dr Malcolm Bright, a former GP, made two of the 999 calls, and was hung-up on the second time after being told a more urgent call needed to be taken.

The first time he called they said that there was no ambulance available.

He said: 'I think the paramedic service is wonderful but this has got to be a terrible system. Something needs to change and something needs to be improved.

'It’s frightening that the ambulance service can’t cope at this time of year.'

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokeswoman said: 'We very much regret the time taken to respond to this call, which was received during a period of high call volume in the area.

'Whilst we cannot discuss individual patient details, we will be looking into this incident, and would encourage the patient or family involved to contact us directly should they wish to discuss their concerns.'
