Manchester United crashed out of the Capital One Cup in a shock second round defeat by MK Dons.

Four errors at the back from Louis van Gaal's makeshift defensive line-up resulted in four goals, two each taken with aplomb by Will Grigg and Benik Afobe, as the League One side enjoyed a superb evening at stadium:mk.

Here, Sportsmail's Matt Barlow gives his verdict on the performance of the players.

Fairytale: Milton Keynes Dons striker Will Grigg celebrates the first in his brace against Manchester United

MK DONS

Martin 6.5 - Rarely called into action but stopped James Wilson's second-half header superbly.

Baldock 6.5 - Put in a decent shift and was always on hand to tidy up, although hardly relied upon.

McFadzean 7 - There to make the important blocks once United started to attack later in the game.

Kay 7 - Showed more determination than any of United's players on Tuesday night.

Lewington 6.5  - A strong display in the MK Dons back-line, and good enough to trend on Twitter...

Alli 7.5 - Tipped to be a thorn in United's side, and showed plenty of spark throughout.

Potter 7.5 - A key player who enjoyed his night in the MK Dons engine room against weak opposition.

Carruthers 6.5 - Looked decent enough before being substituted with half an hour to play.

Reeves 8 - MK Dons' star man who created attacks, set up goals and was a constant threat.

Bowditch 7 - Unlucky to see his second-half shot not earn a penalty for handball before going off.

Grigg 7.5 - The on-loan striker's impressive brace was what got MK en route to their emphatic win.

MANCHESTER UNITED 3-5-2 

De Gea 6 - Conceded four goals against League One opposition and was  frustrated with defence.

M Keane 5 - Probably United's best defender but the youngster shouldn't be too proud of that.

Evans 4.5 - At fault for the opening goal, lucky to not concede a penalty and wasn't captain material.

Vermijl 5 - A spark here and there but nothing that truly worried MK Dons down the left flank.

Janko 5 - Substituted at half time on his United debut and had a tough night at the back.

Anderson 5 - Wanted to impress but failed to do so, and didn't give his best audition for Van Gaal.

Kagawa 4 - Unlucky to be forced off with mild concussion and blurred vision after 20 minutes.

Powell 6 - Arguably United's best player who tried his best in attack but was substituted an hour in.

Before the rot: Shinji Kagawa may consider himself fortunate to have left the field with the score at 0-0

James 5 - Not the best performance from the youngster who struggled on the left for United.

Hernandez 4 - Hardly-ever threatening up top and did very little to make his mark in front of goal.

Welbeck 6 - Had his chances but is unlikely to have convinced Van Gaal he's worthy of a place.
