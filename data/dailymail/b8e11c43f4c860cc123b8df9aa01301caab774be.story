Jose Mourinho relaxed following Chelsea's victory against Liverpool on Saturday with a trip to Wembley to see Dallas Cowboys take on Jacksonville Jaguars in the NFL International Series the following night.

Making up a star-studded capacity crowd on a chilly evening in London, the Chelsea boss - sporting a  scarf - was greeted at pitch-side by Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones before making his way to his seat.

Also in the crowd to see the Cowboys cruise to an easy 31-17 victory was Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Olympic diver Tom Daley, politician George Osbourne, singers Laura Wright, Joss Stone and Eliza Doolittle plus television personalities Spencer Matthews and Lucy Watson.

Wrapped up warm in their winter coats the stars looked on as Dallas sailed to victory over the Jaguars, which was a welcome result after losing their previous two games.

Quarterback Tony Romo threw for 246 yards and three touchdowns against a Jacksonville team who have won just once this season as the Cowboys dominated throughout.

The Cowboys now head into two tough games against division rivals Philadelphia, and the result in London was exactly what they needed.
