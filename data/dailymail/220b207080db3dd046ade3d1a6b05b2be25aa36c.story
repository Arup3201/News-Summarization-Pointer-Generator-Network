Saracens will open their European Rugby Champions Cup campaign by renewing hostilities with Clermont Auvergne, the French side they trounced to reach last term’s Heineken Cup final.

The north London club will help launch an intriguing opening weekend for the inaugural European competition to replace the now-defunct Heineken Cup.

Clermont will be seeking revenge for Saracens’ 46-6 Twickenham hammering in last term’s European semi-final showdown at Twickenham.
