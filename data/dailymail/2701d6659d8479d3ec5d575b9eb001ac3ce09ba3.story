Swansea ended their pre-season with a whimper as they were thumped by Villarreal at the Liberty Stadium. 

The Spanish side took the lead in the third minute through Ikechukwu Uche - and never looked back. 

Bruno Soriano doubled their lead with a fine free-kick after 51 minutes, before on-loan Real Madrid academy player Denis Cheryshev netted a header to make it 3-0.

The vistiors could - and perhaps should - have increased their lead in the closing stages, but Garry Monk's men managed to keep them at bay for the final half hour with some resolute defending, albeit an hour later than when it was really needed.  

Monk admitted his side need to improve greatly to have a chance against Manchester United in their opening Premier League fixture on Saturday. 

‘It needs to be 100 per cent better when we travel to Old Trafford. And it will be,’ he said.
