The pregnant ex-girlfriend of Premiership ace Gabriel Agbonlahor walked free from court today after admitting cyber-stalking his current partner.

Sophie Smith, 25, was handed a suspended sentence after she pleaded guilty to terrorising stunning Elizabeth Wheeler with a four-year campaign of 'harassing' messages sent via e-mail and social networks.

The court heard Smith sent Miss Wheeler degrading and insulting messages which caused the victim 'great upset'.

At Walsall Magistrates' Court today, Miss Smith was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison, suspended for 12 months.

A judge also slapped Smith with a 10-year restraining order which prevents her from going within 200 yards of Miss Wheeler's home.

Sentencing Smith, District Judge 
Michael Morris said: 'You subjected Elizabeth Wheeler to nearly four 
years of insulting, harassing and degrading messages.

'You made false and malicious comments which, at times, incited and caused great upset to Miss Wheeler.

'Your utilisation of Facebook over such a lengthy period of time can only be met by a prison sentence.

'However, in view of your present condition I am going to suspend that prison sentence.'

In addition to paying Miss Wheeler 
£1,000 in compensation, she was also made the subject of a 12-month 
supervision order and made to undertake a 21-day domestic abuse course.

Under
the terms of the order, Smith is also prevented from contacting Miss 
Wheeler through social networks or other electronic means. 

Heavily pregnant Smith was told that if she breaks the terms of the restraining order she could be jailed for up to five years.

As the verdict was read out, Miss Wheeler, who sat in the public gallery with friends, wept.

Michael O'Mahoney, defending, told the court Smith was sorry for what she had done.

He said: 'This is a young lady who is pleasant, she is supportive of her friends and she greatly regrets her actions.

'She accepts that her behaviour went too far.

'There is, unfortunately, no love lost between my client and I believe in the early stages there were exchanges of unpleasantries between them.

'My client now accepts and is apologetic that she carried on the unpleasantries over a long period of time.'

Miss Wheeler and Miss Smith declined to comment outside court.

Gabriel Agbonlahor is a striker for Premiership side Aston Villa. He is a product of their academy and has played for England three times.
