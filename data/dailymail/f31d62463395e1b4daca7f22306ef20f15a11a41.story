Josi
 McLarty was just eight years old when she started to develop agonising 
headaches. Each time she suffered six or so hours of intense pain and 
would often be sick.

'The first time it happened was horrendous,' says Josi's mother, Alma Walker. 'It was terrible seeing her suffer.'

She
 took her to the doctor, who said she had a stomach bug - but the 
problem kept returning, at first every six weeks but eventually once or 
twice a week. Yet during three more visits to the doctor over 18 months,
 Alma was told it was another stomach bug or a virus.

Ten year old Josi Walker from Killin, Stirlingshire suffered from migraines for more than two years

'The doctors just 
kept saying it must be a bug when we knew it wasn't,' says Alma, 47, a 
full-time mother.

It took the arrival of a new GP to notice that 
Josi, now ten, was suffering from migraines. Her mother admits: 'I never
 thought about a child having a migraine.'

Many people believe 
migraines to be mainly an adult condition, but Josi is one of the 10 per
 cent of children who suffer from them. In fact, migraine can even 
strike young babies. The charity Migraine Action says it has had reports
 of infants of four months with symptoms of sudden, short-lived 
paralysis of eye muscles, face or one of the limbs - warning signs of 
the onset of a migraine attack.

For many migraine sufferers, the main
 feature is a thumping headache. Some experience an aura beforehand, 
during which they have visual disturbances, aches in the neck and 
shoulders, sensitivity to light, sound and smells, and a drop in energy.
 Others have no headache but suffer the other symptoms. Most children 
with migraine will have a headache. Around 90 per cent will also feel 
sick and about 60 per cent will actually be sick. Others may complain of
 stomach ache. Only 20â€‰â€‰per cent have auras.

But as children often 
complain of the occasional headache and can be prone to tummy aches, the
 symptoms can be mistaken for something else, such as an allergy or 
sinus problems.

Migraine charities say they often hear of children 
who have suffered for months or even years before getting a correct 
diagnosis.

The vomiting associated with migraines is even mistaken 
for appendicitis, says  Dr Andy Dowson, director of headache services at
 King's College Hospital, London.

'The symptoms may also be mistaken 
for attempts to avoid school. In children the attacks are often about 
four hours long, so by the time they are picked up from school by their 
parents they may be better, and accused of malingering.'

Children's attacks tend to be shorter - hours compared with up to three days for an adult.

What
 causes migraines is not clear. One theory is that low levels of the 
brain chemical serotonin cause blood vessels in the brain to contract 
suddenly and then expand. Sickness is caused by chemical changes during 
an attack stimulating the area of the brain that controls vomiting.The condition also runs in families, so it may be genetic.

Attacks
 can be brought on by all sorts of triggers - some people are sensitive 
to caffeine, others to too much or too little sleep. Stress can also 
make migraine worse, for example, during exam time.Childhood 
migraine expert Dr Ishaq Abu-Arafeh says his patients at the Royal 
Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow can miss up to 80 days of school a
 year.

'In every class at least two or three children will suffer 
with migraine,' he says. 'Some may only have it two or three times a 
year, but others will have it more frequently and it causes a lot of 
problems with their education and social activities.

'Most children with migraine are between the ages of five and 15. The impact on them and their families can be huge.'

Yet there are fewer preventative treatments for children than for adults, as many drugs have not been approved for under-18s.

Two
 drugs tend to be used: pizotifen, to prevent swelling in blood vessels 
in the brain; and propranolol, which acts in a similar way. Paracetamol 
and ibuprofen can help when an attack has started.

Dr Abu-Arafeh 
advises reducing children's intake of caffeine from drinks such as cola 
and not skipping meals, as low blood sugar can cause attacks. He also 
recommends time outside for an hour a day, away from screens. Bright 
light is a common trigger, especially the blue light from iPads, 
computer screens, mobile phones and TVs. 'Once someone has migraine they
 always have it, but as they get older the migraine goes into good and 
bad phases, and the good phases without headaches can last for years,' 
says Dr Abu-Arafeh.

'Often a person's threshold for what triggers a migraine increases, so what caused one when they were younger no longer does.'

Josi's migraines are now better controlled.

She
 was referred to a paediatric neurologist in June 2012 and tried several
 medications including pizotifen, a nasal spray called Imigran, and 
paracetamol. But none had much effect.

'When a migraine was coming 
on, Josi would be very tired and irritable and we often had to cancel 
plans,' says Alma, who lives with her partner Christopher McLarty, 47, a
 school caretaker, and their other daughters Morgan, 16, and Erin, 14, 
in Killin, Perthshire.'She'd often come home from school early with a migraine.'

However,
 her migraine has improved thanks to a less orthodox approach - 
magnesium pills. Migraine sufferers are thought to have lower levels of 
magnesium in the brain during an attack.

One study of 81 adults found
 that taking 600mg of magnesium daily for 12 weeks reduced the number of
 migraine attacks by 42 per cent.

Dr Abu-Arafeh says it helps some 
children with migraine and he often recommends it when other treatments 
have proved ineffective.

'It can be bought over the counter and is safe in the recommended doses,' he says.

Josi has not had a full-blown migraine since November, a month after she started on magnesium. 'The
 pain felt like tiny men trying to thump out of my head,' she says. 'I 
felt very tired and had to miss things my friends and sisters were 
doing. Now I just have a bit of a sore head, which I can cope with.'
