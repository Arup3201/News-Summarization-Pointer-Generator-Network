He is one of the Gaal-acticos now, a constellation of stars Manchester United’s manager must align to bring the glory days back to Old Trafford.

But there have been times in the past eight months when Radamel Falcao feared he might never play at the highest level again.

When Falcao, 28, ruptured the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a French Cup game in January, it soon became clear that the he would miss the Word Cup.

Colombia’s star striker could only watch as his country went out at the quarter-final stage to hosts Brazil in a bruising encounter in Fortaleza. It has not been an easy road to recovery.

However, a week that began with him flying to Manchester on a private jet to tie up a deadline-day move to Louis van Gaal’s United ended with Falcao making his international comeback against the Brazilians in Miami on Friday.

It was only for the last 13 minutes of a 1-0 defeat but this is Falcao after all. The man they call El Tigre. While his team-mates —Real Madrid’s new £71m signing James Rodriguez apart — warranted only passing interest from the waiting media, Falcao emerged from the dressing room at the Sun Life Stadium to an explosion of flashbulbs.

Plenty to smile about: Falcao says he is feeling spectacular and hopes to show he is still at the top level

‘I’m so happy to be back and to have this opportunity life has granted me after the injury,’ he said. ‘I’m excited about being able to join Manchester United. I hope to score a lot of goals for them —that is something I have done everywhere I have played.

‘Because of the injury I felt so nervous before this game, almost like it was my first time with the national team. I expect it will be the same before I play my first game for United.

‘Physically I feel spectacular. I have been able to play without any kind of trouble whatever. Throughout my rehab people have given me so much support and sent me so many kind messages. I want to thank them by giving them as much happiness as possible. As time passes and I get into game shape, I believe I will show I’m still at the top level.’

Falcao’s injury made for a rigorous medical at United’s Carrington training centre on Monday night before his move was confirmed some considerable time after the transfer deadline had passed.

Now he is determined to justify the massive expense they have gone to by bringing him to English football; more than £20million for one season if you factor in his £280,000-a-week ages on top of the £5m loan fee from Monaco.

The transfer fee will be about £51.3m next summer should Van Gaal want to keep Falcao at United alongside Angel di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata.

The former Porto and Atletico Madrid star knows what he is getting into. He understands his new club’s fall from grace and the fact that they have spent £150m this summer trying to put it right.

‘It is a dream come true to play for such a great and famous club,’ he said. ‘To bring the good times back is what we all want and I will work extra hard to do that. United are an historic club, one of the three best clubs in the world. They’ve made me feel very important in this new project and I’m very pleased and happy to have joined them.

‘There has been too much speculation about other clubs but that’s in the past now and I’ve chosen to join Manchester United. Going there was always in my best interests.’

The striker was pictured celebrating with his agent Jorge Mendes and other advisors with a glass of wine in a city centre Chinese restaurant in the early hours of the morning before joining his Colombia team-mates in Miami, where he also applied for a visa at the British Consulate on Thursday.

With everything that had gone on, coach Jose Pekerman chose to name Falcao on the bench after he had been out through an hour-long training session at the team hotel on Friday. It was probably a wise decision considering Colombia and Brazil wasted no time re-opening the hostilities that blighted their World Cup meeting.

With Falcao hoping to make his United debut at home to QPR a week today, Van Gaal will be grateful he was kept out of the firing line for 77 minutes before replacing Rodriguez.

The build-up of excitement that started when he took his place on the bench before kick-off reached a crescendo when the No 9 went up on the board. A couple of final warm-up exercises in front of the dugout and Falcao was back.

It all went a bit flat after that. Neymar claimed Brazil’s winner six minutes later and Falcao’s only notable contribution was to head a close-range chance over the bar.

United fans will expect more for their money when Falcao lands in England today. El Tigre is desperate to deliver.
