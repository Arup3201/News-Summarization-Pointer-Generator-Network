Roma are growing confident of wrapping up the Bosman signing of Glen Johnson in January.

The Liverpool defender is no closer to agreeing terms on a new contract at Anfield and his deal runs out in the summer.

Roma have not been overly impressed with Ashley Cole since his arrival from Chelsea but believe Johnson has more to offer at 30.

Liverpool have been reluctant to improve Johnson's contract as he is already on around £120,000 a week. 

Roma are happy to pay the wages on Bosman transfers and like the idea Johnson has proved he is able to play in both full-back positions and on the right of midfield.

Roma are also continuing to monitor striker Wilfried Bony at Swansea who is yet to agree to a new deal.
