England have been urged by their World Cup-winning captain, Martin Johnson, to put thoughts of next year’s tournament on hold and focus on seizing the ‘Holy Grail’ of victory over New Zealand.

Stuart Lancaster’s England go into Saturday’s QBE series opener against the All Blacks at Twickenham aware that they need to gather powerful momentum before the 2015 showpiece event in this country.

But Johnson — England’s manager during the last, ill-fated World Cup campaign, claimed on Friday that the home side must view Saturday’s Test as a prime target, whatever the longer-term ramifications of the result.

‘These games and the Six Nations stand up in their own right,’ he said. ‘You’re not playing for next year, you’re playing for now. 

‘A win against New Zealand is the proverbial Holy Grail. There are not many players who have that. Playing the All Blacks has a way of focusing the mind.’

Johnson is confident that England can ‘go well’ this Saturday afternoon and if they were to secure a famous victory, he knows from personal experience how that could have a positive, knock-on effect. 

In reference to the win in Wellington in 2003, he said: ‘Dragging a victory out in New Zealand at the end of a long season gave us a big chunk of confidence. It would do the same for England tomorrow (on Saturday). Any victory over the southern hemisphere sides is a confidence boost.’

Assessing the threat posed by New Zealand, Johnson — speaking at 2015 World Cup volunteer ‘try outs’ in Leicester — added: ‘The All Blacks don’t do anything differently, they just don’t let you off the hook if you make an error.’

Richie McCaw, the visitors’ veteran captain, was asked on Friday about the notion that his team and England could find themselves in opposition at next year’s World Cup final.

He said: ‘There is the possibility that, in 12 months’ time, that could be the case.’

The flanker also acknowledged that Saturday’s match is the focal point of the All Blacks’ tour for ‘a number of reasons’, adding: ‘I think back two years and we got tripped up here. Last year was a hell of a match that was in the balance for a fair bit.

‘Because of those memories, it is going to be a hell of challenge tomorrow (on Saturday). Two years ago, we went away for a month off having had a loss — in the end it was by quite a few points.

‘I don’t want to have that sort of summer again so we have to get the job right this week.’
