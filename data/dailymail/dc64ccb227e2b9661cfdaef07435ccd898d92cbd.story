Christopher Samba asked not to play in the second half of the Moscow derby between Dynamo and Torpedo on Monday after being subjected to a torrent of racial abuse.

The former Blackburn and QPR defender, now at Dynamo, did not go out after the interval, with club vice-president Gennady Soloviev saying: 'I can confirm Samba felt offended with Torpedo fans and didn't want to go on the pitch for the second half.

'That's why he was replaced.'

Dynamo defeated their local rivals 3-1, although manager Stanislav Cherchesov had claimed that Samba had been substituted because of a calf injury.

Samba spent six years with Blackburn before moving to the Russian Premier League with Anzhi Makhachkala. 

He returned to England for an unsuccessful loan spell with QPR before signing for Dynamo Moscow last year.

This is not the first time Samba has suffered racist abuse in Russia. In January 2013 while playing for Anzhi a fan threw a banana on the pitch - with Samba responding by throwing it back into the stands.  

The RFU's disciplinary committee will hold a hearing on the latest case on Thursday.

If found guilty, Torpedo face a possible sanction or a ban on playing at their home ground in Ramenskoye, near Moscow.
