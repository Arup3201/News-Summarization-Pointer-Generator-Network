A kayaker out on his afternoon paddle has got the surprise of his life, when he was joined by a very playful family of Humpback whales.

Local Logan Foote was out on the water at Palm Beach, Queensland on Monday afternoon when he had a close encounter with the large animals.

He was was able to capture the incredible footage, when the migrating whale, with its family, breached just metres from where he was sitting in his kayak.

With an underwater camera he was also able to capture their movements below, before paddling slightly closer.

Then he was just able to sit back and watch the show as the whales showed off. 

'I have often seen whales when I am out kayaking, but nothing like this,' he told the Gold Coast Bulletin.

'It is the closest I have been to whales on the Gold Coast and it was a little nerve-racking, there were times he would come close and then dive down under the kayak.'

He shared the amazing footage and a picture of the whale breaching on social media which got some comments like 'wow, amazing' and 'omg awesome'.  

While Logan was able to get close on this encounter, boaties, kayakers and jet skiers are reminded to keep a safe distance from the animals.

Basic rules when near whales is to remain quiet and not to try to feed or touch them while they are in their natural environment.

About Travel says the whale season coincides with winter and spring (June to November) when Humpbacks migrate north from the Antarctic to warmer Australian waters and then head south again.
