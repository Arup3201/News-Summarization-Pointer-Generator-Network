China has been accused by the Philippines of reclaiming land on a reef in disputed islands to build an airstrip just days after Washington described Beijing's actions in the region as 'provocative'.

If confirmed, the airstrip would be the first built by China on any of the eight reefs and islands it occupies in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea.

It would also mark a significant escalation in tensions involving several nations in the area.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, an area rich in energy deposits and an important passageway traversed each year by $5trillion worth of ship-borne goods.

Outrage: Vietnamese and Filipino protesters outside the Chinese Consulate at the financial district of Makati city to protest the recent moves by China to construct an oil rig in disputed waters in the South China Sea

Location: If confirmed, the airstrip would be the first built by China on any of the eight reefs and islands it occupies in the Spratly Islands in the South China Sea

Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the area.

Philippine
 Foreign ministry spokesman Charles Jose told Reuters that China had 
been moving earth and materials to Johnson South Reef, known by the 
Chinese as Chigua, in recent weeks.

He
 said China was reclaiming land in violation of the Declaration on the 
Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, an informal code of conduct 
for the region.

'They're about to build an airstrip,' Jose said.

He said evidence of the Chinese activity on the reef had been shown in aerial photographs taken by the Philippine Navy.

The Philippines and Taiwan already have airstrips in the area.

The
 ministry had already lodged a protest with the Chinese and raised the 
issue behind closed doors at last weekend's summit of the Association of
 South East Asian Nations in Myanmar, Jose said.

Tensions in the South China Sea were already high after China moved a large oil rig into an area also claimed by Vietnam.

Beijing and Hanoi each accused the other of ramming its ships near the disputed Paracel Islands.

It
 came as Vietnam's prime minister sent a text message to millions of 
citizens urging them to act in defense of the country's sovereignty 
following China's deployment of the oil rig, but said that 'bad 
elements' shouldn't be allowed to engage in violence.

The
 message, sent late Thursday and Friday to subscribers via major 
state-owned cellphone operators, didn't directly condemn the riots that 
have broken out this week following China's decision to deploy the rig 
off the coast of central Vietnam on May 1.

Vietnamese patrol ships sent to disrupt the rig are currently locked in a tense standoff with Chinese ships guarding it.

Anti-China protests that started 
peacefully have ended in violence and vandalism, with 400 factories 
suspected of having links with China destroyed or damaged by mobs.

One Chinese worker was killed and scores more injured at a huge Taiwanese steel mill that was overrun by a 1,000-strong crowd.

'The
 prime minister requests and calls on every Vietnamese to boost their 
patriotism to defend the fatherland's sacred sovereignty with actions in
 line with the law,' the text message said.

'Bad elements should not be allowed to instigate extremist actions that harm the interests and image of the country.'

There were no reports of any new violence or protests on Friday.

Vietnam's authoritarian leaders typically clamp down on public protests of any sort, but have allowed them this time.

Preventing people from demonstrating would have given fuel to domestic critics of the government who already accuse it of being soft on Beijing.

The government is also able to use the nationalist sentiment of its people to amplify its protests to Beijing.

But violence that harms foreign investment and risks spinning out of control is unlikely to fit into this strategy, and the government will attempt to ensure that it doesn't break out again, most analysts say.

China and Vietnam have tussled for years over competing territorial claims, as have the Philippines and China.

But Beijing's desire for oil and gas, and its growing economic and military might, have seen it take an increasingly assertive stance to its claims in the sea, triggering increased tensions and incidents between it and claimant states.

The anti-China violence on the streets is only inflaming the relationship further.

China said its foreign minister, Wang Yi, called Vietnamese Foreign Minister Pham Binh Minh on Thursday and expressed Beijing's 'strong condemnation and stern protest' over the violence against Chinese and other foreign nationals and businesses.

The U.S. doesn't take a side in the disputes, but shares many of the concerns of Vietnam and the Philippines about China.

On Tuesday, Kerry said during a phone call with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi that China's introduction of the oil rig and numerous government vessels into the area disputed with Vietnam was 'provocative', a State Department spokeswoman confirmed.
