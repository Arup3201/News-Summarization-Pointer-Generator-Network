A potentially historic Nor’easter is churning its way toward the Northeast with potential hurricane force wind gusts and blizzard conditions dumping as much as two feet of snow in some places on Friday and Saturday.

While the actual trajectory for the storm is still unknown, New York City could get around 10 inches and Boston could get slammed with as much as two feet with winds gusts up to 55 mph.

A blizzard watch is now in effect starting Friday morning for much of Eastern Massachusetts and Rhode Island with travel not recommended amid fears of dangerous white out conditions, the National Weather Service reports.

The National Weather Service is forecasting 'a potential historic winter storm and blizzard' in Boston while issuing a blizzard watch throughout the area from Friday until Saturday afternoon.

They
 report the heaviest snow to begin falling on Friday night into Saturday morning 
with 2-3 inches per hour possible and visibility less than a quarter of a
 mile or less at times.

Just south, most of New York state is under its own winter storm watch with snow likely to begin falling by early Friday morning and develop into heavier snowfall 
throughout the afternoon.

Heavy rain, snow, and wind gusts possibly more than 50 mph are 
expected throughout Metro New York, Long Island, Connecticut and up into 
Orange county, New Jersey creating fears of 
potential power outages in freezing conditions and drifting and blowing snow making roads 
impassable according to NOAA.

'As always in the winter season we are prepared for whatever Mother Nature brings,' New York Sanitation Dept. spokesman Keith Mellis told the New York Post of their 365 salt-spreaders standing by.

'Once we get a weather forecast that looks like the threat of snow, we have them pre-loaded. They’re our first line of defense,' he said.

Widespread minor flooding and 
moderate flooding along shoreline communities is also expected, 
potentially causing moderate to significant beach erosion among some of 
the hardest hit areas less than four months after Hurricane Sandy.

The Weather Channel reports that the Midwestern storm pattern, which passed through Chicago and Milwaukee, will mix with wetter weather coming from New Orleans, Louisville, and even Atlanta.

By Thursday night, forecasts predict that the clipper system will travel from the Great Lakes region to the East Coast, passing through Philadelphia, New York, and up towards Boston.

Buffalo and Albany are also under the threat of significant snowfall, according to the NOAA.

But other weather forecasters say that there will be little accumulation in New York and Philadelphia, instead forecasting rain and sleet.

The contrasting situation of monstrous proportions - causing some to estimate seeing 38-inches of snow dumped on New york City - rests on the interaction between a small weather system near Chicago and another off the Carolina coast that has yet to form, the WSJ reports.

If the two storms merge the massive snow fall is expected to pound the full northeast area.

If it misses one another - even by 50 miles - the storm would be expected to shift its weight further north, sparing New York City instead with rain and light snow.

'Crunching all that data together inside my little weather brain, I haven’t seen anything that argues convincingly for more than six inches of snow in the five boroughs,' WSJ's Eric Holthaus reports.

'The National Weather Service agrees,' he continues, 'although totals could quickly increase further northward into Connecticut. More likely, the city will get two to five inches of slush mixed with rain.'

Philadelphia is also expected to be hit with 2-4-inches of snow,
 beginning overnight on Thursday and continuing into Friday, with rain in 
the southern areas of the region.

Around Mount Holly, New Jersey, gusts are expected up to 55 mph at the Shore and 40 mph inland.

Washington, D.C., which has seen little snowfall this season, will likely get rain.

New York City has been largely spared its usual snowfall, which averages at around 25 inches as of February.

This year, there has been less than eight inches of snowfall in the city. Last year, too, proved to be a dry winter for New Yorkers, with a similar average accumulation.

Similarly Boston has only had 9.6 inches since December 1, putting it 14.3 inches below normal.

Earlier this year, much of the country was hit with a vicious cold snap, with punishing winds and Arctic temperatures causing temperatures to plummet well below freezing.
