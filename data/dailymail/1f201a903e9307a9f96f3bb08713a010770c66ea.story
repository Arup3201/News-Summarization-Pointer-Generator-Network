Simon Crutchley, 51, from Tewkesbury, swindled more than £40,000 from his 90-year-old mother so he could pay back his spiralling debts

A son stole £40,000 from his 'extremely vulnerable' elderly mother so he could pay back his spiralling debts - just months after the pair were reconciled for the first time in twelve years.

Simon Crutchley, 51, from Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, swindled the money from 90-year-old Joan - who is almost completely deaf - by pretending he was looking after her finances.

His mother, who had been estranged from Crutchley since 1998, had contacted her son in 2010 because she was ill.

But months after being reconciled, Crutchley took control over his mother’s finances - so he could steal £42,700 from her life savings.

The self-employed salesman - who had racked up a £90,000 credit card bill and a £40,000 loan - withdrew the money four times over a 15-month period.

He ripped up his mother's bank statements and ordered her carers not to touch her post so he could cover his tracks.

Crutchley was jailed for 16 months after pleading guilty to four counts of theft during a hearing at Wolverhampton Crown Court.

Judge Martin Walsh said: 'She was extremely vulnerable. These offences are so serious they cross the custody threshold.

'These offences took place over a period of 15 months and you stole more than £42,700 from your aged mother.'

The court heard that Crutchley stole the money four times from his mother's HSBC account and cash ISAs between 2011 and 2013.

He stole the money in instalments of £19,000, £15,717, £6,497 and £1,538.

As well as a credit card debt and a loan, Crutchley also had a £390,000 mortgage which he struggled to pay off after losing his job.

Prosecutor Trevor Meegan told the court: 'This money was essentially Mrs Crutchley’s life savings which she was using to pay for her car and she wanted to stay in her own home.

'When interviewed, Crutchley originally said after he had lost his job his mother had told him to take what money he needed and there had never been any discussion of paying it back.'

The court heard that despite the theft, Mrs Crutchley still had enough money to be able to live in her own home.

Blondelle Thompson, defending, said: 'He lost his job and his outgoings exceeded his income.

'He took advantage of her and is ashamed of the way he behaved.'
