A morbidly obese rapist who crushed his victims under the weight of his hulking 23-stone body has been jailed for eight years.

Noureldin Derwish threatened to kill the families of his victims - one a 17-year-old girl - if they didn't have sex with him, a court in Melbourne, Australia, heard.

A jury found the 27-year-old guilty of 13 counts of rape, three counts of making threats to kill and two counts of false imprisonment, News.au reported.Â 

The County Court in Victoria (pictured) heard Noureldin Derwish threatened to kill the families of his victims - one a 17-year-old girl - if they didn't have sex with him

The court heard how he convinced his 
victims that he was an international drug lord who knew where former Al Qaida leader Osama bin 
Laden lived through his criminal connections.

Derwish
 lured one victim into his trap by telling her that unless she met him 
for sex he would use his Egyptian mafia connections to hunt her down.

He took her to a hotel in Melbourne's eastern suburbs where he handcuffed her to a bed for seven hours while he raped her.

The young girl had been waiting for her 
sister at a station in September 2010 when Derwish, who called himself 
Ali, approached her and offered her drugs in exchange for sexual 
favours.

The victim, who had grown increasingly fearful of Derwish, agreed to meet him again some days later, News.au reported.

He
 had threatened to find her family and kill them if she told police, and
 again reminded her of his links to the Egyptian mafia.

Derwish met his second victim, who was 23, in June 2011.

After she rejected a false job offer at one of his strip clubs, he offered her a job working for his fictitious company.

While
 negotiating details of the fake job, the victim repeatedly turned down 
requests to sleep with Derwish, including an offer of $3 million.

Derwish
 later told his victim that he had not wanted to sleep with her, but was
 testing her to see if she was a suitable candidate for the job at the 
company.

After the victim 
grew impatient with waiting to start her new job, Derwish, who went by 
the name Fernando, started to become aggressive.

He told her he was an international cocaine importer and threatened to kill her entire family while making her watch.

He also told the victim that his cousin was looking for a sex slave and had his eyes on her sister.

He forced the woman to have unprotected sex on a string of occasions and to make two sex videos.

The
 judge said that while Derwish was mentally impaired there was 
meticulous planning involved in creating the web of lies necessary to 
lure his victims.

He received a non-parole period of eight years and was placed on the sex offenders' registry for life.
