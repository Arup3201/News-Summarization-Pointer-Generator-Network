Coffee shops famous for selling cannabis in the Netherlands will be forced to remove some types of the drug from their stores  after new restrictions are brought in.

Due to higher potency levels, the Dutch government is reclassifying some strains of the plant to the same category as hard drugs.

Dutch politicians say the more popular high-strength cannabis, known as 'skunk', is more dangerous than it was before and will have to be removed from coffee-shop shelves.

Blow: Coffee shop owners famous for selling cannabis will have to replace about 80% of their stock with weaker varieties due to new restrictions

It is claimed that the amount of the 
main active chemical in cannabis THC, has gone up, making it far more 
potent than a generation ago.

The new restrictions will mean that 
anything containing more than 15% THC will be treated the same way as 
hard drugs, such as cocaine and ecstasy.

Soon to be banned: High strength 'Skunk'' will be banned in the Netherlands from next year

The news has come as a blow to the 
coffee shop owners as they will have to replace about 80% of their stock
with weaker varieties. 

Marc
Josemans, who runs a cafe in Maastricht, told the BBC that he believes 
that the new tough approach is being driven by the increasingly 
influential far-right in Dutch politics.

He said: 'You immediately can taste the difference. Everything which is considered unusual for them - they call it 'left hobbies' and under this name they want to ban all 'left hobbies', like using cannabis,'

The ban on the high-strength 'skunk' is expected to be introduced next year, when police will start doing random checks in the cafes.

From next year, the Dutch government also plans to ban tourists from entering coffee shops across the country.
