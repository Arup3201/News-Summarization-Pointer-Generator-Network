Amy Childs has stripped down to her lingerie for a new beauty campaign and shows no sign of festive overindulgence.

The former TOWIE star has been shaping up for her photoshoot and shares her health and beauty secrets with FEMAIL.

Speaking about her fitness regime, Amy, 24, said: 'I found it really difficult in December because there was so much excitement around Christmas and I was so busy that it was hard to fit exercise into my schedule but now it is the New Year I shall be back in the gym three to four times a week.'

The svelte star complements her fitness regime with a well-balanced diet - but she does allow herself the occasional treat, too. 

'I don’t really have a strict eating regime as different jobs means different eating patterns,' she said.

'Between Monday and Friday I try to be really healthy by eating salad and high protein foods. I also try to drinks lots of water to keep my skin hydrated.

'I must admit, though, every morning I have to have a cup of tea with one big sugar to get me ready for the day. 

'Obviously over the week I do like to indulge in some less healthy bits and like a glass of wine on a Saturday night.'

Despite showcasing an enviably honed physique in the campaign shots, modest Amy reveals that she admires another star's body.

'I love Michelle Keegan’s body,' she said. 'She is very toned and has a great figure.'

Amy is the face of Silk'n Glide - a new at home device that claims to provide permanent hair removal.

Speaking about her latest gig, she said: 'This campaign is perfect for me, especially with my connection to beauty and I am absolutely loving it!'

Although she runs her own beauty salons across the UK, Amy admits that she doesn't have to visit them anymore thanks to her favourite new device.

Amy, shot by Dan Kennedy for the campaign, admits that she's often so busy that she struggles to fit exercise into her schedule but now it is the New Year, she will be hitting the gym three to four times a week

She said: 'It’s amazing because it means that you don’t have to always go to the salon anymore, you don’t have to use an epilator or waxing and the effects are permanent.

'It’s a great hand-held device which you can just pop in your bag and is so quick and easy and simple to use. It’s fab!' 

Thanks to her expertise as a beautician, the reality TV star loves trying out a number of treatments and recently tested out liposuction to boost her confidence. 

Speaking about the treatment, she said: 'I have tried and loved lipo - it was great for me and really made me feel good in my body.' 

Amy, who made a name for herself on The Only Way Is Essex, is already a millionaire but she's not going to be putting her feet up anytime soon.

'I am absolutely loving what I’m doing at the moment', she said of her glittering career.

'In the future I would love to open more salons and also continue to expand my clothing collection but for now it’s just about enjoying what I'm doing and making the most of it.' 

Amy, who made a name for herself on The Only Way Is Essex, has come a long way since landing a role on the show in 2011 and admitted she loves Michelle Keegan's body, right
