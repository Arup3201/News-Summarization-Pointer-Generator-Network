Nearly a dozen members of the same Alabama family – including the mother and brother of a missing teen - have been arrested on sex abuse charges.

The arrests are linked to missing mother-of-one Brittney Wood, 19, who hasn’t been seen since she left her Theodore home, just outside Mobile, to visit her uncle, Donnie Holland, in the Styx River area, on Thursday May 31, 2012.

She was last seen in a car with Holland at Tillman's Corner. Two days later he committed suicide using a gun which Brittney owned.

Since then 11 people, either members of the Wood family, or with direct links to it, have been arrested on charges including rape, sex abuse with children under 12, incest and sodomy.

The suspects in the sex ring include Brittney’s mother, Chessie Wood, her brother, Derek Wood, Nelton ‘Butch’ Morgan, Dustin Kent, William ‘Billy’ Brownlee, Mendy Kent, Wendy Holland, James Cumbaa, Randall Scott Wood and Jennifer Moore, the most recent arrest.

Detectives believe that Brittney may have gone to visit her uncle to confront him about sex abuse and have voiced their frustration that the one person who may be able to shed light on the alleged crimes has disappeared.

Detective Eric Winberg told Fox 10 news in April 2013: ‘We often (sic) times look for that golden nugget. That one person that can make the difference in your case.

Accused: Brittney's mother, Chessie Wood, is charged with two counts of sodomy and sex abuse of a child less than 12

Suspects: Randall Wood (left), who's been charged with second degree sodomy, enticing a child to enter and second degree rape, and Brittney Wood's brother, Derek Wood (right), who's been charged with second degree rape and second degree sodomy

‘In this particular case, Brittney Wood was that person. She was the person that could tell the whole story.’

Police were investigating the abuse before Brittney's disappearance.

Detectives say Brittney exchanged messages on Facebook on May 27, 2012, with one of the alleged victims, in which abuse was discussed.

After Brittney asked ‘how are you? 
Tell me what's going on. I don't know what's true and what you said’, 
the victim claimed to have been raped by Randall Scott Wood, Dustin 
Kent, and Donald Holland.

‘I love you, I’m sorry,’ Brittney replied.

The alleged victim wrote more messages to Brittney on May 28 and May 30, but did not receive a reply.

In October 2012 a police detective testified in the case against Dustin Kent.

The court heard that Kent raped a relative at the age of 13 in 2008 while her father watched.

According
 to the detective, the father took the young girl out in his truck 
claiming they were going to buy a hamster from a pet store.

Instead they picked up Kent and drove to an industrial park.

When the car pulled over, Kent took off her clothes and performed a sex act on her before raping her as her father watched, Sgt. Scott Congleton testified.

'She kept telling him to stop. He did not,' the detective said.

According to AL.com there are at least four victims of alleged abuse. Officers claim some of the victims were under the age of 12 when the attacks took place and are related to those arrested.

Lead prosecutor Mobile County Assistant District Attorney Nicki Patterson told the website that suspected victims have been placed in foster care where necessary.

'This is a more layered group than we have seen or uncovered here in Mobile,' Patterson said.

'Family members sharing their children, unfortunately, is not new. It is not that unusual from what we know.'

'If you’re getting to a third generation and people are still choosing to abuse, sometimes these networks take place'

'Everybody's main interest here is to protect these kids and do the best job that we can.'

'Most of these children are no longer with their immediate family members. They are either in foster care or with extended family.'

Speaking to WKRG.com, she added: 'Pretty much everyone in this extended family was having sex with one another and having sex with the children",

Det. Terri Hall of the Mobile County Sheriff's Office said:  'For just your everyday person, you just can't understand how a family operates the way they operate. You just can't. I can't even think of a word to describe this family.'

Chessie Wood has accused her deceased brother-in-law of killing Brittney.

She maintains her innocence on the sex abuse charges she faces.

The accused are currently awaiting trial.
