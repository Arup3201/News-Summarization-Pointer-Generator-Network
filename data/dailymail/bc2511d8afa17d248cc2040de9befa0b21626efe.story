Two teenagers have been arrested on suspicion of terror offences after police raids on homes in Greater Manchester.

The 16-year-olds, one a boy and one a girl, were arrested in Mossley yesterday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism.

Officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU) are still searching two homes in the surrounding area while the suspects remain in custody.

Officers are searching two homes in Mossley, Greater Manchester after two teenagers were arrested on suspicion of terror offences

The boy and girl were arrested at their homes (pictured left and right) yesterday following police raid 

The current searches, carried out by officers from the North West Counter Terrorism Unit (NWCTU), are expected to take some time

Police say the searches could take some time and that residents should expect 'a lot of police activity'.

A police van was parked outside a terraced house today on one of the streets where an arrest took place, while a smaller Tactical Aid Unit van parked opposite. The curtains at the front of the house were closed.

But they say there is no evidence of 'any sort international terrorist plot' and also assured the local community that they were not at risk.

One neighbour on one of the streets, who did not wish to be named, said the family living at the address were not Muslim.

He said: 'The mum and dad that live there I don't know too well.

'The daughter is a tearaway.I knew something was going on by all the flashing lights but no one had told us it was anything to do with terrorism, the police seemed to be here all day.' 

Greater Manchester Police said the arrests would cause 'a certain amount of anxiety' but that there is no threat to the Mossley community 

Geoff Hobson, manager of the nearby Tollemache Arms, said: 'There were police going round here all day.

A 29-year-old man from Stoke-on-Trent has been arrested this morning on suspicion of posting comments online about the Islamic State.

West Midlands police said the man had been arrested at his home on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting a proscribed organisation.

They said the arrest was 'pre-planned and intelligence led' but that action was not taken because of any immediate risk to public safety. His arrest was not connected to the police activity in Manchester, they added. 

'We had no idea what was going on but it must have been something serious because it was manic here.

'There were loads of police cars here all through the day until around 5pm and then it quietened down a bit.

'There's still a police presence here now so everyone's on edge because they don't know what's happened. It's all very dramatic for this area - it's usually a very quiet place.'

Chief Superintendent Caroline Ball, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'I know news of an arrest made under terrorism legislation in this community will cause a certain amount of anxiety and people will understandably have questions.

'What I want to stress very clearly is that this investigation is in no way linked to any sort of international terrorist plot nor have we recovered any evidence to suggest the community of Mossley is at risk. 

'This investigation has arisen as a result of information from law enforcement agencies so it is prudent we act on that information and carry out a thorough, professional investigation to determine the circumstances and details of the activity reported.'

She added: 'Members of our community will see a lot of police activity at these addresses over the coming days but rather than cause anxiety I want people to be reassured that we have taken this precautionary action to ensure the safety of our residents.

'Again I would stress there is no current threat to either the Mossley community or wider and there is no reason to be unduly worried.'
