Twinkling city lights, raging wildfires and colorful auroras are lit up in new dazzling nighttime views of the Earth.

The new images released Wednesday are courtesy of a newly-launched NASA-NOAA satellite that's equipped with a sensor to observe the planet at night.

The satellite, Suomi NPP, was launched on October 28, 2011.

What's up with the north? The Korean Peninsula is seen at night from a composite assembled from data acquired by the Suomi NPP satellite. Where South Korea is gleaming with city lights, North Korea has hardly any lights at all

Illuminated: Lights across the earth are pictured in this NASA handout satellite image

There's the Nile River bathed in city lights. A map of the United States shows the populated East Coast illuminated.

Light from fishing boats can also be pinpointed.

'For all the reasons that we need to 
see Earth during the day, we also need to see Earth at night,' Steve 
Miller, a researcher at NOAA's Colorado State University Cooperative 
Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, said in a NASA statement. 'Unlike humans, the Earth never sleeps.'

Miller added: 'It's like having three simultaneous 
low-light cameras operating at once and we pick the best of various 
cameras, depending on where we're looking in the scene.'Â

'The instrument can capture images on
nights with or without moonlight, producing crisp views of Earth's 
atmosphere, land and ocean surfaces.

The satellite also captured the glow from natural sources including moonlight, northern lights and naturally-occurring fires.

After Superstorm Sandy made landfall in late October, hard-hit New Jersey, lower Manhattan and the Rockaways appeared dark in the satellite images compared with surrounding areas - the result of widespread power outages that plagued the region for days and weeks following the storm.

Mitch Goldberg, program scientist for NOAA's Joint Polar Satellite System, said: 'NOAA's National Weather Service is continuing to explore the use of the day-night band. The very high resolution from VIIRS data will take forecasting weather events at night to a much higher level.'
