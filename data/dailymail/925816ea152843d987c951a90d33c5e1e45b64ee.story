Seduced a schoolboy: Rachel Peters, 40, became Facebook friends with the teenager before having sex with him and sending sexual messages online

A ‘predatory’ teaching assistant who seduced a schoolboy of 13 and had sex with him in a field was jailed for three years and three months yesterday.

Rachel Peters, 40, targeted the teenager despite being given a warning the previous year for inappropriate conduct with another pupil and having a daughter of a similar age.

A respected member of staff at the school, Peters broke the rules by speaking to pupils over the internet on Facebook and MSN instant messaging service, Doncaster Crown Court was told.

After initially refusing to become the 13-year-old’s Facebook friend, the pair began exchanging emails.

Prosecuting, Kath Goddard said: ‘It involved discussion of sexual matters.’

When talking to the teenager over a webcam one evening, Peters pulled open her dressing gown to expose her breasts to him.

A few days later she picked him up from school and ‘made it clear she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him,’ Miss Goddard said.

They drove to a rural area where she performed a sex act on him in the car and she then took him to a field where they had sex, the court was told.

The pair continued to meet outside school in the evenings and send sexual messages over the internet.

The boy told police he ended the relationship after becoming worried when Peters started talking about running away together the court heard.

Their affair came to light following a school trip when the boy was overheard chatting to a friend and admitted to a member of staff he had sex with ‘somebody called Rachel’. The school called in the police in September 2010 and Peters was arrested.

Peters lied to police, claiming she was trying to help the boy because he was being bullied at school and had not had sex with him.

But detectives found a large number 
of texts and incriminating messages on her computer between her and the 
boy, as well as a boy aged 17.

Peters,
of Edlington, Doncaster, was due to stand trial on 10 offences but 
after a jury had been sworn in she changed her plea to guilty on three 
offences.

She was convicted
of engaging in sexual activity in the boy’s presence and two charges of
causing or inciting the boy to engage in sexual activity.

All three offences took place between January and September 2010.

The other offences were left to lie on the file. Peters was also placed on the Sex Offenders Register.

Passing
sentence, Judge Jacqueline Davies said Peters had tried to gain the 
boy’s sympathy by lying to him and claiming that her former partner was 
terminally ill. It is not clear whether or not Peters is still with her 
partner.

Reports concluded she posed a serious risk to teenage boys and her behaviour was ‘predatory’.

The judge told her: ‘As a mother of a daughter of a similar age I would hope you would appreciate the wrongness of this offence.

‘You were not naive, you have been a teaching assistant for 17 years and have been reprimanded for your conduct in the past.’

Steven Crossley, defending, said Peters had expressed ‘genuine contrition and remorse.’
