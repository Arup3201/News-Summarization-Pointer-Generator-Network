Controversy: Shaun Donovan, who is in charge of long-term Sandy recovery, said it may not be worth rebuilding all areas destroyed by Sandy

The man appointed by President Obama to be in charge of helping the rebuilding process following Superstorm Sandy has sparked outrage by saying some areas may not be worth rebuilding at all. 

Housing and urban development secretary Shaun Donovan said in a news conference Thursday that while many communities will be rebuilt with additional safety precautions, he said that a ‘very small share’ of homes ‘may not make sense to rebuild at all.’

When the massive storm struck on October 29, it destroyed thousands of homes and cost billions of dollars in damage.

Donovan, who is running the long-term relief effort following the storm, said Thursday that it didn’t make sense for certain areas destroyed by Sandy to rebuild. 

‘It may be as small as a block or a couple of blocks, but that is something we have to think about,’ he said, according to television station NY1.

He said that in many cases, it was easiest to rebuild homes with more safety features, including elevating homes and pulling them back from the shore.

Donovan also said that sea barriers and other blockades need to be considered to protect the low-lying areas of the city.

In the days following the storm, President Obama asked Congress to approve $60.4billion to go to federal Sandy relief.

Also on Thursday, the governors of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut issued a powerful plea to Congress to act immediately on their decision to provide aid for states battered by Sandy.

Joining the effort were more than 125 prominent CEOs based in New York who also urged Congress to quickly pass a $60billion aid package.

Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Andrew Cuomo of New York and Dannel Malloy of Connecticut said no region or state should have to stand alone after a disaster.

They wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that Congress hasn't acted in seven weeks following Sandy, taking longer to provide aid than in previous disasters such as Hurricane Katrina.

'Storms and disasters lay waste to communities and deliver damage far beyond the resources and capacity of any single state to recover on its own,' wrote Cuomo and Malloy, both Democrats, and Christie, a Republican. 'This is why Congress has always come to the assistance of Americans facing a recovery effort of this scale.'

They wrote: 'Americans come together in times of crisis. Our states have stood with your communities when they suffered and faced devastation. It's time for Congress to stand with us.'

The CEOS backing the aid include top executives of Time Warner, NBC Universal, Bloomberg, Morgan Stanley, Madison Square Garden and the National Basketball Association. Many of the companies are major media outlets and campaign contributors.

'Americans come together in times of 
crisis. Our states have stood with your communities when they suffered 
and faced devastation. It's time for Congress to stand with us.'

'This region is the most critical platform for American business and the largest contributor to federal tax revenues,' the CEOs wrote in a letter to congressional leaders sent by The Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group.

'We believe that failure to expeditiously fund storm relief and recovery will severely weaken this region and worsen our nation's overall fiscal condition.'

President Barack Obama a week ago proposed $60.4billion for the states, about three-quarters of what they requested.

Now it's in the hands of Congress, which is already in a budget battle to cut spending by January 1.

Rep. Peter King, R-New York, is pushing the aid request in the Republican House and told The Associated Press in an interview that the high-stakes budget negotiations already under way when Sandy hit made the requests more challenging.

'I'm still reasonably confident we can do this, but it is a concern,' King said. 'But the governors raise a good wake-up call.'

Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said the aid package should be a bipartisan priority.

'Before we leave this year, we must act to provide emergency disaster aid to fund the response to Superstorm Sandy,' Schumer said at a news conference of Senate leaders Thursday, a day after a televised fundraising concert.

'Last night, 2billion people around the world tuned into a benefit concert to help raise money for the Sandy relief efforts.'

The governors said their states' legislators had supported aid after previous disasters.

'They did so in the spirit of compassion, recognizing that in times of crisis no region, state or single American should have to stand alone or be left to fend for themselves,' they wrote.
