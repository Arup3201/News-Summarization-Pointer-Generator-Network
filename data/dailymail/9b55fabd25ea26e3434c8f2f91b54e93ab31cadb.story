Charges against an Illinois man who confessed to a 2008 hit-and-run accident that took the life of a 20-year-old college student were dropped on Thursday after prosecutors determined that his dramatic confession to the victim's family several years after the tragic crash was false.

Defense experts working on the case found that 29-year-old David McCarthy, the man who confessed to hitting University of Illinois sophomore Melissa Lech with his car is suffering from a mental illness that caused him to confess to the crime.

Last week, a state psychologist working on behalf of the Will County State's Attorney's Office agreed with the defense expert that McCarthy suffers from delusional disorder and has a history of bipolar 
disorder and alcohol dependence.

The state psychologist also concluded that his confession was a product of his 
mental disorder, court records obtained by the Chicago Tribune.

Lech was walking in the 2800 block of McDonough Street in Joliet after spending the day drinking at a Chicago White Sox baseball game.

After the game, Lech was denied admittance to a local bar because she was underage. When she left the bar, she was hit while walking back towards her house.

The case went unsolved until 2012, when McCarthy showed up at the doorstep of Lech's sister Melissa and confessed to being the driver who hit her sister.

'He sat across from me,' Melissa Lech said at the time. 'He was calm and said, "I was the one who hit your sister.'

'Toward
 the end, I was saying, "Well, are you going to come to the police now? 
Are you going to come forward?'" she recalled. 'And he was like, "I 
have to think about it.' And I said, "OK." And he said, "I think I 
should go.'"

According to Michelle Lech, McCarthy explained that he got lost trying to get on Interstate 55. He claims he didn't see Melissa Lech walking on the road and he hit her accidentally before driving off. She says he told her that he saw her head hit the windshield before he drove over her body.

Michelle Lech says McCarthy never once asked for forgiveness. 

McCarthy was arrested at his family's home a few hours later. He's been sitting in jail awaiting trial ever since.

The victim's mother, Maria Lech, says she still believes McCarthy is the person who hit her daughter. She says he knew details of the crash that only the person who hit her could possibly know. 

Lech says that McCarthy talked about her daughter's injuries when he confessed to Michelle Lech, and that he talked about how he held her shoulder to try and limit the bleeding. According to Lech, McCarthy also said her daughter asked him to tell her mother than she loved her.

During his confession to the family, McCarthy talked about injuries to 
her daughter’s head and that he held her shoulder to limit the bleeding.
 He also said Melissa Lech told him to tell her mother she loved her.

Prosecutors, however, say there is no physical evidence linking McCarthy to the hit-and-run.

Investigators found a paint chip on the victim that was similar to paint used on a vehicle owned by McCarthy's family at the time of Lech's death. Forensic testing, however, found that the paint was not a match to the car.
