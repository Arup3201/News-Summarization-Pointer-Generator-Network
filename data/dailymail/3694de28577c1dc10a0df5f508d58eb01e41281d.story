Tottenham players swapped football for basketball as they took on the members of the United States side in an NBA half-court challenge.

Roberto Soldado, Etienne Capoue, Brad Friedel and Jordan Archer represented Spurs and faced Brad Guzan, Geoff Cameron, DaMarcus Beasley and Alejandro Bedoya at their training base in Enfield. 

All players had five attempts each from the half-court distance, and it was the American players who led the way.

Aston Villa goalkeeper Guzan said he would choose both Peter Crouch and Lionel Messi in his fantasy basketball team made up of football players alongside himself.

'I’d definitely put Peter Crouch on to play in the middle,' Guzan said before adding 'I’d have Messi running the point guard.
