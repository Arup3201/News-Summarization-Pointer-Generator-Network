Quality comes at a price, but not as much as you’d think. The Sennheiser Momentum family represent the Rolls Royce of headphones – blending state-of-the-art design and materials with cutting-edge sound. And these new over-ear headphones are no different.

Injecting vibrant blue, pink, green and cream colours into Sennheiser’s range of headphones, these latest Momentums use a high-performance transducer system that offers uncompromising rich and detailed sound performance with their trademark emphasis on bass.

Sound investment: The Momentums are built to last

Pitches are incredibly crisp while 
still allowing vocals to slice through them easily. Basses aren’t as 
aggressive as the Momentum’s closest rival, Beats Executives, choosing 
subtle grows over ear-deafening power.

As
 a result, bass-heavy music genres – such as drum and bass – don’t do 
the Momentums justice. Classical music, on the other hand – so oft the 
hardest genre to fully capture – is a breeze for them.

Audio is helped along by specially 
designed earpads made from high-tech Alcantara – a  luxury 
material loved by yacht and automotive upholsterers for its durability, 
comfort and softness.

Still, you may want to give your ears a breather 
after an hour of non-stop listening.

Lightweight
 sliders of premium brushed stainless steel complete the high-end look 
and a single sided detachable cable with in-line remote and mic for 
Apple iDevices means easy control for music, making and receiving calls.

The Momentum On-Ears are available from John Lewis or via Sennheiser’s online store now.
