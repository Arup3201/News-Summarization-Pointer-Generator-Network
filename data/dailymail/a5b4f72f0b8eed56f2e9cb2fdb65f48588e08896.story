A seven-year-old boy has been electrocuted while swimming in his family's pool, apparently due to a faulty light beneath the water.

Calder Sloan was racing his nanny's adult son across the backyard pool in Miami, Florida on Sunday when the man felt a shock in the water, leaped out and yelled for the boy to get out too.

But Calder, who was underwater and couldn't hear him, suddenly received a massive jolt that threw him out of the water.

Neighbors rushed to the home and performed CPR on the boy before paramedics arrived.

Loss: Calder Sloan, 7, has died after he was electrocuted while swimming in his family's pool on Sunday

Neighbor Fabian Pesantes, who was giving him CPR, told News10: 'As I was touching the water, to wipe off my mouth, I was getting zapped. As I was performing CPR on the boy I was getting zapped.'

The boy's parents, who were visiting friends, received a call and Calder's father, Christopher Sloan, said he heard his wife scream, 'Is Calder dead?' as she ran outside.

The couple raced to Jackson North
 Medical Center, but their son had already passed.

While authorities say he was killed by a low voltage, an investigation is still underway into exactly what caused the death.

As his father stood in the backyard and paid tribute to his oldest son as he spoke to the Miami Herald, the rusty light fixture could be seen in the half-drained pool.

Sloan said that about nine months ago, he noticed that the pool light was broken so they hired a contractor to fix it. Among the family's grief and the chaos of organizing the funeral, they have not yet tracked down the name of the contractor.

Calder's dip into the pool on Sunday was the first time anyone had been in in months.

North Miami requires permits and 
inspections on pool electrical work, city spokeswoman Pam Solomon said, but city building
 department records don't indicate any permits at the Sloan home.

Electricians told family members earlier this week that the light switch to the 
pool wasn't grounded properly, so power that should have
 been diverted from the pool was instead going directly into it.

'Somebody did not do their job,' Chris Sloan said.

The family is now struggling to come to terms with the loss of the son they called 'Mr Awesome' while their youngest son, Caleb, tries to understand what has happened to his best friend.

'He was heaven-sent,' Chris Sloan told the Miami Herald as he stood by the pool.

'Any success in the world you've accumulated - financial, 
professional - anything you've accumulated means nothing when you lose a child, especially one who was such a gift to this world.

'I'm numb. It's very hard to cry anymore. He was simply what 
he was. He was Mr. Awesome.'

He remembered his son as a sports fan who loved basketball, soccer, fishing and kayaking. Just last week, he had celebrated his seventh birthday at a community soccer field.

'He was boundless with joy and energy,' his father said. 'A Calder kiss would be the greatest day of your life. He 
was so sweet and untainted. There's nothing to embellish here, it's just
 who he was.'

The family has returned to the house sporadically to collect clothes but they say they think they'll now move.

'I think we'll end up selling this house.
 I don't think we can live here,' he said. 'It was always a joy living 
in this house. Now it's dark, cold.'
