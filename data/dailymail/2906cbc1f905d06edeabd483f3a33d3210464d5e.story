Olympic gold medalist Cathy Freeman said she wanted to run away to the Americas and become a waitress after her win at the 2000 Sydney Olympics because the media scrutiny got too much for her.

Freeman also revealed she wanted to run away to the circus in a Living Black interview on SBS airing on Monday night as well as the influence her sister had on her career, the racism she faced as an indigenous athlete and her drive to win gold.

The athlete said she had 'seriously' considered moving to Central or South America to escape the growing attention that surrounded her after her iconic gold medal win in the 400m event in 2000, The Daily Telegraph reported.

'I had experience playing a big fat red kangaroo in Circus Oz and I wanted to join the circus because I wanted to just have fun,' the 41-year-old told Living Black host Karla Grant.

Despite her collected exterior during the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony, Freeman said she felt she had to win gold as there was 'no other option' for her and was definitely feeling the weight of that expectation on her shoulders.

The Olympian also told of the time following her 1994 gold medal win at the Commonwealth Games when she was going to give up athletics.

But it was not just her struggles with new-found fame that Freeman battled.

During the interview, she spoke candidly about racism and it was directed at her from as early as her time at primary school in Mackay - in Queensland's far north.

Freeman said she would watch trophies of the non-indigenous girls pile up as she went unrecognised.

'I think at the time I didn't really know what was going on,' she told SBS. 

'Goodness gracious I didn't really need to get a gold medal or a trophy because to me, all that mattered was that I crossed the line first.'

Freeman said what had upset her most about being denied her accolades was the negative reaction from her parents who 'were more upset' than her.

The racism continued throughout her career, coming from fellow athletes to receiving hate mail from the public.

But Freeman always rose above it, saying: 'I was never ever going to let it compromise my focus because in order to let that stuff into my mind…. it was going to distract me.'

Freeman's former training partner Nova Peris - who is now a Northern Territory senator - described their experience of receiving hate mail as unpleasant and labelled it 'absolutely disgusting'.

The person who had the biggest influence on Freeman's career was her sister, Anne-Marie, who died in 1990 after suffering an asthma attack - just three days after the Olympian won her first gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Auckland, New Zealand.

She said Anne-Marie was 'the most special and probably the most significant source of inspiration' for her.

'Just purely based on what she taught me in terms of the kind of person who I wanted to be,' Freeman said.

'Even though she might not be alive today, in my heart and in my mind she’s very much alive.'
