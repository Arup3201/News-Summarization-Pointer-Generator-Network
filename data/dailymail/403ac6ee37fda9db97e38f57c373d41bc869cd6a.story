Three Canadian prisoners who managed to escape their shackles in a helicopter earlier this month have been recaptured and returned to their detention center.

The three men had been arrested as 
part of a 2010 drug bust called Operation Crayfish that netted weapons, 
cars and a plane. They were awaiting trial on charges that included 
murder and gangsterism when a helicopter appeared on June 7 and flew 
them from a courtyard at the Orsainville Detention Centre outside of 
Quebec City  where they were being held under light security.

A day before the escape a judge had eased restrictions on the men allowing them to be in the courtyard at the same time on court days after they complained harsh security conditions were impeding their defence. Their
 escape set off an international manhunt, and the trio were added to an 
Interpol red notice list, reserved for the world's most wanted 
fugitives.

These three men were recaptured early this morning in Montreal two weeks after their brazen escape by helicopter from a detention center

Surete du 
Quebec officers arrested the trio at a Montreal residence at about 1:30 
a.m. this morning. Yves Denis, 35, Denis Lefebvre, 53, and Serge 
Pomerleau, 49, are scheduled to appear in court in Quebec City on 
Monday, according to CNN.

Police
 didn't divulge any more details about how they recaptured the fugitives
 or who was flying the helicopter, but more arrests in the case are 
expected.

The Quebec government has ordered an investigation into the incident, which will also look into a similar escape that took place in 2013.

In March of that year, two men posing as tourists commandeered a helicopter from a local tour company and ordered the pilot to fly over a detention center near Montreal. There they lifted two inmates to freedom using cables. The fugitives in that case were also eventually recaptured.

Other memorable helicopter escapes include a Greek prisoner who managed to fly away twice, in 2006 and again in 2009, and Joel David Kaplan's flight from a Mexican jail in 1971. The latter incident inspired a book and a movie.
