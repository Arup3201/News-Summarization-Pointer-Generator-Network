Ed Miliband faced embarrassment on the first day of the Labour conference when the roof fell in on his pledge to solve Britain’s housing crisis.

The Labour leader vowed to ensure 200,000 new homes a year are built by 2020 if he becomes Prime Minister. But Jennie Formby, the political director of Britain’s biggest union Unite, appeared to suggest it could be a con.

Anyone who assumed it meant a million homes would be built from 2015 to 2020 could be disappointed, she warned,

‘It’s not actually a promise to build a million homes,’ she said. ‘It’s a promise to be building 200,000 homes a year by the end of the government, which means it could be five or ten homes a year and then 200,000 in the last year.’

Ms Formby – revealed last year as the mother of Unite leader Len McCluskey’s love child – said her union needed to flex its muscles to make sure Mr Miliband delivered on such promises. She made the remarks at the Trades Union Congress earlier this month. At the fringe meeting, she boasted about the growing stranglehold unions have over Mr Miliband.

Ms Formby, 54, a member of Labour’s ruling national executive who earns £75,000 a year from Unite – whose members include construction workers – said the Labour leader should give in to a ‘whole list of demands and things we need to have’ if he wanted to win the next Election. She also:

Mr McCluskey, Unite’s general secretary, was married when Ms Formby had his son in 1991. Although their relationship did not endure, she now works as his right-hand woman.

Ms Formby told a fringe meeting at the TUC Conference: ‘If Labour forms the next government, our strength [and] influence is going to increase.’

The union would force Mr Miliband to back a ‘radical’ economic policy, she added, saying: ‘We’re not going to win an Election by saying to people “we’re going to deliver on austerity in a slightly nicer way than the Tories.”’

Jennie Formby, from the Unite union, who suggested Mr Miliband's pledge could be a con 

Of Mr Miliband, she said: ‘For all his faults, and perhaps the way he comes over sometimes, he is not Tony Blair. He’s absolutely not Tony Blair. He’s someone we feel we can work with.’

And she appeared to cast doubt on whether the party intended to carry out some of its policy pledges, saying: ‘If you look at a lot of Labour’s commitments, if they’re genuine [and] we deliver them,’ adding witheringly, ‘perhaps I should say if we deliver them...

‘If we’re going to deliver a Labour government with solid backing from trade unions… there’s a whole list of demands and things we need to have. Len’s set out his vision on many occasions.’

Unite helped Mr Miliband become Labour leader in 2010 and has since given the party more than £8 million.

Tory Party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Even Ed Miliband’s trade union bosses think his house building gimmick is nothing but another empty promise. Labour has no long-term plan for Britain’s future.

‘Labour’s trade union barons have steamrolled over Ed Miliband. They pick the policies, choose the candidates and bought the leader.’

A Unite spokesman said: ‘Nothing said at that meeting is out of kilter with the views of the majority of families in the UK today who are demanding new homes, secure employment, and better living standards.

‘That is what we support, that is what Ed Milliband is offering and that is what we believe the voters of the country will chose in May.’

A spokesman for Mr Miliband declined to comment.

Damned Mr Miliband with faint praise, saying he doesn’t ‘come over’ well, but ‘for all his faults, he is not Tony Blair’.

@highlight

Questioned whether Labour's Election pledges were 'genuine'.

Scorned Mr Miliband's claims that he would be tough as David Cameron on spending.
