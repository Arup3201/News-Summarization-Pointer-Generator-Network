Militant union leaders once again failed in their campaign to bring disruption to Britain after yesterday’s strikes were dismissed as a damp squib.

They were expecting around 400,000 public sector workers to join the latest wave of strikes and protests over pension reforms.

But ministers said the real figure was dramatically lower at 100,000 – down from the 146,000 who took part in last year’s walkout.

Anger: Some 20,000 off-duty officers from all 43 forces across England and Wales are expected to take part in the first police march in the capital for more than four years

Solidarity: 16,000 off-duty officers donned black caps representing each officer expected to be lost under the Government's cull as a result of budget cuts.

Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude 
said the action had been futile because nearly all the key public 
services remained ‘open as usual’.

There was minimal disruption of the health service, border checks 
continued to operate smoothly, jobcentres remained open, courts were 
sitting and driving tests went ahead.

Bosses at Heathrow said queues at immigration were ‘better than normal’,
despite action by passport control officers. Contingency plans to 
replace them with volunteers not only averted chaos, but improved 
efficiency.

Mr Maude said only nine jobcentres out of 700 had closed around the 
country while only four out of 407 operational courts and 97 tribunals 
had been affected.

The Department of Health confirmed ‘less than’ one 
per cent of the NHS staff who had been expected to turn up for work 
yesterday did not – and that included those who were off sick.

One of the court cases to fall 
victim to the strike was a triple murder trial at Maidstone Crown Court 
after two out of the three defendants failed to be produced by the 
Prison Service.

Judge Mr Justice Sweeney had to 
apologise to jurors who had turned up expecting to hear further evidence
about the case involving the deaths of three generations of one family 
in an arson attack on their home in Chatham, Kent.

One of those who died was Mr Muhammadi's estranged wife Melissa Crook (pictured together on their wedding day).

The judge told the jury: 'Your eagle eye would see that the defendants are rather sparsely populated.

'The reason is, because of 
industrial action, two male defendants have not been released by the 
Prison Service to the transport service to bring them here.

'I have ordered that they be brought
here. The transport is standing by to bring them here. The trick is 
getting them out of the prison to the transport.'

The two defendants who were not 
produced were Danai Muhammadi, 24, and Farhad Mahmud, 35, who deny three
counts of murder along with Emma Smith, 21, who was brought to court.

All three also deny two counts of attempted murder.

A brief spell of unofficial industrial action by prison officers was 
over by lunchtime and there was no reported disruption to Probation 
Services.

Mr Maude said: ‘The dedicated majority of public sector workers are 
working normally today and rigorous contingency plans are ensuring that 
nearly all key public services remain open as usual.

‘We can confirm that far fewer civil servants are on strike than in 
November – with around 100,000 taking part – down from 146,000 last 
year.

'Nevertheless it is very disappointing that a handful of unions 
insist on carrying on with futile action which will benefit no one.’

John Longworth, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, 
said: ‘By striking, public sector workers are threatening our economy 
when we need every bit of growth we can get.

‘Damaging business and public sector productivity through strikes will only hurt us all.’

Union leaders insisted the strike over reforms to generous public sector
pensions had been a huge success.

They claimed 200,000 civil servants, 
lecturers, health workers, MoD staff, immigration, police and prison 
officers had turned out.

The Public and Commercial Services union said 
there had been solid support for what was the third major walkout by 
public sector employees in the past six months.

The unions claim the reforms will leave millions of workers having to 
pay more into their pensions, retiring later and receiving less.

But ministers insist the current level of public sector pensions is unfair and unaffordable because people are living longer.

PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: ‘Instead of announcing made-up
figures to undermine the strike, Francis Maude should start meaningful 
negotiations about public service pensions.’

Enough is enough: Police Federation union placed this full-page adverts in several national newspapers ahead of the action today

Prison officers were reported to have walked out of 80 per cent of jails in England, Wales and Scotland, leaving only minimum cover and inmates on lockdown. However, they returned to work at lunchtime.

Around 30,000 off-duty police officers marched through Westminster to protest about changes to pay and conditions. Officers, who are banned from striking by law, face cuts to overtime and bonus payments, a later retirement age and less lavish pensions.

Police on sit-down strike: Police have been banned from striking since 1919 when almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty, causing havoc in London and Liverpool

Tory MP Dominic Raab said: ‘The 
hardliners scream blue murder about reformed pensions that give public 
sector workers far better deals than the vast majority of people in this
country can access.’

Militant union leaders are secretly urging fuel tanker drivers to reject
their latest pay and safety standards deal in a plot to cause a summer 
of disruption.

A cabal of firebrands inside the union is pressuring drivers to vote for
a strike that will cause forecourts to run dry and are likely to 
coincide with the Olympics and Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

The Mail has 
seen leaflets sent to members urging them to vote against a generous 
package approved by independent arbitration service Acas, even though it
meets their demands for a health and safety review.

Police officers across the UK are currently banned from taking strike action or joining a union under the Police Act 1996.

The ban has been in place since 1919 when the first police act was established following two strikes in Liverpool and London.

Complaining that pay for the average constable in a provincial force was £2.75 per week, the same as a street sweeper, almost every constable and sergeant refused to go on duty.

Their demands included a pay rise, 
improved war bonuses, extension of pension rights to include policemen's
widows and an allowance for school-aged children.

Then Prime Minister David Lloyd 
George, gave in on pay, but within months the union was 
crushed and the Police Federation founded.

It
is not a union, but has a statutory responsibility to represent its 
members - all officers below the rank of superintendent - in all matters
affecting their welfare and efficiency.

The few forms of industrial action police can legally take is a work-to-rule, which could severely hit the service, and withdraw from voluntary posts, such as policing football matches.

Other professions have agreements over strike action but, unlike the police, are not banned by law.

Nurses
can legally strike but the Royal College of Nursing, which represents 
two thirds of British nurses, has a ruling that they should only walk 
out where it would not affect the wellbeing or interests of patients.
