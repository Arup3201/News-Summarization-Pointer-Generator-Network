A teenager has opened his mouth for the first time in eight years after suffering an injury that left his jaw fused to the base of his skull. 

Shivam Sharma, from Hathras, Uttar Pradesh in India, has not been able to eat or speak since falling off a roof. The severe injury also severely restricted his breathing, causing him problems while sleeping.

But two doctors in India have been able to reconstruct his jaw using artificial joints - giving him back a fuller range of movement.

Now Mr Sharma, whose enforced  liquid diet has resulted in an ongoing deterioration of his health, is looking forward to finally eating solid foods again.

Dr. Ajoy Roychoudhury and Dr. Ongkila Bhutia, who carried out the complex surgery at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, claim it is the first surgery of its kind in India. 

Dr Roychoudhury, Professor and Head of the Department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at AIIMS, said: 'The condition from which Shivan suffered is called Total Temporomandibular Joint (TMJ) Ankylosis, which is generally caused due to trauma or fall, ear infection or inflammation.

'TMJ is the point of attachment of the lower jaw to the skull and it is the most complex joint of the human body. This replacement in the patient is now allowing him to open his mouth and talk and eat.'
