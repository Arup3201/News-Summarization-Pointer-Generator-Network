AFL club Melbourne has apologised for the 'poor and inconsiderate mistake' two of its players made by dressing up as Rolf Harris and a young girl for yesterday's 'Mad Monday' celebrations.

The Demons issued a statement saying they would investigate the incident after Dean Terlich, dressed as Harris, and teammate Alex Georgiou were photographed in the distasteful costumes.

Terlich put the photo on his Instagram account.

'Dean and Alex have made a poor and inconsiderate mistake in choosing their costume’s today,' a spokesman told the Herald Sun.

'We will speak to these players about their error in judgment.'

Wearing a fake goatee, grey wig, short red tie, striped blazer and rectangular glasses, Terlich's get-up was uncannily accurate to the musician, who was recently found guilty on 12 charges of indecent assault of four female victims and sentenced to five years and nine months in an England jail.

Terlich was snapped next to Georgiou, who was dressed as a girl, wearing a wig with long black plaits and a red checkered dress.

Another Demon player, Viv Michie posted to Instagram him dressed as Redfoo being glassed, just days after the 39-year-old singer was allegedly hit in the head with a glass at the Golden Sheaf Hotel in Sydney's prestigious suburb, Double Bay.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Melbourne Football Club for comment.

The Demons aren't the only ones dressed inappropriately for Mad Monday celebrations.

Brisbane Lions player Jordan Lisle was photographed wearing blackface, dressed as basketball superstar Lebron James.

The annual Mad Monday event is not foreign to controversy, resulting in players being forced to pay fines of up to $30,000.

Thankfully, some players' costumes were tactful and in good-spirit, which were shared on social media for AFL fans.
