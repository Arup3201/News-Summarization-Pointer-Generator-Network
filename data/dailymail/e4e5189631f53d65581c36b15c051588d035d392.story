A film crew suffered the scare of their lives when a giant great white shark sunk its' razor-sharp teeth into their inflatable rubber boat.

The MaxAnimal crew were filming for their popular YouTube channel off the coast of South Africa when the predator appeared several metres away.

Seconds later, the creature popped its' head out of the water and latched onto the boat relentlessly.

Terrifying: A great white shark was captured on film attacking a film crew as they stood powerless on a small rubber boat in the middle of the sea

Damaged: The rubber boat was left with a giant hole in one of its sides after the shark ripped into it with it's razor-sharp teeth

Powerless to deter the shark, the crew could do nothing but watch in horror as the animal chewed into the rubber ferociously.

The giant fish was then able to rip open one side of the boat as the crew watched in horror.

MaxAnimal describe their channel as 'merciless, ferocious, untamed, violently fun, weird and wacky and above all, wild animal videos' on their website.

They said they managed to make it back to shore with the semi-deflated raft staying afloat after the 'completely unprovoked' attack.

Unbelievable: The film crew watch in horror as the shark attacks the boat despite being 'completely unprovoked'

'The shark is fine and so is the crew,' a MaxAnimal spokesperson said on YouTube.

'Everyone made it out alive.'

They said the 'scariest' part of the ordeal was when the great white stares at those on board the boat.

The video has been seen by more than 750,000 people on YouTube.

Despite the terrifying encounter, the company described great whites as 'amazing creatures'.

'They should be respected and protected.'

Great white sharks can grow to 21 feet (four metres) in length and are one of the most feared creatures in the sea.

But they rarely attack for no reason, with experts claiming this particular shark was more likely curious as to what the boat was rather than attacking those on board.
