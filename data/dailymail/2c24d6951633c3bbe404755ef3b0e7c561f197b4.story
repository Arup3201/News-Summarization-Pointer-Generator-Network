A benefits cheat who claimed not to be able to walk has been caught working as a boxing instructor.

Mark Ashman, 51, has received over £20,000 of taxpayers' money by claiming incapacity and disability benefits.

But footage has emerged which shows him sparring with a partner in an outdoor boxing ring.

Ashman, from Wolverhampton, West 
Midlands, has swindled thousands of pounds on the basis it would take 
him ten minutes to walk 100 yards.

He complained of 'crippling arthritis' and said he needed round the clock care. 

But the conman has been exposed after fraud investigators filmed him jumping around with boxing pads on his hands.

The benefits cheat has been teaching the sport to children and adults, as well as running his own security business, Wolverhampton Magistrates Court heard.

A blow to the system: Mark Ashman (right) has been exposed as a benefit cheat after claiming incapacity benefit while working as a boxing instructor

Over a three year period, he has received £21,742.48 in incapacity and disability allowances.

He pleaded guilty to one count of failing to notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits between March 1 2009 and August 12 last year.

Chair of the magistrates Beryl Farrow said: 'Mr Ashman, what you have done is disgusting, taking money from society.

Lots of people can't even save that money in a lifetime.'

Though the court has suspended his case until they receive further reports, Ashman was told he could face jail.

'We need reports so I will adjourn the case for a later date until we have decided exactly what to do with you,' Farrow added.

Prosecuting Suki Rai, told the court: 'Mr Ashman was capable of undertaking activity that appeared to be incompatible with his benefits.

'He was able to coach boxing and the club confirmed he was self employed with his day and night security business.'

In his last self assesment in 1999, he said that due to arthritis in his right knee he considered himself 'very disabled', often finding it difficult to walk without a stick. 

He received £9,182.05 in disability benefits between March 1 2009 and August 12, 2012, and claimed £12,560.43 in incapacity benefit between October 1 2009 and January 2 2012.

His legal representative told the court: 'It is very sad Mr Ashman is before the court today.

He knows he is in the wrong and is extremely sorry. He knows he should have said something earlier.'

The case has been adjourned for sentencing on September 5.
