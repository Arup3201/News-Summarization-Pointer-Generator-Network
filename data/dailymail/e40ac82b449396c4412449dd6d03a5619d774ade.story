The contestants may look a million dollars when they step out to perform on X Factor but backstage it's all last minute wardrobe changes, demands from Simon Cowell and lots of stitching and sequins.

FEMAIL followed Gemma Sheppard, the show's head stylist, around for a day to see exactly what she gets up to and how she ensures the contestants transform from budding singers to fully-fledged X Factor stage stars.

'A lot of people ask me how we manage the X Factor wardrobe, where do the pieces come from, how do we put the outfits together, how we work with brands and shops to pull pieces in that we need,' explains Gemma as she sets off on her whirlwind day out.

Gemma's style journey starts each week with a creative meeting with all of production - including the four judges.

'We are briefed on the contestants' songs and the overall visual ideas for the performance,' she explains.

From this meeting, Gemma's first port of call for any of the looks is her fashion hub on Cavendish Square. 

Off they go! Gemma and her team set off for the shops and spend the day meeting fashion brands and curating looks for the contestants based on the production team and judges' demands

She said: 'My team and I set this up a couple of weeks before the series began, I call it my mini Selfridges. We have rails and shelves for each contestant, all clearly labelled and for all sorts of fashion eventualities. 

'The hub can provide a lot of what I need, but depending on the theme, I do also have to go out and about to bring in more pieces - so start a whirlwind of visits to designers, showrooms, shops and PR offices to gather in what we need. 

Gemma takes some of her team with her and they keep checking back in with the hub to drop off anything they have collected and take stock of where they are up to. 

Made to measure: Gemma and her assistants root around London's trendiest shops to source a stage-worthy outfit for each singer

She explained: 'Remember it isn't just the Saturday night performance look we are creating, but also the Sunday ensemble and the Sunday sing-off outfits.

'We have 24 hours to bring these looks together, so it is important we move fast, work quickly and keep focused on the job - but, of course, all in style!'.

While it may seem that Gemma has the world's best job, it doesn't come without its pressures.

Indeed, on Saturday night, just hours before showtime, the team decided to completely change Fleur's dress.

'The inspiration was Harlem Night and the high glamour of the 40s. We had created a gown for her from a Miss Selfridge dress, adding a fake fur cape to the hem. 

'At the dress rehearsal on Saturday afternoon, we decided that the look would work better in white - but we had our work cut out with about an hour to turn it around.'

Home from home: Gemma and her team are based in the style hub, which they call their mini Selfridges, and store all of the clothes before the weekend's show

Say cheese! Gemma has become extremely close with the contestants, such as Lauren Platt, and tries to give them confidence via their outfits 

The team used their creative prowess to completely revamp the look. They took a Zalando cocktail dress and removed the sleeves, deepened the neckline and one of Gemma's style assistants, Lucas, raced into town to buy ostrich feathers that they attached to the hem.  

Gemma explains: 'The team and I have 48 hours to prep the outfits before we go into sound check and rehearsal. We prep in the fashion hub and bring the outfits to the studios on a Friday. When we see the outfits on stage, with the lights, staging and choreography, that's when we can finesse the looks - which can mean adding a small detail through to, in this case with Fleur, actually making the whole dress in a new colour.'

'Fleur has an exquisite body so creating dresses to fit her shape is a dream,' said Gemma. 'We added Aldo boots to bring the look up-to-date so she could carry off the Big Band/retro version of Bang Bang.' 

After the Sunday night show, Gemma and her team pack down the fashion wagon at the studio. On Monday, they open the hub, return pieces that have been used and tidy and re-stock each contestants' rail.

Then they are ready for Tuesday's creative meeting and what lies ahead for the next show and the whole process starts all over again.

Quick change: The team used their creative prowess to completely revamp Fleur's look from a Miss Selfridge dress, right. They took a Zalando cocktail dress and removed the sleeves, deepened the neckline and one of Gemma's style assistants, Lucas, raced into town to buy ostrich feathers that they attached to the hem
