It could be a snap taken from a fun filled family holiday, as a diver who is grinning from ear to ear swims in glorious blue waters wearing nothing but flippers, goggles and a pair of Speedos.

But look closer and at that shadow lurking below and the scene becomes less one of happiness and more one of horror.

That's because the bold swimmer is actually a marine conservationist who has decided to take a dip with a great white shark circling ominously beside him.

Posed up: The relaxed diver spreads his arms in joy despite the fact that a 10-foot killer is lurking in the shadows belowÂ 

Closer look: The diver is part of a team of conservationists who take pictures on marine environments in a bid to boost conservation projects

Care free: The swimmer, sporting little other than some swimming equipment and a pair of Speedos, came within touching distance of the shark

While most will only share the killer fish's natural environment with the help of a reenforced cage, this scientist is part of a team who feel quite at home floating withing touching distance of the powerful predator.

They spotted the beast whilst swimming off the coast of the Baja 
Peninsula in Mexico.

The divers, who take underwater images of stunning marine environments to support conservation projects, documented their encounter with the shark in this series of stunning snaps.

Teamwork: He was joined by another photographer in a wetsuit who swam alongside the dangerous animals to capture the stunning images

So close: The second snapper appears to take his life in his own hands as he reaches out to touch the great white's tail

Unconcerned by the prospect of being 
torn to shreds by the deadly species which, up until 2012, had
 been responsible for 69 human deaths, the care free swimmer and his 
camera crew happily circled the sedate beast.

Swirling among schools of fish, the 
photographers even posed alongside the beast, coming within 
inches of being able to pull its tale.

Sharks typically attack humans when 
they mistake them for seals or other marine animals which form part of 
their diet. They have been known to attack people to take 'test bites', 
with experts claiming a shark can tell whether or not a target is worth 
eating with one assault.

In the deep: The shark was spotted off the Baja Peninsula, Mexico, where the the diver's group Pelagic Life are promoting conservation efforts

Beauty: The circling great white weaved in and out of giant schools of fish creating this amazing scene

The divers, from conservation group Pelagic Life, thankfully looked different enough from a fatty and protein rich seal for the shark to leave them alone.

And while the beast was in a placid mood, the team went to work creating these stunning set of images.

They will be used as part of the not-for-profit organisations ongoing battle to promote conservation of these warm water environments, where species such as the great white thrive.

No mistake: Thankfully, the shark did not mistake the diver in the black wetsuit for a seal, that mix up is often blamed for unprovoked great white attacks

On his way: The divers could not resist one last reach towards the powerful animal as it swam off into the deep
