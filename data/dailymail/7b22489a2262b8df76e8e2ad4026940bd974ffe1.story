Julie Matthews, 48, failed to tell the 
DWP and local council that her husband 
had moved back in with her

A mother-of-three who falsely claimed more than £17,000 in benefits did not declare she was married because her husband was gay and so she did not consider them a couple. 

Julie Matthews, 48, from Wombwell, near Barnsley, was given a 20-week jail term suspended for a year after she admitted dishonestly receiving £17,541 in benefits. 

Barnsley Magistrates’ Court heard Matthews and her husband Ian married in 2003 but had not lived together ‘for a significant period of time’, before he moved back home in 2011.

But she failed to notify the Department of Work and Pensions and Barnsley council of the change in her circumstances, the court was told.

When confronted by benefits investigators, Matthews said her husband stayed with her ‘now and again’ and she had failed to declare she was married.

At an earlier hearing, prosecutor Jayne Ormrod said how Matthews did not consider them to be a couple because Mr Matthews was gay. 

Matthews, a mother-of-three and grandmother-of-five, admitted falsely claiming Jobseekers’ Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, housing and council tax benefits and two social fund loans.

The prosecution said: 'On one occasion she said she lived alone, was not working and had no other finances. On another occasion she said she was too ill to work.

'She later said she should have declared to the Department of Work and Pensions and the council that she was living with her husband and that there had been a change in her circumstances.'

Matthews' solicitor Morgan Hogarth said 
that before 2011 her husband had not been living with her, but he had 
moved back because she had problems with the neighbours and was 
'frightened'.

Mr Hogarth said the money she received 
went on day-to-day living expenses and any extra helped to fund her 
daughter, who was setting up home with two young children. 

Matthews was given a 20-week jail term suspended for 12 months at Barnsley Magistrates' Court (pictured). She was also ordered to carry out community work and given a night-time curfew

He said Matthews had three children from her first relationship which ended when she was 23 and she was also a grandmother of five.

She was the regular carer for four of the grandchildren and had also been lined up to care for a niece.

Her father was terminally ill with cancer and she would miss his last few months if she was jailed, he said.

Matthews, whose husband was in court to support her, was given a 20-week jail term suspended for 12 months. 

She was also ordered to carry out 100 hours of unpaid community work, a specified activity for 15 days working with female offenders and was given a night-time curfew,

She will re-pay the money she owed at a rate of £19 a week, by starting a new job as a cleaner this weekend.

Matthews declined to comment when she left Barnsley Magistrates' Court.
