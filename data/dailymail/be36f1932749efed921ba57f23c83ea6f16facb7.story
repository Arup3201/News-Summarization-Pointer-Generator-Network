David Luiz splits opinion among many in football and it appears Roy Hodgson isn't his biggest fan too following reports in France.

The Brazil international became the most expensive defender in  history this summer following his £50million switch to French giants Paris Saint-Germain from Chelsea.

The 27-year-old signed a five-year deal at the Parc des Princes and according to French publication L'Equipe the England boss questioned PSG's decision to sign the centre-back.

Hodgson's alleged comments come in a meeting including PSG boss Laurent Blanc this summer

In a meeting with PSG president and owner Nasser Al Khelaifi, along with manager Laurent Blanc during the summer, Hodgson is reported to have been quizzical over the transfer.

‘But how could your club take David Luiz? He makes at least one error in concentration a game! £50m is crazy,’ the 67-year-old is quoted as saying.

Luiz endured a torrid end to his World Cup with the host nation Brazil at this summer's showpiece - captaining his country as they suffered an embarrassing 7-0 defeat in the semi-finals to eventual winners Germany.

The former Chelsea defender's display in that match saw him earn a lot of criticism which was further compounded by the five-time tournament winners 3-0 capitulation against Holland in the third-place play-off encounter.

Since moving to the French capital though, Luiz has enjoyed a relatively smooth start with his new club keeping four clean sheets in the seven games he has featured in all competitions.
