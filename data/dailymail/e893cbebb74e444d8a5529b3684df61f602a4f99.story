As same sex relationships become more acceptable, the more visible they are and the more we can learn about them.

Or should I say learn from them, since most of the research that is emerging about gay relationships suggests they can teach us straights more than a thing or two!

It’s not easy being gay and being different to the norm. But turns out there’s a huge pay off for having to fight for the right to love who you want without judgement.

Gay relationships appear to work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways.

Gay relationships work better than straight relationships in lots of key ways, says Tracey Cox

Here’s what we can learn from same sex couples: 

1. They’re not hung up on male or female stereotypes of who should do what in a relationship.

Couples in same sex relationships don’t just slot into what’s expected. They divide up the chores and roles in their relationship on who is best at them, rather than ‘that’s the man’s job’ or ‘woman’s job’.

The result is they work better as a team - and there’s less resentment over silly, sexist things like secretly thinking ‘He should be earning more than me’ or ‘She should be the one emptying the dishwasher’.

2. They fight fair

US relationships guru John Gottman, one of the world’s foremost experts on relationships, says same sex couples are far kinder and nicer to each other during arguments than straights are.

They don’t personally attack each other, they’re more positive, less domineering and belligerent.

Same sex couples also laugh more during a row - which is the best way to remind you both that you actually like each other, even if you don’t like what one of you did or didn’t do!

Gottman found gay men and women were also more affectionate, listened more and were less defensive in arguments.

Why are they so much better at it than heterosexuals?

One reason is that power is equal. There’s less bullying and less blaming of problems on gender because you don’t have set expectations of each other’s roles.

In society, women are expected to be the pacifiers and men the ‘fixers’. But sometimes it’s women who are good at coming up with practical solutions and men who are good at soothing.

Same sex couples tend to let whoever is best at something take over.

3. They’re more experimental sexually

Male/female sex falls into a set pattern from a very early age. Usually, the guy initiates, there’s foreplay (generally more for her than him) and intercourse is very much the main event.

Lesbians, on the other hand, are much less penetration orientated and orgasm orientated: they just do whatever they feel like in that particular sex session.

Gay men are far more experimental with different types of sex rather than sticking rigidly to the ‘vanilla’, basic type of sex straight people in long-term relationships tend to have.

4. They’re happy to show and tell

Lots of straight women are often too embarrassed to let their partner watch them masturbate.

Gay men love showing off - and watching other guys turn themselves on. They also watch carefully to see what technique they use, so they can copy it later.

Lesbians often have mutual masturbation sessions and consequently know a lot more about what techniques their partner likes than the average straight couple.

5. They don’t have to deal with the in-laws

Meeting each other’s parents and seeing them regularly as a couple is pretty much standard for most straight couples.

But not all gays are at the same point in the coming-out process and not all families are tolerant and open to gay relationships.

This means less forced visits with relatives you might not necessarily get on with - which means less rows about the in-laws.

6. They don’t get hung up on porn

Partners watching porn is often frowned upon and seen as threatening by women in straight relationships.

Gay men understand that men simply like looking at sexy things and same sex couples generally are more tolerant of each other’s differences.
