He was no doubt delighted to have finally fulfilled his boyhood dream of appearing in The Dandy.

But unfortunately for Sir Paul McCartney, his cartoon character has captured the looks of his ex-wife Heather Mills too.

The shape of his face is identical to hers and the arched eyebrows, long nose and lips are also the same.

In a recent letter to the comic, Sir Paul said: 'The Dandy was a favourite comic of mine when growing up in Liverpool and each week I would look forward to the exploits of Desperate Dan... I feel a little sadness that I see its final issue is appearing in December'. Now his dream's come true, except he looks like his ex, Heather Mills

The pair were married in 2002, but had a highly acrimonious £24million divorce six years later.

The 70-year-old is starring alongside Desperate Dan and friends in next week’s final print issue of The Dandy.

In February 1963 – a month before The Beatles released their first LP – the singer told music magazine NME that his personal ambition was ‘To have my picture in The Dandy!’

Almost 50 years later, he contacted the publication when it announced it would stop printing on its 75th birthday.

Launched in 1937, The Dandy is Britain’s longest-running children’s comic.

The pair (seen here in 2007) were married in 2002, but had a highly acrimonious £24m divorce six years later

The Dandy's print editor, Craig Graham, said: 'When the decision was taken to stop printing The Dandy and take it online earlier this year, it really was a case of now or never'

At its peak in the 1950s, it sold more than two million copies a week, but its circulation has since slumped to less than 8,000.

In a recent letter to the publication, Sir Paul said: ‘The Dandy was a favourite comic of mine when growing up in Liverpool and each week I would look forward to the exploits of Desperate Dan and his other comic book colleagues.

‘I feel a little sadness that I see its final issue is appearing in December.

'In 1963, in the NME, when asked what my personal ambition was, I replied – to have my picture in The Dandy! I hope it’s not too late!’

In the final issue, Sir Paul’s 
cartoon persona will lead a sing-along with the comic’s most famous 
characters at a farewell party.

The
Dandy’s print editor, Craig Graham, said: ‘When the decision was taken 
to stop printing The Dandy and take it online earlier this year, it 
really was a case of now or never.

'Sir
Paul wrote a lovely letter to us, wishing The Dandy well and hoping it 
wasn’t too late to make an appearance. How could we refuse?’

The last print issue of The Dandy will go on sale on Tuesday.

The first digital issue will go live on www.dandy.com on the same day.
