Ryan Giggs will brief the Manchester United players on the strengths and weaknesses of Leicester City before Sunday's match, in a new role given to him by manager Louis van Gaal.

The former United winger has been entrusted with the role of giving a team talk about the opposition after being impressed with his assistant's eye for detail.

Van Gaal's scout Marcel Bout puts together a report on future opponents, which Gigg's reads and then prepares his team talk.

Giggs now gives the Manchester United team talks regarding opposition players and tactics

'Giggs gives a presentation to me,' Van Gaal told The Telegraph. 'I check it and he presents it to the players.'

It is a big show of trust in Giggs, and the same job that the Dutchman gave to Jose Mourinho when the two worked together at Barcelona. 

Van Gaal velieves that preparation is vital, and that his team must improve as much mentally as physically as they seek to mount a title challenge.

Giggs knows the squad extremely well, having only retired for playing for United at the end of last season

Dutch manager Van Gaal insists that preparation in regards to the opposition is key for his United team

'I prepare all my matches very thoroughly. I know everything about the team, about individual players, about the substitutes. 

'I know what the atmosphere will be in the stadium, how they will take the first kicks, everything.' 

'I am training my players in the brain and that's why it is so difficult. And of course, you are right, I give a lot of information and that is what they have to get to know, what they have to use of that information. 

The Manchester United manager says he has 'four books' of information on Sunday's opponents Leicester

Jose Mourinho performed similar duties under Louis van Gaal when they worked together at Barcelona
