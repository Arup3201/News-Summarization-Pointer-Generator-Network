Norwich have agreed a fee with Stoke City for Cameron Jerome. The 28-year-old also has an offer from Celtic but has been offered better terms by Norwich who are ambitious to return to the Premier League.

Norwich also moved to sign free agent defender Carlos Cuellar, 32.

The new arrivals could pave the way for midfielder Leroy Fer to leave the club. The Holland international has been pursued by QPR manager Harry Redknapp throughout the summer.

Incoming? The Canaries are also considering a move for free agent Carlos Cuellar

Rangers have agreed an £8 million fee with Ranger for the 24-year-old after having an initial £4m offer turned down and then a further proposal of cash plus midfielder Karl Henry.

Fer was part of Holland's World Cup squad that reached the semi-finals of the World Cup under Louis van Gaal and is keen on a return to the Premier League.

He signed for Norwich last summer after missing out on a move to Everton the previous January following a knee injury.
