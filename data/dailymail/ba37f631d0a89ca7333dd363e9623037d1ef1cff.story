Pope Francis waded into the debate on gay marriage today -  telling the Archbishop of Canterbury he wants to work together to promote family values ‘based on marriage’.

Pope Francis - who vehemently opposed gay nuptials in his native Argentina - and Archbishop Justin Welby met for the first time after becoming the new leaders of their respective faiths.

Speaking after their encounter in Vatican City, Pope Francis said he hoped the two leaders could collaborate in promoting the sacredness of life ‘and the stability of families founded on marriage.’

Gay marriage debate: Pope Francis told the Archbishop of Canterbury today that he wants 
to work together to promote family values ‘based on marriage’

Archbishop Welby has spoken out against the legalisation of gay marriage in Britain, saying it would undermine family life.

The legislation would enable gay couples to get married in both civil and religious ceremonies in England and Wales.

The meeting of minds on the controversial issue is a rare moment of agreement between the two churches amid strained relations.

The Pope praised the Archbishop for ‘recalling the value of marriage’.

He said: ‘ Particularly important is 
our witness to the reference to God and the promotion of Christian 
values in a world that seems at times to call into question some of the 
foundations of society, such as respect for the sacredness of human life
or the importance of the institution of the family built on marriage, a
value that you yourself have had occasion to recall recently.’

Francis has long taken a hard line on the issue.

As archbishop of Buenos Aires he 
clashed with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner on gay marriage, 
calling it an ‘anthropological step backward’. He has also insisted that
adoption by gays and lesbians is a form of discrimination against 
children.

Today's meeting was billed as a chance to reduce tensions between the Catholic and Anglican churches

Both leaders, inaugurated within days of each other, acknowledged differences between their churches

Archbishop Welby said the two churches were ‘absolutely at one’ on the issue of gay marriage.

The major point of difference between
the denominations has been the ordination of women priests in the 
Anglican Church, which has since witnessed a  steady stream of 
disenchanted Anglicans, who have been welcomed with open arms into the 
Catholic Church.

His predecessor Pope Benedict caused 
uproar in the hierarchy of the Anglican Church when in 2009 he 
introduced structures to ease disenchanted Anglicans into Catholicism.

The Pope acknowledged the ‘painful 
history’ between their churches, admitting that ‘difficulties have 
arisen in our theological dialogue that were greater than we could have 
foreseen at the start of our journey.’

He added: ‘The history of relations between the Church of England and 
the Catholic Church is long and complex, and not without pain.’

Archbishop Welby said the differences between the churches were ‘ testing ‘.

’But a firm foundation of friendship will enable us to be hopeful in speaking to one another about those differences,’ he said.

The Vatican's bold step to welcome back Anglicans came nearly 500 years after King Henry VIII broke away

In
2009, Benedict decreed that Anglicans who feel their Church had become 
too liberal could find a home in Catholicism in a parallel hierarchy 
that allows them to keep some of their traditions, such as parts of the 
Anglican liturgy and the Anglican Book of Common Prayer.

It was the boldest step by the 
Vatican to welcome back Anglicans since King Henry VIII broke with Rome 
and set himself up at the head of the new Church of England in 1534.

Francis
said he was sure the move would help the Catholic world to better 
appreciate and understand the spiritual and pastoral traditions of the 
Anglican community.

Welby, a
former oil industry executive, has inherited a Church which is itself 
divided over issues such as gay rights and women bishops. He is against 
gay marriage but favours female ordination, and is stuck in the 
crossfire between liberal and conservative clerics.

After addressing the pope and Vatican officials, Welby went on to pray at the tomb of Saint Peter under St. Peter's Basilica.

The historic meeting comes as it 
emerges that Francis’ predecessor, Benedict, will escape prosecution for
‘crimes against humanity’ for his part in the church’s cover up of 
abuse, including sexual violence.

The International Criminal Court 
(ICC) has rejected an application by The Centre for Constitutional 
Rights to investigate Benedict and other Vatican officials, saying it is
outside the jurisdiction of the court.

Legal experts had said that Benedict 
could face charges after losing his immunity from prosecution as head of
state after stepping down in February.

Lawyers for the victims claimed that Benedict had been put in place policies through which abuse could continue.
