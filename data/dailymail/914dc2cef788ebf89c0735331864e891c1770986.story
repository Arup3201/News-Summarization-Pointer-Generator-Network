Pop star Rihanna spent a weekend at the beach in Thailand, leaving behind a trail of racy tweets and incriminating Instagram photographs that led police to arrest two people for allegedly peddling protected primates.

On a break from her Diamonds World Tour, Rihanna stopped in Thailand to visit the island of Phuket, where she befriended some local wildlife.

She posted a link on Twitter to an Instagram photo that showed her in sunglasses snuggling up to a furry primate called the slow loris, and tweeted Friday: 'Look who was talkin dirty to me!'

Pop singer by day, unintentional animal activist by night: Thai police arrested two men for selling photo ops with protected-species the slow loris after Rihanna posted a picture of herself with one on Instagram

The slow loris, a squirrel-like animal with big eyes, is native to Southeast Asia and is listed as a protected species.

Thai police must have been keeping tabs on Rihanna, because after she posted the picture with the slow loris Friday night, police in Phuket raided Bangla Road the following day to hunt out louts peddling the lorises for pictures with tourists.

'I had an order from the Phuket Governor to do a raid today after Rihanna posted a photo of her with the loris,' Awat Nithikil, leader of the patrol officers and senior forest academic at Khao Phra Taew Forest Preserve, told the Phuket News.

'It is very difficult to do the raids because the touts have spies. If someone hears that the police are coming their way, there will be a person who calls the touts and tells them to move,' he said.

But this time police were successful and apprehended two louts who were selling pictures with lorises.

One of the herd: The slow loris wasn't the only wildlife Rihanna checked out in Thailand. She posted another picture of her interacting with a herd of elephants

Police confiscated two lorises from 
the pair — a 20-year-old man and a 16-year-old boy — who could face 
charges of possession of protected animals. The charge carries a penalty
of up to four years in prison and a 40,000 baht ($1,300) fine.

Mr Nithikil said it was important to 
conduct the raid after Rihanna posted the picture because it could 
affect the country's reputation.

Phuket
District Chief Weera Kerdsirimongkon said authorities have tried for 
years to crack down on the problem of vendors exploiting wildlife, 
particularly in popular tourist areas where people pay to

pose for 
pictures with elephants, orangutans and other animals.

'It's
like a cat-and-mouse game. But this time it's bigger because a 
celebrity like Rihanna posted the picture, and there were more than 
200,000 "likes" from around the world,' he said.

Rihanna
also posted pictures of herself playing with a herd of elephants in the
street Friday night, after which she tweeted: 'They all hail Empress 
when She walk by.'

The two lorises will be taken to a national park in Phang Nga.
