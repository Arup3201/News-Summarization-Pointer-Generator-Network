A manor house built by author Henry Williamson on land he bought for £125 in the 1920s has gone on sale for £900,000

Williamson, who wrote Tarka The Otter, built the magnificent five-bed manor house on 1.5 acres of land he bought after winning a literature competition for his best-selling book, published in 1927.

The esteemed author spent most of his life living in a tiny writing hut in the sprawling grounds of Ox’s Cross, near Braunton, North Devon.

Author Henry Williamson bought this land near Georgeham in Devon for just £125 in the late 1920s before building a manor house there in the mid 1970s

The five-bedroom manor, which has a staircase covered with carvings of some of Williamson's most beloved characters, has now gone on sale for £900,000

The land was bought by Williamson using £25 he had saved and another £100 he won from a writing competition with his first book Tarka The Otter

But he spent his final years in the manor house which boasts stunning views of Exmoor, Dartmoor and the sea.

The whole estate - complete with vegetable plots, greenhouses and ponds - has been put on the market for £900,000.

Colin Thorne, manager at estate agents Webber’s Fine and Country, said: 'How the house came about is a lovely little story.

'Henry Williamson had various traumas through the First World War and came back with an idea generated during the war - the need to find peace and solitude and tranquillity.

Williamson only lived in the house during his final years. He spent most of his working life living in a small writing cottage in the grounds of Ox’s Cross, North Devon

As well as building the house (left), Williamson (right), also built a small writing hut on a nearby piece of land which sold for £125,000 during an auction in May

The house comes  a formal garden, a large vegetable garden, and views of the sea during the winter months when the leaves have fallen off the trees

'He wanted somewhere to go where quietness would inspire and give then the chance to work.

'He found this land and the farmer wanted £125. He only had £25. But he published Tarka The Otter and won £100 in the Hawthornden Prize. He had the money he needed.'

Williamson first built a writing hut on a now-separate piece of land near the home in 1929, which sold for more then £125,000 at auction in May.

But in the mid 1970s he built the main Ox’s Cross home, designed in beautiful 1950’s Arts and Crafts Movement style, where he lived until he died in 1977.

Mr Throne added: 'It really is spookily therapeutic. The grounds are just idyllic, with views of Exmoor and Dartmoor on a clear day, and in the winter when the leaves aren’t on the trees you can see the sea.'

The house also comes with a fenced paddock which is currently used to house goats, as well as views over Exmoor and Dartmoor

The house also has views over the the Estuary of the Taw and River Torridge, two waterways where character Tarka supposedly lived

Ox’s Cross sits high above the popular North Devon village of Georgeham, with views across to the Estuary of the Taw and Torridge - the two rivers where the character of Tarka supposedly lived.

The land is divided into a formal garden, a large vegetable garden, mature trees and a fenced paddock which is currently home to goats.

The main house has four bedrooms plus an attic room, a study, a principal sitting room with a galleried landing, a feature Minster style fireplace with wood burning stove, and a staircase with carvings of Henry Williamson’s best loved characters.

Downstairs there is a snug with a wood burner, a south facing dining room overlooking the garden and a kitchen with an Aga.
