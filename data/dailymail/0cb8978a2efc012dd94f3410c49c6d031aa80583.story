Newcastle United midfielder Moussa Sissoko has again spoken of his Arsenal ‘dream’ - but it would take an offer of more than £20million to trigger any deal before Monday night’s deadline.

The Magpies have made it known that they would only entertain a ‘ridiculous’ approach for their star player, with Arsenal, PSG and Liverpool all interested.

But in making that stance public, supporters fear they are courting such a sum.

Head coach John Carver joked that it would take a bid of £50m to land Sissoko, but a figure of less than half that amount is more realistic for a player who only cost £1.5m when he signed from Toulouse two years ago.

It is more likely, however, that Sissoko will leave Tyneside in the summer.

And the 25-year-old has again spoken of his admiration for Arsenal.

The France international is reportedly attracting interest from Paris Saint-Germain

‘Arsenal made me dream when I was a youngster. Patrick Vieira was my idol. I saw myself in him,’ he said.

‘For now, I'm a Newcastle player and I am happy at the club. I want to play in major competitions and I want to do it with this team.'

Newcastle left back Davide Santon is set to return to Inter Milan on loan for the remainder of the season, with a view to a permanent move, while the club look set to have missed out on the signature of Milton Keynes Dons youngster Dele Alli - who is at Tottenham Hotspur for a medical.
