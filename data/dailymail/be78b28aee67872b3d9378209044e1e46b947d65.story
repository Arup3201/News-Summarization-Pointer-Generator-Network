An Islamic extremist admitted trying to behead Fusilier Lee Rigby because ‘the most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular’, a court heard yesterday.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, said he drove his car into Mr Rigby before he sawed his neck and then ‘attempted to remove his head’, the jury was told.

During a series of police interviews which were played to the Old Bailey yesterday, Adebolajo said he and his accomplice Michael Adebowale, 22, waited near Woolwich Barracks for a soldier to appear.

Victim: The alleged killers of Lee Rigby cut his throat because it was 'humane', a court has heard

He said that they attacked the soldier as he was a ‘fair target’ and because they ‘wished to fulfil our promise to Allah’.

The
defendant said they selected Mr Rigby simply because he was the first 
soldier to appear on the South London street where they were waiting on 
May 22. ‘It was almost as if Allah had chosen him,’ he said. When I 
thought about obeying Allah in the past I thought maybe it is possible 
to kill a man by driving into him.

‘When
he crossed the road in front of me so casually it was almost as if I 
was not in control of myself. I accelerated, I hit him and I think I 
also crashed into a sign post.

‘We
did not wish to give him much pain...I could see he was still alive. We
exited the vehicle and I am not sure how I struck the first blow.

‘The
most humane way to kill any creature is to cut the jugular. This is 
what I believe. This is how we kill our animals in Islam. He may be my 
enemy but he is a man...so I struck at the neck and attempted to remove 
his head.’

Adebolajo was 
then asked if he had expected to die on the day of the attack. He 
replied: ‘To be killed on the battlefield is not something we shy away 
from and, in fact, this is something that Allah loves.’

The
footage of the interviews at Southwark Police Station shows Adebolajo 
wearing a blue blanket, which at some points almost completely covered 
his face.

At times the 
suspect stooped down and appeared to read passages from a gold and black
copy of the Koran which was lying open on the table in front of him. He
repeatedly asked to be called Mujahid Abu Hamza and stormed out of two 
of the four interviews after becoming angry.

During
the first interview he ranted for 40 minutes, often wagging a finger in
the air, about British troops ‘committing mass murder’ in Muslim lands.
He said there was a ‘war between Muslims and the British people’ and he
was a ‘soldier of Allah’.

When
asked about the soldier’s killing, he said: ‘He was struck on the neck 
with a sharp implement and it was sawn until his head, you know, became 
almost unattached.

'And may Allah forgive me if I acted in a way that’s 
displeasing to him.’

Giving
evidence at the Old Bailey yesterday, Detective Constable Dhuval Bhatt 
said he conducted an urgent interview with Adebolajo while he was still 
being treated in hospital to establish if there were going to be further
attacks.

Adebolajo and 
Adebowale deny murdering Mr Rigby, conspiring to murder a police officer
and attempted murder.  They admit possessing a firearm. The trial 
continues.
