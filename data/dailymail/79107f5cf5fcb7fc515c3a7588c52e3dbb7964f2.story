It may not come as a surprise that notorious tomboy Cara Delevingne struggled to grasp the art of walking in high heels.

But the supermodel has an interesting tip for anyone wanting to master a catwalk strut.  

Speaking on W magazine's 'Screen Test' the 22-year-old model says: 'It took me so long to learn to walk in high heels it was a joke.

'When you first start walking you walk like you've never had sex, and then someone told me, I can't remember who it was, "walk like you're having sex and like you've had loads of sex".'

The 22-year-old model speaks candidly to the camera in a short black and white film made during her cover shoot and interview for the October issue of W magazine

Self confessed tomboy Cara was seen leaving Abbey Road studios last night wearing the same Chanel beanie hat she wore in the video interview for W magazine 

Wearing a knitted Chanel beanie hat, Cara speaks candidly to the camera in the short black and white film, made during her cover shoot and interview for the October issue of W magazine.

In the interview the blonde reveals that she is not immune to insecurities when it comes to work.

Speaking about her skin condition psoriasis the model says that her experience has made her want to start a help group. She said: 'After fashion week I had really bad psoriasis, just covered in red scabs. 

'I want to start something where people who have psoriasis can talk to each other because it really affects your confidence.

'People in Milan would look at me like I was a leper and put on gloves and not want to touch me.'

As well as talking about her desire to meet the Queen and her numerous tattoos Cara also reveals some rather unusual facts about her family and childhood.

'It took me a long time to start wearing clothes, I used to love being naked.

'My parents would have to dress me because I'd just run around the supermarket and take off all my clothes. It was fun. Freedom. Liberation!

'We have a pretty nudist family. I remember going to nude beaches a lot when I was younger.'

Cara, who is the youngest daughter of Pandora and Charles Delevingne and has two older sister Chloe and Poppy, is notoriously outspoken in interviews.

She hit headlines just this week by declaring that men are more difficult to become friends with because they 'only want to have sex with you'. 

The model has a large group of female pals - including Rihanna, Rita Ora, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger - and revealed to the Best of Beauty edition of Allure magazine that she prefers to be in their company because men only ever want to sleep with her.
