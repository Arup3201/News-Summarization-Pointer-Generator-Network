Strength: Austin Hatch hopes to play college basketball at University of Michigan next year after surviving two plane crashes which killed his entire family

In the ten months since the horrific plane crash which killed his entire family, Austin Hatch has made an incredible recovery, focusing on looking forward to his dream of playing college basketball.

On June 24 last year, a small plane piloted by his father and carrying his stepmother and two pet dogs crashed after leaving Fort Wayne in Indiana and trying to land at Charlevoix Airport.

Austin told the Detroit Free Press this week that he is determined to play with the Wolverines at the University of Michigan in 2013.

Austin said: 'The most difficult thing is just missing my biological family, because I’m the only one left.

'I wish there was an instructional manual in how to deal with this kind of loss.'

The 16-year-old suffered a brain injury, punctured lung, broken ribs and was put into a drug-induced coma following the crash which only he and one dog survived. 

Austin said he will use a basketball scholarship for Michigan in the class of 2013
to live the life he and his father always imagined.

However the 17-year-old has yet to 
be cleared to play - but has put his trust in his doctors.

The teenager also said that he didn't believe anyone else could relate
to his situation.

'No one that I know of,' he said.

'If there is someone, I haven’t met them yet.'

Last month, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a report that the crash that killed Austin's father, Dr Stephen Hatch and his stepmother Kim, occurred after the single-engine plane stalled because of inadequate air speed. The report said Stephen Hatch failed to follow the proper protocol.

After the aircraft missed its instrument landing approach at the Charlevoix Municipal Airport, Dr Hatch turned around and attempted a second landing on the runway from the opposite direction before crashing into a garage in a neighborhood near the airport, according to witness statements.

Stephen Hatch, who was an anesthesiologist and partner at Pain Management Associates, also was piloting a similar plane in September 2003 that crashed in Indiana.

His other children, Lindsay, 11, and five-year-old Ian, died along with 
his first wife, Julie, 38. Austin, who was eight years old at the time, only survived when his father flung him out of the burning plane.

Following last year’s crash en route 
to a summer home near Boyne Falls in northern Michigan, Austin Hatch was
in a medically-induced coma for weeks before returning to Fort Wayne.

He was a standout basketball player 
at Canterbury High School in Fort Wayne. He didn’t play basketball for 
Canterbury this past season. 

Austin Hatch had a serious head injury from last year’s crash and admitted that his recovery has been difficult.

'My dad’s dad, my grandpa Jim Hatch, 
he’s as close a thing to my dad as there is,' he said. 'So he’s been 
very instrumental in helping me with the recovery process.'

Austin was given a small measure of comfort last year when his dog, a labradoodle named Brady, was found wandering near the crash site in the days following the accident.

The teenager's basketball coach at Fort Wayne Canterbury High last year spoke about the student's strength of character after the family tragedies he had suffered.

I wish there was an instructional manual in how to deal with this kind of loss.

‘He never talked about (the previous 
crash) one time,’ Canterbury School basketball coach Dan Kline said. 
‘I'm sure he carried it inside.’

‘He's a very mature young man (and) 
you'd never know he was 16 years old,’ Mr Kline said, adding he is 
someone ‘who can handle things'.

‘Right now, (the team) are just trying to collect our thoughts and stick together,’ Mr Kline said. ‘They're a close-knit group.’

David Bojrab, Dr Hatch's close 
friend and business partner, said in 2011 that he loved flying so much he felt 'compelled' to continue, even after his wife and children died in 2003.

Dr Bojrab said: 'He was such a strong 
proponent of flying and teaching people to fly ... I think he felt 
compelled to continue his passion.

'He felt compelled to show people that accidents do happen. He didn't want people to look in the other direction.'

He described Austin as 'the apple of his dad's eye', and said Dr Hatch took great pride in his son's athletic prowess.

Dr Bojrab said his friend had planned
to go to Spain to celebrate his parents' 50th wedding anniversary with 
the rest of his family, but he cancelled the trip to spend time with 
Austin and his adult stepchildren.

He said: 'Steve was a very big family man.'

Terrible twist: Dr Stephen Hatch died in a plane crash in 2011 - eight years after he survived a deadly smash that killed his wife and two children

A federal report into the 2003 crash found inaccurate pre-flight planning resulted in the plane not having enough fuel.

The National Transportation Safety 
Board also ruled that a utility pole the airplane hit during its forced 
landing, a low ceiling and dark night also contributed to the crash.

But Dr Bojrab said his friend disputed the report's findings, believing equipment failure caused the crash.

He said: 'When he crashed, it was an inferno, which makes you wonder how he could have been out of gas.'
