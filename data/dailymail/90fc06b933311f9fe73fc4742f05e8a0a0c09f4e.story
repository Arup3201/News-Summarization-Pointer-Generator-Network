Australians have already spent over $280 million on weight-loss products this year, with 75% of individuals admitting it is in the hope of becoming 'skinny'.

But when it comes to being skinny, just how healthy is it? 1 in 4 skinny people have pre-diabetes and are 'metabolically obese', making 'Skinny Fat' one of the fastest growing medical conditions. 

Also termed Metabolically Obese Normal Weight (MONW) it is used to describe a person who is in an ideal weight range but has more body fat than is healthy.

These people are slim, but are not fit and do not have healthy habits.

People who are skinny, despite poor diets and a lack of exercise, are referred to as 'Skinny Fat'

Although someone may appear healthy on the inside, they may be very unhealthy on the inside

A person's health choices should not be determined by their appearance. It is unsafe to assume that looking slim and healthy ensures a person is well

'Most people don't realise that there can be health complications to being thin,' said Sheila Zhou, expert Scientist at USANA.

'Being 'Skinny Fat' puts your body under a huge amount of pressure, including added fat around your organs, high cholesterol, and poor blood circulation.'

A lot of slim people in Australia sacrifice their health for the sake of their appearance.

'People’s intentions are often in the wrong place when they want to lose weight,' said Ms Zhou.

'Their aim is to be skinny, rather than to be healthy.' 

'As a result, they have a lack of fitness and a lack of muscle mass.'

Often, the problem is that a person does not eat a balanced diet or exercise because they aim to be skinny, rather than fit. The problem is also caused when a person has a fast metabolism

A person can also be skinny fat if they naturally have a fast metabolism, so do not feel the need to eat well or exercise because they are slim and appear to be healthy.

'If someone doesn’t have muscle, in the long term they are more likely to develop insulin resistance and are at risk of developing diabetes.' 

Startling statistics show that people with diabetes who are skinny fat have a higher mortality rate than obese diabetics.

'The problem with ‘skinny fat’ is that when people are thin, they think they are healthy and don’t realise they have a problem,' said Ms Zhou. 

'Skinny fat' people need to make sure they regularly visit their doctor, particularly to check their blood sugar levels and lipid profile

'Diabetes develops over a period of ten to thirty years, but sometimes people don’t know until they are diagnosed with diabetes or pre-diabetes. 

'It’s important they have regular check ups, particularly to check their lipid profile and blood sugar levels.'

People who are skinny fat, or even people who are struggling to become healthy, are likely to be making five big mistakes. 

Running, artificial sweeteners and not eating carbs are three big mistakes people might be making that are making them 'fat on the inside'.

1. Put down the bubbles

It doesn't sound like much, but saying goodbye to your favourite soft drink can help rid your body of dangerous toxins. 

The artificial sweeteners in soft drinks mess with your body's chemicals and their processes, therefore altering your metabolism. 

Even diet soft drink is just as bad for your health as fried food, so there is no escape!

2. Pump more iron

As 'Skinny Fat' is essentially too much fat and not enough muscle, weight training is an effective and simple solution. 

Strength training causes your body to keep the lean muscle, instead of using it as fuel. 

Weights also activate core muscles, which help organ function. 

So, put your runners away and start on those reps.

3. Refuel your oil tank

 Sound fishy? It's not! Even though most of us think oily foods are unhealthy, it is actually the opposite. 

Omega-3 fat rich foods such as salmon and sardines are delicious ways to reduce blood pressure and stabilize cholesterol.

4. Put the kettle on

Stress is one of the main causes of 'Skinny Fat', but never fear, rather than quitting your job, the solution is as simple as drinking more tea! 

Research shows tea heightens emotions of relaxation, and lowers our levels of cortisol after a stressful task. 

So swap the coffee for tea and you are already one step closer to being a picture of health!

5. Sleep away the cravings

Everyone loves sleep, but how many of us actually get the required 7 to 8 hours a night? 

If you ever needed an excuse, this is it. It's been scientifically proven that sleep deprivation alters your metabolism and increases cravings for carbs and sugar. 

So there's no need to ever feel guilt about wanting an early night; you're actually losing fat from it.

'To limit any food group or nutrients, be it carbs, fats or proteins, is bad for you,' said Ms Zhou. 

'Carbohydrates should make up 50 to 65 per cent of a person’s diet, but it does vary according to a person’s activity level. 

'You should not cut out carbohydrates. It's all about a balanced diet'

People should be selective about the types of carbohydrates they consume instead. 

'You should avoid highly processed or refined carbs like white bread or rice, and eat wholemeal, wholegrain as well as brown, red and black rice,' said Ms Zhou.

It's been scientifically proven that sleep deprivation alters your metabolism and increases cravings for carbs and sugar. You will lose fat if you sleep more

Although running and other aerobic exercise is fantastic for a person's cardiovascular health, it is crucial that a person uses weights for ultimate inner health.

'However, weightlifting and weight training is really important to increase muscle mass, flexibility and the strength of the muscles,' said Ms Zhou.

'As you get older, muscle mass gradually declines, so the chance of getting diabetes will increase.'  

There are simple ways for a person to get their health back on track - so simple that one of the best methods is sleep.

'A lack of sleep stimulates the production of a stress hormone called cortisol.,

Cortisol causes issues like overeating, increased abdominal fat and decreased muscle tissue.

According to studies, people who lack sleep tend to put on weight more than people with normal sleep patterns and crave carbs, sugar and unhealthy foods.'

And good news for coffee lovers! Ms Zhou says coffee has been prove to have health benefits.  

'Coffee does provide a certain health benefit in moderation.  

'Studies have shown that it can be good for cardiovascular health, oxidants, and some suggest help improve cognitive function.' 

Although walking, running, swimming and other aerobic exercises are great for your cardiovascular health, it is crucial that a person also does weights and strength work for their health
