Model Lauren Scruggs has spoken out for the first time since her left eye and arm were sliced off after she walked into a plane propeller in December - and has revealed her amazing recovery.

The 24-year-old fashion blogger showed off her new eye on television for the first time since the accident in Dallas, Texas and remained characteristically upbeat about the life-changing experience.

'Emotionally days are hard sometimes - just accepting the loss of my eye and hand - but it gets better,' she told the Today show from their broadcast at the London Olympics.

'I've realised God's in control of my life and there's a purpose in this story... I've gained a new perspective. I'm learning to live by faith and not by sight. I'm feeling good.'

Lauren, who also showed off her new prosthetic left arm, said she wanted to speak out to assure people she was on the road to recovery and to offer a message of hope to others.

'I just know that a lot of people have been following this story... and it's just good to be out in public as I am, letting people know that I'm doing okay and healing up,' she said.

Of the accident, she said she could only recall very little.

Inspiration: Lauren, who is in London for the Olympics, said she was inspired by the perseverance of gold-meal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who made an appearance to meet the model

Support: Gabby said she was excited to hear she had inspired Lauren and her recovery

At ease: Lauren laughed with the teen champion, who wished her the best in her recovery

Lauren almost lost her life when she 
walked into a plane propeller after taking a short flight in a family 
friend's aircraft to see the Dallas Christmas lights from the sky on 
December 3.

As well as injuries to her face and arm, she suffered a fractured skull, a broken collarbone and brain injuries. Doctors announced they would have to remove her eye two weeks later.

'I remember
my feet touching the ground, getting out of the plane, but that's all I
remember,' she said, adding that she would go into further detail in 
her upcoming autobiography, Still Lolo.

'It
was really healing for me personally just to talk about the accident,' 
she said of writing the book. 'I've gained a new perspective of life and
I feel like I need to use my message of hope and healing to inspire 
others just like others have inspired me.'

When
asked who she was inspired by at the Olympics, Lauren named Gabby 
Douglas, the first African-American to win gymnastics gold. The teen 
sensation also won gold with Team USA.

Fan: Former Olympic gymnast Shawn Johnson tweeted about meeting Lauren and snapped this picture

The admission cued a special guest - as Douglas joined Lauren to pass on her well wishes.

'I just have to say this means so much,' Douglas said with her trademark grin.
'I'm so 
happy and so excited for you and all that you've overcome. Keep staying 
strong and you'll keep shining.'

Lauren looked thrilled to meet the Olympian and added: 'I think she's a doll!'

Her
upbeat attitude on Today will come as little surprise to Lauren's 
legions of fans, who have followed her recovery and Twitter updates, as 
well as her determination to lead a normal life.

Since
the accident, she has learned to drive a shift stick car in spite of 
the physical challenges that come along with such a task before she had 
her prosthetic limb in place.

She has also made the most of her 
summer, Tweeting to her more than 12,500 followers that she 'surfed the 
afternoon away' during a 'great day' in late June.

Scruggs
released the cover to her upcoming autobiography last month, a 
testament to the fact that she is moving on with her life.

Her parents confirmed in April that Scruggs was working with a journalist to help her write about the life-changing incident.

On May 15, Ms Scruggs tweeted a picture of the cover, and affirmed her ever-present Christian faith has played a guiding role in her recovery.

She wrote: 'Humbled & thankful to share the journey God has chosen 4 me. Hope it helps others learn, as I have, that He is enough.'

In the memoir, entitled Still Lolo, Ms Scruggs will write alongside New York Times writer Marcus Brotherton about that fateful night of December 3, 2011.

The book deal, whose value is still unknown, is not the only financial gain that Ms Scruggs will be receiving out of the incident.

It is rumoured that she settled with the planeâ€™s insurance company for more than $1million.

According to the Courthouse News Service, the plane which injured the model was insured by Aggressive Insurance Services, along with a separate plane owned by the pilot Curt Richmond, a friend of the Scruggs family from Dallas, Texas.
