The young boy who made global headlines four years ago at the center of the infamous ‘Balloon Boy’ hoax is now fronting a heavy metal band with his two older brothers.

In 2009, six-year-old Falcon Heene was at the center of a media storm after his parents claimed he had boarded a homemade helium-filled flying saucer which had broken free of its restraints and floated away.

TV cameras captured the frantic chase, until the silver balloon dramatically touched down and the young boy was nowhere to be found.

Young rocker: Four years on from the 'Balloon Boy' hoax Falcon Heene is fronting the 'world's youngest heavy metal band'

Falcon Heene was just six-years-old in 2009 when father Richard claimed his son had been carried away in a helium balloon

It later turned out Falcon had been hiding in the family garage in Fort Collins, Colorado and parents Richard and Mayumi Heene confessed they had invented the whole tale in a bid to attract interest in a reality TV show about their family.

With a traumatic experience like that under his belt and still only ten-years-old, it perhaps isn’t that surprising that young Falcon now appears to have grown into an angsty young boy who has chosen to express himself through the medium of heavy metal music.

Four years on from the balloon incident young Falcon is fronting the Heene Boyz, the self-proclaimed 'World's Youngest Metal Band.'

The power trio consist of Falcon on vocals and bass, Bradford Heene, 13, on guitar, and Ryo Heene, 12, on drums are playing New York's Sullivan Hall later this month as they celebrate the launch of their second album 'American Chili'.

It is described on their website as 'a 
comedy horror about the last place for 100 miles to get gas in the 
middle of the desert between Los Angles and Las Vegas. For some people 
who stop to eat the world famous chili, it will be their last stop.'

The band don't shy away from their 
hoax-related past and their website proudly makes reference to their 
'storm chase adventures', plus appearances on TV show Wife Swap.

The
website also claims that Falcon 'was born with an unusually high pitch 
voice that is unique and adds to the metal sound of the band.' However 
that might just be because his voice hasn’t broken yet.

The band list their musical influences as 'Iron
Maiden, Black Sabbath, Dio, Metallica, to Disturbed, Linkin Park, Van 
Halen and most everything else that is Metal.'

It is safe to say the Heenes aren’t your
typical American family. After the balloon incident, Richard Heene was 
sentenced to 90 days in jail after pleading guilty to a charge of 
attempting to influence a public servant.

Mom Mayumi Heene was sentenced to 20 days of jail and the couple were ordered to pay $36,000 in restitution.

Commentators branded Heene 'a shameless self-promoter who would do almost anything to advance his latest endeavor'.

After that incident the family moved from Colorado to Florida - where Richard Heene and his family have been supposedly trying to put the 'Balloon Boy' scandal behind them.

But since then Richard Heene has unveiled several further attempts to win fame and wealth. In 2011 he launched an idea for a bizarre lifting machine for trucks, while he currently advertises a back scratching device called 'Bear Scratch,' through a campaign on YouTube.

Heene Boyz looks like just the latest vehicle from Richard Heene in an attempt to get his family noticed.
