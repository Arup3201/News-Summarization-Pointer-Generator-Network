Roma have slapped a £50million price tag on in-demand defender Medhi Benatia.

The Morocco international has attracted interest from the likes of Barcelona and Chelsea - while Manchester City had a £16.5million offer rejected on Friday.

The Premier League champions are also interested in Porto's French defender Eliaquim Mangala, although he is believed to prefer a move to Chelsea.

Benatia has been fined by Roma for publicly criticising their latest contract offer, accusing the club of treating him 'like a child' after being offered what he considered an 'unacceptable' pay rise.

However, club director Walter Sabatini insists the 27-year-old will not be allowed to leave for less than 61million Euros (£50million).

Speaking on Roma's official website, Sabatini said: 'Mehdi is a great player with a contract that expires in four years' time. We have no problem with him.

'Perhaps he slipped up with a few comments or words but he didn't intend to distance himself from Roma or the fans. He mentioned broken promises. That's not exactly how it went. It's true that when he signed for Roma he turned down other offers that were higher than ours.

'I said to him: 'You try and play like Benatia and we'll give you an improved contract.' We offered him an increase -- although there was no obligation for us to do so -- and we didn't agree on the amount, but he didn't mean to describe it as 'ridiculous.' He's speaking a language that's not his own -- you can't slaughter him for it.'

Sabatini stressed that Benatia would stay at Roma and accused the player's agent, Moussa Sissoko, of creating problems.

'I'd like to remind this man that 30 million is the price I believe Benatia's weak foot to be worth, his left. His right foot is worth at least a million more. So you do the maths.'

'As I've said, the player is not for sale, but if his agent wants to speculate on a price for him, then any clubs who are interested should consider him to be worth 61 million.

'If someone were to offer that amount, then I don't think I could guarantee that he would stay 100 percent.'
