Not appy: Traffic app Waze warns drivers when police are nearby

Google is being put under pressure to turn off  a police-tracking function in its traffic app Waze, following fears it might put officers' lives at risk.

Waze is a GPS navigation app that also warns drivers about congestion, car accidents, speed cameras, and when the police is nearby

Waze, which Google purchased for $966 million in 2013, has 50million users in 200 countries, a number which is growing. 

However, several police officers say the app is being used to stalk and plan attacks on law enforcement.

There are no known connections between any attack on police and Waze, but senior officers have said it's only a matter of time and are seeking support among law enforcement trade groups to pressure Google.

Sheriff Mike Brown of Bedford County, Virginia, said the police-reporting feature presents a danger to officers.

'The police community needs to coordinate an effort to have Google act like the responsible corporate citizen they have always been and remove this feature from the application even before any litigation or statutory action,' Sheriff Brown told the National Sheriffs Association (NSA).

Sheriff Brown, chairman of the NSA technology committee, and Sergio Kopelev, a reserve deputy sheriff in California, raised concerns during the meeting of the NSA's winter conference in Washington.

They pointed to the Instagram account of the man accused of fatally shooting two New York Police Department officers last month. 

Ismaaiyl Brinsley posted a screenshot from Waze along with messages threatening police.

Investigators do not believe he used Waze to ambush the officers, in part because police say Brinsley tossed his cellphone far from where he shot the officers.

The executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, Jim Pasco, said his organization has concerns.

The emerging policy debate places Google again at the center of a global debate about public safety, consumer rights and privacy.

Waze users mark police presence on maps without much distinction other than 'visible' or 'hidden'

Waze users mark police presence on maps without much distinction other than 'visible' or 'hidden.' 

Users see a police icon, but it's not immediately clear whether police are there for a speed trap, a sobriety check or a lunch break.

A Waze spokeswoman, Julie Mossler, said the company works with the New York Police Department and others around the world.

'These relationships keep citizens safe, promote faster emergency response and help alleviate traffic congestion,' Mossler said.

Google has declined to comment.

Google has a complicated relationship with government and law enforcement. The company is regularly compelled to turn over to police worldwide copies of emails or other information about its customers.

Last year, after disclosures that the National Security Agency had illicitly broken into Google's overseas Internet communication lines, Google and other technology companies rolled out encryption for users, which the U.S. government said could hamper law enforcement investigations.

Nuala O'Connor, head of the Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington civil liberties group, said it would not be appropriate for Google to disable the police-reporting feature.

'I do not think it is legitimate to ask a person-to-person communication to cease simply because it reports on publicly visible law enforcement,' she said.

She said a bigger concern among privacy advocates is how much information about customers Waze shares with law enforcement, since the service monitors their location continually as long as it's turned on.
