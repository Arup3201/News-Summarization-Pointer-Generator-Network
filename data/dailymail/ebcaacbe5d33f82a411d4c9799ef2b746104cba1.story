Shocked: Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said the scale of the problem was 'staggering'

Celebrities, small firms and large corporations are among those robbing Britain of around £5billion of tax revenue every year, a damning report reveals today.

The investigation, by the National Audit Office, lays bare the ‘staggering’ scale of tax avoidance – and warns that HM Revenue and Customs is struggling to control the epidemic.

The Government spending watchdog says some 2,289 tax avoidance schemes have been disclosed to HMRC by experts over the last eight years.

But Amyas Morse, head of the NAO, said the disclosure regime, introduced in 2004, ‘has had little impact on the persistent use of highly contrived schemes which deprive the public purse of billions of pounds’.

Tax avoidance is legal while tax evasion, which involves fraud or deliberate concealment, is not.

According to HMRC’s own definition, tax avoidance is ‘using the tax law to get a tax advantage that Parliament never intended’.

But the report reveals how HMRC wins more than eight in ten tax avoidance cases which end up in court, a sign of how tax experts are stretching the law to the point of absurdity.

It is currently investigating around 41,000 tax avoidance cases among small firms and individuals – but about 15 per cent have been under investigation for between five and ten years.

And it warns these 41,000 cases are estimated to have avoided a total of £10.2billion in tax over several years.

Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP and chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, said: ‘The scale of the problem is staggering.

'People who pay their taxes promptly and in full will be dismayed to discover that the enormous level of tax avoidance taking place is overwhelming HMRC’s efforts to combat it.’

She said it was ‘particularly galling’ that taxes are not being paid at a time when the Government’s austerity drive is hitting essential services.

Mrs Hodge said: ‘My concern is that without a credible plan to resolve these cases and to stamp out future avoidance, the public will lose confidence in the tax system’s ability to collect even-handedly what is due from all individuals and companies.’

The NAO report reveals the top five ‘mass marketed’ tax avoidance schemes alone have around 40,900 ‘users’ among small firms and individuals.

Questions: Big businesses, such as Google, Starbucks (pictured) and Amazon, are caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay

Big businesses, such as Google, Starbucks and Amazon, are also caught up in a growing scandal about the amount of tax that they pay.

To make matters worse, the report says HMRC is likely to ‘understate the true scale of avoidance’, and says the problem could be even larger.

It raised fears about specialist firms, dubbed ‘tax boutiques’, which exist solely for the purpose of helping people to avoid paying tax.

The report reveals how they ‘stretch the rules to the limit and will typically exist only to invent and administer avoidance schemes.’

In each of the last four years, accountants and other  tax avoidance experts have ‘disclosed’ more than 118 new tax avoidance schemes to HMRC every single year.

Since 2004 when the disclosure regime was introduced, HMRC has applied to tax tribunals against firms for not complying with the rules just 11 times. The maximum penalty is just £5,000.

The number of tax avoidance cases which it brings to court is equally paltry. Between April 2010 and October 2012, just 110 cases went to court.

An HMRC spokesman said: ‘HMRC has successfully challenged over 40 tax avoidance schemes through the courts in the last two years alone, successfully disrupting the avoidance industry through a combination of legal challenge and improved intelligence on  new schemes, and protecting around £4billion.’
