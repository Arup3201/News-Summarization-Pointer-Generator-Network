Formula One driver Nico Rosberg is clearly determined to capture the World Championship he narrowly missed out on last season with some intense pre-season training.

The German was just beaten to the F1 title by Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton last year by a margin of 67 points following the final race showdown in Abu Dhabi.

In an attempt to reverse those fortunes Rosberg headed hiking to make sure he is at peak fitness for his title assault, with the new F1 season beginning at the Australian Grand Prix on March 15.

Rosberg posted a series of pictures on his Instagram and Twitter accounts showing his hiking exploits on Tuesday.

The pictures were captioned by Rosberg saying: ‘Did some hiking yesterday with Dan. 1000m altitude 10km distance. Challenging route but totally worth it. What a view!’

The German has spoken of his determination to overcome Hamilton and one key area he will need to focus on will be his inability to convert pole positions into victories.

Rosberg obtained 11 pole positions in 2014, winning just five Grand Prixs whereas Hamilton won 11 races en route to the title off the back of seven poles.

However it was rivals Ferrari, with four-time World Champion Sebastian Vettel in their new car, who were fastest in the first three days of winter testing in Jerez last week.
