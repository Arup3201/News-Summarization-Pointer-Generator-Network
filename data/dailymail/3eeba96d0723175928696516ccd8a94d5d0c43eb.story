Toyota Motor Corp has recalled a further 57,000 cars to replace potentially deadly air bags.

They are among 16 million vehicles recalled worldwide since 2008 over the faulty inflators made by Takata Corp.

And the number will almost certainly rocket up as US safety regulators have urged Takata to issue a nationwide recall of driver-side air bags, rather than targeting humid areas where the inflators are thought to be more dangerous.

It comes after Honda Motor Co issued a similar recall two weeks ago following a fifth death related to Takata's inflator.

Mass recall: More than 50,000 Toyota cars have been recalled after a fifth death caused by an air bag

The fault is caused by a water leak in the air conditioning unit which could cause water to seep into other parts of the car causing circuits to short and unexpected malfunctions to occur. 

Toyota said that the airbag control module is one area which could be affected with the safety device becoming 'disabled or could inadvertently deploy'.

In a few cases the power steering function could be disabled, they said.

In October 2013, more than 850,000 vehicles including Camrys, the Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza which were made in 2012 and 2013 were recalled.

The majority of the original recall involved cars in North America.

On Thursday, Toyota revealed the Vitz, or Yaris, model made between 2002 and 2004 would be recalled in a number of markets.

Fears: US safety regulators have urged the inflator manufacturer Takata to recall more American cars

About 40,000 are in Japan, 6,000 in Europe and the rest in other markets outside North America. Toyota said it was not aware of any injury or death related to the recall. 

Separately, Toyota's small-car subsidiary Daihatsu Motor Co also issued a recall, in Japan, of 27,571 Mira minivehicles produced between December 2002 and May 2003 for the same reason - its first recall involving Takata inflators.

About 2.6 million vehicles have been recalled in Japan so far for Takata's air bag inflators, a transport ministry official said. 

Takata has so far resisted expanding the recall, saying that could divert replacement parts away from the high-humidity regions that need them most.
