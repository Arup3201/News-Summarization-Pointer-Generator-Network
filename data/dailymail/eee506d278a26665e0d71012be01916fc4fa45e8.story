Mysterious ‘blobs’ in cells have eluded scientists’ understanding since they were first discovered 50 years ago.

Now, US experts have called on the scientific community to up their efforts in determining their function, as the ‘blobs’ could play a key role in diseases such as cancer.

The strange cloudy structures, known as ‘assemblages’, consist of shifting collections of proteins.

Despite their existence being known since the invention of the electron microscope half a century ago, scientists still have no idea why they are there.

Two American experts are now calling on colleagues around the world to step up research on the 'blobs' in the hope of opening up new avenues for treating disease.

Professor Jeffrey Toretsky, from Georgetown University in Washington DC, said: ‘I want to know what these assemblages are doing in Ewing sarcoma, the disease I concentrate on - and I would think all other researchers who study human biology would want to know their functions in both health and disease.’

Together with Professor Peter Wright, from The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, he compiled an overview of what is known about assemblages and published it in the Journal of Cell biology.

The ‘blobs’ are often - but not always - made up of intrinsically disordered proteins, they wrote.

Unlike most proteins, they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules, a bit like a lock and key.

'Blobs' can be found in animal cells.

They are described as strange cloudy clusters known as 'assemblages,' which consist of shifting collections of proteins.

Unlike most proteins, they do not assume a specific shape that fits certain other molecules, a bit like a lock and key.

Scientists are unsure of their function, despite studying them for 50 years.

They seem to seek each other out and form gel-like structures.

The ‘assemblages’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even RNA - a close relative of DNA that helps decode and regulate genes.

This is why experts suspect that blobs could play a key role in diseases such as cancer. 

Molecular binding between lock-like ‘receptor’ proteins and key-like ‘ligands’ that fit them, drives a number of biological processes, including fundamental elements of the immune system. 

While the purpose of the ‘blob’ proteins is not clear, they are far from inert.

In an apparently purposeful way, they seem to seek each other out and form gel-like structures.

The resulting ‘assemblages’ can trap and interact with other proteins and even RNA - a close relative of DNA that helps decode and regulate genes.

‘It is only in the last five years that researchers have begun recognising that proteins without fixed structures may have important transitional properties that change based upon their local abundance in cells,’ Professor Toretsky explained.

If the blobs play a role in disease, it might be possible to target them with a small-molecule drug, the scientists believe.

Professor Toretsky said: ‘Current drug-discovery dogma suggests that it is very hard to make a small molecule to prevent two structured proteins from interacting.

‘However, small molecules have a greater likelihood of disrupting intrinsically disordered protein-protein interactions.

‘This review links together very basic biologic phenomena of protein interaction with the potential for new drug discovery. It’s an exciting challenge.’
