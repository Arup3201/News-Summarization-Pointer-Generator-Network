Manchester City will welcome winger Samir Nasri back in to their squad for the Capital One Cup tie with Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium.

Nasri has not played since damaging his groin in the Champions League loss at Bayern Munich on September 17.

But the French international is back in contention after making a quicker than expected recovery.

'Nasri is working and is in the squad list,' said City boss Manuel Pellegrini. 'I don't know if he will play. I will decide tomorrow.'

Frank Lampard is the only player unavailable to the Chilean due to a thigh muscle strain. The former Chelsea midfielder is also expected to be ruled out of Sunday's Manchester derby against bitter rivals United.  

Nasri's return would provide a welcome boost after Saturday's shock 2-1 defeat at West Ham left the Premier League champions third in the table and six points behind leaders Chelsea.

'We are disappointed,' admitted Pellegrini. 'West Ham played well but we didn't deserve to lose. We didn’t convert the chances.

'All the other teams will drop points. Every point you drop makes it harder but last season we were quite a few points behind as well. There are many points left and we just want to fight for them.'

Saturday saw City's second league defeat in nine games this season. Despite also struggling to qualify from their Champions League group, Pellegrini insisted that his side had not been worked out by the opposition.

'We have to analyse the Champions League after the group, not now. The Premier League last year was exactly the same. People criticised us and said we had to change and that we didn’t know how to play away. We won four from the first 18 points away last season. Things change but we know we have to improve.'

Nasri was man of the match as City beat Sunderland at Wembley to lift the Capital One Cup in March, and while Pellegrini admits the club have other priorities this season he will not neglect to defend the silverware.

'It’s important for the club to win trophies, it doesn’t matter which one. We want to be involved in all four but winning a competition at Wembley – the most important stadium in the world – in front of 80,000 people who were singing was special.

'I tell the players to try to win every game. We don’t have to say which competition is most important. Of course we would prefer to win the Premier League but that doesn’t mean we don’t want to win the Capital One Cup because we do.' 

Pellegrini also received a personal boost when he was named on FIFA's 10-man shortlist for the World Coach of the Year award.

Chelsea's Jose Mourinho and Manchester United's Louis van Gaal are among the other managers up for the gong, but will face stiff competition from the likes of World Cup-winning Germany manager Joachim Low and Real Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti.

'I heard today,' said Pellegrini. 'Normally it is the coaches that win the big leagues that are nominated and those that win the World Cup. That’s what happens. Of course it's nice but it's nicer to win the league here.'
