David Cameron’s failure to take military action against Syria may have cost Britain a £6billion deal to sell fighter jets to the United Arab Emirates, experts claimed last night.

The Prime Minister faced a massive snub when the oil-rich Gulf state suddenly pulled the plug on plans to buy 60 Eurofighter Typhoons from defence giant BAe Systems on Thursday.

Following a year of talks, the aerospace firm admitted the UAE had ‘elected not to proceed’ on the purchase of a range of defence and security equipment.

No deal: David Cameron flew out to the UAE to convince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to go ahead with a deal with BAe, but did not succeed

The decision was a blow for Mr Cameron, who flew to Dubai last month to persuade crown prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to buy the warplanes, which are also in service with the RAF.

Defence analysts said the Government had paid the price for failing to be ‘robust’ over Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad, who killed more than 1,400 civilians in a chemical weapon attack in a bid to crush pro-democracy rebels.

In August, Mr Cameron suffered a humiliating Commons defeat over plans for missile strikes on Syria - seen as a grave threat to Middle East stability.

But inaction by Downing Street over Damascus - and Iran’s nuclear ambitions - fuelled concerns in the Gulf about the UK’s long-term commitment to the region’s stability.

Dr John Louth, of the Royal United Services Institute think-tank, said: ‘Britain didn’t really do a great deal in relation to Syria and this may have undermined [the UAE’s] confidence.

But Dr Louth suggested the lucrative contract might not be ‘dead in the water’ because the UAE still needed fighter jets. ‘I wouldn’t be surprised if there was a deal on this in the next year,’ he added.

However, Keith Hayward, of the Royal Aeronautical Society, said: ‘All sorts of things can affect these deals and not just to do with the quality of the aircraft concerned.’

UAE military chiefs are said to prefer the Typhoon following its performance in Libya during the 2011 campaign to oust Colonel Gaddafi.

The decision to axe the deal was a blow to BAe Systems, which has been increasingly eyeing overseas sales to offset declining Ministry of Defence budgets.

It raised fears that the firm, which makes the aircraft in collaboration with European group EADS and Italy’s Finmeccanica, could be beaten to the contract by France’s Dassault Aviation, manufacturer of the rival Rafale fighter.

Last year the aerospace manufacturer lost out to Dassault to supply 126 jets to India – although the final negotiations were marred by bribery accusations when a manager was accused of paying about £250 to an official for providing a better site to exhibit its products at an air show.

The French also have an airbase near Abu Dhabi and the UAE has an existing fleet of French-built Mirage 2000-9 warplanes.

The Rafale fighter is cheaper than the Typhoon but is considered not as capable.

Howard Wheeldon, an independent defence analyst, said the French are not ‘in this race’.

‘This is a campaign that has not been lost but it has not been won. Nobody else has won this deal – it has essentially gone away,’ he said.

A Number 10 source said the deal was ‘always going to be a tricky one’ because the UAE has been in talks with France for a long time and the Typhoon entered the process quite late in the process.

A government spokesman added: ‘It was always going to be a difficult deal to do. And as BAe have said, it was an exciting prospect but not part of their business plan.’

BAe assembles Typhoons for the RAF and for Saudi Arabia at its plant in Warton, Lancashire, where it employs more than 5,000 workers.
