The father of two who died after crashing his exotic sports-car into a power pole at high speed has been remembered by his friends as the sort of person who 'would do anything for his mates.'

George Kanalis died after he crashed his Lamborghini into a power pole in Sydney's west on Thursday night.

Steven Muhvich, one of Mr Kanalis' best mates, said the 42-year-old routinely helped out him and his father, according to Fairfax Media.

'He would do anything for me and my dad, I just don't know what happened to him,' Mr Muhvich said. 

'He's got drag cars and knows what he is doing. I think he just lost control.' 

Terrifying footage has emerged of the moment the Lamborghini lost control and slammed into the power pole.

CCTV footage has captured Mr Kanalis, from Glenhaven, north-west of Sydney driving at high speed through Hassall Street in Wetherill Park as he collided into a number of other vehicles.

Massive cloud of smoke and a trail of skid marks on the road suggests he spun out of lost after overtaking another vehicle before slamming into a pole about 6pm on Thursday.

Nearby workers and motorists were seen running towards the scene to help the father of two, who died at the scene after being trapped inside his dream car.

Distraught family and friends have returned to the scene to pay their respects as they gathered on Friday to lay flowers while others have paid tribute on social media.

One friend posted on Facebook: 'Thanks For the bourbon George. Rip mate.'

Another said: 'I grew up with George since 2nd grade at school we spent most of our teenage years good mate although I haven't seen him in a few years he was always there [sic].' 

A third friend wrote: 'One of life's great characters, you're right, taken way too soon. RIP'

While another said: 'He was a very unique person a true one of a kindRIP [sic] George my friend'
