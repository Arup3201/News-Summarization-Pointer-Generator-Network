Protest: Douglas Alexander, shadow secretary of state for international development, says England players should walk off if they are racially abused

England players should walk off in protest and abandon the match if any of them are racially abused during the Euro 2012 football competition, Labour said last night.

The unprecedented call for a pitch protest by Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander came amid a growing political row over the   tournament in Poland and Ukraine.

And the view received strong support in a snap poll, which suggested six out of ten backing players who walk off.

Mr Alexander said that if, as many fear, black England players are abused when the team plays Ukraine on Tuesday week, the match should be stopped – with the points awarded to England.

Ukraine and Poland should face similar sanctions to the sporting boycott of South Africa in apartheid days, Labour added.

Writing in today’s Mail on Sunday, Mr Alexander argues: ‘I support referees taking the strongest possible action in the face of racist abuse from the terraces. They have the power to stop the game should any racist incidents occur – they should use it and be backed by the governing body.

‘However, if a referee ignored blatant racist abuse, and the England players or their management felt they were justified in walking off, they should be supported in their action.

‘If either host country’s fans misbehave, the teams could be taken off by the referee with the home team forfeiting the points. Hopefully something like that might encourage players to challenge their supporters.’

Mr Alexander also called on David Cameron and the soccer authorities to back Labour’s tough stance: ‘The British Government should send a clear signal to Uefa that it wants racism to be dealt with swiftly and robustly.’

He was backed by fellow Labour front bencher Jim Murphy who said that as well as calling off matches, all Ukrainian and Polish players should start the next game with yellow cards to punish racist chants by fans. And they should be made to play behind closed doors.

Labour’s stance is in stark contrast to that of Michel Platini, president of UEFA, European soccer’s ruling body, who said players who walk off should be booked.

Pressed on the race row last week, he
 brushed it aside saying: ‘I don’t think there’s any more racism in 
Poland and Ukraine than in France or anywhere else, or even in England. 
It’s not a footballing problem. It’s a problem for society.’

Mr
 Alexander also accused Mr Cameron of ‘dithering and delay’ over his 
response to the jailing of Ukraine’s opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.

British
 Ministers are to boycott England matches in Ukraine in the group stages
 of the tournament, but have not ruled out attending if the team 
qualifies for the latter stages.

‘If England go all the way, Ukraine’s President Viktor Yanukovych should be left to stand and clap in the VIP section alone and not with David Cameron joking and cheering beside him,’ Mr Alexander said.

The snap poll which supported Labour’s view also found that only one in five opposed players walking off.

Similarly, half of voters said Ministers should boycott all games in Ukraine. Fewer than one in four disagree.

The
 Survation survey yesterday of 499 people is unweighted, and the figures
 do not necessarily reflect the views of the population as a whole.

Shadow Defence Secretary Mr Murphy compared the pitch protest plan to the sporting boycott of South Africa during the apartheid era.

He said: ‘There are some who still claim that sport and politics don’t mix, but they always have done and always will. We should celebrate the power of sport to influence societies.’

Downing Street last night refused to back Labour’s call  for players walking off, insisting it was up to football authorities to decide.

A spokesman also said there was no change in the ruling  on Ministers attending matches in Ukraine.
