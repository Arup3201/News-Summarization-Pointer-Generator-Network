The levels of consciousness experienced by patients in a vegetative is still a mystery.

But scientists are coming closer than ever to proving that patients locked in their body can understand their environment. 

Now a new study in Israel suggests people in a vegetative state can react emotionally to photographs of people they know personally,

Patients in a vegetative state may be able to recognise photographs of their loved ones, research reveals

Dr Haggai Sharon from Tel Aviv University, who led the research alongside Dr Yotam Pasternak, said: 'We showed that patients in a vegetative state can react differently to different stimuli in the environment depending on their emotional value.

'It's not a generic thing; it's personal and autobiographical. We engaged the person, the individual, inside the patient.'

The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, deepen our understanding of patients in comas and may offer hope for improved treatments.

For many years patients in a vegetative state were believed to have no awareness of self or environment.

However, in recent years doctors have use MRI scans of brain activity and discovered that some people can perform complex cognitive tasks on command like imagining a physical activity such as playing tennis.

In one case a patient was even able to answer 'yes' or 'no' questions.

In response to all the photographs an area of the brain responsible for facial recognition was activated, indicating that their brain knew they were looking at faces

In August, scientists were able to communicate with a patient who was thought to be in a vegetative state for the past 12 years.

Researchers in Canada used a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanner to look at the brain activity of a previously non-responsive patient while asking a series of set questions.

While inside the scanner, the patient answered several questions, such as ‘are you in a hospital? by concentrating on the specific words, ‘yes’ or ‘no’.

In this way, the patient reported that he knew what his name was and that he was in the hospital at the time of communication. 

‘This new technique takes communication with some patients who are assumed to be in a vegetative state to the next level,’ said researcher Adrian Owen.

‘It will make detecting who is conscious and who is not much faster and more reliable and for those who are conscious, communicating their wishes will be that much easier.’

In two different hospital visits, five months apart, the researchers were able to communicate with the patient but found that he was also aware of his environment, meaning he could maintain coherent thoughts and lead a rich mental life.

But these cases are rare and do not reveal whether or not a patient is having a personal emotional experience when they are in a vegetative state.

To gain insight into 'what it feels like to be in a vegetative state' they worked with four patients who were in a vegetative state, either persistent (month-long), or permanent (over three months).

The patients were shown photographs of people they did and did not personally know then gauged the patients' reactions using MRI, which measures blood flow in the brain to detect areas of neurological activity.

In response to all the photographs an area of the brain responsible for facial recognition was activated, indicating that their brain knew they were looking at faces.

However in response to the photographs of close family members and friends, areas of the brain associated with emotion and memory were also activated in the patients brains.

In other words the patients' emotional responses suggested that they recognised the people in the photographs.

The ability to register and categorise complex visual information and link it to memories is previously unheard of in vegetative patients.

However the researchers could not be sure if the patients were conscious of their emotions or just reacting spontaneously.

They asked patients to imagine their parents' faces.

A 60-year-old teacher who was hit by a car showed complex activity similar to that of a normal, healthy person.

Researchers believe she is evidence that vegetative patients can be 'emotionally aware'.

A second woman, 23, showed activity in just the emotion specific brain regions. Both women woke up within two months of the tests and did not remember being in a vegetative state.

'This experiment, a first of its kind, demonstrates that some vegetative patients may not only possess emotional awareness of the environment but also experience emotional awareness driven by internal processes, such as images,' said Dr Sharon.

The team believe their work could be a first step toward finding better treatment.
