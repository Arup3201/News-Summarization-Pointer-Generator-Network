Accused: Daniel Spencer, 59, allegedly killed his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire

A 'jealous' man murdered his ex-wife then hid her body inside her bed - where it lay undiscovered for three weeks, a court heard.

Daniel Spencer, 59, allegedly killed his former spouse Jane Wiggett, 57, at her home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire on July 24 last year.

Bristol Crown Court heard the father-of-two placed the grandmother’s body inside her bed, with pillows and blankets tucked around her.

A search party of friends and family gained entry to Ms Wiggett’s home two days later, after becoming concerned when she failed to turn up for appointments.

They looked around the property but did not spot the body as it was so well hidden beneath the 'carefully' made bed, a jury heard.

Spencer, of Prestbury Road, Cheltenham, allegedly told Ms Wiggett’s friends and family that she was on holiday in Penzance, Cornwall, and in contact with him.

But as weeks went on, suspicions began to build and Ms Wiggett was reported missing to police on August 15 - with officers discovering her body the following day.

The jury heard Spencer, who denies a charge of murdering Ms Wiggett, initially told police he would 'hand himself in' but then attempted to flee the country.

Richard Smith QC, prosecuting, told a jury of six men and six women, Ms Wiggett had remained friends with her husband despite their divorce 10 years ago.

'Jane Wiggett, you may consider, couldn’t live with this defendant but equally perhaps nor could she live entirely without him,” Mr Smith said.

'This was a jealous man. On Wednesday July 24 last year, this defendant visited his then ex-wife in her flat in Cheltenham. Something happened to anger him and upset him.

'There was something of a struggle. Jane Wiggett resisted, it seems, his attack upon her. But the defendant took her by the throat and this time it culminated in him taking her life.

'He put and left Jane’s body lying in her own bed, positioned on her back. Her face was covered with a pillow, her quilt was then carefully put over her as if to hide the fact that she was dead inside.'

Mr Smith said Spencer and Ms Wiggett had been married for 30 years, during which she twice reported him to the police for grabbing her by the throat.

The couple finally divorced in 2005 but stayed in close contact, living in the same area of Cheltenham and spending time with each other.

Mr Smith said Ms Wiggett, who weighed just seven-and-a-half stone, was last seen on the evening of July 24 - after which her phones and credit cards were not used.

'This defendant, knowing what he had done, set about doing his best to try in the first instance to cover up her absence,' the prosecutor said.

'A part of that cover up was to lie to people about where she was - he knew she was at home dead in her bed but he said his ex-wife had gone on a spontaneous holiday.

'He mentioned Cornwall and her being in contact with him on the telephone. It was a guise that all was well.'

Mr Smith said friends and family decided to visit Ms Wiggett on July 26 and gained access to her flat.

'They didn’t notice Jane’s body lying under the quilt and blanket, covered over with pillows, in her bed,' he said.

However, police were called at 7.48pm on August 15. Officers visited the flat at 3am the following morning and discovered the body.

A post-mortem examination found Ms Wiggett had been hit before her death, which was caused by strangulation.

Mr Smith said traces of Spencer’s blood were discovered under her fingernails and phone records showed he had not attempted to call her at any time after July 24.

Police contacted Spencer, who promised to 'hand himself in' but actually travelled up north before staying at a hotel near Birmingham airport under a false name, he added.

A member of staff at the hotel recognised Spencer from a police appeal and called officers, who arrested him on August 19.

'His passport was in his possession and at the ready,' Mr Smith said.

Spencer denies murder and the trial, expected to last for two weeks in front of Mr Justice Hamblen, continues.
