A Florida woman has been found guilty of locking her boyfriend's son in a cupboard and starving him and could now face up to 120 years behind bars.

Sharon Glass, 49, from Brevard, was found guilty on eight counts of aggravated child abuse on Friday after four days on trial.

She and her boyfriend Michael Marshall, 40, were arrested in 2012 after police found Marshall's 12-year-old son lying on the bathroom floor weighing just 40 pounds.

On Friday Glass told the court that she hadn't noticed the boy was emaciated because he was always wearing baggy jumpers.

She also claimed she had nothing to do with disciplining the boy, who was regularly locked in a cupboard and tied to a bed post.

She said she wanted to leave the relationship with Marshall, but that during the four years she dated him he threatened to kill her several times.

Marshall is currently in jail awaiting trial on similar charges.

During the trial the boy, now 14, described being starved nearly to death and locked in both a closet and a bathroom for days on end by his father and his father's girlfriend.

Looking far healthier than he did when he was rescued two years ago weighing just 40 pounds, the boy testified at Sharon Glass' child abuse trial Wednesday, softly recounting his time with the woman, who he first met in 2009 when he was in the third grade and she was dating his dad, Michael Marshall.

Giving short answers to the prosecutor's questions, he said Glass quickly moved into their home in Titusville, Florida and he began to call her 'mom.' But he soon started getting in trouble, beginning with the time Glass accused him of stealing an iPod, he told the court.

Abuse: A 14 year old boy, who has not been identified, has described being starved nearly to death and locked in a closet for days on end by his father and his father's girlfriend

Trial: The boy testified at the child abuse trial of Sharon Glass, pictured, on Wednesday

According to clickorlando.com, he testified
 he didn't take the gadget, but was later accused of stealing other 
things, and was severely punished for taking fruit off a tree and hiding
 food.

'I was constantly locked up,' the boy, who hasn't been identified, said.

He said he would escape when he was put in his room, leading Glass to threaten to leave Marshall if he didn't lock the boy up.

So
 the father did. The boy, without shedding a tear or changing his tone 
of voice, told the court they put him in a closet and secured the door 
with a bungee cord and a desk.

He even bravely illustrated with a laser pointer how they wrapped a cord around the knobs of the sliding closet doors to keep him inside.

When asked if Glass and Marshall would talk to him, he replied: 'Not unless they were telling me to be quiet, basically.'

They gave him diapers so they wouldn't have to let him out to use the bathroom and he was fed macaroni noodles, ramen noodles and sometimes canned vegetables.

When he was out of the closet he would take any food he could find and hide it, he said.

Bathroom: He was also locked in this bathroom

Numerous holidays passed when he was locked away, including Valentines Day, St. Patrick's Day and Easter. Later, he was locked in a bathroom after his father zip-tied him to the post of a bunk bed for three days and he chewed through the ropes to escape.

But he said on Christmas day in 2011 he was let out of the bathroom to watch other children who lived in the house open gifts. He was then put back inside with a stocking full of coal.

'I just cried,' he recounted.

He noticed himself getting smaller he said, and his clothes getting baggier. The court was shown a tiny pair of Spiderman pajamas, boys size 8, that he was found in and pictures showing a malnourished child with gaunt cheeks and skeletal ribs.

It wasn't until March 2012 that he was rescued from his hell, when a family friend raised the alarm.

At the time, investigators said another month of the alleged horrific abuse would have killed him.

Thankfully, there were no obvious signs of the trauma he endured when he appeared in court, now a teen, not yet 5-feet tall. He smiled at times and even laughed.

Making the case all the more horrific is the fact that teachers at the child's school first reported his injuries to authorities some 17 months before he was eventually rescued.

Distraught teachers at South Lake Elementary School said they repeatedly called the Department for Children and Families to try to get help for the boy, then aged 12. The abuse started while he was a pupil at the school.

The boy moved to Apollo Elementary School where he spent just 10 days in class before being withdrawn to be home-schooled.

Marshall and Glass were angered because he was getting extra food at school, police said.

About
 two months after taking him out, they told the district he would attend
 a private school - essentially stopping the district's efforts to keep 
track of him and his education.

'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade.

'I honestly thought the next call that I got about him was that he would be dead.'

Glass's ex-husband, Tony Glass, said he called DCF 12 times, concerned that his three children who lived with their mother were often dirty and had head lice.

'I called them so many times because of my concerns with the kids, they told me to stop calling,' he said.

'If you’re told by DCF to stop calling, what else can you do? Who else can you call?'

The last time the department looked into the complaints was 2010 when they decided there was not enough evidence to justify removing the boy from his father.

'There is a difference between reporting child abuse and reporting concern and being able to remove a child from their home,' DCF spokeswoman Carrie Hoeppner told MailOnline.

Speaking to Florida Today at the time she added: 'You can't remove a child on a hunch. Of all the resources we have, the one tool we don't have is a crystal ball.'

Begging for help: 'We tried, and we tried, and we begged,' said Ronda Rochon, the boy's teacher at the school he attended for third, fourth and fifth grade, of DCF

Action was eventually taken on March 15 when a woman walked into Titusville Police Department told officers her boyfriend had gone to a friend's home and had seen an emaciated boy locked in the bathroom.

Detectives went to the house and found the boy curled up on the floor.

Police said the boy would be zip-tied to a bed in a standing position and forced to sleep that way. To stop him from crying, a dirty sock was duct-taped in his mouth.

The couple arrived home while police were still at the property and reportedly confessed to caging and punishing the boy, including denying him food, according to Local 6 News.

They said they punished the boy because he began stealing food after it was being withheld from him, Titusville police said in the report.

Hospital staff said the condition of the child when he was found resembled images of  'concentration camp survivors.' He was severely malnourished and treated for dehydration.

The boy and two of his siblings have been in DCF custody since the ordeal.
