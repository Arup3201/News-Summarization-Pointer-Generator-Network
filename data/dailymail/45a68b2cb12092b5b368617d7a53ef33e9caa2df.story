A church minister who was investigated over claims he stripped and spanked three women in his office has been charged with a series of sex offences.

Reverend Howard Curtis, 71, a former senior minister at the Coulsdon Christian Fellowship, in Croydon, south London, was arrested in July last year over the alleged assaults.

They are alleged to have happened between 2006 and 2009, it has been revealed.

Mr Curtis, of Wallington, south London, has been charged with two counts of indecent assault, five counts of sexual assault and six counts of child cruelty.

The charges relate to offences against eight alleged victims between 1969 and 2012.

He denies the claims and has been bailed to appear at Croydon Magistrates' Court on October 31.

The church in Chipstead Valley Road describes itself as an 'independent charismatic Baptist church'. 

Mr Curtis retired from his position as senior minister in June 2013.
