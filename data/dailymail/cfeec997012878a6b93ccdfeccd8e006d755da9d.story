It was a big night for TV last night in the northeast, but a police department in Connecticut wants people to know that missing your favorite show isn't an emergency.

Between the Yankees-Red Sox baseball game on ESPN, the continuing saga of AMC’s Breaking Bad and the season finale of HBO’s True Blood, there was outrage when Cablevision’s Optimum service experienced a widespread outage.

Customers in southwestern Connecticut  were so distraught that people in Fairfield, Connecticut called 911 to voice their displeasure.

The final season: Breaking Bad has received widespread critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest TV dramas of all time

Outage then outrage: Residents of southwestern Connecticut were settling down to watch Sunday evenings episode when their cable provider blacked out

We are not amused: The Fairfield Police Department used its Facebook page to remind residents that missing a favorite TV show does not necessitate a call to 911

The police department was not amused by the consumer complaints.

The message on the department's Facebook page reads the outage is 'neither an emergency or a police related concern.'

“We are receiving numerous 911 calls regarding the Cablevision outage. This is neither an emergency or a police related concern. Please direct your inquiries to Cablevision. Misuse of the 911 system may result in an arrest.'

Many others released their frustration onto social media.

Cablevision said in a statement shortly after 11 p.m. that there was a commercial power outage in its Norwalk facility. It says 'the power matter has been resolved and service has been restored to our customers.'

For loyal viewers of Breaking Bad, the everyday story of a middle-aged chemistry teacher who is diagnosed with cancer and becomes a gun-toting drugs kingpin, every minute counts.

The show has just begun the second half of the concluding fifth series and is edging nearer to one of the most eagerly-awaited finales on the small screen since The Sopranos.
