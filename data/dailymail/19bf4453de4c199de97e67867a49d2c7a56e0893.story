Shin deep in mud and rain water and getting a soaking from a monsoon deluge, it's hard to fathom why these workers could possibly look so happy in their daily toil.

But far from being concerned about getting wet, these farmers are delighted that the heavens have opened.

For monsoon season signals the start of Nepal's main rice planting season - the source of the country's staple diet and the nation's main source of income.

The season is the most crucial time for Nepalese farmers to take to the paddy fields and plant rice saplings.

Know as the month of Asar, it usually falls during June and July in the country and coincides with the peak of Nepal's rainy season.

To the locals, planting the rice that will provide their main source of sustenance for the coming year - they eat it for lunch and dinner - is known as 'ropai', a Nepalese word that literally translates to 'cultivation' in English.

And the highlight of the busy month is undoubtedly a special festival, known as Asar 15, which this year falls on June 29.

Farmers, residents and tourists play in the mud, eat beaten rice, drink and enjoy traditional music as they hope that their annual celebration of ropai jatra - or the rice planting festival - will yield a healthy harvest come October.

Part of the celebration sees the farmers join in singing a traditional tune known as the asare song.

Rice production really is big business in Nepal.

Around half of Nepal's agricultural production centres around rice with almost 3,000 square miles of the country devoted to growing the cereal.

Some 75 per cent of the country's working population spends at least six months of the year farming rice and the average person consumes a staggering 78kg of rice every year.
