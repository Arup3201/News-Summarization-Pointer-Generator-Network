British holidaymakers have been named and shamed as the worst nationality for grabbing sunloungers – by Germans.

An investigation carried out in Spain found it was mainly people from the UK who were queuing up to reserve their spot for a day's sunbathing by the pool.

Christian Voss, 39, was standing in line at the Royal Star in Lloret de Mar at 7.30am when the line started to form.

Early birds: Apparently Brits are worse than German holidaymakers when it comes to reserving sunloungers

Working for German newspaper Bild, the investigations reporter said although the hotel had a wide variety of foreign tourists, it was the Brits who were standing in the queue for the sun loungers.

And he said that when the masses rushed inside to put towels down on the sun loungers and reserve them for the rest of the day, it was the British who were in the majority.

And that meant that while German guests were left standing when they turned up after breakfast, the British with their beach towels had already managed to nab the best places.

Voss spoke to dozens of British tourists about why they had been in such a rush to get the sun loungers and to stop others using them.

These included Manchester United fan Korban, 12, his mother Julie, 40, and her niece Danni, 19, from Malvern in Worcestershire.

And relax ... The investigation by a German newspaper found Brits queue up early to get hotel sunloungers

Julie said: 'I know there was some trouble yesterday after some of these people had their towels moved allegedly by Germans.

'But I was there and they weren't Germans, they were Frenchmen.'

English mechanic Darren, 43, from Exmouth, was on holiday at the hotel with his daughters Elouise, nine, and Daisy, seven.

He said: 'I was in the queue at the start. If you don't reserve a place you don't get a place. There are not enough to go around.'

Another family Carolina, 52, and husband Mark, 51, with their son Josh, 41, from Farnborough, were also spotted grabbing sun loungers and she said: 'I found out pretty quickly that the pool is only officially open at 9am but unofficially the door opens sooner than that.

'So you can get in if you join the queue and reserve a space. But there's no chance otherwise. Everyone else is doing it as well.'

Linda, 55, was photographed turning up with seven beach towels which she said were for her extended family.

Her daughter-in-law Eve, 28, who turned up a short while later said: 'If we want to sit together it's the only way to make sure we get a place.'
