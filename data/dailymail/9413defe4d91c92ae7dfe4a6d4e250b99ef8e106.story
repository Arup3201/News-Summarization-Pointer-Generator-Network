For many, the main family holiday comes after a year of saving and anticipation.

If you’re Coleen Rooney, however, almost every month seems to include its own exotic getaway.

In the year from September 2013, Wayne Rooney’s 28-year-old wife enjoyed nine holidays – approximately one every 40 days – including trips to Portugal, Dubai, Barbados and the US.

The fashion designer is believed to have covered around 60,000 miles travelling from the family’s £1.2million home in Macclesfield, Cheshire.

Mrs Rooney, who has a personal wealth of £14million on top of her footballer husband’s £60million fortune, has not been shy about sharing her exploits with her 1.19million Twitter followers.

Her jet-setting year started in Portugal last September when she and her husband stayed at the five-star Conrad Hotel in Quinta do Lago, Algarve, where a suite can cost up to £1,200 a night.

The couple enjoyed the beach with sons Kai, four, and Klay, one, as Rooney recovered from a head injury that ruled him out of playing for Manchester United or England.

Family time: With the football season over, Wayne was able to join Coleen, four-year-old Kai and Klay in Portugal for holiday number five. The couple celebrated their youngest son's first birthday on the trip

Mrs Rooney tweeted: ‘Just what I’ve needed ... Some quality time with my family after a hectic summer!!! Lovely few days.’ Less than a month later she and the children were on the beach again, this time in Barbados, where the Rooneys have a £5million six-bedroom villa with an infinity pool.

This time Mrs Rooney was joined by her parents, but her husband was busy elsewhere, helping England qualify for the World Cup.

A relatively long break from travelling saw Mrs Rooney stay closer to home, but by February the lure of the Caribbean had taken her back to Barbados. While Rooney was busy training, Mrs Rooney and her parents took Kai and Klay to the island during the half-term break. 

Sightseeing: While Wayne plays in the World Cup, Coleen poses by Christ the Redeemer in June. After England's early exit from the tournament, Mrs Rooney whisked the family to Las Vegas - her friends went too

April saw her take the children on a brief trip to Dubai although, with the Premier League season still in full flow, Rooney missed out again.

The following month Portugal was again the destination of choice and this time Rooney was there too as the family celebrated Klay’s first birthday on the trip.

With the World Cup held in Brazil this year and her husband at the heart of Roy Hodgson’s team, Mrs Rooney was always destined to make the trip to South America.

While most fans were in the country for the football, she also made sure she took in the sights, posting pictures of herself on the beach and at the statue of Christ the Redeemer.

Getaway: Holiday number eight for Mrs Rooney saw her having fun with Klay in Cyprus in August. Last week, Coleen left her husband and children at home as she shopped and saw a Beyonce and Jay-Z concert in Paris

After England’s early exit from the tournament, Mrs Rooney whisked the family off to Las Vegas. Although she was dismayed to find her luggage had been ransacked, she was later spotted partying with friends at the Encore Beach Club in their own VIP bungalow with private Jacuzzi, sofas and sun loungers.

The following month, and again leaving her husband at home, she took Kai and Klay to Cyprus for some quality time, tweeting: ‘Me and the kids love a holiday haha!!’

Her most recent holiday was a trip to Paris last weekend for a Jay-Z and Beyonce concert with friends.
