A grandfather has been found guilty today of racially abusing two Premier League footballers in front of his wife, children and grandson.

Everton fan William Blything hurled racist insults at Queen’s Park Rangers’ Korean captain Park Ji-Sung and Everton forward Victor Anichebe as his team drew 1-1 at Loftus Road on October 21.

Blything, from Wavertree, Liverpool, denied a count of racially-aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress but was found guilty at West London Magistrates’ Court.

However, he remained defiant after the verdict and said he is not racist and that his daughter has a 'coloured boyfriend.'

The 42-year-old was arrested after two fellow Evertonians reported him to stewards as he watched the game with his wife, 16-year-old daughter, 11-year-old son and three-year-old grandson.

Everton fan Neil Jordan told the court that he was 'outraged' by the abuse.

He posted a picture of Blything on Twitter, referring to him as a 'racist t***' before reporting him to stewards at the ground.

Mr Jordan said he first noticed Blything when he made one of his children cry by telling him to 'man up' when QPR scored a goal.

He later heard the Blything refer to Anichebe, who is originally from Nigeria, as a 'f****** black monkey'.

Mr Jordan said: 'At that point I realised that it wasn’t an isolated incident.

'There
was clearly some intent to target that player because, in my opinion, 
of the colour of his skin, coupled with general agitation and abuse 
aimed at the home end and abuse towards another opposition player.'

Louise Thomas, prosecuting, told the court that Mr Jordan was left 'shaking and distraught' by the abuse.

Also giving evidence, Everton fan John Murmame said he heard Blything shout 'Take down that chink' in reference to Park.

Mr Murmame said: 'I go to a lot of football games but this was exceptional.'

Passing verdict, District Judge Jeremy
Coleman said the defendant would not face a custodial penalty when he 
is sentenced on February 11.

He said: 'If the players had heard these comments - and there is no evidence that they did - it would have caused them upset.'

He added that he had taken into account that children had witnessed the abuse.

'This took place at a football match and we have a major problem as far as racist behaviour at football is concerned,' he said.

Defending himself, Blything admitted he had used 'foul language' but said it had not been racial in nature.

Originally from Southampton, he argued that both witnesses - who were at the game separately - had described the offender as having a Liverpool accent, whereas he does not.

Wearing a grey suit and blue shirt, Blything posed for pictures with an Everton scarf after the hearing.

Speaking outside court, he said: 'I have never used that kind of language in my life - never have done and never will.

'I was brought up in a black community and my 17-year-old daughter has a coloured boyfriend.

'There is something wrong with the justice system as far as I am concerned.'
