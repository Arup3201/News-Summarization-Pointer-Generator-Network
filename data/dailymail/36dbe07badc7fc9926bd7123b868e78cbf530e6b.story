He was brought in to restore Manchester United to the pinnacle of English football following the disastrous David Moyes era.

But Louis van Gaal has also already had a dramatic impact on the club's off-field fortunes - to the tune of £250m.

The club's share price on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has rocketed since it was announced back in May that Van Gaal would take charge.

When the Dutchman was announced as successor to Moyes on May 19, shares in United were trading at $16.74 (£9.86).

But after Holland reached the last four of the World Cup and United began their pre-season tour of the United States, this had risen to $19.35 (£11.40) by the close of business on Friday.

It means the 10 per cent stake in United floated on the NYSE back in 2012 has risen in value from £164,333,348 to £190,000,003 since van Gaal took over, pushing the club's overall value towards the £2bn mark.

The share price climbed steadily as van Gaal led Holland through the World Cup in Brazil, where they ultimately finished third.

This comes despite the new manager expressing concerns over player burn-out as United embarked on a lucrative four-stop tour of the United States.

They beat Roma 3-2 in Denver on Saturday night, following up from last week's 7-0 rout of the Los Angeles Galaxy.

Teenage kicks: United also signed Luke Shaw from Southampton this summer

The excitement over van Gaal's arrival at Old Trafford has led to the 55,000 allocation of season tickets being sold quicker than at any time since the ground reached its current capacity of 76,000.

United have also announced a 10-year kit deal with Adidas worth a mammoth £750m.

So far, United have signed two players this summer - Spain midfielder Ander Herrera from Athletic Bilbao for £29m and England left-back Luke Shaw from Southampton for £27m.

But vice-chairman Ed Woodward has said United would be willing to break the world transfer record of £86m should the right player become available.
