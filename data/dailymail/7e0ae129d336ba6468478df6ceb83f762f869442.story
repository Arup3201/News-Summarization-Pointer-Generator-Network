Andy King will serve a two-match Euro 2016 qualifying ban for his red card against Cyprus, the Football Association of Wales has announced.

The Leicester midfielder was shown a straight red card for fouling Cyprus captain Constantinos Makridis in Wales' 2-1 win at the Cardiff City Stadium on October 13.

UEFA has increased King's suspension for violent conduct and the 25-year-old will now miss Wales' away games in Belgium next month and in Israel in March.

Wales manager Chris Coleman has led his side to an unbeaten start in their Euro 2016 qualifying group

'The FAW has been informed by UEFA that Andy King has been suspended for two matches,' the Football Association of Wales said in an official tweet on Friday afternoon.

Wales manager Chris Coleman defended King after his dismissal early in the second half left Wales clinging on to their slim 2-1 advantage.

'It's not really his fault,' Coleman said at the time.

The Wales squad will be without King for the next two Group B qualifiers against Belgium and Israel

'The timing was wrong and he had a red but that's probably down to myself and the staff.

'We've been firing the lads up the last two games.

'We've been into the lads all week saying 'whatever they give to us, we give to them' and I can't blame Andy for that.'
