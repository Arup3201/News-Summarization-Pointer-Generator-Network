An eagle-eyed photographer has captured these incredible pictures of an orchid that looks just like a bird.

Photographer Christian Kneidinger, 50, was taking pictures in a botanical garden in Linz, Austria, when he realised he was looking at something special.

Initially the software engineer was trying to focus on the colour of the flowers but after an hour he took a closer look at the pink moth orchid and noticed an optical illusion of a bird in its centre.

Photographer Christian Kneidinger from Austria could not believe his eyes when he captured the images

‘I showed other visitors what I had captured, but no one could believe it. Everyone was so surprised, even when I showed them the orchid,’ he said.

‘I was trying to get some beautiful pictures of some beautiful plants. I never expected to see something so magical.’

‘I came by the bird completely by chance. I thought I was seeing things, but it felt so real.

‘I knew I had to capture it before it disappeared and I'd think my eyes had been deceiving me.’

Mr Kneidinger, who lives in Austria, used a DSLR 5D Mark III camera with a Canon EF 100mm f/2.8L lens and a Macro IS USM lens to capture the stunning pictures.

He said: ‘I looked through the finder of my DSLR and I noticed that it looked like a bird - I was really surprised.

Christian Kneidinger, 50 (pictured), said: 'I never expected to see something so magical¿

‘Looking at it through the camera monitor didn't have the same feeling as in real life, so I took my video LED light that I use to brighten shadows.

‘I placed the light behind the flower and reduced the intensity, and I got what I expected. It was amazing.’

The orchid, scientifically known as a Phalaenopsis, was found among the 10,000 various plants at the Botanical Garden in Linz, which houses five greenhouses full of exotic floras.

‘It shows how beautiful these flowers are and how nature is at one,’ added Mr Kneidinger.

‘I try to go with open eyes everywhere I go and I try to use different views.

‘I take time watching for my desired object and sometimes, like now, something unexpected happens.’
