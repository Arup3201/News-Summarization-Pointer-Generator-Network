A British soldier was killed in a firefight in Afghanistan today - the first UK death for nearly six months.

The serviceman, from 14 Signals Regiment (Electronic Warfare), died while taking part in a daring mission to disrupt insurgents and destroy weapons and bomb-making equipment.

He was on patrol with the elite Brigade Reconnaissance Force in Helmand Province when he was fatally wounded by gunfire.

A military spokesman said the soldier was 'the brightest and the best' who had heroically 'died defending his comrades'. Next of kin have been informed.

A total of 445 UK personnel have now died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001.

It is the first British death in the warzone since three soldiers - Corporal William Savage, Fusilier Samuel Flint, and Private Robert Hetherington - were killed when their Mastiff armoured vehicle hit an improvised explosive device (IED) on a routine patrol on April 30.

The latest soldier lost his life while supporting the Afghan National Security Forces on a mission near Kakaran, north east of provincial capital Lashkar Gah.

The number of UK troops taking part in patrols has significantly reduced since last year as responsibility for ground operations is handed to the Afghan army and police.

This means fewer Coalition forces are placed in danger before combat operations cease at the end of 2014.

But service personnel are still expected take part in missions to supervise the Afghan forces they have trained.

The soldier was struck by Taliban gunfire around 9am (5am GMT). Despite receiving immediate medical attention, he died from his injuries at the scene, said the Ministry of Defence.

The victim had been in Afghanistan 'a matter of weeks' after deploying with 7th Armoured Brigade, known as the Desert Rats, which took over command of the British mission in Helmand.

'A fantastic soldier has tragically died defending his comrades. He was the brightest and the best.'

- Lieutenant Colonel Hywel Lewis, Task Force Helmand

Lieutenant Colonel Hywel Lewis, spokesman for Task Force Helmand, said: 'A fantastic soldier has tragically died defending his comrades. He was the brightest and the best.

'Those who served alongside him were privileged and feel his loss most deeply. Our prayers and thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time.'

The role of 14th Signal Regiment (Electronic Warfare) includes locating the enemy's communications and disrupting them by jamming electronic systems and preventing them from working properly.

The troops of 7th Armoured Brigade are expected to do little fighting on the nine-month tour - three months longer than usual - as Afghan forces take the lead on all operations.

Part of its job will be the closure of bases around Helmand and the return of equipment to the UK.

Patrol Base 2 (PB2) was the last to close this year and only five bases remain into 2014, including Camp Bastion.

The British presence in Afghanistan will be almost halved by the end of this year to 5,200.
