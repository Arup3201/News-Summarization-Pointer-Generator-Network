Families will no longer have to switch tariffs to cut their power bills the government announced  today - but the changes will not come in for almost two years.

Under plans unveiled today, energy firms will be forced to move customers on to their best deals automatically, as David Cameron promised last month.

Each supplier is also expected to be restricted to only four tariffs for electricity and four for gas, but the reforms will only become compulsory in summer 2014.

The Prime Minister used Twitter to claim he had defied claims by the Labour party that his plan could not be delivered

The Prime Minister caught officials off guard when he made the pledge to force firms to give customers to lowest price.

But
 today he used Twitter to boast that he was true to his word: 'My 
promise to ensure energy customers get the lowest tariff is being 
delivered, despite Labour saying it couldn't be done.'

Energy Secretary Ed Davey set out details of the plans 
to simplify and slash the number of tariffs from the bewildering 500 on 
offer.

Critics warned the move could limit 
choice and see some of the cheapest deals for savvy customers who shop 
around disappear altogether.

Mr Davey said: 'I am determined
 to ensure all consumers get a better deal on their energy bill and get 
the cheapest tariff they can.

'Bill payers will no longer face the 
impossible choice between hundreds of tariffs; each customer will have a
 maximum of four tariffs for gas or electricity per supplier to 
consider.'

Households will 
be able to demand detailed information about their energy use which they
 can use to shop around, using price comparison websites or mobile phone
 apps.

Mr Davey added: 'For too long people have been stuck 
on the wrong type of energy tariff, paying more than they need to. Our 
new proposals will make things much clearer and easier to understand, so
 that bill payers can get the best deal and feel the benefit in their 
pockets.'

As many as seven in ten households pay over the odds for power – some by as much as £300 a year.

Officials
 said they want all customers on the cheapest price available from their
 supplier 'as quickly as possible and, at the latest, by summer 2014'.

Last night, a Downing Street 
spokesman said: ‘The Prime Minister said we would legislate to offer 
people the lowest tariff available and that is what’s going to happen. The cost of living is an issue close to his heart.’

The Prime Minister promised action to 
rein in the ‘Big Six’ energy suppliers – only to see prices soar by up 
to 11 per cent this autumn.

Bills have risen by £200 in two years 
to a record high of £1,300 and regulator Ofgem has called for simpler 
tariffs to try to halt the trend.  It is hoped that clearer charges will allow customers to compare deals offered by rival suppliers.

Ofgem’s chief executive Alistair 
Buchanan said: 'These proposals - based on Ofgem’s Retail Market Review 
(RMR) - will put an end to consumers being bamboozled by complex tariffs
 and deliver choice that consumers easily understand.

'We are also proposing much simpler information for consumers such as making suppliers give consumers their cheapest tariff on their bill. Ofgem is also going to enforce fair treatment of consumers using licence standards backed by fines.'

Research by comparison firm uSwitch 
has found households can save £135 by choosing a cheaper tariff from 
their supplier, or up to £300 by switching to a different provider.

Tom
 Lyon, energy expert at uSwitch, said: 'Simplifying tariffs and the 
market for consumers is a good thing. Giving consumers all the tools 
they need to select the best deal for their needs will give competition 
the kiss of life that it needs.

'However,
 we would be deeply concerned if the Government does go a leap further 
and insists that suppliers put all their customers on their cheapest 
deal – this would kill competition stone dead and could result in 
everyone paying higher prices in the long run.'

When
 Mr Cameron made the tariff pledge last month he was accused of paving 
the way for an ‘energy shambles’ that would destroy competition and 
drive up bills.

But consumer groups have welcomed the Government’s proposals.

Richard
 Lloyd, of Which?, said: ‘We want the Prime Minister to stick to what he
 promised and to force energy companies to give the lowest tariff to 
their customers.’

Ann 
Robinson, of uSwitch, said the proposals appeared to be a ‘good step 
forward’. She said simpler tariffs would help customers to shop around.

However, today there were warnings the move will mean fewer low-price deals.

Guy Newey, head of energy and environment at centre-right thinktank Policy Exchange, said: 'Cutting the number of tariffs and forcing energy companies to put households on the ‘best’ rate could end cheap deals. This risks punishing families who do the right thing and shop around.'

Angela Knight, chief executive of EnergyUK which represents energy firms, added: 'If that’s what the Government wants then that is fine. What it will do is it will remove some choice away from people, and certainly some deals that people get at the moment.'

Ms Knight added that much of the costs which make up household bills are linked to global fuel prices which are 'outside the control of anybody'.

'There’s a very significant proportion of your bill which relates to such things as what people have to pay for upgrading the works, the pipes, the network, and what people are paying as well for such things, we refer to them as obligations, the requirements placed on the major companies to insulate homes,' she told BBC Radio 4.

'That can add up to about half your bill. So what we’re talking about is only part of the bill, and that part of the bill that we’re talking about the majority of it is affected by whatever the world price is of energy and particularly of gas.'

Corin Taylor, Senior Economic Adviser at the Institute of Directors (IoD), warned: 'These reforms miss the point when it comes to reducing energy bills. Clumsy regulation restricting choice would simply allow energy companies to increase their lowest tariff, ensuring a higher minimum price for consumers.'

Greenpeace Energy Campaigner Louise Hutchins said: 'The Government can tinker with the tariff system all it likes, but until Britain reduces its reliance on volatile world gas markets, even the cheapest tariff will keep rising.'

Public outcry: Bills have risen by £200 in two years to a record high of £1,300

Caroline Flint, Labour’s energy spokesman, warned that suppliers might now offer fewer but more expensive tariffs.

'David Cameron is trying to pull the wool over people’s eyes. The Prime Minister promised to force the energy companies to put everyone on the cheapest tariff and he has broken his promise.

'All the Government is really doing is 
reducing the number of tariffs on offer. If energy companies are only 
allowed to offer one tariff for every type of contract, that’s not the 
lowest tariff – it’s the only tariff.'

Since last month SSE, British Gas, Npower and Scottish Power have hiked their prices.

EDF will raise prices by a massive 10.8 per cent from December and E.On is expected to follow suit in January.

Consumer Focus said last month it would welcome any attempt to ‘make the energy market clearer and simpler’ to help vulnerable groups such as the elderly who are least likely to switch.

However the statutory group urged the Prime Minister to address customers’ concerns about the relationship between wholesale costs and retail prices.

E.ON, SSE, Npower and British Gas have all already taken measures to cut the number of core tariffs they offer, following recommendations from Ofgem and the Prime Minister last month. E.ON is on four, SSE three, British Gas six and Npower eight.

Last week a whistle-blower exposed the apparent rigging of Britain’s £300billion wholesale gas market by City traders.

The Government's plans to improve the lot of energy consumers remain a far way off. In the meantime, you continue to do an annual check on your deal to ensure it is the cheapest.

If you haven't switched supplier for a few years, you could save hundreds of pounds a year by moving to the lowest tariff. The saving could be as much as £300 annually.

Most of the major suppliers are currently hiking prices ahead of winter - SSE, which trades as Southern Electric, SWALEC and Atlantic Energy -  was last month the first to up its prices in the latest round and the largest operator, British Gas, followed suit last Friday.

The best starting point is to read the round-up on This is Money, MailOnline's sister website, which highlights the best tariffs, or just do a quick search on your postcode - deals vary in different regions - using the tool on the right.
