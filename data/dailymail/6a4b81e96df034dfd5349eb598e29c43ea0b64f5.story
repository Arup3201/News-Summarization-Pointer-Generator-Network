Cuba has announced that it will ease restrictions on car imports for the first time in half a century, marking the end of an era that made icons of the island's vintage automobiles.

The official newspaper Granma said the decision to allow cars to be imported for sale at market prices on the island was taken Wednesday by Cuba's council of ministers.

It said the decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles- automobiles, vans, trucks and motorcycles- and end the practice of granting some Cubans special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege.

More cars on the road: Cuban streets have seen very few new cars over the past 50 years because of the embargo against foreign importers

New era: The decision will gradually free up retail sales of all manner of vehicles and end the practice of granting some Cubans special permission to bring in vehicles as a privilege

Hanging out: A group of Cubans remain atop a classic US car in Havana, watching one of the first automobile competitions with the support of Cuban sports organizations

New leaf: The government of Cuba agreed to make more flexible the retail sales of new and used vehicles in the island allowing Cubans to buy cars from government retailers without permissions

Granma acknowledged the so-called 
‘letters of authorization’ issued by the transport ministry had 
generated ‘resentment, dissatisfaction and, in not a few cases ... 
(were) a source of speculation and enrichment.’

Holders of the letters, however, will still be first in line to buy cars while the new system is phased in, Granma said.

Opening
 Cuba's domestic car market to imports is likely to have fateful 
consequences for the lovingly maintained 1950s Chevys, Fords and 
Pontiacs that have survived a 50-year-old US embargo.

No
 official figures are available on Cuba's automobile fleet, but experts 
believe there are around 60,000 American cars still circulating on the 
island.

Mixed in with them 
are Soviet-made Ladas and Moskvich cars made in the 1970s and '80s and 
more modern, usually Asian-made, vehicles imported by the government.

Mint
 condition Cadillacs, Chryslers and Oldsmobile convertibles can still be
 seen carrying tourists around Havana, but most of the rolling relics 
from pre-revolutionary Cuba are now used for collective public 
transportation.

Cuba was the leading importer of North American manufactured cars by the early 1950s.

By 1955, the island nation was home to 125,000 Detroit-made cars.

Cubans were enamored with the so-called Chariots of Chrome, so much so that the '57 Chevy's debut in Havana--which, astonishingly, came before the car's U.S. premier--attracted a crowd of 40,000.

But in 1959, Castro and his revolutionaries seized power in Cuba and immediately set about changing the nation's relationship with America.

Castro's regime sought greater communalism and nationalism. His country's love affair with the American car, a symbol of both capitalist success and excess, had to go.

‘The Cadillac does not provide jobs for anyone,’ Castro said shortly after seizing power. ‘The Cadillac does not increase the wealth of the country. It diminishes it.’

The dictator halted all imports of American-made cars.

Only those who owned cars in or before 1959 were granted ful private ownership of the automobile. For everyone else, that right was revoked from then on.

From that day on, for the next half century, Cubans would be forced out of both a necessity and a deep sense of nostalgia to meticulously maintain their vehicles.

Over 50 years later, in November 2011, the restrictions on the sale of one's personal car would finally be lifted in Cuba.

The antique Cadillacs, Chevrolets, and Buicks could suddenly change hands.

And on December 13, 2013, Cuban officials voted to allow the sale of imported cars on the island for the first time since the revolution.

One more step: This is the latest sign of liberalization on the part of the Communist regime led by Raul Castro (seen shaking President Obama's had during Nelson Mandela's memorial service)

The changes are a long-awaited element of President Raul Castro's attempts to gradually liberalize Cuba's Soviet-style economy.

The government in September 2011 allowed Cubans and foreigners living on the island to sell their used cars to one another.

‘We've been waiting for this for 20 years,’ said a 54-year-old professional in Old Havana, who would not give his name.

Freddy Mugercia, a 41-year-old taxi driver, also welcomed the news.

‘Now anyone who has money will be able to buy a car. There were a lot of people who had received money from their families (outside Cuba) and weren't able to,’ he said.

Granma provided few specifics on how the broader car market will work, saying the new rules would be made public in the coming days.

Market flood to come: Because of the restricted supply, car prices in Cuba are already astronomical and the cars that were imported from before the embargo are kept in mint condition

Rainy days: A man rides his tricycle taxi beside a car held up on concrete blocks, one of many vintage American automobiles that lasted well past their glory days ni the Caribbean nation

A man cycles beside a U.S.-made car used as a private collective taxi, parked beside a mural of the Cuban national flag, in Havana. Collective taxis, also known as almendron, have established routes around or near Havana, picking up and dropping off passengers along the way

Cheap ride: The price of a journey in these taxis ranges from $0.50 for a ride within the city to $1 for a 30km lift

But it said pricing of new vehicles should be similar to that for used vehicles sold privately.

That suggests the government will impose hefty taxes on sales of imported vehicles.

Because of the restricted supply, car prices in Cuba are already astronomical.

A basic Lada in good condition, for example, sells for around $12,000, about as much as a '57 Ford that has gotten decades of use as a taxi.

A Cadillac convertible, like those that cruise the Havana waterfront with tourists aboard, can cost up to $80,000.

For most Cubans, with salaries that average just $20 a month, owning a car is still just a dream.

In the meantime, Granma said, proceeds from car sales are to go to finance upgrades to Cuba's public transportation system.
