The Hollywood epic about Noah's ark has managed to unite Christians and Muslims.

Members of the two religions - at odds for more than a thousand years - are singing with one voice to condemn the £75million film Noah for its take on the Biblical hero.

The blockbuster has already been banned in three Arab countries after religious leaders complained that it depicted the Biblical figure - who is also a prophet in the Koran.

Fatwa: Noah, a blockbuster starring Russell Crowe, pictured, has been banned in three Arab countries and three more could soon follow after a fatwa was issued against it by leading figures in Sunni Islam

God's messenger: Noah, said to have built an ark (pictured) which saved the human and animal worlds from a great flood, features in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, but depicting Allah's messengers is banned

Due to première later this month, the film will not show in Qatar, Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates 
and several other countries are expected to follow suit.

But
 it appears that America's devout Christians are also annoyed about the 
portrayal of the antediluvian patriarch, claiming after test screenings 
that director Darren Aronofsky had made him 'too dark'.

In
 exchange for his eight-figure budget, the auteur filmmaker was forced 
to allow backer Paramount to conduct as many as half a dozen test 
screenings to test the waters while work was still in progress.

A
 representative of an Australian pentecostal megachurch present for one 
warned The Hollywood Reporter: 'If you're expecting it to be word for 
word from the Bible, you're in for a shock.

'There can be an opportunity for Christians to take offence.'

Another
 viewer at a separate test screening was more blunt, saying it depictued
 Noah as a 'crazy, irrational, religious nut' who is obsessed with 
apparently modern day problems like overpopulation.

Fatwa: Cairo's al-Azhar (which includes the mosque pictured left) issued a fatwa, which is a ruling under Islamic law, saying the film starring Russell Crowe (right) as Noah was a 'clear violation' of their teachings

Epic: The film is due to premiere in the U.S. on March 28 and was due to air in Egypt in the near future

The
 criticisms come as of the world's most respected Islamic institutions 
issued a fatwa against the Hollywood epic because it 'contradicts the 
teachings of Islam'.

Islam 
forbids representing holy figures in art, instead using conceptual line 
patterns and lettering to adorn the walls of mosques.

Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852) by Harriet Beecher Stowe

Russian Orthodox: As well as being banned in the southern U.S. for objecting to slavery, it was outlawed by Nicolas I in Russia who felt it 'undermined religious ideals'.

Borstal Boy (1958) by Brendan Behan

Irish Catholic: A gritty account of a boy's awakening in a youth prison, the book was believed to have been banned due to several aspects including its depictions of adolescent sexuality and the Catholic Church.

Carrie (1974) by Stephen King

Christian (various): The horror story of a shy schoolgirl with horrific telekinetic powers is one of the most banned books in U.S. schools for its violence and treatment of religion.

The Satanic Verses (1988) by Salman Rushdi

Muslim:
 The book, which challenged a key story of the Prophet Mohammed, led to a
 fatwa being issued against the author and an assassination attempt by 
extremists.

The Hindus: An Alternative History (2009) by academic Wendy Deniger

Hindu: Penguin India withdrew copies of the previously little-known work after religious campaigners made several complaints, including that a deity on the front cover was having her breasts touched by another figure.

A
 whole chapter of the Koran is devoted to Noah, who legend tells built 
an ark which saved himself, his family and many pairs of animals from a 
great flood.

He also features prominently in the Biblical book of Genesis and is revered by Christians and Jews.

The
 fatwa - a ruling or injunction under the laws of Islam - was made by 
the influential Al-Azhar institution in Egypt's capital Cairo, a centre 
of Sunni Islam thought which was founded in around AD970 and includes a 
university and a mosque.

'Al-Azhar...
 renews its objection to any act depicting the messengers and prophets 
of God and the companions of the Prophet (Mohammad), peace be upon him,'
 it announced in a statement.

The
 fatwa added that the depictions 'provoke the feelings of believers... 
and are forbidden in Islam and a clear violation of Islamic law'.

The film also stars Anthony Hopkins and Emma Watson and will premiere in the U.S. on March 28.

Depictions
 of the Prophet Mohammad in European and North American media have 
repeatedly sparked deadly protests in Islamic countries over the last 
decade, fanning cultural tensions with the West.

The
 worst riots were triggered after the Prophet Mohammad was depicted in a
 Danish newspaper in 2006. It sparked protests in the Middle East, 
Africa and Asia in which at least 50 people died.

A
 spokesman for Paramount Pictures said: 'Censors for Qatar, Bahrain and 
the UAE (United Arab Emirates) officially confirmed this week that the 
film will not release in their countries.

'The
 official statement they offered in confirming this news is because "it 
contradicts the teachings of Islam",' the representative said, adding 
the studio expected a similar ban in Egypt, Jordan and Kuwait.

Perhaps
 wisely the filming took place nowhere near the Middle East, instead 
being carried out in New York State and in Southern Iceland.

Harry
 Potter star Emma Watson plays the adopted daughter of the prophet, 
while screen legend Anthony Hopkins stars as his sagely grandfather.

Jennifer
 Connelly will play Naameh, Noah's wife.  She won an Oscar for best 
supporting actress for her appearance alongside Crowe in A Beautiful 
Mind (2001).

The title role was reportedly offered to Michael Fassbender and Christian Bale - both of whom declined.

Jerry
 A. Johnson, president of a conservative National Religious Broadcasters
 (NRB) group, said last month he wanted to 'make sure everyone who sees 
this impactful film knows this is an imaginative interpretation of 
Scripture, and not literal.'

Paramount responded by agreeing to issue a disclaimer on advertising for the film.

'While
 artistic license has been taken, we believe that this film is true to 
the essence, values and integrity of a story that is a cornerstone of 
faith for millions of people worldwide,' it reads.

1) Life of Brian - The Monty Python film enraged Christians with its irreverent take on the Jesus story satirised through an account of a fictional contemporary called Brian.

2) Dogma - Mallrats director Kevin Smith received death threats after he turned his sharp humour on the Catholic church with this film, which was met by organised protests in some countries.

3) Innocence of Muslims - This inflammatory YouTube video, which sparked outrage in the Islamic world, was packed with incendiary anti-Muslim content. It was removed from YouTube this month after an actor duped by the film's producer took Google to court.

Stars: Russell Crowe as Noah with Jennifer Connelly, who plays his wife Naameh and won an Oscar for best supporting actress for her appearance alongside Crowe in A Beautiful Mind

The film is not the first to stoke controversy among Muslims.

Mel
 Gibson's 2004 film The Passion of the Christ, showing Jesus's 
crucifixion, was widely screened in the Arab World despite objections by
 Muslim clerics.

A 2012, an 
amateur Youtube video deriding the Prophet Mohammad which was produced 
in California stoked protests throughout the region, and may have 
contributed to a deadly militant raid in Libya which killed the U.S. 
ambassador and three other American staff.
