The exams regulator has approved a new English A-Level to be taught in schools which will see sixth formers study comedian Russell Brand and rapper Dizzee Rascal.

Ofqual has given the go-ahead for the new qualification to be taught from next September, according to the OCR exam board, which drew up the course with the English and Media Centre.

Among the works that will be required to be studied on the course include Mr Brand's evidence on drugs policy which was presented to MPs and the transcript of a BBC Newsnight interview with Dizzee Rascal.

As part of a new English A-Level to be offered by the OCR exam board from next September, students will study texts such as the transcript of Russell Brand giving evidence to MPs on drugs policy 

The OCR board say including a rich mix of content, such as speeches by Russell Brand, pictured, would inspire and engage students

Students will also have to study extracts by The Secret Footballer, who has anonymously written about professional football as well as tweets by the broadcaster and columnist Caitlin Moran and memoirs such as Twelve Years A Slave.

They will be on the text list alongside more traditional literature such as poems by Emily Dickinson and William Blake and works by George Orwell, William Shakespeare and Charlotte Bronte.

The organisations who drew up the syllabus say the aim of the new A-level is for students to 'develop the skills to analyse any text, whether spoken or written, literary or non-literary, in the most appropriate way.

They add that students studying a play like The Importance of Being Earnest by Oscar Wilde will have to look at ideas such as form, structure and dramatic techniques, while those reading the transcript of the Dizzee Rascal interview will look at concepts like purpose and audience.

When the draft content of the course was published earlier this year there were reports that the Department for Education (DfE) was critical of the qualification, suggesting it representing a 'dumbing down' of the subject.

But Paul Dodd, director of reform at OCR said: 'We are delighted that Ofqual has accredited this fresh and exciting new specification.

'Both OCR and EMC believe that combined English Language and Literature offers something special. 

'Our aim in creating the specification was to produce a course with a rich, diverse mix of content - including highly regarded contemporary texts as well as long-established works - that will inspire and engage a new generation of students.'

While an Ofqual spokeswoman said: 'We have accredited OCR’s English Language and Literature AS and A level.

'The content requirements for this qualification are set by Government and we set the requirements for how it should be assessed. We have a robust process in place to make sure the qualifications we accredit meet these requirements.

The English course is one of a number of new A-levels due to be brought in next year following the Government’s major overhaul of the exams system.

A DfE spokesman said: 'The criteria for English language and literature clearly set out the expectations exam boards must meet, in order to be approved.

'Decisions on whether these criteria have been met are rightly a matter for Ofqual.'
