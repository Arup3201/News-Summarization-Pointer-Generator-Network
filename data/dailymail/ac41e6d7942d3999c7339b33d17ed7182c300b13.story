The U.S. federal government has prompted controversy after spending over $33,000 on a study to find out whether same-sex couples live closer to tobacco shops than heterosexuals.

The large sum was spent on a study by the National Institutes of Health entitled, 'Relationship Between Tobacco Retailer Density and Sexual Minority Couples.'

But it's likely to raise questions about how the government is spending money, particularly at a time when there are widespread economic problems.

Smoking habits: The $33,341 report found that gay couples are more likely to smoke than heterosexuals

Joseph Lee, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, lead the research.

He interviewed gays, bisexuals, and lesbians at bars in West Virginia to see if they smoked, and  picked up cigarette butts outside of community colleges for his prior tobacco research.

The report found that gay couples are more likely to smoke than heterosexuals.

Spending bill: On Tuesday President Obama signed a $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress

This was due to where they lived in the U.S. which tended to be in urban neighborhoods where there were more tobacco retailers.

The report also found that 'Living near a tobacco retailer has been associated with decreased success in quitting tobacco. Tobacco use is substantially higher among sexual minorities than among heterosexuals.

'The reasons for this persistent disparity remain unclear, but the high toll of death and disability from tobacco use creates substantial health inequalities in cancer.' 

The $33,341 study was carried out using information from nearly 100,000 tobacco retailers in 97 U.S. counties with census data to find out whether same-sex couples lived nearby. 

The National Institutes of Health is a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human services.

It describes itself as 'the nation’s leading medical research agency—making important discoveries that improve health and save lives.'

Last week, President Obama signed a $1.1 trillion spending bill passed by Congress last week that lifted the threat of a government shutdown.

The legislation funds most government agencies through September 2015.
