Phebe Hilliage avoided having her foot amputated because she was wearing Doc Martens after a car ran over her foot at a zebra crossing in Birmingham

A 12-year-old girl who was knocked over on a zebra crossing by a hit and run driver has avoided having her foot amputated because she was wearing Doc Martens - rather than her school shoes which had a hole in - when she was hit.

Phebe Hilliage was left with a broken right ankle and shattered foot after a car ploughed into her in Birmingham, West Midlands as she walked to school. 

But the girl escaped having to have her foot amputated because she was wearing her  sturdy Doc Martens when the driver drove right over her foot.

The driver of the red car, who sped off leaving the child lying in the road, has still not been identified.

Lucy Hilliage, Phebe's mother, said: 'We're so lucky that Phebe wasn't in her normal school shoes as the car went right over her foot.

'The doctors said the injuries would have been so bad they would have had to amputate the foot.

'It's completely changed her outlook on life, she's not the free spirit she was before the accident.

'What makes it worse is the driver didn't even stop.

'They just left her lying in the middle of the road - it's sickening.

'They could have kids themselves and imagine if that had happened to them.

'They need to come forward and give Phebe some respite.'

The 12-year-old has been told she will be in a cast for months and will not be able to go to go to Swanhurst School for more than a month because of her injuries. 

She has already had surgery on her foot but her mother said they will not know until the New Year whether it has been successful. 

'The doctors can't be sure whether the initial surgery has been a success,' added Ms Hillage. 

'She'll definitely need extensive physiotherapy and rehabilitation and the injuries have changed her life no matter what.

'The damage to the nerves could have affected her balance for life.'

West Midlands Police decided to release footage of the hit and run in the hope that someone might recognise the car so they could trace the driver of the car. 

The footage was captured by an on-board camera on a bus, which had been overtaken by the red car shortly before the girl was hit at about 7.30am on November 21 in Vicarage Road in Kings Heath, Birmingham.

A red car is clearly shown overtaking at speed, but the vehicle and driver have never been traced.

Phebe said: 'I was halfway across when this car overtook the bus and two cars which had stopped and ran over my foot.

'I dropped to the floor and felt like I was in a dream - I was confused and didn't know what was happening.

'The driver has ruined Christmas for me.

'I'd planned to go out and see friends but now I'm stuck in the house because of this accident.

The 12-year-old has been left with her leg in plaster and unable to go to school for the next month

'If I could say anything to them I'd say 'you're an idiot, a stupid person who needs to learn to drive safely'.'

She was taken to Birmingham Children's Hospital where doctors had to remove shattered bones from her foot and put her right ankle in a cast. 

PC Laura Loy, from the West Midlands Police Road Traffic Investigation Unit, said: 'Despite the collision being captured by the camera, we have been unable to identify what the unknown car is.

'The collision took place at a busy time in the morning and there were lots of people around who may have seen what happened or be able to tell us what the car is.'
