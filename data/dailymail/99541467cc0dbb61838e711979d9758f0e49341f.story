Cover-ups: Disgraced pastor A.B. Schirmer, of Pennsylvania, will spend life in prison for the murder of one wife, while awaiting trial for the death of another

A former Pennsylvania pastor has been sentenced to life in prison 
without parole in the fatal bludgeoning of his second wife in 2008.

Arthur 'A.B.' Schirmer was sentenced in Monroe County Court on Monday, nearly 
two months after a jury convicted him of first-degree murder in the 
death of Betty Schirmer.

The conviction brought an automatic life 
sentence.

Prosecutors say he clubbed his wife on the
head with a crowbar, then loaded her into their car and staged a 
low-speed accident in an effort to conceal the crime.

Schirmer is also charged with killing his first wife, Jewel Schirmer, in 1999.

He awaits trial in that case.

In September, a grand jury concluded that he killed both women with blunt objects.

Jewel Schirmer, 50, died at Hershey Medical Center of a traumatic brain injury from an alleged fall down a flight of stairs.

Schirmer said he came home on April 23, 
1999, to find Jewel lying at the bottom of some steps and bleeding from 
the head. She died the next day.

Police
and prosecutors reopened the probe after her husband came under 
investigation in the 2008 death of his second wife, Betty, in the Pocono
Mountains.

Schirmer was 
charged two years ago with killing Betty and staging a car accident to 
cover it up.

In the death of his second wife, he said he was driving Betty to Pocono 
Medical Center on July 15, 2008, when she awoke complaining of jaw pain 
and she had removed her seat belt to get comfortable.

He claimed a deer ran into the road and he swerved to avoid it, crashing
into the guide rail and causing Betty to hit her head against the 
windshield

Police later said the damage to the 
car was too minor to have caused an injury that produced as much blood 
as paramedics found in the car.

Last year a Lebanon County grand jury cited medical testimony that revealed Schirmer used blunt objects to kill both his wives.

In cuffs: Schirmer has long denied having anything to do with either of his wives' deaths in 1999 and 2008

Hypocrite: Schirmer cheated on his first wife Jewel throughout their marriage, police claimed, with women in his congregation at Reeders United Methodist Church in Jackson Township, Pennsylvania

'We
find it particularly disturbing and difficult to believe that both of 
A.B. Schirmer's wives could have suffered such horrific injuries by 
accident.

'To the contrary,
we believe probable cause exists to believe that neither woman died 
from an accident,' said the grand jury's report.

Arnold declined to speculate on a 
motive, but the grand jury report indicates that Schirmer was unfaithful
to Jewel throughout their marriage, carrying on affairs with women in 
the church.

The grand jury also said the Schirmers had financial difficulties.

Vindicated: This fall, DA Dave Arnold, right, announced that Schirmer had been charged in the 1999 death of his first wife. Jewel Schirmer's brother, John Behney, pictured alongside, said he had waited 13 years for that day
