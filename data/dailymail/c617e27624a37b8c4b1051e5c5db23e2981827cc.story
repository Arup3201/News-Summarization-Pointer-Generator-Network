A week of wild weather in Victoria turned lethal when three men died in a road accident at the scene of a fallen tree.

Police say two of the men were trying to clear a pine tree from a road at Broadwater near Warrnambool, southwest of Victoria, on Friday night when a Ford sedan crashed and instantly killed them. A passenger in the car suffered critical injuries and later died in hospital.

The Bureau of Meteorology has since issued a severe weather warning covering much of Victoria on Saturday. Wind gusts up to 100km/h are expected before a gusty southwesterly change on Saturday night that could hit some coastal areas with a storm surge.

Warrnambool's Sergeant Callum McKinnon said there were initially three men at the scene - one was using a chainsaw to cut the tree while the others cleared the branches.

The two men - including the one holding the chainsaw - died at the scene on Woolsthorpe-Haywood road after 9pm.

Four children in the back seat of the second car escaped injury while the driver was taken to hospital with minor wounds.

BoM senior forecaster Stephen King said gusts up to 100km/h were recorded early on Saturday at Mount Hotham, Mt Buller and Kilmore Gap, north of Melbourne. Up to 40cm of snow is expected at the state's ski resorts during the day.

A Victoria SES spokesman said they've been 'pretty quiet' since wild conditions on Tuesday. Only 50 distress calls were made to 9am on Saturday across the state

'Most of the state had wind gusts of 80-90km/h overnight, which is not as high as the winds we saw on Tuesday but was enough to have caused a few fallen trees around the place,' Mr King said.

The State Emergency Service had a quiet night despite the strong winds. Only 50 distress calls were made to 9am on Saturday across the state.

A severe weather warning for damaging winds has been issued for all districts except the Mallee, with damaging winds to 60km/h and gusts to 100km/h for Saturday.

Mr King said a strong cold front associated with an intense low pressure system would begin to move across Victoria from the west from Saturday afternoon, with sustained strong southwesterly winds behind it.

This might herald the return of a storm surge when combined with a high tide expected on the southwest coast about midnight.

Storm surges were seen in the southwest and Melbourne during Tuesday's storm, when a southwesterly swell combined with high tides to cause minor flooding in areas including Warrnambool, Southbank, Elwood and Frankston.

The surge caused damage to piers and boardwalks along the coast.
