Hundreds of police union members turned up outside court today  to support 16 New York policemen charged with abusing their authority by helping family and friends avoid paying traffic tickets.

The 13 officers, two sergeants, one lieutenant and five others were arraigned in a Bronx court on Friday after handing themselves in last night following a mammoth city investigation.

But union members made their voice heard by clogging the street near the courthouse, filling the hallways near the arraignment room and applauding in court after the officers left.

Charged: Top row (left to right) Joseph Anthony, Virgilio Bencosme, Jason Cenizal, Jennara Cobb; bottom row (left to right) Eugene P. O'Reilly, Jaime Payan, Ruben Peralta, Jose R. Ramos

Charged: Top row (left to right) Michael Hernandez, Marc Manara, Christopher Manzi, Brian McGuckin; bottom row (left to right) Jeffrey L. Regan, Luis R. Rodriguez, Christopher Scott, Jacob G. Solorzano

Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said ticket fixing was sanctioned at the highest levels of the department, and he vowed that when the dust settled, they would prove it.

'Taking care of your family, taking care of your friends is not a crime,' he said. 'To take a courtesy and turn it into a crime is wrong.'

The case began with a 2009 internal 
probe into Bronx officer Jose Ramos, who was suspected of associating 
with a drug dealer, officials said.

While
listening to the NYPD officer's phone, investigators allegedly heard 
calls from people seeing if he could fix tickets for them.

Ramos has been working for the department for nearly 18 years. He and his wife were arrested at their home on Thursday night.

All other 15 policemen turned themselves in, reported the New York Post.

The policemen in court on Friday pleaded not guilty to charges including misconduct, grand larceny and obstructing administration.

‘If he had done any of these things that they say, they would've arrested him two months ago,’ his lawyer John Sandleitner said. ‘Or two years ago’

‘Why did they let him go to work, then? Bring the charges on. None of this slipping it out and releasing to the press.’

The conversation overheard on the Ramos wiretap led to more wiretaps that produced evidence of other officers having similar conversations.

Some of those arrested are officials 
within the department's largest and most powerful union, the Patrolmen's
Benevolent Association. The union's members were out in force at the court on Friday.

An unrelated Bronx drink-driving case 
forced prosecutors to reveal that the arresting officer was among those 
recorded talking about ticket fixing.

A union delegate allegedly told an officer ‘I'll get this taken care of’ by having a ticket issued to a girlfriend of the officer's cousin pulled the next day, a phone transcript said.

The case doesn't appear to rise to the level of the more notorious corruption scandals in the nation's largest police department.

But in terms of the number of officers facing charges, it represents the largest crackdown on police accused of misconduct in recent memory.

Five current and three former officers were hit with charges including conspiracy  earlier this week for allegedly being part of a gun-running ring.

In another recent unrelated case, an officer was charged with arresting a black man without cause and using a racial slur to describe him.

One other case involved an officer using a law enforcement database to try to trump up charges against an innocent man.

'This issue could have and should have been addressed differently'

As the ticket-fixing investigation unfolded, union officials complained that the probe unfairly singled out officers for an unofficial practice.

This is the practice of undoing paperwork on traffic citations before they reach court, which has been tolerated for years.

‘This issue could have and should have been addressed differently,’ Mr Lynch said.

Aside from those officers charged criminally, dozens more could face internal charges from the NYPD, which has about 35,000 officers.

Problems: Commissioner Raymond Kelly has addressed the issue by installing a new system to track tickets and make it harder to tamper with the paper trail

The last serious NYPD corruption scandal was the ‘Dirty 30’ case involving more than 33 officers from Harlem's 30th Precinct in the early 1990s.

Most pleaded guilty to charges including stealing cash from drug dealers, taking bribes, beating suspects and lying under oath to cover their tracks.

In one disciplinary case from earlier 
this year, a former union financial secretary in the Bronx admitted 
administrative misconduct charges.

That secretary was docked 40 days of vacation and suspended for five days.

NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly has addressed the issue.

The force installed a new computer system last autumn that tracks tickets and makes it harder to tamper with the paper trail.

Commissioner Kelly also recently formed a new unit within internal affairs to look into ticket fixing.

Its officers sit in on traffic court testimony and comb through paperwork to ensure none of the methods are being wrongly employed.
