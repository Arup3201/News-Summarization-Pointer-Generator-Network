A 52-year-old man who allegedly fired a Civil War cannon at his neighbor's house for eight days straight during an ongoing feud was arrested yesterday.

New York's Brian J. Malta is accused of repeatedly firing the antique long tom, loaded with a powder charge and wadding, at the Prosser Hill Road, Jamestown property.

While it is not illegal to own a cannon, deputies reportedly confiscated it because it was used maliciously.

Malta lives in the rural town of Kiantone, on the Pennsylvania border about 60 miles south of Buffalo.

While AP reported Malta fired at the homes of multiple neighbors, Buffalo YNN claimed Malta's wrath was just directed toward one for more than a week.

Malta was arrested about 11am yesterday, but released from the Chautauqua County Jail after posting $2,500 bail.

He is due to face North Harmony Town Court charged with three counts of second-degree menacing and three counts of second-degree harassment.

Details of the dispute have not been released.
