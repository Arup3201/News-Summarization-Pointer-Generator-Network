A father and son were facing child porn charges after sordid material was found at their home during a separate sexual assault investigation involving a 14-year-old girl.

Police had executed a search warrant at the Midland Park, New Jersey home of Richard Stoldt, 58, while investigating his 19-year-old son James on Tuesday. 

According to prosecutors, the 14-year-old girl recently told a friend that James assaulted her when she was 13. 

Richard Stoldt (right), 58, and his son James (left), 19, were arrested for possessing child pornography that was discovered during a sexual assault investigation allegedly involving James and a 14-year-old girl 

The girl was interviewed by police after the friend contacted authorities and James Stoldt was subsequently arrested, according to NBC 4. 

Computers that were seized from the father and son's home revealed that they were each independently accessing child pornography, according to Bergen County Prosecutor John L. Molinelli.

'Computer media used by each, separate and distinct from one another, were found to contain images depicting the sexual exploitation of children,' Molinelli said in a statement, according to NJ.com. 

Richard Stoldt, a software engineer, was arrested on a charge of child endangerment and was released on his own recognizance, meaning he did not need to pay bail after agreeing in writing to appear for all of his court proceedings.

His son was arrested on sexual assault and child endangerment charges and is in custody at Bergen County Jail, where his bail was set at $125,000.  

According to prosecutors, computers seized from the home revealed that father (right) and son were each independently accessing child pornography. James Stoldt (left) has also been charged with sexual assault
