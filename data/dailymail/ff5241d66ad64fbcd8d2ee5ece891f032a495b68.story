The confidante of Moors murderer Ian Brady appeared in public for the first time since her arrest over a mystery letter handed to her by the child killer - thought to contain the location of his only undiscovered victim.

Jackie Powell, Brady's mental health advocate for 13 years, stepped out to support her lover in court over a heroin possession charge yesterday.

Miss Powell, 49, sat next to Clive Pinder, 44, at Llanelli Magistrates' Court, South Wales, where he admitted the offence and was handed a £55 fine and costs of £40.

Pinder, who has over 80 convictions including kidnap and violent attacks, was arrested after police discovered heroin, a hypodermic needle, wraps and burnt foil at Miss Powell's home where the couple were staying.

Miss Powell  was arrested last month on suspicion 
of preventing the lawful burial of a body after becoming embroiled in controversy following her participation in
a Channel 4 documentary, Endgames Of A Psychopath.

On camera, Miss 
Powell said Brady had given her a sealed envelope to be opened after his
death, which would ‘allow [Keith’s mother] Winnie Johnson to find 
peace’.

She speculated that the contents 
might reveal the location of 12-year-old Keith’s body on Saddleworth 
Moor, which overlooks Oldham.

When police raided her home they failed to uncover the letter but instead came across the drugs - which 
Pinder claimed ownership of.

Until yesterday she had not been seen out in public since.

A police spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said today that the investigation into Miss Powell, who is on bail, is still ongoing.

Keith Bennett was the only one of the child killer's five victims whose body has never been recovered.

He was snatched off the street by Brady and Hindleyas he walked to his grandmother's house in Longsight, Manchester, on June 16, 1964.

His mother Winnie Johnson dedicated her life to finding her son's body, making several 
thousand trips to the Moors in search of her son, but died of cancer just days after Powell's arrest unable to fulfill her wish.

Mrs Johnson wrote ‘hundreds’ of letters to Brady
begging him to reveal where Keith’s body is buried before she died.

It included a heartfelt plea in December revealing the extent of her 
illness - but he has refused to reveal the location.
