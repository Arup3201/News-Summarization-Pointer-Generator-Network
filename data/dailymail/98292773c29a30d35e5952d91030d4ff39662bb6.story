A giraffe made a bid for freedom when it escaped from a circus and went on the run down a busy road in Mexico.

Drivers were forced to pull over to avoid the animal, called Bingo, after it slipped out of its enclosure at Barley Circus in the town of San Nicolas de los Garza near Monterrey.

Video footage recorded on a mobile phone by Betina Colunga shows the animal dodging traffic as it runs in front of her car before carrying on down the road.

She said: 'I don't know if I would have believed it myself if I hadn't taken the video.'

A spokesman for the circus confirmed that the animal had briefly left the enclosure where it had been sunbathing after a keeper left a gate open.

But they initially denied that the giraffe had gone very far until confronted with the video. 

A taxi driver complained to local media that he had almost run into the giraffe.

He doubted his insurance company would have believed him had he made a claim for any damage.

The circus spokesman said: 'We usually allow the giraffe into an open enclosure to enjoy the sun but on this occasion it did briefly leave the enclosure when the door was left open. But unfamiliar with the area, it quickly returned to the enclosure without any problems.'
