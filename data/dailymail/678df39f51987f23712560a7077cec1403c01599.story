Arsene Wenger has called on Arsenal to prove they are not bully victims at Everton on Saturday.

Wenger’s side suffered a 3-0 defeat at Goodison Park in April, a result that raised serious question marks over their attempts to qualify for the Champions League.

Arsenal did, however, go on to make the top four, at the expense of Roberto Martinez’s side.

It was not so much the loss to Everton, but the manner of the defeat that irked Wenger in the days after.

‘It was a low point of last season, yes,’ admitted Wenger.

‘In the quality of our performance, and even more than that in mental resistance, the mental steel on the day.

‘That was one of our low points. We were a bit bullied. It was an off day physically.’

The Gunners can expect more of the same on Saturday, but Wenger wants his team to prove they are no longer a soft touch.

‘Many teams think that they can bully us. We get that question many times,’ said the Frenchman.

‘But if you look at the results from the last three or four years away from home, we are the team with the best away results.

‘It’s true we are a bit more lightweight than before. On Fridays when we checked the weight it was quite something.

‘But you always want to improve technically and sometimes when you want to do that you go a bit more for skill, which can be more lightweight.

‘At the time when Vieira left we had [Cesc] Fabregas, who was 17 years old. You cannot say you are not heavy enough so you cannot play — he had the quality to play.’

Arsenal full back Mathieu Debuchy believes Arsenal will take a big step forward once World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Mesut Ozil and Lukas Podolski are fully reintegrated in the squad, starting on Saturday.

‘When I see the squad now and I think that Ozil, Mertesacker and Podolski are still missing, it is incredible. It is an amazing squad,’ he said.
