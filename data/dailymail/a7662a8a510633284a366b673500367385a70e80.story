The biennial event, which celebrates traditional Maori performing arts, is currently taking place at Hagley Park in Christchurch, New Zealand.

This year, 45 teams from New Zealand and Australia are showcasing their talents and competing for the title of national kapa haka champion.

From March 4 through March 8, thousands of kapa haka performers will perform in a culmination of years of passionate commitment, dedication and hard work.

The competition itself is broken down into three pools: Te Ihu, Te Haumi and Te Kei. 

The three teams that receive the highest combined marks from each pool will compete again, against each other in the finals.

Judges will then determine the new Toa Whakaihuwaka, the overall aggregate winner, from those final nine teams.

Beginning on March 5, the competition pools began their initial rounds of performances.

Kapa haka teams must perform six disciplines within their piece: whakaeke (a choreographed entry), moteatea (a traditional chant), poi (a demonstration of a light ball swung on the end of a rope), waiata-a-ringa (an action song), haka and whakawatea (exit).

During each team's 30 minute performance, each discipline must be delivered in a perfect, polished manner.
