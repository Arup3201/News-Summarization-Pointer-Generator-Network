Onlookers watched as a bouncer checked Matthew's pulse as he looks dazed - moments before he was rushed to hospital.

Matthew Leach, who took the shocking photo, said he was walking through Lincoln city centre moments after the brutal assault.

He said: 'I didn't see the incident itself, just the aftermath.

'There were about four or five bouncers surrounding the bloke and talking to him to reassure him and keep him awake.

'It's not the sort of thing you expect to see on a night out for sure.'

Matthew, a first team loose-head prop 
for Scunthorpe Rugby Club, had been on a night out in Lincoln when he 
was attacked at about 12.50am.

He
was taken to Lincoln County Hospital before being transferred 50 miles 
to a specialist brain unit at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in 
Sheffield.

Surgeons spent an hour removing the hammer from his skull and yesterday he was described as being in a stable condition.

His distraught girlfriend Elisha Davis wrote on Facebook thanking well-wishers for messages of support.

She
said: 'Just to let everyone know Matthew Probert seems to be making a 
good recovery, for anyone asking about visiting, hospital staff and 
family request no visitors for the time being but will let everyone know
when he is well enough!'

Elisha's sister Tara added that Matthew was in a stable condition but was being closely monitored by nursing staff.

She wrote: 'Op went well. He had spoken and speech has not been affected. Now under observation and watching for signs of infection.

'Sleeping at present but nurses waking every hour. He is lucky to be alive - can't believe it!'

A spokesperson from SSE National League Three (Midlands) club Scunthorpe RC said their thoughts were with Matthew and his family.

He said: 'We were shocked to hear what had happened to Matt - he's a popular lad and well-respected at the club.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family and we wish him a speedy recovery.'

Lincolnshire Police said a 21-year-old man from the city was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and is being questioned in connection with the attack.

The incident took place in the Hungate area of the city near Revolution Bar and Home nightclub.

Detective Inspector Katrina Morton appealed for witnesses or anyone with information about the incident to come forward.
