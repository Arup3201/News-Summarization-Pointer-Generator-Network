Sky Sports pundit Chris Kamara chased down and apprehended a robber in dramatic scenes on the streets of Rio.

The former footballer posted images of the incident as it unfolded on Twitter of a topless man being wrestled to the floor and handcuffed by two men after stealing a necklace.

Kammy took pride in his speed in catching the man but said he was 'done in' afterwards.

He wrote: ‘Not lost me pace!!! I just caught this street robber. Done in now though’.

Another photo was tweeted soon after of Kamara standing in front of the criminal, who is facing a fence in the background with his hands cuffed behind his back.

The 56-year-old was then told that he would need to provide a statement to the police, telling fans: ‘My good deed has back fired’.

Kamara seemed to enjoy the role of hero as he uploaded two more photos to the social media website, one of the criminal who he called his ‘prize catch’, and one of him conversing with a local policeman.

He joked: ‘Giving my statement now: “well I ran after him & caught him”’.

Kamara was then asked to go to the local police station to give a written account.

He joked with followers by tweeting: 'Will they let me out!!!'

He added: 'Police & British Consulate in Brazil have politely told me off, a lot of these guys are armed! So don't chase again.'

An hour later he told fans he was still waiting to leave, writing: 'Still in the Cop Shop!! Come on fellas let me go, god knows what it said on the paperwork I signed???'

But eventually Chris and a friend were allowed to leave - with the necklace that was stolen in hand.

He wrote: 'Police got Mike's necklace off the robber & so we declined to press charges. So all is well that ends well.'

With Kamara’s biography on Twitter 
reading, ‘ex-footballer, ex-manager, current TV presenter, football 
pundit and a bit of a singer too!’, he will now be able to add 
‘crime-fighter’ to his repertoire.
