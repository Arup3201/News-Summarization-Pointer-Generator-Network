There will be plenty of pats on the back for England after a convincing Six Nations campaign but now is actually the time to be very tough with each other.

Stuart Lancaster’s team have taken huge strides forward over the past six weeks, both in the ambition of their attacking game and in the quality and skill of their execution. They, and especially Lancaster, deserve huge credit for their continued progress towards next year’s World Cup.

But the brutal truth that they must all take on board is that England have finished second in the table for a third year running and it is not going to get any easier.

Work to do: Stuart Lancaster and England have taken huge strides in this Six Nations, but they still only managed a second placed finish

Champions: Ireland capped Brian O'Driscoll's final championship with a memorable victory

At the weekend, with the trophy to play for, England were playing the poorest team of the tournament who were out on their feet. By half-time Italy were on the ropes but England lacked the killer instinct  to finish them off. This is now the next vital step in the development of this very talented team.

There comes a point when the focus must move away from selection to how we are playing the game — and the coaches and players need to look at how to play the last quarter of matches.

You need your best 15 players on the field during the most crucial period, but  England lost the Six Nations because of the way they handled the last five minutes against France and the final 15 against Italy. They could easily have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes against Italy.

I still fear England are losing so much by changing key players in key moments and the substitution policy is the one area in which I really disagree with the coaching team. The fact remains England never have their best team on the pitch when the final whistle blows.

Hauled off: Luther Burrell was substituted after just 53 minutes

Chance: England could have scored three tries in the final 10 minutes - but their strongest line-up was not on the field

I was stunned to see Luther Burrell brought off after 53 minutes. He was one of the outstanding players in the first half. He stays on his feet longer than Manu Tuilagi in contact and sucks in defenders before looking to offload. He was pumped up, playing out of his skin and he had earned the right to exploit those gaps against a tiring team.

Players learn crucial things during a game and confidence grows, especially when they are so dominant. The defensive and attacking habits of your opposite man become clear during the heat of battle. Substitutes will add something individually but in terms of the collective you lose much of what you have been building.

I would have just loved to see the starting 15 finish the match. If the only changes had been for injury, what would the score have been on Saturday? This game was all about winning the tournament, not about developing your squad.

Pumped up: Burrell had an excellent first half

Total: England scored 52 points but it wasn't enough

Be under no illusions, New Zealand this summer is a huge step up. The RBS 6 Nations is a fantastic tournament, but the standard of rugby will not have the Southern Hemisphere teams quaking just yet —and certainly not the All Blacks.

New Zealand still play the game a yard quicker — from the basic speed of passing in moving the ball away from contact to the speed of the back row getting over the ball at the breakdown. A lot of England’s players will have never played in New Zealand before and if you get caught in the headlights it can get very ugly very quickly.

This is where England’s attitude is crucial and the likes of Owen Farrell, Mike Brown and Dylan Hartley are priceless. If you do not have a bit of that edge when you get off the plane down there it is guaranteed you will get smashed.

Lancaster has a get-out-of-jail-free card with his first fixture because he is without players involved in the Premiership final but in their final two Tests England have an opportunity to make a real statement.

England’s fitness still concerns me and we are some way short from the overall fitness of England’s players at the turn of the  millennium. When was the last time Hartley played 80 minutes?

Individually, every player has to utterly commit to England with the ambition to ensure we arrive at the World Cup as the fittest and most powerful team in history. That must be worked on by players every day behind the scenes.

Lying in wait: England face Dan Carter and the mighty New Zealand this summer

Needed: England need Ben Youngs to come back to his best and pressure Danny Care

That should also inspire players on the cusp of the squad or fighting to get back in.

Somewhere back in Leicester, Ben Youngs will be seething, but England need him to get back to his best to pressure Danny Care.

First-choice players need to  be under constant pressure to keep their place. This has been a  fantastic tournament for Care and Farrell. But you need pressure in all positions.

France were one forward pass from handing the title to England and that trophy can transform the stature of a team.

I was in a packed hotel bar in Rome on Saturday and English fans were screaming for France. I never thought I’d see that and I must confess to not being one of those! What would have happened if England had kicked off third on Saturday with an exact target to go for? Would the substitutions or the tactics have been different?

Would they have played with more urgency in the last quarter? Would the mindset have changed? If the answer is yes, then that explains the next stage of the team’s development. A winning mentality is about being ruthless in achieving your targets.

Congratulations to Ireland, I did not think they quite had the firepower to go to Paris and beat a desperate France, but what a  wonderfully deserving send-off for Brian O’Driscoll. In his final 12 months as a professional player he has won a Lions series and a Six Nations trophy.

Wales have been a shadow of the team they were before the Lions tour but they will bounce back. They still have very good players and coaches and everyone in Wales needs to regroup behind Warren Gatland and Sam Warburton.

Regroup: Wales are a shadow of their former selves and need to regroup behind Sam Warburton and Warren Gatland

Triple Crown — I didn’t even realise there was a trophy. It’s a nonsense.

Tired legs — If a team or individual has tired legs, or needs ‘fresh legs’, they should not have started.

Ball Carrier — Everyone carries a ball. A phrase created for unimaginative players who just smash into people.

I fear England are changing too many key players at key moments - their best players need to be on the field when the whistle blows
