It’s a radical aircraft design that could one day see passengers flying in circles.

Airbus has filed a patent application for an unusual concept plane that has been dubbed a ‘flying doughnut’.

Instead of queuing on a jet bridge, passengers would board the UFO-like aircraft at ground level via an escalator and an ‘access hatch’, and they would enjoy more space on flights.

'Flying doughnut': This drawing shows Airbus' concept for a new aircraft with a circular cabin

The futuristic plane has a circular cabin with curved aisles and a hole in the middle, giving it the shape of a doughnut.

Passengers in economy would be seated in the outer ring, while business seating would be located within the inner ring.

The unconventional aircraft, shaped like a Stealth Bomber, would be lighter and have more cabin space for travellers while solving a long-standing problem related to cabin pressure.

According to a 15-page patent application filed late last month, the concept plane would be free from the stress that cabin pressure places on cylindrical aircraft, meaning it would be more economic and efficient.

Conventional planes have sealed bottoms with heavy fasteners to withstand the loads induced by cabin pressurisation.

In its patent filing, the France-based manufacturer wrote: ‘The present invention proposes an aircraft wherein the structure delimiting passenger cabin extends over 360 degrees around a space defined outside structure.

‘The invention allows structure to be more resistant to loads induced by the cabin pressurization, while allowing to reduce or even to avoid the need for a sealed bottom.’

Airbus spokesman Justin Dubon told NPR that the design may never be in production as the company files over 600 patent applications every year.

He said: ‘Some of these become the seed for other ideas with practical use.’

Airbus has come out with a number of futuristic concepts, including a virtual reality isolation helmet

The France-based manufacturer has patented a design for benches with bicycle-like saddle seats

Airbus, which manufactures the A380, the world’s largest passenger plane, has patented a number of futuristic concepts that may never materialise.

One of them is a virtual reality isolation helmet, which looks like a prop from a Star Wars film.

With comfort in mind it would cancel out peripheral noise – including crying children or chatty adults – and allow passengers to immerse themselves in in-flight entertainment.

Each headset would come with a built-in video screen, glasses for better viewing, earphones and a mini-airbag to protect the head during extreme turbulence.

Other concepts include windowless cockpits, benches with bicycle-like saddle seats and an external audio system that would mimic bird noises to prevent bird strikes.
