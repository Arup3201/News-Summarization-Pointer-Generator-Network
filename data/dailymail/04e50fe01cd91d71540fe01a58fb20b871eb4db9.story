The Queen made a rare appearance at the funeral of a so-called commoner today as she attended the service held in honour of Baroness Thatcher at St Paul's cathedral.

Baroness Thatcher was the Queen's eighth and longest serving prime minister and the former PM's  friends and allies were said to be delighted the monarch decided to attend.

Traditionally the Queen does not attend funerals of so-called commoners. The only other time she has broken with tradition was in 1965 when she attended the funeral of Winston Churchill.

The Queen, wearing black wool coat and
hat with a triple string of pearls at her neck, sat with Prince Philip 
at her side as she listened to the heartfelt tributes paid to Britain's 
first female prime minister.

Fitting: Cabinet member Ken Clarke said it was 'entirely appropriate' that the monarch attended the funeral today

The decision for the Queen to attend was made last week at a top-level Government meeting to 
discuss plans for the farewell to the Iron Lady. 

Palace 
officials then confirmed the monarch would join mourners at St Paul’s Cathedral.

As reported by the Daily Mail's Royal Correspondent Rebecca English, the Queen and Margaret Thatcher, born six months apart, were two women very much making their mark in a man's world.

But, Rebecca says, the Queen is often said to have had a less than easy relationship with 
Margaret Thatcher, her eighth – and longest-serving – prime minister. 

'Always
mindful of her constitutional role and cordial to the last, the monarch
is nevertheless said to have personally disagreed with some of Mrs 
Thatcher's more divisive policies and privately expressed her alarm over
issues such as unemployment and the miners' strike.'

Close relationship: The Queen and Baroness Thatcher met for weekly meetings while Thatcher was in power

Upon hearing the news of Baroness Thatcher's death two weeks ago, a Buckingham Palace spokesman issued a statement saying the monarch was 'sad to
hear the news of the death of Baroness Thatcher' and would be sending a
private message of sympathy to her family.

Inside the service today the Bishop of London paid tribute to this 'remarkable' woman who inspired many.

She had, he said, a great capacity to 'reach out to the young and to those who were not in the world's eyes important.'

He recalled her strength, power and dedication - and how she was affected by the loss of her beloved husband Denis.

He spoke of Baroness Thatcher's increasing debilitation, from which, he said, she is now liberated.

The congregation sang I Vow To Thee My Country before the Bishop of London spoke his final words of address.

Despite fears of dissent, the atmosphere outside the cathedral was by and large very positive. Those close to St Paul's had arrived very early in the morning - some staying overnight - to secure a spot nearby.

The crowds lining the streets, referred to as 'real True Bluers', gave out huge cheers as key Tories arrived - Lord Lamont and Boris Johnson - but reserved their biggest cheers for the Chelsea Pensioners and Lord Tebbit.

Respect: The Queen's decision to attend was said to have delighted Thatcher's friends and allies

Born six months apart, they were two women very much making their mark in a man's world.

But
the Queen is often said to have had a less than easy relationship with 
Margaret Thatcher, her eighth – and longest-serving – prime minister.

Always
mindful of her constitutional role and cordial to the last, the monarch
is nevertheless said to have personally disagreed with some of Mrs 
Thatcher's more divisive policies and privately expressed her alarm over
issues such as unemployment and the miners' strike.

While the Queen may have found her first female 
prime minister somewhat frosty, Mrs Thatcher's respect and admiration 
for the monarch knew no bounds, not least because she had been raised in
an intensely patriotic family.

She
once told author Gyles Brandreth that the talk of a strained 
relationship with the Queen was ‘a lot of nonsense' and spoke with 
admiration about her commitment to the Commonwealth and armed services.

‘No one could curtsey lower than Margaret Thatcher,' said another former aide.

Inevitably, after 11 years of almost weekly meetings, the pair reached something akin to friendship.

Mrs
Thatcher was even said to have jokingly sent the monarch a pair of 
rubber gloves as a Christmas present after witnessing her doing the 
washing up following a barbecue at Balmoral without a pair. Other 
sources say it wasn't that the two women did not like each other, they 
were simply very different people.

The Queen is dry and rather witty in private, while Mrs Thatcher always had a tendency to hector, regardless of her audience.

In 1986, their relationship was put 
under the spotlight when The Sunday Times reported sources close to the 
Queen saying she was ‘dismayed' by ‘uncaring' Mrs Thatcher's refusal to 
impose sanctions on apartheid South Africa, a decision the monarch 
feared would split the Commonwealth.

The
story caused uproar. The monarch is required constitutionally to keep 
her opinions private. The quotes were subsequently attributed to the 
Palace's press secretary, Michael Shea. The Queen is said to have rung 
her prime minister to reassure her that her views were nothing of the 
sort.

If the relationship 
was never entirely easy, the two certainly never wavered in their mutual
respect. The Queen, in particular, is said to have admired Mrs 
Thatcher's grit, determination and enormous achievements.

After
her enforced resignation in 1990, the Queen awarded Baroness Thatcher 
the Order of Garter and the Order of Merit – neither of which has been 
offered to Tony Blair.

She was also a guest of honour at Baroness Thatcher's 80th birthday celebrations.

Fellow
guests were touched at the sight of the Queen taking the hand of the 
most influential woman in modern British politics as she gently raised 
her from a deep curtsey, before guiding the already frail baroness 
through the throng of assembled guests.
