Matthew Tvrdon pleaded guilty to killing Karina Menzies but denies her murder

A mother who saved her children from a terrifying hit-and-run rampage suffered from a crippling disease which meant she could not save herself.

Karina Menzies, 32, managed to throw her daughters to safety before she was hit by a van and killed in an unprovoked attack on Friday.

The mother-of-three could not run away from the vehicle because her legs had been severely weakened by a progressive nerve condition.

She was one of 14 pedestrians, including seven children, hit in the 30-minute spree of horror as a driver sped through suburban streets, mowing down families on their way home from school.

Last night, Miss Menzies’ brother Craig paid tribute to his ‘hero’ sister, saying: ‘She died saving her kids.

'She’s got them out of the way and, at the same time, put herself between them and the van to prevent it hitting them. She’s let the van take her.

‘She would have done this instinctively because that is the person my sister was. She was the bravest, kindest, most loyal person in the world and I can’t believe she’s gone.’

Mr Menzies addressed more than 200 friends and relatives who gathered yesterday to lay flowers and stage a vigil at the spot where his sister was hit.

While Miss Menzies reacted quickly to save her daughters, she could not escape the vehicle because her legs were weakened by Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, friends revealed.

The condition, which damages nerves outside the spine and brain, meant she would not have been able to get away from the oncoming van fast enough.

Friend Julie Crook said: ‘Karina 
saved her kids but she couldn’t run. She had CMT and it affected her 
hands and feet. She found it really hard to run. She was very unstable 
on her feet. She wouldn’t have been able to run away. She would have 
just fallen if she tried.’

Mrs Crook insisted her friend would not have thought of herself as a hero for saving her children.

‘She was very humble,’ she added. ‘She would have said: “I did what any mother would do.”’

A 31-year-old man was last night charged with the murder  of Miss Menzies as well as 13 counts of attempted murder following the suspected hit-and-run rampage in the Cardiff suburbs of Leckwith and Ely.

Officers are investigating the theory that the driver may have deliberately targeted mothers and children because he was angry after a row with his wife.

...before mounting the pavement. A 31-year-old man has been charged with the murder of Miss Menzies as well as 13 counts of attempted murder

He dumped his van and fled on foot but was arrested outside the Merrie Harrier pub in Llandough just minutes later.

There have been claims that the man reversed back over some of the people he hit and reports that he was carrying a weapon, thought to be a crook lock, which he allegedly used to batter some of those who had been knocked down.

While Miss Menzies is the only fatality, two others are in a critical condition in hospital and five children are receiving treatment.

Others hit include two schoolgirls aged around ten, who moments before had been browsing birthday cards in a shop; a mother and her son, who was riding a bike; and a couple who were seen on CCTV pushing their two-year-old in her pram moments before the van swerved across four lanes of traffic and mounted the pavement.

Adam Lewis, 23, was thrown to one 
side, and his partner Annie Jones, 22, has had to have surgery after 
breaking her leg. Their daughter was thrown into the air.

Mr Lewis claimed it appeared that the van had sped up and targeted them deliberately.

He added: ‘I saw the van coming in my peripheral vision but it was too late to do anything.

'I got pushed from behind with the wing mirror but unfortunately my partner and my baby took the brunt of it.

'My baby was face down on the pavement and my partner was holding her leg – it was broken.

'When I heard about [Miss Menzies], I thought: “That could easily have been us.” We are so lucky to be alive.’

His
 eyes filling with tears, he went on: ‘The person who did this to her 
and those poor children and all the other families should be given a 
death sentence for what he has done here. He is not fit to breathe the 
same air as us.’

Friends said Miss Menzies was a mother figure for her extended family after her own mother was murdered by her partner in 2004.

They
 added that despite the pain her condition caused her, Miss Menzies 
always remained positive but would have been embarrassed about being 
hailed a hero.
