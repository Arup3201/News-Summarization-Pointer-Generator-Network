Brazil superstar Neymar will miss the remainder of the World Cup with a broken bone in his back.

The 22-year-old, who had scored four times to lead his country to the quarter-finals, was carried off on a stretcher in the closing stages of Friday's 2-1 win over Colombia and taken to hospital.

And team doctor Rodrigo Lasmar told local media in Brazil that Neymar will not kick another ball at the finals, expecting his recovery period to be at least four weeks.

'It's not serious in the sense that it doesn't need surgery, but he'll need to immobilize it to recover,' he told SportTV. 'Unfortunately, he's not going to be able to play.

'The exact time (to play again) can be four to six weeks, but it is too early to confirm this. Let's wait for other tests. This is the first diagnosis we had. Initially, we know he will not be able to play.’

Neymar flew back to Rio de Janeiro from Fortaleza with the rest of his team-mates following the match and was then transported by ambulance to the team's training base at Teresopolis.

The Barcelona forward had been struggling
 in the build-up to the all-South American clash with thigh and knee 
strains but was passed fit to start.

But he was carried off three minutes from the end after Juan Zuniga's knee landed in his lower back leaving him in tears.

Zuniga said: 'It was a normal move. I never meant to hurt a player. I was on the field, playing for the shirt from my country, not without the intent to injure. I was just defending my shirt.'

Brazil manager Luiz Felipe Soclari, speaking before Lasmar's interview, said: 'I don't think he'll be able to play in the next match.

Bittersweet: The elation at the victory was soon dampened as news filtered through of Neymar's injury

'He has been sent to a private clinic with the doctor because he was kneed in his lower back. He was crying in pain. It won't be easy for him to recover based on the fact that it's a back injury and with the pain he's in. Let's hope everything goes OK.

‘It might be that he could play in the final but at this moment, the next match is on July 8, I don’t think it is likely he can do it. But he is young, he has energy, he leads his life the right way and does all the right things. Let’s wait for the examination and see if there is something in the next 48 hours that can be done. In my opinion it’s going to be difficult.

'Us and them played a violent game, It was a corner kick when Neymar went in front and he came to stop the ball, but the referee decided and there is no point thinking about a punishment.

'We just hope that it isn't serious. But we just hope that in two or three days he will be able to rejoin us.
