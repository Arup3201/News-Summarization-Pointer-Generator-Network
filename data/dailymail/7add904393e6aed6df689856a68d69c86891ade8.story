Changes to the law will see automatic jail terms for anyone caught carrying a knife for a second time

Criminals caught carrying a knife for the second time will face automatic jail sentences under plans to be backed by Conservative MPs in defiance of their Liberal Democrat colleagues.

In a significant fracturing of the coalition, David Cameron will next week urge Tories to vote for a toughening of punishments for repeat offences despite Nick Clegg's refusal to support the move.

Because of the Government split, ministers will abstain, but backbenchers and Parliamentary private secretaries, who are junior members of the Government, are being encouraged to back the change.

The decision means the reform will be implemented if, as is expected, it is backed by Labour MPs. It will the first time since the coalition was formed in 2010 that the Tories have forced through a change in the law while the Lib Dems vote against it.

A Government source said: 'The Conservatives have always made clear we want to do more to tackle knife crime. The Commons will vote next week on an amendment to jail people caught carrying a knife on more than one occasion.

'Conservative ministers support these plans in principle. But because this is not an agreed coalition policy, they will abstain in Tuesday's vote. However, other Conservative MPs will be free to vote as they wish and these new powers stand a good chance of becoming law.'

Mr Clegg was said to be 'bouncing off the walls' last month after secret Cabinet correspondence was leaked to the Daily Mail revealing senior Lib Dems were resisting Tory proposals to introduce punishments for repeat knife offences.

The Mail published a leaked letter to Mr Clegg from Lib Dem Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander rejecting plans to impose a mandatory six-month jail sentence on any adult convicted of a second knife offence as too expensive.

In another letter to the Deputy Prime 
Minister, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws said mandatory minimum 
sentences were 'too blunt an instrument' and said he was unwilling to 
support them.

The Deputy Prime Minister blamed the Tories for the highly unusual breach of Cabinet confidentiality, and Lib Dem sources said the Tories should 'examine their consciences' for engaging in political games in the aftermath of teacher Ann Maguire's killing. Tory sources said the proposal to tighten the law had, in fact, been under discussion for months in advance.

Labour MPs are also expected to vote for the changes after Ed Miliband said he supports tougher sentences

Conservative
 Cabinet ministers including Chris Grayling, the Justice Secretary, 
Theresa May, the Home Secretary, and Michael Gove, the Education 
Secretary and Philip Hammond, the Defence Secretary, have all lined up 
behind the plan for tougher knife laws. Kenneth Clarke, the veteran 
Cabinet minister, is understood to be the only senior Tory backing the 
Lib Dems, arguing judges' hands should not be tied.

Nick de Bois, the Conservative MP for Enfield North, has tabled an amendment to a crime Bill introduce automatic jail terms, which his colleagues are being urged to support. Backing from Labour will guarantee it is passed by the Commons next week.

Mr de Bois said only one in four of the 16,031 cases of knife possession last year resulted in immediate custody. 'I hope backbenchers from across the House will support this amendment and it can become law,' he said.

A senior Lib Dem source said: 'The Liberal Democrats have been clear from the outset that we do not agree with these proposals.

'As a result, all Liberal Democrat MPs, whether ministers or backbenchers will be voting against the amendment â€“ the parliamentary party is united on this.

'We believe in giving judges the flexibility to use their expertise and judgement, based on the facts of each case. Prison is often going to be the right option and violent offenders who are a danger to the public ought to be behind bars but that should be for judges to decide.'

Labour leader Ed Miliband said last month: 'I don't agree with Nick Clegg. I think we do need tougher penalties for knife crime. Labour has been consistently arguing that this is an issue that needs to be looked at and we definitely do want to use the legislation to strengthen the law, and we're definitely sympathetic to the issue of mandatory sentences after a second offence.'
