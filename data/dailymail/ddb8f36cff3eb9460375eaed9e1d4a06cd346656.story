Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho spent £32million in eight days to bring the pair of them to Stamford Bridge to strengthen his title bid - and so far the plan is working.

Since £21m was spent bringing Serbia midfielder Nemanja Matic back to his former club, Chelsea are unbeaten in their eight Premier League games, winning six, and have opened up a seven point gap at the top of the table. Crucially, in a tricky run of games for the Blues, Matic has been a key part in important wins over Manchester United, Manchester City, Everton and Tottenham.

£11m Egyptian Mohamed Salah may not be having the same impact at the moment, but the flying winger has shown huge potential in his three brief appearances.

Matic has been a revelation in central midfield, something Chelsea have been missing since the likes of Michael Ballack and Claude Makelele left, and Frank Lampard and Michael Essien's powers declined. He combines brute strength with intelligence and class on the ball and has earned rave reviews, especially for the way he out-played Yaya Toure in that win at the Etihad.

His performance that night earned him the nickname 'The Beast.'

'I saw something on the internet which said this about me,' says the 25-year-old in Chelsea Magazine. 'It’s very nice if the people think this about me because it would be a good nickname to have. I have to be like this because I play in a position where you have to be the beast!

'Of course, I am always very happy when people have nice things to say about me, and it’s a pleasure if they like the way I play. I wanted to show my quality and I know it was important to start well because that helped me to feel more comfortable.'

Pedigree: Salah scored three goals in four matches against Chelsea in the last two seasons

Salah has played just 60 minutes of football in west London but has shown his pedigree against Chelsea in recent seasons, with three goals in four appearances against them in his last two seasons.

The Egyptian is excited to be playing in England and has memories of watching Chelsea as a teenager.

'As a boy, I watched every Champions League game on the TV and saw many, many good players,' he says.

'I remember watching Chelsea play against Liverpool in the Champions League – a 4-4 draw but Chelsea went through.

'It was a really great game and it has been my dream to play in England – the Egyptian people want to see players in the Premier League and now they will see me playing at Chelsea, so there is more pressure on me.

'I hope I can now start to score for Chelsea, not against Chelsea,” he adds. 'I know it will not be easy to play every game for Chelsea because we have so many very good players in my position, but I hope to show how hard I work and then we will see.'

Spell away: Matic spent three years at Benfica before returning to Chelsea

Matic, of course, has taken an odd route to the Chelsea first team. After joining the Blues in 2009 from Slovak team MFK Kosice, he stayed at Stamford Bridge for two years making three appearances before moving as part of the deal that brought David Luiz to the club.

He flourished in Portugal, helping the Lisbon giants to the Taca da Liga cup and leading them to the Europa League final, where they were beaten by Chelsea.

His performances in the midfield won him the Portuguese Player of the Year award. Matic acknowledges that leaving Chelsea may have been the best thing for him.

'I feel different than I felt three years ago,' he says. 'I always believed I had the right qualities and style of play for the Premier League. Maybe if I stayed at Chelsea, I don’t play like I do now – maybe I play better, maybe I play worse, you never know.

'I learned a lot at Benfica, which is one of the biggest clubs in the world; not only how to play that central-midfield position, but I learned to play with pressure.

'Now it is very nice to be back. It’s a pleasure to be part of this team and to work with these players and coaches. All the people have been helping me since I came back and I’m very happy.'

Chelsea continue their title charge with a visit to Villa Park on Saturday evening.
