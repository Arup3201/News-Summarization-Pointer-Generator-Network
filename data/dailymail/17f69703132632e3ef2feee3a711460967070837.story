Wayne Rooney says he is working hard to impress Louis van Gaal as the former Dutch manager begins life at Manchester United.

The England forward told Manchester United's TV channel that the squad were all eager to show their new manager what they were capable of, after a disappointing campaign last year under David Moyes.

Rooney seemed excited by van Gaal's methods, praising the manager's 'different ideas' in his first few training sessions at the club.
