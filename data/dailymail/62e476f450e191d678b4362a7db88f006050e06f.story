Bubba Watson has a reputation of being a bit of a joker away from the golf course and the American golfer has filmed yet another hilarious video to make that assumption even more realistic.

The 36-year-old posted footage of himself putting a hole-in-one during an evening golf session before taking off his top to celebrate his triumph in true Watson style.

Watson tweeted the video to SportsCenter in hope that the account, which showcases sporting talent, would be posted to their 13.4million followers.

SportsCenter allow Twitter users to nominate a sportsman, by using the hashtag #SCtop10, for coverage on their page.

Watson says during the video: 'Hey SportsCenter. Yes, it is time for another Bubba Watson SportsCenter top 10,' before predicting he will putt a hole-in-one.

After his prediction comes to fruition, he looks into the camera and says 'you're welcome' before running around the course shirtless.

Watson, who has released comical music videos with fellow Golf Boys members Ben Crane, Rickie Fowler and Hunter Mahan, released a rap song shortly before Christmas which he named 'Bubba Claus The Single'.

The 2014 Masters winner blurted out lyrics such as: 'I just touched down on a hovercraft. I bet you want to know what’s in my bag.

'Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys? It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus.'

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus

I remember Christmas growing up in Bagdad

Chillin in the living room with my dad

Mama in the kitchen got food in the stove

Sister in the living room playing on the floor

I used to hit the golf course take me a swing

Got my first clubs this boy was a teen

Kids in their room can't even go to sleep

Cos they know I'm coming through putting gifts on a tree

No sled, no beard, no reindeer

I might come deliver gifts on a John Deere

KD asked me to bring him a new ball

But I'm checking ma list it's Bubba Claus

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus

I gotta big guy he's the reason I made it

I thank him every day for the moves that I make

Baby Jesus he was born in a manger

Cos he knew when I was born I was gonna be the saviour

Thank you for my clothes and the shoes on my feet

Thank you for my kids and the food that they eat

Thank you for my house and the house where we sleep

I wake up every day and put it on repeat

I just touched down on a hovercraft

I bet you want to know what’s in my bag

Is it golf clubs or a bag of toys?

It’s a bird, it’s a plane, it’s Bubba Claus
