Sydney may have impressively dropped 17 places out of the top ten of the world’s most expensive cities but it still remains a costly lifestyle for residents who live in Australia’s biggest city.

While it may not be a winner for Australians that the harbour city fell from nine in 2013 to 26 in Mercer’s 2014 Cost of Living Survey, it’s an attractive package for expatriates as the local currency has depreciated against the US dollar.

Australian cities have witnessed some of the most dramatic falls in the ranking this year with Melbourne also dropping 17 spots from 16 to 33 and Perth stepping down 19 places to 37, while Brisbane and Canberra both fell out of the top 50.

Mercer’s Talent Business Pacific leader Garry Adams said the latest Cost of Living Index results were promising for companies considering establishing headquarters in Australia or relocating expats.

‘The drop in rankings mean Australia becomes more attractive for global talent because ex-pats’ dollars will go further, it does not mean that Australian cities have become cheaper for Australians,’ he said. ‘Changes in the value of the Australian dollar against the US dollar are the primary reasons for the drop in our rankings.’

The strengthening of the Chinese yuan and currencies in Western Europe against the US dollar has also seen countries in these regions become more expensive, and drive Australian and New Zealand cities down the list.

Melbourne also dropped 17 spots from 16 to 33 but it doesn't make Australians' lifestyles any cheaper

Mr Adams said companies will find it easier to justify using one of the major Australian cities as a headquarter for their Asia Pacific operations

‘We know Australian cities are already a very attractive location for corporates due to our high quality of living, multicultural and multi-lingual workforce and Asian region time zone,’ he said.

‘The drop in costs means they become even more attractive as a location for global assignments.’

‘Compared to last year, where Sydney sat within the top 10 most expensive cities globally, we were looking at ensuring salaries adequately reflected the difference in cost of living to an employee’s home country in order to attract and retain talent,’ he said.

‘Now, we’re provided with a lot more flexibility in setting salaries and attracting employees from the global talent pool, knowing the expat dollar will go a lot further here.'

The survey covers 211 cities across five continents and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods, and entertainment

Perth, which dropped down 19 places to 37, is one of the cities that will look attractive to relocating expats and companies looking to operate in the Asia Pacific
