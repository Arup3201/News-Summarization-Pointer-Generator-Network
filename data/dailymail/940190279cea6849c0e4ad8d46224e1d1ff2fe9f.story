Guilty: MOD official Mark Scully found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman he offered to help after she missed her train station

A top Ministry of Defence executive has been  found guilty of sexually assaulting a woman after offering to find her a taxi home when she missed her train station.

Mark Scully, 37, pretended to be helping the business woman, who had fallen asleep on a train from London Waterloo to Surrey after a night out, but instead launched an attack on her, punching her in the face and choking her.

The married father-of-one, an assistant head of support for operations at the MoD, told concerned fellow passengers that he would escort the intoxicated 29-year-old to a cab at Woking station, but instead dragged her off the road.

The victim told Guildford Crown Court how he held her by the throat and punched her in the eye, telling her not to struggle but to ‘enjoy it’ before she managed to escape.

‘To passengers on the train he appeared as a knight in shining armour,’ Ruby Selva, prosecuting, told the jury.

Instead 6ft2in Scully, a high-ranking civil servant who advised Nato chiefs on reconstruction in Southern Afghanistan in 2009-10, guided the petite woman past the taxi rank at Woking Station and into a wooded area.

The prosecutor alleged he took advantage of her intoxicated condition to over-power her, calling it a 'violent and predatory attack.'

'The defendant had earlier spied her on 
the train - alone and vulnerable through drink - and had taken his 
opportunity,’ said Ms Selva.

The defendant, a former Territorial Army Captain and a qualified bomb disposal officer, from Pirbright, Surrey, throttled the woman and punched her in the eye to stop her struggling before penetrating with his fingers, the jury was told.

After the violent incident at Greenheys Place, Woking, the battered and bruised complainant ran screaming and sobbing to a nearby house to get help.

Scully consistently denied attempted rape and two offences of assault by penetration during the trial.

He was acquitted of attempted rape and one attempt of assault by 
penetration, but the jury found him guilty of one count of vaginal penetration.

Ms
Selva told the court that the complainant was so desperate to get away that she left one of her earrings, her 
mobile phone, one of her bags and her shoes at the scene of the attack.

The court was told that the incident took place in the early hours of July 27 last year after the complainant, 
caught a night train home from Waterloo intending to alight at 
Weybridge.

Assault: Scully attacked the 29-year-old business woman when pretending to help her get a taxi home from Woking Station in Surrey after she fell asleep on the train and missed her stop at Weybridge

Ms Selva said the victim had 'quite a lot to drink,’ and as a result fell asleep and missed her stop.

When fellow passengers noticed the sleeping woman, Scully,
who had also been drinking with his Ministry of Defence colleagues, said that if others would 
assist him in getting her off the train he would help her to get home.

After
the train stopped at Woking the defendant asked fellow passengers where
she had intended to get off and someone said ‘Weybridge’, it was 
claimed.

Ms Selva said witnesses described Scully as calm and reassuring, as he escorted her off the station telling her: ‘Don't worry’.

The complainant later told police: ‘I thought he was going to help me to get a taxi. I wouldn’t have trusted him otherwise’

But jurors heard that Scully guided her past a cab rank before bundling her into a wooded area,

The complainant said she was either pushed or thrown to the ground.

She told police: ‘I remember being held by my throat and told not to struggle. I realised 
that I had to stop fighting or I was going to die there.'

The
vicitm told police she was struggling to stop the assault but the 
defendant kept repeating ‘Just enjoy it. Just enjoy it.’

The victim lost her shoes during the attack and
sustained scratches from the undergrowth.

‘My head was all bumps,' she said. 'He punched me in the eye to keep me still.’

The victim told police that Scully began pleasuring himself, which gave her the opportunity to escape

‘I got up and ran away crying and screaming’, she said.

She reached a nearby house and woke up the occupant by exclaiming: ‘I've been raped!’

Attacker: Scully punched the woman in the eye and tried to strangle her while telling her to 'enjoy it'

The occupant described the woman as 'very distraught and crying a lot,' adding that she had a black eye and scratches.

‘She was crying and dishevelled. Her eye continued to swell and there were red marks on her throat’.

Ms Selva added that the victim was covered in scratches and had blood in her tangled hair.

The court heard that Scully was traced to his home after having taken a taxi there - and was arrested.

Jurors were told that the defendant told his wife Polly: ‘I met a woman on the train. Something happened between us and now she has alleged rape.’

He told detectives ‘I'm a bomb disposal officer.’

He said that he had escorted the woman out of Woking Station because he thought she lived nearby.

‘We bumped into each other and she started to kiss me,’ he said.

Scully told police that he used his fingers to penetrate the victim, whom he described as ‘pretty,’ as part of consenting sexual activity,

Then ‘It dawned on him what was happening’ and he decided to stop - but he claimed that she wouldn't let him go and bit him on the finger.

‘I was practically imploring her to let me go,’ said Scully.

He said he was left in agony after fighting to free his hand from her mouth - and lost one of his fingernails as a result.

‘It was really painful,’ Scully told the court.

He denied pleasuring himself. ‘I was shaking my hand because it really hurt,’ he added.

Scene: Scully dragged the woman into Greenheys Place near Woking station, where the attack took place in July last year

After the incident finished, he told the jury, he left the woman by herself and walked back to the Woking Station to get a taxi home.

He said hefelt ashamed that he had got involved in a casual sexual encounter when he was a happily married man with a young son.

Fighting back the tears, Scully todl the jury: ‘I'm extremely disappointed at the way I behaved that night. It was an extraordinary lowering of the standards I have. I really regret it.’

He added that he did not believe that the woman was hurt when he left her and he denied punching her.

Ms Selva said that that the woman's flight from the scene and the injuries she sustained were a clear demonstration that what had happened had been against her will.

The court was told that Scully, who graduated from Keele University in international relations, was an assistant head of a team of nine at the Ministry of Defence and in 2009/10 had been civil service advisor to a two-star army general in charge of 50,000 troops in Southern Afghanistan.

He said his wife Polly worked for the Ministry of Defence and was on loan to the Cabinet Office.

‘She's 12 weeks pregnant and has been in court to support me throughout all this,’ added Scully.

Scully, who had been suspended from his 
position at the MOD pending the outcome of the trial could face up to 
seven years, and will be sentenced Monday.
