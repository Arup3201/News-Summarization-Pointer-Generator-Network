Hunt: Arlene Arkinson, 15, pictured, disappeared after leaving a disco in Bundoran, County Donegal, in August 1994 and police resumed the search for her body today

A new search for the body of a missing Northern Ireland schoolgirl feared murdered 18 years ago has started, police revealed today.

Arlene Arkinson, 15, disappeared after leaving a disco in Bundoran, County Donegal, in August 1994.

Specialist search dogs are today being used to help officers check isolated land outside Castlederg, County Tyrone, where the teenager lived with her family.

'The sites to be covered in this phase of the search strategy have links to the overall investigation into Arlene’s disappearance and murder,' police said today.

'Searches will continue to be conducted on a planned roll-out, depending on weather conditions, availability of resources and operational commitments.

'Police would again thank landowners, in the public and private sectors, for their co-operation with the search operations,' the spokesman added.

The 61-year-old man who was with Arlene in the hours before she went missing was acquitted of her murder in 2005.

Robert
Howard lived close to Arlene’s home. He is now serving a life sentence 
for the murder and rape of a teenage girl whose body was 
found in a cement works in Northfleet, Kent, in March 2002.

Howard, who had a string of sex convictions stretching back to 1964, had strangled Hannah Williams, 14, with a 12-metre rope.

Miss Williams disappeared near her home in Deptford, south east London, in 2001.

He
is to be called to give evidence at a Belfast Coroner’s Court inquest 
into Arlene’s death after police review thousands of documents and 
papers linked to the investigation.

A preliminary date for the delayed 
hearing is in September.

Arlene’s sister Kathleen said this morning she would never give up hope of finding the body.

Previous police searches have centred on land close to the Donegal border.

'It has been so, so long, but I’ll never
give up. It has taken an awful toll on me, especially the delay in 
holding the inquest,' she said.

'You cannot keep playing with people’s minds like this. There are 
times when I just don’t want to leave the house, but I know the people 
involved in the search are doing their best. I appreciated that.'

Last year, murderer Howard failed in a High Court bid to block any Arkinson inquest being held as his legal team believed that the proceeding were designed just to undermine his acquittal.

In order to avoid being called he is understood to be planning another appeal.

A renewed call has been made for anyone with information about Arlene’s final movements to telephone 0845 600 8000.
