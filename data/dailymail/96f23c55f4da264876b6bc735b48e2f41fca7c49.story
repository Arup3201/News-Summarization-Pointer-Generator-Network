A Chinese Communist Party official has been sacked after images of him having sex with his mistress were posted on blogging websites.

Lei Zhengfu, a district party chief 
in the southwestern city of Chongqing, was fired after an investigation 
by the party's discipline watchdog confirmed that it was he who appeared
in the video, the state-run Xinhua news agency said.

The case highlights the influence of China's fast-growing blogging community, and the ruling Communist Party's increasing sensitivity to public anger over abuse of power, official impunity and corruption.

Screenshots from the sex video first appeared on Sina Corp's Weibo site on Tuesday.

The agency reported on Thursday that Lei had told a reporter the video, shot in 2007, was a fake.

The
party has stepped up its rhetoric against corruption, seeking to 
counter anger from citizens over regular reports of graft and debauchery
among officials - but efforts to root out the problem are reported to 
have been ineffective.

China was hit recently by controversy over the murder of Neil Heywood by Gu Kailai, wife of former Chongqing communist party chief Bo Xilai.

Bo, whose expulsion from the party overshadowed last week’s leadership transition, has been accused of engaging in ‘improper sexual relations with multiple women’, and other crimes.

Bo, who also faces possible charges of corruption and abuse of power, has yet to stand trial.

Net-savvy people in China have found a
potent weapon for fighting official corruption and abuse of power in 
microblogs like Weibo, which is similar to social networking sites Twitter and Facebook, and has had more than 420 million users at the end 
of the third quarter this year.

In September, another official, Yang 
Dacai, lost his job in the northwestern province of Shaanxi after 
Internet users compiled photos of him wearing several luxury watches 
that he was unlikely to be able to afford on a civil servant's salary.

A
month later, an urban management official in the southern province of 
Guangdong, Cai Bin, was sacked after online postings about him owning 22
homes.

Lei's sacking was among the most talked about topics on the hugely popular Weibo site on Friday.

Disciplined: The Communist Party held an internal investigation into the video after it was first posted

Bloggers: The sacking reveals the Chinese Government's growing sensitivity to public anger over perceived abuses of power in public office

The Chinese term for mistress — ;ernai,; or second wife — is thought to go back to the polygamous tradition that developed amongst some of the country's ruling elite during the country's imperial period.

Keeping a mistress is still viewed as a status symbol among some senior Chinese government officials and wealthy businessmen as has been revealed by recent scandals - including that of Lei Zhengfu.

Some Government ministers have been revealed to have had multiple mistresses. One former minister is believed to have had as many as 18 mistresses, according to the New York Times.

The women involved are often bought lavish gifts by their lover, from jewellery to luxury apartments and sports cars.

The issue has, however, led to a growing public backlash, as stories of the excesses involved have beaten the state's censors to been leaked onto the internet.
