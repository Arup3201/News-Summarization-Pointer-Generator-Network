'Not suicide': Candice Cohen-Ahnine, pictured with her daughter Aya, told relatives she felt threatened before she fell to her death in Paris

A mother who was involved in a bitter child custody battle with a Saudi prince she met in London has plunged to her death from a luxury apartment block.

Candice Cohen-Ahnine, 35, had told relatives 'I feel threatened' in the days before she fell from the fourth floor of the complex off the Champs Elysees in Paris.

Suicide has been ruled out, prompting fears that the tragedy may be connected to her dispute with Sattam al-Saud, a member of the hugely wealthy Saudi royal family.

The prince separated from Miss Cohen-Ahnine six years ago after an on-off relationship during which he had only allowed her fleeting meetings with their now 10-year-old daughter, Aya.

Miss Cohen-Ahnine was awarded custody of Aya by a French court earlier this year, but the prince had failed to hand over the girl before the mother died.

Miss Cohen-Ahnine had been due to visit her daughter in Saudi Arabia next month.

Today it emerged that Ms Cohen-Ahnine, a Frenchwoman whose original Jewish faith always caused tensions with the Muslim Saudis even after she converted, had complained of threats shortly before she died.

Police were reportedly investigating the theory that the woman fell while trying to get out of her flat 'as if she was escaping something dangerous'.

‘Candice’s custody battle with the Saudis was becoming increasingly bitter, but she was determined to get Aya back,’ said a source close to the police investigation into her death, which happened on Thursday.

‘A relative has confirmed that she complained of being threatened over the past few days.’

The
 claim was backed by Ms Cohen-Ahnine’s French lawyer, Laurence 
Tarquiny-Charpentier, who said: ‘What I can tell you is that it was not
 suicide'.

The lawyer added: 'She was a woman who was a real fighter and a very positive person, and plus, there were plans to see Aya in mid-September.

'That was her greatest motivation of all.'

Miss Cohen-Ahnine met the Saudi prince in 1998 at Browns nightclub in London, and their daughter was born in November 2001.

But the relationship broke down after
 Sattam al-Saud said he was obliged to marry a cousin in 2006, and Miss 
Cohen-Ahnine refused to be his second wife.

Relations became even more acrimonious in 2008 after Miss Cohen-Ahnine agreed to visit the Saudi capital Riyadh with her daughter.

Miss Cohen-Ahnine alleged that they were locked up in a palace and that she was also accused of being a Muslim convert from Judaism – a crime punishable by death in Saudi Arabia.

Miss Cohen-Ahnine was able to escape to the French embassy after a maid left her door open, and she eventually returned to France.

However, Aya remained in Saudi Arabia and Miss Cohen-Ahnine went on to express worry about her upbringing when she came across Facebook images of the girl wearing a niqab and playing with guns.

Miss Cohen-Ahnine wrote about her incarceration in a book called Give My Daughter Back, published last year.

She claimed she was locked in a room without any soap to wash with.

She
 said she was given rotten food and no drinking water, adding: 'When Aya
 managed to escape from her room to bring me a piece of bread or a bit 
of toothpaste, she was hit in front of me.'

In January a Paris criminal court ordered Sattam al-Saud to hand Aya back and pay child custody of some £8,000 a month.

The prince, who faced an 
international arrest warrant for ignoring the custody terms, denied he 
had ever ‘kidnapped’ his own daughter, saying: ‘She was free to come and
 go as she pleased.’

However, after the hearing, the 
prince was reported to have told Nouvel Observateur magazine: 'If need 
be, I’ll go like [Osama] bin Laden and hide in the mountains with Aya.'

He added before Miss Cohen-Ahnine’s death: ‘France has not got a right to take her back.

2001: Their daughter, Aya, is born.

2006: The couple break up after the prince claims he must marry a cousin and Miss Cohen-Ahnine refuses to be his second wife.

2008: Miss Cohen-Ahnine and Aya visit the Saudi capital Riyadh, where the mother claims they are locked up in a palace. Miss Cohen-Ahnine manages to escape, but Aya remains with her father.

2009: A child custody battle between the feuding parents begins.

2011: Miss Cohen-Ahnine attacks her former partner in a book entitled Give My Daughter Back.

January 2012: A French criminal court awards custody of Aya to Miss Cohen-Ahnine, but the prince fails to comply with the order.

August 2012: Miss Cohen-Ahnine falls to her death from a luxury apartment block in Paris.

'She is a Saudi citizen and a princess. They cannot oblige a princess to leave this country.’

Miss Cohen-Ahnine died from her injuries at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital in Paris after the fall in the Rue Chambiges.

Initial
 investigations by the Paris prosecutor suggest that she had been trying
 to get into a neighbouring flat through an open window – suggesting she
 had been trying to escape.

Witnesses heard the drama, but did not intervene, a police source added, with Ms Tarquiny-Charpentier saying he spoke to Miss Cohen-Ahnine ‘a few hours’ before and ‘she was fine’.

She had been due to travel to Riyadh in September, and was likely to have had her daughter back ‘within a month’, added Ms Tarquiny-Charpentier.

Autopsy results will be released later this week, and they may throw further light on exactly what happened.

Aya, meanwhile, remains in Saudi Arabia with her father, who is yet to comment on Ms Cohen-Ahnine’s death.

Jean-Claude Elfassi, who co-wrote Miss Cohen-Ahnine's book, wrote an online tribute to her and criticised the French authorities for failing to enforce the court order.

He wrote: 'I can only express my disgust at the slow pace of the judge in charge of his case that, three years after the commencement of the trial, has not yet issued an arrest warrant against... Prince Saud al Sattam.'
