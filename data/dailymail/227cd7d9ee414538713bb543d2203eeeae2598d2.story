Olympic and US Open tennis champion Andy Murray was given a hero's welcome when he made a triumphant return to his home town today.

Crowds packed into the bunting-lined streets of Dunblane, near Stirling, with Scottish flags and homemade placards congratulating the town's favourite son.

Thousands cheered and chanted his name after waiting hours in wet weather. They were rewarded for their patience, with Murray appearing to sign as many autographs as possible as he slowly walked along through the town.

Before his return home, Murray said: 'I can't wait to get back to Dunblane to where it all began and share my US Open victory with everyone and thank them for all the support.

'It's definitely going to be emotional, but it's a very special place for me.'

Murray did not attend Friday's official victory parade for Scotland's Olympians and Paralympians in Glasgow, having been advised to take a couple of days of complete rest at home after playing continuously for four months.
