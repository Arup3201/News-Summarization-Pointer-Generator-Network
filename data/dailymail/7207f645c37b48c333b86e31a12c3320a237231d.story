Is Raheem Sterling the best youngster in Europe?

Brendan Rodgers wants Liverpool to smash through the 100-goal barrier after they moved within touching distance of their first title since 1990.

Liverpool opened a five-point lead on second-placed Chelsea with three games to go by beating Norwich 3-2 at Carrow Road thanks, in part, to an outstanding display from Raheem Sterling.

Rodgers described the England forward as ‘arguably the best young player in Europe’ after he scored twice and set up the other for Luis Suarez, who became the first Liverpool striker since Ian Rush in 1986 to score 30 league goals in a season.

They were made to fight for their 11th straight win by Norwich’s spirited comeback but Rodgers said: ‘It was an incredible victory and big congratulations to the players. That means we can’t finish lower than third, which guarantees Champions League football. I don’t think anybody would have expected that and it shows the effort we’ve put in and the quality we’ve shown. We still have other goals. We’ve scored 96 now. When I came in 20 months ago we’d scored 47.

'It shows the 
attacking set-up and mentality and how much we've improved. We want to 
be one of the few teams to score 100 Premier League goals. We're looking
 forward to next week. There should be a great atmosphere inside 
Anfield.'

Chelsea are the only team to have reached a century of goals in a Premier League season, scoring 103 in 2009-10.

Rodgers, who 
revealed he used some powerful words from Margaret Aspinall - the chair 
of the Hillsborough Families Support Group - to inspire his player, had 
special words of praise for 19-year-old Sterling.

'If
 he doesn't win Young Player of the Year, I'll be shocked,' said 
Rodgers. 'He's always had the talent but I've been really pleased with 
his maturity. He's put an awful lot of time into his work.

'We've
 tried to play him in different positions to improve his intelligence. 
He's got that belief he can be a really good player and he's really 
humble.'

There is no sense 
Rodgers is feeling the weight of expectation bearing down on him as 
Liverpool close in on the Barclays Premier League trophy and he says he 
is relishing the responsibility.

'We
 had the Hillsborough Memorial Service last week which was really 
touching,' said Rodgers. 'We used some words from Margaret, the words 
she said about stress and how it can prove difficult but also give you 
determination to fight.

'Before the game we stuck those words on the 
wall. This is a club that is one with those who fought to achieve their 
ultimate goal. We've tried to do it in the right spirit, playing 
attacking football, with a team set up to attack.'

Liverpool
 needed to dig in towards the end, as Norwich pegged them back with 
goals from Gary Hooper and Robert Snodgrass; their performance left 
manager Neil Adams optimistic about their hopes of beating the drop.

'We'll
 go out to get nine points,' said Adams, whose side have to face 
Manchester United, Chelsea and Arsenal. 'The belief is there that we can
 get enough points to stay in the division. Our supporters are with us 
all the way.'
