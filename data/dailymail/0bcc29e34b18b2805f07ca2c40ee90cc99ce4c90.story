Zoraida Sambolin posted this picture of her recovery alongside fiancé Kenny Williams

CNN anchor Zoraida Sambolin is undergoing the first stage of her reconstruction following her double mastectomy last month.

Sambolin, 47, who anchors CNN's Early Start, updated her fans on her health yesterday and posted a picture of herself and fiancé, White Sox Executive Vice President Kenny Williams, with a bandage around her chest.

She revealed she was undergoing the same procedure as Angelina Jolie while discussing the Hollywood star on her show.

Sambolin was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent the double mastectomy last week.

She told viewers in May that she felt able to share her illness after Jolie announced she was having a double mastectomy.

She posted the picture of her recovery on her Facebook account yesterday.

Sambolin said: 'Good Morning Friends! First look at reconstruction stage one.

'My amazing fiancée on daily drain duty, documenting fluid output. Loving support is key.'

Dozens of people took to Facebook and Twitter to congratulate Sambolin on her bravery and wish her well in her recovery.

Francesca Romero, who wrote that she is due to have mastectomy this month, wrote: 'You have given me strength.'

Randy Egge wrote: 'I think it's great that you are sharing this experience. Surely, you will help numerous people with their own struggles because of how you handled yours.'

Sambolin told CNN viewers last month that - like Jolie - wanting to be there for her children helped her make the decision to have a double mastectomy.

She wrote on Facebook after the show: 'I struggled for weeks trying to figure out how tell you that I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and was leaving to have surgery then Angelina Jolie shares her story of a double mastectomy and gives me strength and an opening.'

Jolie revealed that she was forced to
make the agonizing decision to have a preventative double mastectomy, 
after tests showed she had an 87 per cent chance of contracting cancer.

Angelina Jolie made her first public appearance following her announcement about her procedure when she attended the premiers of her partner Brad Pitt's film World War Z in London and Paris

She told reporters that Pitt had helped her through the treatment and said she was grateful for support

Angelina's mother Marcheline Bertrand died from ovarian cancer at 56. When Angelina discovered her mother's cancer was hereditary, she said that she decided to reduce the risk

Jolie made her first public appearance last week after opening up about her experience in the New York Times when she announced she underwent the procedure in April after learning she is a carrier of the BRCA1 cancer gene.

The 37-year-old's mother Marcheline 
Bertrand died at the age of 56 from ovarian cancer and her aunt also died of breast cancer in the past month.

Jolie attended the London and Paris premiers of partner Brad Pitt's World War Z movie.

She told reporters: ‘I feel great, I feel wonderful and I’m very very grateful for all the support, it means a lot to me.

‘[Pitt's] been extraordinary. He’s such a wonderful man and a wonderful father, I’m very very lucky,' she said, praising her future husband, Brad, for his support during her treatment.

‘I’ve been very happy just to see the discussion about women’s health expanded and that means the world to me.’

The star's surgery was successful and
doctors say Angelina's chances of developing breast cancer have now 
lowered to less than five per cent.

Writing in an editorial piece entitled 'My Medical Choice', Jolie said: 'On a personal note, I do not feel 
any less of a woman.

'I feel empowered that I made a strong 
choice that in no way diminishes my femininity.'

And she added that she had wanted to speak out about her experience so that other women could consider their options.

'I
am writing about it now because I hope that other women can benefit 
from my experience,' she wrote.

'Cancer is still a word that strikes 
fear into people’s hearts, producing a deep sense of powerlessness.

'But
today it is possible to find out through a blood test whether you are 
highly susceptible to breast and ovarian cancer, and then take action.'
