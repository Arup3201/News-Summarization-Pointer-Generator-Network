The number of migrants in England and Wales has doubled over the past decade, census figures have revealed.

They now make up one in eight of the population after more arrived between 2001 and 2011 than in the previous five decades put together.

The number living in the country is now 7.5million.

Top ten: 7.5million immigrants live in Britain, 13% of the total population, with these countries making up half the number

More than half of those arrived over the ten years since 2001, according to a national census analysis published yesterday.

The figures show 3.8million people 
came to Britain from abroad in the period – more than the 3.7million who
 came during the previous 50 years.

The breakdown comes  from an analysis of the ten-yearly census carried out in March 2011.

The figures have already revealed 
that at the time there were almost half a million more people living in 
the country than previously suspected.

The latest analysis provides a fresh 
illustration of the impact of the wave of immigration under the 
governments of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.

They come in the week former minister
 Lord Mandelson acknowledged the scale of migration encouraged by Labour
 had made life difficult for people who are now hard-pressed to find or 
keep jobs.

He said that in 2004 ‘we were sending out search parties for people to come’.

Coming to Britain: Huge numbers of Poles came to live here during a major European influx between 2001 and 2012

Sir Andrew Green of MigrationWatch 
said: ‘It is simply astonishing that the number of immigrants in the 
country should have been allowed to double in ten years.’

There were more than 4.6million people born abroad and officially considered to be immigrants in 2001.

Around 900,000 of them died, returned to their countries of origin, or moved on elsewhere over the subsequent decade.

Heavy responsibility: New data shows that 177,000 are young carers, broken down here by age range

Data: The children are caring for family, loved ones and others, the Census data shows

Damning: The children forced to care for family or guardians will often end up with lower paid jobs

According to the breakdown, nearly a 
third of the current immigrant population of the country arrived in just
 five years between 2004 and 2009 –  the years after Poland and seven 
other Eastern European countries joined the EU.

About 2.4million people came to 
Britain over the five-year period, during which Labour ministers had 
predicted that Eastern European migrants would come at the rate of 
13,000 a year.

The decade after 2001 also saw high immigration from countries outside Europe.

‘Over half of all residents born in Nigeria, South Africa and the United States arrived since 2001,’ the ONS report said.

‘For residents born in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh the decade 2001-2011 also had the highest percentage of arrivals.

‘By contrast 60 per cent of Jamaican-born residents arrived before 1981.’

Shocking picture: New Census data has shown the number of unpaid carers, which includes 177,000 under sixteens

Significant: Millions are giving up their time, often more than 50 hours per week, to look after a parent, sibling or loved-one
