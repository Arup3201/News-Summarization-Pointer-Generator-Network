Coleen Rooney shows she is well and truly back as she flaunts her incredible post-baby body in her latest range for Littlewoods.com.

The mother-of-two, 27, gave birth to son Klay just six months ago but looks slimmer than ever modelling her new partywear range.

With her hair styled in a loose, side-parted style and natural-toned make-up, she lets the figure-hugging clothes speak for themselves with just a few pieces of statement jewellery to complement the looks.

Just in time for Christmas, the stylish and affordable collection includes something for every age, shape - and budget.

The looks in the range include a black knee length dress with flattering V neckline and sheer panels at the hem, and tough PU leather detail tee paired with festive silver brocade skirt.

A sequin maxi dress also features as a standout piece, along with faux fur collard coat 
and edgy black and blue stripe bodycon dress.

Princes start at a purse-friendly £27.

'A party dress should make you feel special but also be something you feel comfortable in,' says Coleen.

'I always design with real women of all different shapes and sizes in mind as it's essential to me that there is a piece that works for everyone. I have thought about every detail in this latest collection and feel it's my best yet.'

The
 designer has been working with the leading online retailer since 2010 
and releases her festive range just as party season approaches.

'Our customers relate to Coleen as a stylish young mum,' Gary Kibble, Retail Brand Director, Littlewoods.com.

'She always ensures that her collections include pieces for every woman and it is this attitude to her designs that wins her the hearts of the Littlewoods customer.'

Coleen just launched a range of jewellery for Littlewoods.com, creating a range of attention-grabbing pieces for the party season.

Items include chunky two-tone watches, stacking rings and bangles studded with colourful gems.

Last night, she stepped out flaunting her amazing post-baby body on a night out in Manchester, the city where husband Wayne currently plays for Manchester United.

The mother to sons Kai and Klay was spotted leaving the Neighbourhood Bar & Restaurant at 2am.
