THE CAT’S OUT OF THE BAG: TRUTH AND LIES ABOUT CATS

by Max Cryer

(Exisle £9.95)

Within his satirical lexicon The Devil’s Dictionary, the 19th-century American satirist Ambrose Bierce impertinently defined a cat as ‘a soft, indestructible automaton provided by nature to be kicked when things go wrong in the domestic circle’.

This outrageous calumny, evidently the work of a dog-lover, appears in a new celebration of feline trivia and folklore gathered by Max Cryer.

In his introduction, Cryer writes that it takes a while for cats to train humans to provide for their needs and not expect anything in return. Anyone who has ever become a willing slave to an exigent feline will know exactly what he means.

The innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language

But perhaps it isn’t quite fair to say that cats offer nothing in exchange for the food, warmth and adoration bestowed on them by their besotted owners.

Dogs may claim the title of man’s best friend, but anyone who has lived with a cat knows they are simply too cool to want to be friends with humans. People who love cats find their aloofness captivating and their beauty irresistible.

The most battle-scarred old moggy, prowling the garden wall in search of a fight, moves with the instinctive grace of a tiger.

And it is no accident that cats, rather than any other creature, were considered sacred by the Ancient Egyptians.

There is an enigmatic quality to the feline bearing that no dog could hope to emulate.

The innate mysteriousness of cats has spawned a wealth of cultural references in language, literature, movies and even music.

(If you have never heard Rossini’s Cat Duet, as sung by Felicity Lott and Ann Murray, check out the blissfully funny YouTube video of them performing it at the Proms.)

True to their insinuating nature, cats turn up in the most unexpected of places. There are none in the Bible (though dogs, cattle, donkeys, lions, horses and chickens all feature in scripture).

But Shakespeare’s works include 42 mentions of cats, and not all of them entirely complimentary.

Among the most beloved of literary cats are the benevolently grinning Cheshire Cat from Alice’s Adventures In Wonderland; Mehitabel, the fictional alley cat whose adventures with her best friend, a cockroach called Archy, were the subject of a series of newspaper columns by the American journalist Don Marquis; and Tobermory, the devastatingly eloquent feline hero of a comic short story by the Edwardian writer Saki.

Literary-minded cat-lovers cherish Edward Lear, whose boldly striped cat Foss appears in many of his illustrated nonsense rhymes, while Beatrix Potter’s books for children contain some vividly characterful cats, including the distracted single mother Tabitha Twitchit and her wayward son, Tom Kitten.

In film, cats prove unexpectedly willing to take direction.

Movies with feline stars include the Bond films, in which the villian, Blofeld, is often shown stroking his pet, a blue-eyed white Angora; Breakfast At Tiffany’s, in which a marmalade cat known only as Cat starred alongside Audrey Hepburn’s Holly Golightly; and the Coen brothers’ 2013 film Inside Llewyn Davis, in which a ginger tom stole the limelight from Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan.

And when it comes to conflict, cats have proved themselves to be intrepid comrades.

Wing Commander Guy Gibson VC, who led the Dam Busters raid, took his his cat, Windy, with him on so many flights that it gained more flying hours than many human pilots.

Another wartime cat, Simon — an undernourished, dockyard kitten — was smuggled aboard HMS Amethyst in 1948 by 17-year-old Ordinary Seaman George Hickinbottom. Adored by the ship’s crew for his vigorous rat-catching and sense of humour (he used to leave dead rats in the sailors’ beds), he was given the rank of Able Seacat, and was wounded in action during the Yangtze Incident, when the ship was fired on by Chinese Communist gun batteries.

Simon was awarded the Dickin Medal in August 1949 and died of an infection later that year. The entire crew of HMS Amethyst attended his funeral at the Ilford Animal Cemetery.

Stories such as this bring tears to the eyes of soppy cat owners (of whom I am one).

But before we get too sentimental, Cryer’s richly enjoyable anthology reminds us of the saying by that prolific coiner of aphorisms, Anon: ‘A cat knows your every thought, but doesn’t care.’
