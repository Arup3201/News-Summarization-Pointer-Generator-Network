A 28-year-old medical school student who had planned to auctioning off her virginity on the internet and had received a high bid of $801,000 now says she won't go ahead with her part of the bargain.

In a blog post today, the student, who goes buy the name 'Elizabeth Raine,' writes that she won't fulfill the terms of the auction as she wants to focus on her medical studies instead.

'With the blessings of my management and the high bidders, I have decided to put a stop to this kerfuffle (to describe it nicely) and return my focus to my medical training,' Raine wrote, according to Gawker. 'I still do possess some spitefully strong beliefs about virginity, prostitution, and a woman's right to do as she damned pleases, but school is my first priority (as it has been for my entire life).

'At this point, I no longer care about the auction, at all. This was a very easy decision.'

While
 Raine initially said she was selling her virginity for the money, in 
recent days, her tone had changed and become more political.

'It
 is no longer about the money,' she wrote recently. 'Instead, very 
broadly, it is about how society continues to exercise control over 
female sexuality by chaining it tightly to female morality.

'It
 is about the fact that we have not left patriarchy in the past (we all 
know male morality is not judged by the same standard), and that a woman
 still cannot chose to do with her body what she pleases without 
eliciting condemnation and hate from those (or some of those) around 
her.'

Raine
 launched her online auction on March 31 and initially hid her face to 
conceal her identity before later deciding it would help convince 
skeptical customers.

Initially, she said she wanted to do the auction as she is also attracted by the adventure, eroticism, scandal and the chance to challenge norms about virginity.

At the time, she added that she's been planning the auction for a year and it's transformed her, making her more educated about prostitution, virginity and 'slut-shaming.'

Raine told the Huffington Post she was born in the southwest but spent much of her childhood in Saudi Arabia because of her dad's job in the oil industry.

He mom died when she was 10, which was tragic but the trauma is not the reason she is choosing this path to riches.

She told news website that she's still a virgin because sex and relationships came second to school work and other commitments.

Cold feet: Kern pulled out of her online auction on Wednesday, saying she wanted to focus on her studies

'I have a busy life. I am picky and guys were never a priority,' she said.

Raine claims to have bachelor's degrees in both biology and engineering and is currently completing a combined MD/PhD program, but was concerned her 'business venture' might get her thrown out of college if officials learned she's the 'Med School Virgin.'

'Lawyers have different opinions on whether I'd get kicked out, but one lawyer I trust believes it won't happen,' she said.

If she had gone through with the deal, the sex would have taken place in Australia because prostitution is illegal in the U.S.
