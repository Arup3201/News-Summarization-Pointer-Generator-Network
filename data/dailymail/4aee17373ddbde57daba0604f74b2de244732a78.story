Martin Thompson, 29, had been the Haskins' gardener for about five years, and had earned their trust

A conman has been jailed for fleecing an elderly couple out of their £50,000 life savings - by posing as their grandson.

Gardener Martin Thompson, 29, left Bertie and Marion Haskins penniless after plundering cash from three of their bank accounts, Bristol Crown Court heard.

After befriending the pair he persuaded them to let him sign their cheques - telling the banks he was their grandson - and spent their life savings on a string of holidays.

Devastated Marion was admitted to hospital with stress over the scam and contracted a superbug which killed her on May 7 this year.

The court heard that her blind husband, who suffers from severe arthritis, now finds it hard to trust anyone.

Jailing Thompson for three and a half years, Judge Michael Longman condemned his 'greed and wicked behaviour'.

He said: 'Over a period of time, you unscrupulously fleeced them of their savings for your own personal enrichment.'

Thompson, from Longwell Green, near Bristol, admitted three counts of theft between May 23, 2009, and January 31 this year.

The court heard he had taken £23,400 from the couple's Britannia account, £18,851.40 from their Post Office account and £6,250 from their Santander account.

John Penny, prosecuting, said Thompson had been a gardener for the couple at their maisonette in Cadbury Heath, Bristol, for about five years.

He built up so much trust that he persuaded Mrs Haskins to make him a signatory on the couple's Post Office bank account.

This gave him access to their pensions and the account from which bills and rent came out by direct debit.

He regularly withdrew money for them from that account and, unbeknown to the couple, he become a joint account holder for other accounts with Santander and Britannia.

By posing as their grandson, he began making withdrawals for himself - gradually depleting their life savings.

The 29-year-old was sentenced to three and a half years in jail at Bristol Crown Court

Eventually their direct debits, which for years had been paid on time and without a hitch, started being rejected by the banks.

Suspicions were raised by a neighbour of the couple, who noticed an overdue utility bill.

She spoke to their niece Bridget Lyons, who contacted Thompson and later called the police.

When he was arrested in February this year, Thompson maintained he had been given permission to withdraw money for Mr and Mrs Haskins.

But when police interviewed the couple it emerged they had no idea he had been taking so much money from the account and had become a joint account holder.

Speaking after Thompson was sentenced, Detective Constable Pete Walker, of Avon and Somerset Police, said that the Haskins had lived in the same home for 50 years and were considered 'perfect tenants' before the fraud.

He said: 'This is a despicable crime in which Martin Thompson took advantage of a vulnerable couple - and their age - having gained their trust over a number of years.'

As the money stolen was as a result of 'legitimate' withdrawals, the banks have not paid the Haskins back any of the money.

A Proceeds of Crime Act application has been lodged in a bid to recoup some of the money from Thompson.
