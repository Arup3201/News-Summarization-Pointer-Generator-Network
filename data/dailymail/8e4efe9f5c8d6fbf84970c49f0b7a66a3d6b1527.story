They say honesty is the best policy.

But Debra Delane Asher may be regretting this declaration.

For when she was arrested and charged with selling crystal meth, this is what she was wearing.

Not ideal mugshot attire: Debra Delane Asher, 37, was wearing this t-shirt when she was arrested and charged with dealing crystal meth in London, Kentucky, on Tuesday as part of a three-month undercover sting

Sulking into the camera, her sullen expression is teamed with the slogan: 'I [heart] CRYSTAL METH'.

The 37-year-old was detained in London, Kentucky, on Tuesday with an alleged accomplice Richard Jeffrey Rice, 57, shortly after midnight.

Police seized 3.37 grams of the drug along with cash and a set of digital scales, Laurel County Sheriff's Department claims. 

The arrest was part of a widespread sting by Detective Jason Black and a team of officers.

Alleged accomplice: Asher was arrested alongside Richard Jeffrey Rice, 57, with 3.37g of the drug, police say

After a three-month undercover investigation, titled Operation Remember November, the squad issued warrants for the arrest of 39 people suspected of drug trafficking.

On November 1, 24 of the 39 were arrested.

A further seven have now been detained, including Asher and Rice.
