Pippa Middleton was pretty in pink and purple as she attended a wedding in Italy earlier today.

It was a family affair as the Duchess Of Cambridge's sister and her boyfriend Nico Jackson were joined by Kate's brother-in-law Prince Harry, 30, for the nuptials of their close friends Charlie Gilkes and Anneke von Trotha Taylor.

The trio weren't the only VIP guests at the ceremony, which took place at the Carlo V Castle on the seafront in Monopoli.

Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Michael and James Middleton and Donna Air were also among the high-profile guests who had been invited to the Mediterranean bash to enjoy the last of the summer sunshine.

It had been rumoured that Kate was due to attend as the newlyweds are part of the couple’s ‘inner sanctum’. 

But the Duchess Of Cambridge's bout of severe morning sickness had forced her to stay at home.

Prince William was also noticeably absent due to his royal commitments that involved a tour of Malta this weekend.

There was nonetheless a large royal contingent to watch restaurant and nightclub owner Charlie Gilkes and PR worker Anneke von Trotha Taylor tie the knot. 

The groom is long-term friends with the princes after schooling together at Eton. 

He has also been close to Pippa, 31, for several years  and the pair were even romantically linked in 2010, when they went on a series of dates together. 

Prince Harry would have been keen to relax at his friend's wedding after the success of the Invictus Games

Despite rumours that Prince Harry had rekindled his romance with Cressida Bonas back in London this week he seemed to be on his own at this wedding. 

Princess Beatrice knows the couple well after she started working for Charlie's brother Alexander in New York. 

Although a foreign wedding is a costly affair to attend, Harry, Beatrice, 26, and Eugenie, 24, were spotted taking an Easyjet flight from London to Puglia earlier today, perhaps saving some pennies on their weekend away. 

Pippa and Nico mingled with fellow guests while waiting to enter the ceremony at the the Carlo V Castle in Monopoli
