Teachers should not ignore children who remain silent or deny abuse, the Children's Commissioner has warned (library image)

Child abuse victims ‘all too easily become invisible’ because teachers and social workers expect youngsters to tell them if they are having problems, the Children’s Commissioner is warning.

Adults in schools and other professional settings have a ‘duty to protect’ children – but too often they take a child’s silence or denials as ‘a reason for doing nothing further’, Maggie Atkinson said.

Young people often fail to seek help because they assume what is happening to them is normal, blame themselves for it or fear the consequences of speaking out, according to research commissioned by Dr Atkinson.

Common sense recommendations in a report accompanying the research include adults ‘not relying unduly on children telling them verbally before providing help’. The report, published today, follows a string of tragic cases where children have died after suffering appalling abuse at home.

They include Daniel Pelka, four, who was tortured to death by his mother and her partner when teachers, medics, social workers and welfare officers failed to ‘think the unthinkable’.

Despite numerous referrals to children’s services at Coventry City Council, social workers concluded on four occasions that he was not at risk.

In another recent case, Keanu Williams died after months of abuse by his mother. The two-year-old, who was found with 37 injuries, had been to A&E and his GP at least 12 times and nursery staff were made aware of signs of neglect and abuse.

But agencies in Birmingham believed his mother’s claims that he had simply picked up bumps and bruises.

A serious case review found they had been ‘unwilling to challenge’ or show ‘professional curiosity’. 

Dr Atkinson, a government-appointed adviser whose role is to champion the interests of young people, said: ‘Sadly, far too many children continue to suffer physical and emotional abuse and neglect at the hands of adults and far too many professionals with whom they come into contact, who have a duty to protect them, fail to do so.

'Children often don’t understand they
 are being abused. If they are old enough to do so, it takes incredible 
courage for them to overcome the barriers to talk to someone about it.

‘So
 those with responsibility for protecting them must take heed of the 
practical advice and recommendations in this report and improve the way 
they identify and work with children who may be being abused.’ Dr 
Atkinson added: ‘Children all too easily become invisible.

‘If children do not talk about abuse, their silence is not a reason to do nothing further. The onus cannot be on them to come forward.’

Researchers found the most common way 
that abused children came to the attention of their school or social 
workers was through their behaviour and attitude, rather than seeking 
help.

Daniel Pelka, aged four, died severely malnourished after being starved in the months leading up to his death by his mother and stepfather

The report said: ‘It is important for professionals to notice signs and symptoms of children and young people’s distress at any age and not to rely unduly upon the child or young person to talk about their abuse.

‘A significant risk of reliance on verbal telling is that a child’s silence or denial means that abuse is not pursued.’

In the report, adults are advised to ‘be curious and concerned about young people who appear to be struggling’ and ‘be aware of the reasons why children and young people might avoid telling or deny that there is a difficulty’.
