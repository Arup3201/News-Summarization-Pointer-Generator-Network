Cleared: Deputy assaulting a seven-year-old boy

A deputy headmaster with an unblemished 40-year career was dragged through the courts after an ‘uncontrollable’ seven-year-old boy accused him of assault.

Royden Cope was ‘marched out’ of his Church of England primary school and endured a five-month legal nightmare before he was eventually cleared by magistrates.

The chairman of the bench, Graham Parr, declared there were ‘real doubts’ about the case.

Afterwards, Mr Cope’s daughter Joy Corrigan, 33, who is also a teacher, said: ‘The saddest thing is that my dad was nearing retirement and after such a long career one of his resounding memories will be being marched off the premises. It should not have ended like this.’

Mrs Corrigan, whose eight-year-old daughter was in her father’s class at the school, St Bartholomew’s in Great Harwood, Lancashire, added: ‘We have had to move her out of the school. Every day she would get asked questions about where my dad was, and she was getting distressed.

‘She was also being goaded by this young boy who seemed impressed about what he had done.’

Mr Cope, 63, whose record was ‘impeccable’ as deputy head for 34 years, was accused of restraining the boy by his wrists and then slapping him across the face. But he said the boy had slammed his head into his hand during an hysterical outburst.

He could have been jailed for up to six months if found guilty.

The incident happened on March 9 when the youngster ran amok, hitting ten classmates with his bag, pinning one of them to the wall, and yelling at teachers.

Mr Cope was called out of a rehearsal for a forthcoming school production of Wind In The Willows to deal with him.

One teacher said the boy was in such a temper his face was bright red, and he grabbed railings to stop himself being taken to Mr Cope’s classroom, repeatedly screaming: ‘Get off me, get off me’, the court heard.

Mr Cope, wearing a grey pinstripe suit, told Blackburn magistrates: ‘He had worked himself into an incandescent rage, but I thought I would eventually calm him down and just needed to be firm with him. He was next to a cupboard and a desk leg, and I held him by the hands as I was concerned he would bang his head.

‘I was trying to stop his head from rolling around so I put my hand out to stop him. That’s when he slammed into my hand and there was contact.’

He added: ‘I am a teacher with over 40 years’ experience and with a good reputation within the school and local community. This allegation has caused me and my family great distress.’

However another teacher, Thomas Lowe, claimed he did see Mr Cope striking the child and recalled him saying: ‘Do you want another? I can hit you again.’

Mr Lowe told the court that when Mr Cope took the boy into his classroom, he had followed as he felt he should ‘support’ his colleague who had recently suffered a heart attack.

He said: ‘Mr Cope released or lost control of the boy’s left arm and then he struck him across the face.’

However this version of events was rejected by the magistrates. After the verdict, Mr Cope’s wife Carole, 63, a retired reception class teacher, said the family wanted to rebuild their lives.

A parent at the 236-pupil school, Wendy Litherland, described Mr Cope as ‘an absolutely outstanding teacher’ and said: ‘He has dedicated his life to the school and all the parents are 100 per cent behind him.

‘This boy is still at the school wandering around the playground, attacking other children. It is just disgraceful.’

In his statement to police, Mr Cope said the boy – who cannot be named for legal reasons – was the most ‘disruptive and aggressive’ he had ever encountered and had been removed from class in his first year for hitting other children.

Mr Cope told the court that on the day of the incident, the boy was ‘kicking off’ and being ‘very belligerent’.

He said: ‘On some occasions he is uncontrollable. I would say that as he has got older, he has become more aware of his own physical prowess and he has become more aggressive.’

The boy told his mother that he had been hit by Mr Cope three days after the alleged incident. She said he had described ‘a struggle’ and said Mr Cope had grabbed his wrists before he ‘slapped him’.

Last night Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There are times when teachers do have to use physical restraint, even with young children, to prevent them hurting themselves or others, and it is perfectly within the law.’

Lancashire county council said Mr Cope remained suspended pending an internal inquiry.
