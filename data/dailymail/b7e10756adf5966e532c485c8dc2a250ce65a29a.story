Concerned: Nathaniel Lees's father Martin, a businessman in Abu Dhabi

A young British man who could face a firing squad after being caught selling less than an ounce of cannabis has been revealed to be the son of a businessman.

Nathaniel Lees, 23,  was sentenced to death alongside his 19-year-old Syrian accomplice in a court in the strict Muslim emirate of Abu Dhabi.

He is the son of British businessman Martin Lees, who is the director of GTS Training Solutions, a 
British company registered in the Isle of Man and based in Abu Dhabi.

It is unclear whether Nathaniel Lees was caught selling the marijuana with a street value of £262 to a detective posing as a customer or a Syrian man. 

The company provides staff training to oil and gas companies.

Known as 
Nathan, Lees is currently in Abu Dhabi Central Prison, about an hour from the city 
centre according to The Daily Telegraph.

His identity had been kept secret under local laws.

Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates.

Despite being a multicultural city it adheres to the strict Muslim laws of the country.

The last execution to be carried out 
in the UAE was in February last year, when a man convicted of the rape 
and murder of a child was sentenced to death by firing squad.

The judge in his case claimed that Lees was an experienced drug dealer who 
was also selling opium and heroin, but it appears that no evidence of this appears 
to have been produced in court.

After the verdict in Abu Dhabi’s Criminal Court earlier this month Lees's mother Abeba Gebebramlak, who is of Eritrean origin, collapsed outside court.

Born in Jeddah, where his father worked for the Saudi Yanbu 
Petrochemical Company, Lees has lived most of his life in the United Arab
Emirates.

While Lees's case file describes him as an 'electrician', he seems to 
have had no regular job and no education beyond secondary school.

Asked on the social networking website MySpace whether he wanted to go 
to college, he replied: 'LOL [laugh out loud]. Just ask if I want to 
goto [sic] a 4 year party instead.'

Lees' cases file shows he has previously had contact with the local police and showed a prior charge of possessing drugs.

The newspaper reported that on his MySpace profile he wrote: 'In the past month, 
have you been on drugs?" he asks himself.

'If I had access to drugs, 
would I be on MySpace?' is his reply.

Verdict: The young British national was sentenced to death by firing squad at Abu Dhabi Criminal Court

When he was questioned on his first thoughts when waking 
up, Lees wrote: 'F---, where did I put my pipe.'

A Sudanese man, who was also a defendant, was sentenced to one year in jail and deportation for taking the drug, while a 17-year-old Emirati was sent for rehabilitation.

Previously in court, defence lawyers had attacked the credibility of the police investigations, because the witness said he did not know the address of the defendants.

He also said that the Syrian asked the Briton to get him the drugs from the car in Arabic, which lawyers said did not make sense.

The last execution to be carried out in 
the UAE was in February last year, when a man convicted of the rape and 
murder of a child was sentenced to death by firing squad.

In the UAE, executions are always 
carried out by firing squad made up of eight gunmen so the executioners 
remain ignorant of who fired the fateful shot.

An Foreign & Commonwealth Office spokesperson said:

'We can confirm that a British national is facing the death penalty in the United Arab Emirates.

'We will remain in close contact with the individual, their family and legal representative and continue to provide them with the appropriate consular assistance.'

The conservative UAE has made news recently with crackdowns on tourists and foreign workers

The conservative UAE has a history of cracking down on the many foreigners who live there for indecent or 'un-Islamic' behaviour.

Earlier this year, a British landscape architect has been fined after he asked colleagues in a meeting: 'When will we finish with the damn mosques?'

John Hall, 42, the former Millennium Dome site planner, works for the parks and recreation section of Abu Dhabi Municipality, and was appealing against a one-month prison sentence imposed by the Court of Misdemeanours.

Mr Hall’s lawyer persuaded the judge that the word damn could mean ‘strong criticism in an unofficial way’ and he was fined £840 instead.

In 2010, a British woman who made a rape complaint in Dubai was arrested for having illegal sex with her fiance.

The woman, a 23-year-old from London, said she was raped by a waiter in a luxury hotel after celebrating her engagement to her 44-year-old boyfriend, also from London.

But when she reported the alleged rape to police in the Middle Eastern state she and her boyfriend were arrested for having sex outside marriage and illegal drinking outside licensed premises.

Later that year, another British woman was arrested for wearing a bikini at a Dubai mall.

The woman, a holidaymaker, was charged with indecency in Dubai after walking through the world's largest shopping centre in a bikini.

The woman was buying clothes and gifts in the Dubai Mall, fully dressed but in a low-cut top, when she was accosted by an Arabic woman and criticised for wearing 'revealing clothing'.

The mall's security team then intervened and called the police, who arrested the British holidaymaker.
