Turf was exchanged for surf as polo players battled it out on the Cornish coastline during the Veuve Cliquot Polo on the Beach  tournament.

Now
 in its eighth year, the annual tournament takes place on Cornwall's most popular surfing beaches at Watergate Bay and is one of only a handful of polo matches to be played on sand.

Organisers say the aim of the event is to bring the game to a wider audience and blend its glamour with the raw beauty of Cornwall.

Spectators sipped champagne and listened to DJ sets from duo Billon as the game was played.

A modern twist on the equestrian sport traditionally played on grass, the rules of beach polo are slightly different, with adaptations largely due to the smaller size of the ground.

The full game is played over four chukkas. The first three chukkas are seven-and-a-half minutes long and the last chukka is played for seven minutes, unless there is a draw in which case a knock out chukka is played.  The clock does not stop when the ball goes out of play - in beach polo the clock is only stopped when a foul has been committed.

Despite the change of terrain, spectators still pitched in at half time to help replace the 'divots' - usually left by horse hooves in grass
