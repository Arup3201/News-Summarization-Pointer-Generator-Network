An independent Scotland would be defended by a part-time air force, military analysts said yesterday.

They suggested that the limited defence spending that would follow independence means the new country would be forced to run an air force that could operate only in office hours.

Edward Hunt, defence consultant at IHS Jane’s, said a Scottish air force is likely to run on similar lines to those of Switzerland or Austria.

The Swiss air force has aircraft ready to fly during office hours on weekdays only, because spending limits and shortage of pilots and personnel means it cannot fly around the clock.

Austria has 12 modern Typhoon fighters – the same number Scotland would claim from the rest of the UK after a Yes vote – and operates them between 8am and 4pm.

Lack of air defence capacity in Scotland would force RAF aircraft to intervene in the event of an out-of-hours emergency, for example the arrival in Scottish airspace of a hijacked airliner.

The Scottish government has said it plans to spend £2.5billion a year on defence. It would claim two frigates and four minehunters from the Royal Navy, together with the Typhoons to be handed over by the RAF. After a decade of independence, it plans to have a standing army of 15,000.

Mr Hunt said: ‘There is a danger of a limited Scottish defence budget resulting in what can be considered a very hollow force.

‘Such limitations on military capabilities are precisely why the US is likely to view independence as further fragmentation of European defence capabilities.’
