Chocoholics will soon be able to take their passion to new heights as the world's first chocolate hotel opens in Bournemouth.

The Chocolate Boutique Hotel claims to have all the ingredients to give its guests sweet dreams thanks to 13 cocoa-themed rooms, chocolate cookery classes and a bar serving up chocolate cocktails.

As the only chocolate themed hotel in the world, the family-run business bills itself as the perfect venue for hen nights and girlie get-togethers.

Sweet dreams: The Chocolate Boutique Hotel in Bournemouth is choctastic and even offers chocolate making workshops

And in an attempt to prove sleepovers are not just for children, the Chocolate Boutique Hotel has launched a grown-up chocolate slumber party where groups can have a midnight feast.

Chocolatier Gerry Wilson, the brains behind the hotel, said: 'It's the perfect girls' night in.'

Guests arrive at the hotel before they are taken into the kitchen to test the goods and take part in a chocolate workshop.

While there, they paint their own portrait using dark, milk and white chocolate.

Raise a glass: There is an extensive list of chocolate cocktails such as a Chocolate Martini and Chocmeister

Midnight feats: Each room (chocolate themed, of course) is kitted out 
with a chocolate fountain and midnight feats are also on offer if guests
need a sweet fix in the night

The afternoon goes on to offer a cocktail-making session at the chocolate bar where guests can indulge in three chocolatey drinks such as the Chocolate Martini and Chocmeister, as well as an extensive wine list.

They can then retire to their rooms before dinner, where a chocolate fountain is installed at the bottom of every bed.

'There's a chocolate everything on the menu,' Gerry said.

'What more would anyone want. It's a lot of fun.'

After a tipple of two, you can don your pyjamas and nestle down in the chocolatey-themed rooms, such as the Cocoa Bean or the Aztec.

Chocolatiers: Gerry and his team are often called on by celebrities to provide chocolate functions for film premieres and weddings

And if you fancy a midnight feast, Gerry and his team will raid the kitchen for you and tiptoe up the stairs with yet more chocolate to get you through the night.

Gerry and his team are often called on by celebrities to provide chocolate functions for film premieres and weddings, including installing a chocolate fountain for Peter Andre and Katie Price's wedding.

By the seaside: The Chocolate Boutique Hotel is based in the coastal area of Bournemouth
