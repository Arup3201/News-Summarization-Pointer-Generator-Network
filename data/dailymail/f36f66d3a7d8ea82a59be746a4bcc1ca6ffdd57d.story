A boat carrying illegal immigrants to England from France sank in the English channel this morning.

There were 10 people on board including two British citizens who it is believed were smuggling the other eight into the country.

French rescue teams were first on the scene shortly after 6.30am followed shortly after by the UK Coastguard.

One person was airlifted by an RAF helicopter to Calais suffering from suspected hypothermia.

Two boats are believed to have left the French coast when one of them started sinking.

The stowaways and two suspected ‘smugglers’ jumped onto another inflatable boat, according to French authorities.

Frank O’Neill, watch manager for Dover Coastguard, said: 'There were two boats, one of which had sunk.

'We are searching the sea to see if anything sinister is attached to this.

'We have recovered one boat with 10 people on board - two smugglers and eight stowaways.'

Andy Roberts, launch officer for Dover Lifeboat, said the 'British guys were driving the rig'.

Mr O’Neill said that one of the stowaways was ‘very badly hypothermic’ and had been taken to hospital.

The incident occurred around 11 miles from Dover and 9 miles from Calais.

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesman said: ‘The UK Coastguard have assisted their French colleagues in a search and rescue mission in the French area of responsibility in the Dover Strait.

‘Two RHIBs [dingies] were attempting to cross to the UK from France with ten people aboard when one vessel sank.

‘Those in the water were recovered by the other RHIB. We tasked a lifeboat and helicopter at the request of the French Search and Rescue authorities at Cross Gris Nez.

‘The helicopter winched one person and took them to hospital in France. The lifeboat conducted a search to ensure that there was no one else in danger.'
