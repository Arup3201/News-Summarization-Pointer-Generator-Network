An abused dog was left tied to a rock next to rising creek water, it has emerged.

The dog was spotted clinging to life next to the creek in north east Pennsylvania on Saturday.

Passer-by Wyatt Erb spotted the Labrador mix as he walked with his wife. He immediately jumped into the Newshaminy Creek, in Bristol Township, and saved the dog.

He told NBC News: 'The leash was actually hooked to a stone in the ground. It’s not something the dog could have done by itself.'

Police officers have said his actions saved the dog's life.

Sergeant Thomas Gaffney of the Bristol Police Department said: 'She would have drowned more than likely if the water got high enough.'

Detectives say the dog suffered from years of abuse and also had a tumour on one of her legs which was never treated.
