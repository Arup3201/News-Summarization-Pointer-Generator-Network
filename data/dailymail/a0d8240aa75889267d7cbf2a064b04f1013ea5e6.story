Given Liverpool's influx of new signings this summer, it's been easy to forget that one of the big-name arrivals is still set to make his debut.

But having joined in a £25million switch from Southampton, Adam Lallana looks closer than ever to a first Reds appearance after wearing the club shirt for the first time in a training game.

The England midfielder was fully kitted out in the Liverpool home strip as a team featuring Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini, Lucas and Jose Enrique took on Wolves in a closed doors friendly, with the former Saints star finding the back of the net in a 1-0 win.

While many of Brendan Rodgers' team are on international duty, his remaining stars are still being put through their paces at the club's Melwood training ground.

Lallana's delayed Liverpool debut  has come as a result of a post-World Cup knee injury but he looked in good shape as Wolves put the Reds star through his paces.

The 26-year-old was in line to feature in the 3-0 win against Tottenham last Sunday, but now looks on course to make his bow at Anfield against Aston Villa on September 13.
