Sunderland finally cut ties with manager Gus Poyet on Monday after a 4-0 home defeat by fellow strugglers Aston Villa left the Wearside club just one point above the relegation zone in the Barclays Premier League.

With that in mind, Sportsmail have Sunderland fan Joe Cooper of 90min.com to tell us what he makes of the situation. Is Dick Advocaat a suitable short-term replacement for Poyet? Let's see what he had to say.

Gus Poyet's sacking as manager of Sunderland couldn't have come soon enough.

Chairman Ellis Short took the decision on Monday and it's hard to argue that it wasn't the right call. The relationship just wasn't working, our supporters know it and they didn't hesitate to show the Uruguayan their dissatisfaction on a grim afternoon on Wearside on Saturday.

There's a better fit out there. And while we've been clamouring for a change at the helm over the course of the last few months, it's become glaringly obvious that Poyet himself didn't want to remain in charge either.

Additionally, Poyet's moniker of 'head coach' meant he was not in primary charge of signing players. He'd made it obvious that it wasn't something he was comfortable with. An unhealthy relationship at the top rolls downwards, as with any business. Poyet's attitude had transcended onto the pitch and it has been having a terrible effect. Saturday was the cast-iron evidence of that.

We are just a point above the Barclays Premier League's relegation zone following the home 4-0 drubbing to Aston Villa. Bear in mind that this was a team with the league's worst attack and they'd put four past us before half-time. Poyet's position had become untenable.

Advocaat has never managed in England before but is reportedly in line for a £500,000 survival bonus

The decision to remove Poyet doesn't reek of desperation, given  Advocaat's appointment within 24 hours

Our situation looks precarious, but it's worth remembering that it could be far worse. It's the right time for Poyet to leave. Something needed to be done before it was too late. Luckily, we've not quite reached that stage yet - there's nine games to save ourselves.

We've moved swiftly in hiring a replacement, which is always promising. The decision to remove Poyet doesn't exactly reek of desperation, given former Rangers and Dutch national coach Dick Advocaat was brought in within 24 hours.

Advocaat has been handed the job on a short-term basis. As well as the wealth of managerial experience he brings, the reported £500,000 he'll pocket to avoid relegation is enough of a motivation. He's no spring chicken at 67, but Advocaat has spoken of his own hunger to prove himself in the Premier League. He's got the knowledge under his belt to do that.

There's enough reason for the fans to be confident that we can stay up. New managers inevitably inject a shot in the arm to their players in their first few weeks. It should be enough to carry us through to the end. You only have to look at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion to see the impact that both new managers have had on the teams' fortunes.

Sam Allardyce has been touted as a potential replacement after an impressive season with West Ham

Steve McClaren looks Premier League-bound either with Derby County or one of many interested clubs

Our long-term aspirations may be higher than merely fighting relegation, but it's now a case of seeing this season out before starting afresh again next term. It likely won't be Advocaat to take us beyond this summer, but with the likes of Sam Allardyce and Steve McClaren - who have both had promising seasons at their respective clubs - linked as Poyet's long-term successor, things are looking up.

Poyet had reached the point of no return, so it's time to start afresh. Again.
