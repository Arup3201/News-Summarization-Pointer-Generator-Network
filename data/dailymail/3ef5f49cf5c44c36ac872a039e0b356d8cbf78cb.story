Liverpool ladies retained their Women's Super League title in dramatic fashion on Sunday, jumping from third in the table before the final round of fixtures to finish in top spot on goal difference.

The Reds knew they had to beat Bristol Academy to stand any chance of keeping hold of their trophy and they did just that with a comfortable 3-0 win at the Select Security stadium in Widnes.

Goals from Natasha Dowie, Lucy Bronze and Fara Williams ensured Matt Beard's side drew level with Chelsea, who lost 2-1 to Manchester City,  on 26 points but won the title by two goals.

Speaking after the game, Beard told BBC Sport: 'I'm over the moon. The players deserve so much credit. They have dug deep.

'Our second-half performance, we dominated to get three goals. The other scores put pressure on us.'

Chelsea only needed a point to stay top of the table but they couldn't manage it as goals from former Everton duo Jill Scott and Toni Duggan gave City victory at the Manchester Regional Arena.

Gilly Flaherty pulled one back for the Blues but they couldn't take advantage of Abbie McManus' sending off for an elbow on Yuki Ogimi, despite piling on the pressure late on. 

Birmingham City also started the day with a chance of winning the title but they were held to a 2-2 draw by Notts County in Solihull.

Goals from Kirsty Linnett and Hannah Keryskoplis twice brought the hosts level but they were unable to score a winner which would have seen them crowned champions.
