A macabre directory listing the name, rank and decorations of every SS member is going up for auction decades after it was stolen from Nazi officials by a British spy.

The 425-page book contains more than 30,000 entries, detailing every fighter in the Nazi Party's paramilitary arm - with feared leader Heinrich Himmler at the top of the list.

It was published on December 1, 1938, just months before the start of the Second World War, and was later stolen by a member of Britain's Special Operations Executive.

The directory is expected to fetch up to £2,000 when it goes under the hammer next month.

Stolen: The book was taken from Nazi headquarters by a British officers from the Special Operations Executive

The book is set out like a telephone directory, listing the name of each SS member, their decorations and awards, their division, party number, SS number, date of birth and promotion details.

It also contains entries for officers who had died before the book was published, in a tribute to their contribution to the Nazis' twisted cause.

The head, or 'Reichsführer', of the SS was Himmler, widely regarded as the architect of the 'Final Solution' which led to the murder of 11million people in concentration camps.

Other leading Nazis listed in the directory include Adolf Eichmann, number 6448, who was personably reponsible for the murder of 3million Jews.

In 1960, Eichmann was caught in Argentina by Israeli secret service agents and brought back to Israel to be put on trial where he was found guilty and hanged.

Reinhard Heydrich, described by Hitler as 'the man with the iron heart', is number 28 in the book, while Auschwitz boss Rudolf Hoess is listed at number 19,202.

Many of the most notorious leaders of the Third Reich occupied relatively low positions in the SS hierarchy at the time the directory was published, as they did not achieve their senior positions until later.

Hitler does not appear in the book, because he was never a member of the SS despite being leader of the Nazi Party.

The directory was taken by an unnamed British spy who was tasked with infiltrating the German high command.

He smuggled it back to Britain to be 
examined by the intelligence services, and then kept it as a keepsake - 
which was only discovered by his family when they were sorting through 
his belongings after his death a few years ago.

Richard Westwood-Brookes, from Mullock's Auctions in Shropshire, said: 'This book is extremely rare and the story of how it was stolen from under the noses of the Germans is also highly intriguing.

'If you are a researcher of the Third Reich, which many people are, it is worth its weight in gold. It really wouldn't take much for a researcher to trace the people in the book, it could show the missing pieces to someone's puzzle.

'Former members of the SS would have wanted to conceal their identities, but this book will show them for what they once were - this sort of information is priceless in my opinion.

'Most of the men in this book were monsters, people such as Himmler, a man very close to Adolf Hitler, they put people through hell.'

The directory will go up for auction on March 18 at Ludlow Racecourse, with an estimate of between £1,000 and £2,000.

Founded in 1925, the 'Schutzstaffel', 
German for 'protection squad', initially served as Adolf Hitler's personal bodyguards, later becoming one of the most 
powerful and feared organisations in all of Nazi Germany.

Heinrich Himmler, a militant anti-Semite who was later architect of the 'Final Solution', became head of the SS in 1929 and expanded the group's role and size.

Recruits
 had to prove their 'racial purity' and were also taught they were the 
not only the elite of Nazi Party but also of all humankind.

By
 the start of the Second World War the SS had more than 250,000 members 
and multiple subdivisions, engaged in activities ranging from 
intelligence operations to running Nazi concentration camps.

The
 soldiers of the SS committed many atrocities during the war, while the 
concentration camp system was set up in the 1930s by Theodor Eicke of 
the SS.

Thousands of SS men 
were also drafted to help exterminate the Jews of Eastern Europe, 
participating in mass killings or guarding ghetto districts where Jews 
from the west were concentrated before being sent to death camps.

At
 the end of the war many leading members of the SS - including Himmler -
 committed suicide. Those that were captured were tried at the Nuremburg
 war crimes trials.
