The world now has more billionaires than ever before.

New numbers from the China-based Hurun Report reveal a net gain of 222 billionaires in 2014, putting the total at a record 2,089.

While the United States still takes the trophy for the most billionaires ahead of China, India made its first showing in 2014 in the top three countries with the most members of the world's most exclusive club.

India pushed out Russia by adding 27 members to the club, bring its total number of billionaires to 97. China gained 72 to bring its total to 430 and the U.S. added 56 and now has 537, according to CNBC.

Most billionaires ever: The world created 341 new billionaires in 2014, helping to bump the total to a record 2,089. The world's richest man remains Bill Gates (worth $85B) and his home country of the United States has the most billionaires, with 537

Despite the worldwide net gain, not every billionaire had a good year. Some even lost the status. Last year saw a gain of 341 new billionaires, 95 became mere multi-millionaires. 

Perhaps hit the hardest were the billionaires in some of the developing world, most notably Russia.

According to the Hurun Report, 'Wealth of 60 percent of Russian billionaires declined in the face of the stagnating economy, devalued ruble and plummeting global oil prices.'

The most new billionaires were born of the tech sector in 2014, according to Hurun Report.

'Tech has been leading the way again for new billionaires,' Hurun chairman Rupert Hoogewerf said. 'It's all eyes on the new economy.'

That's true not least of all for one of the original tech billionaires, and the richest man in the work, Bill Gates. The Microsoft mogul saw his fortune increase by 25 percent last year to $85 billion.

Meanwhile, world's second wealthiest man Mexico's Carlos Slim saw his worth bumped up to $83 billion. In at number three was Warren Buffett, whose $76 billion fortune increased 19 percent from the previous year.

Warren Buffett's $76B helped him come into the number 3 spot behind Carlos Slim of Mexico. While the three richest come from North America, burgeoning players China and India rounded off the top three countries with the most billionaires behind the U.S.
