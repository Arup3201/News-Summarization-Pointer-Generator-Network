This is the moment an angry motorist appeared to attempt to mow down a cyclist after speeding towards him in reverse.

Cyclist Thomas Bardon, 23, of Harrogate, North Yorkshire, ducked into a nearby driveway to avoid the red Peugeot as it reversed towards him down the country lane.

Mr Bardon and the unnamed driver were involved in a verbal spat after the driver nearly collided with the cyclist as they travelled past a parked car.

Angry: The duo exchanged remarks after the driver pulled up to block the road, before both carried on their way

After angrily beeping a horn on his bike and swearing at the driver with his middle finger, he turned to carry on cycling.

But Mr Bardon realised the driver had stuck his car in reverse. He had been cycling home when the incident - which was caught on camera - occurred last month.

He said: ‘In the mirror I noticed a car coming towards me with speed. I was sure he was going to run me down so took refuge in an upcoming driveway I knew of.’

The duo exchanged remarks after the 
driver pulled up to block the road, with Mr Bardon telling the driver 
that he was going to give his camera footage to the police.

However, the driver replied by saying: ‘That's good - you go to the camera [sic], because then we'll see how much room I had, and how much room you had.’

The driver then drove away from the scene.

Mr Bardon 
added: ‘After he left I set off again keeping my eye on my mirror in 
case he did a U-turn and tried to come at me again.

'It was reported to 
the police but they took no interest.’

A North Yorkshire Police spokesman confirmed that they were not investigating the incident.
