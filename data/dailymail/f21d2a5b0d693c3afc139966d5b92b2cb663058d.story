Police officer Brendan Buggie, pictured, lost control of his car while drink-driving and killed his former girlfriend's best friend, who he was dating at the time, a court heard

A police officer lost control of his car while drink-driving and killed his new girlfriend, a court heard today.

Brendan
Buggie, 39, an officer with Greater Manchester Police, had just started
a relationship with Justyna Stanczak, his former girlfriend's best friend, when the incident occurred, a jury
has been told.

The court heard he skidded on an icy road in Ramsbottom, Lancashire, while twice the legal limit in the early hours of December 5 last year.

Bradford Crown Court heard that Buggie’s Toyota skidded into a stationary white van, killing 26-year-old Justyna, the best friend of his former girlfriend Lucy Fox.

Prosecutors said Miss Fox’s mother, taxi driver Elaine Singleton, had seen Buggie and Justyna holding hands that night and told her daughter.

That sparked a furious text exchange between the three, so Buggie had offered to drive his new girlfriend back to her home in Bury.

Nicholas Williams, prosecuting, told a jury of eight men and four women that Buggie had drunk six pints of beer at several different pubs in Ramsbottom on December 4, before meeting with Justyna, who worked in a wine bar.

He knew the young Polish national 'very well' through his ex-girlfriend who he had recently split with, but was keen to reconcile with, Mr Williams told the court.

He said that despite this, he and Justyna had begun a physical relationship, and that night had met for a drink before walking back to Buggie’s house - when they were spotted by Miss Fox’s mother.

Mr Williams said the text exchange between Miss Fox and the defendant had upset Justyna, and so Buggie offered to drive her the six miles back to her home in Bury.

Mr Williams said: 'He told police he had been hoping to get back together with his ex-girlfriend. She had ended the relationship and he was feeling really down at the time.

'By the time Justyna and the defendant got to his house it was after midnight and his dark blue Toyota was on the drive.

'He told police he had to de-ice the car as hail had frozen on the windscreen.

'The weather was "treacherous" as he called it.

'He said he had been slipping on ice on his walk back from the pub. He knew the road would be icy and was familiar with the road.'

Scene: Manchester Road in Ramsbottom where the accident happened in 'treacherous' conditions

Mr Williams told the court there was a 'thick sheet of ice' near the scene of the accident on the single-carriageway Manchester Road.

Another witness had been driving from Bury to Ramsbottom, and Mr Williams told the court he had described ice or frost 'glistening' on the surface of the road.

He had been driving at around 20-30mph.

Buggie told cops that at around 12.30am, he had been driving from Ramsbottom to Bury at the speed limit - 40mph, when he approached a left-hand bend in the road, and the back end of his car had skidded out.

He collided with a white van on the other side of the road, parked adjacent to a row of terraced houses.

The court heard Buggie called an ambulance straight away, and neighbours came out of their houses to see what had happened - with one telling cops how she could smell alcohol 'immediately'.

When the police arrived, and asked him how much he had had to drink, Buggie told them: 'enough'.

Justyna was unconscious straight away and despite regaining consciousness briefly, she died at around 4.30am at Fairfield General Hospital.

Mr Williams told the jury: 'In police interviews, the defendant said that despite having drunk six pints, he considered himself fine to drive.

'He said he knew the roads were slippery. In fact, he said he crawled along the minor road to the main road, but believed the main road would have been gritted.

'When asked what caused the accident, he said: "The vehicle slipping, I think it was the road conditions".

'But the prosecution say if he had been driving in such a way to take account of these conditions the accident would never have happened.

'The reality is if he had never been drinking he would never had lost control of the vehicle and Justyna would never have lost her life.

'His driving fell below the standard of a careful driver.'

Buggie denies the charge of causing death by careless driving while over the prescribed limit.

The trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
