Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's glamorous girlfriend Novella Benini kept a close eye on the progress of the team as they trained on Thursday ahead of their 'Rumble in the Jungle' clash with England.

Wearing shades and a baseball cap to keep out the strong Brazilian sun in Mangaratiba, Miss Benini watched on from the sidelines as her partner Prandelli took the session.

With two days left, the coach must make a decision over whether to play the in-form striker Ciro Immobile against England in their opening Group D clash at the Arena da Amazonia in Manaus.

Immobile, who scored 23 goals in 34 matches for Torino last season, proved he could adapt easily to the international stage when scoring a hat-trick and setting up two more goals in Italy's 5-3 win over Fluminense on Sunday.

That result was welcome after disappointing draws against the Republic of Ireland and Luxembourg suggested the Azzurri were far from ready to tackle a group containing England, Uruguay and Costa Rica.

Even though Italy have not yet made the four-hour flight up to Manaus, where temperatures are expected to top 30C during the England game, some of their players seemed to be struggling with the heat.

Mario Balotelli and Andrea Pirlo looked to be among those struggling as the sun beat down on their training at the Portobello Resort.

Despite pre-tournament expectations in Italy being quite low, Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has called for unity and a belief that they can advance to the latter stages of the tournament.

Ancelotti told the team to take inspiration from his Madrid side that won the Champions League last season.

'When you take part in a World Cup there is always a lot of excitement and tension and everyone needs to chip in if you want to achieve something big,' said Ancelotti in a letter published in La Gazzetta dello Sport.

'However, people are sceptical about our chances, and do not believe in us. Well, I can guarantee that if the team and the coaching staff stay united and all read from the same page, then the atmosphere will become more favourable, and results are more likely to go our way.

'That is how Real Madrid won the Champions League. That's why now it's important to encourage Italians to get behind our lads.'

The Italian admitted that Prandelli's side are far from being the tournament favourites, but also pointed out Italy were unfancied before the victorious World Cups of 1982 and 2006.

'We are in a difficult group,' admitted Ancelotti, 'but our opponents should be worried about our presence in it. One thing is for certain, facing Italy is difficult for every team. We are a strong team tactically, we are experienced and we have players that can make the difference.'
