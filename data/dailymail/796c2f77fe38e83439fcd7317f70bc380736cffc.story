Celebrity divorce lawyer Raymond Tooth has been fined after being caught ploughing his £50,000 Mercedes into a parked car and then speeding away from the scene.

The cigar-chomping solicitor, renowned for helping ex-wives land huge divorce settlements, was captured on CCTV crashing into the VW Polo – shunting it yards down the street – while trying to reverse in one of London’s most exclusive roads.

He owned up only after the footage, from a resident’s security camera, was handed to police who confronted him with the evidence.

Fined: Solicitor Raymond Tooth, nicknamed Jaws, with fellow celebrity lawyer Fiona Shackleton

The vehicle’s owner, 23-year-old Tom Gayner, said: 'It seems so unfair that the punishment for a hit and run accident like this, even though nobody was injured, is just £600'

Twice-married Mr Tooth, 74, whose reputation has earned him the nickname Jaws, could have been fined a total of up to £10,000. But magistrates decided he should only have to pay £600, a £30 ‘victim surcharge’ and £85 costs, and be given five penalty points.

Now the owner of the Polo – which was written off – has claimed the sentence was too lenient and will not act as a deterrent.

Mr Tooth – whose motto is ‘Don’t get even, get Tooth’ – once helped Sadie Frost reportedly scoop a £4million lump sum, a £2million house and a £15,000-a-month allowance from Jude Law. 

Other previous clients include Cheryl Barrymore, who received £3.5million from husband Michael, and Eimear Montgomerie, who walked away from her marriage to golfer Colin with £15million.

He also advised Roman Abramovich’s former wife Irina on their split, which was estimated to have cost the oligarch hundreds of millions.

Video of the incident in Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea, shows Mr Tooth’s Mercedes reversing slowly into a parking space in March. Then, with the manoeuvre seemingly completed, it suddenly ploughs into the Polo parked behind before speeding away.

The vehicle’s owner, 23-year-old Tom Gayner, told the Daily Mail: ‘It seems so unfair that the punishment for a hit and run accident like this, even though nobody was injured, is just £600 and five penalty points. The sentence seems unduly lenient – certainly it is no deterrent for these type of offences.’

Mr Gayner, who works in sports marketing, lives with his society GP father and mother in Upper Cheyne Row.

Getting closer: He continues towards Tom Gayner's Volkswagen Polo, which is parked on the street

Oops!: The Mercedes went on to plough into the Polo, which Mr Gayner says was written off in the incident 

The road was in the headlines in 2004 when one of its residents, City banker John Monckton, was stabbed to death during a robbery at his home. Around that time a number of households clubbed together to buy CCTV cameras to improve security.

Mr Gayner said he was abroad when his car was damaged but his mother and a neighbour trawled through hours of CCTV footage which was then handed to police.

He added: ‘The insurance company paid out for the value of the car. It was worth a little over £2,000 when it was written off.’

Mr Tooth lives in an £8million house in Chelsea while his law firm, Sears Tooth, is based in Mayfair. He pleaded guilty when his case was heard before Bromley Magistrates on August 27. 

He was fined £300 after admitting driving without due care and attention, and ordered to pay a £30 surcharge plus £85 costs.

Mr Tooth also admitted a separate charge of failing to stop at the scene of an accident and was fined a further £300. 

Driving without due care carries a maximum sentence of a £5,000 fine and up to nine points. Failing to stop after an accident can result in up to ten points, a £5,000 fine and six months in jail.

Last night Mr Tooth said: ‘Whilst I cannot give you a detailed response, I can say that I told the police the particular mitigating circumstances, of which the court were informed, and presumably they were taken into account.

‘All that happened was whilst parking in the middle of the day I reversed into a parked car, having suffered a severe abdominal pain seconds before.’
