This is the picture that appears to show Montenegro
supporters leaning over railings and spitting at England and Chelsea defender Ashley
Cole.

Witnesses including Sportsmail photographer Kevin Quigley, report that the left back was subjected to the vile act as he took a throw-in during the second half of last night's 1-1 draw in Podgorica.

Players were targeted while taking corners and throw-ins
in the hostile atmosphere throughout the
crunch World Cup qualifying match, with England captain Steven Gerrard pelted with missiles thrown from the crowd.

How they stand: Group H

Gerrard had to remove debris from
around the corner flag in order to have a clear run-up to the ball.

But worse still, photographers from newspapers and
agencies who were pitch side during the game have privately reported that they
witnessed supporters leaning over the metal hoardings and spitting at England
players.  

One witness confirmed seeing Cole spat at ‘two or three
times’ while taking a throw-in.

Quigley
said: ‘From my end of the pitch I only saw it happen once but I couldn’t
believe what I’d seen. Ashley Cole was spat at as he collected the ball to take a throw-in deep in Montenegro's half.

‘It came from the same area of the stands where the home
supporters had set off flares earlier in the game. It was in the second half, while I was taking pictures
of the action, when I noticed something in the corner of my eye.

‘My lens was pointing the wrong way to capture it but
both myself and the photographer next to me looked to each other in disbelief.’

Cole is no stranger to being targeted by fans — he is
frequently abused even when playing with England due to his move to Chelsea and
previous misdemeanours during his marriage to pop star Cheryl Cole.

England goalkeeper Joe Hart also had objects, including a toilet roll, thrown at him and he said: 'You get all sorts of things thrown at you. A lighter, marker pen, a bottle of water.

'A toilet roll pinged off my head and wrapped round my shoulder.'

Montenegro manager Branko Brnovic spiced up the
atmosphere on the day before the game by accusing England of being a long-ball
team who were scared of the Montenegro team and their fans.

Fireworks: Montenegrin fans let off flares and smoke bombs during the World Cup group H qualifier last night

Before kick-off 
in the Group H World Cup qualifier in Podgorica, a number of Montenegro 
fans were filmed attacking one another in a vicious fight at the City 
Stadium.

The atmosphere 
in and around the stadium had been predictably hostile in the build up 
to the match, with riot police surrounding the arena as fans made their 
way to the ground.

There were also 
disturbing images of an England fan who had reportedly been involved in a
scuffle with a group of Montenegro supporters.
The man is being aided by a local police officer as he lies on the ground, clutching a nasty-looking head wound.

During the 
build-up to the match there were few other reports of trouble between 
either set of fans, and the home crowd impeccably observed England's 
national anthems with applause before and afterwards.

A number of supporters had flares on the street, as a heavy police presence patrolled around the ground.

England manager 
Roy Hodgson expected a raucous atmosphere for the vital match saying of 
the Montenegro supporters ahead of the game: 'The crowd here are very 
partisan. It is only the players who play.'
