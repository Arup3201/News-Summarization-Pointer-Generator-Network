Brendan Rodgers insisted that Dejan Lovren was happy to take a penalty before his miss ended Liverpool's Europa League hopes in Istanbul on Thursday.

Liverpool, who famously won the Champions League in a shootout at the Ataturk Stadium in 2005, suffered their first ever European defeat on penalties at the fourth attempt.

Lovren, who has struggled to live up to his £20million transfer fee from Southampton last summer, took his spot-kick ahead of more attacking players like Raheem Sterling with the teams tied at 4-4 in the shootout, and fired over the bar.

The summer signing was clearly distraught after his miss sent Brendan Rodgers side crashing out

'Yes he was happy to take one,' said Rodgers. 'You saw the penalty takers that opted to take one were all confident. The four before Dejan were very good penalty-takers. We've had experience already in a cup competition this year so we were happy with the takers and Dejan was confident.

'We're obviously disappointed for him because he played very well. Someone has to miss and unfortunately it was him. But they were all happy to take one.

'We're disappointed of course to go out in the manner we did. We didn't come to lose, we came to win and to qualify.

'Over course of the game we defended very well and limited them to very few chances, but the mistake we made we got punished for where we were just too deep.

'Obviously I'm proud of the team and the young players who gained experience in a fantastic atmosphere.

'We now just have to concentrate on a league campaign that's starting to go well for us. The object of our season is to win a cup but we've got an excellent opportunity in other competitions.'
