Everyone on the street will be doing a double-take when you carry around one of these cartoon-inspired bags created by Taipei-based design duo, Rika Lin and Chay Su

The quirky bags created created by Taipei-based design duo, Rika Lin and Chay Su, are designed to look like bold, colourful 2D drawings that have come to life. And they really do!

There's no doubt wandering down the street with one of these will make people do a double take.

This cool idea came to the designers one afternoon when the friends were sketching their dream designer bag.

They thought how amazing it would be if a 
two-dimensional hand-drawn illustration could come to life as a real 
bag so they then set off exploring the possibilities.

After much hard work, eventually they're brand 'Jump From Paper' was born.

'We love to confuse people, but more so, 
we love to see them burst out into laughter once they realize these are 
real bags.' said Chay and Rika, who aim to take fashion outside the 
proverbial box.

The girls, say they're 'addicted to collecting funny and weird stuff', and take inspiration for their designs from everything in their daily life.
