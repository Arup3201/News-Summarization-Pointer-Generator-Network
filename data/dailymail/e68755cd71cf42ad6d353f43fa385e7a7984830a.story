The anti-immigration party Ukip has been mocked for sending out propaganda leaflets delivered by a migrant from Bulgaria.  

Labour councillor Peter Wallace said he witnessed 'hypocrisy of the highest order' when he received the six-page party pamphlet posted through his door in Kent by the Eastern European.

When the leaflet, promoting anti-EU candidate David Little, was delivered  last month the Dover district councillor decided to approach the courier and find out where he was from.

Councillor Wallace said: 'After the leaflet came through the door I went up to a man and asked if he delivered it. He said he did deliver it but his English wasn't too good.

'He said in a thick accent he didn't like the leaflets but he was being paid to do it. I thought "bloody hell" it's a Bulgarian delivering these leaflets, that's a bit weird.

'It's particularly weird he's Bulgarian because last year Ukip were saying "the Bulgarian's are coming, they are going to take your jobs". But now we see that it's them who are employing them.' 

Councillor Wallace added: 'It's hypocrisy of the highest order, as well as flat out incompetent.'

The original tweet about this incident has been shared on Twitter more than 1,000 times. 

However, Ukip's Parliamentary candidate claimed his party is boosting the local economy by employing people and this case shows his party is 'non-discriminatory'.

Little has since applauded the Bulgarian man, who is employed by Kent Distributions, for handing out the leaflet on January 22.

He said: 'We wouldn't ask if they have got any Pakistanis, Jamaicans or people with ginger hair working for them, would we? We are a non-discriminatory party.

'I think it's absolutely fantastic UKIP is employing people and boosting the local economy. Shouldn't that be applauded?

'The young Bulgarian man has come here to make a better life for himself and he's been doing a fantastic job for us.' 

Both Labour and Conservative parties have used the leaflet company in the past, according to the distributors list of clients on its website.

Little previously came under fire after he posted a cartoon of Great Britain with an arrow showing African immigrants coming from 'Bongo Bongo Land' and 'millions and millions' of migrants coming from Eastern Europe.
