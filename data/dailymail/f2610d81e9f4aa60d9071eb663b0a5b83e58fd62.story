The Red Cross yesterday declared the Syrian  conflict a civil war as Damascus denied using heavy weapons in an attack on a village that left scores dead.

The significance of the move by the International Committee of the Red Cross is that international humanitarian law now applies throughout the country.

This means that attacks on civilians and abuse or killing of detainees can constitute war crimes.

Devastation: A Syrian boy walks past a burned-out house in the village of Treimsa, where rights activists say more than 150 people have been killed

The decision by the ICRC follows the escalation of the violence beyond the hotspots of Idlib, Homs and Hama.

Yesterday a Syrian foreign ministry 
spokesman claimed the attack on Tremseh last Thursday was not a massacre
 – as activists have claimed – but a military operation targeting armed 
fighters.

He said 37 gunmen and two civilians 
were killed – a far lower death toll than the estimates of up to 200 
dead put forward by anti-regime activists.

But the head of the United Nations 
observer mission has said monitors stationed near Tremseh saw the Syrian
 army using heavy weaponry and helicopters.

 to Moscow today to seek the help of Russian President Vladimir Putin – a
 key ally of Syria’s President Bashar Assad – in ending the conflict

The UN confirmed that it had found pools of blood, a burned-out school and damage from the use of heavy weapons in Treimsa.

But
 the Syrian government dismissed suggestions that innocent people had 
been attacked, claiming that 37 gunmen and only two civilians were 
killed in clashes with rebels.

Blast site: Syrians point to the spot where a shell apparently fell in Treimsa. The UN said there was evidence that heavy weapons had been used

Observers believe more than 150 
people were killed, which if confirmed would make it one of the 
bloodiest episodes of Syria’s 16-month uprising.

Fifteen
 more people were killed elsewhere in the country today, activists said.
 Among them was a family of four, including a girl whose body was pulled
 from rubble covered in blood and dust after their house was shelled in 
the central town of Rastan.

The
 claims and counter-claims arose as UN-Arab League Kofi Annan prepared 
to travel to Moscow for talks with President Vladimir Putin on the 
crisis.

Russia
 has been an ally of Syrian leader President Bashar al-Assad and his 
government, but has come under increased international pressure to 
support regime change.

Panic: UN monitors confirmed that they had found pools of blood and a burned school in the village

Speaking at a news conference in the capital Damascus, foreign ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi said Syrian government forces did not use helicopters and tanks in the assault on Treimsa, which happened on Thursday.

'What happened was not an attack by the army on innocent civilians,' he added.

'The aim of this news conference is to tell people that what happened was not a massacre... It was a clash between regular forces and armed groups who do not believe in a peaceful solution.

UN monitors are verifying reports of damage and killings in the village of Treimsa, north of the Syrian capital Damascus

'This is the reality, politically and militarily.'

Mr Makdissi staunchly denied reports suggesting the army had used aircraft in the assault.

'This is absolutely not true. Only troop carriers and lights weapons were used, the most powerful of weapons being RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades),' he said.

He admitted that 'the situation is 
difficult on the ground' but insisted that Syria is 'in a state of 
defence not in a state of attack'.

'Only five buildings where there were very sophisticated weapons were targeted,' he added.

The spokesman's announcement came as UN monitors continued their investigation into what happened in the village.

During a trip to the scene yesterday, they found blood and evidence of the use of heavy weapons as well as burned-out homes.

Sausan
 Ghosheh, spokeswoman for the supervision mission, said: 'On the basis 
of this preliminary mission, UNSMIS can confirm that an attack, using a 
variety of weapons, took place in Treimsa on July 12.

'The attack on Treimsa appeared targeted at specific groups and houses, mainly of army defectors and activists.

'There were pools of blood and blood spatters in rooms of several homes together with bullet cases.

Inquiry: Syrian men give their witness accounts to Danish Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dahl, a United Nations observer team member

Evidence: Villagers show UN observers the remains of projectiles apparently fired during the assault

Fact finding: Villagers gather around vehicles carrying UN observers as they arrive to investigate the bloodshed

Rubble: Villagers inspect the damage following the assault

Claim: They Syrian government insisted that only five buildings, said to be holding very sophisticated weapons, were targeted

'The UN team also observed a burned school and damaged houses with signs of internal burning in five of them.'

Ms Ghosheh added that a 'wide range of weapons were used, including artillery, mortars and small arms'.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which made the claim of more than 150 fatalities, said it believed the army had been backed by pro-regime shabiha militiamen.

If confirmed, the toll would exceed that of a massacre at Houla on May 25, when a pro-government militia and government forces were accused of killing at least 108 people.

The killings have added urgency to deadlocked UN Security Council negotiations on a Syria resolution.

UN Security-General Ban Ki-moon appealed for action to stop the bloodshed and called on China, a key player in a Security Council dispute over proposed sanctions against the Middle East nation, to influence Assad.
