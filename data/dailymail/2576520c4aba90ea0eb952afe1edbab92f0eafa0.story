Every newscaster’s worst nightmare is to let slip with something inappropriate while still live on air and that’s exactly what happened to Justin Kraemer of Wichita NBC affiliate KSNW on Saturday night.

Kraemer and his co-hosts were signing off for the night just before Saturday Night Live at about 11.30 p.m. when the embarrassing incident occurred.

The credits had started to roll and the screen shot had just switched to a lovely image of the Wichita, Kansas, skyline at night when poor old Kraemer could clearly be heard to murmur to his co-hosts ‘let’s get the f*** out of here.’

Anchorman 2 opens in cinemas across the country later this week, but Wichita it seems already has its very own Ron Burgundy in the shape of the unfortunate Kraemer.

Kraemer, originally from New York state, is an experienced hand in local news and has worked for KSN since 2008.

He has worked as a reporter for more than a decade, according the station’s website, and has worked alongside Brian Williams on MSNBC and on CNN. 

On an earlier stint with KSN, Kramer won an Emmy for spot news reporting. He is now one of the main anchors for main anchors for the station and anchors on weekend evenings.

The channel is an NBC affiliate based in Wichita and broadcasts news to the west of Kansas and along with its sister stations claims to cover 75 per cent of the state.

As the credits start to roll and the screen shot switches to an image of the Wichita skyline, Kraemer can clearly be heard murmuring to his co-hosts 'let's get the f*** out of here'
