Workers at a Chicago animal shelter were horrified last week when a homeless dog's x-ray revealed he's been shot full of dozens of BB gun pellets.

Porkchop is described by the folks at One Tail at a Time as one of the most loveable pooches imaginable, but he suffered some of the most shocking abuse employees had seen during his time as a stray.

'I immediately started crying at my desk at work,' said one shelter employee.

Porkchop used to have a home in Carbondale, Illinois, but he starting roaming the streets after his owner died.

Workers at One Tail at a Time told the Huffington Post they believe Porkchop was shot by neighbors in the area where he scrounged for food.

Once they discovered the horror Porkchop had been through, they immediately started to spread the word about the resilient pup.

Adorable: The workers at his shelter say Porkchop is the sweetest dog imaginable but has suffered some of the nastiest abuse they've seen

A Facebook post on the shelter's page that showed Porkchop's x-ray has received nearly 3.000 shares and has been 'liked' 2,000 times.

Soon the shelter posted more adorable shots of of the 65-pound shepherd/retriever mix as a thank you for the donations that started flooding in after they told his story.

'People have been so moved by him and what he's been through as an amazing, resilient dog,' Anna Friedman, who's in charge of adoptions, told HuffPost.

The shelter held an adoption event last weekend to find Porkchop, and their many other animals, a home. They received quite a few applications for him and expect he'll be at his new home soon.
