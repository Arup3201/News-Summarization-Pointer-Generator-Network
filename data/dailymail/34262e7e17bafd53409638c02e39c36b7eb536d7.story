Two teenage girls have been charged with abuse after filming themselves laughing as they hit an elderly resident at the Illinois care home they worked in.

Chemyra Barnett and Jacqueline Santos, who are both 18, were charged with aggravated battery of a person over 60, and unlawful videotaping in court on Friday.Â 

The teenagers have also been banned from the Rosewood Care Center, where they were alleged to have hit a 98-year-old woman.

Police were called to the care home on Thursday, after another employee contacted them to report the alleged abuse.

Barnett and Santon, who had both worked at the home for less than a year, could be seen laughing as they struck the elderly woman, who has dementia, according to court documents.

The young nursing assistants are also accused of sharing the video with friends.

Their alleged victim, who has not been named, was not injured in the attack.

'It's just a sad situation all around,' police spokeswoman Lisa Blackwell told the Chicago Tribune.

Bail has been set at $15,000 each for the pair, who are due to appear in court again on March 27.

As part of their bail conditions, Barnett and Santon were banned from going to the care center or contacting the victim or her family.

They have also been banned from having a cell phone or sharing the video.

Ivy Gleeson, the nursing home administrator, confirmed that the nursing assistants had been fired, adding: 'In our facility, resident safety is our utmost concern.'
