Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman has been named the 'the world's most powerful drug trafficker' by the U.S. Treasury department.

The fugitive Sinaloa cartel leader also got a boost from Mexican actress Kate Del Castillo, who said she believed in Guzman more than in the government - but pleaded with him to use his influence for good.

It was the latest in an odd series of encomiums for Guzman, who was included this year on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, with an estimated fortune of $1 billion.

Billionaire: Mexican Joaquin Guzman, aka El Chapo, has been declared the world's most influential drug trafficker.

The U.S. Embassy in Mexico City issued a statement saying three of Guzman's alleged associates had been hit with sanctions under the drug Kingpin Act, which prohibits people in the U.S. from conducting businesses with them and freezes their U.S. assets.

The two Mexican men and a Colombian allegedly aided Guzman's trafficking operations.

The statement quoted Adam J. Szubin, director of the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, as saying the move 'marks the fourth time in the past year that OFAC has targeted and exposed the support structures of the organization led by Chapo Guzman, the world's most powerful drug trafficker.'

Plea: Kate del Castillo posted a message to the drug lord

Guzman, who escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001 in a laundry truck and has a $7 million bounty on his head, has long been recognized as Mexico's most powerful drug capo.

Authorities say his Sinaloa cartel 
has recently been expanding his drug business abroad, building 
international operations in Central and South America and the Pacific.

Del
Castillo, who played a female drug trafficker in the TV series 'La 
Reina del Sur' ('Queen of the South'), offered grudging praise for 
Guzman in a posting Tuesday on the social media site Twextra, linked to 
her Twitter account.

'Today, I believe more in El Chapo Guzman than in the governments who hide truths from me,' she wrote.

The
actress did not specify whether she was referring to the Mexican 
government, or what she meant when she accused 'governments' of 'hiding 
the cures for cancer, AIDS, etc. for their own benefit and enrichment.'

The 800-word posting ended with an impassioned plea to Guzman:

'Mr. Chapo, wouldn't it be great if you 
started trafficking with positive things? With cures for diseases, with 
food for street children, with alcohol for old people's homes so they 
spend their final days doing whatever they like, trafficking with 
corrupt politicians and not with women and children who wind up as 
slaves?'

'Go ahead, dare to, sir, you would be the hero of heroes, let's traffick with love, you know how,' the message concluded.

In a scoop for Mexican authorities, on Tuesday they seized 32.6 metric tons of a precursor chemical used to make methamphetamines at the Pacific coast port of Manzanillo.

Swoop: In December the Mexican navy seized 120,000 kilograms of methylamine at the Pacific port of Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico

Mexico's navy said the chemical methylamine came in a shipment from China, but did not say whether Manzanillo was the final destination of the shipment.

Authorities seized almost 675 metric tons of the chemical at sea ports in December alone, all of which was destined for Guatemala.

Experts say that when another chemical is added, methylamine can yield its weight in uncut meth.
