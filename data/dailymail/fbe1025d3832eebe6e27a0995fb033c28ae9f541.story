A Texas City mother discovered a used syringe in her 11-year-old son's trash Sunday.

When Rena Alvarado discovered her young son was using methamphetamine, she contacted Texas City police, hoping that if the boy were arrested he would have access to drug rehabilitation.

But according to Alvarado, police refused to take the syringe as evidence and have done little to track down the person who sold her son the drugs.

At a loss: Rena Alvarado hoped Texas City police could help after she discovered a syringe used to inject meth in her son's trash

Alvarado was tidying her son's room when a used syringe fell out of a trash bag.

According to the Galveston Daily News, she was horrified when her 11-year-old son confirmed her worst fears to his father, admitting that he had been injecting himself with the drug for the past few months.

With her 11-year-old son hooked on the strongest form of meth, Alvarado was at a loss, so she called the Texas City Police Department.

'I showed him the syringe and everything, and he did not want to have anything to do with it,' Alvarado told KHOU.

Evidence: Alvarado said police refused to take the syringe as evidence, so she has kept it herself even though the site of it makes her cry

Alvarado has kept the syringe in a ziplock bag as evidence.

'I donâ€™t want to keep it because every time I see it, it hurts me. Every time I see my son going through the symptoms he is having, it hurts me,' she told KHOU.

'I kept it because I have to find him help.'

According to KHOU, Alvarado's son says he bought the meth from a 13-year-old at the New City Skate Park.

'No one's doing anything about it,' she told KHOU.

Alvarado told KHOU that her son is now experiencing withdrawal symptoms including vomiting and shaking. She and her son have an appointment with a drug counselor, but not until Thursday.

KHOU reports that the Texas City Police Chief told a KHOU reporter that he is not familiar with the case and will be looking into it.
