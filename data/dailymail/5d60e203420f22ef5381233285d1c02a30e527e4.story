Perhaps all she wanted was a tantalising clump of grass on the cliff edge. If so, for one Dartmoor pony grazing 300ft above Rame Head in Cornwall, it was a munch too far.

After slithering 230ft, she was left stranded on a ledge for four days before a 40-strong team of professionals saved her from a  lingering death.

The alarm was raised by RSPCA inspector Peter Ferris after local residents reported the pony’s plight.

What a donkey! Somehow, the pony managed to tumble over a 300ft cliff at Rame Head, East Cornwall

This lasso's never going to work: The Dartmoor pony slithered down 230ft before coming to a stop on a ledge

Easy does it: Amazing, she survived and remained stuck there for four days until a fireman was lowered on ropes to help her

Com back here! The fireman coaxed her safely on to the beach and then had to carefully usher her across the sand towards fellow rescuers

Then in came coastguards, firemen specialising in mineshaft rescues, the RSPCA’s own rescue team, a crew from Plymouth-based 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines and a vet armed with a tranquilliser dart powerful enough to knock out a rhino.

Cornwall Fire and Rescue Service group manager Martin Wingrove, who led the operation, said: ‘The pony was none the worse afterwards although she quickly downed a bucket of water.

‘The real mystery is how on earth she managed to get down so far and survive.

‘It was as if she had been plucked off the clifftop and placed there.’

Saving Private Pony: As the beach was accessible only by sea, a crew from Plymouth-based 539 Assault Squadron Royal Marines, who were on a routine training exercise, stepped in to help

All aboard! The rescue operation ferried in vet Sam Pawson who fired a tranquiliser dart at the animal. The sedated pony was strapped to a raft, which was floated out to a landing craft and dragged aboard

Steady ass she goes: Mission accomplished, the landing craft - accompanied by a Marines sail boat - carefully sets sail from the beach. A Marines spokesman commended rescuers 'deftness and flexibility'. Not surprisingly, he admitted 'there is no standard procedure for this activity'.

Hitting the hay: Back on dry land, the pony sleeps off the effects of the tranquiliser. RSPCA inspector Peter Ferris says she has been named Marina in honour of the Marines

Stable condition: Back on her hooves and feeling her old self again, the mare is visited by Mr Ferris. 'Now all I've got do is find her owner,' he said. 'If no one comes forward, I might adopt her myself.'
