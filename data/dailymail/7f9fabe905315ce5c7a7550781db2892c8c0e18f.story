Women are still paid less then men across the UK and Europe for doing exactly the same job, damning figures reveal.

Hourly pay rates for women across Europe are on average 16 per cent lower than for men doing the same work and 19.5 per cent lower in the UK, latest figures reveal today.

The gap was highlighted on the eve of European Equal Pay Day - a moveable annual event marked this year on February 28 - the 59th day of the year reflecting the number of extra days women must work to earn 'equal' pay.

Regardless of whether they do the same job, men get paid more on average than their female counterparts

The situation is improving, the European Commission hastened to point out today: the first Equal Pay Day, in 2011, was held on March 5 and last year it was on March 2.

That reflects a closing of the pay gap from 17.5 per cent to 16. per cent over three years with today’s latest figures reflecting the position across Europe in 2010.

The biggest gender pay gap is nearly 28 per cent in Estonia, with the UK's 19.5 per cent the eighth biggest in the 27 member states.

Ireland’s pay gap is at 13.9 per cent and the lowest is Slovenia’s 0.9 per cent.

'European Equal Pay Day reminds us of the unequal pay conditions women still face in the labour market ,'said EU Justice and Fundamental Rights Commissioner Viviane Reding.

'While the pay gap has declined in the recent years, there’s no reason to celebrate. The pay gap is still very large and much of the change actually resulted from a decline in men’s earnings rather than an increase for women.'

She added: 'The principle of equal pay for equal work is written in the EU Treaties since 1957. It is high time that it is put in practice everywhere.'

The commission says the gradual reduction in the pay gap is not necessarily thanks to improving pay and working conditions for women.

It may reflect the economic downturn’s impact primarily on male-dominated sectors such as construction and engineering.

The issue will be discussed next month at a gathering of more than 150 companies in Brussels to exchange equal pay 'best practice'.

A commission report on tightening EU equal pay rules and on how companies should conduct 'gender-neutral job evaluation and job classification systems' is due to be published in the summer.

Brussels also wants EU governments to organise their own 'national equal pay days' to put the spotlight on the need for pay parity between the sexes.

But while UK women may be paid almost a fifth less compared to their male colelagues, they have more in the bank,

Despite being paid less than men, women savers have about £500 more in the bank than their male counterparts, according to the Halifax.

In terms of share of wages, the gap is still more striking: women have 41 per cent of their annual salary in savings, while men have just 23 per cent.

The bank says the average man among its account holders has saved up £7,699 – against £8,211, or £512 more, for women.

The finding holds true in all regions across England and Wales.

The Trades Union Congress analysis, which is based on figures from the Office for National Statistics, says the pay gap also translates into smaller pensions.

It found that women aged from 50 to 59 endure the widest gender pay gap of any age group.

In their 20s, women typically earn more than men and in their 30s they fall only slightly behind. But the gap grows rapidly in their 40s and reaches a peak in their 50s.
