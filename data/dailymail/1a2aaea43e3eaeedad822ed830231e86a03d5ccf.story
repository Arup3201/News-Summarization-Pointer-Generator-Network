A popular teddy bear sold across North America is being recalled - because of fears its plastic eyes could fall out and choke children to death.

The Build-A-Bear Workshop company has issued the urgent warning for 300,000 of its Chinese-made Colourful Hearts Teddy Bears, which it sells in the U.S. and Canada.

No injuries have been reported so far - but it is the third time this year the DIY stuffed animal workshop, which has stores across the world including the UK, has had safety concerns over its products.

Faulty: The 16in high Colourful Hearts Teddy Bear has black plastic eyes and sells in the U.S. for $18

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission warned parents to be on their guard if they had bought their children the 16in high bear that has black plastic eyes and sells in the U.S. for $18.

It said: 'The Teddy Bear's eyes could loosen and fall out, posing a choking hazard to children.'

The company revealed the bears were sold at its stores and through its website from April to December. A total of 284,000 in the U.S. and 13,200 in Canada are affected.

A statement said: 'Consumers should immediately take the recalled teddy bear from children and return it to any Build-A-Bear store to receive a coupon for any available stuffed animal from Build-A-Bear.'

It also advised buyers to contact the firm at 866-236-5683 with additional questions.

The recall is the final blow to what has been a humiliating year for the firm, which was fined $6,000 earlier this month by the CPSC for failing to report a dangerous defect in its toy beach chairs sold between 2001 and 2009.

A CPSC statement said: 'The sharp edges of the chair's folding wooden frame can pinch, lacerate or amputate a child's fingertip if the finger is caught between the frame as the chair is folded.

'The company became aware of 10 reports of injury between July 2007 and January 2009, yet did not report to the Commission until March 2009.'

And in August the company voluntarily recalled 26,500 Love Hugs Peace Lapel Pins, also manufactured in China, that contained excessive amounts of lead-based paint.

Build-A-Bear spokesman Jill Saunders told STLtoday.com the latest blunder could be down to 'substandard fabric' may be to blame for the eyes tearing out of the toy.

She said: 'We discovered the issue while doing ongoing quality and safety checks and immediately reported the issue to the CPSC and began the recall process.

'That we have conducted three product recalls this year despite the fact that we have not received a single injury report related to any of those three products clearly demonstrates how seriously we take product safety.'

Ed Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate working for the National Association of State Public Interest Research Groups, said the firm needed to review its management and risk analysis.

He said: 'This company - its recent time line - gives me some concern that they really need to review their management and their risk analysis to make sure they are in compliance with the law to protect children.'
