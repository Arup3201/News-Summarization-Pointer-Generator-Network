After deliberating for less than an hour, a jury in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, found a babysitter guilty for the first-degree murder of a toddler who was in her care. They suggested a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.

The babysitter, 50-year-old Van Le, was tried for murdering 2-year-old Jessica Chau, the niece she had been babysitting for a year. Jessica died on September 24 after suffering for two days from injuries sustained under her aunt's watch.

Le testified that she was only trying to revive Jessica, who was not feeling well and wasn't breathing. She picked her up, shook her, and put her on the floor 'very hard.'

'I never hurt Jessica. I love Jessica,' Le said.

But Le's testimony was countered with that of her 8-year-old son, who is now living with a foster family. He said his mother got angry with Jessica for jumping on the bed, so she grabbed the girl by the legs and slammed her head on the floor 'twice or several times.'

The prosecutor acted this out for the jury, slamming a book and yelling 'quit jumping on the bed' to illustrate the force.

Jessica was hospitalized for two days with a fractured skull and brain and eye injuries before dying on September 24.

Mina Chau, Jessica's mother, had been leaving both Jessica and her 6-year-old daughter in the care of Le for about a year, while she worked at a nail salon.

Jessica was 'playful' that morning, Chau testified, and had been riding a little pink bike before being dropped off at Le's house.

After the medical testimony, prosecutors say that Le changed her story to fit what doctor's said about Jessica's injury, something Assistant District Attorney Gayland Gieger believes attributed to the jury's speedy deliberation.Â 

'I think the strength of the evidence is shown by the relatively short time the jury was out deliberating,' Gieger told NewsOK. 'She significantly changed her account of what happened after she heard the medical testimony.

'I think it's clear to all of us that she was lying to you,' Assistant District Attorney Marcy Fassio said in her closing argument. 'Clearly she has a motivation to lie to you.'

Le will be sentenced on June 27.
