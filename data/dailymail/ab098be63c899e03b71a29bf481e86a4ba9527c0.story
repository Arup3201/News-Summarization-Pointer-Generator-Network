Kolo Toure always knew that Liverpool would turn things around after a difficult start to their Premier League campaign and has cited manager Brendan Rodgers as the reason.

Despite coming within two points of winning the title last season, the Reds initially struggled this term after losing Luis Suarez and bringing in a raft of new signings - losing four of their opening five league games.

However, Liverpool have been the form team of 2015, winning seven and drawing two of their league games to challenge for a Champions League place while reaching the quarter-finals of the FA Cup.

Toure has hailed 'intelligent' Rodgers for making Liverpool the Premier League form team of 2015

Speaking to The Independent, Toure said: I'm not surprised by the turn around because the manager is great, really intelligent in working out problems.

'He pays attention to every detail, tries different things, pushes players so you don't get lazy. We had a lot of new players coming in, especially young ones from abroad who had to settle in.

'I moved to England when I was 21 so i know it takes time to fit in, to learn. I knew that eventually it would all come together, and that is what the boss kept telling us as well.'

Toure, who has returned from winning the Africa Cup of Nations with the Ivory Coast, could become the first player in history to win the FA Cup with three different clubs, having already collected the trophy with Arsenal (2003, 2005) and Manchester City (2011).

Although the 33-year-old has been used as a substitute in Liverpool's last two games, he understands that he is not guaranteed playing time at Anfield. 

'When you're with a big team like Liverpool, you can't expect to start every game, especially because I was a way with the Ivory Coast for almost a month.

'But I am always ready to contribute whether it is on the pitch or in the dressing room. We have a team that's hungry for success, with exciting young players that I help guide with experience. The winning mentality is really, really strong.'
