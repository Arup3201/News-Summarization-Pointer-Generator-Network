Swansea City right back Dwight Tiendalli has joined Middlesbrough on loan until the end of the season. 

The 29-year-old has only managed one Premier League start this season - a 5-0 defeat by Chelsea at the Liberty Stadium in January - and has fallen out of contention at the south Wales club.

Garry Monk signed Kyle Naughton from Tottenham in the January transfer window while Angel Rangel signed a contract extension earlier this month.

Tiendalli's last appearance for the Swans came in their disappointing 3-1 FA Cup fourth round exit at the hands of Blackburn.

Michael Laudrup brought Tiendalli to the Liberty Stadium as a free agent two and a half years ago following a two-year stint at Eredivisie club Twente.

The full back, who has been capped twice for Holland, will now try to help Aitor Karanka's side win promotion to the Premier League.

Middlesbrough are currently third in Championship and just one point behind league leaders Bournemouth.
