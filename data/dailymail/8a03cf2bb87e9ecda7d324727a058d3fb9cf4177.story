Ever wondered the secret to making perfect ice cream?

Well wonder no more, because the science of the sweet has been revealed in a video that explains the methods to get different results.

From hard and ‘crunchy’ to a softer treat, YouTube channel Reactions takes a look at how the consistency of ice cream depends on the rate at which it is cooled.

What's the science behind getting creamy or hard ice cream (stock image shown)? In a new video YouTube channel Reactions explains how the faster ice cream is cooled, the smoother it will be. This is because a rapid freezing process makes smaller crystals, leading to a creamier treat

In the video, it is explained how the crystals in ice cream determine the consistency.

A gene linked to obesity, which makes ice cream and sugary foods tastier for girls, was discovered by scientists last year.

Researchers
 claim the discovery of the gene means it might not be our fault if we 
make poor food choices - and could partly help explain obesity.

Contrary
 to 'blaming' obese people for making poor food choices, the Canadian 
researchers say that obesity is caused by genetic predisposition, 
environmental stress and emotional wellbeing.

They discovered a gene variant - or allele - which regulates the production of the pleasure hormone, dopamine.

The
 findings, published in the journal Appetite, could be an important step
 towards prevention and treatment of the condition, they claim.

Professor
 Michael Meaney of McGill University, Montreal, said: 'In broad terms, 
we are finding that obesity is a product of genetics, early development 
and circumstance.'

‘What you’re doing when you make creamy ice cream is you control the size of ice crystals in your ice cream,’ says Dr Matthew Hartings from the American University in the video.

He explains that ice crystals start off as a ‘hexagonal shape’.

When more ice is added the crystals grow, and the bigger they get, the crunchier the final ice cream becomes.

For a creamier treat, the crystals need to be small.

There are two ways to do that, the first being to use an emulsifier.

This keeps the water molecules and fats mixed together, preventing the water freezing in clumps and allowing for smaller ice crystals.

The second way is to change the rate at which the water freezes; the faster it cools, the smaller the crystals and the smoother the ice cream.

In the video Dr Matthew Hartings from the American University in Washington DC shows how three different methods can produce ice cream with different textures. The smoothest ice cream is created when liquid nitrogen (pictured) is used to rapidly cool the treat, while the crunchiest stems from using salt and ice in a bag

To test this, Dr Hartings makes ice cream in three ways: using an ice cream maker, then salt and ice in a bag and finally using liquid nitrogen.

The salt and ice method produces the ‘crunchiest’ ice cream as it takes the longest to cool.

Next up is the ice cream maker, which takes about 30 minutes, while the much faster liquid nitrogen produces the smoothest results.

Dr Hartings also explains that mixing the ice cream ensures air spreads through it, helping with flavour and stability.

And it’s also noted how the cold temperature numbs the taste buds on the tongue, meaning lots of sugar and fat is needed in ice cream, which is why melted ice cream tastes sweeter.

But, the video concludes, 'we’re not saying you have to buy liquid nitrogen and start blasting your ice cream with it, but at least you now know why your ice cream treat is so silky smooth.’
