Mocking hecklers is part of the job for stand-up comedians.

But this comic was somewhat lost for words when an NYPD officer shouted 'shut the f*** up' from the back of the room.

The cop was one of four who interrupted Adam Newman's set with flashlights to arrest a homeless man allegedly masturbating in the audience.

And it seemed they couldn't resist joining in on the show.

Unexpected guests: Adam Newman was interrupted mid-show last night as four police officers came in to arrest a homeless man who was allegedly masturbating in the audience at New York's UCB Theatre

Newman, 31, was telling a joke about shampoo that had his fans in stitches at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Chelsea, New York City.

But the next joke was cut off when four police officers barged into the room with flashlights.

True to form, the stand-up tried to make the event part of his show.

'Well this is the first time this has happened,' he joked, as the audience fell about laughing.

He continues: 'Guys, this is part of the act, I do this every show.'

Playing around: The comic laughs and jokes while posing for a picture with the squad behind him

Jokes on him: But when a police officer heckles 'shut the f*** up' he has no idea what to retort

But he was lost for words when an officer retorts: 'What is happening?'

Newman looks shocked 

He stammers in disbelief: 'I have no idea what is going on. Couldn't you have waited until the end of my set?'

One retorts: 'Obviously not. Honestly, shut the f*** up'

Silence.

'Who? Me?' Newman asks.

'Oooh...are you yelling at me?' he tentatively replied.

'Shut your mouth, all right?' the officer snapped.

Shocked: When they left Newman gaped at his audience members in shock, 'what the f*** just happened!'

Popular venue: The Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in Chelsea saw an unusual interruption for comic Adam Newman

At this point Newman apologized and waited for the officers to leave - as the audience wooped and cheered. 

A video, posted on Newman's YouTube profile, shows the comic then exclaiming: 'What the f*** just happened!

'I've dealt with hecklers before and I can put a heckler in their place, I can do that, but if I yelled "you shut the fuck up" to a police officer...?

'If an audience said 'shut the f*** up' I would've gone crazy, but when a police officer yells 'shut the f*** up" I'm like "yes sorry!'
