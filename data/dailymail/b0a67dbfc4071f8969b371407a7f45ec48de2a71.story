A teacher at a prestigious Catholic High School just north of San Francisco is suing the school, claiming that the school failed to protect her against sexual harassment, including having male students compete to take up-skirt videos of her and other teachers.

In a lawsuit filed Thursday against the all-boys Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, Kimberly Bohnert claims that administrators failed to protect her against a 'boys will be boys' environment where she was subjected to sexually explicit images and tweets regarding her.

'It's a very athletic school and sometimes sports are put forward more than moral development,' Bohnert, 38, told the Contra Costa Times. She also suing the Roman Catholic Diocese of San Francisco, which oversees the school.

Kimberly Bohnert, 38, a teacher at Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California, is suing the school as she claims administrators did nothing to stop sexual harassment from students at the all-male school that include taking up-skirt photos and writing sexually explicit graffiti in the bathroom

Bohnert, who is suing the school, as well as the Archdiocese of San Francisco, which operates it, shows off a printout of some of the sexually explicit Twitter comments student at Serra High School posted online

The suit also seeks back pay and punitive damages.

Serra is considered a prestigious Catholic school. It counts a number of famous athletes among its graduates, including baseball player Barry Bonds and football players Tom Brady and Lynn Swann.

In response to the allegations, the school, with 840 students and 64 teachers -- 21 of which are women -- released a statement.

'Last year's incident was tragic, and the
 disrespect shown by certain former students did not reflect what we 
teach and model here at Serra High School,' school President Lars Lund 
wrote. 'We felt a deep level of compassion for the teacher. We 
immediately contacted the San Mateo Police Department and fully 
cooperated with them during our mutual investigations.'

He added an assembly for students 
was held describing the legal ramifications of inappropriate texting and
 Internet activities.

Ultimately action was taken: Six students, all minors, were expelled and six were suspended. And San Mateo police referred the six juveniles 'most culpable for producing and distributing the images' to the San Mateo County Juvenile Probation Department, police Sergeant David Norton said.

Bohnert, however, said the actions taken by the school were not enough and harassment from male students gave her no choice but to go on leave due to concerns for her safety.

'I'm hoping for the administration to recognize the seriousness of the issue and I'm hoping the school makes some real change to make Serra a better place and to allow these boys to be in a culture that respects one another,' she said. Her lawsuit also seeks back pay and unspecified general and punitive damages.

Bohnert started teaching at Serra during the 2006-07 school year. In her second year, a female English teacher had her buttocks photographed and shared by students, she said said. During her third year, a student was caught in the act of taking an up-skirt photo of another teacher.

'It was very hush-hush,' Bohnert said. 'I was really shocked. I guess I could say I was naive on some level. I trusted the kids.'

School staff found sexually explicit graffiti in a bathroom wall about Bohnert in February 2012, according to her suit. She claims administrators said they would investigate, but she never heard anything back from them. 

'I was hoping the students would be held accountable,' Bohnert said. 'To not get any resolution spoke volumes about how the kids could get away with anything.'

In November of the same year, sexually explicit tweets targeting Bohnert were discovered. But administrators again did nothing, Bohnert claims.
