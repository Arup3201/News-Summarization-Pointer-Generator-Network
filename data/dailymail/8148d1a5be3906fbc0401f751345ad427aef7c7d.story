ASDA has claimed a victory over its thriving budget rival Aldi by getting a TV ad, which claimed to offer savings of £45 a week, banned.

Asda, Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s are under fierce pressure because millions have switched to the likes of Aldi and Lidl during the cost of living squeeze.

The big four have lost billions in sales to their budget rivals, which have mounted aggressive campaigns to target middle income families.

Aldi's 'Swap & Save' advert featured a mum who said she saved £45 a week by switching from her usual supermarket

Now, they are fighting back with price cuts of their own and attempts to undermine the discount claims of Aldi.

Central to Aldi’s attack has been its ‘Swap & Save’ campaign, boasting that families can make significant cuts to the cost of the weekly groceries by switching away from big brands and big supermarkets.

But the campaign has been seriously undermined following a complaint from Asda, which has today been upheld by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA).

The commercial, which ran in September and October last year, featured a real mum called Tracey who had shopped at her usual store for four weeks and then switched to Aldi, apparently saving £45 a week.

She said: ‘I was very pleasantly surprised at the variety - the fresh food, the meat, the fruit and veg - it’s cheap and it’s good.

Asda complained that the shopper in the Aldi advert bought different products and prices were based on 2013 and so could be out-of-date

‘I think £45 a week is a lot of money given that we’ve got to spread it so thinly amongst so many things. So it’s definitely worth doing for us. Meaning that we can go on an extra holiday a year.’

The commercial was pre-vetted by a body called Clearcast, which is owned by the commercial broadcasters and advises companies on TV marketing rules. However, Asda made five complaints, all of which have been upheld by the advertising watchdog.

It pointed out that the family used in the commercial did not buy the same items when shopping at the two supermarkets, which meant it was not a fair comparison.

The survey did not include all the comparable items bought at the two stores and so could give Aldi an unfair advantage, while the figures behind the claimed saving of £45 were not clear.

Asda pointed out that the price comparisons were made in the April to May period of 2013 and therefore may not have still been relevant when the commercial appeared.

It also complained it would be wrong to imply that a shopper could always save £45 a week.

Despite a watchdog finding the advert was 'misleading', Aldi insists the 'overall message remains true'

The ASA said the lack of specific information in the commercial ‘created a misleading impression of the overall benefit to viewers of shopping at the advertiser’s stores rather than those of their competitors’.

In its defence, Aldi insisted the commercial never claimed specific savings on a product by product basis, but rather pointed out how real families could make a saving on their total weekly shop.

Asda promotes itself as the cheapest of the mainstream supermarkets. As a result it is particularly sensitive to the price cut claims of Aldi, which is quickly moving into the big league with sales growing at more than 30per cent a year.

A recent Daily Mail survey on a small basket of 17 comparable items found Aldi was around £5 cheaper than Asda.

Aldi said it was ‘wholly disappointed’ by the ASA’s decision. It said: ‘The Swap & Save adverts are based on the actual savings of shoppers and the overall advertising message remains true.

‘It is no surprise that other supermarkets are trying to find issue with our campaign as we continue to impress shoppers with both the price and quality of what we sell.

‘We are confident that Aldi offers some of the best value and lowest prices in the UK, and that we do this every day as opposed to during promotional periods that you may find in other supermarkets.’
