Bad job: Dr Bijan Saha, a GP, caught at the till of his Indian restaurant in Kent

Family doctors are moonlighting at private surgeries while their NHS patients are forced to wait weeks for appointments.

An investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found dozens of GPs earning huge sums by taking time out from their NHS jobs to treat private patients.

Many are happy to carry out private consultations in the evenings and weekends – even though their profession has strongly resisted Government pressure to open NHS surgeries at these times. While patients who can pay up to £100 for a private appointment can be seen within hours, NHS patients must wait for up to three weeks.

The doctors are not breaking any rules, but critics say their absence from NHS surgeries for many hours every week is severely limiting the time available for appointments.

The revelations come after figures from the Royal College of GPs showed that one in six of all consultations last year – some 47 million appointments –involved a wait of at least a week to see a doctor or nurse.

A snapshot survey by this newspaper has found:

Last night, critics condemned the arrangements. Katherine Murphy, of the Patients’ Association, said: ‘You would expect their first duty of care to be with their patients. It’s interesting that GPs can pick and choose where and when they work, but patients don’t have that luxury.’

Even other doctors echoed the criticism. Dr Richard Willis, who left the NHS to run a private practice in Salisbury, Wiltshire, said: ‘I would certainly feel very uncomfortable if I looked after a mix of NHS and private patients and NHS patients had to wait significantly longer to be seen than patients who were able to pay.’

Our investigation has uncovered at least 50 GPs who spend several hours a week with paying customers. Their NHS patients often have to wait days for appointments after struggling to get through on the phone. By contrast, receptionists in private surgeries answer straight away and can offer appointments at just a few hours’ notice.

Curry on doctor: Dr Saha's eaterie, Darjeeling Heights, in Rainham, Kent

A doctor whose surgery has been condemned by patients and watchdogs moonlights at a curry house.

On Friday, Dr Bijan Saha was seen by  The Mail on Sunday dealing with takeaway orders at the Darjeeling Heights restaurant in Rainham, Kent, run by his wife Chhaya.

The 73-year-old took his post behind the counter soon after 8pm, after his NHS surgery closed for the weekend.

Patients have slammed the service provided at Lakeside Medical Practice in Sittingbourne, where he is the only GP.

One online review on NHS Choices warned: ‘Avoid it like the plague.’ Another stated: ‘This is a terrible surgery. The staff are rude and never answer the phone.’

Their concerns have been backed up  by England’s health watchdog, the Care Quality Commission, which recently declared his practice did not meet any of 11 key standards and was placing patients at ‘unacceptable risk’.

Dr Saha, who has decided to retire at the end of the month, declined to comment.

Dr Mark Bonar splits his time between an NHS surgery and at his Ultra Wellness Clinic in Harley Street, which charges £150 for a 15-minute appointment. He said he was ‘forced’ into the private work after his  NHS hours were reduced because of financial cuts.

Most GPs in England are partners, which means they also run the business side of their practices. Average earnings are £103,000.

Increasing numbers of England’s 35,000 family doctors are ‘salaried’, meaning they are paid by partners to work a set number of hours.

Out of hours: The doctor, who has decided to retire at the end of this month, began his shift at 8pm, just after his surgery closed for the weekend

Their average earnings are lower at £56,800 but their contracts leave them free to moonlight in the private sector, where pay is much higher. Dr Victoria Blackburn works weekdays in a NHS clinic in Stonehouse, Gloucestershire, where some patients have to wait three weeks to be seen.

But on Saturdays she works at the private Nuffield Health-run Cheltenham Hospital – which charges £95 for a consultation.

She said: ‘I am contracted to work seven sessions a week (35 hours) within the NHS. I frequently exceed these hours. I choose to spend my “spare” hours doing work including one session a week at Nuffield Health.’

Court out: Dr Allen attends to Sergiy Stakhovsky at Wimbledon in 2011, after he was hit by the serve of Jamie Murray

Patients of Dr Jane Allen will have to wait until next month as to see her – as she’s taking time off from Wimbledon Village Surgery to become the official ‘club doctor’ of the tennis tournament  on the clinic’s doorstep.

Dr Allen, 61, said she couldn’t comment on her ‘high-profile job’, adding: ‘It’s nobody’s business. I don’t think my patients are affected at all.

Anyway, you have no idea whether I’m on annual leave or working part time.’

Anonymous patients on the NHS Choices website, above, have slated her surgery for the ‘frustrating experience’ of booking an appointment.

Dr Bish Naha and Dr Naem Khan, who work at South London’s  Mitcham Medical Centre – rated as ‘absymal’ on the NHS Choices patients’ review website – also ply their trade at Wimbledon Private GP Clinic, which offers a 24-hour call-out service and charges £90 for a consultation.

Dr Naha said he had an NHS contract to work a set number of hours, but outside that he can take on other work. He added: ‘I wish I had funding for a weekend service for our NHS patients. We used to do so on Saturday mornings but funding was withdrawn.’ Three GPs who work  in the NHS also do shifts at the  Platinum Medical Centre, attached to the upmarket Wellington Hospital in St John’s Wood, North London.

One of them, Dr Selwyn Dexter, runs the North West London Medical Centre which has received a poor review from the Care Quality Commission watchdog.

NHS GP Mark Bonar charges his private patients £150 for a 15-minute appointment at the Ultra Wellness Clinic in  Harley Street.

But at the Connaught Square NHS Practice where he works, in Central London, waiting times can be up to three weeks, say patients on NHS Choices website.

Dr Bonar says he works 24 hours a week there, plus occasional weekends, and 20 hours a week privately.

He says he only sees a ‘handful’ of patients in private practice, adding:  ‘Patients at my NHS practice can always be seen the same day if it is urgent. Routine patients can sometimes have a wait, especially to see me personally, but this is not dissimilar to very many NHS practices.

Dr Claire Winstanley, a part-time NHS GP in Bristol who also sees paying patients at The Chesterfield private hospital, said doctors were turning to ad hoc private work because of the Government’s ‘unsettling’ overhaul of GP services.

She said: ‘ I don’t think doctors are skiving off to see private patients, but working extra hard in their spare time. Doctors would not put money before patients – but they still need an income.’ Although hospital consultants can also treat their NHS patients privately, and many do, GPs are not allowed to offer paid treatment to their NHS patients.

Dr Chaand Nagpaul of the British Medical Association, the doctors’ union, said there was little demand for private GP services in England.

Many patients seen privately are thought to be from overseas and ineligible for free NHS care. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter blamed the former Labour government for ‘botching’ the 2004 GP contract, saying: ‘It vandalised the relationship between patients and doctors as it allowed GPs to opt out of providing out-of-hours services.

‘Now we pay a premium to get GPs to do what they once did for free. What we want is to see GPs providing extended opening hours and extra appointments.’

Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said the Coalition must take responsibility as ‘patients will find these revelations hard to stomach’.

We know from our helpline, where we hear from patients on a daily basis about the issues they have trying to see their GP, that it’s almost impossible to get a same-day appointment, which results in many patients having to go to A&E.

Some patients tell us they have to wait four days and they face the frustration of having to ring the surgery every morning to see if there is an appointment.

No one knows when they’re  going to need to see a GP, so the services in primary care should  be available to the public when  the public needs them.

Shocked: Chief executive of the Patients Association Katherine Murphy says she receives hoards of complaints about waits of up to four days for appointments

Patients should have access to GP services 24/7 and the GP should be the first point of contact for anyone who requires healthcare.

It’s a vicious circle for patients – because of GPs’ non-availability at certain times, they’re not able to access the service.

It’s the responsibility of the commissioner that a safe service  is accessible and available to patients when they need it.

The vast majority of patients wouldn’t be able to exercise the choice of seeing their GP privately because they can’t afford to, and why should they have to pay to see their GP? They’re already paying for a health service that should be available when they need it.

Ultimately, the accountability lies with the NHS commissioners. They should make sure that there is a service in the community, and that if GPs have available time it should be used seeing NHS patients.

There is no continuity of care  out of hours, and this is the danger to patients when the service isn’t provided by their GP but by private contractors. This is because they have very little knowledge of local services and the history of the patient, which is obviously important if they have got long-term conditions.

We’ve been told by the Royal College of GPs that many GPs are retiring over the next couple of years. If we’re going to get the  NHS patient-centred, it is really important that the appropriate services are available to the public in the community, so that we stop people from turning up at A&E because it’s the only place with  the light always on.
