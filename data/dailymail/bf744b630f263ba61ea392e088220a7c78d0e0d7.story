It is a chore hated by millions of people the world over.

Now, a German firm has made a bizarre contraption it claims can dry and iron a shirt in just seven minutes.

It looks like something from outside a
second hand car garage, but this inflatable gadget is actually 'the 
world's first hands free iron'.

A bizarre £850 contraption to come out of Germany boasts that it can iron a shirt in seven minutes

Users fix their clothes over an inflatable bag which is then filled with hot air, forcing crumples and creases out of shirts and trousers.

The bizarre device is the result of world
famous German engineering - and its website describes it as 'probably 
the best in the world'.

However it comes at a price - the Tubie costs £850, around 30 times the price of a regular iron.

The online blurb reads: 'While it's doing the work, you can take care of more important matters or simply relax.

'It is the best solution for you, fast and perfect for the job!

'Thus, you can spare yourself from the cumbersome standing at the ironing table."

Carina Kraus, who manufactures the Tubie 
in a small factory near Munich, said: 'The advantages of the Tubie are 
clear - you can dry and iron at the same time.

'It works in a quite simple way using hot air to dry and iron clothing placed on either the shirt or trousers fixture.

'Many of our customers do this during watching TV or other work. It is just so easy once you have done it a few times.

'Our Tubie is bought by normal people who do not like the idea of ironing.

'Since the product is of the highest quality the price reflects this.'
