Thousands of passengers flying to and from Gatwick have had their flights delayed, cancelled or diverted after a dramatic emergency landing closed the airport's single runway.

The airport has descended into chaos after the Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747747 bound for Las Vegas and with more than 450 people on board was forced to return to London after developing a technical fault shortly after take-off.

It is believed almost 10,000 passengers travelling to and from Gatwick have had their flights disrupted.

Thousands of passengers flying to and from Gatwick have had their flights delayed, cancelled or diverted after a dramatic emergency landing closed the airport's single runway

Passengers from the stricken Virgin Atlantic Boeing 747 arrive at the Hilton Hotel, London Gatwick Airport where they are staying for the night ready to fly to Las Vegas tomorrow morning

Virgin said it would be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey

Gatwick is the world's busiest single-runway airport. It sees up to 900 departures and arrivals per day 

For several hours the jumbo jet circled the airport, dropping fuel before passengers were told to adopt the brace position for an emergency landing. 

The plane finally landed with only three quarters of its landing gear down after a set of wheels on the starboard wing refused to drop with holidaymakers praising the hero pilot for a 'text-book landing'.

But the runway was closed for three hours while emergency crews helped those on board off and engineers examined the craft. 

It was finally reopened again at 7.03pm. 

A Gatwick airport spokesman said: 'The airport is now facilitating inbound and outbound flights but it will take some time for normal service to resume. 

'We advise passengers to check with their airlines on the status of their flight. Updates will also be posted on the Gatwick website and on Twitter.

'We are working with our airline partners to provide food, drink and welfare facilities for those passengers whose flights may either have been delayed or cancelled. Gatwick staff and volunteers are being made available throughout the airport to offer passengers advice and the latest information.'

EasyJet, for which Gatwick is the biggest base, diverted 12 flights to other airports, including   Southend to Bristol. It also cancelled 34 departures and inbound flights, the Independent reports.

The runway was closed while the aircraft is removed. No flights were departing and inbound flights are being diverted to other airports

The jet was heading across the Atlantic when it turned back over Devon, left, and circled Gatwick several times

British Airways has so far cancelled 12 flights to and from Gatwick, arrivals were diverted to Bournemouth, Southampton while incoming flights from other European flights are being held on runways waiting for the Gatwick backlog to be cleared. 

Emergency services had been on standby as the giant aircraft, with 447 passengers and 15 crew aboard, came into land.

Describing the mood on the plane, Dan Crane, 24, from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, said it was 'anxious, a lot were worried, some crying. The mood was quiet and (we were) just waiting for the captain's next announcement.'

Mr Crane, who was with family and friends, said the crew kept everyone informed, adding: 'They said it was an emergency landing and we had to brace on impact.'

Mike Kaufman, speaking from his seat on the plane back at Gatwick, said: 'This was one of the greatest emergency landings in history. It was very smooth.'

He praised the pilots and the cabin crew, saying the landing had been 'textbook'.

Interviewed for Sky News, he went on: 'We didn't realise there would be such a fuss. It was such a calm experience. About half an hour out they said we would have to go back to Gatwick. They said it was a hydraulic problem.

'The fact everything went so well shows just how professional the flight crew were. The crew were calm. We had a safety briefing two hours before we landed and when we were told we would have to go into the brace position for landings a sigh went around the plane.'

Mr Kaufman told Sky News: 'Everybody gave the crew a big round of applause when we landed. I can't wait to get into the terminal and have a gin and tonic now.

'We were talking about going on a rollercoaster ride when we got to Las Vegas. Now I'm not so sure.'

A spokesman for British pilots' organisation Balpa said: 'Pilots train hard for exactly this kind of situation. It goes to show that well-trained pilots are vital.'

Dramatic photographs showed the jumbo jet landing with the right-side wing landing gear not deployed.

Virgin Atlantic chief executive Craig Kreeger said: 'I am very pleased to confirm that all customers and crew have now disembarked the VS43 flight to Las Vegas, which returned to Gatwick airport this afternoon following a problem with one of the landing gear.

'I understand that this will have been a very upsetting situation for the customers involved, and for their friends and family, and will have significantly disrupted people's holiday plans. We will make sure they are well looked after this evening, and will be operating a special flight tomorrow for everyone who would like to continue their journey.'

He went on: 'I'm here at Gatwick to meet our customers and crew, and to thank them all for their fantastic response. I understand that people have already been phoning our contact centre - from the plane - to make sure that they are booked on tomorrow's special flight to Las Vegas.

'I want to reassure them that we'll make sure there's a seat for everyone and we really look forward to making sure they're in Vegas for an amazing New Year's Eve.

'I would like to thank all of the Virgin Atlantic crew and colleagues, who responded with the absolute professionalism and care for our customers that we would expect.'
