A maintenance worker died after his clothes got caught in a bowling alley machine he was trying to repair, according to authorities.

David Geiger, 53, was working on a pinsetter machine at Northwest Lanes on Happy Valley Drive, Ohio at 2 p.m. when his clothes got caught on something and the machine pulled him to his death.

Dozens of customers were inside the bowling alley at the time but no one saw the accident take place.

It wasn’t until other employees paged the victim several times and didn’t get a response from him that they went looking for him and found him.

According to Fairfield police, Geiger had been sent to repair a machine that was having a problem. 

After he'd been back there for quite some time, staff tried to call him, and when he didn't answer the call they went back there and found him.

Co-workers said that Geiger had worked at the bowling alley for four years and lived in Southwest Ohio but not in Fairfield.  

Former co-worker, Nathan Hursell, told WCPO-TV that Geiger had been working in the bowling alley business for 30 years, including several years when they worked together.

He said Geiger was very familiar with the machines and knew exactly what he was doing, so his death was a 'freak accident.' 

Hursell, now the head mechanic at another bowling alley - Madison Bowl in Oakley - told WCPO-TV: 'The machines he maintained are are about 40-50 years old.

Family man: Geiger is pictured here with his family, a co-worker said he was 'married with a couple of kids'

Loss: Geiger was described as a 'stand up guy' who 'knew all about the machines he was working on

'They're good machines but just like any running machine they're dangerous -- they got gears, pulleys, everything's running back there.'

He added: 'He was real sociable, a real nice guy. He was married with a couple of kids.'

'I couldn't believe it I was shocked, you know, tragic moment for anybody, let alone him. Dave was a stand up guy.  

Butler County coroner will carry out an autopsy  on Friday   to determine an exact cause of death.

Police said it wasn’t clear if he had been strangled or crushed by the machinery. But preliminary investigations suggest his shirt became caught on the machine.

The owners of Northwest Lanes have declined to comment other than to say they were 'very sad and upset.' They also shut the business down on Thursday night.

An investigator from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration was sent.

But agency officials said they haven't had any previous investigations at the bowling alley, which has been operational since 1976. 

Meanwhile, Hursell said he is more concerned with safety than ever.

He said: 'Any call I run on a machine now [what happened to Dave] goes through my head.'

'He knew exactly what he was doing back there. It's one of those things where you don't think twice of that happening. It's just a common spot that we get in the machines at and it's just a freak accident.'
