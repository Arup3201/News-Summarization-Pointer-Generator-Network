The White House defended the freedom of speech and the press on Wednesday in a long-awaited response to an online petition to deport CNN host Piers Morgan over his views on gun control.

'Let’s not let arguments over the 
Constitution’s Second Amendment violate the spirit of its First,' White House Press Secretary wrote in a blog post attached to the petition, which had gathered more than 109,000 signatures by Wednesday.

'President Obama believes that the Second Amendment guarantees an
individual right to bear arms,' he continued. 'However, the Constitution not only 
guarantees an individual right to bear arms, but also enshrines the 
freedom of speech and the freedom of the press - fundamental principles 
that are essential to our democracy.'

Carney noted that the 
massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, which left 20 children and six adults 
dead, had 'sparked an intense, and at times emotional, national 
conversation about the steps we can take as a country to reduce gun 
violence.'

Morgan celebrated news of the response 
Wednesday by tweeting, 'BREAKING NEWS: President Obama has officially 
decided I am NOT being deported.'

Carney's response came after the petition, which was started on 
the White House website, had gathered more than four times the requirement to warrant an official 
response from the administration.

The petition was started in response to an
interview on Morgan's show in which he called Larry Pratt of Gun Owners
for America an 'idiot,' 'dangerous' and 'an unbelievably stupid man' 
after Pratt argued that more guns could reduce crime.

In another debate on gun controls, 
Morgan shouted down economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime
and branded him a liar for claiming gun crime trends in countries such 
as Britain supported his thesis.

The comments outraged gun owners across the U.S., who called for Morgan to be deported.

Launched on December 21 through a 
White House web tool called 'We the People,' the petition accuses Morgan
of engaging in a 'hostile attack against the U.S. Consitution' by 
targeting the Second Amendment and 'exploiting his position as a 
national network television host to stage attacks against the rights of 
American citizens.'

In Carney's post, he embedded a 
video in which President Obama talks about the need to 
tighten controls on guns.

'If we work harder to keep guns out 
of the hands of dangerous people, there would be fewer atrocities like 
the one in Newtown,' Obama says, 'or any of the lesser-known tragedies 
that visit small towns and big cities all across America every day.'
