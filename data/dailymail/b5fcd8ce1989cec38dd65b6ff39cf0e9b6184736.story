Heartbreak hits different people in different ways, but what if you could track the effect your latest break-up had on your spending habits, fitness levels and even sleep patterns?

That was the inspiration behind a new blog post called Quantified Breakup created by an New York-based interactive editor.

Following her divorce, Lam Thuy Vo tracked her bank statements, PayPal records, and G-chat message timestamps to reveal the true impact her divorce had on her life.

Lam Thuy Vo used data taken from bank statements and PayPal records to track her spending habits following her divorce. Each item category is colour coded. The size of the circles represents how much she spent and each item is located based on how 'useless' it is

Thuy Vo’s blog highlights an increasing trend for tracking everyday activities.

There are now gadgets that track the 
amount of steps people take, how many calories they burn, what they eat 
and how much they sleep, among others. 

For the past six years, 
Washington-based data analyser Robby MacDonnell has been tracking his 
productivity using similar devices, including how much he much time he 
spends on his computer, and how much he uses his phone.

He discovered that over that period he’s spent 8,300 hours in front of a screen, which works out at over one day a week - 26 hours.

For one of these months, diabetic 
MacDonnell also plotted his blood sugar levels as part of a different 
tracking experiment and discovered they dropped significantly around 
midnight.

She then plotted this data into infographics, charts and animations.

According to her blog, Thuy Vo said: ‘Divorce is hard. Putting this process into numbers, images and data visualisations is helpful.

'It yanks me out of these all-consuming moments of sadness and helps me understand how, perhaps as time passes, things are going to be ok.'

She began by tracking her sleeping patterns using the timestamps on her G-chat messages.

She was able to track when she was awake, and asleep, based on when these emails were sent and notes were made.

For three months she plotted each hour onto a graph that shows she woke fairly regularly in the middle of the night between the second and sixth weeks following the break-up, and then once again in week eleven.

Thuy Vo admitted she switched between ‘insomina and exhaustion’ but took positives from the fact her sleeping became steady as the months passed.

She then tracked her exercise. Thuy Vo said she felt the urge to get fit and compared it to the way fictional character Forrest Gump reacts when Jenny leaves him in the 1994 film of the same name.

Thuy Vo plotted runs, bike rides and subway journeys she made in Coney Island and turned this data into animations.

Elsewhere, she was also able to track how much money she spent on retail therapy over the first three months she was single - as well as exactly what that money was spent on.

Each item on the chart is colour coded, based on whether it is clothing, items for her home or random purchases.

The size of the circles represents how much she spent on each item and Thuy Vo additionally added how ‘useless’ the items she bought were.

Highlights include a ‘stupidly expensive fountain pen’, as well as a synthesizer midi keyboard. She also bought a bowl shaped like a pig. 

A second infographic showed each of the items that she didn’t ‘necessarily need’.

For this data set, Thuy Vo studied bank statements, Paypal records and her purchase history from sites including Amazon.

To track her post break-up sleeping patterns, Thuy Vo used timestamps on emails and calendar notes. For three months she plotted each hour onto a graph, pictured, that shows she woke fairly regularly in the middle of the night between the second and sixth weeks following the breakup, and then once again in week eleven

‘It’s astonishing just how much I rely on plastic and logins to make payments. Astonishing. And perhaps just a wee bit scary.’ She continued it was ‘pretty ridiculous how much money I’ve wasted.’
