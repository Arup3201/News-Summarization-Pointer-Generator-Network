The elderly German recluse who was found to have a hoard of art looted by the Nazis worth close to a billion pounds has owned up to having a second stash of masterpieces.

Picassos, Renoirs and Monets are among the 60 additional works found at the second home of Cornelius Gurlitt in Salzburg, Austria.

They are estimated by experts to be worth over £100million pounds - but it remains unclear if Gurlitt's father, an art expert who worked for Hitler, stole them or acquired them legally.

Hidden treasures: Cornelius Gurlitt's house in Salzburg, Austria, where 60 works including Picassos, Renoirs and Monets have been found after he told investigators in Germany they were there to stop them being stolem

Gurlitt, 80, became internationally infamous in November last year when customs officials revealed they had seized 1,406 lost masterpieces that staggered the art world from his Munich apartment. 

His father Hildebrand was exposed as personal adviser to Hitler - acquiring paintings for a museum the Nazi leader planned to build in Linz after the war and selling the modern art the Fuehrer detested to raise money for weapons.

The first stash has been proven to include several hundred paintings that were either looted from Jewish collectors or purchased from them at knock-down prices so the owners could buy expensive exit visas to escape Germany.

One rare Chagall masterpiece was looted from a Jewish family by the Gestapo in 1941. Savely Blumenstein, whose collection also included Picassos and Pissaros, was seized in Riga, Latvia, when the German marched in.

He was able to escape to America and in 1981 the West German government paid him less than £15,000 compensation for the painting called 'Allegorical Scene', which experts say would sell today for more than £1million at auction.

At the end of the war 'Monuments Men' - the American army's art sleuths - quizzed Hildebrand Gurlitt on suspicion of criminal art dealing on Hitler's behalf, but he was never charged.

He bequeathed his collection to his son who sold objects piecemeal down the years to live from the proceeds.

After the Gurlitt haul was seized investigators said they doubted he had any other additional artworks.  But his home in Austria - he acquired Austrian citizenship sometime in the Sixties - was only searched on Monday.

According to the authorities the premises were searched and the paintings taken away at Gurlitt's request as "a precaution against break-ins and theft." 

A spokesman for Gurlitt, who is demanding the return of the bulk of the collection, said he has authorised an expert evaluation of the Salzburg paintings to ensure they are "not looted Nazi art," but believed them not to be.

A spokesman for German prosecutors handling the Gurlitt art haul said they had no comment on this claim adding: "We have taken note of this but have nothing further to add."

Gurlitt's fabulous collection was only discovered because he was stopped on a train.
