The first major snowstorms of winter have dumped more than a foot of snow across parts of the Midwest, freezing hundreds of students out of their school classes and causing chaos on the roads.

More than 500 crashes were reported Monday, as the worst-hit parts of states including Minnesota, Wisconsin and the Dakotas were coated with up to 16 inches of snow.

It came as cold winds swept south over Colorado and Texas, sending temperatures plummeting by as much as 50 degrees in a few hours.

The cold weather is part of a phenomenon known as the Omega Block, in which unusual weather patterns warp the jet stream and drag hot and cold air thousands of miles from where they would usually be.

School chaos: Students across affected states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin were told to stay home from class Monday and Tuesday. But these kids, in St Paul, Minnesota, braved the winter snows on foot

Danger on the roads: Some 500 car crashes were reported in just Minnesota. This pick-up truck rolled over on the I-94 near Alexandria, Minnesota

Jackknife: This truck crashed on the US-63 route near Cumberland, Wisconsin. The Department for Transportation in the state reported visibility of less than 100 yards in some places

Colds to come: Snow will keep falling across the country, as temperatures tumble

Phenomenon: The cold weather is being brought in the the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, above in purple, which has dragged warmed air (in red) up and pushed cold air down. The pattern is known as an 'Omega Block' because the boundaries between hot and cold (in yellow above) look like a Greek letter omega

The epicenter of the phenomenon is the remnants of Typhoon Nuri, which is causing areas of exceptionally low pressure over the Bering Sea, between Russia and Alaska.

This has bent the jet stream, a barrier of wind which usually keeps hot and cold air separate, pulling warm air north and pushing cold air south.

The pattern of pressures forms a bulge that resembles the Greek letter omega (Ω), and is therefore referred to as an Omega Block.

Cold air which would usually sits near Canada has been pulled down as far as Texas, while warmer air from around the United States sails north. As the front approached, temperatures in Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri plunged from the 70s into the teens in a matter of hours.

In Colorado, a huge dust storm accompanied the advancing front, and was pictured from above by an airplane passenger. 

The same phenomenon is warming up Alaska, with the result that, later this week, even the north of the region could be warmer than Dallas or Atlanta.

The most visible effect of the cold air is over the Midwest, where snowstorms have pummeled Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, causing widespread chaos. 

Roads became treacherous and schools districts threw in the towel amid the flurries of snow, with dozens closing and scores more starting late today. 

In central Minnesota, Cambridge and St Augusta reported 16.5 inches of snow, while 15 fell in Starbuck and 13 in Kimball.

Webster in northwest Wisconsin had 11 inches, upper Michigan had 9 and parts of North Dakota 8.

Towards the Rockies, conditions were equally severe, with 14 inches of snow reported to the northwest of Montana. Colorado was also caught up in the storms, which are expected to keep coming and dump as much as 2 feet of snow in places.

Drivers struggled to cope with the first blasts of wintry weather - in Minnesota alone 475 full crashes were reported yesterday, with 702 vehicles spinning out or ending up off the road.

Overturned: A semi carrying live turkeys skidded off the road and landed upside-down on the side of the I-94 near Dalton, Minnesota. The driver was not badly hurt

Heavy shifting: Snow plows were put to work on the streets of Minneapolis

The crashes resulted in 45 injuries - and one was fatal. In one incident, State Troopers had pulled over to help a jackknifed truck when a second truck slammed into them.

Tuesday morning the Minnesota and Wisconsin departments of transport were reporting that huge swathes of their state still had dangerous, snow-covered roads, and were advising travelers to stay home.

Students at schools across the states also got the call to stay home as many of their schools decided to close - though some unlucky students in St Cloud, Minnesota, took classes via the internet from their homes, KROCam.com reported.

Terri Sommerfeld, a clerk at the Ace Hardware store in Webster, Wisconsin, said snow blowers are flying off the shelves.

They usually sell six or seven of the machines each winter - but have sold that many in the last two days.

'It hasn't been overly busy today, but the ones that are coming are buying snow blowers and shovels,' she said.

Winter is officially still more than a month away, but it may not feel like it. The cold air coming with the snow will be around for a while, said Joe Calderone, a senior forecaster for the National Weather Service.

Further south, temperatures plunged by as much as 50 degrees in a matter of hours as the arctic front pushed down.

In the Texas Panhandle, cold swept temperatures in the 70s down to the high teens. Similar balmy weather in Missouri was replaced by temperatures in the 20s - dropping some 40 degrees overnight - along with a light dusting of snow.

In parts of Colorado, temperatures fell into the teens - about 20 to 30 degrees below normal - and they're expected to remain through Thursday.

Traffic: The I-35 freeway was held up while drivers took were challenged by the snowfall

In Minneapolis, even the first inch of snow tripled drive times. At one point, the weather turned to sleet, and tiny pellets stung uncovered faces and hands. Crews were plowing, shoveling or brushing off sidewalks, and snowplows did several loops around city streets.

Even Christmas decorator Richard Anderson complained about the early snow.

He said: 'As a professional holiday decorator you'd think I'd appreciate it. But I appreciate it when I'm all finished, and I'm finally sitting down and enjoying my own Christmas tree.'

'It's wet, cold, sticks to you. It's freezing on your jacket as it's raining. What do you call it? Rain, sleet and snow. And it's bitter. It's really bitter. It's not very nice.'

'It's part of being in South Dakota,' said Nancy Miller, a manager at Mid-America Travel Plaza in Belle Fourche. 'It's just the topic of the day. It's the first snowstorm of the season.'

In Chicago, some people were savoring breezy but mild weather near 60 before freezing temperatures arrive Wednesday.

'I just wanted to enjoy one of the last nice days,' said 44-year-old Joe Kauda, who lives in the Chicago suburb of Carol Stream and works in the mortgage industry. 

The wintry blast stirred fears of a repeat of last year's bitter season, when air from the polar vortex froze huge swathes of the country.

But the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration does not expect a repeat, and is predicting an average winter. 

This week's storm is part of a powerful system being pushed in by the remnants of Typhoon Nuri that hit Alaska's sparsely populated Aleutian Islands.
