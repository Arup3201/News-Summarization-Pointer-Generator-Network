An eight-year-old boy has been diagnosed with an incredibly rare genetic disorder which makes him look 'pregnant'. 

Aadam Asif is one of only 17 people in the UK to suffer from Niemann-Pick, Type B, which causes an enlarged liver and spleen.

He was born with the condition, which caused his stomach to protrude, but doctors only discovered he had the disease last year.

Aadam Asif, eight, has a rare genetic condition called Niemann-Pick, Type B, that causes his spleen and liver to be enlarged. He is also small for his age, bruises easily and lacks strength

Tragically, there is no cure for the disease and Aadam is not expected to live to see adulthood.

His devastated father Mohammed, 36, had no idea he and his ex-wife were both carriers of the Niemann-Pick gene.

Mr Asif, from Moseley, Birmingham, said: 'He has always had a slight belly but whenever we took him to the GP he said it was fine and nothing to worry about.

'Over the years his stomach has swelled which has given him the appearance of looking pregnant.

'When he started school I was determined to get answers. His tummy felt quite solid to touch.

'It was a little pot belly but we now know this was caused by an enlarged liver and spleen.

'Aadam was also very small in size, the smallest in his class and he didn’t have the strength that other kids have.

'His breathing was heavy too.

'He was getting bruised very easily. I gave him a bath and he had a bruise on his arm after just washing.

'His co-ordination wasn’t what it should be for a boy of his age.'

Mr Asif added: 'He finds the rough and tumble at school very difficult and he is very fearful.

'He has the innocence of a five-year-old, although he is eight.

'He is very self-disciplined and enthusiastic about life. It is good to see him getting up early and getting ready for the day.

Aadam's devastated father Mohammed, 36, had no idea he and his ex-wife were both carriers of the Niemann-Pick gene

'He is full of life and he won’t let anything hold him back.'

Aadam was finally diagnosed with the disease when he was referred to Birmingham Children’s Hospital for blood tests and X-rays.

Mr Asif, a part-time lorry driver who also has a daughter Alina, 10, who does not have the condition, said: 'When you are told that devastating news it doesn’t hit you straight away.

'It is such a shock. Aadam was seven-years-old by the time of his diagnosis and by then it was more noticeable that there was something wrong with him.

'I had no idea myself or my ex-wife were carriers until last year when Aadam was diagnosed with the disease.

'There is no treatment and no cure - you just have to manage the condition and look after him.

'He is aware he has something wrong with him but he is so brave and is always smiling. I am incredibly proud of him.

'As he gets older the condition will have a greater impact on his lungs and they could get clogged.

Mr Asif said: 'He is aware he has something wrong with him but he is so brave and is always smiling. I am incredibly proud of him'

'We don’t know what his life expectancy is but I am determined to give him the best life possible.'

Mr Asif is now raising money for the charity Jeans for Genes.

Jackie Imrie, clinical nurse practitioner specialising in Niemann-Pick, said: 'There is hope for the future as we have just started a three clinical trial involving adult patients.

'The trial involves replacing an enzyme which causes the swelling of the liver and spleen into the blood via a drip every two weeks.

'Hopefully this will produce positive results for the future.'

Niemann-Pick, Type B is an inherited condition which affects lipid metabolism.

People with the condition suffer a build up of lipids in the spleen, liver, lungs, bone marrow and brain.

Signs include an enlarged liver and spleen, slow growth and problems with lung function.

Suffers also often have blood abnormalities such as elevated cholesterol levels and low platelet levels.

The condition is caused by mutations in the SMPD1 gene.

There is no cure and treatments are only able to manage the symptoms.

Many people with the condition survive into their teens or even early adulthood.
