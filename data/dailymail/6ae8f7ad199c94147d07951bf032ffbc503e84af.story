These photos bring a whole new appreciation for the night sky as a photographer manages to capture the colour and movement of the stars.

A range of colours - including yellows, blues, oranges, pinks and turquoises - can all be seen illuminating the sky in locations around the world.

The colours are a result of the different surface temperatures of the stars with cooler stars appearing more red and hotter stars being blue.

Photographer Lincoln Harris used two different techniques to capture the stars in two ways - with some images looking like a celestial explosion while the others look like a colourful pinwheel.

The 40-year-old said: 'Both of those image types are achieved by turning the zoom ring on the lens during the exposure.

'The exploding photos are done with a 30 second exposure with a fast zoom, and the spirals are taken over a few hours with a very slow zoom.

'I set up the camera and use a programmable remote to automate the shoot.

'I usually take between 600 and 1,200 x 40 second exposures, which are later stacked using Photoshop.

'The coloured trails are due to the different surface temperatures of the stars.

'The colour pallete can also be changed by altering the white balance of the camera.'

These photos were taken in various locations in Australia and and the USA, including Yosemite National Park, California, USA, Lake Tahoe, Nevada, USA and Cape Woomalai, Phillip Island, Australia and Sutton Grange, Victoria, Australia.

Yosemite National Park in California, with its stunning scenery, provides a perfect base for Mr Harris' work

Mr Harris, from Bendigo, Australia, was able to capture the incredible photos with just his camera, a zoom lens - and a lot of patience.

He said: 'I usually have a pretty good idea of what I'll end up with when I start shooting the sky.

'I travel to the locations to take the photos, and I stay as long as I need to until I get the shot I want.

'To be honest, I usually get quite bored waiting for them to finish.'
