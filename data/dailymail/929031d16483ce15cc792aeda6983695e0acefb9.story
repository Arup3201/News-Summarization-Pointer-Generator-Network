An Ohio man who spent nearly four decades in prison after being convicted of murder will likely be freed Friday after a witness confessed he lied as a boy when he told jurors he saw the deadly attack.

Ricky Jackson had been seeking a new trial and sobbed loudly with his face in his hands as prosecutors dismissed his case Tuesday, The Plain Dealer reported.

'I can't believe this is over,' Jackson, 57, said, thanking his supporters and his attorneys from the Ohio Innocence Project, according to the newspaper. 

Jackson was serving a life sentence for aggravated murder and other charges, according to state prison records. He is expected to be released as soon as the paperwork is finished, the newspaper reported.

Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Timothy McGinty said the case fell apart after witness Eddie Vernon recanted, The Plain Dealer reported, saying that Vernon said he had been fed details of the crime by police and kept quiet about his lies because investigators had threatened to imprison his parents.

Vernon was 12 when he accused Jackson and two brothers in the May 1975 killing of a money-order collector who authorities said was beaten, shot and attacked with acid as he walked near a grocery store, and no evidence connected the defendants to the crime, but all three were convicted by juries, the newspaper reported.

A lengthy investigative piece from Cleveland Scene in 2011, called 'What the Boy Saw,' looked into Vernon's earlier testimony, the paper noted.

Vernon told the judge he was trying to please others when he provided a false story based on information from a friend and police who fed him details, creating lies that helped convict the three men, and he said he gave authorities the names of the three men because he thought he was doing the right thing.The Plain Dealer reported

'All the information was fed to me,' said Vernon, who presented himself to change his story after speaking with a pastor, the news outlet reported. 'I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime.'

He also said he had been nearby on a bus when he heard two pops, but couldn't see what occurred - though others who were on the bus had testified that Vernon wasn't in position to see the slaying. 

No evidence connected Jackson and his two fellow defendants to the crime, but all three were convicted by juries

Prosecutors had been doubtful of Vernon but acknowledged after the hearing that the case didn't hold up, the newspaper reported, with Judge Richard McMonagle telling McGinty, 'You made the right choice.' 

Attorneys for the two convicted brothers, Wiley and Ronnie Bridgeman, also sought a new trial based on Vernon's information and are expected to ask prosecutors to drop that case, too. 

Ronnie Bridgeman spent more than 25 years in prison, and his brother remains incarcerated.
