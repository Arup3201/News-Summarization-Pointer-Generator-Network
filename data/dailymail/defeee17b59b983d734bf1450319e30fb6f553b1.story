IT businessman Matthew Munson has paid £43,000 for a flight across the Atlantic. Of course it's no ordinary flight, but a historic journey from Canada to the UK aboard an Avro Lancaster Bomber.

The Henley-on-Thames entrepreneur won the bidding war on eBay for the honour put up for grabs by the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum in Hamilton, Ontario, that will help finance a month-long commemorative tour next month.

Munson, 34, will be part of an eight-strong crew manning the plane on part of its tour, starting with the flight from its base in Ontario to RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire.

Final flight: Munson will be on-board as this Lancaster makes its last journey from Canada to the UK

Ebay auction: The Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum began bidding at $42,766 Canadian dollars (£25,000)

History buff's dream: The 3,700-mile flight will take four days

Munson said his winning bid was actually lower than the limit he'd set himself.

'I wasn’t sure if it was genuine at first but thought I’d give it a go,' he said.

'The
 bidding was at $79,000 (Canadian dollars) and I’d set myself a limit of
 $83,000 so I entered that amount but then got a message from eBay 
saying they needed to verify the bid because it was such a large amount 
of money. I put in a final bid of $79,100 just two minutes before it 
closed and was a bit stunned when I got a call from the museum in Canada
 a few minutes later to say I’d won!'

Munson's
 3,700 mile journey over four days, sponsored by Thwaites, the brewers 
of Lancaster Bomber ale, will include en-route stops at Goose Bay, 
Canada and Keflavik, Iceland.

'I
 love all things mechanical whether it’s planes, trains or cars,' he 
said. 'As long as it has an engine I’m interested. The history that 
comes with the Lancaster Bomber is amazing and I feel very privileged to
 be a part of the tour. It’s not going to be a comfortable journey – 
probably very cold and we’ll be flying for six hours a day, but I can’t 
deny it’s a dream come true.' 

Enthusiast: Munson is passionate about anything with a motor and considers it a privilege to make this trip

Famous flyer: The Lancaster is among the most recognisable aircraft from the Second World War

When
 the Canada bomber arrives in the UK it will be united with the only 
other airworthy Lancaster Bomber left in the world which is owned by 
Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.

The pair will take to the skies together in a never to be seen again event.

Canadian
 Warplane Heritage Museum’s CEO, David Rohrer, said: 'We’re thrilled 
that Matthew will be joining us on this incredible journey – we can’t 
promise him a luxurious flight and whilst we won’t be able to offer any 
in-flight movies, there will be an incredible one going on outside!'

As stated on the online auction site before the final bid, Munson will be 'trained to operate as a crew member on the last flight of a Canadian built 
Lancaster aircraft from Canada to England in August 2014. 

'Maximum crew member weight is 250lbs and you must be able to climb a ladder and maneuver in tight places,' it specified.

The journey will also be filmed as part of a documentary.

The Avro Lancaster is one of the Second World War's most-recognisable British aircraft.

It
 is most famous for its involvement in the Dambuster raids, which saw 19
 Lancasters attack German dams with Sir Barnes Wallis's 'bouncing bombs'
 in 1943.

The
 plane was acquired by Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum - which 
features the aircraft used by Canada from World War II until today - in 
1978, when it underwent a 10-year restoration, and has remained 
airworthy since 1988.

Flight with a view: The Lancaster will be flying at below 10,000ft as the cabin isn't pressurised

Tight fit: The winning bidder had to be willing to move around in tight spaces

Honoured: Andrew Mynarski was the last Canadian airman to be awarded the Victoria Cross in the Second World War

'Probably the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War, the Avro Lancaster had impressive flying characteristics and operational performance,' the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum says on its website.

The winner will be flying in the Canadian Warplane Heritage Museum's Lancaster Mk X, which was built at Victory Aircraft, Malton, Canada, in July 1945.

The plane is dedicated to the memory of Pilot Officer Andrew Mynarski who was awarded the Victoria Cross - the highest award for bravery in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

Canadian Mynarski won the award on June 13, 1944, when his Lancaster was shot down in flames by a German night fighter during the Second World War.

As the bomber fell, Mynarski managed to free the tail gunner trapped in the rear turret of the blazing and out-of-control aircraft before he died.

The crew member survived and lived to
 tell the tale, resulting in the Victoria Cross being awarded in 1946 - 
the last such award to a Canadian airman in the Second World War.

The
 Lancaster bomber, which is flying to the UK in August, was dedicated to
 Mynarski, and is referred to as the 'Mynarski Memorial Lancaster'.

It is painted in the colours of his aircraft KB726 – VR-A, which flew with RCAF Squadron.

Unique opportunity: The passengers will fly alongside the most famous Allied bomber of the Second World War

In
 1952, it suffered a serious accident and received a replacement wing 
centre section from a Lancaster that had flown in combat over Germany.

It served as a maritime patrol aircraft in Newfoundland for many years and was retired from the RCAF in late 1963.

With help from the Sulley Foundation in 1977, it was acquired from the Royal Canadian Legion in Goderich, Ontario, where it had been on outside display.

Eleven years passed before it was completely restored and flew again on September 24, 1988.
