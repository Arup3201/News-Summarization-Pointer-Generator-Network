It's rare enough to fall pregnant aged 64... for it to be twins is even rarer.

And in China it is even rarer still to be allowed to keep your twins thanks to a one-child policy that's been in force since the 1970s.

But Sheng Hailin managed to achieve all three when she became China's oldest mother four years ago giving birth to daughters Zhizhi and Huihui aged 60.

Sheng and her husband decided that
 she wanted to become a mother again after her daughter, 29, was killed 
by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2009.

Happy family: Sheng Hailin became China's oldest mother when she gave birth to twins Zhizhi and Huihui when she was 60. Four years on she says she couldn't be happier

Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from loneliness.'

So, in a rare move for the country which enforces a one-child policy, a military hospital in Heifei agreed to give Mrs Hailin and her husband IVF treatment.

And in 2010 she gave birth to Zhizhi and Huihui. They are now aged three.

Following their birth, Sheng has returned to work as a medical worker giving health lectures and also spends more than 10,000 Yuan (£949) a month on two helpers because she is no longer able to undertake some physical tasks of looking after the children, such as bathing.

Young at heart: Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from loneliness'

She says: 'For the baby girls, I have given out all I have?'

The mother, who works as a health lecturer, added: 'Some lectures may only last one day, but sometimes I have to stay three or four days in one place.

'I could only spend four or five days at home with my children in a month. I'm 64 now and my body is old.'

In November last year, the Chinese government announced couples could have two children if one parent is an only child.

An estimated one million families in the country have lost their sole descendant since the one child policy took effect in the late 1970s, and another four to seven million are expected to do so in the next 20 to 30 years.

Such families face uncertain futures, with no one to help them through old age in a country which emphasises family life.

Rajo Devi Lohan, from India, is currently the world's oldest mother after giving birth to a daughter through IVF in 2008 at the age of 69.
