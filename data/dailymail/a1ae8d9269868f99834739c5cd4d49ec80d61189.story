President Obama came out swinging at Republicans on Monday night during a high-dollar fundraiser for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in Maryland, saying their concerns about the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and his Obamacare medical insurance law were 'not serious.'

His latest antagonistic salvo will enrage the GOP, as it brings to mind his July 2013 pronouncement that the fast-brewing controversies engulfing his presidency were 'phony scandals.'

Obama never specific which scandals were 'phony' during a Galesburg, Illinois speech about economic issues.

But at the time a quartet of all-hands-on-deck crises were swirling around the West Wing: the National Security Agency's publicly leaked surveillance programs, the Internal revenue Service's targeting of conservative groups, his Justice Department's seizure of reporters' phone records and emails, and the Benghazi attack that killed four Americans.

On Monday, he played to a sympathetic crowd of about 65 people who paid up to $32,400 per couple to dine with the president at the home of a wealthy supporter in the tony Washington, D.C. suburb of Potomac, Maryland.

The new 'phony scandals' spin: On Monday night Obama, shown May 14 making the case for infrastructure spending, called concerns about the 2012 Benghazi terror attack and his Obamacare medical insurance law 'not serious'

'Not serious': The U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, LIbya erupted in flames on September 11, 2012 after heavily armed terrorists linked to an al-Qaeda affiliate group launched mortars and grenades and followed up with small-arms fire

Pointing a finger at Republicans, he lobbed rhetorical grenades in the hope of firing up his base for the coming November congressional election.

'Yes, we could reform government and streamline it, and update it so that it is capable to meet the concerns of the 21st century and it can be more customer-friendly,' he said during a 15-minute speech.

'And yes, we do have to worry about issues like long-term debt – although the primary source of long-term debt is health care costs, and if we can help drive those down we’ll be just fine.'

'But that’s not the debate that’s taking place right now,' Obama continued, blaming the GOP for focusing on his administration's apparent shortcomings.

'The debate we’re having right now is about, what – Benghazi? Obamacare?' an incredulous Obama asked, according to a White House transcript.

'And it becomes this endless loop. It's not serious. It's not speaking to the real concerns that people have.'

A Politico/GfK poll published Monday indicates that those concerns are split.

The survey found that the economy is the most often cited national issue that concerns voters the most, with 26 per cent of Americans choosing it from a list of 13 hot-button topics.

But when those who expressed negative opinions about government were asked what brought the worst impact to members of their immediate family, more cited health care and taxes than all other issues combined.

The Politico poll did not include any questions about Benghazi.

'Not serious': White House Press Secretary Jay Carney has been fending off questions about Obamacare since its disastrous launch in October

The
 poll did show, however, that Obama's job-performance approval ratings 
are significantly under water, making his coattails shorter than ever as
 November approaches.

Fully 
59 per cent of those surveyed said they disapprove of the president's 
job performance, including 41 per cent who said they 'strongly 
disapprove.'

Forty per cent approved of his performance in office, with the 'strongly approve' option chosen by just 15 per cent.

Obama
 insisted Monday night that while Republicans – particularly tea party 
conservatives – are obstructing his agenda, Democrats are behaving like 
sober post-partisans.

'We've
 got one party in Congress right now that has been captured by 
ideologues whose core premise is "no," he said, 'who fundamentally 
believe that the problem is government ... and whose principal focus at 
any given point in the day is trying to figure out how can they make 
people sufficiently cynical, sufficiently angry, sufficiently suspicious
 that they can win the next election. 

'I hate to be blunt about it, but that’s the play,' Obama fumed.

Republicans are generally expected to outperform Democrats in the coming midterms, needing a pickup of six Senate seats to control both chambers of Congress for the first time since 2006.

No prognosticator of national significance has predicted that Democrats can retake the House of Representatives, with most citing Obamacare as their main stumbling block.

The president spoke to wealthy partisans in one of the richest suburbs of Washington, D.C., blasting Republicans for not joining with his priorities

@highlight

The GOP has been 'captured' by the tea party, he suggested

@highlight

The result is a GOP that obstructs his agenda with scandals, including the 2012 terror attack in Libya and his medical insurance overhaul law

The comments bring to mind his 2013 salvo in which he called crisis in the IRS, the DOJ and the State Department 'phony scandals'
