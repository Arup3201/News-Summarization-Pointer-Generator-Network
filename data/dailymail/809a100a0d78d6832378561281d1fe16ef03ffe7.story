A mother who was repeatedly raped from the age of ten by her father and gave birth to his baby has won a £160,000 payout after a council admitted a breach of duty.

The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said social services failed to protect her from her father during a seven year period of abuse.

Now Bradford Council in West Yorkshire have admitted a breach of duty after failing to remove her from the family home and awarded her compensation.

A young woman, who was repeatedly raped by her father from the age of 10 and gave birth to his baby, has been awarded a £160,000 pay out from Bradford Council (file pic posed by model) 

The case came to light after the father was jailed for 19 years at Bradford Crown Court in 2012 when he was convicted by a jury of eight sample charges of rape and two of child cruelty relating to his two daughters.

The court heard how he fathered three children by them, and would hit them with a leather belt, a slipper and a cricket bat - offering them the choice of being hurt or having sex with him.

The judge described him as a 'cruel, violent, controlling and manipulative' sexual offender, who had shown little, if any, remorse for the harm he had caused.

His daughter, who is now 25 and won damages from the local authority explained: ' I love my son, but it's so hard to bond with him properly.

'Every time I look at him I see my dad. It makes parenting harder.

'I wouldn't change his being here, but I am totally torn by my feelings. I just wish he had another father.'

The abuse began in 1999, when the woman was ten and within days she was being assaulted three times a week while her mother was out at work.

After three years she told her mother, but she did not believe her.

The following year she stopped a police community support officer on the street and told them about the abuse.

She was placed under a protection order, and went to live at a children’s home.

Her father was charged with rape, but he was found not guilty and she returned to the family home.

Within weeks she was allowed to move back there and her father made her apologise in front of the family.

'He made me say I had made up wicked lies. I did it because I was scared,' she added.

She then became pregnant by her father and had an abortion, but 12 days later she was taken off the child protection register.

Five weeks later she told a social worker her father was abusing her again, but the worker reported no further investigation could take place because he had been found not guilty.

In five months, social workers visited the family home eight times, but failed to take the girl out of the house. Her case was then closed.

The woman, whose identity is protected by law, said: 'I couldn’t believe they’d closed my case. I felt let down again and totally trapped.'

She fell pregnant by her father a year later but convinced herself the baby was her boyfriend’s.

But DNA  revealed the real father four years later after police began investigating.

She explained: 'When my boy was born I cradled him and saw our life together as a fresh start. But Dad has poisoned that too.'

Asked about the payout, she said she was happy but added: 'It was never about the money.'

Julie Jenkins, Bradford Council’s assistant director of children’s specialist services, said: “The Council is aware of this young woman’s circumstances and she has accepted damages of £160,000.'
