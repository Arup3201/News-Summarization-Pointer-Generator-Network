David Hockney’s ex-lover has escaped drugs charges in relation to the death of a 23-year-old studio assistant at the artist’s seaside mansion.

John Fitzherbert, 48, was involved in a 24-hour drink and drugs binge with studio assistant Dominic Elliott before he was rushed to hospital and died from swallowing toxic toilet cleaner.

An inquest heard how both men ‘partied’ through the night, taking cocaine, Ecstasy and smoking cannabis, before falling asleep in each other’s arms, down the corridor from where Mr Hockney was asleep.

Shortly after Mr Elliott died, Mr Fitzherbert phoned another employee sharing the artist’s house and told him to clear his bedroom of evidence of drug use to avoid ‘adverse publicity’.

Details of the apparent ‘cover up’ were revealed at the inquest last August but police decided not to pursue the matter.

However, it emerged that Mr Fitzherbert and a 23-year-old man, who has not been identified, were arrested in connection with ‘drugs offences’ surrounding the tragedy.

They were released on bail pending further inquiries by Humberside Police, but the investigation has now ended without anyone being charged.

A police spokesman said: ‘The two men arrested on suspicion of drug offences have been unconditionally released.’ Police refused to reveal whether or not a file was sent to the Crown Prosecution Service.

The decision - revealed almost a year after Mr Elliott’s shocking death last March - means there will be no legal repercussions from the tragedy, despite revelations of drug-taking and admissions of a ‘cover-up’ to hide evidence.

Mr Hockney has left his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, and has moved back to his base in Los Angeles.

His spokesman said yesterday that he did not wish to comment. Mr Fitzherbert could not be contacted for a comment.

Mr Fitzherbert previously had a 24-year relationship with the multimillionaire artist. They remained friends despite splitting up five years ago and Mr Fitzherbert continued to live in and run the five-bedroom house in Bridlington.

He then developed a relationship with Mr Elliott, who became an assistant to the artist after dropping out of university.

Mr Fitzherbert said that Mr Elliott came to see him on the night before his death. He was upset about his exclusion from a Vanity Fair photo shoot of Mr Hockney and his team by the leading photographer Annie Leibovitz.

The two men spent the night alone together in Mr Hockney’s house drinking and taking drugs, with Mr Elliott snorting cocaine. The following day they were in bed when they heard Mr Hockney leave the house. Mr Fitzherbert said Mr Elliott was ‘laughing hysterically’ and leapt out of bed before throwing himself off an internal balcony.

Mr Elliott could not explain his behaviour but Mr Fitzherbert said he was ‘prone to random behaviour’ when drunk. They smoked more cannabis but spent most of the day sleeping until Mr Elliott asked to go to hospital.

An open bottle of lavatory cleaner - which was 95 per cent sulphuric acid - was found in the bathroom sink.

Mr Elliott had a significant quantity of Ecstasy in his system when he died.

Yesterday, one family friend of Mr Elliott, who asked not to be named, said she was ‘angry’ about the decision not to press charges.

She said: ‘It’s unfair. We all know who is to blame. The justice system is disgusting.’

Mr Elliott’s mother Karen Kent, who has kept a dignified silence since her son died, had ‘nothing to say.’

Mr Hockney’s sister Margaret said: ‘If the police are not going to prosecute then they must have their reasons. I have not asked David about this.’
