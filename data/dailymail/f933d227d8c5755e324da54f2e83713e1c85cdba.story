A car crashed into a Florida church Sunday night during a packed Easter service, injuring 21.

Around 8pm, as more than 200 parishioners were in the Second Haitian Baptist Church in Fort Myers, a car careened through a church wall, trapping some people underneath the vehicle. Four people have traumatic injuries.

None of the injuries appear to be life threatening. However, some of the injured had broken bones.

'At this point, the investigation is being treated as a very unfortunate accident rather than a criminal act,' Fort Myers Police spokesman Lt. Victor Medico said, according to naplesnews.com.

'I had family in the church, but I don't know if they're hurt. They didn't call me and I can't call them,' Eddy Boice, who was walking around the church's parking lot seeking information, told the News-Press.

The church has been around for about five years.
