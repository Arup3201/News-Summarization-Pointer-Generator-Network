The deaths of 33 elephants in a remote park in Congo has led to speculation that the rebel Lord's Resistance Army is poaching the animals.

Ten were killed last Friday in Garamba National Park, according to African Parks, a conservation group that manages the park along with Congolese authorities.

Park rangers killed three poachers in a weekend gun battle in Garamba, in Congo's northeastern corner near South Sudan.

‘We have reason to believe that the major poaching thrust is emanating from the heavily forested Azande Domaine de Chasse, which has been a traditional base for the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA),’ Peter Fearnhead, the CEO of African Parks, wrote in a letter to other conservationists that the news agency Reuters obtained today.

Warlord Joseph Kony, the LRA leader indicted for war crimes by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, waged a brutal guerrilla war against the Ugandan government in the north of the country for nearly twenty years before fleeing with his fighters into the jungles of central Africa around 2005.

A 2013 report from human rights group Enough Project said the LRA had begun systematically killing elephants and trading poached ivory for food, weapons, ammunition and other supplies.

Mr Fearnhead wrote it was not yet clear ‘whether the current poaching onslaught emanates from the LRA, Sudanese poaching gangs, local Congolese poachers, or a combination of these.’

Garamba is home to around 1,800 elephants, according to African Parks, and has been targeted by poachers in the past.

Twenty-two elephants were killed and their tusks and genitals removed in a single 2012 attack suspected of being carried out by the LRA.

However, the rebels' involvement in the killings was never confirmed and some harbour doubts that the LRA is behind the latest wave of poaching.

‘We hear the elephants were killed by professional poachers. That is not the LRA,’ said Rev Benoit Kinalegu, a Catholic priest who heads a network monitoring LRA attacks and movements from the town of Dungu on the edge of the Garamba park.

‘This area is so militarised it is impossible to know who it was,’ he said.

A 5,000-strong African Union Regional Task Force, supported by 100 U.S. Special Forces, is hunting for Kony and his commanders, who are accused of abducting thousands of children to use as fighters in a rebel army that has earned a reputation for mutilating its victims.

While Kony is believed to be hiding in a Sudanese-controlled area of a disputed enclave in South Sudan, according to the United Nations, his fighters continue to operate in an isolated zone straddling South Sudan, Congo and Central African Republic.

The Lord’s Resistance Army, also known as the Lord’s Resistance Movement, is a militant religious movement, which operated in northern Uganda and South Sudan. The LRA has been accused of widespread human rights violations, including murder, abduction, mutilation, child-sex slavery, and forcing children to participate in hostilities.

The LRA was originally formed to resist the Uganda People's Defence Force before it took control of the country. The UPDF has been accused of widespread murder, rape, and pillage. In June 2006, Radhika Coomaraswamy, the United Nations' special representative for children, found that more than 5,000 children had been recruited into the Ugandan government army.

Ideologically, LRA believe in African mysticism and Christian fundamentalism. It claims to be establishing a theocratic state based on the Ten Commandments and local Acholi tradition.The group is led by Joseph Kony, who proclaims himself the spokesman of God and a spirit medium.By 2008, it was thought he had more than 50 children and more than 80 wives.
