A breast cancer survivor has told of the ‘amazing and uplifting’ experience of joining a choir made up of women with the disease.

Sharon Malyan, 55, is part of the Sing to Beat Breast Cancer Choir which is releasing a fundraising single on Sunday.

The group of 20 women teamed up with singer Camilla Kerslake and vocal trio Blake to record the moving cover of ‘You Raise Me Up’.

Sharon Malyan, 55, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2004 and had to have a year of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. She believes that if her cancer had been diagnosed any later she would not still be here

Mrs Malyan, from Coulsdon, in the London Borough of Croydon, told MailOnline: ‘It’s been the most amazing and uplifting experience.

‘It was a wonderfully moving experience and I am honoured to be a small part of it.’

Mrs Malyan was diagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004 after doctors found two tumours.

She says she was suffering from 
extreme tiredness but was in a state of denial so did not notice one of 
her breasts had grown and that it had a dimple on it.

She
 was only diagnosed when the breast started to ache prompting her to 
visit her GP who gave her an emergency referral for further tests.

She
 said: ‘I was so lucky as if I had left it any longer I don’t think I’d 
still be here today because the cancer had already started to spread to 
the lymph nodes.’

Mrs Malyan, who was a co-ordinator for Croydon Adult Education when she was diagnosed, had two courses of chemotherapy, surgery and radiotherapy.

In all, her treatment lasted for a year.

As a result of her experience, Mrs Malyan is retraining as a Reiki teacher and will specialise in working with people with cancer.

She is also helping to raise money and awareness about breast cancer.

She said: ‘I want to help change the quality of life of people with cancer.

‘Wouldn’t it be amazing if we could find a way of preventing it? My belief is you don’t just pay back – you pay forward. We can not just move mountains – we can make miracles happen.

‘I feel as though I have been saved and I want to make that survival count.’

As a result of her involvement with breast cancer fundraising she heard about the Sing to Beat Breast Cancer Choir which is raising money for the charity Breast Cancer Campaign.

The lead singer in the choir is Camilla Kerslake who became an ambassador for Breast Cancer Campaign after her mother suffered from the disease

The lead vocals in the choir is singer Camilla Kerslake who became an ambassador for Breast Cancer Campaign after her mother suffered from the disease.

She said: ‘When my mother finally regained her health, after nearly two years of operations, procedures and a string of debilitating complications, my first thought was “what can I do to repay the people who saved her?”.

‘Having been asked by Breast Cancer Campaign to record a single for them I knew I had to choose a song that would be relevant.

‘”You Raise Me Up” is an incredibly poignant, yet uplifting song about what you can achieve when someone you love supports you.

The single will be released on Sunday and 50p from every sale will go to Breast Cancer Campaign to pay for research into the disease

‘I chose it because, in a way, it reflects the struggle our wonderful survivors’ choir, and cancer sufferers everywhere, face daily.

‘The song’s message is one of hope, strength and unity - traits we must all employ in the on-going fight against breast cancer.’

She added: ‘I wanted to create a choir of women directly affected by breast cancer because I believe both music and a sense of belonging can be immensely healing.

‘I wanted to share the joy I feel on stage and provide them with an enjoyable way to give back.

Ms Kerslake invited Blake (pictured with Ms Kerslake) - Humphrey Berney, Ollie Baines and Stephen Bowman - to collaborate with her on the single

‘I cannot state fully enough how proud I am of all that the choir has achieved, they have overcome the most horrendous odds, joined together and raised their voices in song to save future generations from the ravages of breast cancer.’

Ms Kerslake invited Blake - Humphrey Berney, Ollie Baines and Stephen Bowman - to collaborate with her on the single.

They said: ‘We are thrilled to be singing on the single and were honoured when Camilla asked us to be part of something that is so very close to her heart.

‘We all personally know people who have been affected by breast cancer and having heard about Camilla’s mother’s battle with cancer and what her family have gone through we wanted to be involved and to try and make a difference.’

The song can be downloaded from iTunes from Sunday and 50p from every download will go to Breast Cancer Campaign to help fund research into the disease.

Mrs Malyan said: ‘I am just hoping that everyone will jump on board to support it.

‘It has been an amazing experience working with Camilla and the boys from Blake – it has been a privilege.

‘They were all so kind and encouraging.’
