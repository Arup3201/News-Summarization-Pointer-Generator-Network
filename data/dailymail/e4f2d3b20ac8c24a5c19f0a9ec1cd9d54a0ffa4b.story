Manchester United have been offered Darijo Srna from Shakhtar Donetsk.

The Croatia international is 32 but intermediaries are pushing for a short term move as cover for Rafael.

United are short in the right back area and have been scouting for alternatives with Dani Alves of Barcelona also offered to them.

Srna, known as the 'Icon of Shakhtar' has turned down offers to join Chelsea and Bayern Munich in the past.

He has 120 caps for Croatia but was still clocked at 20.5mph for his sprinting during the World Cup in Brazil.

However, a move for Srna would go against Ed Woodward's message this week that United were not looking for short term fixes to their problems.
