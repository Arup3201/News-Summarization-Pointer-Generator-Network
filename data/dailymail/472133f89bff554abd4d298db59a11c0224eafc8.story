The First Lady has already given her seal of approval to Jason Wu's new diffusion line, having worn it on the campaign trail in October.

Now finally, just weeks before the January 7 launch, full lookbook images from the Miss Wu collection have been released.

The line takes a strong lead from the Sixties, with retro shifts and ladylike detailing.

First look: A lookbook for the new Miss Wu line from Jason Wu has finally been released ahead of next month's launch - though Michelle Obama wore a piece back in October at an event in Cincinnati, Ohio

Model Meghan Collison looks every inch the ingenue in the lookbook images. Hemlines, waistlines and hemlines are all at the higher end of the scale, striking a balance between flirty and demure.

Prints are key from Michelle Obama's green pixellated shift to butterflies and op-art rings.

But the best part, for fans of the designer, is that price points will be significantly lower than the mainline collection.

Ladylike: The designer believes his new lower-priced line will bridge a gap in the market

Affordable: Prices for Miss Wu start at $195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to $795 for a black leather jacket

Prices start at $195 for a sleeveless silk bow blouse to 
$795 for a black leather jacket. A 
garment from the Jason Wu collection, meanwhile, averages at about $1,700.

Intended to be 'playful and a little younger' than his main collection, Mr Wu, 29, told WWD: 'Instead of just doing "Jason Wu-for-less", the idea is to explore the other side of myself.

'I always see Jason Wu [the 
collection] as my aesthetic, my design sensibility. Miss Wu is my 
personality. It was really fun to explore that facet of who I am - 
slightly more downtown, and with a more relaxed attitude.'

Prints charming: Textiles reign supreme, from polka dots and stripes to butterflies

The collection will be available exclusively at Nordstrom for its first year - a huge coup for the store.

Jeffrey
 Kalinsky, the retailer's executive vice president of designer 
merchandising, explained: 'There’s a large audience who wants to wear 
his clothes.

'This 
collaboration has an appeal not just to a younger set of women, but to a
 broader set of women and at prices that are approachable.

Shift in time: The Sixties silhouette is a style signature for the collection

Save the date: The collection will be available exclusively at Nordstrom from January 7

'What’s great is that while feeling different from the Jason Wu signature collection, it still clearly has Jason’s design DNA.'

Mr
 Wu added that the new line will bridge a much-needed gap in the market.

'One thing that is rare in the contemporary market is more 
feminine, girlier clothes,' he said. 'It tends to be more hard-edged, or too young.
 I felt this is something that brings a little bit of softness.'
