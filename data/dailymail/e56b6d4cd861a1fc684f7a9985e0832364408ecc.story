Facebook has been forced to apologise to the family of a sick baby and offer them $10,000 in advertising credit after banning a photo of their young son awaiting heart transplant saying it was 'too graphic.'

Hudson, who is nearly two months, has the heart disease cardiomyopathy and desperately needs a heart transplant to survive so his father Kevin Bond posted a photo of him on a Facebook page called 'Hudson's Heart' to raise awareness and money for medical costs.

But when Mr Bond, a photographer from Atlanta, tried to advertise thepage for $20 the social media giant rejected the photo citing it as not adhering to their guidelines and being either 'scary, gory or sensational, and evokes a negative response.'

But today Mr Bond said Michael Buckley, Facebook's VP of global business communications, phoned and offered an apology. 

He wrote on Hudson's Heart: 'Yesterday Facebook called to offer an apology for refusing Hudson's ad based on his picture. 

'They explained that an automated system accidentally flagged Hudson's photo.

'They have offered $10,000 worth of Facebook ads to make amends.'

Mr Bond said he also brought up the wording of the rejection post which he says upset him and his fiancée Samantha Stevens. 

'I did ask that they change the wording of that letter if they are going to use an automated system to send that out,' Bond told The New York Daily News.

'Having my son's picture compared to ghouls and vampires was upsetting.'

Mr Bond said the family have donated $5,000 of the advertising credit to help a four-year-old girl who has a metabolism disorder called Sanfilippo Syndrome. 

In a statement Facebook said: 'This was a mistake on our part, and the ad has been re-approved. We apologize for any inconvenience this caused the family.

Speaking to ABC11 Mr Bond said: 'I don't like to think of the odds in a negative way - I think he's going to make it.' 

Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle. 

It is when the walls of the heart chambers have become stretched, thickened or stiff, affecting the heart's ability to pump blood around the body. 

Earlier this week Facebook refused to remove a video of a kitten allegedly being doused in petrol and set on fire because the footage does not breach any of the social network's rules.

In the shocking clip, two unidentified men can be seen apparently torturing a young kitten by stuffing it into a bucket, pouring flammable liquid over the animal and setting it on fire.

More than 14,000 users have commented on the clip - many expressing their disgust - but despite complaints, Facebook has not removed the two minute film.
