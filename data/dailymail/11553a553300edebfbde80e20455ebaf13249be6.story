Raheem Sterling used a made-up song title to hit back at those criticising him for telling Roy Hodgson he was too tired to play for England.

Sterling started on the bench for England's Euro 2016 qualifier in Estonia before being brought on in the 64th minute, and won the free-kick that led to Wayne Rooney's only goal.

After the match, at around midnight, the 19-year-old Liverpool winger said: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human. On my way home.'

But while Sterling made up a song title to let the world know his feeling on the matter, there were plenty of other real pieces of music he could have used to make his point. Here are 10 suggestions for what could have made up Sterling's sleepy playlist. 

(Perhaps Sterling could put them on his stereo for the next time he's on England duty?)

Sterling retweeted those criticising him online before writing: 'Now listening to... Excuse me for being human'

Sterling's sleepy playlist... 

1: The Beatles – I’m So Tired

2: The Who - Substitute

3: Tight Fit - The Lion Sleeps Tonight (Awimbawe)

4: Michael Jackson - Leave Me Alone 

5: Cage the Elephant - Ain't No Rest For The Wicked   

6: Ozzy Osbourne - So Tired 

7: Foo Fighters - Exhausted 

Given his infamous rock and roll lifestyle, it's no wonder that Ozzy Osbourne sang that he was 'So Tired'

8: Charles and Eddie - Would I Lie To You?

9: Wham – Wake Me Up Before You Go Go 

10: The Cure - Let's Go To Bed  

George Michael sang 'Take me dancing tonight' in this song, but Sterling might not agree with that sentiment

P.S.

Here's one song title Sterling definitely doesn't want to tweet...

Bruno Mars - The Lazy Song

P.P.S.

And here's one that Sterling's critics might want to reply with...

Junior Senior - Move Your Feet 

Junior Senior couldn't stop moving their feet, but that's not a feeling Sterling experienced in Tallinn

 P.P.P.S.

But both sides should try and avoid resorting to this...

Joe Dolce - Shaddap You Face
