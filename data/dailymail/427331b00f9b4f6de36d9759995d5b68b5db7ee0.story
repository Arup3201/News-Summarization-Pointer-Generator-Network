Coca Cola is to to produce its own brand of milk as it expands from carbonated sugary drinks.

The American drinks giant is making a daily pint called Fairlife which it predicts will ‘rain money’ for the firm.

The new product will cost double the price of traditional versions containing higher protein, less sugar and it will be lactose free.

Fairlife will contain 50 per cent more protein, 50 per cent less sugar than normal milk, and 30 per cent more calcium.

Coke’s move into the dairy business follows a shift into water and its Simply juices as profits fall from its main range of fizzy drinks.

The milk claims it has a longer shelf life than ordinary pasteurised milk - as ‘we pasteurise our milk at an even higher temperature for less time’.

Consumers are increasingly drinking healthier products containing less fat and sugar.

Speaking at a consumer conference Coke’s global chief customer officer Sandy Douglas said: ‘We’re going to be investing in the milk business for a while to build the brand so it won’t rain money in the early couple of years. But like Simply, when you do it well it rains money later.’

Douglas said that the milk which has been tested in Minnesota in America will ‘taste better and we’ll charge twice as much for it as the milk we are used to buying in a jug.’

The product is specially filtered to extract elements of fat and sugar and Coke hopes that it will compete in the rapid growth sports and energy drinks market.

It comes at a time when milk sales in America have been tumbling as consumers moved to orange juice and other drinks.

A spokesman said Fairlife is only available in America at present.

The firm has a chequered history in terms of launching new products in the UK.

In 2004 it was discovered that the main ingredient to its Dasani water brand which was priced at 95p a bottle was tap water. 

Bottled in south-east London, wags pointed out that Coke’s venture into water was remarkably similar to Del Boy’s attempts to sell Peckham water in Only Fools and Horses.

Later 500,000 of its bottles in the UK eventually had to be withdrawn after it was discovered the drink had been potentially contaminated with carcinogenic chemicals. 

The brand was never reintroduced to the UK.

The product is already available in the United States where it has a racy advertising campaign in place
