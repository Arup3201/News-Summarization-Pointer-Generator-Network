Controversial wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'as big a brain as I have boobs'

NHS boob job scrounger Josie Cunningham has claimed she doesn't mind being branded Britain's most hated woman and believes she has 'a bigger IQ than the majority of people'.

The 24-year-old, who shot to notoriety after boasting about having a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, described herself as 'very intelligent' before exclaiming: 'I've got as big a brain as I have boobs'.

The mother of three, from Leeds, who is set to star in a new documentary called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain?, has also revealed how she once applied to the Royal Navy, but had to forgo joining after falling pregnant.

It comes after Miss Cunningham, who announced her engagement to fiancé Andrew Goy last month, revealed she would be holding a party at the end of the month to celebrate the two-year anniversary of her breast augmentation.

Ahead of her new television show, which is set to air on Channel 4 tonight, the controversial glamour model said she doesn't mind the criticism she receives because she is 'actually hard-working'.

Speaking to Newsbeat, she said: 'Everybody just thinks I'm this fame-hungry b**** but actually I'm a hard-working parent.

'I think people are slowly realising there is a game there to be played.

'It's a whole case of don't hate the player - hate the game.

'All this hatred that comes with my name I'd say is worth it because I've got my name out there so much more from being hated.

'All of a sudden everybody knew my name so thanks for that - it's been great.'

Her comments came as she revealed she applied to the Royal Navy when she was 16-years-old and claimed officials wanted her to be in charge of weapons after she topped the IQ test.

She told The Sun's Antonella Lazzeri: 'I got the top marks in the class. I'd never done an IQ test but it was so easy.

'In fact I'm very intelligent. People think I'm stupid but I'm not. I've got as big a brain as I have boobs.

'I know I'm much brighter than most people because I missed about a year of school thanks to being bullied really badly, but still managed to pass eight GCSEs.'

She claimed that she did 'so well' in the IQ test that the Navy wanted her to be a warfare specialist, putting her in control of warship weapons and the coordinates.

The real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham follows her day-to-day life and shows her revelling in attention from paparazzi and members of the public.

A real-life documentary about Miss Cunningham (pictured leaving hospital with her newborn daughter and agent Rob Cooper last year) called Josie: The Most Hated Woman in Britain? is set to air on Channel 4 tonight

Miss Cunningham's agent confirmed on Twitter that the documentary would be screened on TV this month

It is set to air just over a month after she revealed she had got engaged to her 33-year-old body-building boyfriend by sharing a photo of her pink heart-shaped engagement ring online.

The announcement, which was later confirmed by a representative for Miss Cunningham, came just weeks after the couple were first pictured together in Leeds city centre.

There have been reports that Miss Cunningham is pregnant with Goy's child.

Last November, Miss Cunningham revealed she had wrongly told one man that he was the father of her baby daughter Grace by sending him the wrong DNA result.

She had asked three men to take a paternity test to determine who was Grace's father and wrote the outcome in cards to be delivered in time for Christmas Day.

But she allegedly mixed up the notes and sent the positive result to the wrong man.

Miss Cunningham shared her blunder with her Twitter followers before comparing her life to an episode of EastEnders.

It came after the mother, who also has two sons aged six and three, revealed she was planning to abort her baby for the chance to appear on Celebrity Big Brother. 

However, she later claimed she 'changed her mind' after discovering her baby was to be a little girl.

Josie Cunningham became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid for by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD.

She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested.

Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'.

Miss Cunningham's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting her unborn child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother.

The mother of three later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school.

The former escort made headlines again when she said she wanted a nose job - funded by the public.

She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation.

She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and said she wanted a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’.

It came after the wannabe glamour model, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night escort girl, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for.

Ahead of national A-level exam results being released in August last year, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice'

Towards the end of last year, the controversial wannabe glamour model stepped out with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her heavily pregnant bump, before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her daughter's boob job. 

It came after she decided not to abort her unborn baby afterall because she 'wanted a daughter'.

Afterwards, she decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000.

It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'.

She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink.

At one point, Miss Cunningham suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. 

Using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her.

However, she later said she had had a change of heart.
