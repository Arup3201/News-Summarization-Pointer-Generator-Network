Locked-up: Edmund Jaques, has been jailed for 18 months for running a money-spinning racket throughout East Anglia which conned the NHS out of £78,000

A dentist who cheated the NHS out of £78,000 by billing for 1,700 patients he did not treat - including some who were dead - has been jailed for 18 months.

Edmund Jaques, from Kentford, near Newmarket, Suffolk, was locked up yesterday after he ran a money-spinning racket throughout East Anglia called Home Dental Care Ltd.

The 64-year-old travelled to care homes throughout Suffolk, Essex and Cambridgeshire treating elderly residents who weren't able to visit a surgery.

Jaques had set up lucrative contracts with North East Essex Primary Care Trust and Cambridgeshire Primary Care Trust.

Andrew Shaw, prosecuting, said that during visits to care homes the dentist had specially asked for lists of residents which he had taken away with him.

Mr Shaw told Ipswich Crown Court: 'He would take these lists of residents away and fill out claim forms for treating patients without having treated them at all.

'On a number of occasions not only did he not provide treatment but because the population of care homes changed quite regularly a number of people for whom he was claiming to have provided treatment had died.'

Jaques, who has been a dentist for 41 years, aroused suspicion because he was claiming for such a high number of treatments.

Police searched his home and seized documents on which he had practised writing the signatures of senior care home staff so he could forge them on claim forms.

Jaques admitted fraud between June 16, 2009 and March 12, 2011 by dishonestly submitting multiple FP17 claim forms for payment of dental treatment in respect of patients neither seen nor treated by him.

Jailing him for 18 months, Judge John Holt said the dentist had been a respected professional who was expected to be trusted.

Judge Holt made a confiscation order for £78,658 which will be paid as compensation to the NHS.

Craig Ferguson, defending, said Jaques had not pleaded guilty to the offence earlier because he had wanted to attend his daughter's wedding last month.

Mr Ferguson said he qualified as a dentist in 1972 and had started treating residents of care homes after he was seriously injured in a car crash and was left unable to stand all day treating patients in his surgery.

He said Jaques had been previously of good character and felt 'a deep sense of shame and remorse' for what he had done.

Mr Ferguson said he had obtained £78,000 from the NHS over a period of 21 months for 1,700 patients he had not treated.

He said that Jaques would never work as a dentist again.

Nearly 1,200 dentists in England and Wales earned more than £200,000 in the financial year 2007-08, official figures showed in August 2009.

The NHS Information Centre statistics show that 382 dentists - nearly two per cent of the total - earned more than £300,000 in the year.

Average take home pay for the 19,586 registered dentists was £89,062.
