David Cameron will have to resign if Scotland votes for independence, according to some Tories amid growing fears that the Yes campaign could win this autumn’s referendum.

One senior Conservative said Mr Cameron would ‘go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union’ and would have no choice but to quit Downing Street.

It came as Tory MPs called for a law change to block Scottish voters from taking part in the 2015 general election if they back independence later this year.

Votes in Scotland will have their say on independence in a referendum on September 18.

Recent polls have suggested that support for going it alone is rising, with the no campaign’s lead narrowing.

In a major political headache, if Scotland votes for independence it will not break away officially until 2016.

It means that in theory voters north of the border will still be able to take part in the 2015 general election to choose MPs for Westminster.

Senior Tories now want to ban all 59 constituencies north of the border from taking part in the general election.

The move would make a dramatic difference to the outcome of the election next year, wiping out a significant section of Labour's powerbase and a sizeable number of Liberal Democrats.

In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP.

So far, there has been no decision on what would happen to Scotland's Westminster seats between parliamentary elections and March 2016, when it would become an independent nation, in the event of a yes vote this autumn.

It is widely assumed that elections would continue as usual but Scottish MPs would then vacate their seats when links are severed.

Tories believe it would unacceptable, however, for them to hold their seats while London and Edinburgh were negotiating the break-up of the UK

Scottish-born John Stevenson, who represents Carlisle, told The Times: ‘Why should the peoples of Northern Ireland, Wales and England have laws passed in this House by MPs who for all intents and purposes are about to be part of a foreign country?’

Downing Street insists Mr Cameron is focussed on winning the referendum to keep Scotland in the UK, so the issue will not arise.

But privately many Tories believe his position will be untenable if voters back independence.

A minister said: ‘It would be very difficult because he would go down in history as the Prime Minister who lost the union.’

A No 10 source said: ‘The Prime Minister is focused on making the case for Scotland to remain part of the United Kingdom.’

A record 4.1million Scots are now registered to vote as more people sign up to take part in the independence referendum.

The
 figure is almost 60,000 more than in December 2012 and has been fuelled
 by 16 and 17-yearolds who are not eligible to take part in General or 
Scottish elections but can do so in the referendum.

Around 92,000 out of a possible 120,000 young Scots have signed up.

The
 figures have been compiled by the Electoral Commission's 15 Scottish 
electoral registration officers (EROs), following an annual canvas of 
voters between October 2013 and March 2014.

The
 deadline to register to vote in the independence referendum is 
September 2, 2014. Andy O'Neill, head of the Scotland office at the 
Electoral Commission, said: 'The snapshot provided by the publication of
 the electoral registers gives an indication of the hard work already 
put in by electoral registration officers, but that hard work doesn't 
stop now.

'The EROs will 
continue to encourage as many people who are eligible to register to 
take action and get themselves registered before the September 2 
deadline, in order to take part in the referendum.

'The
 commission will support EROs activities by launching a public awareness
 campaign in the summer, reminding people that the only way to vote at 
the referendum is to be on the register.'
