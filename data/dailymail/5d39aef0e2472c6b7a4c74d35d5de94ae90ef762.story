'All dressed up with only a hotel room to go to' was the provocative theme for Marc Jacob's autumn/winter 2013 catwalk spectacle for Louis Vuitton.

And in a three minute promotional video for the collection, entitled 'Ladies of the Night', models Kate Moss, Cara Delevingne and Georgia May Jagger are seen posing along the Rue du Pont Neuf in Paris in the most minimal pieces.

Now the video has come under fire by a leading French daily newspaper for 'promoting prostitution'.

'It is an extremely shocking representation of women,’ said Dominique Attias, a leading lawyer who signed a letter criticising Louis Vuitton published in French left-wing newspaper Libération.

The letter published in the newspaper with a circulation of over 140,000 slammed the Gallic fashion
 house for 'assimilating luxury with the world’s second most profitable 
criminal activity after drug trafficking'.

It was also signed by Chantal 
Jouanno, a former centre-right minister, Laurence Rossignol, a Socialist
 Senator, and the Scelles Foundations Against Sexual Exploitation, 
reported the Times.

Accompanied by haunting piano music, the
 film shows Cara walking the dark streets of Paris as if waiting to be 
picked up or on a 'walk of shame' home.

Meanwhile model Magdelena Frackowiak 
flashes her derriere as she walks down a Parisian alley in just a fur 
coat and heels while other raunchy scenes see a model flashing her chest
 in the back of a car.

The short film also stars a a scantily-clad Edie Campbell, Saskia de 
Brauw, Isabeli Fontant and Lily McMenamy as it cuts from the outdoor 
scenes to the models stomping on to the
 catwalk in this season's Paris Fashion Week show.

There was a melancholy note to Marc Jaconbs' autumn/winder 2013 show at Paris Fashion Week showcasing his new collection.

It encapsulated, in the designer's own words, 'an attitude of getting dressed up only to find the most glamorous destination is one's own hotel room', reported Grazia.

Mrs Attias said Louis Vuitton had 
'portrayed women’s bodies as an object and prostitution as something 
that is playful and enjoyable'.

'This is very damaging because we are
 trying to fight the idea, to which some young women in France 
subscribe, that prostitution is banal, and just a way of getting money 
to buy some new clothes,' she said.

Louis Vuitton has declined to comment
 on the controversy, however the Times reported that a source close to 
the fashion house said that it had never authorised the prostitution 
video.

The film was made for Love, the 
British fashion magazine edited by Katie Grand, a stylist who works as a
 consultant for Louis Vuitton.

Grand told Grazia magazine: 'I knew the character was [director James Lima's] kind of woman, she was French and a lady that enjoys the night time.'

A credit at the end of the video 
offers 'special thanks' to Mr Jacobs, implying that he approved it, 
although the source in Paris claimed that was not the case.

The video circulated on the internet as Jacobs announced that he had taken a role as a pornography baron in a movie, Disconnect.

Mrs Attias described the video as 
'devastating for the image of women' but also criticised Louis Vuitton’s
 Paris show, which featured models in what appeared to be hotel 
corridors.

'What indecency, what ignorance, what
 indifference to play with the fantasy of chic pornography: the social 
condition of the immense majority of people who prostitute themselves is
 in no way enviable, and in no way happy.

'Do creators from the universe of luxury realise that they are promoting violence, pornography and sexual slavery?'
