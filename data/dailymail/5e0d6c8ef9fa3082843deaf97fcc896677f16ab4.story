Last year, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg encouraged all females on planet earth to achieve greatness with her book 'Lean In' - but managed to make most of us feel slightly pathetic in the process with her personal tales of achievement.

This year, American life coach Tara Mohr comes to the party with a slightly less daunting variation on the theme. 

Her newly launched book Playing Big, which has already received high praise Stateside, promises to equip women with the practical tools to 'quiet self-doubt, find their voice and identify their dreams'.

It's no small promise but one which women's leadership expert Tara believes is achievable. Playing Big, she says, is about helping women find their voice.

Reach for the sky: Playing Big by life coach Tara Mohr encourages women to 'quiet self-doubt, find their voice and identify their dreams'

'Five years ago, I began to see a pattern in my work: women with tremendous talent, ideas and aspiration often didn’t see their own brilliance,' she says.

'Too often, they were sitting on their big ideas rather than sharing them, holding back their most provocative questions rather than asking them.'

This isn't only a book for high-flying businesswomen, the ideas are as relevant to stay-at-home mums as they are for CEOs. 

It includes advice on how to quieten your inner critic, embrace fear and communicate with power.

The author also believes we need to unleash our naughty schoolgirl in order to play big and has dedicated a chapter  on how to drop 'good schoolgirl habits', like not showing off.

But self-promotion, she points out, is a tricky balancing act for women.

'Research shows that women incur social costs for advocating for themselves too strongly; they are seen as less likable by those around them, especially by other women,' she says.

'Yet studies also show that women who don’t advocate for themselves at all are not seen as competent leaders. There is a tricky middle ground to find.'

So how do we find this illusive point between allowing ourselves to be overlooked and coming across big-headed?

Tara's first piece of advice is to drop the idea of 'self-promotion' and think about the concept of visibility.

'When you shift the frame to visibility, you’ll notice it’s not all about you. Instead, it becomes about making your work and ideas available to those who can utilize them,' says Tara.

She also advises telling the whole truth. 'Women tell many little lies - lies of omission - about their accomplishments' she says.

'For many women, it’s helpful to think about “telling the whole truth” rather than about self- promoting,

'Traditional schooling gives women many important skills, but it doesn’t teach many of those most essential for leadership,' she says.

'As women transition from student mode to career, they must add to their tool kit: the ability to challenge authority, the ability to improvise, the ability to draw on and trust what they already know and the ability to make their work visible to others.' 

The author has won praise from high-profile women including Maria Shriver, who describes the book as 'inspirational'.

Another fan, author of Eat, Pray, Love, Elizabeth Gilbert, says of the book: 'I hope it will empower legions of women to step into their greatness. I couldn’t be happier about this publication.'

So what are you waiting for?...Greatness awaits.
