'She didn't stop driving like crazy,' said Kansas City Police Capt. Chris Sicoli

Bystanders survey the damage from the speeding car - police have launched an investigation 

'She didn't stop driving like crazy,' Kansas City Police Capt. Chris Sicoli told Kansas City Star.

Kansas City Fire Battalion James Garrett said she had to be removed from the vehicle and that she is lucky she did not suffer any life-threatening injuries.

'If you can see all the bricks and the building on top of the car, as well as the other vehicle, the party actually had to be extricated,' he told FOX4KC.  

'They're very worried the entire building has been weakened by the collapse,' Garrett said.

The building could be demolished once the structure has been examined.
