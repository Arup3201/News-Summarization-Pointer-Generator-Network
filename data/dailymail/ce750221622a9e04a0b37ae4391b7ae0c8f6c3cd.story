A private hospital has stopped all surgery on children after a damning report said patients’ lives were being put at risk.

The unpublished report from the health watchdog said children admitted for surgery at the hospital in Guildford, Surrey, were ‘particularly at risk of unsafe and inappropriate care and treatment’.

It follows inspections in January at the hospital, run by BMI, one of Britain’s biggest private healthcare groups, in response to concerns raised with the Care Quality Commission.

The report into Mount Alvernia hospital, Guildford, found children were 'particularly at risk of unsafe care'

The report into Mount Alvernia hospital was due to be published yesterday but has been delayed, according to the CQC.

It states categorically that patients’ lives were at risk at the luxury 76-bed hospital, where every room is en-suite. It reads: ‘The care and treatment provided to patients at BMI Mount Alvernia hospital was unsafe.

‘People were put at significant risk of harm to a life-threatening level. Children admitted for surgery were particularly at risk of unsafe and inappropriate care.’

Inspectors had several serious concerns, including occasions when surgery was unsafe and staff being told not to resuscitate some patients when their condition deteriorated, even though there had been no discussion with the patient or relatives.

It also says communication in the hospital was poor.

One patient was transferred from an NHS hospital by his consultant ‘when the patient was acutely unwell’. But the patient was not then reviewed by the consultant who admitted him to Mount Alvernia, and deteriorated. There was no communication with the previous consultant.

When the patient’s condition worsened the consultant told staff not to resuscitate, even though there had been no discussion with the patient or relatives as to their wishes.

Concerns were also raised by an incident where surgery was carried out in an area without the correct system for ventilation and the disposing of gases used in anaesthesia.

The report says: ‘The unit was therefore unsuitable for undertaking any procedures under general anaesthetic and the lack of theatre-standard ventilation posed a danger of infection to patients undergoing anything but very minor surgery.’

Inspectors considered this a particular danger to children.

BMI Healthcare is one of the biggest providers of private healthcare in the UK and earned more than £200million from the NHS in 2011.

The report, when published, may raise questions about the Government’s encouragement of more private sector involvement in the NHS.

BMI Healthcare has written to patients to apologise.

Chief executive Stephen Collier said: ‘I would like to go on record to state that the failings at Mount Alvernia during 2012 were entirely unacceptable.’

A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘BMI agreed to voluntarily suspend children’s surgical admissions at the hospital and to start making other changes required.

‘We have continued to monitor the hospital closely. Full details of our inspection will be published shortly.’
