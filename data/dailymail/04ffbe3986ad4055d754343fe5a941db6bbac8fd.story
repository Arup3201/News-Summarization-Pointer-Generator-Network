Murdered: Jane McRae, 55, died after her husband, Kenneth, 52, smashed a perfume bottle into her head in their home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands

This is the woman who was bludgeoned to death in bed by her husband before he killed himself over fears their home was blighted by Japanese knotweed.

An inquest heard how nature-lover Jane McRae, 55, was battered by her husband Kenneth, 52, with a bottle of perfume as she lay in their bed, suffering fatal head injuries.

In a suicide note, he said he killed his wife because the balance of his mind had been 'disturbed' by knotweed at their home in Rowley Regis, West Midlands.

He wrote: 'I believe I was not an evil
 man, until the balance of my mind was disturbed by the fact there is a 
patch of Japanese knotweed which has been growing over our boundary 
fence on the Rowley Regis Golf Course.'

The doctor claimed golf course managers had been made aware of the problem but nothing had been done.

After
 trying to curb the weed's growth unsuccessfully, he said the risk of 
structural damage and legal battles 'led to my growing madness.'

He added: 'Jane and I were a very private couple, we chose to have no real friends, just enjoying each other.

'But the despair has got so bad that 
today I have killed her, as I did not want her to be alone without an 
income when I killed myself.'

Today the couple's adopted son, photographer Mark McRae, said he did not know what drove his adoptive father to the crime.

The 27-year-old told the Express and Star: 'The police told me about the note, but I spoke to a neighbour and knotweed has not been an issue noticed. I have also lived here since August, and it has not been a problem.

'I donâ€™t understand it, no-one understands it. They had a successful life, they had money â€“ something else could have been going on.'

An
 inquest at Smethwick Council house ruled Dr McRae, who worked at Solvay
 chemicals plant three miles away in Langley, unlawfully killed his wife
 before committing suicide.

A police investigation found she may 
have lain dead in bed on the second floor of the three-storey house for 
up to a week. Dr McRae had been found with injuries on the first floor 
of the home.

Police had broken into the reclusive couple's home after concerns were raised by the lab technician's colleagues.

Order of service: An inquest heard that Mrs McRae's husband was worried about Japanese knotweed, right

Black
 Country coroner Robin Balmain said it appeared Dr McRae had suffered 
from paranoia over the knotweed, which was not found on their property, 
although a patch of the invasive plant had been discovered nearby.

Neighbours also later claimed the area had suffered from knotweed before homes were built on the site.

Mr
 Balmain said: 'This is clearly a tragedy. They appeared for whatever 
reason to keep themselves to themselves, they were perfectly entitled to
 do that.

'The impression is Mr McRae was possibly becoming paranoid, there is no direct evidence of that of course.'

He
 had got a responsible job as a lab technician, his own home free from 
mortgage. It appears he became obsessed with Japanese Knotweed in the 
vicinity, which was not even on his property.

Street: A neighbour of the McRaes in Rowley Regis said they were a 'reclusive but very devoted' couple

'It
 is perfectly clear he chose to kill his wife. It is difficult to 
understand what was going on in Mr McRae's mind. For whatever reason he 
killed his wife and then himself.'

The
 court heard the couple were estranged from their family and had not 
even spoken to their adopted son, Mark McRae, for over a decade. Their 
family declined to comment after the hearing.

A neighbour of the McRaes' described the couple as 'reclusive but very devoted'.

Avril Cowdell, 70, said: 'I have lived opposite them for years and I've never seen a visitor go into their house.

'They
 were reclusive but seemed very devoted to each other.  Jane was very 
friendly - she would cross the street to say hello to me if she saw me 
out walking my dog, and was a lovely lady.'

She said the only note of discord she noticed between the couple was that Mrs McRae loved the house and said she would never leave it, while she told neighbours her husband was worried about knotweed and wanted to sell up.

'He wanted to sell and she didn't,' she said.  'She said: "I'll never move from here - I love it."1

Kenneth McRae, 52, battered his wife with a bottle of perfume as she lay in their bed, causing fatal head injuries

The neighbour continued: 'Jane said she had OCD [obsessive compulsive disorder], and was always out sweeping the front path, dusting and cleaning.

'Once she even repainted the whole house - she said she had to go to the doctor as she had repetitive strain injury from emulsioning every room.'

Mrs Cowdell said that while Mrs McRae, whom she described as a nature lover, was originally from Birmingham, her husband came from Scotland, and the couple frequently went there for weekends away.

She added: 'I never saw them arguing.  They seemed very happy, although the husband would never say hello to me or anyone else.'

She said they had adopted a son, who is now a photographer, when he was around three, and he lived with them until he was about 17, and their relationship apparently cooled.

Mrs McRae had a keen in interest in the environment, the neighbour said, while her husband, who had a PhD in a science discipline, worked night shifts at a local laboratory and often had trouble catching up on his sleep during the day.  She also said he was a keen runner, going out for up to one and a half hours at a time.
