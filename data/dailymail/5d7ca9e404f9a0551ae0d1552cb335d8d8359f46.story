Former Prime Minister Winston Churchill was famous for his bulldog spirit but a letter has emerged showing he was a big softie when it came to his dogs.

The Second World War leader wrote of his sad loss following the death of his beloved pet dog Rufus in 1947 and how he couldn't bear the prospect of losing another when the mutt's replacement fell ill.

Rufus was a small poodle who died after being struck by a car. Within a few months Churchill had been given another French miniature poodle who he named Rufus II. But soon after Churchill received him, the dog became seriously ill.

The great leader wrote a letter to Bella Lobban, who ran a London kennels that looked after Rufus II whenever Churchill was absent, in which he admits he is fearing the worst.

In his 1948 letter (pictured), Churchill admits if Rufus II dies he cannot bear the prospect of losing a third

He wrote: 'I am so sorry that Rufus has developed this distressing complaint, and I hope you will let me know at the end of the three weeks whether or not he has recovered.

'After the said loss of the first one, I feel that I would rather not have another dog just now. Please do not therefore look for another poodle for me.

'I am very grateful to you for the trouble you have taken in looking after Rufus during my absence abroad. Pray let me know what is owing in the way of veterinerary [sic] fees.'

As it turned out, Rufus II made a full recovery and lived to the ripe old age of 15 before dying in his sleep in 1962. He was buried in the garden at Chartwell, Churchill's home in Kent.

The letter is now coming up for sale along with six charming thank you notes Churchill wrote to Mrs Lobban for gifts she sent to Rufus II throughout the 1950s.

Many of the personal notes are similar in content, with one dated 1958 stating typically: 'It was indeed kind of you to send Rufus a new collar and lead. It suits him well, and he is most proud of it.'

Churchill, who outwardly presented himself as a very formal and stoic character, was a great animal lover and had a 'menagerie' of pets at Chartwell.

He had a great love for cats, especially Jock, a marmalade-coloured moggy with white bib and socks, that comforted him in the latter years of his life.

One of Churchill's last requests was that there always be a cat with four white paws and white bib residing at Chartwell.

Earlier this year the National Trust, which was left the property by Churchill's family in 1966, welcomed Jock VI after Jock V left when its owner, the former house and collections manager at the property, moved to Scotland.

His affection for Rufus was said to have extended to letting him eat in the family dining room at meal times.

He is also said to have covered the dog's eyes while watching a scene from Oliver Twist in which the character Bill Sykes drowned a dog.

The letters are being sold by a private collector at Los Angeles auctioneers Nate D Sanders.

A spokesman for the auction house said: 'Winston Churchill was devastated when Rufus was killed after being struck by a car while attending a political conference in 1947.

'Walter Graebner, who edited Churchill's war memoirs for a magazine format, gave him another dog, whom Churchill named 'Rufus II'.

'These letters to Miss Lobban show Churchill's love and dedication to his dog, while highlighting his appreciation for the Miss Lobban's dedicated care towards his canine companion.'

Katherine Barnett, the house and collections manager at Chartwell, said: 'Churchill loved all animals enormously, they played a huge part in his personal life.

'He was devastated when Rufus was killed but it wasn't just dogs he had a passion for, he was also very close to his pet cats.

'When one cat ran away for a few days after he shouted at it, Churchill put up in a note in a window at Chartwell saying "all is forgiven".'

The series of latter, that are being sold by a private collector, have a started bid of £7,500 and the online auction runs to Thursday.
