Celebrity Chef Mario Batali and his partner Joseph Bastianich have agreed to hand over $5.25 million to employees at Batali's several high-profile Italian restaurants.

Man-in-charge Batali who was grilled last year for saying 'The way the bankers have toppled the way that money is distributed, and taken most of it into their own hands is as good as Stalin or Hitler, the evil guys', was charged with skimming dough from his own hardworking staff.

Two thirds of the settlement will be shared by 1,100 captains, servers, busboys and various staff at restaurants like Babbo, Bar Jamon, Casa Mono, Esca, Lupa, Otto, and others provided they worked from July 22, 2004 to February 14, 2012, according to court documents.

Batali has been accused with taking a percentage of server's tips to pay sommeliers' salaries

Stephanie Capsolas who sued Batali was a former employee at the restaurant, 'Babbo' in Manhattan's West Village

The Plaintiffs argued that Batali's restaurants would take 4-5 per cent of tips from employees in order to pay sommeliers' salaries.

Workers also claim they were often forced to work over 40 hours a week without even making minimum wage.

The 117 plaintiffs were led by Stephanie Capsolas, a former waitress and Hernan Ricardo Alvarado, a former kitchen runner both employed by Babbo in New York's West Village.

They are represented by law firms Outten & Golden LLP and Joseph, Herzfeld, Hester & Kirschenbaum LLP.

The Huffington Post reports that Martin Kirschenbaum is deemed the 'scourge of restauranteurs' because of his success rate after placing legal actions against famed restaurants like Batali's.

When the workers sued two years ago, Bastinaich tried to prevent workers from joining the suit by saying, 'only the lawyers make money on these lawsuits, reported The New York Daily News.

Capsolas says she was harrased after filing suit and the word 'rat' was written on her locker at work.

Capsolas also claims that she was sexually harassed while working at Babbo.

This may be the biggest tip skimming settlement in history, reports The New York Daily News.

Previously the Shelly Fireman's Restaurant Group that owns restaurants such as Trattoria Dell'Arte, Cafe Fiorello, Fireman's of Brooklyn, Brooklyn Diner USA, Redeye Grill and Shelly's New York was forced to hand over $3.9 million to employees.

The Sparks Steakhouse had to pay $3.1 million and Nobu had to pay $2.5 million to employees shorted of tips.

Despite being sued for lots of dough, Batali has other ventures outside of owning restaurants. He's host of a show on ABC called 'The Chew.'
