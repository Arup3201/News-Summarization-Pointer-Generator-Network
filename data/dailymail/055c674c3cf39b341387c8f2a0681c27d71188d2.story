Cyclists across Australia are being urged to arm themselves with cameras so that they have evidence against motorists in court after a truckie was convicted of getting too close to one man on a bicycle.

In the Sunshine Coast, Queensland, a truck driver was handed a conviction for breaking a new rule, introduced in April, that means drivers must keep a 1.5m gap limit from cyclists at all times.

Safe Cycling Australia director Dave Sharp told Daily Mail Australia: ‘There are lots of people who take umbrage to our presence on the roads and a camera covers the cyclist if anything goes wrong.'

Warwick Fribance, 67, was spared a $341 fine because his lawyer argued he didn’t actually cause any harm by breaking the rule.

Mr Fribance was filmed overtaking too close to a cyclist who was wearing a camera while cycling along a two-lane road at 7.55am on July 4 this year .

Outside court Mr Fribance told the Courier Mail the cyclist had ‘a camera on his helmet and a big chip on his shoulder’. 

Mr Sharp, who is campaigning for the new Split Rule to be introduced across Australia and not just Queensland and the ACT, said: ‘More cyclists are buying cameras to help enforce the law.’

The minimum passing distance for motorists in Queensland is now a minimum of 1 metre when passing cyclists in a 60km/h or less speed zone and at least 1.5 metres where the speed limit is over 60km/h.

Motorists are allowed to cross centre lines, including double unbroken centre lines, straddle lane-lines or drive on painted islands to pass cyclists provided the driver has a clear view of any approaching traffic and it is safe to do so.

The minimum passing distance will be trialled in the state for two years and will help make drivers more aware of cyclists.

On 7 September 2011, cyclist Sean Harrison filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute

‘We always hear the argument that sticking to this rule would force drivers to overtake on the other side of the road but if there isn’t room they should wait … there is a brake pedal and we are more than ready to see them to use it,’ Mr Sharp said.

Recent research by Canstar Blue showed nearly half of drivers wish they didn't have to share the road with their two-wheeled nemesis. 

‘We certainly encourage cyclists to use cameras if they are road riders or sporting cyclists, they normally have the most issues on the road traffic.' 

A lawyer told Daily Mail Australia that using footage filmed on a cyclist’s camera is no different than using CCTV footage in court.

Without footage cyclists are often told it's just their word against the motorist, Mr Sharp said.

‘Police in Queensland have stated they are supportive of cyclists using the cameras if drivers are breaking the Split Rule,’ Mr Sharp added.

‘There is a small majority of drivers who seem intent on doing the wrong thing and then there are those that don’t pay attention to cyclists,’ he claimed.

The ACT followed Queensland’s lead and also introduced the Split Rule in April.

The rule will be trialled for 12 months as the government attempts to make cycling safer by keeping cars and bikes apart.

In NSW recently, a cyclist captured the frightening moment he was chucked over the windscreen of a car in Sydney.

Paul Ludlow said the footage convinced police that he had not broken the law.

Mr Ludlow was cycling home from work when a driver allegedly pulled out in front of him at the intersection of West and Falcon streets in Crows Nest on Sydney's lower north shore.

And on 7 September 2011, cyclist Sean Harrison filmed the moment he was hit by a white car during his early morning commute.

He broke his back in the accident and has been left with chronic back pain. 

Some of the most popular cameras used by cyclists are the Fly 6 device and the Go-Pro, which can cost hundreds of dollars but are deemed worth it.
