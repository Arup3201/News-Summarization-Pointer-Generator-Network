Busted: 25-year-old Robert Kiefer is facing assault and resisting arrest charges after getting into a fight with his postal worker over a late check

A man in Akron, Ohio allegedly sprayed his post office worker with pepper spray when a check he was expecting didn't arrive in the mail.

Robert Kiefer, 25, was so enraged over the late check that he even attacked police officers trying to break up his fight with the 56-year-old post office worker.

The fight broke out around 3:30pm Saturday when Kiefer became angry about the late check.

The post office worker told authorities that Kiefer grabbed his pepper spray and sprayed him in the eyes with the irritating chemical.

From there Kiefer continued to beat the worker, wrestling the man in the street about a half block from his home.

By the time police arrived, a small group had gathered around to watch the two men fight at the intersection of Kling and East Thornton streets.

The worker said Kiefer bit him three times in the leg during the fight.

When police tried to break the men up and arrest Kiefer, he fought back.

They subdued the crazed man by spraying him with pepper spray as well and he was booked at the Summit County Jail.

The post office worker was treated for bite and cut wounds at the scene.

Unable to post 1,000 bond (perhaps because of the late check), Kiefer remains in jail until his next pre-trial hearing on February 21.

He is facing misdemeanor charges of assault and resisting arrest.Â
