Nigel Pearson says he has no qualms parking the bus at Stamford Bridge but insists his Leicester City side will go for the jugular in attack.

Chelsea sliced Burnley to shreds in their opening game and are strong favourites to stage a repeat in their second match against the Premier League newcomers.

While Pearson admits any points picked up would be seen as a bonus in their battle to avoid the drop, he believes his team possesses the ability to spring a surprise.

Confidence: Pearson (centre) wants his Leicester City side to express themselves against Chelsea

‘When people talk about parking the bus it is not always that they want to do that – nobody wants to soak pressure up for long periods of time,’ he said.

‘But sometimes you work that hard when you don’t have the ball that when you get it players aren’t capable of changing their mindset.

‘I want our players, when we are at our best, for whoever is in possession of the ball to have more than two or three options.

‘Chelsea have fantastic players with good imagination, good technical ability, good movement. People don’t give us much hope.

‘But we have a pretty strong resolve and some very talented footballers. I want us to express ourselves. We have to defend as a team but attack as a team.’
