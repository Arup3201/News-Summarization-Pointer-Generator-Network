For his role as UN troubleshooter Gerry Lane in blockbuster zombie disaster move World War Z, Brad Pitt, one of the most sought-after stars in Hollywood, took home a cool £9million.

But a Scottish lawyer who also played Gerry Lane - as the actor's body double - took home a slightly more meagre fee - £4.44 an hour.

David Patterson, 26, an Edinburgh-based solicitor from Lasswade in Midlothian, started filming at 6am and had to be on set for 18 gruelling hours of filming in Glasgow. He was told not to speak to Mr Pitt, engaged to fellow superstar Angelina Jolie, and took home a modest £80 for his efforts.

Disparity: David Patterson, the body double for Brad Pitt in World War Z, earned just £4.44 an hour. By contrast, the superstar actor earned £9million for his role as a UN worker trying to survive an undead outbreak

Yet car-lover Mr Patterson, whose job takes him the length and breadth of Scotland, was glad to be involved in such an epic movie, which cost an estimated £250million to make, and said he didn't do it for the money.

He said: 'I basically had to be Brad for the day and copy everything he did on screen.

'Brad was there the entire time, and they were filming over the course of months, so it must have been quite tough.'

Despite his role in the film, which is tipped to have a sequel filmed next year, he told the Daily Mirror he hasn't yet found the time to watch it. He also wasn't invited to the UK premiere and didn't even get an autograph.

Yet he still relished the experience. Many of his scenes with Mr Pitt were filmed in a supermarket in Glasgow.

He followed the actor around, mirroring his actions as he ran through the shop desperately salvaging food as apocalyptic events rage outside.

Amazingly Mr Patterson made the spur-of-the-moment decision to try out as an extra during a shopping trip in Glasgow and didn't expect anything to come of it.

He told the Scottish Sun: 'I was actually in court when I got the message.

'I had to ask my boss if I could go but they were very supportive.'

'I needed to appear like I wasn’t starstruck — but I was.'

Mr Patterson was selected because his physique is similar to the Tinseltown sex symbol and had to wear identical clothes for the shoot.

He added: 'I had the same physique as him – we were both slim-built – though not any more, as I’ve put on weight since then. Brad’s a very professional guy and I had a job to do and I just did it to the best of my ability.'
