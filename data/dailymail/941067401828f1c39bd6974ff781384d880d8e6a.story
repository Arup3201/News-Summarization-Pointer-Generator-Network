If they were children they'd probably be told to grow up, but no one tells billionaires what to do.

That's why two of the world's wealthiest men are refusing to back down in their on-going 'mine's bigger than yours' battle to be the owner of the world's largest yacht.

Mega-rich Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, who currently owns the world's biggest private superyacht, appears to have been forced to carry out some urgent extensions after Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid launched a bid to regain the title.

It was only two years ago that Mr Abramovich bought his 557ft-long vessel and stole the crown from the Sheikh 532ft yacht called Dubai.

But, in the wake of rumours that Sheikh Mohammed is having his boat extended to recapture the title, Mr Ambramovich has perhaps not surprisingly booked his own yacht in for a refit in Barcelona harbour.

The mega-yacht is currently moored in the harbour, where it is covered in tarpaulin and scaffolding while the secret work is carried out by Marina Barcelona 92.

It is not known exactly what alterations are being done to the yacht, which Mr Abramavich - who will be in Munich tomorrow for the European Cup final - initially bought for around £330 million.

The final cost was believed to be £1billion by the time he paid for extra luxury fittings and security measures.

All aboard: It is unclear clear what work is being done behind the shied of white, but the refit comes amid rumours that fellow billionaire Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum is attempting to reclaim the world's largest yacht crown

The yacht comes with features including two helipads, a submarine, multiple hot tubs, a pool and a missile-detection system.

It is said to have two swimming pools - the larger of which converts into a dance floor when drained - bullet-proof glass, six-foot home cinema screens in each of the 24 guest cabins and a master cabin where the roof opens to allow Mr Abramovich and girlfriend Daria Zhukova to sleep under the stars.

The yacht also has armoured-plating around the master suite and a laser system designed to dazzle long-lens photographers.

Around 70 crew members are needed to operate the yacht, which has nine decks and can accommodate 30 guests.

It costs 50 million dollars to run each year and single re-fuelling costs around 650,000 dollars each time. Last summer Mr Abamovich hired it out for £2 million a week.

The yacht, which was constructed by Blohm and Voss in Hamburg, Germany, took four years to build.Mr Abramovich also owns four other mega-yachts, the Sussurro, Titan, Umbra and Luna.
