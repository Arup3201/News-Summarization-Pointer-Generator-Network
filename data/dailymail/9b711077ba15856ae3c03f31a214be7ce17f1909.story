They are a marvel of modern engineering - thin, virtually invisible, yet containing a computer and video camera.

Yet these tiny gadgets are causing major problems for banks - by 'skimming' credit card numbers and even recording PIN numbers.

The latest devices were revealed today as part of a new report from the European ATM Security Team (EAST), which warns they are already in use across Europe - with many of the fraudulent numbers being shipped to the US.

A mini-skimmer designed to slip inside of an NCR ATM's card acceptance slot: Experts warn they are becoming more advanced and commonplace across the world

The miniaturized insert skimmer above was used in tandem with a tiny spy camera to record each customer¿s PIN. The image on the left shows the hidden camera situated just to the left of the large square battery; the photo on the right shows the false ATM fascia that obscures the hidden camera as it was found attached to the compromised ATM (notice the tiny pinhole at the top left edge of the device).

  Pictured below is a device designed to capture the data stored on an ATM card’s magnetic stripe as the card is inserted into the machine.

While most card skimmers are made to sit directly on top of the existing card slot, these newer mini-skimmers fit snugly inside the card reader throat, obscuring most of the device.

This card skimmer was made to fit inside certain kinds of cash machines made by NCR.

According to a new report from the European ATM Security Team (EAST), a novel form of mini-skimmer was reported by one country.

While most card skimmers are made to sit directly on top of the existing card slot, these newer mini-skimmers fit snugly inside the card reader throat, obscuring most of the device.

This card skimmer was made to fit inside certain kinds of cash machines made by NCR.

'New versions of insert skimmers (skimmers placed inside the card reader throat) are getting harder to detect,' the EAST report concludes.

Researchers say many of the fraudulent details are sent to the US where they are used to withdraw money

The report also warns that the United States is the last of the G-20 nations that has yet to transition to chip & PIN.

'Card skimming at ATMs was reported by eighteen countries, with increases reported by six countries and decreases by four countries,' the organisation said.

'A new form of mini-skimmer was seen in one country and another reported that skimming devices are being left in place for longer periods (4-5 days on average).'

'Most ATM cards issued in Europe have a magnetic stripe on them for backwards compatibility when customers travel to this country,' said Brian Krebs, a security researcher.

'Naturally, ATM hackers in Europe will ship the stolen card data over to thieves here in the U.S., who then can encode the stolen card data onto fresh (chipless) cards and pull cash out of the machines here and in Latin America.'

'In countries where the ATM EMV rollout has been completed most losses have migrated away from Europe and are mainly seen in the USA, Asia-Pacific, and Latin America,” the EAST report said.
