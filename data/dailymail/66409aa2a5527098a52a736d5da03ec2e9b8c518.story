She is three months pregnant and happily settled, but love life wasn't always so blissful for Katie Piper.

The model, 30, has gone from strength to strength since she survived an horrific acid attack arranged by her ex-boyfriend Daniel Lynch in 2008. But she reveals getting back into dating after the ordeal was 'awful'.

'When I started dating again, it was like being 13 or 14 because I'd forgotten - should you kiss on a date? What do you wear? When do you text back? Do you have to pretend you don't like someone when you do?'

In a frank interview with the Sun's Fabulous magazine, Katie said while all her friends were starting 
to settle down she was 'feeling very insecure' and 'getting it all 
wrong'.

'There were people I thought liked me who actually didn't, people who maybe just felt sorry for me or wanted to go on dates with me to ask me about the TV show rather than because they fancied me... When I got rejected, instead of thinking "Oh well" I'd take it really badly. It was like being a little girl with no experience,' she said.

Katie is now coupled up with her boyfriend of 18 months, whom she keeps out of the limelight. They are expecting their first child together.

She said: 'I'm in love. With my boyfriend, it was never an issue or a big conversation. He would've known the news story about the girl who had acid thrown in her face, but he didn't know the ins and outs... It was me who brought it up in the end.'

In May 2009, Lynch and Sylvestre were told by the judge that they were 'the face of pure evil'. Both were jailed for life and Lynch will serve a minimum of 16 years.

Despite scarring her physically for life, the model from Andover, Hampshire, has enjoyed a successful career as a charity campaigner, presenter and spokesperson in the five years since suffering the life-changing event.

Katie
announced just a fortnight ago that she was 'beaming' after going to 
her 12-week scan last week, described the news of her pregnancy as 
'beyond incredible'.

Speaking of the happy news: 'I've always 
known that I have wanted children but there were moments after what 
happened to me that I never thought this would happen, I never believed 
this would be my future.

'It's beyond incredible,' she said, speaking to The Sunday Mirror.

'It's because I'm so happy about it that it's been so hard keeping quiet and I'm actually relieved to be able to tell everyone.'

Fans quickly reacted to the good news on Twitter, prompting Katie to reply she has been 'Overwhelmed by all the congratulations tweets and best wishes! Thank you so much has completely taken my mind of todays morning sickness! X'

The good news is a far cry from her 
her distressing experience five years ago, when violent ex-boyfriend 
Lynch raped Katie and held her captive in a London hotel for eight 
hours.

But his revenge for 
being rejected seemingly knew no bounds and two days later, under his 
direction, accomplice Stefan Sylvestre threw a cup of 
industrial-strength sulphuric acid in her face.

The attack on a London street melted her face, blinded her in one eye and left her with horrific burns.

Rushed
to the burns unit of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, Katie was 
showered with tap water for ten hours as medics fought to neutralise the
effect of the acid on her skin and prevent further damage.

Eye drops were also administered every few minutes to try to wash the acid away.

But
her injuries were unimaginable. The left side of Katie's face was 
burned away to the fat layer - the only thing beyond it was muscle and 
bone.

She lost the sight in 
her left eye and acid also dripped down her neck, ears and hands as well
as slipping into her nose and throat, with further terrible 
consequences.

Before and after: Katie had been an aspiring model before the attack in 2008, which left her with horrific burns

For more than a
year she had to be fed through a tube in her stomach and surgery to 
dilate her oesophagus. In total, she has endured more than 40 operations
since the attack.

As 
well as the physical damage, the attack left Katie fearful of going out 
in public and her self-esteem was at had all time low as she hated 
seeing her scarred face, which she had to cover with a protective mask 
for two years.

Katie has since won widespread support for her series of thought-provoking 
documentaries for Channel 4, written three books about her experience 
and has won awards - including Woman of the Year in 2011 and a Pride of 
Britain award.

She has also 
set up her own charity, The Katie Piper Foundation, to help other burn 
victims receive medical and emotional support.

Katie
is also now one of the new stars of the Marks & Spencer campaign, 
appearing alongside actress Helen Mirren and British female boxing 
champion Nicola Adams.
