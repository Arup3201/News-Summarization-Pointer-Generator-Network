She's loved for her bubbly, girl-next-door personality and he's known for his rippling abs and now it's official: Dan Osborne and Billie Faiers have been crowned the most desirable TOWIE cast members.

A new survey asked Brits which cast member from The Only Way is Essex they'd most like to go on a date with.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the overwhelming female favourite was Dan Osborne, who polled 61 per cent of the votes.

Voters said the 23-year-old new father had 'everything' they looked for in a man.

Nice guy Tom Pearce came in second place with 23 per cent of the votes and in third was playboy Mario Falcone.

James 'Diags' Bennewith hit a soft spot with the ladies, with his personality being voted as the best of the TOWIE boys.

Beth Morris, who took part in the research, said: 'Dan Osborne is the perfect man. With his body, face and job I’m sure he isn’t short of offers, now he has a child as well, he is responsible, which is a turn on for me.'

Another woman surveyed said: 'Give me a pint with Diags and I’d be happy. I'd take personality over abs all day!'

When it came to the ladies of Essex, Billie Faiers, fresh from an engagement and a pregnancy announcement, was voted as the ideal date partner attracting 34 per cent of the votes.

Former TOWIE star Lucy Mecklenburgh - often crowned best bikini body - came in close second, while Billie's sister Sam came in third place.

A male respondent said: 'Lucy is pretty much my ideal women, I like that she takes care of herself and I'd certainly treat her to a night out in Essex.'

A spokesperson from DatingPriceGuide.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'It's no surprise to see Lucy right up there.

'With her recent workout exposure to boot, she certainly is one of the most desirable women in the UK - but to be beaten by Billie might cause a bit of drama in Essex!

'There are some good looking characters in TOWIE but we found it great to hear the personalities of some of the other characters got a great response.'
