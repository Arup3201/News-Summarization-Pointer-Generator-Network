Talk about seventh heaven.

A Southern Baptist minister and his wife have staged a bed-in on the roof of their church to encourage parishioners to put the zing back in their marriages - by having sex for seven days straight.Â 

Inspired by John Lennon and Yoko Ono's infamous protest bed-ins for peace in 1969, Reverend Ed Young and his wife Lisa snuggled up on top of the Fellowship Church in Grapevine, Texas for a 24-hour 'Sexperiment'.

Inspiration: John Lennon and Yoko Ono staged a series of protest bed-ins shortly after getting married in 1969

By preaching the virtues of having sex, Ed Young is trying to send a message about faith and marriage, he told Houston's KHOU.

He said: 'We're bringing the bed back in church.'

The church has been silent about sex 
for too long, the Youngs believe.

Bed-in: The Youngs expand on their message in their new book

According to their teaching, by having sex everyday for a week married couples will become closer and strengthen their faith.

God is 'the author and creator of sex,' 
Lisa Young told CNN.

'Why would we not - in the context of church - speak
 about something that he was not bashful about?'

Sex is the 'superglue' in a Christian marriage, the pastor said.

'When
 you have the freedom and the joy and a mutually satisfying sexual 
relationship - when you see it from God's perspective - I think the 
lights come on and you discover your destiny as husband and wife,'

The elaborate stunt will help to promote the couple's new book, Sexperiment: 7 Days To Lasting Intimacy With Your 
Spouse.

The '24-hour 
bed-in' made use of a live webcam, with the couple giving bedside 
interviews and answering questions from Facebook and Twitter.

The Youngs were not planning to start their sexathon on the roof as, they told CNN, the bed is simply 'to make a statement'.

The couple's four children even joined them in bed with Lisa asking her teenage daughter what she thought about her parents writing a book about sex.

She said. 'It's pretty cool actually,' the LA Times reported. 'It's reassuring to know y'all are doing OK, that your marriage is kind of a model.'
