With 40 per cent of British choosing not to go on holiday abroad in the past year, it makes sense that the latest host of a TV show being jetted off to exotic locations doesn't want to be there either. 

Research conducted for Channel 4's new magazine-style show Travel Man claims 40 per cent of Brits have either chosen to take their breaks within the UK or didn't want to go overseas this year.

The same survey found 30 per cent of respondents, chosen to reflect a cross section of society, haven't left Britain for the past five years while one in 10 Brits have never been overseas

A significant 40 per cent of Britons didn't go overseas for their holiday in the past year, says a survey

The stress of it all is a big reason for this say 31 per cent of the survey subjects, a sentiment Ayoade can relate to on his mission to make the most of his destinations without the hassle. 

In the four-part series Ayoade travels with a celebrity guest to Iceland, Istanbul, Marrakech and Barcelona, where his journey begins with similarly non-plussed traveller Kathy Burke. His other celebrity travel companions for subsequent episodes are comedian Adam Hills, actress Jessica Hynes and actor Stephen Mangan

Much like his other show Gadget Man's attitude to life in general, Travel Man aims to get the most he can out of a holiday in the least time.

In Barcelona, Ayoade is particularly unimpressed by  the museum at the home of Lionel Messi's Barcelona FC, the Nou Camp, owing to his total disinterest in football.

Despite walking being a perfectly effective way to get around the city, Ayoade opts for a Trixi pedicab tour to take in sights such as the Christopher Columbus Monument, Santa Maria Church, and the Nou Camp as efficiently as they can. 

To get to Barcelonetta beach, Richard goes for a cable car instead of going by car with Kathy.

In Istanbul with Adam Hills, they go to the historic Hagia Sophia just before closing time to avoid the crowds and uses the Triposo app to ensure all the necessary information he needs is at his fingertips.

And to see as much of Marrakech as possible in a short period of time with Stephen Magain, Richard takes a hot-air balloon ride, use a compass-like trekking guide to find their way around the busy Souks and a currency converter app to aid with haggling. 

There is no short cut, however, when the pair appear to liven up during a Cava tasting - by actually tasting the famed Catalan sparkling wine.

The show's survey found 80 per cent of Brits prefer to test out local food and drink when they go abroad, and 60 per cent attempt to pick up some of the language of the place they're in.

Perhaps a surprise to many is that only 32 per cent of Brits will chose a break at the beach over a city break while 38 per cent of respondents have been back to a previous holiday destination.  

Australia is apparently the dream holiday destination for UK residents, however 23 per cent of us always choose somewhere within Europe to take leave time. 

Age and geography are other significant factor for travel, with 16 to 34-year-olds going on holiday the most (more than twice in the last year).

Travel Man: 48 Hours in Barcelona is on Monday night at 8.30pm on Channel 4.
