A baby boy died from meningitis hours after he was sent home from an out-of-hours health centre with Calpol.

His mother Jamie-Lee Ball says she took five-month-old Jayden-James to the clinic with a high temperature, cold hands and feet and purple spots on his neck.

She said she pointed out the rash to a doctor who carried out an examination at the out-of-hours service run by Bury And Rochdale Doctors On Call (Bardoc).

Loss: Five-month-old Jayden-James died from meningococcal septicaemia, blood poisoning caused by the infection

But Jamie-Lee, 18, says she was then told that her son had a viral infection - and was sent home with Calpol and Ibuprofen.

Within hours, Jayden-James's condition deteriorated and he was taken by ambulance to Fairfield Hospital in Bury, where he was given antibiotics. He had a heart attack and died. 

The Health Protection Agency (HPA) confirmed Jayden-James died from meningococcal septicaemia, blood poisoning caused by the infection. 

Bosses at Bardoc, the organisation which runs the out-of-hours service, have launched an investigation into the tragedy and said the care he received would be thoroughly examined.

Jamie-Lee, from Radcliffe, paid tribute to her 'perfect' son but demanded answers.

She said: 'He was very much loved. There were little purple spots on the back of his neck and that was the first thing that I said to the doctor at the clinic.

'The doctor said that he thought it was a viral infection but he could not give antibiotics because it had only just started that day.'

Jayden-James was born in April weighing 5lb 15oz.  Jamie-Lee said: 'It was just brilliant to hold him for the first time and I felt really lucky. He was fit and healthy and had loads of spiky black hair. He was a good little boy. I really loved him and always will.'

Jayden-James fell ill on October 6.

Jamie-Lee said: 'He wasn't taking his bottle and you could tell that he was weak.'

She rang Bardoc - run by doctors and commissioned by NHS Heywood, Middleton and Rochdale and NHS Bury - and was told at 7pm to take Jayden-James to the clinic.

The former-student said: 'I took him there instantly. The doctor checked his heart rate. His little heart was pounding. The doctor then checked his temperature. 

'There were little purple spots on the back of his neck. The doctor said he thought he had a viral infection. I took his word because he was a doctor. I told them of the symptoms and I told the doctor about the dark spots. He did examine the back of the neck then gave me Calpol and Ibuprofen.'

They returned home at around 8.30pm and Jamie-Lee put her son down to sleep.

She added: 'It was not long after that when he started to make moaning noises. The spots on the back of his neck had got bigger and darker. His breathing was shallow so I rang an ambulance.'

Jayden-James was given antibiotics and attached to a machine to help him breathe before they reached Fairfield Hospital.

Jamie-Lee said: 'The doctors were giving him a lot of liquids. They said he had to be taken over to the Children's Hospital in Manchester. He had a series of X-rays but he went into cardiac arrest.'

Jayden-James was resuscitated once but died that night.

Jamie-Lee added: 'He was a cheeky little boy who was always smiling. He had just started to get his own little personality and he was very intelligent.

'We used to call him our little boxer because he was always clenching his fist. I just feel that the doctor should have known what the problem was.

'We don't want anyone to go through what I have been through.'

Dr Zahir Mohammed, clinical director of BARDOC, said a review was under way. 

He said: 'Bardoc extends its sincere condolences to the family for their tragic loss. Bardoc has commenced a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding this very sad case.'

The Health Protection Agency said the tragedy was an isolated case.
