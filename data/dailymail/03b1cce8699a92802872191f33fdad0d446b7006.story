Radamel Falcao is about as a complete striker as you could wish to see. 

I remember watching him tear apart Chelsea in the UEFA Super Cup two years ago, when he scored a hat-trick in Atletico Madrid’s 4-1 triumph days after a treble against Athletic Bilbao in La Liga, so when I saw him in the flesh it was easy to see why he causes defenders such problems.

Radamel Falcao is 'about as complete a striker as you could wish to see', according to Glenn Hoddle

Intelligent movement 

His movement off the ball is phenomenal, which means it’s just so hard to contain him. He reminds me of Hernan Crepso, the Argentina striker who, like Falcao, played for River Plate and it would not surprise me if Falcao had modelled his game on Crespo or been coached by the same people.

The reason is that he has those little darting runs that can get in behind defenders and which Crespo was so good at. They are a nightmare to defend against because of the speed and intelligence of the runs.

Falcao, though, probably has even more to his game that Crespo, in that he can start such runs from further out. In addition, he’s very strong and his muscular build will suit the Premier League.

Ability to adapt

Importantly, he can adapt. If you want to play into feet, he’s perfectly comfortable with that and if you want to hit balls over he top, he can run on to them. He can hold the ball up with his back to goal, he’s good in the air and his strike rate is excellent.

His finishing isn’t all about power, he has subtlety as well. You can see why I think he’s the complete package. It will be intriguing to see how Louis van Gaal fits him into the United side, though I suspect he will play up front with Robin van Persie, as Wayne Rooney could easily play in the position just behind them, the slot Juan Mata has been filling.

Fitness questions

The only question mark will be fitness, given that he has just recovered from cruciate knee ligament surgery. With the surgical advances for that type of injury, you would hope he hasn’t lost any speed or sharpness and can get back to his best.

I hope I haven’t scared our QPR defenders who will face him on Sunday. You can’t make a plan for someone like Falcao. Our defenders need to be playing at nine or 10 to contain him.

There’s no reason why they can’t do that and, from QPR’s perspective, let’s hope it will take him a game or two to adapt. Eventually, though, I’m confident we will see one of the best strikers in the world.
