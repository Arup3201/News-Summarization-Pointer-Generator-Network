A school girl who collapsed and suffered a cardiac arrest in the school playground has woken up after spending five months in a coma.

Emma Ross, 10, stopped breathing when her father came to collect her from school in February and was placed in a medically-induced coma.

The youngster, who woke up a few weeks ago, is now recovering from a pioneering operation to fit a pump to help her condition.

Emma is the first child to be fitted with a £27,000 Baclofen pump, having been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy - a disease of the heart muscle.

The device was fitted at Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow after a three-hour operation yesterday.

It will allow drugs to be injected directly into her spine, which will hopefully stop the painful involuntary muscle spasms, which Emma has endured.

Emma’s mother, Robyn Stewart, 32, said: ‘I was told so many times that she was not going to 
make it, but she has made so much progress. She is my wee miracle.

'Emma had her op and it all went well, so we are so relieved.

'The surgery is very rare, she will be the first child to have that type of pump fitted in the hospital.

‘We are now hoping that it will help relax her muscles so she will be able to move around because right now her muscles are so tight and stiff.

‘She is awake and aware of people. She can sometimes move her hands and feet. If a song comes on that she likes then she will move her feet around.

‘All I want is for her to talk and tell 
me how she feels.'

The 
schoolgirl from Dumfries stopped breathing for 44 minutes and turned 
blue when her father Lindsay, 36, came to collect her from Heathhall 
Primary in February.

Doctors
 battled to save her life at Dumfries Infirmary before she was rushed to
 Yorkhill Children’s Hospital in Glasgow and placed in a medically 
induced coma.

Ms Stewart has spoken of her fear at seeing her little girl lying ‘dead’ in the playground.

Cardiomyopathy is a disease of the heart muscle.

It can run in families and can affect one or many members of a family.

There are three different types of cardiomyopathy and each affects the size and shape of the heart.

They can also affect the heart's electrical system.

There is a small risk of sudden death in people with cardiomyopathy.

She said: ‘When I arrived I saw Emma lying dead and motionless. She was completely blue and she was not breathing. Her teacher Mrs Black was standing over her giving CPR.

‘Since then it has been an absolute roller-coaster, we’ve had good days and bad days. She can now make noises, grunts and groans.

‘There was a high risk with the operation as it took three hours - she could possibly have had another cardiac arrest.

‘I
 know she is going to pull through. She had a chance to leave me and she
 didn’t. Three times I was told she was not going to make it, but she is
 still fighting.’

Emma
 has now been diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, which is the same disease 
of the heart muscle that almost killed footballer Fabrice Muamba in 
2012.

She spent 
her 10th birthday in hospital last month, while she was barely 
conscious, but her party had to be cancelled because she urgently needed
 a feeding tube inserted in her stomach.

Her parents have been able to take Emma out of hospital in her wheelchair and her mum said she is always smiling.

They have another daughter called Evie who is 18 months old and say they have been ‘overwhelmed’ by the support and kindness of people who have read Emma’s story.

‘Folk have been brilliant. We have been absolutely overwhelmed with all the support,’ Ms Stewart said.

St Michael’s Church and donations from the public have enabled the family to stay near Emma in hospital.

They will be doing a 10k run on August 31 along with Emma’s friends and teachers to raise money for Ronald McDonald House, which is a charity that provides free accommodation for 500 families each year whose children are critically ill patients in Yorkhill Hospital.

People can sponsor Ms Stewart’s run by visiting her Just Giving page.

Contrary to popular belief, a cardiac arrest is not the same as a heart attack.

A cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly and unexpectedly stops beating due to a malfunction in its electrical system.

It is caused by an abnormal rhythm, or arrhythmia.

Anyone can suffer a cardiac arrest and it can happen at any time and without warning.

Symptoms include unresponsiveness, loss of consciousness, lack of pulse and stopping breathing.

In contrast, a heart attack can be thought of as a problem with the heart's plumbing - it occurs when an artery supplying the heart becomes blocked.

This causes the heart muscle to begin to die slowly while the patient usually remains awake and alert.
