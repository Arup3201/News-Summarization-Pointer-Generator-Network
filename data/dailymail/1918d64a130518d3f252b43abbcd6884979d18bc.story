David Cameron’s plan to enshrine an increase in foreign aid into law has been shelved, it emerged yesterday.

The Government is committed to fixing international development spending at 0.7 per cent of GDP, one of the highest levels in the Western world.

Increasing foreign aid is an article of faith for the Prime Minister, but he is opposed by many Tory MPs who want it cut.

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured today during an Q&A session in Derbyshire, has promised to pass the 0.7% target into law before the 2015 election

All three main parties signed up to the policy before the last election and the Tories and Lib Dems wrote it into the coalition agreement in 2010.

The Bill has been ready for more than a year, with ministers promising it will be introduced when time allows.

The rumoured omission will delight many Tory MPs who have called for rises in foreign aid to be curbed and protections lifted at a time when other areas such as defence and police are suffering budget cuts.

The Coalition’s Mid-Term Review, published in January, stated: ‘We have committed to increasing overseas aid to reach 0.7 per cent of Gross National Income from 2013.’

It would mean that future governments would have to change the law if they wanted to cut overseas aid below the United Nations target - met for the first time by the UK this year.

Chancellor George Osborne announced in last month's Budget that Britain would meet the target this year

But campaigners fear that a failure to include it in the Government's agenda for the year ahead announced by the Queen on May 8 would indicate a waning commitment to fulfil the promise by the end of this Parliament.

Mr Cameron's official spokesman today told a Westminster media briefing: ‘The position is as set out in the coalition agreement, which the mid-term review clearly restated. There is no change.’

The spokesman declined to comment on the contents of the Queen's Speech.

In last month’s Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said that the UK was already meeting its target without it being set down in law.

He told MPs: ‘We deliver in this coming year on this nation’s long-standing commitment to the world’s poorest to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on international development.

‘We should all take pride, as I do, in this historic achievement for our country. As previously, the DfID budget will be adjusted to ensure we don’t spend more than 0.7 per cent.’

Melanie Ward, head of advocacy at development charity ActionAid, said: ‘News that the Government may be dropping its long-standing commitment to legislate to spend 0.7% of national income on aid is extremely disappointing.

‘To do so would break the promise made by all three political parties at the last general election to the British people and to the poorest people in the world.

‘We know that aid is most effective when it is predictable and so the certainty provided by legislation is crucial. Now is the time to enshrine that commitment in law, not to back away.’

The row comes as International Development Secretary Justine Greening said more UK aid money must be spent on 'disaster proofing' earthquake-prone countries.

Today she visited British-funded projects in Haiti where a catastrophic tremor left 230,000 dead in 2010.

Miss Greening said Saturday's deadly quake in rural China which killed at least 200 people and injured more than 11,000 was a fresh reminder of the fact that natural disasters tend to 'hit the poorest hardest'.

Miss Greening said the UK could not just wait for the next natural disaster

She said: 'Britain is a world leader in humanitarian emergency response but it makes complete sense to invest in helping Haiti to take earthquakes and hurricanes in its stride.

As the devastating earthquake in China this weekend has shown, natural disasters hit the poorest hardest.

'There is no point in getting involved only when the latest catastrophe hits if we know that simple improvements to infrastructure and training people to consider the risks of natural events mean that the country's development is not wiped out every time a major disaster strikes.'

Miss Greening was in the Caribbean nation - one of the most natural disaster-prone on the planet - with former New Zealand prime minister and head of the United Nations Development Programme Helen Clark and UN Emergency Relief Co-ordinator Baroness Amos.

Britain has devoted £10 million to dealing with the aftermath of the Haiti earthquake - almost a quarter of the 1.5 million displaced people remain in camps -  and helping it prepare better for future disasters.

Miss Greening used the visit to announce a £300,000 project to provide legal support and counselling for up to 500 victims of rape and violence and build 'safe spaces' for up to 300 girls aged 10-14.

'Improved rights and safety for women is just one ingredient necessary for Haiti to have a social, physical and financial infrastructure able to withstand setbacks and to continue on its path to development and growth,' she said.

'Haiti can only have a bright future if Haitians of both genders play a full and confident role in building prosperity.'
