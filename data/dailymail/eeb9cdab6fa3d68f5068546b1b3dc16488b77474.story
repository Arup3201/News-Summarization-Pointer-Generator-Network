Margate, Slough and Clacton-on-Sea have been revealed as some of the most unlikely property hotspots in the country after new figures revealed them to have a booming housing market.

Daventry, Alfreton and Sutton-In-Ashfield, all in the East Midlands, have also been revealed as unlikely hotspots with sales of property rising by more than 50 per cent year-on-year.

The research, based on Land Registry data covering England and Wales, compared the number of property sales in the first 10 months of last year with those in the first 10 months of 2013.

Slough in Berkshire (pictured) also saw a surprise increase in property sales, recording a rise of 45 per cent

It revealed that 760,000 sales took place across the country between January and October last year, marking a 21 per cent increase on the same period in 2013.

As well as the East Midlands contingent, Pudsey in Yorkshire and the Humber and Wickford in the South East also saw an increase of more than 40 per cent in house sales.

Daventry in Northamptonshire saw the biggest year-on-year uplift with a 56 per cent rise in house sales, while Alfreton, in Derbyshire, saw a rise of 53 per cent.

Pudsey recorded an increase of 51 per cent in property sales while Sutton-in-Ashfield, in Nottinghamshire, saw a 50 per cent rise.

However, despite the overwhelming increase in house sales in several towns across England and Wales, many parts of London saw a year-on-year decline.

In further signs that the London market is cooling off, the capital saw a year-on-year decline in sales in more than one fifth of its boroughs.

Across London, there was an 11 per cent year-on-year increase in sales in 2014, which is the smallest uplift recorded across any region last year.

The report by Lloyds Bank said the finding fits with other studies showing that the London market has 'slowed sharply' since last summer.

London has driven much of the housing market recovery in recent years.

Looking back over the last five years, London has seen a larger pick-up in sales than any other region, with transactions in the capital lifting by 74 per cent between 2009 and 2014.

However, it was the East Midlands which saw the biggest year-on-year increase in house sales in 2014, recording a 26% upswing, according to the research. The West Midlands and the North West followed closely behind with a 25 per cent increase, while Yorkshire and the Humber saw a rise of 23 per cent.

Some towns even managed to record a higher number of property sales last year than in 2007, when Britain was at the height of the housing boom.

The 12 towns where sales were higher in 2014 than in 2007 were Biggleswade, Wallingford, Didcot, Alton and Romsey in the South East, St Neots in East Anglia, Hinckley in the East Midlands, Evesham, Droitwich and Malvern in the West Midlands and Melksham and Newquay in Cornwall.

Amersham, South East, minus 11%

Ealing, London, minus 10%

Leatherhead, South East, minus 5%

Southwark, London, minus 5%

Hammersmith/Fulham, London, minus 4%

Wallsend, North, minus 4% 

Islington, London, minus 2%

Stamford, East Midlands, minus 2%

Richmond upon Thames, London, minus 2%

Merton, London, minus 1%

Camden, London, minus 1%

Rickmansworth, South East, minus 1%

Meanwhile, Amersham in Buckinghamshire was found to be the town with the biggest fall in sales last year, with an 11 per cent decline.

It was followed by Ealing in West London, with a 10 per cent decline, and Leatherhead in Surrey which saw a five per cent drop.

Andy Hulme, mortgages director at Lloyds Bank, said: 'Low interest rates, improvements in the UK economy and Government schemes, such as Help to Buy, all appear to have contributed to the rise in home sales.

'There is a clear north versus south pattern to the housing market recovery, with sales closer to their 2007 levels in the south. Indeed, a small number of towns recorded higher sales last year than seven years earlier, but sales remained much lower than 2007 levels in most areas.'

A separate report released by property analysts Hometrack found that the strong property price growth will restrict the ability of prices to increase further in the medium term.

Hometrack said that average property prices in London and Oxford are now typically more than 12 times local annual earnings, which is almost double the UK average of 6.3 times wages.

Going forward, Hometrack expects to see the momentum behind the housing market shift towards cities such as Liverpool, Sheffield and Glasgow, which have been slower to see property prices recover. 

The number of property sales in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, have declined by 11 per cent since last year
