Tony Adams wants the current Arsenal squad to stop calling him ‘Mr Adams’. He wants to stop having to tell them how it feels to be a winner because none of them know. He wants them to start writing their own history, starting with lifting the FA Cup at Wembley.

It feels fitting that Adams is speaking at Repton Boxing Club in east London, in front of a black and white poster screaming ‘No Guts No Glory’.

He is incredulous that Arsenal could be stifled by the tag of favourites and seems equally unimpressed as he explains Arsene Wenger believes he has a squad capable of winning the Champions League.

But then Adams, as he puts it, ‘likes winning things’. The former Arsenal captain can look back on four League titles, three FA Cups and two League Cups between 1987 and 2002.

If his old club secure fourth place in the Barclays Premier League and the FA Cup this season it would only mean the campaign has ‘not been a failure; not like having to play in the Europa League like Tottenham’.

He adds: ‘None of this Arsenal team knows what it’s like to win a trophy for the club. Arsene remembers, but not these players.

‘I did a Q&A with some of the players the other week, and all the questions about winning were coming to me because they didn’t have the answers.

‘I was talking to Carl Jenkinson and Kieran Gibbs and I was telling them: “You need to know how it feels just to get over the line” because it’s a weird feeling.

‘It was normal for us to win games. I’m not so sure this group of players has that.

‘They call me Mr Adams and stuff! I’m not sure I ever called older players “Mister”.

‘I want them to be pushing me to the side and ripping my statue down and make their own history.

‘They’re lovely guys, but they need leadership. Mikel Arteta’s a good pro without being, for me, a great player, but he will say “come on”.

‘(Per) Mertesacker’s been more verbal this year. I had a go at Per at the beginning of the season and said: “You don’t have to be Mr Nice Guy, you don’t have to be liked.” You don’t just go through your career letting it go by and missing the moment.’

Adams believes Wenger had ‘10 easy years’ in his first decade at Arsenal, having inherited that famous back five and an ‘unbelievable squad’ of players ‘ready to be taught’.

The 47-year-old thinks the Frenchman should sign a new contract at the club, regardless of the outcome at Wembley, but disagrees with Wenger’s optimism about the potential of his squad to win Europe’s most glittering prize.

‘I think Arsene really wants to win the Champions League,’ says Adams, ‘and I think he still thinks this group of players can do it for him. While he’s still got that belief, he’ll stick around.

‘If he thought that this squad couldn’t win him the Champions League I think he’d move on to Barcelona or a club that would deliver that for him before he goes to Paris Saint-Germain.

‘Do I share that optimism? No, I don’t. I don’t think the full backs are good enough. They’ve really struggled this year.

‘But I think Arsene should stay. I think, financially, he does fantastic for the club and there’s a great structure in place and better the devil you know.

‘He came in to take over an unbelievable squad, with an untapped French market, and he found a captain who had sobered up six weeks ago and was ready to grab life, instead of grabbing a pint, so a lot of his circumstances are to do with timing.

‘When the teacher appeared, that team was ready to run. I think he had 10 easy years, really.’

In conjunction with The European Azerbaijan Society and to mark World Refugee Week, Tony Adams is promoting a gala charity boxing night at York Hall, East London, on Friday 27th June. Tickets are available at www.Repton-Gabala.eventbrite.co.uk and proceeds will go to the Mo Farah Foundation.
