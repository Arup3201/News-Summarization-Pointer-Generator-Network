George Zimmerman is all but broke and will ask the court to pay for his legal defense, his attorney claims -- despite the fact that the 28-year-old has raised nearly $250,000 through his website.

Defense lawyer Mark O'Mara made the remarkable claim at a press conference on Monday, where he said months of death threats have forced Zimmerman and his wife to blow through most of their cash on security and day-to-day living expenses.

Mr O'Mara also said the former neighborhood watch volunteer will not use the 'stand your ground' defense in the killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in February -- opting instead for a traditional self defense claim.

Zimmerman's lawyer will ask the judge to declare him indigent -- a legal term that means he cannot afford the cost of his own defense.

He $50,000 left from his donations and about $20,000 in outstanding bills, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

'He really has to live as a hermit, unfortunately,' Mr O'Mara said. 'He's not doing well. He's getting by.'

The defense lawyer said he has been paid 'zero' by Zimmerman and will represent him for free.

However, Zimmerman still needs to cover the cost of expert witnesses, court transcripts and a private investigator.

Court records show money has poured into a PayPal account that Zimmerman set up to raise money for his legal defense. In April, he raised $1,000 a day and $64,000 on its best day.

Donations have since slowed to a trickle. An interview with Fox News commentator Sean Hannity and the roll out of a new website haven't increased the cash flow.

The case, Zimmerman's shooting of an unarmed black teenager at a gated community in Sanford, Florida, set off a national debate about race, self-defense and gun laws.

Zimmerman claims he killed Trayvon only after he was attacked by him and feared for his life. Supporters say he has been the target of thousands of death threats and massive unwanted media attention.

Prosecutors argue Zimmerman followed Trayvon because he was black and then murdered him.

Since the shooting, O'Mara said, Zimmerman has been forced to flee his home and hide out in an undisclosed location.

This has meant he and his wife can't work and must live off of the legal defense fund donations, Mr O'Mara said.

Court records show he and his wife spent $135,000 on car payments, credit card bills, cell phones, cable Internet and bulletproof vests.

The announcement about Zimmerman's financial problems comes after Mr O'Mara announced he would not employ the infamous 'stand your ground' defense.'

He said looking at the case through traditional self-defense circumstances is appropriate because the facts suggest his client couldn't retreat from a beating he was receiving from Martin.

'The facts don't seem to support a `stand your ground' defense,' O'Mara said on Monday.

Still, he did say that the defense team will try to get the case dismissed during a `stand your ground' hearing.

'My concern with even calling it a "stand your ground" hearing is we need to be more realistic,' O'Mara said.

Â 'I've said from Day 1 we need to wait until all the evidence comes out.'

O'Mara said he thinks people have a perception about the law that isn't accurate.

'People look at `stand your ground' and immediately think somebody's standing there with deadly force - be it a gun or a weapon - and having the opportunity to back up but not having the need to under the statute,' he said.

'I think the evidence in this case suggests that my client was reacting to having his nose broken and reacted to that by screaming out for help.

'He wasn't in position where I think there was any suggestion where he could retreat, which he is allowed to do under the statute.'

If a judge were to side with Zimmerman in a pre-trial hearing under the state's self-defense statute, the murder charge would be dismissed immediately.
