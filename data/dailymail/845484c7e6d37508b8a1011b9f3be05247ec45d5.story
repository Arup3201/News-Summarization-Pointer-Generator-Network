Managers have a habit of talking up the opposition, especially after they have won. It’s not a particularly subtle way of amplifying your own team’s qualities. Clearly if the side you have beaten are excellent, then that only magnifies your own achievement.

So when Cesare Prandelli praised England at the end his 2-1 win over them on Saturday night, the warm words had to be filtered through a more cynical prism. And yet, even given that proviso, it is worth recording what he said.

‘We know England have changed a lot in the last few years,’ said Prandelli. ‘They used to play with long balls and headers. Now England are very good playing in triangles and one on one. They really have one the strongest attacks in the World Cup. I’ve been really consistent in what I’ve been saying: we played against a great team.’

Praise: Cesare Prandelli, celebrating Italy's win on Saturday, says England are a great team

Perhaps he was ladling it on a little 
by the end. England are not a great side but they do have the potential 
to be a good one. It is Prandelli’s line about England playing in 
triangles that perhaps offers the most encouragement.

It wasn’t just 
about the speed of England on Saturday night, which, should they 
progress, will surely worry any side they face. They actually moved the 
ball nicely at times, engineering their way out of tight spaces with 
neat passing.

It’s not the 
first time England have done it. Foreign coaches once were similarly 
complementary about the improvements that Terry Venables and Glenn 
Hoddle had made to England’s style but progressive football was somehow 
abandoned once the expensive foreign imports took over the reins of 
management. It seems it takes an English coach to believe English 
players can actually play a little: Sven Goran Eriksson and Fabio 
Capello never seemed to trust them to do so.

Too
 often at World Cups England have been like the unwanted drunken guest, 
stumbling over tables and embarrassing everyone with their inappropriate
 aggression. On Saturday, in a World Cup that has sparkled so far, 
England behaved like part of the in-crowd at the party, entertaining and
 impressing.

Net gains: Sturridge throws his arms in the air in celebration after scoring at the end of a free-flowing move

True, they 
lost, a not inconsiderable draw back. But most would take defeat in this
 manner over the 0-0 abject draw with Algeria in Cape Town in 2010; or 
the laboured victories over Paraguay and Trinidad and Tobago in 2006.

Who
 would have known that Roy Hodgson had been repressing these attacking 
instincts? Like a suburban bank manager who indulges a secret passion 
for clubbing at the weekends, he indulged every populist call in 
deploying Raheem Sterling from the start, refusing to kowtow to Wayne 
Rooney and in bringing on Ross Barkley.

A
 few Liverpool fans might be bemused by the manager England have 
employed. He would argue that he didn’t have these players at Anfield.
 Yet on Saturday night, England seemed to play with freedom, as though 
they embracing the challenge rather enduring it.

Populist: Roy Hodgson made some big calls against Italy and they very nearly came off

Not
 that the game was without issues. Ultimately England’s failure to pick 
up Claudio Marchisio for Italy’s first goal was inexplicable in a team 
managed by Hodgson, who is so meticulous on his team shape and player 
responsibilities. Good though Andrea Pirlo’s dummy was, Marchisio had a 
free strike. It was a goal that was easily prevented. And Leighton 
Baines won’t relish the re-runs of Antonio Candreva turning him the 
wrong way to deliver the deep, looping cross for Mario Balotelli to 
score.

And then there is 
Rooney. Hodgson defended him on Saturday night and it is true that 
for long periods he performed in his required role as well as delivering
 a superb cross for Daniel Sturridge’s goal. ‘We wanted to get Sterling around Pirlo because of his agility and of course that 
meat moving Wayne Rooney and I thought that worked well,’ said Hodgson.

Questions: Uncertainty surrounds Wayne Rooney following his patchy display against Italy

‘He
 set up the goal for us, he worked very hard and did well also when we 
brought him back into the centre. There’s always going to be one player 
who there’s a big debate around but I think it’s very harsh to criticise
 Rooney’s performance today because for me he played well.’

That
 said, Sturridge, Welbeck and Sterling played better. The debate for 
Uruguay now boils down to whether Rooney is better than Adam Lallana? As
 an attacking threat he is and as such he starts in a game England must 
win.

However, it might be argued that Lallana would have have dealt with
 full back Matteo Darmian better and would have had the energy to offer 
greater protection to Baines. Significantly, Hodgson felt the need to 
switch Welbeck to the left at half time, to curtail the Italian right 
back – though he still popped up providing the pass for Candreva’s cross
 and Balotelli’s goal.

Coming in? Adam Lallana might not be a better attacking option than Rooney but he knows the position

And 
then there is the small matter of defeat. Under Eriksson and Capello 
England often looked awful; but they didn’t lose in World Cup group 
stages, though Eriksson did in his first game in Euro 2004 to France. 
England could be figuratively packing their bags on Thursday, slipping 
out of the party before the real dancing begins, returning home after 
briefly dazzling. It doesn’t feel like that, however.

Not
 since 1998 and the honourable exit against Argentina on penalties has 
defeat felt this good. The national mood won’t feel quite so generous if
 the result is the same on Thursday; but if the performance is repeated,
 there is little chance that it will be.
