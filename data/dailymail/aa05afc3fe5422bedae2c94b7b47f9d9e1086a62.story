Timothy Porter has been jailed for 18 months for degrading a woman who he put under his trance, telling her he was her master and she was his sex slave

A self-taught hypnotist has been jailed for degrading a woman who he put under his trance, telling her he was her master and she was his sex slave.

Instead of using hypnotherapy to help his vulnerable victim with weight-loss and anxiety issues, ex-RAF man Timothy Porter made the woman touch her breasts while he committed a sex act on himself.

The grandfather, who had an unblemished record in the services spanning 24 years, has now been jailed for 18 months at Teesside Crown Court.

The 40-year-old had previously pleaded guilty to causing a person to engage in sexual activity without their consent.

Jonathan Walker, prosecuting, said Porter, who served at RAF Leeming in North Yorkshire until the end of 2012, learned hypnosis and offered to carry out hypnotherapy on the married mother, whose identity cannot be reported.

After a series of sessions, Porter turned up at her home on the night of December 2 last year when her husband was away.

Despite her reservations, Porter offered to hypnotise her more deeply than before and the pair sat on a sofa.

'He kept saying, "No mind, no will of your own",' Mr Walker said.

She became frightened but the session continued. Mr Walker said: 'The defendant stated he was her master, she was his sexual slave.'

The amateur hypnotist then persuaded her to expose and touch her breasts while he performed a sex act on himself.

She was roused from the hypnosis and went to the kitchen, the court heard, and Porter tried to restart the session, without success.

Instead, his upset victim rang a friend, police were called and he was arrested.

Mr Walker said: 'His account was that he believed she was consenting to his actions during the course of this incident.

'He agreed the incident had escalated and he misread the situation.'

Mr Walker said the victim was deeply upset.

'It has had a profound effect on her sleeping pattern and her general health,' he said.

She had declined Porterâ€™s offer on previous occasions to use hypnotherapy to achieve more intense orgasms.

Jon Gregg, defending, said: 'Sad it is to see a man who has served his country proudly for so many years in so many active operations in the dock at a crown court staring down the barrel of a custodial sentence.'

Recorder Tim Gittins said the defendant was of good character, adding: 'You worked for Queen and country and undertook a number of arduous tours abroad.'

Porter was jailed for 18 months, placed on the sex offenders register for 10 years and banned from contacting his victim and from acting as a hypnotist for 10 years at Teesside Crown Court (pictured)

He continued: 'Regrettably one of your recent hobbies or interests in recent years is to be engaged in an amateur way in hypnotherapy and hypnotism.

'You have had no formal training and it is of concern that you engaged in such activity with a number of females without learning anything of the dangers or restrictions.'
