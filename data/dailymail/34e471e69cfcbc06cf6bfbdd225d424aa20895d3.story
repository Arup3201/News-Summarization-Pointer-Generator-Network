A clothing firm which went from making  jackets for fishermen to become a fashion brand worn by royalty is locked in a bitter dispute with its workers.

J Barbour and Sons Ltd - which makes the famous waxed jackets and Wellington boots loved by A-list celebrities - is facing strike action by more than 100 workers in the North East.

The dispute is over what unions claim are forced changes to staff contracts, including the removal of the unsocial hours payment and the introduction of a requirement to work until 11pm.

The Barbour jacket has become a mainstay in the wardrobes of the British establishment and is often worn by royalty including The Duchess of Cambridge and The Queen. The firm's workers are now threatening a strike

The company's clothes, as worn by Lily Allen (left) and Billie Piper (right), have gone from being a niche product for fishermen and motorcyclists to a fashion success story which has graced the world's catwalks

The company made profits of £21.5million last year from total sales of £152million around the world, as demand soared after a glittering array of celebrities and royals were spotted in the jackets. 

But Unite union say staff at the company have been told to sign up to a change of contract or face the sack. Its members now plan to strike on every morning from January 5 to January 30.

It follows a six-day stoppage earlier this month over the dispute which centres on the firm's warehouses in Wardley, Gateshead, and involves 134 of its 600 North East workers. 

Unite regional officer Fazia Hussain-Brown said: 'Barbour's "sign or be sacked" ultimatum is bullying and anti-family.

'Many of the workers struggling to get by on less than the living wage are the sole bread-winner and have family or caring responsibilities.

'For a company that prides itself on "family values" to seek to railroad through cuts and unsocial changes to their contracts is hypocrisy of the highest order.' 

Since taking control of the firm in the 1970s, Dame Margaret Barbour has revolutionised the company's image

But as demand soars due to endorsements from celebrities inlcuding Alexa Chung (left) and Holly Willoughby (right), workers at one of the firm's factory's say they are being forced to work later shifts

The union representing workers says they are being forced to sign contracts which restrict their pay

Ms Hussain-Brown added: 'The company should not underestimate the resolve of the workforce nor the impact that four weeks of strike action will have on supplies.

'Barbour management need to live up to the company's 'family- friendly' values and negotiate a fair deal for its workforce.'

Barbour has been a successful family-run company for 120 years, and its famous wax jackets are a favourite with showbusiness stars and the British Royal Family.

They are sold at prestigious stores including Harrods, Harvey Nichols and John Lewis.

Brenda Readman-Bell, Barbour's group finance and IT director, has said the company has 'done everything' to work with the union.

The clothing, worn by Princess Diana and her son Prince William, has received three separate royal warrants

Barbour is now a major fashion brand and the company made profits of £21.5million from sales of £152million. The jacket modelled in this fashion shoot sells for nearly £400

She said previously: 'Barbour is a North East success story – a global premium lifestyle brand sold in over 40 countries worldwide.

'Our business has grown significantly and in a very competitive retail market place, service and on time deliveries to our customers are of paramount importance.'

She added: 'The introduction of shift patterns will enable us to extend the warehouse working hours in order to satisfy customer demand and to continue to deliver the high standard and quality of service that Barbour is renowned for.

'We have been in consultation with the union since May 2014 and we feel we have done everything possible to work with the union and our employees to alleviate their concerns.

'The introduction of new shift patterns includes a substantial pay increase and standard working hours on a Monday-to- Friday basis.'

Barbour was founded in 1894 by Scotsman John Barbour in South Shields near Newcastle. He made waterproof, oilcloth coats which were originally popular among fishermen.

The success of the coats meant that, in 1908, John's son Malcolm produced the firm's first mail order catalogue, which brought in orders from places as far-flung as Chile and Hong Kong.

Barbour became J Barbour & Sons Ltd in 1912, when founder John made his sons Jack and Malcolm the Managing Directors.

The company was founded by Scotsman John Barbour, who started selling jacked in South Shields in 1894

The company has been passed down through five generations of the same family since it started in 1894

Founder John died in 1918 and the company was passed on to Jack, who was in charge until 1927, when he resigned, handing control to Malcolm, whose son Duncan then joined the firm in 1928.

Duncan was a keen motorcyclist and introduced a range for bikers, which for decades became the favourite brand of motorcycle racing teams.

He was later called to serve in the Second World War and his father Malcolm, still chairman of the business, and Duncan's wife Nancy, took over the firm.

In 1936, the captain of the HMS Ursula submarine, George Philips, commissioned a suit for his crew as he was unhappy with the Navy kit. The Barbour ‘Ursula’ then became standard issue in WWII.

In 1957, the company built a plant in the Simonside Trading Estate on the outskirts of South Shields.

Barbour moved to Simonside in the early 1980s, close to where the first factory was in South Shield

The company has insisted changes to workers' shifts are needed to keep the business competitive

Actor Steve McQueen liked the brand so much he picked up one of their motorcycling jackets on his way to international motorcycling trials in 1964. He now has a collection in his name.

In the same year as the trials, Malcolm Barbour died aged 83 and his daughter-in-law Nancy became chairman.

Duncan and Nancy's son John, who joined the firm in 1957, died in 1968 while managing director. His wife Margaret joined the board and became chairman five years later.

She has overseen a huge expansion in demand for the company's clothes, which received their first royal warrant in 1974. It has since received two more. 

Margaret was made a Dame in 2001 and named Vogue's inspirational 'Wonder Women' in 2011. 

In 2013, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Institute of Directors.

Dame Margaret's daughter Helen continued the family lineage to the fifth generation when she became Vice Chairman of the company in 1997.

In 1981, Barbour moved to a new factory in Simonside, where many of its products are still made.
