It was an elaborate marriage proposal which began with a single rose.

Baseball player Shay Crawford led his girlfriend Stephanie Silvers on a secret scavenger hunt through Chattanooga, Tennessee, which ended with what many women dream about: a wedding ring.

A heartmelting video shows just how Crawford managed to woo his sweetheart with the help of family members.

In love: Shay Crawford got down on bended knee to propose to Stephanie Silvers in front of their elated family members

'Family is incredibly important to both 
of us,' Crawford shared with Inside Edition.

'They were very, very excited when they heard I was going to 
propose. I just wanted to include everybody, I thought it would be 
really special that way.'

The well-planned proposal began when Silvers met her mother near a church. She handed her daughter a single rose and read a letter Crawford had written, before sending Silvers to the next destination.

With family members filming the journey, Silvers went to Ruthâ€™s Chris Steakhouse 
- Crawford's 'personal favorite' - where his mother was waiting.

The emotional woman cried and read Silvers a moving letter before directing her future daughter-in-law to a gym facility.

Silvers met her brother at the Rush gym, followed by her father and Crawford's sister, and then on to AT&T Field, where Crawford's dad was waiting.

Crawford plays minor league 
baseball for the Tampa Bay Rays, so the stadium was a special place for the 
couple.

But it wasn't until Silvers walked across Walnut Street Bridge in Chattanooga, towards the end of the journey, that she sensed a proposal was coming.

'It all caught me so unaware. It wasn't until I was walking 
across the bridge and I thought, 'Shay is about to be here. This is 
about to happen!',' Silvers told Inside Edition.

Then, surrounded by family, Crawford dropped to one knee and proposed to the love of his life. She said yes.
