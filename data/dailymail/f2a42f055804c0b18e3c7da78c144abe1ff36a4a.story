On a night when they were cheered from the stands at Ibrox by one of the track stars of Glasgow 2014, Rangers finally got their season off-and-running.

Yet while the pre-match presence of Lynsey Sharp - a lifelong Rangers fan and Commonwealth Games silver medallist in the 800metres - proved a catalyst for Ally McCoist’s men roaring out of the blocks early, his team ultimately and disappointingly limped over the line against a Hibs side who finished this Petrofac Training Cup tie with 10 men.

Indeed, had Alan Stubbs’ frontmen remembered to pack their shooting boots, they could easily have added to McCoist’s roll of dishonour in knockout competitions since he took over from Walter Smith in 2011.

Swish! Nicky Law curled in wonderfully as Rangers beat Alan Stubb's Hibernian in extra-time at Ibrox

Pride: Commonwealth Games silver medallist Lynsey Sharp was at the game to cheer the Gers on 

After young Danny Handling had cancelled out Lewis Macleod’s fine first-half goal, Sam Stanton missed a sitter before Farid El Alagui squandered two fabulous chances to deny Alan Stubbs what would have been a tremendous start to his new job at Hibs.

There was to be further frustration for the visitors when Handling was red-carded for a foul on David Templeton, Nicky Law making sure Rangers’ numerical advantage counted by striking the goal that finally saw off Hibs. It also teed up an intriguing Ibrox date later this month against a Clyde side managed by Ibrox legend Barry Ferguson.

Despite an ultimately satisfying scoreline for Rangers, this was another stuttering performance by McCoist’s side on a night when the attendance at Ibrox was a worrying 18,138 for a clash between two teams destined to battle it out with Hearts for the Scottish Championship title.

Whether that was down to the lack of allure of the Petrofac Training Cup - the recently re-branded Challenge Cup - or symptomatic of the strained relationship between the rank-and-file Rangers fans and the club’s board remains to be seen.

It had all started so promisingly for McCoist, whose returning strike duo of Kenny Miller and Kris Boyd were cheered to the rafters by the home crowd. For Miller, it was 14 years to the day since his very first Rangers goal, the winner in a 3-2 thriller at Rugby Park.

There were warm Ibrox welcomes, too, for fellow new signings Marius Zaliukas and Darren McGregor, who joined captain Lee McCulloch at the back in a 3-5-2 formation that the manager had road-tested in North America.

Stubbs, meanwhile, gave debuts to goalkeeper Mark Oxley, full back David Gray and striker El Alagui. His fourth summer signing Scott Allan - a previous Rangers target - had to settle for a place on the bench.

Boyd nearly made a dream start to his second Ibrox debut when his volley flew into the side netting, causing some within Ibrox to rise in celebration. But the former Kilmarnock striker had been flagged offside. It was to be a recurring theme.

Rangers made a deserved breakthrough, however, when Lee Wallace floated a great ball towards Macleod at the far side of the box. The Scotland under-21 midfielder cushioned the ball perfectly before thumping a superb finish low beyond Oxley.

Macleod has now clearly recovered from a virus that attacked his internal organs and led him to miss the first six months of the year. On this form, the 20-year-old is going to be a big player for Rangers this season.

All smiles: Manager Ally McCoist joins in the celebrations after Law notched the winner 

McCoist’s team were comfortable at that point and Boyd thought he had doubled the lead from 18 yards, but this time he was denied by referee John Beaton who ruled he had controlled the ball with his hand in the build-up.

It was clear that Stubbs had Hibs playing a more pleasing passing game than under predecessor Terry Butcher but the same old lack of creativity and penetration remained a problem. However, the Edinburgh side were a team transformed after the break.

Stubbs should have had his first competitive goal to cheer when Sam Stanton was played in on goal by Liam Craig but he fluffed an excellent chance. His weak shot, straight at Cammy Bell, was as threatening as a pass back.

Hibs grabbed the goal their play merited when Zaliukas lost the ball and Handling made Rangers pay for their shambolic defencing by slotting the ball under the outrushing Bell. El Alagui should then have put Hibs ahead but he volleyed a Craig chip over the bar from 16 yards with just Bell to beat.

McCoist moved to a regular back four when he sent on winger Templeton for McGregor in a bid to inject creativity into his team.

Flased an effort wide: Hibernian's Farid El Alagui fails to convert a chance from close range

But it was El Alagui who missed another fine opportunity when he headed an Alex Harris corner over from close range.

Then came the game-changing moment when Handling went in hard on Templeton, drawing a red card from John Beaton that looked, at first glance, questionable.

A man to the good and having perked up a little, Rangers saw a penalty claim turned down by Beaton after Gray held Lee Wallace in the box.

So into extra time we went, and only 11 minutes had elapsed when the hammer blow came for Hibs.

After Hibs midfielder Scott Robertson fell to the ground with cramp, Wallace cleverly capitalised on the extra space - driving into the box before cutting back for Law who curled the ball beautifully into the far corner.

Rangers fan Lynsey Sharp would have been relieved to see that Hibs’ race was now run.

Despite being given an almighty fright, her beloved Rangers remain in the hunt for silverware and the chance to avenge the hurt of last season’s final defeat to Raith Rovers.
