An overweight mother has revealed she was inspired to shed six stone after suffering a humiliating wake-up call during a visit to the fairground.

Lee Gentleman, 34, saw her weight rise to 15st after binging on an unhealthy diet of takeaways, crisps and chocolate.

She finally realised she had to take action when she was unable to stretch a safety strap across herself and her four-year-old son during a family funfair trip.

Shame: Lee with her son Oliver, then four, on holiday in Scarborough in 2012. It was then that Lee was humiliated at the fair when she could not fasten her seatbelt on a ride

Biggest: Lee says she was ashamed when she looked back at her holiday photos and found she was the fattest of all her family. Lee managed to lose 6st after joining Slimming World and turning her diet around

Now, a year later, Lee has managed to successfully turned her diet around and weighs just 9st 2lbs.

She said: 'That summer was one of the worst I had ever had.

'I was at my heaviest point and we were in Scarborough for a family holiday. I went on a ride with my son but I couldn't get the seat belt around the two of us.

'I was totally embarrassed, it was a horrible situation. I was also looking back at pictures from when I went to Blackpool with my mum and cousins. I was the biggest in every single photo.'

Lee, from Biggar, South Lanarkshire, joined Slimming World and quickly changed her diet and exercise habits after her embarrassing rollercoaster experience.

She decided to change job, moving from a call centre to working in a shop in her hometown, which made her more active and allowed her to plan meals.

Transformation: Lee says she can now run around after her children, Oliver six, and Calvin, three (pictured here with son Calvin, then two)

Lee said: 'I went from just sitting there to constantly moving about and serving people which made a difference.

'Before, I never had fruit and if I had any veg it would be fried. I had a lot of takeaways, at least two a week.

'My husband and I used to love getting a huge donor kebab, with everything in it, between us.

'Now I can still have one Chinese a week, usually boiled rice with beef and black bean sauce.

'I hardly ever exercised before and I always made excuses but now I walk for miles with the dog.

'I take the kids out cycling once a week if the weather is all right and I've started playing tennis and badminton, as well as going swimming on a Sunday.

'It was easy to stick to and has made such a difference. Life in general has improved. I'm in my hometown now and I can plan things a lot more.

Moderation: 'I used to have a lot of takeaways. Now I still have a Chinese once a week, but I'll have boiled rice with beef and black bean sauce,' says Lee

'I used to get to the top of the stairs and be knackered and even bending down to tie my shoelaces was difficult.

'I love it now that I can put my feet up and paint my nails without having to get into an awkward position. I'm flexible now.'

Lee's transformation has stunned husband Ian, 39, and sons Oliver, six, and three-year-old Calvin.

Her change in appearance has been so dramatic that most of her friends have struggled to recognise her.

She added: 'I feel amazing. I never imagined I would get down to the weight I am now.

'It is phenomenal. Sometimes I still feel like I'm big until I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and realise it isn't a dream.

'I can run about after my kids and I don't feel like the biggest person at the school gates.

'I still go to classes every week. I wouldn't miss them for the world.'
