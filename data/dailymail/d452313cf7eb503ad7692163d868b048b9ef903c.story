Emotional phone messages in which Home Secretary David Blunkett told his married lover that she was ‘breaking his heart’ were intercepted, recorded and stored by the News of the World, a court heard yesterday.

Tapes of the ‘deeply personal and intrusive’ voicemails – taken from the hacked phone of Mr Blunkett’s lover Kimberly Quinn, with whom he had a three-year affair – were found hidden in a safe, the Old Bailey was told.

Police investigating phone hacking at the tabloid discovered 330 messages from Mr Blunkett and associates.

Heartbreak: In the messages, Mr Blunkett was said to have repeatedly declared his love for Ms Quinn as she tried to break off their affair

In some, Mr Blunkett asked Mrs Quinn,
 the then publisher of the Spectator magazine, not to end their 
relationship, which is thought to have begun in 2001.

In
 one recording the Labour politician says: ‘You are breaking my heart.’ 
In others, he tells Mrs Quinn, now 52, that he ‘yearns’ and ‘longs’ for 
her.

Referring to messages 
left on July 19, 2004, Andrew Edis, QC, prosecuting, said: ‘There are 
messages in which Mr Blunkett expresses his love. She was ending the 
affair and he was distressed about it.’

Mrs
 Quinn’s voicemail messages also included ones left by Simon Hoggart, a 
Guardian journalist and contributor to The Spectator, with whom she was 
also said to be having an affair.

One
 bundle of tapes were found at the house of the News of the World’s 
private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, and another duplicate set was in 
the safe of the tabloid’s legal manager Tom Crone, the court heard.

Also
 in the safe was a draft article by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck, 
who nicknamed Mr Blunkett ‘Noddy’ and his lover ‘Big Ears’.

The article claims Mr Blunkett was left ‘devastated’ when Mrs Quinn ended their affair in 2004.

In
 his draft for a story that the News of the World ran on August 15, 
2004, exposing their affair, Thurlbeck wrote: ‘Noddy and Big Ears have 
been having an affair since July 2001. The exact date it started is to 
be pinned down.

‘In a 
message left at 11.48am on July 22, 2004, Noddy says, “I just yearn for 
you. It was a very different meal and a very different journey to this 
exact Thursday three years ago. Oh, what can happen in three years. I 
still long for you though”.

‘We are supposing that July 22, 2004, is the third anniversary of their meeting, having dinner, kiss etc.’

Blunkett and Ms Quinn, the publisher of the Spectator Magazine, were accused by the News of the World in August 2004 of having a three-year affair, printed after Coulson confronted the senior politician

Thurlbeck
 went on: ‘Reading the message, they are clearly splitting up after a 
three-year affair. This has been instigated by Big Ears. Noddy is 
devastated and is seeking a meeting as soon as possible. He is at an 
address of a country home .

‘She
 is about to leave for another place in the country. I have a possible 
address for her there and we have bikes and cars on her round the 
clock.’

Thurlbeck’s memo 
revealed that reporters were carrying out extensive surveillance on the 
couple: ‘There is a meeting scheduled for Wednesday August 11 AM. No 
further details on where. But if it is brought forward, we are in a good
 position to catch it.’

The court heard several drafts of the expose on Mr Blunkett's affair drafted by chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck were found in the safe

A few days after the News of the World exclusive about their affair, The Sun ran a story revealing that Mrs Quinn was pregnant.

The
 court also heard that Thurlbeck, who has admitted phone hacking, 
suspected Mrs Quinn had a third suitor at the time known only as Mr X.

But
 his memo suggested she was giving the ‘cold shoulder’ to the mystery 
man, who had a long-term partner, so he was not pursued by the tabloid.

The
 then editor of the paper, Andy Coulson, confronted Mr Blunkett about 
the fling before the story was printed. In a tape of a meeting played to
 the jury, Coulson said: ‘People know about this affair. I’m not saying 
it’s an open secret, but people are aware of it.’ Mr Blunkett refused to
 confirm or deny it as his private life was ‘not fair game’.

The court heard phone records showed that on that day Coulson was in contact with Rebekah Brooks, then the editor of The Sun.

It
 was also said Mr Blunkett’s hacked voicemails included one about a 
party he went to hosted by Mrs Brooks to celebrate her then husband Ross
 Kemp’s 40th birthday.

Brooks and Coulson, both 45, deny conspiring with others to hack phones.

The case continues.

England boss Sven Goran Eriksson refused to use mobile phones to contact his secret lover because he believed his phones were being tapped, the Old Bailey heard today.

The Swede told lover Faria Alam of his fears and would only call her using a landline towards the end of their affair.

Ms Alam said in a statement read to the jury: ‘We were in contact until July 2005, but it was done by landline telephone because Sven believe his telephone had been tapped.’

This came after a torrent of publicity of their affair sparked by a News of the World expose allegedly fueled by phone hacking.

The Old Bailey was told that Sven Goran Eriksson, pictured appearing on This Morning today, had his phone hacked by the News Of The World for almost his entire time as England manager

The court heard The News of the World hacked into his voicemails and stumbled on him being offered a place on Italy’s version of Big Brother.

The 65-year-old admitted being tempted by the reality TV when he quit as manager of the national team in summer 2006.

The alleged hacking of Eriksson's phone in 2004 happened in the run up to the NoTW expose of his affair with FA secretary Miss Alam

Glenn Mulcaire, a private 
investigator for the News of the World, had a recording of the message, 
left in Italian, when his flat was raided by police in August 2006.

The Old Bailey heard this was key evidence to prove Mr Eriksson had been a hacking target for the disgraced tabloid paper.

It is alleged Mr Eriksson was hacked repeatedly between 2004 and 2006 by Muclaire, including on the eve of the first game of the 2006 World Cup.

The alleged hacking of Eriksson’s phone in 2004 happened in the run up to the NoTW expose of his affair with FA secretary Miss Alam.

In her statement to the court, Ms Alam confirmed her address, phone number, and voicemail PIN numbers were in Mulcaire’s notes.

She told the court: ‘In my first week at the FA, England coach Sven Goran Eriksson started to pursue me.

‘Eventually I went to lunch with him at Kettner’s restaurant. We went there three times and Sven would have us dine in a private dining room.

‘I was impressed, I would sat at the office I was going for a long lunch.’

She said the affair continues with romps at Eriksson’s home in Regent’s Park and became ‘more intense’.

When the football coach returned from Euro 2004, he was told the Italian media knew of the affair.

‘I freaked out’, she said. ‘I told him to leave me and don’t make contact.’

Faria Alam received £300,000 to sell her story to two Sunday newspapers, a jury has been told.

Alam began an affair with Eriksson while working as a secretary at the FA and the Old Bailey has heard 'first details' emerged when the News of the World hacked their phones.

After she was fired because of the relationship in September 2004, publicist Max Clifford cut a deal for the News of the World and Mail on Sunday to give her £150,000 each for her side of the story, the court heard.
