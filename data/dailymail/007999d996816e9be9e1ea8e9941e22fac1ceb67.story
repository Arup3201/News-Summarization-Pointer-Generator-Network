Emma White, 36, was dancing along to the Wii programme when she lost control of her bladder

A mother has credited her Wii console with saving her life after it alerted her to symptoms of cervical cancer.

Emma White, from Faversham, Kent, was dancing along to the Wii programme when she lost control of her bladder.

The 36-year-old was celebrating her daughter’s birthday on Boxing Day last year when the embarrassing incident happened.

Concerned because she had never experienced incontinence before, Ms White went to see her GP, who found she was bleeding from her cervix

Within a week, tests revealed the mother-of-six had cervical cancer.

A scan revealed she had a tumour the size of an egg sitting on the cervical 
wall - and this was pushing against her bladder.

Ms White said: 'I was devastated - I have six children to care for.

'I knew something was wrong when I wet myself, I’d never experienced incontinence in the past.

'I’d also suffered from irregular periods, so after months of putting it off, I decided to go to my GP.

'Thankfully it took just six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy before a scan showed my tumour had completely gone.'

Ms White first blamed her tell-tale signs of cervical cancer - such as irregular periods - on recently having given birth to daughter Everlyn-Ray in March 2013.

The former nursery practitioner said: 'My partner Gary and I were over the moon when we found out I was pregnant with Everlyn.

'But my labour was different this time and my cervix didn’t dilate properly.

'I look back now and think there’s a strong possibility I already had the cancer when I gave birth which terrifies me.

'It took until November for me to realise that it had been over six months and my body still wasn’t back to normal.

'I just kept thinking I was going to get better so delayed going to the doctors.

'On my daughter’s birthday on Boxing Day it’s a tradition for our family to have a dance off on the Wii.

'I’d never had any accidents before so it was a complete shock.

Ms White said she knew something was wrong when she exprienced loss of bladder control, as she had never suffered from it before. She also had symptoms such as irregular periods and back pain. After the cancer diagnosis, she underwent six weeks of radiotherapy and chemotherapy

'We all laughed and I joked that I couldn’t get married wearing a tena lady.'

In hindsight, she says there were other symptoms, too.

‘I was also suffering with lower back ache - which is also a sign of cervical cancer - even before I had Everlyn.'

Despite that, I was up to date with all my smear tests and never dreamt this could happen to me.

'I want to encourage other women to not delay going to the doctors like I did.'

She said: 'I thought doctors would suggest a hysterectomy which I was happy with. I just wanted to live to see my children grow up.

'But they decided the best course of action for me was to undergo six weeks of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Ms White (with partner Gary) said her children were instrumental in keeping her spirits up during treatment. She will find out next month if it has been successful. Her children, clockwise from top left, are: Jake, 14, Trevor, 17, Ella-Rose, 13,Ruby, 8, Everylyn-Ray, 17 months, and Bettsie, 11

About 2,900 cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed each year in the UK.

The symptoms aren't always obvious and may not appear until the disease has reached an advanced stage.

In
 most cases, abnormal bleeding is the first sign. It usually occurs 
after sex although any unusual bleeding should be investigated.

Other symptoms include pain in and around the vagina during sex, an unpleasant smelling discharge and pain when passing urine.

If
 the cancer has spread there may be other symptoms including 
constipation, blood in the urine, loss of bladder control, bone pain and
 swelling in the legs and kidneys.

The NHS offers a free cervical screening test to all women aged 25-64 every three to five years.

It
 is not a test for cervical cancer, but it identifies early 
abnormalities which, if left untreated, could develop into cancer of the
 cervix (neck of the womb).

'My treatment included internal radiotherapy called brachytherapy.

Ms White will find out next month whether the treatment has been successful and if she has the all-clear.

She said: The treatment was really tiring and at times, I felt like giving up.

'But as soon as I got home and saw my children again, I knew I had to fight.

'I really don’t think I could’ve done any of this without them.'

Her children, Trevor, 17, Ella-Rose, 13, Bettsie, 11, Ruby, 8, Everylyn-Ray, 17 months and stepson Jake, 14, were all affected by the devastating news.

Ms White said: 'I want to thank my amazing family, children and friends from the bottom of my heart.

'Even in my darkest moments they all managed to brighten my day.

'One of my friends is taking part in a Shine Walk for cervical cancer in my name soon; I’m so honoured and proud of her.

“I also want to thank the incredible support I received from both the Macmillan nurses and Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust.'

Robert Music, Chief Executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust said: 'Every year 3,000 UK women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 300,000 women will be told they have abnormal cells on the cervix that may require treatment.

'Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust offers information and support to women, their friends and family affected by cervical cancer and abnormalities.

'We urge all women who are eligible for cervical screening to attend when invited. It could, quite simply, save their life.'
