The remains of 55 people have been unearthed from a graveyard at a former reform school with a history of abuse, researchers said today.

University of South Florida researchers began excavating the graveyard at the now-closed Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in September. The dig finished in December.

Official records indicated 31 burials at the Marianna site but researchers had estimated there would be about 50 graves.

Researchers have now found some of the remains of 55 people in a graveyard at the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna, Florida

All the bodies found were interred in 
coffins either made at the school or bought from manufacturers, said 
Erin Kimmerle, a forensic anthropologist leading the university's 
investigation.

Some 
were found under roads or overgrown trees, well away from the white, 
metal crosses marking the 31 officially recorded graves.

Now,
 researchers will try to identify the remains and determine the causes 
of death. The bodies were buried sometime between the late 1920s and 
early 1950s, researchers said.

'We know very little about those who are buried,' Kimmerle said.

They found buttons, a stone marble in a boy's pocket and hardware from coffins. Researchers recovered thousands of nails and a brass plate that read, 'At rest' - likely from a coffin lid.

DNA from the remains will be sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for analysis.

Twelve families have contacted researchers in the hopes of identifying relatives that might have been buried at the school, and officials hope dozens of other families will come forward and provide DNA samples to compare with the remains.

Ovell Krell of Auburndale is one of 
the relatives who already has come forward, hoping to find out what 
happened to her brother.

George Owen Smith was sent to Dozier when he 
was 14 in 1941, and he was found dead a couple of months later.

His 
family never recovered his body, and Krell hopes to claim his remains 
and bury them with their parents at a family plot in central Florida.

'We are hoping for closure,' she said.

Another
 dig is scheduled next month. Nearby residents and former employees and 
inmates at the northwest Florida school are helping investigators 
determine other potential burial sites, Kimmerle said.

Dozier opened in 1900 and closed in 2011 for budgetary reasons.

Some
 former students from the 1950s and 1960s have accused employees and 
guards at the school of physical and sexual abuse, but the Florida 
Department of Law Enforcement concluded after an investigation that that
 it could not substantiate or dispute the claims.

The
 University of South Florida secured a permit to exhume the remains 
after beginning its own research and verifying more deaths and graves 
than documented by law enforcement.

A group of survivors call themselves the 'White House Boys' and five years ago called for an investigation into the graves.

In 2010, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement ended an investigation and said it could not substantiate or refute claims that boys died at the hands of staff.

USF later began its own research and discovered even more graves than the state department had identified. USF has worked for months to secure a permit to exhume the remains, finally receiving permission from Gov. Rick Scott and the state Cabinet after being rejected by Secretary of State Ken Detzner, who reports to Scott.

Robert Straley, a spokesman for the White House Boys, said the school segregated white and black inmates and that the remains are located where black inmates were held. He suspects there is another white cemetery that hasn’t been discovered.

'I think that there are at least 100 more bodies up there,' he said. 'At some point they are going to find more bodies, I’m dead certain of that. There has to be a white graveyard on the white side.'

Among those that have pushed to allow 
USF to conduct the research are Republican Attorney General Pam Bondi 
and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

'My goal all along has been to help bring closure to the families who lost loved ones at Dozier. I feel great relief that the work to identify human remains is now underway,' Bondi said through a spokeswoman.

DNA obtained at the site will be sent to the University of North Texas Center for Human Identification for analysis. If matches are found, remains will be returned to the families.

'They
 want to bury them in family plots and next to the boys’ mothers and 
things like that,' Kimmerle said. 'Anyone whose remains are unidentified
 will be re-interned here at Boot Hill.'

Any
 remains that are re-interned will have a grave marker and their DNA 
will be recorded in case anyone other families seek to identify remains.
