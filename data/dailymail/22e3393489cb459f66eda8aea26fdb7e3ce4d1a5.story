Billionaire Warren Buffett believed the country's richest should be taxed more to help decrease debt

Billionaire Warren Buffett urged U.S. lawmakers to raise taxes on the country's super-rich to help cut the budget deficit, saying such a move will not hurt investments.

The 80-year-old accused Congress of being 'billionaire friendly' and claimed in an opinion article for the New York Times that they spared him and his rich friends when talking about a 'shared sacrifice'.

He said: 'Our leaders have asked for "shared 
sacrifice". But when they did the asking, they spared me.

I checked with
my mega-rich friends to learn what pain they were expecting. They, too,
were left untouched.

'My friends and I have been coddled long enough by a billionaire-friendly Congress.

'It's time for our government to get serious about shared sacrifice.'

Buffett, one of the world's richest men and chairman of conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc, said his federal tax bill last year was $6,938,744.

'That sounds like a lot of money. But what I paid was only 17.4 per cent of my taxable income - and that's actually a lower percentage than was paid by any of the other 20 people in our office.

'Their tax burdens ranged from 33 per cent to 41 per cent and averaged 36 per cent,' he said.

Lawmakers engaged in a partisan battle over spending and taxes for more than three months before agreeing on August 2 to raise the $14.3 trillion U.S. debt ceiling, avoiding a U.S. default.

Mr Buffett said: 'Americans are rapidly losing faith in the ability of Congress to deal with our country's fiscal problems.

'Only action that is immediate, real and very substantial will prevent that doubt from morphing into hopelessness.'

He said higher taxes for the rich will not discourage investment and cited the example of the eighties when rates were much higher.

'Back in the 1980s and 1990s, tax rates for the rich were far higher, and my percentage rate was in the middle of the pack.

'According to a theory I sometimes 
hear, I should have thrown a fit and refused to invest because of the 
elevated tax rates on capital gains and dividends.

'I have worked with investors for 60 years and I have yet to see anyone - not even when capital gains rates were 39.9 per cent in 1976-77 - shy away from a sensible investment because of the tax rate on the potential gain.

'People invest to make money, and potential taxes have never scared them off.'

He also commented that raising taxes would create jobs, contrary to popular belief, saying: 'And to those who argue that higher rates hurt job creation, I would note that a net of nearly 40 million jobs were added between 1980 and 2000. You know what’s happened since then: lower tax rates and far lower job creation'

Speaking on behalf of the country's wealthy, he also said that the rich would not have a problem paying more taxes, if it meant they were helping the country out of a debt hole.

'I know well many of the mega-rich and, by and large, they are very decent people,' he said. 'They love America and appreciate the opportunity this country has given them.

'Many have joined the Giving Pledge, promising to give most of their wealth to philanthropy. Most wouldn’t mind being told to pay more in taxes as well, particularly when so many of their fellow citizens are truly suffering.'

MSNBC's Pat Buchanan challenged Mr Buffett's editorial on 'Morning Joe' telling him to put his money where his mouth is.

He said: 'Why doesn’t he set an example and send a check for $5 billion to the federal government? He’s got about $40 billion.

'You know, you had a plan up there, I talked to Howie Carr at Boston where the super-rich could contribute an extra amount. It was something like one-tenth of one percent did it.

'You get all this noise from these big rich folks. Let them send checks and set an example instead of writing op-eds.'
