A bride-to-be stole more than £500,000 from work to fund a secret online gambling habit - so she could live a lifestyle of luxury with her unwitting fiancé.

Charlotte Darwen, 26, from Leigh, Greater Manchester, appeared to have it all with her two young children, a string of expensive holidays and a forthcoming wedding to her childhood sweetheart at a lavish Tudor country mansion.

The mother-of-two also drove a new car, had put down a deposit on a house and regularly attended star-studded charity balls wearing designer clothes and jewellery.

But unbeknown to her friends, family and 26-year-old fiancé Harrison James, Darwen was propping up her extravagant lifestyle by fleecing her employers - and then secretly gambling the money away on online betting games.

Darwen made more than 350 payments into her personal bank account worth more than £500,000 while working at motor claims firm Action 365 in Stockport, Greater Manchester, a court was told.

At a hearing at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, the court heard how the stolen money was the equivalent to 12 staff wages at the family-run company, where Darwen started working in 2007 as an assistant to the finance director.

The company has since had to lay off several staff and now has almost half the workforce, the court heard.

The mother-of-two made more than 350 illegal payments into her bank account from company funds

Darwen, whose stealing was said to have had a 'devastating effect' on those who trusted her, was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to fraud by abuse of position.

The court heard how Darwen had legitimately won £330,000 from betting sprees and had earned nearly £38,000 from her £15,000-a-year post.

But she had secretly paid £508,120 from company funds into her account since 2011, by creating false invoices and credit notes.

She had also blown nearly £420,000 on gambling sprees alone.

The fraudster had also frittered away chunks of her winnings on luxuries, including a trip to Wembley and sports dinners and concerts where she got herself pictured with cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins and singer Ronan Keating.

She spent £5,000 on cosmetic surgery, £10,000 towards a car and a £48,000 deposit on a house, the court heard.

And the mother-of-two also used the money to go on holiday in Majorca and Florida, posting photos from the lavish holidays on her Facebook page.

The string of false transactions came to light in December 2013 during a company audit.

Prosecutor Kim Irvine said Darwen was asked about the transactions, after it was discovered that 352 payments had been made into her account.

She said: '(Darwen) said she was sorry and explained that she had a gambling habit and tended her resignation.

'She had even made a transfer whilst on maternity leave when she came into the company for a ‘keep in touch day’.'

Facebook photos also show Darwen enjoyed a string of luxury holidays, which were unknowingly paid for by Action 365, the firm in Stockport, Greater Manchester, where she was paid £15,000 per year to work as an assistant

Darwen’s total income from August 2010 to 2013 had been £823,618, the court heard.

Miss Irvine said: 'Money was spent far beyond the defendant’s means.

'There were luxury holidays, £49,000 had been put down as a deposit on a house, £5,000 went on cosmetic surgery.

Darwen was due to marry her childhood sweetheart in a lavish ceremony. The wedding has now been cancelled but the couple are still together, the court was told

'There was an Apple computer, clothing, jewellery, a deposit for a lavish wedding, concerts and sporting events. £10,000 went towards a car.

'She told police she did have a gambling addiction and admitted stealing to support it.'

In a statement Eleanor Lumsden, finance director at the company, said the thefts had left her 'absolutely devastated'.

She said: 'Miss Darwen was someone I trusted and she had abused her position. The total loss of money was a testament to how devious she has been.'

The court heard that the company could not keep staff in work and had to make a large number of redundancies which Mrs Lumsden said 'may not have had to' happen.

She added that the fraud had affected 'a large number of people'. The company, which once employed 300 staff, now only employs 170.

Darwen has since been attending Gamblers Anonymous.

Her wedding to Mr James, whom she has been with since they were 19, has been cancelled but 
the couple are still together.

In mitigation, her counsel Edmund 
Haygarth said: 'This is one of these cases where someone is relieved 
that they were caught and rather regret they hadn’t been caught earlier.

Darwen posted a series of photos on her Facebook profile, showing her lapping up the extravagant lifestyle - while the struggling company from which she stole was forced to lay off staff

'She was trusted by people she regarded as friends and quickly regretted what she did.

The judge told Darwen, who has since been receiving help for her gambling, that her actions had a 'devastating effect' on the people who trusted her

'Her relationship with her long-standing boyfriend had its ups and downs and they were due to be married last month. The wedding was called off but they are now back together.

'Money was spent on luxuries most working people would not be able to afford so easily. She was also taking out payday loans - sometimes when she had a win she frittered the money away.

'This was not just sheer greed - she felt unable to control the urge to gamble. She said she feels worthless, she has let her family and boyfriend down and employers.

'She was friendly with some of the people who suffered because of her actions. She feels she has betrayed the good upbringing she was given.'

Passing sentence Judge Maurice Greene told Darwen: 'You got involved in a spiral of gambling, stealing money then using it and getting into more debt. Both you and this company has suffered as a result.

'What you did has had an almost devastating effect on this company, members of the company, staff - people who trusted you.'

After the case Detective Constable Andy Devonshire from Greater Manchester Police said: 'While many people have been tightening their belts just to make ends meet, Darwen fleeced her company to fund the kind of lifestyle she thought she was entitled to.

'She didn’t put in extra shifts or study for qualifications to pay for it - she just siphoned it off the very people who were paying her wages.

'She managed to buy a new house, enjoy holidays and even paid for cosmetic surgery. She has blamed her amassing of a small fortune on a gambling addiction.

'While it is true she spent a considerable amount on gambling websites, her addiction was by no means restricted to games of chance. She was also clearly addicted to what you might call retail therapy.'

After the court case, neighbours living near to Darwen and her fiancé spoke of their shock.

One elderly neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: 'It is such a shock about Charlotte - I had no idea what she had been doing.

£420,000 on gambling sprees

£5,000 on cosmetic surgery

£10,000 on a new car

£48,000 on a house deposit

Thousands on designer clothes and jewellery

Thousands on a deposit for lavish wedding at Tudor manor house

'I always used to take packages and parcels in for them when they were out. I did it all the time. They had big parcels from Next and Very.

'They always had parcels being dropped off although most of the time they didn't pick them up so I had to remind them.

'Soon I just stopped taking them because there wasn't enough room in my small porch.

'I did notice that her car did change a while back and she got a fancy bronze Nissan.'

The neighbour added: 'She was the most unlikely woman to steal money on this scale. I know her wedding had been called off and that she said she had been staying at her father's.

'She had always been really happy and had lost loads of weight in anticipation for the wedding.

'She was just a happy lady, an unlikely lady to do something like that and Harry was really nice. I just feel terrible for the children.'

Another neighbour said: ''All we saw was a woman wanting to play the perfect middle class wife. She seemed to have it all but it just shows how appearances can fool us all.'
