Classical musician: Katherine Jenkinson (pictured) was told her 11-week-old daughter Olivia was not allowed in London's Oriental Club and was forced to breastfeed her in a parked car outside the premises

A classical musician was banned from taking her newborn baby into a private members club - and had to breastfeed her outside in a car.

Cellist Katherine Jenkinson, 34, is breastfeeding her 11-week-old daughter Olivia Grace.

She had hoped a babysitter could look after the child in her dressing room while she played Haydn’s Piano Trio in G major at the exclusive Oriental Club.

But she was told the baby was not allowed into the central London venue because it would be against a by-law which prohibits anyone under the age of 12 from entering.

Instead, the babysitter had to wait outside the venue with Olivia Grace and Miss Jenkinson had to leave the building during the interval to feed her baby.

The classical cello player breastfed her youngster in a parked car outside the premises, and when she returned to the venue to take to the stage, the babysitter walked around a nearby Marks and Spencer store with Olivia.

Miss Jenkinson told the Daily Telegraph: ‘I’d already arranged a second babysitter to be at home with my four-year-old son as I’m fully aware that it is often inappropriate to take children to such events.

‘Does this really apply to a breastfed 11-week-old babe in arms? I found the way they handled the whole situation very upsetting, insensitive and quite frankly rude.’

Playing in a small ensemble, she has been unable to take maternity leave. Because her daughter is only breastfed, she has to travel with her mother.

Miss Jenkinson said her dressing room was two floors below the bar and dining area where her group - the Aquinas Piano Trio - were performing.

There was no chance of any of the club members - who pay an annual membership fee of up to £1,000 - being disturbed by her baby.

Miss Jenkinson said she had asked a lawyer friend to look into the situation because she was so upset.

She told The Times: ‘I have been advised the club is in the wrong. Even though it is a private members club it is not allowed to do that. It is not about legal action.

‘It is how upset I feel for my baby girl being sent into a freezing winter’s night when there was a perfectly good dressing room where she could have stayed. It would have done no harm to let her in.’

Group violinist Ruth Rogers talked to the club management ‘for hours’ on the morning of the concert in an effort to resolve the issue.

The exclusive club was founded nearly 200 years ago by returning officers and officials from India and the East.

The first members had to have a connection to that quarter of the globe and it was frequented by distinguished dignitaries, returning servicemen and civil servants, those who had ridden elephants and dined with Indian princes.

The by-laws banning children from the venue are the club's own regulations, which could be a breach of the law.

The  Equality Act 2010 made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport, unless it was deemed unsafe or there was a good reason why the premises was single-sex.

Last night no-one at the club was available for comment.

‘Victorian’ policy: The incident comes after mother-of-three Lou Burns (pictured), 35, was recently asked to cover herself with a large napkin *(right) as she breastfed her baby at the five-star Claridge’s hotel in Mayfair

Controversy: Claridge's said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but asks that women are 'discreet towards guests'

The incident last week comes after mother Lou Burns, 35, was recently asked to cover herself as she breastfed her baby in Claridge’s hotel. 

The mother of three  was left humiliated after staff at the five-star Mayfair hotel gave her a giant napkin to cover up as she fed her 12-week-old daughter Isadora during afternoon tea.

Mrs Burns, who is married to comedy actor Nick Burns, was reportedly told by staff to use the napkin to avoid 'causing offence', but said she was left humiliated and burst into tears afterwards.

At the time, she said: ‘I was really shocked as I had never experienced this before. Through my tears I tried to explain that I was really quite cross.' 

She criticised the hotel’s ‘Victorian’ policy and the incident led to a mass breastfeeding protest outside the five-star Mayfair hotel. 

The demonstration, organised by Free to Feed - which campaigns for the 'normalising' of public breastfeeding - saw dozens of mothers brave freezing conditions to sit outside the hotel's grand front doors and feed their infants. 

Claridge's has said it 'embraces' breastfeeding, but requests that women are 'discreet towards other guests'. 

Many travelled from as far away as Staffordshire for the protest, which came after UKIP leader Nigel Farage waded into the debate, by suggesting mothers of newborn babies should avoid being 'openly ostentatious' when breastfeeding and think about sitting in a corner when doing so.

He insisted it was 'not too difficult' to feed a child in a way that was 'not openly ostentatious', and even defended the Mayfair hotel, saying that each establishment should be able to impose their own rules about when and where breastfeeding should be done.

The UKIP leader also suggested that many people feel 'very, very embarrassed' when they see a child being breastfed.

His comments sparked fury, with many Twitter users suggesting that Mr Farage himself should 'hide in the corner' over his 'outrageous' stance.

Mumsnet chief executive Justine Roberts also added that it was 'bemusing' for anyone to think of breastfeeding as 'ostentatious'.

But as the backlash over his comments grew, the outspoken MP attempted to play down the controversy by insisting he did not 'personally endorse' women perhaps sitting in a corner.

However, in a statement released through Twitter to clarify his position, Mr Farage still maintained it was up to each establishment to decide on their own rules. 

The latest controversy comes at a time when more women are being encouraged to breastfeed, with a new study suggesting that continuing to do so until babies are 18 months old could save the NHS £40million.

The government argues that breastfeeding has 'huge health benefits for mother and baby', particularly vulnerable babies in neonatal and special care baby units.

A report by a team of researchers led by Brunel University has suggested that the NHS could save millions by enoucraging women to breastfeed for longer, reducing common childhood illnesses and also cutting the risk of women developing breast cancer over their lifetime, which is said to be linked to low rates of breastfeeding.

However, on its website, the NHS says: 'You shouldn't ever be made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. 

'In fact, the Equality Act 2010 has made it illegal for anyone to ask a breastfeeding woman to leave a public place such as a cafe, shop or public transport.' 

MailOnline has contacted the Oriental Club for comment.

According to the Equality Act of 2010, it is discriminatory to treat a woman unfavourably because she is breastfeeding.

However, in September a breastfeeding mother claimed that she was ordered to cover up with a dirty dishcloth while joining friends for a breakfast.

Olivia Pozniak, a single 25-year-old, was feeding her 11-week-old son Louie at the Furze Wren pub owned by J D Wetherspoon in Bexleyheath, Kent, when she was told to cover up.

Meanwhile, in August Natasha Barnett, 29, from Newport Pagnell, Buckinghamshire, was told by a lifeguard at Middleton Pool that she could not breastfeed her five-month-old daughter Olive because it was 'classed as eating and drinking'.

In June, a mother was asked to sit in a corner by a waitress while breastfeeding her son - to keep her away from schoolchildren eating in the same restaurant.

Carrie Davies, 27, was left feeling 'embarrassed and ashamed' after staff at Global Buffet in Cardiff suggested she move while feeding her four-month-old son Trystan.

Ms Davies, who was lunching with a friend, was offered a spot by the restaurant's toilets, which bosses at the restaurant say was more 'convenient' for her in light of a large school party who had started eating there.

It comes after around 70 women descended on Sports Direct in Nottingham city centre in April to show support for 25-year-old Wioletta Komar, who claimed she was kicked out of the premises earlier this year for breastfeeding her three-month-old son.

She claims a member of staff suddenly marched over and told her that breastfeeding mothers were not welcome because of 'company policy'.

The sales assistant then told her that the store had no facilities for her and suggested she should go to McDonald's which had a baby and mother room.
