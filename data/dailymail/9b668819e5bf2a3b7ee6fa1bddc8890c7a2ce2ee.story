A father-of-12 has been branded 
‘Britain’s most badly-behaved dad’ after he was arrested on suspicion of
assault - just 20 minutes before he was due to appear in court over an 
Asbo.

Stuart Murgatroyd was led away in 
handcuffs from Burnley Magistrates Court before he had a chance to 
challenge the order laid against him.

The 41-year-old had become the fifth 
member of his clan to get an anti social behaviour order after 
terrorising neighbours in two council boroughs.

However when he went to the court to 
‘vehemently deny’ any wrongdoing he was arrested after allegedly having a
bust-up with the mother of his children before the case had even begun.

Police were called to the court, in 
Burnley, Lancashire, after 40-year old Dawn Hughes - the mother of Murgatroyd's 12 children and one other from a previous relationship
- was left in tears.

The case was later adjourned after prosecution lawyers informed JPs unemployed Murgatroyd was in police cells.

Lancashire Police confirmed 
Murgatroyd had been held on suspicion of common assault. His Asbo 
hearing will now be held on October 16.

Murgatroyd has a criminal record for robbing elderly people and once had to be sprayed with CS gas by police in a row over his son’s football.

Despite only being 13 years old, 
Murgatroyd’s twin boys - Reece and Dillon - already have two-year Asbos 
ordering them not to cause ‘harassment, alarm or distress’.

The pair are now banned from 
‘maliciously throwing’ things at people, vehicles or buildings and from 
swearing or using offensive hand gestures.

Council officials had earlier kicked 
the family out of one of their previous homes, in Padiham after 125 
complaints from neighbours who had endured three years of loud parties, 
fighting and drunken behaviour.

Murgatroyd has been claiming sickness benefit for depression since he was 17.

'Bust-up': Murgatroyd with his long-term partner Dawn Hughes, shortly before the Asbo court hearing

In April 1999 he was jailed for two-and-a-half years for mugging three pensioners and stealing a handbag from a woman of 78 in a cemetery.

In August 2004 he suffered head injuries when he was attacked by a neighbour armed with a 2ft-long machete amid claims a text message had been sent threatening to firebomb the home of the attacker’s mother.

Then in 2007 Murgatroyd sparked a police siege after a row over a neighbour confiscating his children’s football. He was said to have lost his temper and hurled cutlery and a vacuum cleaner towards officers before being overpowered with CS gas.

Murgatroyd had previously been issued
with an Asbo but after it expired last November the couple and eight of
their children moved into a £150-a-week rented three-bed terrace house 
in Nelson hoping to make a ‘fresh start’.

However, he was given an interim Asbo
and warned he must not be in possession of any open container of 
alcohol or be drunk in a public place with the Burnley Borough and 
Pendle Council areas.

Speaking about the Asbo, Inspector 
Andy Cartwright, of Pendle Police, said: ‘This action has been taken as a
result of repeated complaints from members of the public.

‘Asbos are designed to put 
restrictions on a person so that they can assess the way they behave and
hopefully make a few changes for the better.

‘We are not Britain's worst family. . . We’re the victims'

Dawn Hughes, Stuart Murgatroyd's partner

‘We hope these orders will provide a 
more long term solution by putting certain boundaries in place whilst 
agencies continue to support them in the family home.’

In an interview before the court 
appearance Murgatroyd and Hughes claimed police and council officials 
should do more to help them.

Hughes said: ‘I think we are being 
targeted by the police and everybody is just lying about everything. 
They are dredging up past history.

‘It is only the twins who have got Asbos anyway and they now want Stuart to have one to set an example to the kids.

‘The boys had been throwing stones but they’re identical so how do they know which one it was. They were just being lads.

'They were hanging around with older 
boys at the time and there was a big group of them. There was about 20 
of them so who knows who was doing what. It’s just typical boyish 
behaviour.

‘We did have the police coming to the house four times a day and they haven’t been once seen we’ve been here.

‘Moving here was meant to be a clean break, a fresh start for us and the kids and someone has just nipped that in the bud.

‘We are not Britain’s worst family, far from it - this house is immaculate. We’re the victims.’

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
