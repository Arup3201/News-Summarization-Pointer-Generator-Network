At least one in six flowering plants is blooming, with hundreds more in flower than is normal for the time of year.

A stunning 368 species of wild plants are in flower when botanical books suggest there should be only 20-30.

Daisy and dandelion were the most commonly recorded wild flowers by amateur plant hunters around the country.

More exotic species include heliotrope, gorse – found in all areas – and sea campion located on the coast of Anglesey.

Early spring flowering plants include Hazel, Lesser Celandine and Primrose. The findings come from the New Year Plant Hunt run by the Botanical Society of Britain & Ireland.

Plant lovers spent up to three hours between 1st and 4th January hunting for wild plants in flower. 

They compiled 143 lists, of which half contained 20 or more plants in flower.

A total of 2,908 records of plants in flower from across Britain and Ireland were submitted, including 368 different species.

The most commonly recorded plants were Daisy and Dandelion, each of which was recorded in 115 lists – three-quarters of the total.

Only 12 species were recorded in more than half of the lists, and most were only rarely found in flower.

Some 160 species were only recorded in flower once, and 60 were only recorded twice.

Dr Tim Rich, Plant Hunt co-founder, said ‘368 species in flower is an unprecedented 15 per cent of the flowering plants in Britain and Ireland: the books suggest there should only be 20-30 species in flower.

‘As expected, the mild south and west of Britain had the highest numbers of species still in flower, but we also had lists of over 50 species from the east and north of England, and an amazing 39 flowering in Edinburgh.

‘We thought that the snow and hard frosts before Christmas would have finished most flowering in the north but it seems not to be the case.

‘In terms of absolute numbers, Cardiff won with 71 species in flower and Cornwall came second with 70 species in flower’.

Co-ordinator Ryan Clark, said ‘It was astonishing to see so many records flooding in, from Guernsey to the Moray Firth and Norfolk to Donegal.

‘As in previous years, it was clear that urban areas tended to have more species in flower than rural areas. 

'This is to be expected: there are more sheltered corners and disturbed ground with wild flowers with a short life cycle and high seed production and plants spreading out from gardens.

‘Around one third of the plants in flower proved to be species not native to Britain and Ireland, which may have escaped from gardens or cultivation. 

'Plants from warmer climates may be continuing to flower in the mild autumn weather before winter frosts knock them back.’

Dr Rich says there is no suggestion of an early Spring.

‘Only five per cent of the species recorded were spring-flowering native specialists, such as Dog’s Mercury, and half of the records of spring flowering plants were from just three species: Hazel, Lesser Celandine and Primrose’ he added.

Dr Sarah Whild, who co-founded the Plant Hunt in 2012, said the total number of species recorded this year was much higher than 222 spotted in 2014, mainly due to an increase in botanists involved.

‘I’m delighted to see the Plant Hunt blossoming and even inspiring other countries to follow suit, with The Netherlands launching their own Plant Hunt this year’ she added.  

But the blooming numbers don't suggest an early spring. Only five per cent of the species recorded were spring-flowering native specialists
