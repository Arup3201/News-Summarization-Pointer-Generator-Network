It looks like a glittering golden palace fit for a Russian tsar, and its appearance on the Moscow property market is perhaps a sign of the crisis facing the super-rich amid the rouble's collapse.

With nine sumptuous bedrooms, Baroque-style living areas and two swimming pools - as well as being decorated with gold throughout - this home looks almost too lavish for royalty.

Chandeliers hang from the ceilings and every room is fitted with exclusive custom-made ornate furniture, with the mansion sitting amid towering pine trees in its own 97 acres.

Fit for an oligarch: This sumptuous palace is for sale in Moscow's most elite suburb - and is only the third most expensive on the market

Luxury: The £70million estate has 97 acres of pine forest and custom-made furniture, with copious amounts of decorative gold throughout

Excess: The luxury of the mansion, including its snooker room, is a testament to the eye-watering wealth of some in post-Soviet Russia

But all this luxury comes at a price, with only billionaire oligarchs - many of whom have suffered mega losses due to the rouble fall - likely to be able to afford the hefty $109 million (£70 million) price tag.

Located in Russia's 'Beverly Hills', it is described by estate agents as being 'in the style of the country estates of the European aristocracy'.

The identity of the seller is not disclosed. 

In its sales material Sotheby's International Realty states: 'The interiors are reminiscent of Baroque palaces.

'The rooms have a lot of gold, natural stone and precious wood. In some rooms the floors are made of natural marble and the billiard room and library are solid oak and mahogany.'

The 'golden palace' is located in the prestigious Rublyovka suburb in Moscow, where A-listers reside and property prices are some of the highest in the world.

Snug: One of the house's nine bedrooms is themed entirely in red, black and gold, even down to the colours of the wooden floor

Luxury: The walk-in shower, set on a central marble plinth, is big enough for an oligarch and a few mistresses for good measure

Tub: Even the bathrooms do not escape the marble, chandeliers and gold. The collapse of the rouble raises doubts over the home's future

Panelling: The study has hints of James Bond. The suburb of Rublyovka, where the mansion is, became a Beverly Hills in the 1990s

Entertaining: Should you buy the palace, there is ample enough room to invite round all your oligarch friends for caviar and fizz

The three-storey main residence, which has similarities to a modern French chateau, has 2,300 square metres of living space. 

Inside, the bedrooms are particularly notable, with each one dripping in gold and decorated in a different style. Some feature four-poster beds, while others boast expensive works of art on the walls, but all resemble presidential suites in luxury hotels.

One of the main living areas contains a grand piano, while the spa and massage zone has hints of Arabia about its decor. Swimmers taking advantage of the larger indoor swimming pool will notice the Sistine Chapel-esque painting on the ceiling.

The mansion comes completely fully-furnished, with some of the pieces made by European cabinet makers.

Rublyovka, in pleasant woodland on one side of the Moscow River, became a Russian equivalent of Beverly Hills in the 1990s following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

The western suburb quickly became home to billionaire oligarchs, showbusiness stars, government officials and industry tycoons.

Arabesque: There are hints of the exotic in the house's swimming pool and spa rooms, with patterned tiles and teapots

Entertaining: In the dining room, it's difficult to check one's reflection in the mirror on the left without an expensive vase getting in the way

Reception room: With thick padded walls, the space where guests are invited for an introductory drink has the air of a Swiss bank vault

Welcome: The entrance hall boasts one of the house's most opulent chandeliers, dangling over a central table and viewing gallery

As well as expensive properties, the area also boasts exclusive boutique shops and sports clubs frequented by the rich and famous.

As an indication of the exclusivity of the neighbourhood, the golden palace is not even the most expensive on the market, with others commanding higher prices.

Ilya Menzhutov, director of the elite real estate company Metrium Grupp, said: 'It is by far not the most expensive house in Rublyovka.

'As of today, there is at least two houses that outrun the mansion in price. One of them is $130million (£85million) and the other is $150 million (£98million).

'Moreover, the most expensive estate is not in the famous Rublyovka but off the Skolkovskoye highway, where the buyer will have to pay $200 million (£130million).'

The house is not even the most expensive one for sale in the elite neighbourhood - others are priced at £85million and £98million

Golden: The rise of the super-rich in Russia was at its peak in the 1990s as former nationalised industries were sold to private investors

Music: One of the rooms has a grand piano with wooden inlays, in case the creative urge decides to hit the home's wealthy owner

Some of the bedrooms boast expensive works of art on the walls, and all resemble presidential suites in luxury hotels in the west

Estate agents in Moscow are divided on how well such homes will sell at the moment, particularly amid the rouble crisis and Russia's slide towards recession.

In its November review on the premium market, before the latest slump, IntermarkSavills suggested that the fall of the currency was becoming critically important. 

After its collapse, the official rate is around 60 roubles to the dollar. Many estate agents are now advertising their prices in dollars - or setting a fixed rate of 37 to 45 roubles to the dollar, said Nina Reznichenko, the head of suburban real estate department at IntermarkSavills.

'Clients have also reacted to such dramatic changes almost immediately: negotiations are getting longer, and the majority of purchases are made in below $2million segment.'.

Tweed estate agents say the buyers of the most expensive properties have been put off by the currency problems.

Just a few miles away in Moscow's supermarkets, the nation's economic woes take a very different form - with shelves stripped bare thanks to economic sanctions.

Russia has banned cheese imports from nations which are imposing sanctions - including Germany, the Netherlands, France, Poland and Lithuania - and chicken imports from the U.S. amid growing international tension over its involvement in Ukraine.
