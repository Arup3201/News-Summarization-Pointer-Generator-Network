Fabrice Muamba says he feared the worst when he heard that Bafetimbi Gomis had collapsed at White Hart Lane.

It is three years since Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest while playing for Bolton in an FA Cup quarter final against Tottenham.

Muamba, 26, fell to the ground while no one was standing near him and his heart stopped for 78 minutes.

And when Muamba saw Gomis collapse on the same pitch, he said: ‘Not that place again.’

Gomis tweeted after the game that he was fine and had collapsed due to the stress of his father’s illness. But this is the third time it has happened to the French striker and Muamba does not expect him to play again without being cleared by a number of medical experts.

Speaking to the Daily Express, Muamba said: ‘I am sure he will not be allowed to play for a couple of weeks or even a couple of months.

‘I am 100 per cent sure he’ll see a specialist. He will probably see three specialists and two of them need to give him the all-clear before he can play again.

‘It’s very different to what happened to me. Bafetimbi Gomis has a history of medical issues. I did not have a history, so it was a real surprise when it happened to me.’

It is three years since Muamba suffered a cardiac arrest while playing for Bolton against Spurs

On 17 March 2012, Fabrice Muamba collapsed on the pitch at White Hart Lane during an FA Cup quarter-final match between Bolton and Tottenham.

The former Trotters midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest and received life-saving medical treatment from Spurs staff and consultant cardiologist Dr Andrew Deaner, who was at the game as a fan, from the pitch.

Muamba was rushed to the nearby London Chest Hospital, accompanied by then manager Owen Coyle and striker Kevin Phillips, for emergency treatment while the game was abandoned.

Muamba's heart was reported to have stopped for 78minutes while the former Birmingham player received numerous defibrillator shocks on the pitch and in the ambulance.

Despite fears that he would not survive, the 26-year-old made a miraculous recovery before being discharged from hospital on April 16 - although he was forced to retire from professional football.
