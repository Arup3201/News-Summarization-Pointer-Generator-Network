The men's final of the Australian Open between Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic was disrupted by a group of protesters against the Manus Island immigration detention facility on Sunday. 

Wearing t-shirts with slogans such as 'Shut down Manus' and 'Australia open for refugees', the political activists made their presence known during the second set and descended on to the Rod Laver Arena's centre court.  

The Manus Island immigration detention facility, also known as the Manus Island Regional processing centre is an offshore asylum processing institution located on Manus Island, Papa New Guinea, which operates on behalf of the Australian Government.

Recently, the centre has been the subject of a number of protests on account of its perceived harsh treatment of detainees, who have been denied basic amenities as they bid for asylum. 

The policy of detaining asylum seekers offshore - intended as an immigration deterrent - has been criticised by several human rights groups. 

Following the court invasion, Australian Open officials released a statement on Twitter, confirming the arrests of two protesters.  

'Two people have been arrested after a court invasion during the second set of the men's final,' they wrote.

'Security responded immediately. Both were quickly removed with minimal disruption to play.'

Apparently unperturbed by the incident, Djokovic went on to beat Murray to claim his fifth Australian Open title.
