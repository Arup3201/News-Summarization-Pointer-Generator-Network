With its swathes of waving blue flowers, delicious scent and squadrons of butterflies and bees, I am standing in a field that could be in Provence in the South of France.

A great plantation of lavender, rows and rows of it, stretches away from me, snaking across the hillside. Close your eyes and you could be on the slopes of Mont Ventoux, where lavender is as important a crop as wheat or grapes.

Amazingly, however, I am on a very special 50-acre farm in North Yorkshire — a county where conservative farmers rarely venture away from traditional livestock and grain growing.

Emma Goodwill tends to the lavender on the farmland bought by her father, Nigel. He acquired it as an investment following the death of his wife, Lynne, from breast cancer in 1993

This lavender farm belongs to the Goodwill family, and for all the beauty it brings to the landscape, the story of how this field of soft blue came to grow there is a deeply poignant one.

In 1993, Nigel Goodwill’s wife Lynne died of breast cancer. Their son, Sam, was just five years old and their daughter, Emma Jane, had turned three only a few days before.

Their devastated dad, a Yorkshire-born property businessman, decided to leave work and raise the two children himself. He was devoted to his new role. The children went to the school near their village of Terrington, which is not far from Castle Howard.

A year after Lynne’s death, Nigel heard about some land just outside the village which was coming up for sale.

It may look like a scene from Provence - but this is in fact the Goodwill family's 50-acre farm in North Yorkshire

‘I wanted to buy something for the children as an investment, so I put in a bid,’ he says. But he said nothing to the children, not wishing to disappoint them if he failed to get it.

‘On the day the deal was to be done, I asked my solicitor to call me at home and, if I had been successful, use code if one of the children answered the phone. The solicitor called later, and said cryptically to Sam: “Tell your father to take a bath.”’

Hearing the message, Nigel realised he’d got the farm and jumped in the car with Sam and Emma.

‘When we got there, I said to them: “This is your farm now.” And when I saw them running across the field towards the woodland, I knew I’d done the right thing.’

Nigel, who insists he is neither a gardener nor farmer, wanted to do something different with the land.

‘I wondered what to grow, and had decided it should be garlic, but then one day, in a waiting room, I picked up a magazine and began reading an article about lavender.’

Inspired, he did some research into the soil and hill position of the farm — then planted ten types of lavender in the field.

It became a project for him and the children. They’d regularly go there after school to work on the fledgling farm.

Emma, who’s now 22, remembers it well. ‘It never seemed odd to us,’ she says. ‘Dad and Sam did most of the work, while I watched.’

It takes four years for a lavender plant to reach full size. The largest of the species, Lavendin Grosso — the type favoured in Provence for making lavender oil, toiletries and soap — grows to 3ft. 

There are a number of traditional, English-bred varieties, including my personal favourite, Hidcote, which has the deepest blue flowers yet grows to just 18 in high.

At first it seems extraordinary that lavender, a plant associated with sunshine and blue skies, should do so well in the Yorkshire hills, which are often snow-covered in winter and where winds can blow at up to 100 miles an hour.

But Nigel, who has never been to Provence, had realised at the outset that lavender could survive on his children’s farm. ‘Lavender is very hardy and can take frosts of up to minus 20,’ he says.

In fact, the Yorkshire climate mirrors that of the South of France, where winters are also harsh.

The lavender on the farm begins life as a cutting, propagated in a tunnel. Once these cuttings have formed a small but sturdy bush, they can be planted outside.

Head gardener Julia Snowball says: ‘All they need is plenty of good drainage, so a hilly position is perfect, and poor soil is fine.’

She plants a variety of lavenders, not just for the pretty patchwork created by the various purples, blue, pinks and white, but so they can pick it from May until September.

‘Folgate is the first to flower, then Hidcote — and we are still picking flowers in November from the Vera lavender,’ says Julia.

Once the flowering is over, the lavender is pruned down to the hard wood, which helps ensure abundant flowering the following year and keeps the plants tidy.

Today, there is a shop and tea room selling food and products made with their own lavender.

I have to admit being sceptical about the use of lavender in food. I remember, years ago, ordering a lavender pannacotta in a café: it tasted like body lotion.

‘Ah, that is because chefs have to know which lavender to use,’ says Nigel. 

‘There are two main groups: Lavendin, which is used for soaps and perfume, and Augustifolia, which is best for cooking because it has less oil. If a chef gets the wrong type, then food can taste awful.’ 

Recipes for their own lavender biscuits, jams, ice cream and scones have been perfected over the years. Sam now runs Lavender World, the farm’s online shop, while Emma, who has just graduated from university, is currently working at the farm.

Nigel often refers to them collectively as ‘the boss’. ‘It’s their farm,’ he says. ‘They make all the decisions — and I work for them.’

I taste an ‘EJ’ sundae, named after Emma, from a tall glass packed with a sinful combination of lavender ice cream, honeycomb crisp, crushed berries and whipped cream. Rich and fragrant, the slight, heady hint of mint from the lavender is subtle and surprising.

The freshly baked scones, dotted with flowers and served with a dollop of clotted cream and a berry and lavender jam, are a revelation.

Outside, visitors begin to arrive. The farm has become a popular stop for tourists. Some just marvel at the oddity of it — a purple patch on a landscape of wheat fields and green pasture; some come to buy lavender and other plants for their own gardens and window boxes.

At the heart of a lavender field is a memorial to Lynne: four pyramids each built to the height of father, mother, son and daughter at the time of her death. The pyramid representing the three-year-old Emma is particularly moving.

‘Breast cancer is a terrible disease,’ says Nigel. “My mother died of it, as well as my wife. It is awful ...” He trails off, looking away.

His family’s unusual farm has achieved extraordinary success, but none of it was planned. It grew from a small idea to bring some happiness back to three people, and became a lot more besides.

‘We never expected it to be like this,’ says Emma, frantically serving a queue of customers buying lavender plants. ‘I think Mum would be laughing with us from heaven.’
