Mike Brown is set to return for England against Scotland on Saturday after taking a full part in training for the first time since suffering concussion against Italy three weeks ago.

England’s first-choice full back was knocked unconscious in the early stages of his side’s 47-17 victory over the Azzurri and missed last Sunday’s 19-9 loss by Ireland in Dublin, where Saracens’ Alex Goode stood in.

Brown suffered a setback in his recovery last week when he experienced headache-like symptoms after beginning return-to-play protocols.

But he has since completed the six-day programme and participated in controlled contact training against Hartpury College at England’s Surrey base on Friday. ‘Mike took a full part in training and will be available for selection,’ an England spokesman confirmed.

Brown's return for his 36th cap would provide a significant boost for Stuart Lancaster, whose team were out-thought and outmuscled against Joe Schmidt’s championship favourites last week.

Lancaster will also be able to call on Northampton lock Courtney Lawes after he completed his second game for Saints following the ankle surgery which saw him miss England’s opening three Six Nations fixtures.

Lawes looks certain to win his 37th cap at Twickenham on Saturday, meaning George Kruis or Dave Attwood will drop to the bench, leaving Nick Easter’s position under threat.

Alex Goode in line to replace Luther Burrell if his calf problem persists

Brad Barritt starts in the centre for Saracens when they take on Wasps at the Ricoh Arena on Sunday, where Goode starts at fly-half, and he could make his first start of the championship if Luther Burrell’s calf problem persists.

The Northampton centre has started the first three games of England’s campaign at No 12 alongside Jonathan Joseph but suffered the leg injury in Dublin and has been severely restricted in training. Billy Twelvetrees played 80 minutes for Gloucester in their Aviva Premiership draw with Northampton but he has endured an up-and-down season and struggled badly off the bench against Ireland, leaving the ever-reliable Barritt in line for a place among the replacements at least.

Northampton flanker Tom Wood could also return to the international fold after proving his fitness from the ankle injury he sustained in January, although James Haskell is likely to be retained at blindside, putting Tom Croft’s place on the bench in danger.

Out-of-favour scrum-half Danny Care scored a try for Harlequins as they beat London Irish yesterday but is not expected to return as Richard Wigglesworth and Ben Youngs fill the No 9 slots, while Danny Cipriani will have to settle for a place on the bench again after being one of only two unused replacements in Dublin.

Loosehead prop Alex Corbisero played 60 minutes for Saints yesterday but Joe Marler and Mako Vunipola are favourites to retain their places when Lancaster names his team to face the winless Scots on Wednesday. England’s players will reconvene at Pennyhill Park before recommencing training on Tuesday.
