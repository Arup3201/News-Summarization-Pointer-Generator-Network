When young soldier Pan Zhishan was torn apart from his new wife amid the chaos of war 70 years ago, he never gave up hope that he would see her again.

He married Zhang Suiyu while preparing to take on the invading Japanese forces in south-eastern China's Fujian province.

The pair were forced apart when the conflict ended and Pan was ordered back to his parents' home in another province, where they had arranged an approved marriage for him.

But Pan, now 90, and Zhang were never able to forget each other - and now seven decades later they have been reunited after an astonishing internet tracking triumph by local netizens.

'What took you so long?' asked Zhang, now 88, when the pair finally met up in Fujian province on China's Valentine's Day at the weekend.

'I know. I am so late,' said Pan as the pair embraced.

Pan added: 'We both came from traditional families and we knew it was forbidden to marry without their permission - but we both expected to be dead at any moment so we snatched what joy we could from life.'

After their separation 70 years ago, Pan did his best to forget his first love.

'I fought with my father, but it was no good.

'I tried to leave that old life behind, but what I didn't know then was that Zhang was pregnant when I left and that we had had a son,' said Pan, who had three children with his second wife.

'I got on with my new life, but I never forgot my first love.

'Some years after I'd left she'd sent me a picture of herself and of our son. I was shocked and always kept the pictures with me wherever I went.'

By 2003, the urge to rediscover his first family was too much and Pan disappeared from his family to track down Zhang.

'Her village was gone and all the people in it had left years ago. It was one frustrating dead end after another and I thought I'd left it too late,' he said.

But last weekend the pair were finally reunited, along with their grandson, after an internet campaign by local media.

'I can't believe we're together again,' said Pan.

'I now have everything I ever wanted from life. The last wish in my life has been met.'
