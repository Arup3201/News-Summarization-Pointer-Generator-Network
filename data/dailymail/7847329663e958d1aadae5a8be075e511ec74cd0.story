A diplomatic protection officer is facing jail after abandoning his post at the Israeli embassy in London to meet his lover.

Ricci Giff, 38, left his patrol on three occasions to see Melissa Ramsden, a PR manager for the Israeli tourist board who later committed suicide.

Giff twice met with Miss Ramsden, 37, at her home in Queen's Park, West London, and once at a hotel in North London.

Guilty: Ricci Giff (left) admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office at Southwark Crown Court. Melissa Ramsden (right), 37, PR manager for Israel's tourism office in London, committed suicide in December 2011

The officer, from Sandy, Bedfordshire, admitted three counts of misconduct in a public office at Southwark Crown Court.

He admitted that he 'willfully misconducted himself, namely by leaving the area of his patrol' between October 27 and December 3 2011.

Giff was originally charged with 
surrendering both a police issue firearm and CS spray while he was supposed to be working for the
diplomatic protection group at the embassy.

The original summons stated that Giff 
'absented himself from protective duties' outside the Israeli Embassy in Kensington, West London.

It is not known who he gave the weapon to or why during the alleged incident and the charge was later amended in court to remove reference to the embassy.

Adjourning sentence until later this month, Judge Anthony Leonard QC said: 'I will allow a short adjournment so that the probation service can prepare a report.

'You should understand that that is not an indication that a sentencing judge would not think it is appropriate to send you straight inside but it allows a judge to have that possible alternative to consider.'

An inquest into Miss Ramsden's death said that she was found slumped by the side of her bed by a friend who came to feed her cat on December 22 in 2011.

Lover: Giff met Melissa Ramsden, a PR manager for the Israeli tourist board who later committed suicide, on three occasions while on duty

Miss Ramsden had suffered with anxiety and had previously dealt with addictions to alcohol, cannabis and crack cocaine.

She had also previously suffered from Bulimia and had been diagnosed with a mild personality disorder.

Westminster Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox recorded a verdict of suicide after hearing how she left a note on the sofa at her flat in which she said: 'I don't have the energy to carry on.

It read: 'I have run out of any energy. My life seems to just exist from one mess to the next.

'Thank you to everyone who has tried to make my life better. To all those at work who bullied me, I hope those people get what they deserve through Karma.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
