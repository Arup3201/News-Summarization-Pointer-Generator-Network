Smartphones enable us to be constantly connected.

And now a new survey reveals that people are taking their tech addiction to the bathroom with them.

It found that a third of Britons admit to answering work calls while on the toilet, with almost 80 per cent admitting they are ‘toilet tweeters’.

Revolting: A new study has revealed that a third of Britons admit to answering work calls while on the toilet (illustrated), with almost 80 per cent say they are ‘toilet tweeters’

The study of more than 2,000 Britons, found more than half of people surf the net, respond to emails and interact on social media while sitting on the toilet.

Interestingly, it shows that despite admitting to using technology in the bathroom ourselves we have double standards when it comes to others.

While 70 per cent of people say the thought of someone calling them on the toilet is disgusting, almost 40 per cent have done just that by phoning a colleague, according to the survey, which was commissioned by bathstore.com.

It appears that women are more likely to pick up the phone to talk in the bathroom than men, with 15 per cent of females saying that they have spoken to a friend, compared to just six per cent of males.

Multitasking: The study also revealed that some people use their time in the bathroom to sort out their finances using online banking - 30 per cent- or watch a TV programme - 15 per cent - while going about their business

A survey released in July showed that half of us play mobile games while sitting on the toilet.

Men are most likely to play while going to the toilet at 50 per cent, compared to around a third of women, according to Mind Candy.

Almost 60 per cent of people admited to pushing buttons as opposed to counting sheep.

The survey revealed that women find it hardest to switch off at bed time, with over two thirds gaming before lights out, compared to 52 per cent of men.

On average, people who play gaming apps on their smartphone wile away nearly 45 minutes a day.

The study also revealed that some industrious people use their time in the bathroom to sort out their finances using online banking - 30 per cent - or watch a TV programme - 15 per cent - while going about their business.

‘The bathroom isn't the place to hold a conversation and people should especially not be tempted to pick up the phone when they're at home,’ said William Hanson, bathstore's etiquette expert

‘If you're mid-way through a conversation with a colleague at work, put the conversation on pause until you've finished your business.’

A recent study found that half of people play mobile games such as Candy Crush, while going to the toilet.

According to the survey, by London-based gaming group Mind Candy, men have the worst habits, with more than half confessing a quick, secret gaming fix while in the bathroom.

A previous survey has found that 58 per cent of people admit to pushing buttons as opposed to counting sheep before bed. Women find it hardest to switch off at bed time, with over two thirds gaming before lights out, compared to 52 per cent of men
