One lucky lottery winner won enough money to buy several homes but has been able to stay in his taxpayer-funded council house

When most people hit the jackpot, they tend to splash their cash on frivolous shopping, plush sports cars and luxury homes.

But one lucky lottery winner - who had the money to buy several pads wherever he so desired - is still living in a council house in Stroud.

This means that despite his mega-win, his lifestyle is still being partly footed by the taxpayer.

And he is entitled to stay in his local authority property, paying subsidised rent and no mortgage, as a lifetime tenant.

The man in Gloucestershire - who has not been named - is said to have won a 'significant' sum but council rules prevent him being forced to move out
of social housing and buy his own place.

The news comes at a time where there are more than 3,200 people who cannot afford their own homes on the council house waiting list in the Stroud area.

Stroud District council tenant Margaret Marshall said she thought it was vastly unfair and that the lottery winner should move on.

'If I won then I'd go, because other people need homes,' said Mrs Marshall, who has lived at her address in Nailsworth for over 30 years.

'Otherwise, I might buy it, then they could build another with the money,' she said.

The revelation of the winner's decision to stay in their home came at Stroud District Council's housing advisory panel.

'We had someone who won on the lottery a large, significant sum,' the council's housing advice manager Sue Leighton-Boyce told the meeting.

'They are still our tenant although they clearly had enough money to go out and buy several homes.'

Councillors were discussing a review of their council homes allocation policy after a Government consultation suggested ending lifetime tenancies.

A further suggestion was that households with a gross income above £60,000 shouldn't qualify for social housing.

The Government's Localism Act has given local authorities the ability to choose renewable tenancies instead.

'We have had another lady who married a very nicely-off gentleman,' said Ms Leighton-Boyce.

'They chose to live in their council house but he has another property, has a house abroad, a yacht abroad.

In January Gareth and Catherine Bull scooped £41million but the couple said they had 'no plans' to move out of their home

'Tenants were quite miffed about this and said why can't you do anything? Why are you still allowing them to live there?' she said.

'Under the current rules they have their tenancies for life,' she said.

The council's rainbow political alliance are expected to decide about tenancy issues at their next executive on November 8.

Tory Councillor Debbie Young, former cabinet member for housing, said renewable five-year tenancies would allow these situations to be reviewed.

'This lottery guy has highlighted the issue that people don't have to give up their properties even when they don't need them,' Mrs Young said.

'Surely this person's conscience should be pricked now?'

In 2010 the Daily Mail revealed that 43,000 social households earn more
than £50,000 a year - at a time when more than 4million people in real 
need were on waiting lists.

Under reforms implemented in February last year, the scandal of people living in taxpayer-funded council homes, despite earning tens of thousands of pounds a year, was brought to a close.

Ministers confirmed that council housing for life would no longer be possible for new tenants, with people being asked to sign shorter tenancies to enable them to be thrown out if their salary rises too high.

And the government introduced new 'affordable rents', set at different rates according to how much the tenant can pay.

But the lifetime rules do not apply to those well-off tenants living on existing tenancies - which means thousands of wealthier people can still enjoy their council properties.

In January, Gareth and Catherine Bull from Nottinghamshire scooped £41million but the couple said they had 'no plans' to quit work or move out of their home, which is not a council house.

Mr Bull, a self-employed builder, and Mrs Bull, who works in health insurance, said their home was already their 'dream home' and they did not want to move.

They announced they would splash out on one particular luxury - a new carpet for their upstairs landing.

When Matt Topham and his fiancée Cassey Carrington won £45million on the lottery in February, they said they would buy themselves the home of their dreams.

Surprisingly, the couple bought a small £249,000 house on a cul-de-sac in Nottinghamshire.

The 22-year-olds were said to be 'delighted' with their new home, despite living between a housing estate on side side and a busy main road on the other.
