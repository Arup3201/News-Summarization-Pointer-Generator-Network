Ched Evans maintained his claims of ‘absolute innocence’ of rape yesterday hours after his pre-dawn release from jail.

A statement on a website set up to clear the footballer’s name insisted again he had been a victim of a ‘gross miscarriage of justice’.

And his family said they were confident an application to the Criminal Cases Review Committee for a second appeal would succeed.

Ched Evans was whisked out of prison today as a statement maintaining his 'absolute innocence' appeared on a website campaigning for his conviction to be overturned

Evans jumped into the back of a blacked-out Mercedes 4x4. A witness described it as a 'synchronised movement' saying that it must have been prearranged

‘We believe that due to Ched’s profession, information that was not used by his original defence and other information that has been gathered since his conviction will in time over turn a wrongful conviction,’ they said.

The 25-year-old was bundled into a blacked-out Mercedes 4x4 shortly before 5am outside the jail where he had been held with fellow sex offenders such as TV presenter Stuart Hall.

In a carefully-staged manoeuvre, the silver Mercedes reversed at speed toward the gates of Wymott prison near Leyland in Lancashire.

The footballer’s family ordered a bouncy castle for a party to celebrate his release from prison yesterday. 

The giant inflatable was spotted outside his mother’s house in Ryhl, North Wales.

But the attention it drew from press photographers appeared to make the family change their minds before it was blown up.

The two deliverymen were told to take it away again by a woman who emerged from the house to say: ‘I’m sorry but I think we’d better cancel it.’ 

It was not clear yesterday whether Evans was to be a guest at the party.

Evans, who had served half his sentence, emerged from a side gate and was immediately bundled into the waiting vehicle. ‘It was a synchronised movement,’ an onlooker said. 

‘They must have organised it on the phone as it was all so quick. Ched dived in the back and the car sped off.’

Evans was jailed for five years in 2012 after being convicted of raping a drunken 19-year-old after a former team-mate invited her back to a hotel room in his home town of Rhyl, North Wales. 

He admitted having sex with her, but the woman told the jury she had no memory of the incident.

A steady stream of well-wishers called at his family home ahead of an expected celebration, with relatives having flown in from all over the world for the reunion.

His family lashed out over media coverage of the case as well as at rape campaigners who criticised Judy Finnigan for saying Evans should be allowed to return to his old club, Sheffield United.

Yesterday his mother, Helen Roberts, 51, who earlier in the week took to Twitter to back Miss Finnigan, continued to hit out at her son’s critics.

Shortly before he regained his freedom, she posted: ‘Thank you to every single person that has supported, took abuse and argued for Ched and my family it really has helped keep us strong.’

Evans' campaign website is being funded by the millionaire father of his girlfriend Natasha Massey (right), who is standing by him despite his conviction

The organiser of a petition calling on Sheffield United not to re-sign Evans last night revealed she had suffered online abuse – including being threatened with an acid bath.

The feminist campaigner, who uses the pseudonym Jean Hatchet, had been criticised by Evans’s family for setting up what they described in a statement as an ‘anonymous spammed petition’.

Yesterday Labour sports spokesman Clive Efford said it was not appropriate for Evans to return to professional football at all after his release.

‘There are many areas of employment where, when you’ve committed a crime like that, you are not allowed to be employed in that form of employment, and I think football is one of them, because you are a role model within a community,’ he told the BBC.
