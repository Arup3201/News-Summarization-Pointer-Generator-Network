Strictly Come Dancing favourite Susanna Reid has blasted Jeremy Paxman for suggesting dancing newsreaders should 'have their heads examined'.

The Newsnight presenter last month revealed he has rejected two invitations to join the celebrity line up on the BBC's flagship show, adding he would pay good money not to watch his colleagues perform.

But Miss Reid has hit back at his comments, urging him to think again about competing.

Hit back: BBC Breakfast presenter Miss Reid doesn't understand why Jeremy Paxman would turn Strictly down

Although the strict timetable has meant time away from her children, Miss Reid loves the outfits and routines

She has had varying reactions to her dances from the judges - some weeks applause, others bottom of the table

Miss Reid has praised her partner Kevin Clifton for being a role model for her three sons and all young boys

Paxman told Steve Wright on BBC Radio 2: 'They're making t*** of themselves.'

But today Miss Reid said: 'I would say to anybody who is offered the chance to appear on Strictly that they should grab it with both hands because it is the most fantastic, intense, enjoyable, wonderful experience.

'I don't understand how anyone would ever turn it down, but obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion about the people who do it.'

She added that her dance partner, Kevin, is a good role model for young boys, including her own sons, Sam, 11, Finn, nine, and Jack, eight.

Not alone: Miss Reid, here with colleague Bill Turnball who has also danced on the BBC1 show, is the latest in a number of newsreaders, journalists and politicians to take to the stage on television

This year Sian Williams, Sophie Rayworth, and Emily Maitlis joined Miss Reid for Children In Need

The BBC Breakfast presenter is the bookmakers favourite to win the all-women final of this year's competition tomorrow night.

She is the latest in a number of newsreaders and journalists to take to the Strictly or Children In Need dancefloor.

This year Emily Maitlis, Sophie Rayworth, Fiona Bruce and Kate Silverton joined Miss Reid in glittery gowns to dance for charity.

Natasha Kaplinsky, former BBC Breakfast presenter, was the inaugural winner of Strictly Come Dancing in 2004, with her partner Brendan Cole.

Heavyweight: John Sergeant, the BBC's former chief political correspondent and Politics Editor for ITN, competed in the show in 2008

Political stage: Former Tory politician Ann Widdecombe became renowned for less-than-perfect performances

Some of the shows most notorious contestants include John Sergeant, former chief political correspondent for the BBC and ITN, and Ann Widdecombe, former Tory MP.

Sian Williams, another Breakfast presenter who now fronts shows for Radio 4, gushed earlier this year about how she wanted to accept a place on the show but her sons persuaded her not to.

And on Halloween, Jeremy Paxman's fellow Newsnight presenter Kirsty Walk performed a rendition of Michael Jackson's Thriller at the end of the political show.

Tomorrow night, Miss Reid will compete against singer Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Coronation Street actress Natalie Gumede, and model Abbey Clancy, in the final at 6.30pm on BBC One.

Controversy: Last night Tory politician Deborah Dunleavy (right) caused uproar by tweeting that she wanted to 'slap' Miss Reid. She has since removed the comment after being accused of condoning domestic violence

But despite forecasts for the presenter to take home the glitterball trophy, Miss Reid has raised eyebrows along the way with flirty interview techniques and racy dances.

Last night, a prospective Tory candidate for the European parliament sparked controversy by suggesting on Twitter she wanted to give Miss Reid a 'slap'.

Deborah Dunleavy, 49, has withdrawn her message after being accused of condoning domestic violence.
