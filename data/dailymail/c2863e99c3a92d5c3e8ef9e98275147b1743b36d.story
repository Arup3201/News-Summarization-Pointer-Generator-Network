Reforms: Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his speech in Ankara where he announced a relaxation of a ban on headscarves

Turkey has taken the first step towards ending the country's long-standing ban on headscarves for women sitting in Parliament and working in the civil service.

The reform of the rule on Islamic dress, which dates back to the early days of the Turkish Republic, is potentially incendiary, pitching the government against the secular elite.

It follows a summer of persistent, sometimes violent demonstrations in Turkey's biggest towns and cities, involving protesters who have accused the country's leaders of following an Islamist agenda.

Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan unveiled the proposal on headscarves yesterday as part of a big package of long-delayed liberalising reforms.

It will lift a ban preventing women in public offices from wearing Islamic dress, except in those jobs that require uniforms such as the military and security services, and the courts.

In the past the ban has kept many women from joining the public work force, contributing to a relatively low female employment rate which has been regarded as one of the Turkey's economic weaknesses.

But the issue has exacerbated tension between religious and secular elites, one of the major fault lines in Turkish public life.

Erdogan has already eased the ban on head scarves at universities and religious schools, drawing fierce criticism from secularists who see the government pushing an Islamic agenda.

Tear gas enveloped Turkey's streets in June and July in a fierce crackdown on mass demonstrations against Mr Erdogan's AK Party, which has been accused of creeping authoritarianism.

Police used tear gas and rubber

Istanbul town centre development and grew amid widespread anger at 
economic reforms.

Many were
also angry at Mr Erdogan's moves to curtail the power of the military 
which, like its counterpart in Egypt, has long been the guardian of the 
country's secular values, toppling four governments in four decades.

Four people were killed and 7,500 wounded in last summer's police crackdown, according to the Turkish Medical Association.

In a wide-ranging, major policy speech yesterday Mr Erdogan also announced reforms designed to salvage a peace process aimed at ending a conflict with Kurdish insurgents.

Turkey's Kurds, who make up around a fifth of the country's 76million population, have for many years been denied political rights, leading to one of Europe's longest-running, and most under-reported ethnic conflicts.

Changes to the electoral system, a broadening of language rights and permission for villages to reinstate their original Kurdish names were all proposed in an effort to extend a hand to separatists.

Turkey's human rights record has been badly tarnished by its handling of the insurgency by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has crippled the economy in the mainly Kurdish south-east of the country.

More than 40,000 people have been killed in fighting since 1984.

Other reforms include allowing election campaigns to be conducted in languages other than Turkish and decriminalising the use of Kurdish letters not found in the Turkish alphabet.

All primary school students in state schools will now also no longer have to recite a deeply nationalistic vow at the start of each week, which begins with the words: 'I am a Turk'.

Mr Erdogan has invested much political capital in the peace initiative, which has drawn strong public support.

But he is increasingly attracting fierce nationalist criticism over the perceived concessions to militants who are officially labelled terrorists.

In his speech, Mr Erdogan said parliament would debate whether to reduce the threshold for a political party to enter parliament to 5 per cent of the national vote, or even eliminate the barrier completely.

The current 10 per cent threshold, among the highest in the world, has kept pro-Kurdish parties out of parliament and has been one of the main grievances of the Kurds.

Mr Erdogan said his 'democratisation package' would also allow for education in languages other than Turkish at non-state schools, another long-held demand by Kurdish politicians.

He told a news conference in Ankara: 'Today our country, our nation, is experiencing an historic moment. It is passing through a very important stage.

'We are taking important steps to make Turkey even greater.'

He added: 'Our people's greatest wish is to strengthen our domestic peace, further our social cohesion and solidarity, and fortify our tranquillity.'

While Mr Erdogan reiterated that the proposed reforms are not directly linked with efforts to end the 29-year conflict with the outlawed PKK, the changes are largely viewed as an effort to advance the flagging peace process.

But the pro-Kurdish Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) said the proposals were not enough to satisfy Kurdish militants, who this month halted their withdrawal from Turkish territory.

BDP co-chairman Gultan Kisanak said: 'The democratisation package does not meet our expectations. The package does not have the capacity to overcome blockages in the peace process.'

Ms Kisanak criticised Mr Erdogan's proposed reform on mother tongue instruction in schools as this would only apply to private fee-paying institutions.

And she reiterated the BDP's demand to eliminate the vote threshold entirely, saying any lowering of the barrier would not justly represent the votes.

Jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan and Turkish officials began peace talks almost a year ago, and in March rebels called a halt to hostilities.

The ceasefire has largely held but earlier this month the PKK warned that hostilities could resume without concrete action by the government.

The government accuses the militants of failing to live up to their side of a bargain, and Mr Erdogan has previously said only 20 per cent of the PKK fighters had withdrawn from Turkey.
