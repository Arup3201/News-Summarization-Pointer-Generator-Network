Sibling rivalry starts from a young age and for this cheeky lion cub, taunting her older siblings was way too much fun to worry about the consequences.

The feisty female, only about three-months-old quickly set about wreaking havoc after she was the first of her pride to wake from an afternoon snooze.

But while she playfully teased her older siblings, it was not long until they ganged up on her, pushed her in the mud and chased her up a tree in the Serengeti plains in Tanzania.

Wildlife photographer Elliott Neep captured the pride playtime in stunning photographs.

Mr Neep, 38, from Wantage, Oxfordshire, said: ‘It is always special to witness amazing scenes like this, and what made these images so special was the tenacity of the young cub.

‘Lions can be both the most boring and the most thrilling of animals to watch.

‘Most of the time they laze around and sleep and other times, like this, they are full of energy, chasing and fighting.’

Tenacious tot: Suddenly her siblings looked much bigger and stronger than her as they started to fight back

Mr Neep, who works as a photographic guide, said the photographs had the ‘cute factor’.

He said: ‘In terms of how I rate these photos, they are certainly up there on the cute factor alone.

‘The images of the cub biting the back of the other cub and the tail biting one are particular favourites of mine.

Bitten off more than she could chew: The cub was soon outnumbered as her siblings ganged up on her, pushing her in the mud

Boring or thrilling: Wildlife photographer Elliott Neep said lions spend a lot of time lazing about but that they also have outbursts of energy like this

‘When we arrived at the scene all was quiet and the lions were sleeping in the shade but the skies had grown increasingly heavy and rain was imminent.

‘The first lions to wake were two young cubs, who started suckling from their mother, she was in a very bad mood though and snarled at them.

‘As the young female continued to fight and chase the older cubs, they pinned her to the ground and rolled her around in the mud.

Playing on the plains: The lion pride were in the Serengeti plains in Tanzania

‘The cub was following its natural instinct when she fled to the higher ground of the tree.’

The Serengeti plains are dominated by vast short grass plains populated by wildebeest, large numbers of gazelle and predators including lions, cheetahs and leopards.

There are also lakes in the area which attract plenty of flamingos and smaller cats such as Serval and Caracal.

Habitat for many: As well as lions, the plains are home to wildebeest, gazelle and other predators such as cheetahs and leopards
