The convicted killer of 13-year-old schoolboy Daniel Morcombe spends his time confined to his maximum security jail cell as he's too scared to leave because he fears attacks by other inmates.

Brett Peter Cowan has been behind bars for eight months after being found guilty of killing and dumping Daniel's body on the Sunshine Coast in 2003.

The 45-year-old, who is set to appeal his murder conviction this month, is still considered one of Wolston Correctional Centre's most at-risk inmates, the Courier Mail reports.

Brett Peter Cowan has been behind bars for eight months after being found guilty of killing and dumping Daniel's body on the Sunshine Coast in 2003

Cowan has been in protective custody since he was sentenced and has had no visitors since his parents saw him immediately after his conviction in March.

He eats his food in his maximum security cell and only goes out for brief periods each day, which requires high level security escorts to guard him down the halls.

He is reportedly too much of a target to take a prison job like other inmates. 

Cowan was arrested in August 2011 after unknowingly confessing to Daniel's murder on camera to an undercover detetive during a covert police operation.

His defence team are set to appeal his conviction on November 27 and 28 arguing Cowan's video confession was illegal and shouldn't have been played to a jury. 

Cowan's defence is reliant on a Canadian precedent that saw a convicted murderer re-trialled after the jury was shown his video confession during his high court trial. 

'Really the centre-point of the whole argument is the admissions that Brett made to the undercover officers should never have seen the light of day,' Cowan's lawyer, Tim Meehan told Nine News.

Bruce and Denise Morcombe, who spent eight years searching for their son, said they had prepared for Cowan to appeal his conviction

'If that evidence is out, the case against Brett becomes particularly weak.'

Mr Meehan said Cowan was in good spirits due to his upcoming appeal.

'He's very happy that he's got a date, he's very keen for the appeal to run,' he said.

'It could change his life incredibly if he got a retrial.'
