The childhood home of Charles Dickens - situated just yards from a former workhouse thought to have inspired Oliver Twist - has gone on sale for £760,000.

The second-floor London flat was lodged in by John and Elizabeth Dickens in 1815, when their talented son Charles was just three years old.

The family left the property, above a grocer’s shop, a year later, but the author returned to the street as a teenager between 1828 and 1831.

The one-bedroom flat in Cleveland Street, Bloomsbury, has an original Georgian fireplace in the main room where the young Dickens is thought to have kept warm.

The property, which is for sale through agents LDG, has large rooms, modern wooden floors and double-glazed sash windows.

The author, who was the second of eight children, learned reading, writing and shorthand while living in the building and also used the address to apply for a reader’s ticket at the British Museum.

Returning after his father’s imprisonment for debt, Dickens  sought to establish his independence at the property.

Most other buildings linked to the author in Central London no longer exist.

The building was Dickens’s first London residence after his young family moved to the city from Portsmouth.

He went on to spend much of his life living in different parts of what is now the borough of Camden, but unlike Cleveland Street, many of the original roads and buildings are no longer recognisable.

Also in Bloomsbury is the Charles Dickens Museum - a house in which the author lived between 1837 and 1839.

The one-bedroom second-floor property is near to Soho and Regents Park and is currently on the market at £760,000

The Grade II listed property is located in Fitzrovia - a trendy part of central London littered with small pubs and restaurants

Laurence Glynne of estate agents LDG, who manage the property, said: 'It’s fascinating to think what Dickens would have made of the Fitzroy Place development across the road, where flats are being sold off-plan for £2,000 per square foot'

For the five years that he lived in this street, Dickens could not ignore the presence of the Cleveland Street Workhouse upon his doorstep - as the fate that he struggled to avoid.

The impression it made upon him inspired one of his greatest novels - Oliver Twist, published in 1837.

Just ten doors away stands the former workhouse, built in the 1770s to accommodate the poor. The site has been used as a hospital for most of its existence.

In its early days, local people bemoaned the inhumanity of the workhouse, praying that they never had cause to throw themselves on its cold charity.

As a toddler and teenager, the author would have watched the sorry procession of starving, destitute people make their way to the workhouse gates to beg for admittance.

He would have seen girls and boys of only six years old bundled into carts and transported like cattle, often hundreds of miles away, to work in the factories and mills of Britain’s industrial heartlands. 

There they would be beaten as they laboured 16 hours a day in exchange for a few spoonfuls of gruel.

In Oliver Twist, eponymous character Oliver is forced to endure a miserable orphan's existence in a workhouse before being placed in the care of an undertaker and then escaping to London.

Also thought to have inspired Oliver Twist was the traumatic episode of Dickens's life when his father was imprisoned for debt and he was sent to work in a factory to support the family at just 12 years old.
