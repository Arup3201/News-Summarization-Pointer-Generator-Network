The father of Nicole Brown Simpson has passed away aged 91 after battling Alzheimer's for several years, one of his daughters has revealed.

Lou Brown, whose ex son-in-law O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of killing his daughter in 1994, still thought she was alive in his later years and would call her name, a source told RadarOnline.

'Every so often heâ€™d suddenly call out, "Nicole, are you there? Where's Nicole?"' the source claimed. 'It was heartbreaking... He went to his grave thinking she was still alive.'

Mr Brown, a World War II veteran, passed away at 3.40am on Thursday surrounded by his wife, Judith, and his daughters, one of the women, Denise Brown, told Radar.

Loss: Nicole Brown Simpson's father, Lou Brown (pictured left with his wife, daughters and lawyer in the 1990s), has passed away aged 91 after battling Alzheimer's for years, his daughter Denise revealed

'Unfortunately to most people, he will be
 forever known as O.J. Simpson's ex father-in-law, but he was so much 
more,' Denise said. 'Obviously I am heartbroken that he is gone, but 
happy at the same time. He is in a better place and he is no longer 
suffering.'

The family were pictured at the murder and civil trial for Brown's ex-husband, actor and former NFL star O.J. Simpson, who was accused of stabbing her to death at their home in 1994.

Simpson and Nicole Brown had married in 1985 and had two children, Sydney and Justin. In 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson and the couple ultimately divorced in 1992.

On June 12, 1994, she and her friend Ron Goldman were found killed at her Los Angeles home and Simpson was accused of the crimes.

On June 17, the day Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police, the former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California.

Simpson finally surrendered to police and the internationally publicized trial lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'.

In 1995, the disgraced NFL star was acquitted of the 1994 murders.

After the case, Mr Brown was calm about the verdict and vowed not to fight for the couple's children, if Simpson wanted them back, simply stating that in-fighting was bad for any family.

His daughter Denise said he was active in domestic violence organizations following Nicole's death.

Locked up: In this interview in 2004, Simpson said he hopes the real killer is found so that he can have the pleasure of proving people wrong. He is now serving time for kidnapping and armed robbery in 2007

In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room.

Simpson was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison.

The Brown family said that funeral and burial arrangements are pending, but a source told Radar that Mr Brown wanted to be buried next to Nicole.
