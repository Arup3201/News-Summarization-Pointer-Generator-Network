On trial: Asil Nadir arrives at the Old Bailey, London, with his wife, Nur

It has been nearly 19 years since he famously fled British justice.

But yesterday Asil Nadir finally went on trial for allegedly stealing £150million to fund his luxury lifestyle.

The 70-year-old is accused of plundering his Polly Peck business empire to pay for lavish properties, cars and gifts for himself and his family, causing the firm to collapse nearly 22 years ago.

The tycoon, who had at his disposal 
five company cars including Bentleys and a Ferrari Testarossa, as well 
as a company aeroplane, then fled as fraud investigators closed in. On 
the eve of his trial in May 1993 he jetted off to his native Northern 
Cyprus where he set up home.

It
was not until August 2010 that Nadir flew back to London and was 
re-arrested. Yesterday the former fugitive entered the Old Bailey 
grinning as he prepared to go into the dock for the first time to face 
13 charges of theft.

Nadir 
stopped to shake hands and wave at supporters after arriving in a 
presidential-style cavalcade. He was flanked by minders and accompanied 
by his glamorous second wife Nur, 27.

The
defendant sat calmly as the court heard how he raided the firm's 
accounts to splash out on a string of million pound properties and 
luxuries such as a new Mercedes for his first wife Ayshegul, cash for 
his son Birol and livestock for a 'model farm' on a country estate in 
Leicestershire.

He even used the stolen cash to pay off his tax bill and debts, it was alleged.

Nadir
is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to 
£33million and $2.5million. But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, said the 
'much bigger picture' was that he stole £146million and $6.4million in a
total of 64 transfers.

The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and August 1990 from three accounts held by Polly Peck International (PPI), a major international conglomerate which had more than 200 subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure and housed the Del Monte fruit business.

Nadir is said to have ordered his henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from banks which he 'dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family or associates'.

Mr Shears told jurors: 'Mr Nadir was chairman and chief executive of PPI. He was a man who wielded very considerable power over its operations and management and that of its subsidiaries, particularly in Northern Cyprus.

'We say he abused that power and helped himself to tens of millions of pounds of PPI's money.

'The time span of the counts is 
between 1987 and 1990. That is a long time ago. Why are we trying 
matters so long ago? The answer is simple. He was due to stand his trial
in late 1993 but in May of 1993 he fled the country to Northern Cyprus,
thus leaving the jurisdiction, only to return in August 2010.

'The funds were used in a variety of ways for the benefit of Nadir himself, his family and his associates.'

The jury heard that Nadir hid 
£7.5million he siphoned off from his firm in his mother, Safiye's, bank 
accounts. The rest of the stolen cash went through a complex series of 
transactions through companies in Switzerland and the Bahamas and a bank
he owned in Northern Cyprus, it was said.

When the company folded owing more 
than £550million, administrators found that the vast majority of cash 
was held in Northern Cyprus.

By December 1989, £202.6million – 81 
per cent of all Polly Peck's cash balances – was held by its Turkish and
Northern Cyprus companies. By the end of June 1990 this had risen to 
£305.8million.

When questioned about the cash 
transfers, Nadir allegedly told his board it made good business sense 
and that he needed to pay citrus growers for produce.

Shortly before the firm collapsed in 
October 1990, Nadir increased his salary from £200,000 to £350,000, the 
court heard. Mr Shears said: 'When the administrators went to Northern 
Cyprus they effectively found no cash at all, just a black hole. We say 
there is a perfectly good explanation for that – it had gone. Mr Nadir 
had stolen it.'

The jury heard that Nadir was the 
dominant force in the company which he built up from an ailing textiles 
firm in the early 1980s.

Mr Shears said: 'He directed its 
affairs in an autocratic manner and refused to tolerate rival sources of
power in the management or to accept constraints upon his freedom of 
action.'

Unlike other businesses, PPI operated 
with a single signatory system where only one member of the board could 
authorise the transfer of funds as Nadir refused to 'surrender the power
to transfer funds'.

But he relied on help from his alleged
accomplice, Elizabeth Forsyth, his 'personal financial officer' who was
managing director of South Audley Management (SAM) which ran most of 
the money transactions. Jason Davies, another director of SAM, also 
'provided assistance to Nadir in his dishonest enterprise', the court 
heard.

They allegedly worked together to help
Nadir use PPI money to secretly buy £26.2million in PPI shares to prop 
up its share price, which allowed the company to borrow more from banks,
helped maintain the value of Nadir's own shareholding and prevented 
lenders forcing the sale of his personal stock.

The court heard that Nadir also used the cash to invest in businesses he owned or controlled.

They included a newspaper and 
publishing company in Northern Cyprus, a Swiss computer firm he used to 
get a Swiss residence permit, a Turkish airline, Baggrave Farm – a 
country estate in  Leicestershire – and Burley on the Hill, a hotel 
development project in Rutland.

Nadir, of Belgravia, denies 13 counts of theft. The trial continues.
