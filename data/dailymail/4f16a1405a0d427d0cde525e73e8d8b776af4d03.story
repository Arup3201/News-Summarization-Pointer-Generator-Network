Season after season, Burberry's Christopher Bailey unveils the most coveted catwalk collection - and his AW15 womenswear show today was no different.

Named Patchwork, Pattern & Prints, Burberry is bringing back bohemian style for AW15 with a print-filled show nostalgic of the 70s.

The show at Kensington Gardens opened with the dulcet tones of singer-songwriter Clare Maguire, who had written a song specifically for the show.

Named Patchwork, Pattern & Prints, Burberry is bringing back bohemian style for AW15 with a print-filled show nostalgic of the 70s closed by hot young models Malaika Firth and Edie Campbell

Supermodels Cara Delevingne, Jourdan Dunn, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell may have taken a break from the catwalk to admire the collection from the front row but that wasn't to say Bailey didn't tap the rest of the cool young Brit pack. 

Whilst last season's favourite Suki Waterhouse was partying at the Oscars in Los Angeles with beau Bradley Cooper, Malaika Firth closed the show with aplomb.

Mosaic-encrusted tops,  patchwork leggings and a new take on the classic trench rocked the runway

The collection also included several floaty peasant style dresses that finished below the knee

Coats were trimmed with the softest shearling and the bucket bag came in leopard or decked in fringing 

Following closely behind was the biggest clothes horses in the business, Sam Rollinson, Edie Campbell and Matilda Lowther, all dressed head-to-toe in the British heritage label's latest offering.

This time last year, Bailey introduced the poncho - and a who's who of fashion wore their personalised versions all season long.

Known for his ability to reinvent trends time and time again, he updated it for AW15 with the help of some fashionable fringing - and Kate Moss arrived wearing a black version before it had even hit the runway.

The collection saw some of Christopher Bailey's signature graphic prints that he has favoured over the past few seasons of the Burberry Prorsum catwalk

Tassels were omnipresent on Bailey's runway and patchwork print boots were seen on the runway and on the front row (worn by none other than Cara Delevingne) 

The collection carried a folklore feel with models' dainty outfits completed with pompoms round the wrist

The poncho has become a new classic for the brand with this season seeing embellishment to the capes

The soft outline was first seen at the fashion house a year ago with the monogrammed blankets

Suede and leather fringing was a theme throughout the line and even the models' shoes were complete with a tasseled edging

For the braver Burberry girl full-length fringing was seen on several models in tan and plum shades

Mosaic-encrusted tops and dresses were worn with black waistcoats and fringed booties sashayed down the runway

Burberry's new arm candy, the bucket bag, was given a fringed makeover, as were the brand's winter ponytail booties.

The staple trench, meanwhile, came with paisley prints in blossom hues, while teal and olive maxi dresses made a comeback and were worn with the tiniest of waistcoats.

Mosaic-encrusted tops, quilted floral jackets, and patchwork leggings rocked the runway, with the occasional injection of leopard-print making a graphic statement.

Today's show, which closed with a shower of metallic confetti, was boho Burberry at its absolute best.
