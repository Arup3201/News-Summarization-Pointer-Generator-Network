Toronto Uber users accustomed to black sedans and plain taxis were shocked this week to see Deadmau5 pull up in a McLaren 650S this week to give them a ride.

The famous Canadian house music producer tweeted that on Sept. 4 that he would be signing up as an Uber driver for fun, and followed through on his promise this week.

If their brush with celebrity wasn't enough to excite them, they should have been thrilled by the car itself, as the V-8 powered engine is capable of hitting 60 mph in under 3 seconds.

The EDM star promised to sign up as an Uber driver a week before starting to pick people up and said he would keep the app handy for when he got bored

Deadmau5's stint with Uber should also have been a good distraction from his legal battle with Disney, who want him to stop using his trademarked logo of a giant mouse head with crossed-out eyes.

Jalopnik reported on the musician's first few fares, including one man who just wanted to pick up some food at Chipotle.

'Burger King bought Tim Horton's for eleven billion dollars,' he says at one point. 'What do you do with that?'

It seem the experience went well enough that the EDM star could be back on the streets again soon.

'lol, well that as fun...' he tweeted after finishing his shift. 'gunna keep the app handy...never know when i get bored n might wanna go out for a spin. thanks @Uber_TOR.'
