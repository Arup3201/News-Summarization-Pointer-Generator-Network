It features drug-lord teacher Walter White, his former partner Jesse Pinkman and other familiar faces.

Tribute: James Allan spent more than £2,000 getting Breaking Bad's main characters tattooed on his right arm

Familiar face: The hyper-realistic tribute features drug-lord teacher, Walter White, played by Bryan Cranston

Portrayal: It also depicts the faces of lawyer, Saul Goodman (bottom in left image), portrayed by Bob Odenkirk

It also depicts blue methamphetamine, dollar bills and the show's logo, while a series of police badges connect the character's faces.

Mr Allan, an electrician, said he was delighted with the high-quality tribute to the U.S. drama, which has captivated fans across the world since its launch in 2008.

'The realism of it is crazy. I like tattoos and I've been looking to get a sleeve for a while, but I wasn't sure what at first,' he said.

'The
 tattoo includes the most important elements from the show. There are 
four colour portraits that are connected with further details.

Resemblance: It also depicts Walter White's former partner, Jesse Pinkman, who is portrayed by Aaron Paul

'It is
 obviously my favourite show and I have watched the series from the first 
day it came on the TV about five years ago. I eventually decided to do a
 sleeve.

'I have spent a couple of thousand pounds of my own money on it and it has taken 40 hours.'

He added: 'I will not regret it when I'm older. You make choices and you live by them. It is just one of these things.

Difference: Mr Allan had the tattoo printed on his arm to cover up a tribal tattoo (left) he previously had done

Mr Allan said he had decided to get the unusual artwork done after his tattoo artist friend, Chris Meighan, 34, appealed for a live canvas on Facebook.

He chose to get it printed on his right arm to cover up a tribal tattoo he had previously had done without having to undergo laser surgery.

 Hyper-realistic tattoos are inkings that are designed to look as realistic as possible.

They may feature skilled drawings of people and objects, or employ special techniques, such as shading or 3D effects.

Popular hyper-realistic images include those of bullet wounds, insects crawling on the skin and the body's interior.

Chris Meighan, owner of Studio 52 tattoo parlour in Stirling, said such tattoos were becoming increasingly popular in Britain.

'Colour realism portraits are big in the U.S., but a lot of people now want them in the UK as well,' he said.

'It is exactly like traditional tattooing, but a lot is more possible now. People can have whatever they want.'

'I already had a tattoo on my arm. It was a tribal that I got at a house party when I was 17 from my pal's dad,' he said.

'At
 the time it was macho with the big tribal thing, but I started to hate 
it. When you see a tribal it makes you think, "how many people have 
actually been in a tribe?"

'I
 had been to a few tattooists around Scotland and asked them if they 
could cover it up, because I really didn't want to get laser surgery.

'Chris
 was confident enough in his ability that he would be able to cover it up. 
Now it is hardly even there. You can't even see the old tattoo anymore.'

Breaking
 Bad tells the story of struggling high school chemistry teacher Walter 
White - also known as Heisenberg - who is diagnosed with inoperable lung
 cancer.

He turns to a life 
of crime, producing and selling methamphetamine in order to secure his 
family's financial future before he dies.

Mr
 Allan's tribute tattoo shows White alongside other main characters from
 the show, including Jesse Pinkman, gangster Gus Fring and crooked 
lawyer Saul Goodman.

Today, Mr Meighan, who owns Studio 52 tattoo parlour, said hyper-realistic tattoos are becoming increasingly popular in Britain.

'Colour realism portraits are big in the U.S. but a lot of people now want them in the UK as well,' he said.

'It is artwork really. It is exactly the same as traditional tattooing, but a lot more is possible now.

'Tattooing has come a long way in the last eight years and it hass changed. People can have whatever they want, instead of choosing something from a book.'

He added: 'Tattooing is just like painting on skin. I have got an art degree but I didn't use it for a long time, until I fell into tattooing four years ago. I tattoo the same way that I paint or draw.'
