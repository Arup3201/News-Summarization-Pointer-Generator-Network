They already had a strained relationship with their  ‘vulnerable’ daughter.

And the elderly couple’s troubles mounted after she apparently arrived in a taxi and told them she was moving in.

Peter and Betty Smith later walked a short distance from their home and stepped in front of a speeding freight train.

Witnesses said the driver sounded the horn for up to a minute as he approached them at an unmanned level crossing.

Level crossing: The scene where a couple died after being hit by a train in Cherry Willingham, Lincolnshire

Probe: Officers and rail workers at the scene of the incident where British Transport Police are investigating

Yesterday, neighbours in the picturesque Lincolnshire village of Cherry Willingham said the couple’s apparent suicide pact followed problems with their 50-year-old daughter Jane.

Geoff Walpole, 70, who lives two doors away, said: ‘I heard that their daughter arrived with her partner recently by taxi and told them she was going to live there.’

He added that there was a ‘big row’ on the day retired postman Mr Smith, 80, died along with his 78-year-old wife.

Residents near their daughter’s home in Lincoln, where she lived with boyfriend Tim Evans, described heated exchanges whenever her father visited her.

One, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He used to do the garden for her, and look after the house, clean the windows, do the shopping and then she turned on him about that. He always had to sit outside in  the car.’ 

Another neighbour, Christine Wearing, 72, said: ‘Peter was such a placid man – he was a real gentleman. He was just such a patient man and did everything for his daughter.’

Mr and Mrs Smith are understood to have told their daughter, who used to work as a children’s nurse, that they were going to the shops on the morning they died.

A local shop owner said: ‘I spoke to the daughter this morning. She had moved back in recently but I don’t know why.

The couple left their bungalow after reportedly telling their daughter they were getting Mr Smith's glasses fixed

Remembered: This morning a floral tribute was placed close to where the tragedy occurred in Lincolnshire

‘Peter had problems with his glasses. They were hurting his head. So they told their daughter they were catching the bus into town to get them fixed.

‘That’s when they did it. I’ve known them for 50 years.  It’s so sad.’

Mr Smith and his wife, a former hairdresser, walked on to the railway line shortly before midday  on Wednesday.

The crossing has a 12ft wide metal gate. Drivers have to ring the main signal box for clearance to open the gates and cross, but pedestrians are able to walk across using a stile.

Residents said that the crossing was used regularly and had a good safety record.

The freight train, which was travelling from Lincoln city centre to Immingham Dock in Humberside, came to a halt at another level crossing 500 yards away, a short distance from a secondary school where pupils were taking part in their sports day.

A card on flowers left at the scene this morning stated: 'A love to last eternity. Together forever. RIP xx'

Services between Lincoln and Grimsby were halted for three hours before resuming in  the afternoon.

Paramedics from the East Midlands Ambulance Service arrived at the scene but the couple were pronounced dead.

The Smith family said in a statement yesterday: ‘We are deeply saddened by our loss.’

British Transport Police said officers were ‘working to establish the full circumstances of the incident, which is currently being treated as non-suspicious’.

The Rail Accident Investigation Branch has been informed and the Central Lincolnshire Coroner is expected to open inquests in the next few days.
