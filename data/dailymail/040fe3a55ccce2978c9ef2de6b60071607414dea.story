A revolutionary new concept developed by Lewis Hamilton's father is to be put through its paces  in Abu Dhabi.

Dubbed 'Info Wing', the LED display system sits on top of the air intake above the driver's head and primarily provides race-position data.

Using information supplied by race control, data can also be displayed as to who has set the fastest lap, tyre strategy and flag condition via multiple colours.

The LED system, designed by F1 driver Lewis Hamilton's father, sits on top of the air intake section of the car

The wing can display a variety of messages as well as transmitting race positional data back to the pit lane

The FIA is to initially test the Info Wing on the safety car during its assessment runs of the Yas Marina circuit, either on Thursday or Friday.

Force India will run a further test of the unit on top of their car next Tuesday on the first day of a two-day test that follows Sunday's season-ending grand prix. Anthony Hamilton said: 'The test is to decide whether the unit is practical for F1 and single seaters.

'Also, whether the LED display can be seen from the grandstands, and whether it works for the TV audience.

'The idea behind the system is to provide race-position data plus other race information to the viewing public.

'One of the major problems with watching race cars is knowing who is where and who is who without having to take your eyes off the action to find and locate the information on a hand-held device, or one of the circuit monitors.

'By the time you have found the information the car has gone past and you're no better off, and having missed the action as well.

'It might not work. We might not be able to see the LEDs in the bright sunlight, but it is the concept I hope could be of interest.

'It might require further work on the intensity of the LEDs, but I believe this has the potential to make a huge impact on the viewing of races and tests, making it more informative and enjoyable.

'Hopefully it could bring new fans to the sport, and old fans back as well.'

Patent pending, the MkII prototype will run in Abu Dhabi, with a MkIII version currently in development.

That design incorporates a new-shaped camera mount and a double-LED display that incorporates not only race-position data, but also the first three letters of a driver's surname.

Anthony Hamilton is also developing a version for DTM (German touring cars), Indy Cars, NASCAR, karting and motor bikes.
