This fearless adventurer appears so relaxed while dangling precariously above a waterfall that he's even able to have a lie down.  

Ethan Holt carefully inches his way along a 100ft-long slackline as water from the Deschutes River in Oregon, US, gushes past him below.

He has to ensure the loud noise from the plunging water surrounding him doesn't detract from his intense concentration.

Ethan Holt somehow manages to lie down on the slackline suspended 30ft above the Deschutes River, appearing relaxed as he does so

He inches his way carefully across the 100ft slackline as he prepares to perform the incredible stunt, seemingly without a care in the world 

But the daredevil can't retain his balance forever and ends up having to dive into the water 30ft below after slipping off the wire

But as the daredevil appears to stop for a spot of meditation on his back, somehow managing to balance amid the spray and the din from the water, his poise finally deserts him and he has to dive into the spectacular pool 30ft below.

The amazing moment was captured by keen snapper Brian Mosbaugh, 30.

He said: 'Being in such a beautiful location certainly makes slacklining very tranquil and meditative.

'However the challenge of walking over water and very close to the waterfall creates a lot of visual distraction and movement.

'This can make it a lot harder to maintain balance and composure, especially since there's mist in the air.

Keen photographer Brian Mosbaugh, 30, captured this series of incredible images of Holt in action high above the churning water

The adventurer appears totally unperturbed by the spray and the loud noise of the gushing water around him as he balances on the wire

Holt had to get himself into position to perform the lie down which is no mean feat in itself, having to creep carefully across the 100ft wire

The slackline is in a canyon with many different geological layers of conglomerate rock and sandstone surrounding the churning river

Snapper Brian describes the spot as one of his favourite slacklining locations in the world, and often protects it by not telling people where it is

'The scenery is constantly moving with water so it's difficult to focus, which makes Ethan's skills that much more honed and impressive.'

The slackline is in a canyon of many different geological layers of conglomerate rock and sandstone.

Brian added: 'The cliff band changes as you get deeper into the canyon.

'With the river cutting through the landscape it has formed this incredible waterfall and cliff jumping location.

'The scenery is breath-taking and full of all sorts of different species of bird, deer and other wildlife wondering around freely.

'It's one of my favourite slacklining locations in the world.

'I don't often divulge the exact location in order to protect the area from being overdeveloped and polluted.'

It is one of his favourite slacklining spots in the world, so he rarely divulges its exact location in order to protect it
