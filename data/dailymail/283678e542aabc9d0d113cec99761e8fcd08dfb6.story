A British explorer is celebrating leading a team of cavers to the lowest depth ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere.

Chris Jewell, 31, spent seven weeks with his group navigating the Sistema Huautla cave system in Mexico, one of the most remote places ever reached inside the earth.

Located in Sierra Mazatec mountains, the cave system has 17 entrances and endless different routes into the centre.

Jewell's group, made up of 40 
people from around the world, managed to dive, swim, climb and descend 
through a labyrinth of pitch black tunnels.

They had the gruelling task of 
navigating eerie, water-filled abysses known as sumps.

At one stage 
swam underwater in darkness for 600 metres in a 28 metre deep river.

During these dives, the group had no knowledge of where they were heading.

Team member Jason Mallinson, from Huddersfield, reached the depth of 
1,545 metres, the deepest anyone has been in the Western Hemisphere - 
and the eighth deepest in history.

The group beat the previous record of 1,484 metres set nearby
 in the Cheve caves while the previous record in Sistema Huautla was 
1,475 metres.

The experience is a far cry from Chris Jewell's day job, where he works an office-based software consultant in Manchester.

For the expedition, Chris managed to negotiate nine weeks' unpaid leave.

He said: 'You don't know what is happening in front of you but we traced the water's route to a canyon seven miles away.

'We knew where it is heading but we didn't know what was between. It is genuine exploration and it is really exciting.

The team spent up to ten nights underground at a time, sleeping in the cave 
and scuba diving flooded tunnels.

In the Sistema Huautla cave system, the cavers went without seeing any natural light for 10 days at a time

He described his once in a life time 
experience: 'You don't feel the depth underground, but you are aware of 
the remoteness and that you're two days away from sunlight.

'It is quite tranquil and eerie in places, but it is also very noisy in others because of the fast-flowing river.'

The largest underwater sump was 600 metres long and 28 metres deep while
 the last sump reached was 440 metres long and 81 metres deep.

Team members came from the UK, USA, Canada, Poland and Mexico, working 
tirelessly to haul ropes, camping equipment and scuba gear up and down.

They set the record around three weeks into the exploration, before spending the next four weeks removing all their gear.

First, the cave drivers had to swim 600 metres underwater through two flooded tunnels to reach their advance camp.

They then spent one week exploring 'sump 9' and looking for a way 
to bypass the flooded tunnel which represents the current end of the 
system.

It was sump 9 where Jason reached the record depth, with the explorers going without natural light for more than ten days.

840 metres below the surface the team prepare their dive equipment, which weighed 500 kg

The group managed to beat the previous record of 1,484 metres set nearby in the Cheve caves

In total, they took 500kg of equipment for the trip, when they set off on February 28.

Chris added: 'It was incredibly deep and incredibly remote. It was a 
challenge and adventure and it was physically very demanding.

'At the time the depth wasn't the most important thing, we were just pleased we ran a safe and smooth operation'
