Allegations that members of an ‘Establishment’ paedophile ring sexually abused boys in council care during the 1980s are to be investigated by police, it emerged yesterday.

Former ministers, senior MPs, top police officers and those with links to the royal household are alleged to have indecently assaulted vulnerable, under-age males.

Claims that showbusiness celebrities were part of the same ring will also be investigated.

According to reports, the inquiry will focus on boys who were living at Grafton Close children’s home in Richmond, South-West London, in the 1980s.

Allegations of child abuse in the early 1980s at the Elm Guest House, in Barnes, London were made by Tom Watson MP in the House of Commons

It is claimed the boys were taken from 
Grafton Close to Elm Guest House in Rocks Lane, a suburban street in 
nearby Barnes where they were subjected to appalling sexual abuse.

One source is said to have suggested that Anthony Blunt, former Keeper 
of the Queen’s Pictures and an exposed Soviet spy, used to go to sordid 
parties at the guest house.

Others are said to have spoken of two High 
Court judges and a Foreign Office official attending. Detectives 
launched the probe, codenamed Operation Fernbridge, after they obtained a
 list of ‘prominent people’ who allegedly stayed at the guest house in 
the 1980s.

The list is reported to have been compiled by a veteran child
 protection campaigner.

Grafton Close shut more than 20 years ago and police were keen to stress
 that the abuse claims are historic and are not linked with the current 
occupants of Elm Guest House, which has been converted into flats.

Allegations over Elm Guest House first emerged at a 1990 inquest into the suicide of its German manager Carole Kasir.

A Met Police inquiry, 
called Operation Fernbridge, is under way into allegations about child 
abuse in the early 1980s

Child protection campaigners said at the hearing that in 1988 she told 
them boys from council-run Grafton Close had been taken to the 
guesthouse and abused.

Mrs Kasir had a 1982 conviction for running a brothel. But campaigners 
said the manager had no idea at the time of the child abuse.

Officers working on the probe are said to be liaising with Labour MP Tom
 Watson, who told the Commons in October that politicians belonging to a
 paedophile network had used their powerful connections to escape 
justice.

He sensationally claimed a ‘senior aide of a former prime 
minister’ had links to a member of a child sex ring.

He added that a file of evidence used to convict a man called Peter 
Righton of importing child pornography in 1992 contained ‘clear 
intelligence’ of a sex abuse gang.

Peter Righton, a leading consultant on children's homes who was found guilty of pornographic offences. Mr Watson MP said the file used to convict him could contain new evidence

Raising the issue during Prime Minister’s Questions, Mr Watson said: 
‘The leads were not followed up, but if the file still exists I want to 
ensure that the Metropolitan Police secure the evidence, re-examine it 
and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile 
network linked to Parliament and Number 10.’

Prime Minister David Cameron said he would look at the case ‘very carefully and see what the Government can do to help’.

Later Mr Watson revealed further details of the allegations in his 
personal blog saying he had been contacted by a former child protection 
specialist who was concerned that Righton’s suspicious connections were 
not fully investigated.

‘The contact, who has seen the letters, claimed that one paedophile in 
particular was of great concern. He said the paedophile, who worked with
 children, boasted of a key aide to a former PM who could help get hold 
of indecent images of children,’ wrote Mr Watson.

In a statement, Scotland Yard said Operation Fernbridge would be led by the Child Abuse Investigation Command.

It added: ‘The allegations under Operation Fernbridge were initially 
assessed under Operation Fairbank which was information passed to police
 by MP Tom Watson. Operation Fernbridge reached the threshold for a 
criminal investigation.’

Scotland Yard asked anyone with information to contact police on 020 7161 0500.
