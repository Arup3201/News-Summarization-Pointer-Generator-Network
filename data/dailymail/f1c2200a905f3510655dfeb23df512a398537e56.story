If you've been wondering why you never seem to meet anyone you like or how you're supposed to find someone when work rules your life, dating website, MySingleFriend.com could have the answers.

According to the site, singletons can be split into five groups, each with their own dating characteristics - some of which could be holding them back in their quest for love.

'Picky pandas' such as George Clooney are choosy about potential dates and need extra encouragement if they're to step out of their comfort zone, while 'Sharks' like Made in Chelsea's Spencer Matthews think they're just too cool to settle down.

Other groups include 'Man's Best Friend', which includes puppy-like singletons who prefer spending time with friends to dating, 'Worker Bees', who struggle to find time to meet new loves, and 'Night Owls' whose partying habits get in the way of their relationships.

According to psychologist David Holmes who analysed the personality types, identifying - and tackling - these characteristics in yourself can help you find love in the long term.

'Although most people have a complex collection of personality traits, there are often strong features that could provide signposts as to the direction their dating personalities are taking,' he explained.

'Everyone will have a friend or someone they know – maybe even themselves – that they feel fits one of the profiles.'

He added: 'Looking for examples we all know, Harry Styles leads a hectic working lifestyle – the classic worker bee – and needs to find someone that can both understand and slot into that crazy schedule.'

Man's Best Friend: Russell Brand

Night Owl: Cara Delevingne

Shark: Spencer Matthews

'MySingleFriend is all about having fun dating – so we wanted to take an alternative look at the trends between the profiles of singletons on the site, to help daters understand it’s not so much of a jungle out there,' said Sarah Beeny, TV personality and founder of MySingleFriend.com.

'We found that we could easily pull out the common "usual suspects" of the dating world through the behaviours described in profiles on our site.

'Because friends write the singletons profile, there’s no holding back on good and bad traits. The brilliant, honest and often hilarious profiles on MySingleFriend clearly show that there are behaviours common to all our single friends.' 

THE WORKER BEE

Most commonly found buzzing around big cities, a busy working life is often found to be a drawback in dating.

'Harry Styles may find himself being a busy bee as being a bit young and successful to find the time to strike a good love-life to work balance,' explains Holmes.

THE PICKY PANDA

A perfectionist who needs encouragement to step out of their comfort zone. Once they do, they might realise Mr or Mrs Perfect is out there after all. 'Picky pandas tend to enjoy time on their own and are very careful when choosing a date,' says Holmes.

'George Clooney gives this impression and with many of those who become comfortable with themselves first, have a lot to offer to those who are patient and close enough to the picky panda’s criteria.'

MAN'S BEST FRIEND

An adorable, excitable puppish personality who loves attention, these singletons have lots of friends and are very loyal to their group, but often struggle to leave the pack and make time for that one special person.

'Russell Brand is your typical man’s best friend,' says Homes. 'Very popular, fun and loving attention but unable to settle with one person. However, like most dog-types, they can become very faithful once they find their place in the pack.'

THE NIGHT OWL

Common amongst students and twenty-somethings, these would-be daters love to party but burning the candle at both ends leaves them with no time for dating.

Looking for other singletons that come to life in the evenings is recommended here, but also dating at lunchtimes or grabbing a pre-party drink in the afternoon.

'Cara Delevigne loves to party so is best suited to another night owl, who can keep up with her,' says Holmes.

'However be prepared for finding a relationship that may make the day more interesting and ease those nocturnal excesses.'

THE SHARK

More common among men, some singles are judged to be a bit too cool to settle down by their friends and often struggle to find someone they are happy with.

Rather than give up on dating, it is important these people use online dating to flirt and play the numbers game online, so that when the dates happen, they matter.

'Spencer Matthews is our shark,' says Holmes. 'He acts like a player but will hopefully meet his match in charm who will capture his heart.'
