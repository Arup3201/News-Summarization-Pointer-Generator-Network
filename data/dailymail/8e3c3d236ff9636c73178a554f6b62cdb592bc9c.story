He's a father-of-four with plenty of experience as well as a friend of Prince William's, and now David Beckham stepped in with some advice for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as they await the birth of their second child.

But far from top tips on how to juggle changing two sets of nappies, Beckham's advice was simple ant to the point - get more sleep before the baby arrives.

'Get some sleep because jumping from one child to two is a big step,' said Beckham during an appearance on ITV's Lorraine, who then confessed that going from two to three was an even bigger leap.

Daddy cool: Beckham, who is a father of four, offered the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge some advice

Friends: Beckham has known Prince William for several years and is in the running to be godfather

The Duchess, who is currently suffering from acute morning sickness, is thought to want three children by the age of 35.

Beckham's words of support came as Kensington Palace announced that the Duchess will not be attending tonight's Invictus Games opening ceremony and that her trip to Malta next week is 'under review'.

Kate, who suffered from the same extreme morning sickness during her last pregnancy, is expected to give birth in the Spring.

Beckham, who has known the Duke of Cambridge for a number of years and was a guest at the Royal Wedding in 2011, is also in the running to be a godparent for the couple's second child.

According to bookmakers William Hill, Beckham boasts odds of 16 to one to become a godparent - as does his wife Victoria.

Other favourites include Prince Harry, Pippa Middleton, Zara Phillips and Mike Tindall. Long shots include David Cameron and Boris Johnson at 66/1.

'It
 surely has to be a case of second time lucky for Harry and Pippa,' commented spokesman Joe Crilly, 'but 
William has a real bromance with Becks who could well be asked to 
undertake god-parenting duties this time around.'

Godfather or not, Beckham also revealed that he was left delighted by the royal baby news and said that the couple are 'great parents'.

'I’m so happy for them both because they’re such great parents and obviously to be great parents and to have the roles that they have, as important as they have, is really incredible,' he said.

'I’m just happy that they’re going to have another little one running around the house.'

Second child: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge announced that a second baby was on the way on Monday

Missing out: The Duchess will miss the Invictus Games, a passion project of brother-in-law Prince Harry

Thanks to her pregnancy, the Duchess will also miss a Drumhead service at Lee Valley Athletics Centre with the Duke and Prince Harry tomorrow, to remember all those who have died or been injured in conflict.

Currently being treated by doctors at Kensington Palace, she is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, which affects 3.5 per 1,000 pregnancies, causes severe vomiting and can lead to dehydration, weight loss and a build-up of toxins in the blood or urine, called ketosis.

It is thought her illness began sometime last week and when William visited Oxford University on Monday without his wife to open the institution’s new China Centre, he said the Duchess had experienced a 'tricky few days'.

The condition has also thrown her first solo overseas tour into doubt, with the Duchess due to be in Malta on the 20th and 21st September to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence.
