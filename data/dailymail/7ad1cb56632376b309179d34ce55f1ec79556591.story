The BBC has apologised after John Inverdale made an x-rated comment during BBC Radio 5 Live's coverage of the Cheltenham Festival.

While interviewing former jockey John Francome and young jockey Lizzy Kellie, the presenter referred to 'rose-c*****' glasses live on air.

Speaking to Kelly, Inverdale had said: 'This is looking at it through rose-c*****... rose-tinted glasses from the past... (I) apologise there for a slip of the tongue, but Lizzie your love of the sport just shines through'

After the incident, a BBC spokesperson said: 'It was a slip of the tongue and John apologised immediately afterwards.' 

It is not the first time Inverdale, who has over 30 years' broadcasting experience, has been forced to apologise for making inappropriate comments.

A BBC spokesperson said: 'It was a slip of the tongue and John apologised immediately afterwards.'

Inverdale previously said  Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' live on air at Wimbledon

In 2013 he sparked outrage when he said tennis player Marion Bartoli was 'never going to be a looker' live on air before her appearance in the Wimbledon women's singles final.

Inverdale later apologised to Bartoli, while also claiming his comments were in part attributable to a bout of hayfever which had left him feeling under the weather.
