David Cameron has been accused of sending mixed messages after launching a new publicly-funded international marketing campaign claiming  the UK is 'GREAT' - despite regularly saying that Britain's society and economy is broken.

The Prime Minister wants to dispel negativity linked to the country's ongoing economic problems and move away from the anarchic images that were beamed around the globe during last month’s English riots.

More than £500,000 has been spent on the new GREAT campaign and a series of posters will be used across the world centred around the 2012 London Olympics to promote Britain the brand.

Its aim is to attract an extra billion pounds of inward investment and trade over the next year, giving a lift to an economy that has barely grown during the last 12 months.   

GREAT campaign: The Government has spent £510,000 developing the GREAT campaign, which will flag up Britain as a place to visit and do business

Mr Cameron is in New York where he is to address the United Nations General Assembly.

He said last night: 'We want to extend an invitation to the world to take a fresh look at everything we have to offer.

'Britain today is simply a great place to visit, study and work. A great place to invest and do business.'

But only last month, as law and order broke down in cities across England he said: 'In my very first act as leader, I signalled my personal priority: to mend our broken society – that passion is stronger today than ever.

'Social problems that have been festering for decades have exploded in our face.

'The broken society is back at the top of my political agenda.'

Critics have said that the Prime Minister should not ignore the riots, and that the campaign may not be suitable could be deemed as 'bragging' by other countries.

Mark Leonard, the director for the European Council on Foreign Relations, credited with launching the notion of 'Cool Britannia' told the Daily Telegraph: 'My worry about this campaign is that it comes when David Cameron is speaking about broken society, broken economy, and all of the domestic debates are about how nothing works here,' said Mr Leonard.

'It is slightly ludicrous to go to New York and talk about how Britain is great, because that's not the message they've been getting from British media or British politicians.'

GREAT idea: The Government marketing campaign aims to dispel the 
negative images of Britain beamed around the globe during last month's 
riots

Dave Trott, the creative Director of CST Advertising, which produced the 'Enjoy England' campaign in 2009, 'I don't think anyone pays any attention anyway.

'London should be marketed as "the most exciting city in the world right now because it is out of control".

The Government should use the riots as a 'selling point', he told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme: 'Of course. That's what we've got. Don't deny it. Don't pretend we're Switzerland or Singapore. No amount of pretending we're not that will change that.'

Meanwhile Patrick Barwise, emeritus professor of management and marketing at the London Business School told The Times: 'I would certainly be cautious before putting money into a campaign like this because it could be interpreted as bragging.

'The intended effect is for people to think "British people are the most talented in the world. That's wonderful, I'll come." But the alternative is they will think: "Says who? I'm from the United States and I think we're better."

Ministers claim this is not a rebranding exercise, but in fact a chance to put the record straight.

GREAT business plan: Its aim is to attract an extra billion pounds of inward investment and trade over the next year, giving a lift to an economy that has barely grown during the past year

‘It is not about rebranding Britain, we 
have one of the strongest brands in the world,’ Jeremy Hunt, Secretary 
of State for Culture, Media and Sport, told reporters yesterday.    

‘It is about using that brand to create more exports, more inward investment, more trade, more foreign tourists and also to make sure that we can put the record straight after some of the terrible events that happened this summer, which created a negative image,’ he added.   

‘It’s based on something that isn’t new - the idea of putting great back into Britain is something that has been around for a very long time, but we think this is the moment to use it next year.’   

But an economist suggested a billion pounds was a tiny amount in terms of the overall economy.   

‘When GDP is in the trillions, a billion is not a great deal,’ said Scott Corfe, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.   

In 2009, foreign companies invested £46 billion in the UK, a decrease of £3.2 billion from the previous year and the smallest flow of inward direct investment since 2004, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed.   

The government said the bulk of the billion pounds is expected to come from exports.   

The billion pounds will go some way to delivering a return on the £9.3 billion it will cost to stage the Games.   

The government, backed by the Foreign Office and UK Trade and Investment, will host a global investment conference in London on the eve of the Olympics and set up a British business embassy to showcase the country’s innovations, creativity and entrepreneurship.   

GREAT entertainment: The campaign aims to show off what's great about Britain - from music to shopping - and Downing Street has unveiled a series of postcards that promote these, which will be handed out at business events

Politicians also hope the Olympics and Queen Elizabeth’s Diamond Jubilee next year, to mark 60 years of her reign, will boost tourism, attracting an additional four million visitors, aided by a further billion pounds of free publicity.   

The campaign comes at a time when a cash-strapped Conservative-led coalition government looks to the private sector to boost growth, as it embarks on an austerity package to eliminate a record budget deficit.   

The country also has to overcome the damage to its image caused by this summer’s riots in which cars and buildings were burnt and shops looted in London and other English cities.   

GREAT ambition: The campaign comes at a time when a cash-strapped Conservative-led coalition government looks to the private sector to boost growth
