Franz Beckenbauer hailed Louis van Gaal as one of the world’s best coaches and the ‘perfect’ fit for Manchester United because of his experience, ambition and personality.

German icon Beckenbauer watched from close quarters as Van Gaal won the double with  Bayern Munich in 2010, only  missing out on the Champions League trophy in the final against Jose Mourinho’s Inter Milan.

‘He would be perfect for Man United because he is an internationally experienced coach and he understands English football,’ said the Bayern legend, who served the club as captain, manager and president.

‘I don’t know if it’s a rumour or if they’re really trying to sign him but if they agree with Louis I think it would be a good part of the future. He won a lot of titles so he is experienced and he is ambitious. He has the personality. He has everything.’

As for Van Gaal’s reputation for arrogance, which played a part in his exit from Bayern in 2011, Beckenbauer admitted: ‘If you ask him a stupid question then it can be that his answer is a bit arrogant, but if you treat him with respect, then respect comes back to you.

‘I like him. He was also very successful with Bayern Munich. In the end there was a little discussion about the way he was handling his job so that’s why they went separate ways — but for me he’s one of the best coaches in the world.’

Beckenbauer was speaking to Sportsmail as an ambassador of Gazprom’s ‘Football for Friendship’ initiative, which brings children from different European countries together and takes some to Lisbon to attend next month’s Champions League final.

Having beaten United in the quarter-final, Bayern are attempting to become the first team to defend the trophy in the modern era, although they are a goal down to Real Madrid going into the  second leg of the semi-final in Munich tonight.

‘It was not a perfect result, but Bayern Munich can be very happy it was only a 1-0 defeat when it could have been two or three,’ said Beckenbauer, who is not the greatest fan of Pep Guardiola’s possession-based brand of football.

‘He is a master for keeping the ball and there’s always been a philosophy that if you are in possession, the opposition are not able to score goals, but it is not the most attractive part of the game.

‘To score from 30 metres is spectacular, more attractive than to keep possession but it’s the philosophy of Guardiola and it has been successful with Barcelona and Bayern Munich.’

Bayern’s team is largely based around those who won the European title last year under Jupp Heynckes, who was ousted to make way for Guardiola. They are aiming for a third successive Champions League final.

‘I like to watch the wingers, Franck Ribery and Arjen  Robben,’ said Beckenbauer. ‘Manuel Neuer is probably the best goalkeeper in the world and Bastian Schweinsteiger is wonderful for team interest.

‘Jupp Heynckes was really popular and he still is. He won the  treble, the most famous titles in football, but he is 69 years old and so he is not the future. The future is Guardiola and if you have a chance to sign him which Bayern Munich did, I think it was the best move that can ever happen.’

Even so, Bayern cannot expect to dominate the competition as they did in the 1970s, when Beckenbauer’s team won a hat-trick of European titles from 1974-76.

‘You can see how difficult it is to play in this competition because no team have won it twice in a row,’ he said. ‘New teams are getting stronger. It is a different game, different lifestyle and different materials. Everything is much more professional than it was 40 years ago.’

If Bayern make it past Real Madrid tonight, they could face Chelsea in the final. Beckenbauer once claimed Jose Mourinho was ‘rude and with no education’ but he admires him as a coach.

‘Jose is Jose, I wouldn’t say the best but if you have Guardiola and if you have Jose Mourinho it can’t be better,’ he said. ‘I like personalities. I like these kinds of people and he is one of the most successful coaches in the whole world.

‘Yes, he can win it again, why not? Chelsea have the chance to beat Atletico at home, then they are in the final and in one game  anything can happen.’
