House of Horrors: The Elm Guest House in Barnes, London, the alleged base for an establishment paedophile ring

A victim of an alleged establishment paedophile ring told yesterday how  he was ordered to wear a fairy costume before being abused.

The orphan was 13 when he and his 12-year-old brother were sent by staff at their  children’s home to the Elm Guest House for ‘a treat’, it  is claimed.

He said boys were plied  with alcohol 
before being told  to pose for pictures wearing  girls’ clothing. The 
men at the guest house – said to include MPs and pop stars – would then 
abuse the children after pretending to play hide-and-seek, the victim 
said.

More than a decade after leaving care, the victim’s brother, Peter, killed himself six days after his 28th birthday.

A line in his suicide note which appeared to refer to his ordeal read: ‘I will get those b*******.’

The
 former guest house in Barnes, south-west London, is now the centre of a
 police investigation into an alleged child sex abuse ring in the late 
1970s and early 1980s. Police are examining claims that children from 
the Grafton Close Children’s Home were taken to the guest house to have 
sex with men.

During a 
police raid on a property in central London last month detectives seized
 a list of names of high profile alleged visitors to the guest house.

As
 reported in Saturday’s Daily Mail, the list includes a number of senior
 MPs, two pop stars, a high-ranking policeman, a leading tycoon, an 
official from the Royal household and traitorous Soviet spy Anthony 
Blunt.

Cyril Smith, the late Liberal MP, has already been named as a regular at the guest house.

Yesterday
 the victim, known only as Dave, said: ‘The people responsible have 
blood on their hands. I shouldn’t think my brother is the only one to 
have taken his life because of this. I’m speaking out now because I want
 justice done for me and for my brother. What went on was absolutely 
disgusting.

‘When we told 
the staff at the care home what was happening at Elm they used to say: 
“They are friends, they are good people”. No one was listening to us. 
It’s taken 30 years for anyone to listen.’

Dave,
 who now has young children of his own, told how he and his younger 
brother were taken into care after their widowed mother killed herself 
following years of depression. They were sent to Grafton Close 
Children’s Home in Hanworth, west London, in 1978.

Dave
 was 13 when minibus outings to the Elm Guest House began. ‘We were told
 we were going to the “good house” for a party,’ he told a newspaper.

‘It wouldn’t be more than a handful of us at a time. When we got there it was a huge house.’

He said the children would be escorted through reception without signing the guest book and taken to a back room where parties were held. ‘There would be easy-listening music playing, sort of mellow stuff, and loads to drink,’ Dave said. ‘Sometimes there would be two adults there, other times more. They laid on tables with beer and cider. We would have races to see who could drink it first.

‘They used to make us dress up, make us put on outfits like fairy costumes meant for girls, then play games of hide-and-seek with the adults looking for the kids.’

When the children were ‘found’, they were forced to take part in appalling sex abuse.

Dave added: ‘There would be flash bulbs going off when someone was taking pictures.

‘I can remember all the adults had posh accents. They used to say things like “He’s cute, he’s nice”. They would pick out the pretty boys, especially the ones who looked young for their age.’

Last week Dave was visited by two officers from Scotland Yard’s Operation Fernbridge, which is investigating the case.

Dave’s testimony echoes that of former child protection worker Chris Fay, who says he was shown photos of children dressed up at ‘Kings and Queens parties’ at the guest house. One photograph is said to show a former Tory Cabinet minister in a sauna with a naked 14-year-old boy.
