But Klinsmann said he was disappointed by the extra-time defeat in Brazil and vowed to do better in Russia in 2018.

'It was possible to get into the quarter-final, it was even possible to get into the semi-final in Brazil. 

'This is our goal going towards Russia. To say clearly, listen, we have four years to prepare this cycle. Our goal is going to a semifinal in a World Cup. And that means a lot of work, a lot of competition, a lot of grind.'
