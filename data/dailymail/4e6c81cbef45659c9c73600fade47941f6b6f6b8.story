Broadcasting legend Murray Walker has revealed how he almost punched Formula 1 star James Hunt on air while they were commentating on a race together.

Walker, below, who worked with the 1976 Grand Prix world champion for 13 years, tells today’s Desert Island Discs he was left ‘incandescent with rage’ when Hunt cut him off in mid-flow.

Murray, 90, said: ‘To ensure only one person at a time was talking we had one microphone, which involved the extreme physical sacrifice, as far as I was concerned, of giving up the microphone to James Hunt occasionally.

‘There was one occasion at Silverstone when I was standing up and James was sitting down, and I was giving it plenty and James thought the old boy had been  talking long enough.

'He gave the microphone wire a terrific tug and it flew out of my hands and into his.

‘I actually had my fist back to give him a fourpenny one because I was absolutely incandescent with rage.

'I looked across and Mark Wilson the producer was wagging his fingers  at me saying, “No Murray! Don’t!”

‘So I didn’t, and what turned out to be a good friendship was retained.’

The pair continued to work together until Hunt’s death at the age of 45 from a heart attack in 1993. Desert Island Discs is on Radio 4 at 11.15am.
