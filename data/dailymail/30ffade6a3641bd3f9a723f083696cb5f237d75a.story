Britain’s next generation military drone has ‘surpassed all expectations’ in its first test flight.

Taranis, which is named after the Celtic god of thunder, is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design.

It took to the air for the first time in August, but footage of the flight has only just been released.

Taranis is the UK's next generation military drone, named after the Celtic god of thunder.

It is designed to fly faster than the speed of sound and evade enemy radar with its single-wing stealth design.

The autonomous vehicle made its first test flight in August, when it took off, rotated, climbed and landed at various speeds and altitudes.

BAE Systems which made the aircraft, described it as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’.

Taranis cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry.

The drone is around the same size as a Hawk fighter jet and is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies.

The pilotless combat aircraft made ‘a 
perfect take-off, rotation, “climb out” and landing on its first 
flight,' according to BAE systems, which made the drone.

The British defence firm described its largest drone as ‘the most advanced aircraft ever built by British engineers’ and test pilot Bob Fraser tried it out for a 15 minute flight at ‘an undisclosed test range’ in August.

The advanced weapon, which could spearhead the fight against terror in Africa, cost £185million to develop and was funded jointly by the UK MOD and UK industry.

It made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, the company said.

During tests, Taranis also used latest stealth communications systems to stay in touch with its commander without revealing its position

The drone is around the same size as a Hawk fighter jet and while it was first unveiled in July 2010, it has not been seem flying before now, The Huffington Post reported.

Taranis is the result of one-and-a-half million hours of work by UK engineers from over 250 companies, but only a select group have a lot of access to the secret aircraft.

‘Taranis is providing vital insights that will help shape future capabilities for our Armed Forces in coming decades.

'Its advanced technology is testament to the UK's world leading engineering skills that keep Britain at the cutting edge of defence,’ Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Equipment, Support and Technology said.

Military chiefs believe Taranis’ ground-breaking technology will allow a powerful new generation of drones equipped with deadly payloads to fly from British bases and attack targets worldwide. 

The new drone has made a number of flights last year at a variety of altitudes and speeds for periods of up to one hour, BAE Systems said

But the new developments in pilotless aircraft are controversial as they allow the possibility of autonomous computers targeting and killing enemy combatants outside human control.

Experts have previously warned that the new technology would potentially lead to a nightmarish scenario of out-of-control robots waging war on humans and have even called for a global ban on autonomous technology.

Britain’s armed drones are currently piloted remotely by aircrews on the ground, but Taranis will follow a set flightpath using on-board computers to perform manoeuvres, avoid threats and identify targets.

Only when it needs to attack a target will it seek authorisation from a human controller.

‘This is a very dangerous move. Once it has been developed, who knows what new governments who inherit the technology will do with it,’ Professor Noel Sharkey, a robotics engineer specialising in autonomous military systems at Sheffield University, said last January.

Last year David Cameron warned that the fight against terrorism in North Africa could last decades, meaning futuristic drones could dominate counter-terrorism strategy in the region.

British Forces operate armed drones in Afghanistan, where they target Taliban insurgents and the UK Government has committed itself to a new generation of pilotless aircraft which can fly distances of more than 2,000 miles.
