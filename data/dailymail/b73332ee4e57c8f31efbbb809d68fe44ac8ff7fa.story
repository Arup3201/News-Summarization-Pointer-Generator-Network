An Arizona woman is getting her first taste of freedom in more than two decades after an appeals court overturned her murder conviction.

A photo was published on crimefilenews.com of Debra Milke who is reportedly staying in a Phoenix home provided by supporters.

She spent more than 20 years on death row for the death of her 4-year-old son.

The photo shows Milke wearing a colorful short-sleeved top and smelling a rose.

Debra Milke walked out of the Maricopa County Sheriff's jail on Friday after supporters posted her $250,000 bond.

The
9th Circuit Court of Appeals overturned her conviction in March, ruling
that prosecutors should have disclosed information that cast doubt on 
the credibility of a now-retired detective who said Milke confessed to 
being involved in the killing of her 4-year-old son, Christopher.

The 49-year-old Milke has not been exonerated, but a judge allowed her to could go free while she prepares for a new trial in a case that made her one of Arizona's most reviled inmates.

Milke was convicted in the death of her son who authorities believe was killed for a $5,000 insurance payout. Police said Milke dressed the boy in his favorite outfit in December 1989, telling him he was going to see Santa Claus at a mall before handing him over to two men who took the child into the desert and shot him. She had been imprisoned since 1990.

Doubt: The 9th Circuit agreed that there is some doubt about damning testimony given by a detective who single-handedly put Milke on death row

Prosecutors declined to comment on Milke's possible release and have not appealed the bond order.

Milke,
whose mother was a German who married a U.S. Air Force military 
policeman in Berlin in the early 1960s, has drawn strong support from 
citizens of that nation and Switzerland, neither of which has the death 
penalty.

Max Krucker, 
former president of the Swiss community where Milke's mother now lives, 
said Renate Janka was 'ecstatic'Â  that her 
daughter had been released.

'She
said, `Now I can finally hold my daughter in my arms again,'' he told 
The Associated Press in a telephone interview from her home.

For as long as Milke has been incarcerated, she and her mother have only met in situations where they were separated by glass.

'They were never able to touch,' Krucker said.

A
dozen years ago, Krucker was among the organizers of an effort in the 
Swiss town of Emmetten to support Milke, including by establishing a 
bank account that collected donations to aid in her defense. The account
eventually netted about 200,000 Swiss francs, or about $213,000 today. 
It's now nearly drained, he said.

Doubts about Milke's guilt and deep suspicion about the reliability of the detective's testimony helped motivate Swiss supporters to donate, as did opposition to the death penalty. Many also had concerns that Milke didn't have access to the best defense because she had too little money, he said.

Now supporters 
are excited about the prospect of her release, Krucker said, but also 
worried how she will manage to pay the bond.

Janka, who is suffering from cancer, was already forced to sell her home to help cover her daughter's legal bills, he said.

Supporters also run a website that requests donations through both German and Swiss accounts.

Milke's
ex-husband, whose name is Arizona Milke, believes his former wife is 
guilty and that supporters are fooled by the postings on the website.

'It's fed by propagandized lies,' he said on Friday. 'They write whatever they want and put it up there like it's true.'

Her
chance at freedom comes six months after a federal appeals court 
overturned Milke's conviction, ruling that the prosecution should have 
disclosed information about the truthfulness of the now-retired 
detective who testified that Milke confessed.

Milke
was a 25-year-old insurance company clerk when her son was killed. She 
has maintained her innocence, saying she had nothing to do with the 
slaying.

The two men 
convicted in the case both remain on death row. Neither Roger Scott nor 
former Milke roommate James Styers testified at Milke's trial. Scott 
confessed during a police interrogation and led detectives to the boy's 
body.

Maricopa County 
prosecutors are still seeking the death penalty against Milke at her 
retrial, tentatively set for Sept. 30, and her alleged confession is at 
the heart of the case against her.

Police
detective Armando Saldate Jr. testified that she confessed to him in a 
closed interrogation room. But the confession was not recorded.

At trial, Milke denied that she had confessed, but the jury believed the detective.

Doubts
about Saldate's honesty arose during Milke's appeals. The 9th Circuit 
concluded in March that prosecutors' failure to turn over evidence 
related to Saldate's credibility deprived Milke's attorneys of the 
chance to question his truthfulness before jurors.

'No
civilized system of justice should have to depend on such flimsy 
evidence, quite possibly tainted by dishonesty or overzealousness, to 
decide whether to take someone's life or liberty,' Chief Judge Alex 
Kozinski wrote for the court.

The
court noted four cases in which judges threw out confessions or 
indictments because Saldate lied under oath and four instances in which 
cases were tossed out or confessions excluded because Saldate violated 
the suspect's constitutional rights.

He
was also suspended for accepting sexual favors from a female motorist 
he stopped and then lying about the encounter, the court said.

Deputy
County Attorney Vince Imbordino argued last week during a bond hearing 
that the purported confession is still admissible, but Judge Rosa Mroz 
of Maricopa County Superior Court said the undisclosed material 
concerning Saldate 'casts serious doubt' on its validity.

Mroz,
who also set Milke's bond, scheduled a Sept. 23 hearing on the 
defense's request to prohibit the prosecution from using the confession 
during the retrial.
