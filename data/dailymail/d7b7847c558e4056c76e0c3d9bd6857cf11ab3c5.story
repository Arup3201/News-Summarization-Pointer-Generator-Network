The mystery of the dead shark that improbably appeared in a New York subway carriage has finally been solved.

It appears that the animal was washed up on the beach at Coney Island after pictures emerged of an excited gang of children posing with it.

A 'guy' then took off with the shark, according to the Gothamist, who appear to have photographic evidence of the subway shark after a parent submitted beach snaps.

Fishy: Passenger Brandon Sanchez captured a small dead shark that somehow ended up on the floor of a train running on the 'N' line on Wednesday

A man called Domenick emailed the site to say that he believes his and his neighbor's children first came across the shark during a day at the Coney Island beach.

He told the Gothamist that the shark washed up on the beach and the lifeguard allowed the children to take pictures with it.

The father added that his daughter was keen to pick up the creature - but the boys in the group backed off.

The last that the children seen of the shark, was a 'guy' heading off with him. Whether the shark was then taken directly to the subway is unknown. 

The mystery began on Wednesday after the 
creature was spotted by passenger Brandon Sanchez, 20, who boarded an 
uptown ‘N’ train on Canal Street in Manhattan. The 'N' train runs from 
Coney Island.

The
 Brooklyn resident told the New York Post that he was struck by a foul 
odor, the source of which turned out to be a dead shark.

‘It was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen on the subway in New York!’ he said.

Sanchez snapped a picture of the animal and posted it on Instagram with the tagline: ‘Gotta love NYC... casual dead shark on the subway...#NYC’

At 12.30am, the conductor on the train was alerted and after reporting the incident to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, quickly closed off car No. 8994.

The gruesome and strange discovery coincides with Discovery Channel’s popular series Shark Week - leaving some to wonder if the critter on the train was nothing more than a publicity stunt.

But an MTA spokesperson confirmed that the shark was indeed real.

According to a statement from the agency, when the train reached its final destination, Ditmars Boulevard in Queens, a supervisor unceremoniously tossed the dead fish in a garbage bag and dumped it in the trash. The car was then put back into service.
