The popularity of British music is declining internationally as fans around the world choose to listen to music produced in their own country instead.

Britain's share of the global pop charts has steadily dropped since the so-called British Invasion of the 1960s when The Beatles and the Rolling Stones ruled the world.

Research shows that while Britain is still punching above its weight, music fans are increasingly choosing to listen to songs produced by domestic artists.

Flying the flag: Dido and Robbie Williams were the only Brits to feature on a list of international 'superstars'

Economists Joel Waldfogel, a professor at
Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, and his 
co-author Fernando Ferreira took data from the charts of 22 countries between 2001 and 2007 - which represented 98 per cent of the global music market.

The project, which looked at the work of 23,000 artists, found that during the 1960s 30 per cent of music in the charts was made by a Brit.

Since then it has steadily declined after a brief jump in the mid-80s when bands like Duran Duran and Wham! were the most popular groups in the world.

The popularity of American music has continued to grow but the emergence of the internet has also helped artists from smaller countries.

According to the economists, 31 artists appeared in at least 18 country's charts simultaneously for at least a year between 2001 and 2007. 

Twenty-three, such as Backstreet Boys, Christina Aguilera, Eminem, and Jennifer Lopez, were from the U.S.

Only 31 artists across the world featured simultaneously in 18 countries's pop chats for at least one year:

Just two Brits - Dido and Robbie Williams - made it onto the elite list.

American music currently makes up 60 per cent of the charts, up from about 40 per cent in the mid-1980s.

Despite U.S. dominance in the list of 'superstars', Waldfogel and Ferreira said the amount of music bought by indigenous stars is also on the rise.

In the 1980s about half of the music bought was by domestic artists but by 2007 that had increased to 70 per cent.

They credited the growth of the internet and MTV as helping to 'democratise' music and help increase the popularity of home-grown artists.

The authors said: 'Some smaller countries actually benefit substantially in this global market, as they are able to achieve market shares that are sometimes two or three times larger than the relative sizes of their economies.

'Moreover, new technologies that lower trade costs do not appear to have a destructive effect on local production and consumption of music.'

It is not all bad news for the British music industry either.

The UK is one of just six countries - alongside Sweden, New Zealand, the U.S., Finland and Canada - whose music industry share is greater than their relative GDP share.

The report, published in the Economic Journal, found: 'Despite widespread fears about American dominance, music trade is roughly proportional to countries' GDPs'

British music sales were 52 per cent higher than its relative world GDP share.

Sweden - the home of the likes of Roxette and the Cardigans - had sales 59 per cent above its GDP, compared to America's 33 per cent.

Waldfogel said far from killing diversity in the music industry,  MTV and the growth of the internet has actually had a positive effect. 

He said: 'Overall, our findings suggest that concern about cultural domination by large economies – particularly the US – may be misplaced for music.'

Although, the study does not include digital sales in the past six years, the trend suggests the internet will continue to help artists, such as South Korea's Psy, reach a global audience.
