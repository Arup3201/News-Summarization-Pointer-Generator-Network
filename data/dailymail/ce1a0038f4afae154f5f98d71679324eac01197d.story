Katy Holmes, 33, was caught having sex with a stranger on the bonnet of a car in a quiet residential street in Blackpool

Two people caught having sex on a car bonnet in broad daylight had only met each other minutes before their steamy clinch, a court has heard.

Katy Holmes, 33, was caught in the act with a stranger on the bonnet of a red Peugeot in a quiet cul-de-sac in Blackpool, Lancashire.

Single Holmes escaped jail for her involvement in the 
lewd offence which occurred at around 9.45am after she met the stranger while buying a bottle
 of water from a nearby shop.

Following the incident in December last year, Holmes told police: 'The man started flirting with me. We had met at 
the newsagents. I was on the way home.

'What happened was consensual - but I accept people who saw what was going on might think it lewd and offensive.'

However, a disgusted mother spotted theÂ seedy rendezvous while with her young child and immediately called the police.

Don Green, prosecuting at Blackpool Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, said: 'A witness saw what was going on through the front window of her home.

'Holmes was smiling and laughing and appeared to be enjoying what was going on.'

When officers arrived in the quiet cul-de-sac in Blackpool where the offence took place, the man fled by scaling a metal fence. An officer caught his ankles but he kicked out and escaped.

Holmes, who cried throughout her court hearing, admitted committing an act outraging public decency by behaving in an indecent manner.

The seedy offence took place on the quiet Hyde Road in Blackpool, Lancashire, at around 9.45am on a December morning last year. Holmes told police she had met the man just minutes before

Steven Townley, defending, said: 'This is an unusual offence which is a difficult case to sentence.

'She has no convictions for any similar offences.

'It is just something which happened on the spur of the moment - something she regrets.'

Holmes was sentenced to an eight week prison term suspended for 12 months. She was also given 12 months supervision.

Chairman of the bench Stephen Musgrave said: 'This offence took place in public, in the day time and there were children present.

'These are aggravating circumstances and almost put you straight behind bars.'
