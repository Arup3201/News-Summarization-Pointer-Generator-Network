Dale Daniel Challoner, 31, who was suffering from depression, was found dead in a community garden after he stormed out of his home in Powys, Wales, following the fight.

An inquest into his death on Friday heard that he had argued with his partner Danielle Plumpton when she commented that the Eastenders star was good looking.

Miss Plumpton told the inquest at  Powys that the argument had continued via text message after he walked out

She pointed out he had previously made similar comments about reality TV star Kim Kardashian, and could get a bit jealous.

She said she had known Mr Challoner for about four years and he had lived with her for one month, after leaving his mother's home after she caught him using gas.Â
