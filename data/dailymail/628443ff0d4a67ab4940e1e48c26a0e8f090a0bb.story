An airline has paid an undisclosed amount to more than 70 injured survivors of plane crash in San Francisco two years ago, court papers have revealed.

The beneficiaries are all survivors of Asiana Flight 214, which slammed into a seawall at the city's airport in March 2013, leaving three dead and nearly 200 injured.

The settlement with 72 passengers who filed personal injury claims also includes Boeing, which made the airplane, and Air Cruisers Co., the New Jersey company that made its evacuation slides.

Liabilities: The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214 after it crashed at the San Francisco International Airport in San Francisco. More than 70 passengers have reached a settlement in their lawsuits against the airline

Disaster: An aerial view of the destroyed aircraft, which was consumed by fire after crash landing

The court filing published yesterday did not include the settlement's financial terms, details which plaintiffs' attorney Frank Pitre said are confidential.

'This is the first positive step for these passengers to be able to get closure on a tragic, catastrophic crash and hopefully try to get their lives back together,' Mr Pitre said.

'We're pleased we've been able to get this first phase resolved.'

Dozens more cases involving other passengers are still pending in federal court in Northern California.

Boeing spokesman Miles Kotay said the aerospace firm does not comment on pending litigation. Calls to attorneys for Asiana and Air Cruisers Co. were not immediately returned, the Associated Press reported.

On July 6 2013 three Chinese teenagers were killed and nearly 200 others hurt when the Boeing 777 from South Korea slammed into a seawall at the end of a runway during final approach to to San Francisco International Airport.

The impact ripped off the back of the plane, tossed out three flight attendants and their seats, and scattered pieces of the jet across the runway as it spun and skidded to a stop.

U.S. safety investigators blamed the pilots, saying they bungled the landing approach by inadvertently deactivating the plane's key control for airspeed, among other errors.

But the National Transportation Safety Board also said the complexity of the Boeing 777's auto-throttle and auto flight director — two of the plane's key systems for controlling flight — contributed to the accident.

The NTSB also faulted materials provided to airlines by Chicago-based Boeing, saying they fail to make clear the conditions in which the auto-throttle doesn't automatically maintain speed.

Investigators said captain Lee Kang-Kuk, a seasoned Airbus A320 pilot transitioning to the bigger Boeing 777, cut the autopilot on final approach into San Francisco, where the instrument landing system was out of service.

Doing so put the auto-throttle on hold, meaning it would no longer automatically control airspeed, explained investigator-in-chief Bill English.

When the jet dipped below the correct glide path, Captain Lee reacted by pulling the nose up - but the auto-throttle, still on hold, failed to deliver an expected burst of engine power that would have enabled the airliner to make the runway.

Mr Pitre said the passengers who settled had injuries that were less serious and have stabilized.

At least 14 of the people with whom settlements were reached are minors, requiring the court to approve the agreements, according to Tuesday's filing.
