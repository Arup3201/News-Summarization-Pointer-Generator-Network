This is the place where the Queen Mother exchanged nods with a complete stranger who was sitting in a warm bath. It was where Princess Margaret allegedly took cocaine with the Rolling Stones at a concert, and where a young Cliff Richard had announced he had found Christ at a Billy Graham ‘crusade’. Oh yes, and in 1896 Buffalo Bill Cody put on his Wild West Show there.

But now the bulldozers are growling with impatience. Soon the demolition men will be moving in. With an £8 billion project at stake — now that London Mayor Boris Johnson has given the scheme his blessing — they will not take long to reduce to rubble the art deco façade famous around the world and the vast buildings on 77 valuable acres behind it.

Progress, if that is the right word, comes in many guises. In this instance, Earls Court exhibition centre, for more than a century a palace of excitement and dreams in the heart of London, is coming down to make way for — but you already knew — town houses and flats.

The sad moment when the edifice starts to crumble will unlock a billion nostalgic memories. For generations of young lovers and families, Earls Court has resonated with our most fundamental needs — home-making, romance and entertainment.

What brought the late Queen Mother into contact with a bathing man there was the Daily Mail Ideal Home Exhibition, which was staged at Earls Court over many years. It was the mid-Eighties and she had declared the highly popular exhibition open. Then, as she began a tour of the exhibits, she steered a course through the kitchens towards the bathrooms — and there was this young man demonstrating one of the luxuries of life.

Their brief exchange was not exactly a deep conversation, more an exchange of smiles and nods. The poor chap was in no position to bow. He was said to be ‘almost in a prayer’ of relief when she moved on.

The waiting cameramen resisted the temptation to capture the introduction, but demonstrating wise discretion, they instead photographed a subsequent encounter between the Queen Mother and a female model wearing a swimsuit.

As for Princess Margaret’s visit backstage with the Stones, this emerged in a scurrilous biography of the Queen’s sister in which it was alleged she was invited by Mick Jagger to a Stones concert at Earls Court and partook of the drug with them in their dressing rooms before the concert, watched by 23,000 people, had begun.

‘An amusing drug, don’t you think?’ she was quoted as saying to one of the band’s female assistants.

For Cliff Richard, the exhibition centre holds very different memories. He was 26 and already a big star when he went to Earls Court to see American evangelist Billy Graham. He listened to Graham — now 95 and in poor health — and that night he joined dozens of others in the audience shuffling down to the front of the stage. Suddenly there he was on stage declaring to 27,000 people he had found Christ.

Others have packed into the great auditorium for very different reasons. On July 16, 1939, just six weeks before the outbreak of World War II, Oswald Mosley filled it to overflowing with his blackshirts for a mass rally of the British Union of Fascists.

With the party’s white lightning bolt insignia hanging from the walls, Mosley’s ranting speech raised to a fever of excitement the 50,000 who had squeezed standing into a space built to seat half that number.

‘Mosley, Mosley, Mosley,’ they cried until his name reverberated around the walls and could be heard outside in the streets. That Earls Court gathering was then, and remains now, the biggest indoor political rally ever held in Britain.

When Mosley hired Earl Court, it was only two years old in its present form. Back in 1887, when it was originally opened on what had been waste land by the engineer-businessman John R. Whitley, it was an open-air space surrounded by covered stands, rather as football stadia are today. It was called Earls Court after the Earl of Zetland, who owned the freehold.

One of Whitley’s first major successes was Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, which pulled in 15,000 visitors a day including, on one occasion, the whole of Harrow School, possibly including the young Winston Churchill who had just started there.

The ground was turned into a lake in order to accommodate Captain Paul Boyton’s Water Show, an aquatic stunts display featuring the country’s first ‘water toboggan’.

In 1895 there was the Empire Of India Exhibition supported by four maharajahs, with spectacular displays and a 300ft ferris wheel that could carry 1,600 people at a time, revolving in eight minutes (though on one occasion when it broke down the passengers were suspended for four-and-a-half hours).

In a po-faced editorial, the magazine The Builder described the wheel as ‘a foolish kind of sensational toy . . . carrying coachloads of fools round in a vertical circle’.

Then came World War I and Earls Court became a refugee camp for Belgians whose country had been overrun by the German army. Part of it became a bus depot. But when new owners took it over in 1935, they decided to build a vast, triangular building over the site.

Ironically, at the outbreak of war this huge edifice that Mosley had hired to promote his black propaganda served the war effort brilliantly, and was perfect as a factory making and testing barrage balloons in the heart of London where they were most needed.

The post-war years and the country’s need for glamour and entertainment revealed Earls Court to be the most flexible venue in the country. In 1948 there was the Aquashow, starring Johnny Weissmuller, who had gone from being an Olympic swimming champion to Hollywood’s Tarzan.

Earls Court was the perfect place for Tarzan, for it had been built with a permanent swimming pool covered by a 750-ton concrete floor which slid in and out of sight at the touch of a button.

They packed in to see Cinderella On Ice and other ice-borne shows. During one panto in 1949, one of the skating clowns stopped to plant a kiss on the bald head of a mild-looking chap sitting with his family in the front row.

It was Clement Attlee, Britain’s post-war Labour prime minister.

A strong royal link also began to take root as the Royal Tournament — the world’s largest military tattoo, held by the Armed Forces annually — was established there, along with the Motor Show and the International Boat Show.

For Billy Graham, it was a natural place to hold his mass meetings. And then Earls Court was discovered, as it were, by the pop groups.

Pink Floyd first played there in 1973, and had other full-capacity appearances in 1980, and again in 1981, selling out the entire 85,000 tickets in just four hours.

Thirteen years later, in 1994, they had just started their set when a stand holding 1,200 fans collapsed, injuring 96. Miraculously, no one was killed. The concert was abandoned.

Led Zeppelin filled it for several nights in 1975, charging £1 a ticket: £9 in today’s money, and what fans might pay for a programme these days.

The Rolling Stones, too, played Earls Court to packed houses, sometimes with Mick Jagger’s friend Princess Margaret and friends slipping into their seats just as the lights went down.

David Bowie also filled it. Earls Court was also where Spice Girl Geri Halliwell wore her famous Union flag dress at The Brit awards, and where, just the other week, the Victoria’s Secret fashion show extravaganza attracted huge attention.

And, finally, it was in an almost surreal atmosphere that the Bombay Bicycle Club, an Indie rock band from north London, took to the stage on Saturday. For this, it seems, was the very last gig of any kind at Earls Court.

Pink Floyd’s David Gilmour made a point of being there. He slipped on stage to sing the band’s song Wish You Were Here.

With rock royalty on stage, someone described the farewell to Earls Court as ‘joyous’.

Nostalgic would surely have been a better word to describe the night the music died.
