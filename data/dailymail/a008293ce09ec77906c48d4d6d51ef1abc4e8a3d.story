Men and women have different tastes in art because of biological diversity that was forged in the Stone Age, according to a leading academic.

And the fact early men and women took on the different roles of hunters and gatherers may explain why just one painting in 200 at the National Gallery is by a woman, says Professor Gloria Moss. 

In her new book Why Men Like Straight Lines And Women Like Polka Dots*, Prof Moss argues that these ancient biological differences mean that men have better rotational and spacial vision because they were responsible for spotting and targeting prey. 

Prof Moss said only one painting at the National Gallery, pictured, is by a woman as collections are generally chosen by men and each gender tends to like works by their respective sex due to biological differences

‘Some people will be squirming at the suggestion of hunter and gatherer fine-art skills,’ she says. ‘But the way men and women actually see is radically different, thanks to their roles in the hunter gatherer age. On average, men’s eyes are spaced 5mm further apart than women’s.

‘Men have better stereoscopic vision, better targeting and rotational skills and can see better in 3D. But at the same time, men are more likely to be colour blind than women. Men have three colour pigments, which means they can see millions of colours. But a substantial number of women have four colour pigments, which means they can see a much greater range.’

For this reason, Prof Moss believes men and women prefer paintings created by their own sex, explaining why great art collections – historically run by men – have only a handful of works by women.

Men prefer works that have darker and fewer colours and are more likely to be drawn to works about inanimate objects, she says.

By contrast, women prefer more colourful paintings, likely to be about animate things like people and plants.

Prof Moss said that men like darker paintings with fewer colours about inanimate objects, while women choose artworks featuring people or plants as they are able to see a greater range of colours
