Old Harrovian Neil Heywood was murdered by one of the most powerful women in China after he made a threatening demand for £13million from her playboy son, a court heard yesterday.

Gu Kailai, who was said to be having an affair with the British businessman, lured him to a hotel room where she got him drunk and then laced his drink with cyanide.

Four police officers were today said to have admitted covering up the murder in court. They will be sentenced later.

The alleged motive behind 41-year-old Mr Heywood’s grisly death was revealed at the murder trial of Gu, dubbed the Jackie Kennedy of China. Her lawyer even argued that affable Mr Heywood, a father of two young children, ‘should bear some responsibility’ for his own murder.

In the dock: Gu Kailai, 52, and aide Zhang Xiaojun, 33, are escorted into the Hefei City People's Court to face charges relating to the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood in November

No contest: Gu and Zhang did not raise any objections that on November 13, 2011, they went to Heywood's hotel room and, after getting him drunk, administered a fatal poison

The court heard the Jaguar-driving 
Englishman had fallen into an ‘economic dispute’ with Gu’s party-loving 
son Bo Guagua, 24, whom Mr Heywood had once mentored to secure a place 
at his alma mater, Harrow School.

Mr Bo, known for a love of champagne 
and shisha parties while studying at Oxford University, was allegedly 
told by Mr Heywood: ‘If you do not give me £13million, you will be 
destroyed,’ the judges heard, according to a reliable source who was in 
the courtroom.

These threats, in an email or letter, were said to have been forwarded by Bo to his mother.

International media were banned from 
the highly-politicised trial, which concluded in less than seven hours 
in the Intermediate People’s Court in the eastern Chinese city of Hefei.
The source added that the court heard it was not the first 
assassination plot on Mr Heywood, with Gu having previously conspired to
kill him with a local police chief.

Political scandal: Gu Zailai, left, with her husband - former Chongqing Municipality Communist Party Secretary Bo Xilai. The murder case is one of China's biggest political scandals

Gu Kailai was a humiliated wife who had a ‘wolfish appetite’ for sex, Chinese investigators claimed.

As her trial went ahead, police said she was vulnerable because her husband indulged in affairs and she was at an age when her sex drive increased.

The claim was made to justify Beijing’s official version that Gu had been involved in an affair with Neil Heywood.

It is also claimed that British spies pushed Mr Heywood into having an affair with Gu because they were convinced her husband Bo was a rich source of intelligence.

The suggestions surfaced via ‘political insiders’ in Beijing quoted in a Hong Kong magazine.

Its story begins in the 1990s after Mr Heywood began tutoring Mr Bo’s young son in English, and the boy was put into Papplewick, a prep school in Berkshire.

Gu travelled to England to be near her son, taking a flat in Bournemouth. According to the magazine which quoted a police chief in the case, she was ‘hungry’ for sex.

‘At that time Gu Kailai was about 40 years old, which is an age when women have a wolfish appetite for sex,’ he said, ‘and they soon became lovers.’ 

After Gu returned to China, Mr Heywood married a Chinese woman, Lulu Wang. But the magazine alleges MI6 pushed him to resume the affair. Friends of Mr Heywood have dismissed the claims as nonsense.

There have been reports, denied by Mr 
Heywood’s friends, that he and Gu – the wife of deposed Communist chief 
Bo Xilai – were having an affair. Last night, after the secretive trial 
ended, officials gave brief details of the case.

The court’s deputy director Tang Yigan
announced: ‘Gu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the 
personal safety  of her son Bo and decided to  kill him.’

Gu summoned him to Chongqing, the 
mega-city in southwestern China where her husband was Communist Party 
Secretary, on November 13 last year. They drank tea and wine together in
room 1605 of the ‘Lucky Holiday Hotel’, before  Mr Heywood became drunk
and was sick.

After he had vomited, Gu, 53, helped 
him drink a glass of water – which she had mixed with a lethal draft of 
potassium cyanide. A tiny drop can cause agonising death within minutes.
‘She poured it into Heywood’s mouth, killing him,’ said Mr Tang.

State television showed Gu, wearing a 
dark trouser suit and a white shirt, being led into the courtroom and 
seated in the dock. She appeared to have put on weight since she was 
detained earlier  this year.

Neither Gu nor her co-accused – family
bodyguard Zhang Xiajun, 33, who is alleged to have prepared the poison –
entered pleas but they did not contest the murder charge against them. A
student who was allowed to witness the case said Gu had appeared 
‘calm’, despite the possibility she could be sentenced to death. ‘There 
were no tears. Both looked quite calm, peaceful. Both said they accepted
the court’s authority,’ said the student. Mr Tang said prosecutors 
believed the facts of the ‘brutal’ crime were clear and backed by ‘ample
evidence’, and that ‘Gu Kailai is the main culprit and Zhang is the 
accomplice’.

Information blackout: As police control the situation outside the courthouse, the government has rigorously censored all reporting of the case within the country

Implicated: The official allegation against Gu suggests Heywood might have been making threats against her son Bo Guagua, 24

During the hearing, Gu was in a stable
mood, said Mr Tang, but at the time of the murder, she had suffered 
from a ‘weaker than normal ability to control herself’.

Gu had reportedly made a full 
confession to police, which it was in her interests to do because it 
will act in her favour during sentencing deliberations. The judges 
reserved their verdict to an unspecified date within the next 30 days.

She will almost certainly be found 
guilty, but could be spared the executioner’s bullet because of her 
defence that she was only trying to protect her son. In a bid to further
lighten her sentence, Gu was said to have made accusations about ‘other
people’s crimes’, although no details were given.

Gu, herself a career lawyer, was defended by a state-appointed lawyer with meagre experience in criminal cases.

As Mr Heywood was a British citizen, 
two UK diplomats were allowed rare access to witness proceedings. 
Friends and relatives of Mr Heywood were also among 140 people in court.

This is the main part of the official account of the trial published by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. It refers to Gu by her official name, Bogu Kailai:

'On August 9, the Hefei Intermediate People's Court in Anhui province held an open trial for the accused Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun on charges of intentional homicide.

'The Hefei People's Procuratorate on July 26,  2012, submitted an indictment to the Hefei Intermediate People's Court, charging that the accused Bogu Kailai and her son Bo became involved in a dispute over economic interests with the victim, Neil Heywood.

'Bogu Kailai believed that Neil Heywood had threatened the personal safety of her son Bo, and decided to kill him. She then arranged for the co-accused Zhang Xiaojun - an employee of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee office - to invite and accompany Heywood from Beijing to Chongqing.

'On the evening of November 13, 2011, Bogu Kailai went to Heywood when he was staying in Room 1605 at Building No 16 of the Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel, and drank alcoholic drinks and tea with him.

'After Heywood became intoxicated, vomited and asked for a drink of water, she poured a poison into his mouth that had been prepared beforehand, and that she had given to Zhang Xiaojun to bring along, causing Heywood's death.

'The Hefei People's Procuratorate believes that the accused Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun used brutal means to commit murder, and the facts of the crime are clear and backed by ample evidence.

'Their actions violated Article 232 of the Criminal Code of the People's Republic of China, and they should be prosecuted for the crime of intentional homicide.

'This case involved a joint offence, with Bogu Kailai as the principal offender and Zhang Xiaojun as the accessory.

'In court, the investigating body put forward relevant evidence, appraised witnesses, and lawyers spoke separately in defence of Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun.

'The legal representative of the family of victim Neil Heywood participated in the hearing and issued an opinion, and more than 140 people - including, friends and relatives of the defendants Bogu Kailai and Zhang Xiaojun and victim Neil Heywood, British consulate officials, journalists, representatives from the National People's Congress and the Chinese People's Consultative Conference and citizens - were in attendance.'
