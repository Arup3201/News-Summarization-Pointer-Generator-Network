A brand new camera drone designed to capture amazing 4K footage from the sky suffered a major malfunction for one owner.

Mark Taylor was out using his DJI Inspire 1, which retails for $2,900, and wanted to test out the auto-takeoff, thinking he would use the device for some real estate images eventually.

Unfortunately, the drone thought that straight ahead towards the garage was the best way to travel up, and was smashed to pieces. 

The drone waits on the ground before it is set to takeoff

The drone, on auto takeoff, is supposed to go up and elevate until it reaches a cruising altitude

Instead the drone flew straight into the garage and was smashed 

Mark Taylor (above) the owner of the drone was not controlling it at all at the time

'Last couple of flights not stable on auto take off - shimming and drifting. wanted to record if it drifted to send to dji to get settings changed or trouble shoot the issues as it crashed earlier in the am - but was fine 2 times after just a lot of shimming and bobbing in the desert in the open or in the subdivision of the house i was trying to film,' wrote Taylor on YouTube.

'We went out and checked everything recalibrated the compass again even though we hadn't moved - and this happened with no operator input just in auto take off mode.'

No word if the cost of the drone gets refunded in this case, or of the device can be repaired.

And it most certainly was not Taylor's fault says Taylor.

'This was not operator error,' he told Peta Pixel.

'To all the people who say I can’t fly, wrong: I have dozens and dozens of flights. [I] started with a Phantom Vision, upgraded to a Guai 840h ground station, you name it.'
