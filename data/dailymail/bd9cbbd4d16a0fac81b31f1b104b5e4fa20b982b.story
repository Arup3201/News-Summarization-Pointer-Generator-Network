Horrified parents allegedly witnessed children as young as five being beaten in an unlicensed Romanian kindergarten after staff forgot to turn off CCTV cameras.

Staff at the Little Kingdom nursery, in the Black Sea city of Constanta, used to leave cameras on each morning from 9am until 12noon so parents could watch their children playing and in lessons.

The cameras were usually switched off at midday when the children were expected to go to sleep. 

But police and social workers investigating the incident say a parent who logged on after that time one day at the end of last year noticed the cameras were still running, and was shocked to see children allegedly being shouted at and abused.

Parents in Romania allegedly witnessed children as young as five being beaten in an unlicensed  kindergarten after staff forgot to turn off CCTV cameras

The cameras were usually switched off at midday when the children were expected to go to sleep

But police and social workers investigating the incident say a parent who logged on after that time one day at the end of last year discovered the alleged abuse after noticing the cameras were still running

Lawyer Stefan Roman, who is representing the parents, alleged they had found that children were given red wine in their fruit juice to make them sleep, and then given coffee to wake them up when the parents were supposed to come to take them home.

On a number of occasions, parents had allegedly questioned why the children had come home with bruises, but were always told it was as a result of being hit by one of the other youngsters in the nursery group. 

Some of the CCTV images were recorded apparently showing the children being pushed, dropped and dragged across the floor when they either refused to sleep or did not want to wake up. 

At one point, a female nursery worker can allegedly be heard shouting: 'If you don't do as you're told you will get a punch in the head, just go to sleep or you will get hit so badly and then I will kick you outside in the cold.'

The nursery is still running due to a legal loophole which meant a change in the law left nobody responsible for closing it down until the criminal case is complete, according to Central European News.

Cristina Ivan, of the local School Inspectorate, said although the nursery was not licensed, there was nothing the authorities could do.

She said: 'It is correct that it is neither authorised or accredited however we cannot go in and search the property and check it matches standards until they request a licence. Not being in our database means we have no authority to check them.' 

Mr Roman said the parents were also suing the owners of the nursery for compensation alongside the criminal investigation being carried out by authorities. 

He said: 'As you can imagine it was a shocking experience for the parents. 

'There were 60 or so children at the nursery. We only have images from two days but it is clear from the injuries the children had that this must have been going on all the time.'

Parents still using the nursery who saw the images on local television recently were told that they were manipulated by parents of a disabled child regarded as a troublemaker and that they were not to be trusted.
