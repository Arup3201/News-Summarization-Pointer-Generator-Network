Sam Allardyce insists he is planning for next season at West Ham.

The Hammers boss is set to be axed after the final game of the season at champions-elect Manchester City due to continued supporter unrest over his tactics.

But Allardyce says he is in conversation with West Ham's owners and doesn't feel his position is insecure.

Down and out: But Sam Allardyce insists he doesn't feel his position is under threat

He said: 'All I can say is I spoke to 
David Sullivan yesterday about arranging our usual end-of-season meeting
 to arrange pre-season and budgets.

'I had no indication that my position was under threat. That's all I can say on it.'

Allardyce
 did however admit the season has not gone as he'd hope, despite 
ensuring the east London club's Premier League safety well before the 
end of the campaign.

The nadir probably came when the manager was booed after a home match against Hull, which West Ham won, and there were also banners calling for his removal at the defeat at West Brom.

Allardyce said: 'As a whole it's been a tough season. It's been rather unique in how it's panned out and we've had our ups and downs.

'But
 we've delivered our goals to stay in the Premier League. We wanted to 
do a little better but we're 12th at the moment and sustaining our 
position in the league was critical to us.'
