A mother and father are staging an early Christmas for their two-year-old daughter who has such aggressive cancer she may not make it to December.

Calianna Griggs was diagnosed with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma last spring.

The genetic syndrome, which affects fewer than 500 people in the world, has created the rare cancer and given her more than 30 tumors on her lungs, one on her adrenal gland, another in her belly and one on her spine.

Tragic: Calianna Griggs, aged two, has been given one month to live after contracting adrenal gland cancer

Last wish: Her parents Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez hope to make her last Christmas the most special

Diagnosed: This is Cali in the early stage of her cancer last spring went she grew three dress sizes in 10 days

Despite undergoing intense chemotherapy twice and multiple surgeries, doctors at the hospital in West Valley, Arizona, have told her parents, childhood sweethearts Greg Griggs and Ashley Gonzalez, that she has between one and three months left.

'Calianna is our precious little angel, she is so sweet and deserves a chance to be with us a little longer,' her mother said. 

But Greg added that it is unlikely she will live out the full three months: 'We want her last Christmas to be the best and we also want for her funeral service to be very special.'

And yesterday, they were delivered the painful news that she could have as little as a day left.

Greg was tearful as he told MailOnline: 'She is in a world of pain that I couldn't even imagine. 

'It is just getting harder and harder and harder.'

The couple noticed something was wrong when Cali ballooned from aged two clothes to aged five clothes in just 10 days.

She is now continuing to swell up and is becoming increasingly lethargic. 

Devastated: Her mother Ashley Gonzalez (pictured with Cali) said she cannot contemplate losing her daughter

Fun: Cali loves dressing up but she is finding it harder to breathe and play as her cancer gets worse

In a recent local TV interview, Greg broke down in tears as he could hear the microphone picking up Cali struggling to breathe. 

'It was just too much. She finds it so difficult. Sometimes now she just sleeps for hours at a time.' 

Her mother updated family and friends on their GoFundMe page: 'She is so swollen now and her tummy is as hard as a rock. But the saddest part is she is struggling to breathe now.  

'I am scared to fall asleep every night because I'm afraid she will stop breathing in the middle of the night.' 

Struggling to pay for groceries on top of the extortionate medical bills, Greg and Ashley are now trying to raise money for a final attempt at treatment to cure her or ease the pain. 

Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is a disorder that affects a handful of people worldwide.

It stems from mutations of either the TP53 gene or CHEK2 gene, which normally act as tumor suppressors by controlling the growth and division of cells.

When mutated, it allows cells to multiply, grow and divide in and out-of-control nature, making sufferers more susceptible to cancer, especially leukaemia, brain and breast cancer.

In many cases, one of the sufferer's relatives will have had a cancer that displays similar characteristics.

Cali's LFS prompted adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer that forms in the outer layer of tissue of the adrenal gland.

The gland is a small organ on top of each kidney that makes steroid hormones, adrenaline, and noradrenaline to control heart rate, blood pressure and other body functions. 

The disease, which affects up to just two million people a year, has a five-year survival rate of 20-35 per cent. 

Symptoms include hair growth, weight gain, a lump in the stomach or back of the head, muscle weakness and high blood pressure.

But with the understanding that it is unlikely to work, the funds will also go towards staging an early Christmas for Cali as well as a funeral. 

'If nothing else this medicine could possibly make her more comfortable while she is here,' said Ashley.

'We also would like to celebrate Christmas with Calianna and are probably going to have to do it early now.'

Gregg was tearful as he told AZ Central: 'She's terminal. I just love her so much.'

Love: Her parents hope to take Cali on a trip and create the magic of Christmas for her in November

Fundraising: They have set up a GoFundMe site to prepare for the funeral and the family's early Christmas

He thanked donors on Facebook, adding: 'We are talking to a company who will make her a custom princess sparkling pink casket as well as a custom head stone. 

'These donations will go towards her funeral service, her medicine, and making her last Christmas here as special as we can. 

'Please continue to share this link for donations and prayers we are very grateful for everyone's support and help.'
