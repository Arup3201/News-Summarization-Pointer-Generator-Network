A speech to incoming college freshmen that was hailed by major news networks as the most 'epic' of all time was apparently partially plagiarized.

Nick Selby, a student at Georgia Tech, lifted part of the speech from his high school debate coach, Andy Stone, who gave a similar address in 2008 that is available on YouTube, Gawker reported.

Like Stone, Selby used theme music from '2001: A Space Odyssey' to punctuate the climax of his speech and he used similar phrasing, though the speeches were about two different subjects.

Starts slow: Georgia Tech sophomore Nick Selby's freshman welcome speech began with typical advice then became an unforgettable address like none other

'If you want to play theme music during your [speech], that's allowed! I can do that! I am doing that!' Stone shouts during his 2008 speech, in which he encouraged students to 'rescue' science fiction.

Similarly, Selby said in his speech to Georgia Tech freshmen: 'If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badaas, you can do that! You're at Georgia Tech! I am doing that!'

Selby claims that he asked Stone's permission to lift those phrases from his speech. Selby was a member of the Speech, Theater and Debate Company at Desert Vista High School and records show Stone became an assistant coach of the club in 2006. 

The rest of Selby's speech seems largely uninfluenced by Stone.

He encourages freshmen ‘to do 
the impossible' and 'crush the shoulders of the giants upon whom we stand.'

‘Our mission as students is NOT to follow in the footsteps of the astronauts, Nobel Prize Laureates, and president who graduated before us, but to EXCEED their footsteps,’ bellowed the mechanical engineering student.

Youtube footage of the address garnered one million views a couple days after it was posted by user Andy Blanton.

‘If you want to change the world, you're at Georgia Tech, you can do that! If you want to build the Iron Man suit, you're at Georgia Tech—you can do that! If you want to play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech—we can do that,’ he screamed. ‘I AM DOING THAT!’

With that bit of self-reference, Selby’s opus was nearly complete.

The incoming freshman, all of them donning the school’s traditional yellow beanie, gave a brief and slightly confused ovation.

'Congratulations,' he smirked before marching off the stage. 'Brace yourselves for a hell of a ride on your way to becoming a hell of an engineer.'

Case in point: 'If you wanna play theme music during your convocation speech like a badass, we're at Georgia Tech! We can do that! I AM DOING THAT!'

Applause: The yellow beanie-wearing crowd of future engineers first gave confused, nervous applause, but eventually gave Selby the standing ovation he deserved

Selby’s popularity has quickly skyrocketed since his speech hit Youtube.

He’s even a caught the eye of some female fans who see great potential in the humorous and brainy sophomore.

A contributor to the blog The Frisky even wrote Selby an open love letter.

Sorry ladies: The aspiring mechanical engineer has a girlfriend and the two appear quite cozy in Facebook photos

‘Dear Nick,’ writes Julie Gerstein. ‘your speech was so powerful…that I now feel prepared to take on a new challenge: making you my boyfriend so hard.’

‘I would like to stand on some giant shoulders with you,’ she went on. ‘Is that cool?’

Selby’s fandom has spread beyond bloggers, as well.

Even ABC News anchor Diane Sawyer has confessed an appreciation for the future engineer.

However, the instant celebrity appears to have a serious girlfriend.

‘Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate’ tweeted Katie Giel, who appears on both his Facebook page and her own looking quite cozy with Selby. ‘I feel like I'm dating a celebrity.’

Protective: 'I can't read these YouTube comments. I'm way too defensive of Nick,' Giel tweeted

Insecure? 'Diane Sawyer just gave Nick a shout out, so I feel inadequate' Giel joked on Twitter as her boyfriend's internet celebrity ballooned Tuesday
