Though it was a sex tape with Ray J that made Kim Kardashian famous, similar videos co-starring Whitney Houston would only diminish her legacy.

The deceased singer reportedly made 'a ton' of sexually explicit videos and took several sexy snaps with her younger lover.

Now, according to Star, the Houston family has been in contact with the 31-year-old, begging him not to release the racy material.

Sex tape scandal; Ray J is reportedly in possession of 'a ton' of sexually explicit media featuring the late Whitney Houston

A source tells the magazine that the 
Houstons have 'been in contact with Ray and told him they do not want 
any photos or videos painting her in a bad light to come out.'

The family 'explained to Ray that now is the time to honour Whitney, not drag her legacy down.' Star magazine reports the R&B singer is conflicted about what to do with alleged tapes.

He's been 'stalling' to sell, knowing
 that though he's 'sitting on a gold mine' he should most likely hand 
them over to her family.

However a spokesman for Ray J has since come forward to deny the reports.

In it together: The couple reportedly dated until Houston's death at the age of 48 on February 11

Scandal number two: A sex tape featuring Ray J and ex Kim Kardashian was released in 2007

Courtney Barnes, spokesman for Ray J told Mail Online: 
'The despicable tabloid report released today claiming the existence of a
 sex tape between Ray J and Whitney Houston is not true,' adding: 'There is no 
sex tape.'

Before adding categorically: 'This story along with so many others have been released to sell magazines. There is no sex tape or explicit photos.'

According to Star magazine, Whitney, who died at the age of 48 on February 11, would have done anything for her toyboy.

She reportedly 'loved doting on him and would have done anything he asked - including making a sex tape.'

The two are said to have dated for the last several years leading up until the time of her death.

Born William Ray Norwood, the singer songwriter is most famous for launching Kim Kardashian's career.

He did so via - of course - co-starring in a sex tape with the now super famous reality star.

The two dated in 2003, and in 2007, a racy video the two made was leaked.

Kim sued Vivid Entertainment for ownership of the tape, but later dropped the suit and settled for $5 million.
