A woman who cheated benefits despite inheriting £115,000 from her wrestling champ dad has been spared jail.

Four days after making claims for income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, Samantha Jordan received a fortune from the estate of her late dad, Mike ‘Flash’ Jordan, the Ancoats wrestler who won a lightweight world championship title back in 1987.

Manchester Crown Court heard Ms Jordan got the money on reaching her 21st birthday, seven years after the death of her father, who appeared in bouts televised on ITV’s ‘World of Sport’ in his Eighties heyday.

Caught: Samantha Jordan cheated benefits despite inheriting £115,000 from her wrestling champ father

Instead of revealing it to the Department of Work and Pensions, Jordan set about ‘blowing’ the bequest with pals, the court heard.

By the time the DWP learnt of it, she had claimed £15,000 in benefits.

Jordan, from Moston, admitted charges of failing to declare a change in circumstances and was sentenced to a 12-month community order, 100 hours of unpaid work, and a requirement to attend a probation service programme.

Paul Hodgkinson, prosecuting, told the court that Jordan, 25, ‘must have known’ the bequest was imminent when she made the benefit claims.

He pushed for Proceeds of Crime Act hearings which would look at whether she had any assets - or whether she really had ‘blown the lot’.

Kirstin Beswick, defending, said: 'Her father died when she was 14 - he was to a great degree an absent father.

'She did know he left her some money, but she wasn’t entitled to it until her 21st birthday and had no idea how much that was.

'Her father was a professional wrestler and he had obviously managed to accumulate rather more money than she had ever seen in her lifetime.'

Ms Beswick said Jordan got the money at a time when she was ‘naive’ and ‘heavily pregnant’.

He added: 'She’s not spent it on anything worthwhile. All her friends helped her spend it, not a single one said "I think you ought to do something else with it, for you and your son".'

Deputy Judge Robert Brown, sentencing, said: 'It was a very, very stupid thing which you did with the money that you got from your father, squandering it in that very short period of time.

'You will no doubt have to live with the consequences for a considerable time indeed - until you have paid off the money that you owe to the department.'
