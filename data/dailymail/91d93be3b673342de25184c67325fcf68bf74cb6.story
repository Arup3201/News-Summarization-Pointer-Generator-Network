A former police officer with the U.S. Marines befriended his teenage girlfriend’s alleged rapist to retrieve a video that the assailant had filmed of the horrific attack.

Elric Shawn Millner, 24, is said to have plied a 17-year-old girl with copious amounts of alcohol and raped her on August 3, 2010 in Webster, Texas.

The teen had no recollection of what had taken place until Millner showed her videos of himself, and others, sexually assaulting her while she was intoxicated and pleading with them to stop.

Defendant: Elric Shawn Millner, 24, is said to have plied a 17-year-old girl with copious amounts of alcohol and raped her on August 3, 2010 in Webster, Texas

In the footage, she can be witnessed urinating and vomiting on herself and can be heard saying ‘no’ while Millner laughs.

The victim protests that she is in pain but her assailant tells her that he knows that she likes it and continues attacking her.

But the woman maintained her silence and the crime went unreported, according to KHOU.com.

That is until the woman, now 19, whose name has not been released to protect her identity, started dating a former-Marine MP.

Location: The assault allegedly took place at this Clear lake apartment complex where the suspect lived

She confided in her new boyfriend about 
what had happened, much to his horror. He made it his mission to 
retrieve the footage to use it as evidence against the attacker.

He feigned a friendship with Millner and made disparaging remarks about the woman in question in an attempt to win his trust.

Millner ended up confirming the allegations and showing the woman’s boyfriend the videos.

But rather than taking his own revenge, the man encouraged his girlfriend to report Millner’s vile acts to the police.

Millner was arrested and charged with sexual assault on Thursday. His bond was set at $50,000, according to KTRK.

The video will be used as evidence against the man.
