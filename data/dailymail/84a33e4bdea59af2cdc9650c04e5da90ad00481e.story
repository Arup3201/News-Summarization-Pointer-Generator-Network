A visit by the biggest cruise liner to ever enter the Italian lagoon city of Venice sparked anger among campaigners who claimed the ship blocked views and polluted the air.

The 140,000 tonne MSC Divinia swept past St Mark's Square on Saturday while protestors on the shoreline waved banners which read 'No Big Ships'. 

The liner which can carry more than 4,500 people is named in honour of screen legend Sophia Loren and was christened by the Italian star last month in Marseille.

The protesters, who belong to the No Big Ships Venice Committee have written an open letter to Ms Loren calling on her to ditch her endorsement of the monster ship.

The group wrote: 'We can't believe that you want your name, which is a legend in Italy and the world, to be associated with a ship that contributes to the destruction of Venice, part of humanity's heritage.

'We are asking you to give up your role as godmother of the ship. Venice and the world would see that as a divine gesture. Venice belongs to the world. Help us save it.'

Since the wreck of the Costa Concordia in January, environmentalists have stepped up their efforts to have large cruise ships banned from the lagoon which surrounds the historic centre of the canal city.

The Concordia capsized off the coast of the Tuscan island of Giglio after it hit rocks. At least 30 people were killed and two are still unaccounted for.

That disaster put the spotlight on the Venice lagoon, one of Italy's most delicate maritime area.

Big cruise ships enter the city to drop off passengers conveniently close to the historic centre and the Grand Canal.

The letter to Ms Loren said the big ships pollute the air and their vibrations and the lapping waves caused by the wakes of their passage hurt the foundations of historic palaces and churches.

The letter said: 'Venice and its lagoon are both world heritage sites and risk an environmental disaster every day because of the passage of these monsters of the sea.'

Italia Nostra (Our Italy), the country's leading conservation group has also long been opposing the entry of large cruise ships into the lagoon. 

The Divina has a first-class suite named after Loren which is decorated with large pictures of the Oscar-winning actress at various stages of her film career.

The liner, which is 330m long and features 1,739 cabins, has a top traveling speed of 23.7 knots.

On board the luxurious new ship there are lifts for passengers, an infinity pool, restaurants, casino and disco.

Silvio Testa, the campaign group's spokesman, said to The Independent his biggest concern was pollution from the huge vessel.

He said: 'This thing produces the same amount of pollution in an hour as 15,000 cars.

'Not only that - the pollution contains 15 times as much sulpher as car fumes. That's why we want this huge vessel banned from the lagoon.'

Following the Concordia disaster the Italian government banned the close approach of vessels weighing more than 40,000 tonnes.

But liner companies taking passengers to Venice are able to get around the ban because alternative routes in and out of the main port do not exist.
