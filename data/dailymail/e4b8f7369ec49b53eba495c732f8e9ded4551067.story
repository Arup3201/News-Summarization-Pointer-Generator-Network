Britain’s victory in the First World War must not be celebrated, the minister in charge of marking the centenary of the Great War has warned.

Helen Grant said although the war was an ‘absolute vital victory’ for Britain there should be no ‘triumphant fanfares’ throughout the next four years of commemorations.

But historians warned the stance showed a ‘lack of understanding’ about how the war was won.

Events to mark the centenary of the First World War must not repeat the jubilant scenes in 1918 when the Armistice was announced, ministers warned

David Cameron has pledged a ‘truly national commemoration’ in 2014 to remember the start of the ‘war to end all wars’.

The Prime Minister has promised a four-year £50million programme to commemorate the 100-year anniversary, culiminating in events in 1918 to mark the end of the conflict.

But Miss Grant warned against striking the wrong tone, insisting there must be no ‘daning in the streets.

She wrote in The Lady magazine: ‘We won't be shying away from the fact that, in the end, it was an absolutely vital victory for us that changed the course of world history in countless ways, but we won't be celebrating that fact or sounding triumphant fanfares.

‘Don't forget that, as well as changing history, the conflict claimed the lives of around sixteen million people across the world, and injured a further twenty million.

‘The tone has to be right, not four years of gloom and misery, but no dancing in the street either.’

The government has promised a four-year £50million programme of events to mark the centenary of the First World War

The government has been faced with a 
difficult balancing act over how to mark the war, in which Britain 
emerged victories but millions died.

Historian
 Gary Sheffield, Professor of War Studies at the University of 
Wolverhampton said: ‘What I think they’ve got wrong, and it’s caused 
some concern among military historians for example, is that among the 
great set-piece commemorations they are not including the great 
victories of 1918 which actually ended the war.

‘That shows a lack of understanding of the basic facets of the history of the First World War,’ he told The Times.

‘I
 think avoiding triumphalism is absolutely correct. Nobody wants a 
triumphalist approach. But we’ve got to be aware that celebrating can 
mean different things. Celebrating in the sense of acknowledging the 
national effort made during the war is entirely appropriate.

‘We
 must not lose sight of the fact that the war was fought by Britain to 
counter largely German aggression and involved a huge national effort on
 the battle front and home front.’

The
 debate follows a row sparked by Education Secretary Michael Gove when 
he suggested popular shows like Blackadder were being used as a 
propaganda tool by ‘left-wing academics’.

Mr
 Gove told the Daily Mail that the left insisted on peddling myths about
 the First World War, which have served to ‘denigrate virtues such as 
patriotism, honour and courage’.

Tory minister Helen Grant said there must not be four years of gloom and misery, but also 'no dancing in the street either' while Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has also cautioned against a triumphalist tone

He wrote: ‘The conflict has, for many, been seen through the fictional prism of dramas such as Oh! What A Lovely War, The Monocled Mutineer and Blackadder, as a misbegotten shambles - a series of catastrophic mistakes perpetrated by an out-of-touch elite. Even to this day there are left-wing academics all too happy to feed those myths.’

His remarks saw him clash with Blackadder star Sir Tony Robinson who accused Mr Gove of making a ‘very silly mistake’.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt also waded into the argument condemning the Conservatives for attempting to politicise the 2014 anniversary of the start of the war.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg later stepped in to insist the Government was taking a ‘dispassionate’ reflection of the lessons learnt from the ‘shocking scale of bloodshed’.

Last night Mr Hunt told The Times he was pleased the Government had now adopted a more reflective and respectful tone following Ms Grant's comments.
