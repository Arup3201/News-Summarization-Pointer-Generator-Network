Star Wars creator George Lucas has made millions from merchandise on the back of his famous films, but even he would surely never have dreamt of this.

A French fast food chain has revealed a promotional snack which really has gone to the Dark Side, a Star Wars-inspired burger with completely black buns.

The burger chain Quick cooked up the black-looking bun - named Dark Vador - to tie in with the release of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace in 3D.

Peckish: The Star Wars burger has a distinctly overdone look

Although the buns look like decidedly 
burned, they are in fact simply dyed, and have two beef patties with 
cheese, lettuce and tomato inbetween.

The relevance is questionable given that Darth Vader only appears in The Phantom Menace as 10-year-old Anakin Skywalker.

As
 well as the Dark Vador burger, Quick have also created an 
only-slightly-more appealing Jedi burger, and a Dark Burger, based on 
Darth Maul.

These aren't the burgers you're looking for: The Dark Vador burger features completely black buns, which are dyed rather than burnt.

The meals will be served until March 1 this year - although any Brits who have ever had to fill up at the fast food outlets on long journeys around the country may decide they are yet another reason to steer clear.

The stunt is not the first time the French fast food chain have raised eyebrows with their promotional material.

In February 2010 the chain decided to 
serve only halal meat in eight restaurants, sparking criticism from 
politicians that its menu discriminates against non-Muslims.

The French chain previously raised eyebrows when it introduced halal-only menus in February last year

And in November 2010, Quick said it intended to offer foie gras 'burgers' at bargain prices as a treat for customers ahead of Christmas.

Quick burger's 'Supreme Foie Gras' consisted of the normally expensive duck foie gras, beef, relish and lettuce and go on sale for only 5 euros ($6.57) at more than 350 outlets across France.
